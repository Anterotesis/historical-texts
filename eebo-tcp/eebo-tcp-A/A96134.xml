            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the time that <hi>Baſilius</hi>
King of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> with <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necea</hi>
his Queen, and his
two renowned daughters,
the Paragons of the World, <hi>Pamela</hi>
and <hi>Philoclea,</hi> were retired from the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:153743:13"/>
Court to a private lodge amongſt the
ſhepherds, there to refreſh themſelves
with their pleaſant &amp; harmleſs ſports.
In the time that <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> ſon and heir
to the good <hi>Evarchus</hi> King of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
disguiſed himſelf to an Amazo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
Ladie, for the love of his Venus,
the ſweet <hi>Philoclea.</hi> And <hi>Muſidorus</hi>
Prince of <hi>Thaſſalia</hi> disrobed himſelf
of his glorions rayment, and put on
Shepherds weeds, for the ſight of the
ſtately <hi>Pamela.</hi> And when <hi>Cupid</hi>
displayed his quivers throughout his
circle, and brought the famouſeſt
Princes in the world to adore his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
beautie: Then Prince <hi>Plangus,</hi>
ſon to the King of <hi>Iberia,</hi> at the firſt
view of <hi>Erona,</hi> a Queen in <hi>Lydia,</hi> was
made a Priſoner to her who was a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.
And he whoſe reſolutions were
altogether fixed on the rare beautie
of <hi>Erona,</hi> reſolved with himſelf, either
to releaſe his incomparable Jewel out
of a dolefull Priſon, or elſe to looſe
his life in the enterpriſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:153743:13"/>
Then he became an humble ſuitor
to <hi>Artaxia,</hi> Queen of <hi>Armenia,</hi> under
whoſe cuſtodie the fair Ladie was, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
her his life was bound up in <hi>Ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's.</hi>
And then would he vow it was
pitie ſo ſweet a creature ſhould paſs by
the pleaſures of her life in ſo ſolitarie
a place. And ſometimes he would
pray for her, and then again he would
praiſe her. But <hi>Artaxia</hi> would no
ways be perſwaded to any compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
the more he deſired, the more ſhe
denied, which he perceiving, with a
ſoft voice and deep ſigh, he brake out
into theſe words,</p>
            <p>Great Queen, if my grief and
groans cannot mollifie your heart, nor
the rememberance that once I was
your beloved Kinſman, nor yet the
beautie of <hi>Erona</hi> can be a ſufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie
to cure your anger; yet call to
mind ſhe was your royal Brothers
Miſtreſs; and can you imagin that he
would have endured the thought that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:153743:14"/>
               <hi>Eronas</hi> bloud ſhould ſo innocently be
ſhed! no, but aſſure your ſelf, that
whenſoever a drop of it is ſpilt, out
of his aſhes there will riſe a Revenger
to root you out of your Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Artaxia</hi> aroſe out of her throne
with a gracefull Majeſtie, and did
proteſt ſhe would be revenged on her
brothers murderers: for, ſaid ſhe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
my brother did love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<hi>Erona</hi> too well, yet her hate of
him was the cauſe of his being ſlain,
and of his ſubjects overthrow. And
Prince <hi>Plangus,</hi> if your affections be
never ſo extreamly ſet upon <hi>Erona,</hi> yet
I am reſolved to keep her life in my
power. But becauſe you ſhall have no
occaſion given you, to brand me with
the title of Tyrant Queen, in the word
of a Princeſs I do promiſe you, that if
within two years after the day of my
brothers death, you can procure
Prince <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Muſidorus</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of a combat againſt two others
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:153743:14"/>
of my chooſing, to obtain the libertie
of <hi>Erona;</hi> if they overcome thoſe
Knights of my electing, that day ſhall
<hi>Erona</hi> be at her own diſpoſal: but if
my Champions manifeſt their valour
to that height, as to receive the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
the ſame day <hi>Eronas</hi> bodie ſhall
be conſumed to aſhes, and I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to gratifie their courage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plangus</hi> joyfully accepted of this
propoſition, ſince he could obtain
no better. And well he knew the
Princes cared not for their proud
looks, nor feared the glittering of
their ſwords; yet little did he know
the craftineſs of <hi>Artaxia.</hi> But ſuch
ſubtile Policie ſeldom ends with an
happie concluſion.</p>
            <p>And now in hopes of a proſperous
journey, he bends his courſe towards
<hi>Greece,</hi> there to deliver his meſſage,
upon which his life depended. But he
had not travelled many days, before
he had ſurpriſed a Letter, the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:153743:15"/>
was to <hi>Plaxirtus,</hi> brother to
<hi>Leonatus</hi> King of <hi>Paphlagonia;</hi> he
without fear or dread, brake it open,
and read it. He had no ſooner peruſed
it over, but that he wiſhed it cloſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
Then cried he out aloud, Can
it be poſſible? is <hi>Artaxia</hi> ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull
Politician? can her lips utter
that which is ſo far at diſtance from
her heart? and can flattering make her
ſeem the leſſe cruel? No ſure, her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
name will be hatefull to all Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
            <p>See here, ſaith he to ſome of his
ſervants that were with him, ſee
here a Letter from <hi>Artaxia</hi> to <hi>Plexir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
how ſhe praiſes him for a treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
act, how ſhe condoles with him
for the death of <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Muſido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
the two gloriouſeſt Princes that
ever lived in the world; how ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
him to end the Tragedie with a
Comedie; ſhe tels him the Gods ſet
to their help to revenge her brothers
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:153743:15"/>
death; and then ſhe acknoledges her
ſelf and her Kingdom his, according
to her proclamation.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Plangus</hi> was breathing out
his griefs, but had not altogether ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
himſelf, before he was interrupted
by a meſſenger, who not being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
to complements, came to him,
and certified him that he came from
<hi>Armenia,</hi> and that he was ſervant to
that Nobleman, to whom <hi>Artaxia</hi> and
he repoſed ſo much confidence in, to
intruſt <hi>Erona</hi> to be under his charge;
and that now, contrarie, to the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
agreed upon between them, <hi>Plax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>irtus</hi>
had brought the news to <hi>Artaxia</hi>
of the death of <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Muſidorus,</hi>
which had been procured by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance;
and ſaid he, ſhe hath marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him in requital. And by this time
he hath beſieged my Lords Caſtle
where <hi>Erona</hi> is confined. Then my
Lord having intelligence of it, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
ſent me after you, to let you
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:153743:16"/>
underſtand that he was not furniſhed
with conveniences well enough to
hold out long: therefore as you love
<hi>Erona,</hi> ſo come with ſpeed to relieve
her. Now I have finiſhed my meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
and I muſt be gone. So with
leſs reverence than he uſed when he
came, he haſtily went his way. <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
being caſt into ſuch an aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that he let him go at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
without ſo much as inquiring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Eronas</hi> welfare. But at length,
he rouzed himſelf out of his amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and then would have poured
out his ſoul in complaints, had he not
eſpied his news-monger galloping al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
out of his ſight, then ſending his
eyes after him, he made a virtue of
neceſſitie, and contented themſelves
that they were ſpectatours of the
nimble Nag, which ſhewed his unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs
to reſt his foot upon the
ground, before he entered his native
ſoil. This tempted <hi>Plangus</hi> to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:153743:16"/>
his fancie, which he did in theſe
terms, certainly ſaid he,</p>
            <p>There is a charm in Beautie, that
Beaſt do homage to, and muſt obey;
that now makes the Nag to trip ſo
faſt away to do <hi>Erona</hi> ſervice. Shall
I then be worſe than a beaſt? no, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I cannot paſs along with thee;
yet my heart ſhall always keep before
thee. And dear <hi>Erona,</hi> though now I
turn my face from thee, yet my deeds
ſhall always declare to be for thee,
and ſhall endeavour to clear the
clouds that now obſcure thy bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Thus, between hope and deſpair, he
mounted his horſe, and commanding
his ſervants to follow him, he reſolved
to go into <hi>Macedon,</hi> to report the news
to <hi>Evarchus,</hi> of his ſons and nephews
death. For he was perſwaded, that
<hi>Evarchus</hi> would not be backward
from bringing to due puniſhment the
cauſers of his unſpeakable loſs. And
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:153743:17"/>
by that means he thought he might
handſomly ſhew his valour, and prove
it upon his Ladies enemies. Yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
fears would make conſpiracies
within him, and almoſt overwhelm
him, untill he recalled his ſences, and
conſidered, that it was not a daunted
ſpirit that could ſerve <hi>Erona.</hi> Then
ſetting ſpurs to his horſe, he travelled
in a night and a day without once o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
his lips; ſilence, in his opinion
being the beſt companion to a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
mind.</p>
            <p>But at laſt he entered into the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
countrey of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> which was
adorned with ſtately woods: No cries
were heard there but of the lambs,
and they in ſport too ſounded their
voices to make their playfellow lambs
anſwer them again in imitation of the
like. And the abundance of ſhadie
trees that were there, were ſo beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
with the ſweet melodie of birds,
that any one, ſave love-ſick <hi>Plangus,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:153743:17"/>
might think it a ſufficient harmonie to
draw away their delight from any
other vanitie of the world. Beſides,
there were the Shepherds piping to
their prettie Shepherdeſſes, whileſt
they chearfully ſang to pleaſure them
again. In this ſweet place, he ſat
himſelf down, with an intention to reſt
his wearied limbs under a branched
tree, whileſt his ſervants refreſhed
themſelves, &amp; baited their horſes, but
no eaſe could be harboured in his
disquieted heart, his eys being no
ſooner cloſed, but that he imagined
he ſaw <hi>Erona</hi> burning in their unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
fire: at which ſight he ſtaringly
opened them, and determined with
himſelf, that ſince ſleep would procure
no comfort to him, other then Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
ſcenes, he would never enjoy any
contentment before he had ſettled <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona</hi>
in her throne in ſafetie.</p>
            <p>He had not been long in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie,
before he was kindly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:153743:18"/>
the cauſe of his ſadneſs. <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
hearing the queſtion, and muſing
extreamly who it ſhould be that to his
thinking ſhould ask ſo ſtrange an one,
heaved up his head, which before he
had careleſly held down, and ſeeing
onely an ancient man attended by his
two Daughters, and hoping he would
be a companion ſuitable to his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
he courteouſly anſwered him,
that it would be but a trouble to him
to underſtand the occaſion of his
grief, for, ſaid he, it will be too me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly
a ſtorie to rehearſe to you,
unleſs you were in a capacitie to help
me.</p>
            <p>It is poſſible I might do you ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
replied the old man; for now you
are in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> where I am King, and
having retired from my Court to a
private Lodge, which is ſeated in a
Grove hardby, I with my two daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
happening now to walk for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation
into this pleaſant place, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:153743:18"/>
I perceiving you being a ſtranger, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in ſuch a forlorn poſture, I muſt
confeſs it was incivilitie in me to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
you, but my compaſſion would
ſubmit to no cauſalities that could
hinder my deſired knowledge. And
now I hope it will be no inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to you to relate your own Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to me.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Plangus,</hi> with humble reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
excuſed his denial, and beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Baſilius</hi> firſt to grant him his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
ſince it was a fault of ignorance,
and not of perverſneſs. And that he
promiſed himſelf, that he would chuſe
rather to be his Chyrurgian to heal
his wounds, than in the leaſt to marr
or make them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Baſilius</hi> would ſuffer him no longer
to go on with his frivolous civilities,
and telling him they ſhould ſerve his
turn, made him ſit down. Then <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
related all circumſtances in the
ſame manner, that afterward the divine
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:153743:19"/>
               <hi>Philoclea</hi> ſweetly declared to her lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
the admirable <hi>Pyrocles.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me, ſhe told it with more liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and quickneſs of wit, than <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
did himſelf: For oftentimes his
thought was ſtrayed from his ſtorie,
to ſigh, with gazing upon the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
of <hi>Pamela</hi> and <hi>Philoclea,</hi> for he
conceited that in their beauties he
might ſee <hi>Eronas.</hi> But alas poor
Prince! <hi>Cupid</hi> in that had blinded him,
for although <hi>Erona</hi> might deſerve a
large ſhare of praiſes, yet the two Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
could not be paralelled. But
when he had concluded his paſſionate
relation, he earneſtly craved releafe
of <hi>Baſilius:</hi> who anſwered him, that
he governed a quiet and a peaceable
Countrey, and that he ſhould very
unwillingly teach his people the way
of diſſention; but yet he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a Guard of <hi>Arcadians</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
him ſafe into <hi>Macedon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plangus,</hi> in lowly ſubmiſſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:153743:19"/>
with <hi>Baſilius</hi> for that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
believing that time and entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
would amplifie his goodneſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his abilitie. Then as he
was appointing a place where the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadians</hi>
ſhould meet him, his ſervants
preſented themſelves to him, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
him, that the day was far ſpent,
and that it would be neceſſarie for him
to go to the next town, and there to
lodge that night. <hi>Plangus,</hi> very well
liked of their advice, that he might
have the more freedom to contrive
his beſt way to act his part he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
begun to play. Then after they
had ended their ſundrie diſcourſes, he
parted from <hi>Baſilius</hi> and the two ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing
ſiſters.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Eronas</hi> beautie had grounded
ſuch an impreſſion in his heart, that
no other thought, but of her perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
could enter into his. She was his
Image, her he worſhipped, and her he
would for ever magnifie. And untill
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:153743:20"/>
he came near the Citie, he buſied his
fancie in extolling his Ladie. But
there he was received by the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of the Town with as great gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantrie
as could be expected, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the ſhort warning <hi>Baſilius</hi> gave
them, there wanting no coſt that
might be pleaſing either to his eye or
taſt. A ſtately ſupper being provided,
which was garniſhed with a royal
banquet, ſent from <hi>Baſilius;</hi> and all
was finiſhed in ſo gorgeous a manner,
that <hi>Plangus</hi> did aſſure himſelf he
was no ordinarie, nor yet unwelcom
Gueſt. But all the ſweet muſick with
the plentie of delicates was no more
to <hi>Plangus,</hi> than the rememberance of
his own misfortune. Yet having a
Princely care not to ſhow himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull
to the meaneſt ſupporter of
his undeſerved Feſtivals, he would
oftentimes praiſe them for their boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to him a ſtranger, and one that was
no way able to make them the leaſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:153743:20"/>
requital, but they replied, that his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
was as much, and more than
they deſerved or expected. Then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they had a good while parlied to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
upon ſeveral occaſions, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
returned to their houſes, and
<hi>Plangus</hi> went to his lodging, then
proſtrating himſelf before <hi>Cupid</hi> for
his happie ſucceſs in fulfilling of his
own deſires, beſeeched him to unite
<hi>Erona</hi>'s affection as firmly to him, as
his was unmoveable to her; and that
both might be ſo well preſerved, that
at length they might enjoy the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
fruition of real friendſhip between
him and <hi>Erona,</hi> at whoſe name he
ended; and as if he received his life
from thence, he fell into a little ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
which continued for ſo ſhort a
time, that when he awaked, the clouds
were not ſeparated to give way to
the approaching day, that was then
extreamly wiſht for by him, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>By that time he had run over his
thoughts to the end of his intended
enterpriſes, <hi>Phebus</hi> ſpread his beams
over his curtains, which caſt ſo great
a reflection upon him, that though
his eyes were ſtill diſſembling ſleep,
yet the Suns brightneſs made him
gaze about him, and ſeeing it ſo ſweet
a morning, he believed it to be an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem
of his proſperous ſucceſs. In
this perſwaſion he aroſe, and charging
his ſervants to be in a readineſs, he
walked into a Gallerie, where multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
ſtood waiting for his preſence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

the beaſt, which gently received him
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:153743:21"/>
as willing to bear ſo loved a burden,
and ſprightly ambled along: but
<hi>Plangus</hi> was forced to hold his bridle,
and teach his Nag his bounds were
no further than his Commiſſion, by
reaſon of a calling from a young
Shepherd, who ſpeedily running to
<hi>Plangus,</hi> and in a breathleſs manner
he certified him that he was ſent by
his Lord <hi>Baſilius</hi> to excuſe his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
the occaſion being his retired<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to ſo private a place, that with
no conveniencie he could entertain
him there agreeable to his greatneſs,
nor yet to remove ſo far ſo ſuddenly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plangus</hi> requeſted the Shepherd to
return his thanks and obedience to his
Sovereign, and ſeeing it was a matter
of no greater importance, he would
endure no longer hinderances, but ſet
ſpurs to his horſe and gallopped away
with all expedition: but not without
ſome turbulent paſſages that he was
fain to endure, before he could attain
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:153743:22"/>
to his deſired haven: yet at laſt he
arrived under the Dominions of
<hi>Evarchus</hi> in <hi>Macedon,</hi> where he was
welcomed by a companie of dolorous
perſons, who without entreatie would
participate with him in his ſorrows:
but alas! there were few comforters,
all the people ſeeming like ſhadows,
in regard of the miſs they had of their
young Prince, who after he had
brought ſo many Kings in ſubjection
under his proweſs and valour, ſhould
now himſelf be loſt, none knowing
where or how; but perpetually heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening
to ſeveral relations, which put
them into more fears and doubts eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day than they were in before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Muſidorus</hi> wanted not bewailing
neither; for well they knew <hi>Pyrocles</hi>
life was bound up in his, and that he
loved &amp; reſpected the <hi>Macedonians</hi> as
much for <hi>Pyrocles</hi> ſake, as he did the
<hi>Theſſalians</hi> for his own ſake, and that
they learned one another virtuous
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:153743:22"/>
qualities, which were equally diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
between them; therefore the
whole Kingdom groaned under bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſom
calamities for their witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
loſs: but by the enterance of
<hi>Plangus,</hi> who was a ſtranger to them,
their complaints were turned into
whiſperings, and their ſighs into liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenings,
all being earneſt to know
who he was, and the cauſe of his
Poſting from citie to citie towards
the Court. Some would believe the
worſt, and then would ſwear they did
ſee ſadneſs in his face; others would
perſwade themſelves, it was his haſtie
travelling that made him ſeem careful
But <hi>Plangus</hi> not ſtaying to hearken
to their miſtruſtfull uncertainties, kept
on his former pace, till he was come
within a mile of the Palace, where he
was ſtopped by one <hi>Kalodolus,</hi> an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
ſervant belonging to <hi>Muſidorus,</hi>
who hearing of the coming of a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner,
and infinitely longing to hear
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:153743:23"/>
from his dear Maſter, and meeting
<hi>Plangus,</hi> he fell down at his feet, and
beſought him to have commiſeration
upon him, and tell him of the ſafetie
of <hi>Muſidorus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This requeſt ſilenced <hi>Plangus</hi> for a
while, who could not imagin what
reply to make to him: but having
conſidered a little better of it, he
brake his ſilence on this faſhion. Sir,
it grieves me extreamly that I cannot
give you ſuch ſatisfactorie anſwer as I
wiſh I could: however do not afflict
your ſelf, for I dare aſſure you that he
is happie, being a more glorious
Prince, and far greater than all the
Kingdoms of the World could make
him.</p>
            <p>Why? is he dead? ſaid <hi>Kalodolus;</hi>
then all virtue is fled away: but I will
follow thee <hi>Muſidorus,</hi> where ere thou
beeſt, I will not ſtay behind. Then
ſnatching out a Rapier from him that
was neareſt him, he would have ſent
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:153743:23"/>
his ſoul to <hi>Pluto,</hi> had it not been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by the quick eye of <hi>Plangus,</hi>
who apprehending his danger, leaped
upon him, and with violence wrung
the Rapier out of his hand, but yet he
would not be pacified for a time, nor
perſwaded from practiſing his intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
miſchief, till reaſon over-ſwaying
his patience, made him becom a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator
of his own raſhneſs; for ſaid
he, What good can my death do to
<hi>Muſidorus?</hi> ſhall I my ſelf deſtroy, and
do my Prince the wrong? no, I will
live as long as fortune pleaſes, and
guid my ſteps about the world, till I
have found his Tomb, where I will
ſolemnize ſuch Obſequies as may be
thought worthy to be titled the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of ſo worthy a Prince. Then I
will weep my ſelf to tears upon his
grave, to water that illuſtrious Plant,
that certainly muſt needs ſpring up &amp;
flouriſh; for it is impoſſible ſo rare
a thing can be obſcured in the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:153743:24"/>
Here <hi>Kalodolus</hi> ſpeech was ſtopped
by a floud, that would endure no
longer to be hid within his aged car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſs.
And the noble <hi>Plangus</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him with ſighs, as if his heart
would break: then they both lookt
ſo ſtedfaſtly in pitie upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that if a Painter had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
he could not take, nor have a
livelier Maſter-piece of ſorrow than
this lover and ſervant repreſented,
they being both void of comfort, and
equally afflicted, until <hi>Plangus</hi> pluckt
up his dead ſpirits, and adviced <hi>Kalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolus</hi>
to ceaſe his complaints, and not
to ſuffer grief to overrun his patience,
for ſince <hi>Muſidorus</hi> was dead, the
onely ſervice he could do for him,
was to help forward the revenging of
the Actors in his death. And then he
required him to direct him the way to
<hi>Evarchus:</hi> which command <hi>Kalodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
inſtantly obeyed. And guiding
himt brough ſtately Courts, paved
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:153743:24"/>
all with Marble, and compaſſed in
with Marble pillars, that were adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with ſuch goodly proportioned
Statues, that had not <hi>Plangus</hi> been
employed with matters of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
he would not ſo regardleſly
have paſſed by them, without prying
into their Storie; which might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
have been beneficial unto him, to
know the ſeveral tricks of warlike
<hi>Hercules,</hi> as was there curiouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
by famous Antiquaries. But
<hi>Plangus</hi> thoughts were higher flown
than theſe Portaitures could reach to;
thoſe he valued like ſhadows in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of his valiant enterpriſes, that
artificially his invention would lay
before him, as if it were accompliſhed
alreadie. And in that unſatisfied per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
he was brought to <hi>Evarchus,</hi>
whoſe ſight awakened him from his
fabulous fantaſie. And then with a
ſad reverence he kneeled down.</p>
            <p>But the good King would not fuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:153743:25"/>
that, but lifting him up, he entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to uſe no ſuch ceremonies, but
to diſcourſe that which he earneſtly
wiſht to know without any delays. So
<hi>Plangus</hi> being extream willing to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
<hi>Evarchus</hi> charge, though firſt to
bring him by degrees to the hearing
of thoſe mournfull tidings, he began
with this Prologue:</p>
            <p>Moſt gracious Sir, did I not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your wiſdom in governing your
paſſions, far ſurmounting other mens,
I ſhould not ſo abruptly preſume to
be the meſſenger of ſuch unfortunate
news, as now I am. But ſince my life
is hazarded in ſeveral reſpects, I know
your goodneſs will no way perſevere
againſt me, for neceſſitie hath no rule,
and that is the reaſon which now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces
me to manifeſt that unto you,
which I am loth to utter: But I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
my ſelf, that your Majeſtie will
no way deſpiſe the ſovereign ſalve
called Patience, that is a preſent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie
for all afflictions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:153743:25"/>
Know then, great King, that the
mirrours of virtue, the famous <hi>Pyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
your ſon, and <hi>Muſidorus</hi> your ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
are treacherouſly ſlain by the
bloudie plot of <hi>Plaxirtus,</hi> falſe Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to <hi>Leonatus</hi> King of <hi>Paphlago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
and revealed to me by the ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
of a letter of congratulation from
<hi>Artaxia</hi> Queen of <hi>Armenia,</hi> under
whoſe power <hi>Erona</hi> Queen of <hi>Lydia</hi>
is a priſoner; and without ſpeedie ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,
ſhe will be put to death in the
cruelleſt way that can be imagined, by
the ſame inſtruments that expoſed
her Champions to theirs: But yet
Sir, they have left behind them ſo
pretious a name, that their adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
cannot blemiſh: and ſo long as
their better part flouriſhes on earth,
all the realitie that can be ſhewed for
the leſſer, is to go on couragiouſly,
and revenge your loſs, and to give
<hi>Apollo</hi> thanks for their leaving ſo
glorious a memorie behind them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:153743:26"/>
Thus <hi>Plangus</hi> ended, without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mentioning <hi>Erona,</hi> until <hi>Evar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
grief was ſomewhat digeſted:
which he did perceive extreamly to
over-ſway him, by the changing of
bloud in his face, that perpetually go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and coming, would ſometime
wax pale and wan; and then would
fluſh, as if he threatened to make
<hi>Plaxirtus</hi> ſmart for all his villanie.
And in this conflict of ſorrow and
anger he continued a great ſpace: but
at laſt they both yielded to reaſon,
and <hi>Evarchus</hi> wiſely became the
Judge of the Seſſions; for ſaid he,</p>
            <p>It is Juſtice to bring murderers to
their deſerved puniſhments. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you Prince <hi>Plangus</hi> teſtifie your
ſelf to be ſuch an affectionate Friend
to my dear Children, ſhew your ſelf
one in their revenge; you I will entruſt
to be the General of my Armie;
prove as valiant now as you have
ever done; let all your aim be at
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:153743:26"/>
               <hi>Plaxirtus;</hi> and if poſſible, convey
him hither alive, that he may die a
publick ſpectacle of ſhame and terror
before all the People. And I give
you free libertie to uſe your power in
the releaſe of that diſtreſſed Ladie
you ſpake of, for certainly their hearts
are infinitely hardened for any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief:
but for <hi>Artaxia,</hi> remember
ſhe is a woman, and ſubject to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Paſſion as well as man. But
alas! ſhe deſired the deſtruction of
<hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Muſidorus,</hi> and now ſhe
hath rendered her recompence to
<hi>Plaxirtus</hi> for that abominable deed.
O the thought of that Action reaches
further than my compaſſion: but I
will reſign my power to you, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though you grow Victorious,
yet ſtrengthen your ſelf with diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and let not raſhneſs nor faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedneſs
prevail over you. Now
go on with your intentions, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper,
whilſt I end my days in ſolitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:153743:27"/>
               <hi>Evarchus</hi> had no ſooner done, but
he bowed to the earth, as if he wiſht
to be there quickly; and then after he
had ſigned a Commiſſion for raiſing
of an Armie, he withdrew into his
chamber, and <hi>Plangus</hi> waited upon
him to the enterance, and ſo they
parted; one to temperate melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the other to Hope intermixt with
cares: for though <hi>Plangus</hi> was load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with troubleſom imployments, yet
thoſe he took for refreſhments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the foundation of them was laid
for <hi>Erona</hi>'s ſake. But <hi>Evarchus</hi> grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
as he had too juſt cauſe, to think
that he ſhould never more behold the
joy of his heart again; and ſo he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
without the leaſt ſhow of a
contented mind, yet not with a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
rage. A large and rare Theme
might be Chronicled of his wiſely
governed Paſſions; but that is too
pregnant a virtue for my dull capacity
to go on with.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:153743:27"/>
Therefore ſurrendering that to
ſharp wits, I will onely mention <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
happie ſucceſs that he obtained in
<hi>Macedon;</hi> for in ſhort time he levied
an Armie, ſufficient to conquer all
<hi>Armenia,</hi> every one being deſirous to
revenge their Princes quarrel, and
thought it a preferment to be the
meaneſt Souldier; then being all in a
readineſs, they march away. But <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
before he went, ſent his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
to <hi>Delphos,</hi> to know of the Oracle
his Deſtinie, and juſt as he was man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aging
his Armie, in their march they
returned with this anſwer;</p>
            <p>That he ſhould be Victorious over his
Enemies, if ſo be he would be vigilant
in guiding his Forces in a way of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration;
and not to venture to ſhew his
Valour, in over-raſh attempts in a Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vado
before his Miſtreſs, which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
hath been the cauſe of the Rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a magnificent Armie: but he muſt
remember the eyes of all the World were
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:153743:28"/>
upon him as their Defence and Shield,
whoſe wiſdom muſt preſerve them from
their furious enemies.</p>
            <p>This Oracle infinitely comforted
<hi>Plangus;</hi> and when he had given
thanks to <hi>Apollo</hi> for his proclaimed
proſperous Fortune, he kept on his
march to <hi>Armenia;</hi> whom we will
leave for a time.</p>
            <p>Now I will diſcover ſome Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
that paſſed between <hi>Amphialus</hi>
Nephew to <hi>Baſileus</hi> the King of <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi>
and <hi>Helena</hi> Queen of <hi>Corinth,</hi>
how that after ſhe had carried him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
in a Lighter from <hi>Arcadia,</hi> what
bitter complaints ſhe made for him,
untill ſhe had brought him to <hi>Corinth,</hi>
that would be to pitifull a ſubject to
ſtay on; therefore leaving that to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
conjectures, I will onely rehearſe
thoſe particulars that united thoſe
rare Perſons together to both their
abundant felicitie.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Helena</hi> had conveyed her
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:153743:28"/>
beloved <hi>Amphialus</hi> to her renowned
Citie <hi>Corinth,</hi> and lodged him in the
richeſt furniſhed Chamber that could
be deviſed, yet all ſhe thought too
mean for ſuch an incomparable Gueſt:
then ſhe adviſed with her skilfull
Chyrurgeons how ſhe might have his
wounds healed; and had always an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecial
care to ſee the ſalves applied
to them her ſelf; and when all was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
ſhe paſſed away the day with
ſighs by ſenceleſs <hi>Amphialus,</hi> who lay
ſo quietly, that for a great time none
could perceive the leaſt motion of
life in him: but at laſt the Chyrurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
avouched they could find warm
bloud ſtrive for life in his (now in all
likelihood) curable wounds. Which
ſpeech of theirs did make <hi>Helena</hi> waſh
her fair face with her tears for joy,
when before it had not touched a
drop of water, from the time that ſhe
found <hi>Amphialus</hi> in ſo wofull a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
Then began ſhe to diſcourſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:153743:29"/>
with him, as if he could mind her what
ſhe ſaid.</p>
            <p>Tell me dear <hi>Amphialus,</hi> ſaid ſhe,
what occaſion have I given you to
make you hate me? have I not ever
honoured and loved you far above
my ſelf? O yes! and if I had a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
lives to loſe, I would venture
them all for your ſake. But ſince that
is a impoſſible thing, propound to
me the moſt probable way for me to
purchaſe you, and I dare undertake
it, be it never ſo dangerous: But if it
be the Princeſs <hi>Philoclea</hi> that lies as a
block in my way, ſo that I muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
continue where I am, or elſe
ſtumble over it and be made quite
hopeleſs yet let me counſel you as a
faithfull friend, not to engage your
affections to one that is ſo negligent
of it, but rather beſtow it upon me
that will accept of it. Oh hear me,
and have pitie on me, O <hi>Amphialus,
Amphialus!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:153743:29"/>
Then ſhe flung her ſelf down upon
his bed, with a reſolution not to ſtir
before ſhe had discerned ſome ſign of
life in outward appearance. And as
ſhe was earneſtly looking upon him,
ſhe eſpied his eyes a ſtealing open; but
immediately, with a long fetcht ſigh,
he cloſed them up again, as grieving
for their tenderneſs they could not
gaze upon beautie. But <hi>Helena</hi> reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with twentie to his one, went on
with her love-ſick ſpeeches.</p>
            <p>Alas poor Prince! ſaid ſhe, is it thy
hard fortune to receive thy life again
in ſighs? hath ſuch il-favoured ſpleens
no place to ſettle in, but in thy noble
breaſt, which ſhines in goodneſs?
Chear up, dear Prince, and let not
thy greateſt Foe find cauſe to tax thee
with the leaſt blemiſh.</p>
            <p>Longer ſhe would have proceeded
in her bemoaning of <hi>Amphialus,</hi> had
ſhe not been interrupted by the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons
that were in the chamber,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:153743:30"/>
and hearing her voice, came inſtantly
to her, and kneeling down, intreated
her to abandon the chamber, for as
much as her preſence and complaints
cauſed diſturbance in <hi>Amphialus,</hi> and
procured nothing but that which was
hurtfull to her own perſon: and then
they aſſured her, that if ſhe would
forbear his companie, they could
perfect the cure in half the time, that
otherwiſe they ſhould be conſtrained
to be tedious in, by reaſon that her
ſad ſpeeches would ground ſuch an
impreſſion in him in his weakneſs,
that it would be as much as their skil
could reach unto, to keep his wounds
from growing worſer than better.
Theſe perſwaſions of the Chyrurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
had a very great influence over
<hi>Helena,</hi> and ſhe forſaking her former
paſſions, guarded her ſelf with a long
Robe of wiſe conſiderations, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
his chamber without any ſhew
of fondeſs, to the admiration of all
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:153743:30"/>
beholders. Yet ſhe never neglected
the care of <hi>Amphialus,</hi> but diligently
enquired after his amendment, that
ſhe might know all paſſages as pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually,
as if ſhe had been with him.
In this golden mean of Patience ſhe
continued ſo long, till <hi>Amphialus</hi> had
revived ſomewhat his decayed ſpirits,
&amp; the Chyrurgeons had ſo well over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
his wounds, that by degrees he
was brought to walk about his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
but always he would be croſſing
his Arms, knocking his Breaſt, and
breathing ſpeeches to himſelf in ſo
wofull a manner, as would make the
hardeſt heart burſt into a deluge of
tears. Yet all this time he never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
by what means he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
thither, nor any other queſtion
that concerned <hi>Helena</hi>'s or his own
condition. And ſo for a great while
he impriſoned himſelf in ſuch igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
till by the coming of a young
Gentleman, named <hi>Clytiphon,</hi> ſon to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:153743:31"/>
               <hi>Kaleander,</hi> a Noble man of <hi>Arcadia,</hi>
his concealed eſtate, and all other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
that had happened in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia</hi>
from his departure from thence,
were declared to <hi>Amphialus</hi> wonder
and aſtoniſhment.</p>
            <p>For this <hi>Clytifon</hi> was ſent as an
Ambaſſadour to <hi>Amphialus</hi> from his
uncle the King of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate
with him for his recoverie, and
to certifie him of his Coſins deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
out of his Caſtle, by the proweſs
of Prince <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Muſidorus;</hi> and
how they disguiſed themſelves for
the love of <hi>Pamela</hi> and <hi>Philoclea,</hi> with
all the ſeveral attempts that they pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
to obtain their deſired enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.
(As their bringing <hi>Amaxius</hi> to
ſubmit to their mercie, <hi>Pyrocles</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
granted him his life on condition
he would acknowledge it) and finally
to give him notice, that the nuptials
of <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Philoclea,</hi> with <hi>Muſido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
and <hi>Pamela</hi> were onely deferred
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:153743:31"/>
for the time they could hear from
<hi>Amphialus.</hi> This was the chief of
<hi>Clytifons</hi> Ambaſſage, which he care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
obeyed.</p>
            <p>But before he entered into <hi>Corinth,</hi>
the Citie ſwelled with rumour, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one being greedie to know that
which nothing concerned them. But
<hi>Clytifon</hi> knowing it was not a time of
dalliance, haſtened to the Palace,
where he was waited for by <hi>Helena,</hi>
whoſe watchfull eyes and attentive
ears could not paſs by any ſuſpitious
whiſperings, but would always make
ſtrict enquirie of the cauſe of them.
So now ſhe believing the credible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
would needs come down her
ſelf, attended with a train of Ladies,
to welcom the Ambaſſadour to her
Court, when as ſoon as ſhe perceived
a glimpſe of him, ſhe perfectly knew
him to be that noble <hi>Clytifon,</hi> whom
before ſhe had been beholding to for
his excellent companie. Then whilſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:153743:32"/>
ſhe was ſhewing her courteſie to him
for his former civilities, he with an
humble reverence, yet ſupported with
a Garb of Majeſtie, came to her after
the manner of an Ambaſſadour, and
preſenting mightie high commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to her from all the Princes that
reſided in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> ſhe beſought him
to accept of ſuch poor entertainment
as her abilitie could make him. Then
leading him into the Preſence (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the after-noon) ſhe command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a delicate Collation to be ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, which was fulfilled ſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and ſo decently, that <hi>Clytifon</hi> could
not chooſe but ſit and extol their
comely order; and within a while fell
to eating thoſe rarities that <hi>Helena</hi>
had provided for him; but ſhe would
not be perſwaded to taſt of any, her
troubled mind was too full of jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
and fears, to think of pleaſing her
appetite. Sometime ſhe mistruſted
that <hi>Baſileus</hi> had ſent for <hi>Amphialus</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:153743:32"/>
to be tried by the Law for his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Cecropia</hi>'s ſtealing away his
Daughters, that he might have a fair
pretence to take away his life. But
quickly ſhe vanquiſhed that doubt by
another that ſhe imagined to be moſt
probable, which was, that <hi>Philoclea</hi>'s
heart might be mollified, and that ſhe
under-hand had made choice of <hi>Clyti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fon</hi>
to be her Proxie, in wiſhing <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phialus</hi>
to purſue his former Petition
to <hi>Philoclea,</hi> that ſhe with the more
modeſtie might grant him his requeſt.
This fancie of <hi>Helena</hi> made ſuch a
wound within her breaſt, that a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
of ſighs had free paſſage there,
and in ſilence ſhe did think out her
complaints; until <hi>Clytifon</hi> had disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the artificial curioſities with
taſting of their goodneſs, and had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
his natural hunger. Then <hi>Hele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
taking him aſide from the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
that came to gaze upon him, with
many ſhews of grief ſhe conjured him,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:153743:33"/>
that if ever he had been real to any
friend, to ſhew himſelf one to her,
who vowed faithfulneſs and ſecreſie:
but yet if it were a matter of ſuch
weightie importance, as he could not
repoſe ſo much confidence in her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Princes of another Countrey,
yet ſhe entreated him to certifie her
whether it concerned <hi>Amphialus,</hi> or
in his her own ruin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clytifon</hi> had hardly patience to
hear her out, but removed her fears
on this manner: Chear up great
Queen, ſaid he, thoſe cloudie ſhadows
of discontent and fears never do good
but hurt, and wrong your Beautie,
that otherwiſe would be the ſweeteſt,
and the ſingular Flower that could
be found in the large Garden of the
world. Chear up then and rejoyce at
joyfull tidings: for to the amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all, the two ever bleſſed
Princes, <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Muſidorus,</hi> are
by many ſtrange accidents found to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:153743:33"/>
be alive, though disguiſed, within my
Sovereigns Lodges (from being gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
Souldiers) the one to a woman,
the other to a comely Shepherd,
which was brought to paſs by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie
of blind <hi>Cupid,</hi> who takes
pleaſure in wounding the beſt of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
ſpirits. But yet he hath dealt
ſo favourable with theſe incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Perſons, that he hath equally
wounded <hi>Pamela</hi> and <hi>Philoclea</hi> to
them again: ſo that now <hi>Arcadia</hi>
waits onely for the nuptials finiſhing,
to be made happie in having ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a Prince to reign over them, and
that is delayed onely for the time
that they might hear from my Lord
<hi>Amphialus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Helena</hi>'s joy at the hearing of this
news, was too great for my dull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
yet after ſhe had moderated
her exceſſive mirth, and brought it
within the bounds of reaſon, ſhe fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that <hi>Amphialus</hi> would be ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:153743:34"/>
with deſpairing grief, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but death could end his miſerie.
Then fell ſhe at <hi>Clytifon</hi>'s feet, and
begged of him not to be over-haſtie
in declaring his Ambaſſage to <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alus,</hi>
but to compaſs him in by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
to the hearing of it. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of hers <hi>Clytifon</hi> courteouſly
promiſed to perform. And ſhe guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to <hi>Amphialus</hi> chamber door,
deſired him to walk in, and departed.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Amphialus</hi> eſpying <hi>Clytifon,</hi>
and leaping upon him, and then lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly
embracing him, ſaid, How
doeſt thou <hi>Clytifon?</hi> thou lookeſt as if
thou meanedſt to chide me; but ſpare
your labour, I will do that my ſelf,
nay, and more if <hi>Philoclea</hi> would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
it, let her deſire my heart and
ſhe ſhall have it, and with mine own
hand Ile pluck it out to give her, yet
think it all too little to excuſe my
crime. But ſhe is gratious and noble,
anſwered <hi>Clytifon,</hi> and will be readier
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:153743:34"/>
to forgive, than you can be to begge
your pardon of her. But I will never
preſume to aske forgiveneſs, replyed
<hi>Amphialus,</hi> ſince I deſerve all puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Though you do, ſaid <hi>Clytifon,</hi>
yet if you will preſent your ſelf unto
her in an humble and ſubmiſſive way,
and caſt off your former Suit, I durſt
aſſure you ſhe would not onely grant
your life, but would alſo receive you
to her favour as her near Kinsman. If
I could think ſo, replied <hi>Amphialus,</hi>
I ſhould be highlie contented far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
my deſerts or wiſhes, and ſaid
<hi>Clytifon,</hi> would you be pleaſed to
hear that ſhe were married to another
or elſe likelie to be ſo ſuddainly? Yes
with all my ſoul anſwered <hi>Amphialus,</hi>
but yet upon condition, that it may be
to her all flouriſhing happineſs. As for
my own particular, that is the leaſt
thing I regard or hope for, onely as
I ſaid before, that the Princeſs <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea</hi>
may be endowed with all felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:153743:35"/>
that will procure to me an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled
bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Clytifon</hi> asked him if he
would accept of him to be the bearer
of a letter from him to <hi>Philoclea?</hi>
which he promiſed carefully to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
if it were ſuch an one as might be
received without ſcruple. <hi>Amphialus</hi>
anſwered he would gladly write to
<hi>Philoclea,</hi> but it ſhould no way be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to him, he intending onely to
manifeſt his grief for her ill uſage in
his Caſtle; and to let her know how
readie he was to welcom any puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhe would inflict upon him.
Then after more ſuch ſpeeches paſſed
between them, <hi>Clytifon</hi> rehearſed the
truth of his meſſage. Which at firſt
<hi>Amphialus</hi> heard with trembling, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<hi>Clytifon</hi> remembered him of his
former diſcourſe, that nothing that
could make <hi>Philoclea</hi> happie, ſhould
ever make him unhappie. Then rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
up himſelf, he wiſhed <hi>Clytifon</hi> to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:153743:35"/>
leave him to his privacie, that he
might have the more libertie to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
a letter worthie of her accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
<hi>Clytifon</hi> being to carrie it away
the next morning. So he, without
the leaſt contradiction, left <hi>Amphia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
who being alone fell into a paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(as afterward he confeſſed) that
had almoſt made him ſenſeleſs, untill
time that wears out all things, recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his memorie back to him again,
which firſt discovered it ſelf thus:</p>
            <p>Alas miſerable <hi>Amphialus!</hi> thou
imployeſt thy ſelf to extol thy Rival,
and meaneſt to make it thy recreation
to do ſo always. Now I can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the <hi>Amazon</hi> Ladie that fought ſo
gallantly with me in the <hi>Arcadian</hi>
woods, for the Princeſs <hi>Philoclea</hi>'s
Glove; what blows ſhe ſtrook at me,
and with what nimbleneſs ſhe avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
mine, when I aimed at her in mine
own defence. I muſt confeſs it daunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me to ſee a woman rant ſo over
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:153743:36"/>
me, but yet it made me the more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
her valour, and brought down
my former loftineſs, to wonder at my
timourouſneſs. But ſince ſhe is disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to be the noble <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> I ſhall
be ſo far from hiding that disguiſed
exploit of his, that I ſhall blazon it
about the world in triumph, as an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
for me to be overcome by him;
and it ſhall never be ſaid, that envie of
my Rival ſhall make me obſcure his
worth, for I ſhall applaud his wiſdom
in making ſo rare a choice. Nor did
I ever hear of any that could deſerve
him better than the divine <hi>Philoclea.</hi>
Then grieve no more <hi>Amphialus,</hi> at
thy Ladies happineſs, ſince in hers all
thine conſiſts; but prepare thy ſelf to
obey her commands, be they never ſo
contrary to thy nature.</p>
            <p>With theſe reſolutions, although
with a ſhaking hand, he began to write
his letters. But <hi>Clytifon,</hi> as ſoon as he
came out of the chamber, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:153743:36"/>
by <hi>Helena,</hi> to whom he rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Amphialus</hi> and his whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
And ſhe being in hope to
make him a fortunate meſſenger for
her proceeding, uſed him with all the
courteſie that could be. And then by
her favours ſhe enticed him to her
bait, and made him as much her
humble ſervant, as he was <hi>Amphialus:</hi>
For then he had promiſed to be a
nimble Poſt to them both: and he
muſt be conducted to his lodging,
and <hi>Helena</hi> to her cloſet.</p>
            <p>Where ſhe began too hard a task
for her diſtracted mind, a letter ſhe
did write unto <hi>Philoclea,</hi> but that did
no way pleaſe her, it was not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
adorned with Rhetorick for ſo
rare a Princeſs. Another ſhe did like
reaſonable well, but that was ſo blur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with her tears, that the beſt of
eyes could not read it. More ſhe
wrote, and found blemiſhes in them
all. But at laſt being tired with ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:153743:37"/>
ſo long upon one ſubject, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
that the next ſhould go what
ere it were, which in earneſt proved
the worſt of all. But yet becauſe you
ſhall underſtand the enditment of it,
it is ſet down as enſueth. The <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription</hi>
was,</p>

            <p>Often did ſhe peruſe this Letter to
find out cavils in it, until ſleep would
endure no longer to be reſiſted, nor
hindered from ſeizing on ſo pure a
ſoul, which ſhe evidenced by letting
her letter fall out of her delicate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
hand that held it: then fell
ſhe into ſlumbers, and ſtarts would
now and then afright her, but thoſe
ſhe ended with ſighs, and fell aſleep
again, and then ſhe paſſed away the
remainder of the night with varietie
of dreams, untill the approching day
rouſed up her ſenſes, and remembered
her it was high time for Lovers to be
ſtirring. Then ſhe being always mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of ſuch obſervations, took her
letter, and making it fortunate with
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:153743:38"/>
her prayers, ſhe carried it into the
Preſence, where ſhe ſtayed for <hi>Clyti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fon,</hi>
who was receiving his farewel
of <hi>Amphialus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For after <hi>Amphialus</hi> had finiſhed
his humble ſuit, as he termed it, and
had endured a tedious night, <hi>Clytifon</hi>
muſt needs be ſent for to preſcribe the
likelieſt medicine for a love-ſick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie.
<hi>Clytifon</hi> could not be asked
an harder queſtion, for he himſelf
would gladly have taken Phyſick, had
he been ſure of the cure. Tell me
<hi>Clytifon,</hi> ſaid he, is there no help for
a troubled mind? no cordial to bring
ſleep into theſe eyes of mine? If you
will ſubmit your actions, replied <hi>Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifon,</hi>
to my approbation, I will ſet
you in a perfect way of quietneſs,
though it ſhould procure mine own
endleſs miſerie. He deſerves no Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician,
anſwered <hi>Amphialus,</hi> that will
not accept of his advice, when it is ſo
freely profered him. Know then, ſaid
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:153743:38"/>
               <hi>Clytifon,</hi> your onely way to obtain
contentment, is to honour, nay, and
love her who ſo entirely loves and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
you. O ſtay there, cried out
<hi>Amphialus,</hi> and do not weigh me
down with clogs of grief, I am bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced
ſufficiently alreadie, why do
you with more burdens ſtrive to ſink
me? nothing but <hi>Philoclea</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
I find can enter into my heart,
and they may ſtrike me dead. Flie
then <hi>Clytifon,</hi> flie as ſwiftly as <hi>Phoebus</hi>
can, and make a quick return to let
me know <hi>Philoclea</hi>'s cenſure equal to
my deſerts. With theſe words he
gave <hi>Clytifon</hi> his letter, and with a
ſad geſture turned away. But <hi>Clytifon</hi>
without deferring went his way;
though firſt he received <hi>Helena</hi>'s, and
with many proteſtations vowed to
further her undertakings.</p>
            <p>And now I will leave theſe two
lovers in longing expectation of his
return, and will trace along with <hi>Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifon</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:153743:39"/>
to accompanie him, he being
deſtitute almoſt of any comfort, by
reaſon his affections were ſo extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
engaged to <hi>Helena</hi>'s beautie, that
nothing but envious death could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage
it. This cauſed ſuch a conflict
to ariſe between <hi>Cupid</hi>'s discharged
Bowe, and <hi>Clytifon</hi>'s making his own
wounds to gape with contrarying the
God of loves commands, and haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the Miſtreſs of his deſires to
gain her to another: that oftentimes
he was turning back to diſcover his
intentions to her. But this deſign he
vanquiſhed by confuting himſelf.</p>
            <p>It is true ſaid he, I ride apace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
mine own overthrow; but ſince
it was her charge, how dare I harbour
a thought of refuſing? no it is her gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
pleaſure to vouchſafe me to be
her Meſſenger, and ſhall I looſe her
eſteemed favours, which I infinitly
hazard if I do not manifeſt my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
endeavours in gaining <hi>Amphialus</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:153743:39"/>
to be her Husband, but I will chooſe
to be her loyal Servant, rather than
to her ſweet ſelf an importunate Suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
And I ſhould account my ſelf
ever happie, could it lie in my power
to further hers; but I am unworthy to
receive ſuch a Title as a poor Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to redeem her Majeſtie to her
former felicitie: however I will ſhew
my willingneſs, by my nimbleneſs; and
then teaching his Steed to give a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
caper, he ſpeedily rode away,
and without the leaſt hinderance he
quickly ſet footing in the Countrey
of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> where he was welcomed
by Peals of Bels, and Shoutings of
People, with varietie of ſports con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
by young children: beſides
the pleaſant Shepherds blowed their
pipes, whileſt the prettie Sheperdeſſes
chanted out their praiſes of their
great God Pan. All theſe harmleſs
paſtimes were ordered ſo convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that he might have a perfect view
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:153743:40"/>
of them as he went by: and all was
to declare the joy they conceived
for <hi>Clytifon</hi>'s ſafe return, whoſe ſtay
they heard was the onely delayance
of the Princes Nuptials. And as he
rode along, the ſilly Lambs did wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
him with leaps, whileſt the Fox
that lurked in his private corner to
catch them, discovered himſelf to do
homage unto <hi>Clytifon,</hi> and by that
means loſt his game; yet he chearing
himſelf up with hopes of a more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
prey hereafter, returned to his
former craft, and received that mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
as a juſt recompence of his
careleſneſs.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Clytifon</hi>'s thoughts were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up by ſundrie objects, till he had
traced along ground ſo far as to the
Citie of <hi>Matenia:</hi> there he might ſee
Noble Perſonages glorie with their
imployment, and to eſteem them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be regarded were they not
ſet to work. There he might behold
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:153743:40"/>
the Palace richly furniſhing, and all
the houſes gaudily decking up. There
he might hear of abundance of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
inventions for Masques, &amp; other
curious ſights that might be delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to the eye. But <hi>Clytifon</hi> paſſed
by all theſe rare Scenes, they being in
compariſon of his fantaſie, by him
reputed ſuperfluous.</p>
            <p>And now his eye was fixed upon
the Lodge that ſhadowed the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the world, and was ſeated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
two miles diſtance from <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi>
Thither with eagerneſs he goes,
where he was onely ſaluted by
the diligent ſervants that directed
him to the grove adjoyning to the
Lodge, where the Princes juſt before
were walked for recreation. Then as
he went gazing about him, he diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Evarchus</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> who
ſignified his joy for his Sons and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews,
to him, revived lives, by his
lifted up hands and eyes, which with
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:153743:41"/>
great devotion he rendered to the
Gods in thankfulneſs.</p>
            <p>For it happened after <hi>Plangus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
from <hi>Macedon</hi> with an Armie,
<hi>Evarchus</hi> fearing his love-lines would
give opportunitie for ſadneſs to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
his languiſhing ſpirit, made a
journey into <hi>Arcadia</hi> to viſit his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Friend <hi>Baſilius.</hi> And after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſtrange accidents had apparently
been discovered, as the famous Sir
<hi>Philip Sydney</hi> fully declares, <hi>Pyrocles</hi>
and <hi>Muſidorus</hi> were found to be alive;
and now he tarried in <hi>Arcadia</hi> to ſee
his bleſſedneſs compleated in their
Marriages. And in the mean time he
diſpatched a meſſenger to <hi>Plangus</hi>
to encourage him with thoſe wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com
tidings. And then the good
King confined himſelf wholy to the
continual praiſes of the Divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
for his unlooked for comfort.
And now ſtraying from the reſt of
the Princely companie, he fell to his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:153743:41"/>
wonted contemplations, and never
moved from his devout poſture, till
<hi>Clytifon</hi>'s ſuddain approach into his
ſight, made him ſtart, and withall rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Evarchus</hi> examined him
how the noble Gentleman <hi>Amphialus</hi>
did? but <hi>Clytifon</hi> was ſo mightily
daſhed with his diſturbing of <hi>Evar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
that he let ſilence be both his
Anſwer and Pleader for his preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which <hi>Evarchus</hi> perceiving,
brought him into that ſolitary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
where <hi>Pyrocles</hi> in his diſguizement
had the priviledge to reſort: There
ſate <hi>Baſilius</hi> with <hi>Genecea</hi> his Queen,
and he lovingly condoling with her
for her former ſufferings that ſhe was
then a ſounding in his attentive ears,
but at <hi>Evarchus</hi> and <hi>Clytifons</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance
they roſe up, and graciouſly
ſaluting <hi>Clytifon,</hi> they commanded
him to repeat thoſe Adventures that
had befallen him at <hi>Corinth,</hi> if they
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:153743:42"/>
were remarkable; but <hi>Evarchus</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with them to have patience,
that <hi>Philoclea,</hi> whom it moſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
might hear as ſoon as any; then
they all went to the young Princes,
and found them ſo well imployed,
that had they not eſpied them, they
would in pitie have paſſed by, and
not diſturbed them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Muſidorus</hi> being ſeated
upon a Fountaines brim, where in the
middle <hi>Cupids</hi> Image was placed, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
the ſecond time to have wounded
them; but they not minding him, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
who ſhould with the comelieſt
grace, and higheſt Rhetorick extoll
their Miſtreſſes; whilſt the faire <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mela,</hi>
with lovely <hi>Philoclea</hi> tied the
trueſt Lovers knot in graſſe, that ever
yet was tied; and now and then would
pick a Flower to ſhew their Art, to
tell the vertue of it; in theſe harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
pleaſures their Parents found
them buſied.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:153743:42"/>
Then <hi>Baſilius</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to <hi>Philoclea,</hi>
told her that <hi>Cliftion</hi> had brought her
news of her ſervant <hi>Amphialus,</hi> &amp; ſhe
modeſtly bluſhing, replyed, that ſhe
ſhould be glad to hear of her Coſins
health; then <hi>Baſilius</hi> deſired them all
to ſit down, that they might lend the
better attention to <hi>Clytifon;</hi> but he
in reverence to his Soveraigne, would
ſtand, till <hi>Baſilius</hi> lay'd his commands
upon him to the contrarie: then <hi>Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifon</hi>
recounted all circumſtances ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that about himſelf, as I have ſet
down; and when he had ended, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<hi>Philoclea</hi> with <hi>Helena</hi>'s &amp; <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phialus</hi>
Letters, which ſhe courteouſly
received, &amp; when ſhe had broken them
open, ſhe read them, but with ſuch
Cryſtall ſtreames all the time drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from her Roſie cheeks, that had
<hi>Venus</hi> been by, ſhe would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
them in a Glaſſe to waſh her
faice withall, to make her the more
beautifull; and then her Servant <hi>Pyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:153743:43"/>
gently wiped them away; but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them yet diſtil, he was angry, and
ſhewed it on this manner. It is a hard
Riddle to me, ſaid he, that a Lover
ſhould write ſuch a regardleſs Letter,
to grieve and mar that face that he ſo
much adored. He would longer have
chid <hi>Amphialus,</hi> but that <hi>Evarchus</hi>
adviſed him to take the Letter from
his ſorrowfull Ladie, which ſhe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
reſigned unto him; and he read
as followeth.</p>

            <p>Whileſt <hi>Pyrocles</hi> was reading this,
the ſweet <hi>Philoclea</hi> ſtopt the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of her tears, till ſhe had taken a
view of <hi>Helena</hi>'s. Then ſhe entreated
her <hi>Pyrocles</hi> to read over her Couſin
<hi>Amphialus</hi> lines to her again. And
ſhe attentively liſtening to his paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:153743:44"/>
Phraſes, the ſecond time ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
her weeping deluge: but the
ſtately <hi>Pamela</hi> ſaid, her Coſin did
wiſely to caſt himſelf into the Power
of her ſiſter, he knew her clemencie,
and conſidered it was his ſafeſt way
to do ſo, before he ſet footing in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then they all perſwaded <hi>Philoclea</hi>
not to grieve for that which ſhe
might remedie, and adviced her to go
and write a letter to <hi>Amphialus,</hi> and
in it to command him to put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<hi>Helena</hi>'s demands. She imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
aroſe, and at her riſing made
the flowers to hang down their heads
for want of her preſence: but her
breath being a ſweeter perfume than
the ſcent of the choiceſt Flowers,
made her careleſs of their ſorrow; for
ſhe not minding them, went her way;
and <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> who could be as well
out of his life, as from her company,
followed after her, and would needs
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:153743:44"/>
wait upon her to the lodge; and
there he ſtaid till ſhe had written her
Letter.</p>
            <p>Which ſhe had no ſooner ended,
and <hi>Pyrocles</hi> peruſed, but that ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Clytifon</hi> was readie upon his
Horſe to receive it, that he might
with ſpeed convey it to <hi>Corinth.</hi>
So after abundance of commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from <hi>Philoclea</hi> to <hi>Helena</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phialus,</hi>
he parted, and without any
remarkable Paſſage, he quickly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to his journeys end: where he
was received between hope and fear
by <hi>Helena,</hi> who hearing of his return,
withdrew into a private room, and
then ſent for him; but as ſoon as he
was entred into her ſight, ſhe cryed
out.</p>
            <p>Good Sir, doe not break my heart
with delayance; is there any poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for me to live? if there be none,
O ſpeak, that I may die! and end my
fears: for if <hi>Amphialus</hi> doom be
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:153743:45"/>
death; I am reſolved not to live one
minute after him. But <hi>Clytifon,</hi> as
deſirous to give her eaſe, as ſhe could
be to ask it of him, anſwered, That
now the joyfull time was near at hand
that <hi>Amphialus</hi> and ſhe ſhould be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
together, and ſhould flouriſh with
all happineſs that could be imagined;
I beſeech you do not flatter me, ſaid
<hi>Helena,</hi> ſuch vain perſwaſions will do
no good, but make my fall the higher,
and ſo more dangerous. Madam, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<hi>Clytifon,</hi> let me beg the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of you to believe me, and if
I have told you any falſhood, ſay I
was never truſtie to my Friend, and
you cannot puniſh me more to my
vexation: but here is a Letter from
my Lord to <hi>Amphialus,</hi> that will ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
me of the truth: Upon this <hi>Hele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
was brought to believe that feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
to her, that ſhe ſo long hath
wiſhed for, and cauſed vermilion Red
to die her cheeks in preparation to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:153743:45"/>
receive their welcom Gueſt: and then
her earneſtneſs grew impatient of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrings,
ſhe longing to prie into <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loclea</hi>'s
letters, therefore ſealing up
her lips from further queſtions, ſhe
directed <hi>Clytifon</hi> to <hi>Amphialus,</hi> and
then ſhe left him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amphialus</hi> in the mean time, whoſe
bowels earned for <hi>Clytifon</hi>'s return,
liſtened to all whiſperings. So then
he ſeeing the Attendants ſo buſie in
their private diſcourſes, he enquired
whether <hi>Clytifon</hi> was come? juſt as
he entered his preſence. Then after
due civilities paſſed between them,
<hi>Clytifon</hi> delivered up his charge to
<hi>Amphialus,</hi> who uſed many ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
before he would preſume to
touch it; but when he was better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed,
he joyfully imbraced it, and by
degrees he intruded upon it, for firſt
he brake the ſeal, and then he made
his proteſtation.</p>
            <p>Now I do vow and promiſe before
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:153743:46"/>
               <hi>Cupid,</hi> whoſe dart hath ſo cruelly
wounded me, and before <hi>Vènus,</hi> to
whoſe beautie I am ſo much a ſlave,
never in the leaſt to reſiſt <hi>Philoclea</hi>'s
lines; but I will ſhew my dutie to her
by my willingneſs to obey her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
And you my Lord <hi>Clytifon,</hi>
with this Noble companie are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
of this my Proteſtation.</p>
            <p>Thus concluded he his ſolemn
vow, and then he carefully unfolded
the treaſure of his life, with a belief
that every fold drew him nearer than
other to Paradiſe: and when he read
it, the curiouſeſt eye could not eſpie
the leaſt motion of discontent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
in him; but he rather ſeemed as a
Conquerour that had ſuddenly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
unlookt-for comfort, which
much conduced to the joy of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders.
And when he had fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
his eyes with <hi>Philoclea</hi>'s gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
lines, he changed his note from
admiring her perfections, to blazon
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:153743:46"/>
his now amorous Phraſes of <hi>Helena</hi>'s
worth; and then the ſweet behaviour
of <hi>Helena</hi> to him in his calamitie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to his memorie, which made
him extreamly wonder at the hidden
virtues of <hi>Philoclea</hi>'s letters, for
working ſo great a cure in his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding:
therefore now aſſuring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the Gods had deſtined <hi>Helena</hi> to
be his Spouſe, in purſuance of their
pleaſure, and of his own happineſs,
he ſent to her in an humble manner to
entreat her companie. Which Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
poor Queen, ſhe heard as joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
as ſhe could have done, had
<hi>Mercury</hi> poſted from Heaven to bring
her tidings of her transporting thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
but yet trembling poſſeſſed her
delicate bodie, and would not leave
her, before ſhe had preſented her ſelf
to <hi>Amphialus;</hi> who taking her by the
white, yet ſhaking, hand, gratefully
thanked her for her many favours:
and then telling her he ſhould ſtudie
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:153743:47"/>
a requital, beſought her to hear the
letter that his Coſin <hi>Philoclea</hi> had
honoured him with. But <hi>Helena</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
with bluſhes, whileſt he read
the letter, thus,</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <head>For her highly-eſteemed Coſin, the

                  <opener>
                     <salute>Worthie Coſin,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>MIght I partake with the Gods in
their intereſt in you, I would not
be kept in ſuch ignorance and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as I am at this preſent; but I
would throughly ſearch what juſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
I have ever given you, to hazard
your perſon with ſuch ſad apprehenſions
of my anger, as I hear without ſpeedie
remedie will deprive you of all future
felicitie. But laying by all that ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
thought, in earneſt, Coſin, I must
needs tell you, how without compariſon
it troubles me, that you ſhould think me
ſo ſevere and unnatural, to torment
you with a ſecond death, for that fault,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:153743:47"/>
which you have by ſo many evident
ſigns manifeſted your ſelf to be innocent
of, and if you had been guiltie as you are
not, I ſhould rather chooſe to mitigate
your crime, than any way to heighten it.
But yet I will not profuſely let ſlip that
advantage, which you have ſo freely
left to my diſcretion, but will uſe it as
an ornament to make you happie, yet not
in way of authoritie, but as a Petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
I humbly crave of you not to refuſe
Beautie and Honor when it is ſo virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
preſented to you by the famous
Queen <hi>Helena,</hi> whoſe love-lines ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes
all others.</p>
                  <p>Therefore if you eſteem of me, prove
it by entirely loving of her, who, I am
ſure, will endow you with all ſuch bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
as may enrich your contentment.
And now with full ſatisfaction, that
you will grant me my requeſt, I cloſe up
theſe abrupt lines, and am immoveably,</p>
                  <closer>
                     <signed>Your faithfull Coſin and

Here the ſweet <hi>Philoclea</hi> ended, and
<hi>Amphialus</hi> with a low congee began
to ſpeak to <hi>Helena</hi> in this manner:
Fair Queen, what excuſe I ſhall make
for my long incivilitie to your ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ſelf, I know not, nor can I imagin
with what confidence to beg of you
the perfecting of theſe compaſſionate
lines; therefore for pitie ſake accept
of my caſt-down eyes for my Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and let your goodneſs plead for
my backwardneſs in ſubmitting to
that duty of love to you, when the
greateſt Princes tremble at your
ſight, and worſhip you as their Image.
Madam, ſuffer your Anſwer may be
pitifull, ſince I acknowledge mine
error.</p>
            <p>My Lord, replied <hi>Helena,</hi> there is no
cauſe given here to induce you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
your grief, if my yielding my
ſelf to your noble diſpoſal may be
valued as a ſufficient ſatisfactory Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to eaſe you, that hath ever
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:153743:48"/>
been my endeavor in all virtuous
ways to compaſs.</p>
            <p>The more may be imputed to my
unworthineſs, anſwered <hi>Amphialus;</hi>
now I am ſurprized with ſhame in
having ſo dull an apprehenſion, ſuch
a ſtony heart to refuſe ſo rare a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
as your divine ſelf; but the Gods
are juſt, for now the wheel of Fortune
is turned, and if you pleaſe to revenge
your wrong upon me the inſtrument,
you cannot ſtab me with a ſharper
ſpear, than your denial.</p>
            <p>Why, ſaid <hi>Helena,</hi> do you force me
to repeat my real affections to you
ſo often? is it your jealouſie of my
conſtancie? if it be that, with thanks
to my Goddeſs <hi>Diana,</hi> I avouch, that
I never harboured the leaſt unchaſt
thought to ſcandalize or blemiſh my
puritie.</p>
            <p>Now I may clallenge you, replied
<hi>Amphialus,</hi> for ſearching out new ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
to your ſelf; but pardon me
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:153743:49"/>
dear Madam, for my raſh preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with chiding you for one fault,
when I my ſelf am burdened with ſo
many, and beleeve me, my higheſt
ambition is to hear your heavenly
voice ſound out the Harmonie of
your love within mine ears; and
when you vouchſafe me that, none
can paralel with me in happineſs.</p>
            <p>Thus they paſſed away the day
with theſe, and afterwards more fond
expreſſions; and amongſt them they
concluded to make a journey into <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia,</hi>
&amp; for the greater Triumph, to
celebrat their nuptials with the other
renowned Princes, now in the height
of their ſuperfluous complements, the
news of the happy ſucceſs of <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea</hi>'s
Letter had ſo ſpread about, that
ſuch abundance of the Citie flocked
to the Palace to ſee <hi>Amphialus,</hi> that
<hi>Helena</hi> was forced to command the
Officers, not to let any have admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
until ſome important buſineſs,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:153743:49"/>
they were to conſult upon, might be
accompliſhed; and then ſhe promiſed
free Paſſage to all: This cauſed every
one to retire to their houſes, and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena</hi>
and <hi>Amphialus</hi> after a while ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
ſome time to adviſe with <hi>Clytifon</hi>
to conſider of the probableſt way for
them to go into <hi>Arcadia;</hi> the people
of <hi>Corinth</hi> being in great expectation
of their ſolemnizing the wedding
there.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Clytifon</hi> counſelled them on
this manner. The ſureſt way that I
can think on is, to lay open your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
intentions to the Peers of your
Land, that by degrees, it may be
publiſhed to the Vulgar; alſo declare
that you will not yield to any thing
that may prove to their prejudice; but
if they will not receive that as ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
but argue that it is a diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for their Country to ſuffer their
Princeſs to depart from thence, and
be tranſported into another, to have
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:153743:50"/>
her marriage finiſhed; you may eaſily
prevent their future diſlike of that
particular; ſince the diſhonour of your
Countrey concerns you moſt; and in
all reaſon you ſhould have the moſt
eſpecial care to preſerve it; you may
pleaſe them with telling them, you
do intend to make your Kingdom fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
by the ſplendor of thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that now reſide in <hi>Arcadia;</hi> and
then you will ſolemnize your wedding
with the ſame points that you uſe
when you are there: and I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
their diſſentions will be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted.</p>
            <p>The Counſel of <hi>Clytifon</hi> was no
way rejected, but very well eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Royal lovers, who ſhewed
their thankfulneſs by the large
Theams they made of their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to him: and then telling him,
that they muſt ſtill be more obliged
to him, they entreated him to let his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to <hi>Arcadia</hi> be a little ſooner than
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:153743:50"/>
theirs, to give the Princely family
intelligence of their following after;
becauſe they were yet in their private
lodge, it would not be commodious
for them to come unto them una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares.
<hi>Clytifon</hi> replied, That none
ſhould do that Service but himſelf;
then <hi>Amphialus</hi> told him it was high
time for him to make good his words,
for Queen <hi>Helena,</hi> and his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
was to be at <hi>Matenia</hi> ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
thus after a few more ſpeeches
paſſed, <hi>Clytifon</hi> took his leave, and
diſpatched away with all expedition.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Helena</hi> gallantly
played her game; for at the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
time of <hi>Clytifon</hi>'s departure from
<hi>Corinth,</hi> ſhe proclaimed free Liberty
for her Subjects acceſs unto her: then
<hi>Amphialus</hi> and ſhe being arrayed in
glorious Apparel, removed from
their with-drawing Rooms into the
Preſence, and there ſeated themſelves
in the Throne: their Nobles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:153743:51"/>
to them in their ranks, and kiſſing
both their hands, rendered in all low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
manner their joy for their Queens
carefull choice, in making ſo brave a
Prince their high Lord. Then <hi>Helena</hi>
declared her mind to them as <hi>Clytifon</hi>
adviſed her, which at firſt ſtartled
them, but ſhe argued in her own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
ſo wiſely, that ſhe quickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
and pacified thoſe diſturbers.
But after them came Knights, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
Citizens, in ſuch abundance,
that they confined the Princeſs to
their patience for a Week together.
Beſides, the Countrey Peaſants, and
all ſorts of Mechanicks, that with
admiration preſſed to gaze upon
them. But when their tedious task
was over, they ſpent ſome time in
pleaſing their fancies with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
of ſtately curioſities, for
the honour of their Nuptials. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phialus</hi>
and <hi>Helena</hi> concurring ſo
well together, that nothing was
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:153743:51"/>
commended by the one, but inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it was highly approved of and
valued by the other. Which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining
of theſe, was a rare example
for the under-workmen, they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to follow their Superiours
Rule, delighting in theſe fellows
judgements, did to the lovers joy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly
finiſh their Art.</p>
            <p>Then all accommodations being
prepared in a readineſs, they departed
from <hi>Corinth,</hi> their pomp being thus
ordered, Three Chariots drawn by
ſix horſes apiece, came whirling to
the gate, the firſt was for ſix Noble
men being of <hi>Amphialus</hi> his Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber.
That Chariot was lined
with green Figerd-velvet, richly frin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged;
ſignifying the Princes loves. The
Horſes were black; to manifeſt their
mourning for being ſo long exiled
from their loves. The next Chariot
was lined with white Sattin, embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
with gold, that was to witneſs
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:153743:52"/>
their innocencie, their love being vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous:
in that went ſix Ladies, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
upon <hi>Helena.</hi> The third and laſt
was for <hi>Helena</hi> and <hi>Amphialus,</hi> that
was lined with blue, embroidered with
Pearls and pretious Stones, the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
wore plumes of Feathers; the
Coach-man, Poſtilian, and ſix Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
liveries were blew, as an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem
of their conſtancie, and embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as the Chariot was. On this
triumphant manner they went to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia,</hi>
beſides an innumerable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of Coaches and Horſ-men that
belonged to the Court; which keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on a moderate pace, in ſhort time
fafely ſet footing there: and the fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
report, that would not be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for any mans pleaſure, quickly
gave notice to the Princes of <hi>Helena</hi>'s
and <hi>Amphialus</hi> being come.</p>
            <p>But they had before removed to
their Palace, being in perpetual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of their companie: and to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:153743:52"/>
ſhew how glad they were to enjoy it,
<hi>Muſidorus</hi> and <hi>Pamela,</hi> with <hi>Pyrocles,</hi>
going altogether in a Coach, went
out a good diſtance from the Citie
to meet them: which they could
hardly compaſs to do, by reaſon of
the multitudes that went to ſee that
magnificent Sight; until they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
Officers to beat a Lane: ſo
that at laſt they made a narrow paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.
It was an incomparable Sight
to ſee <hi>Helena</hi> and <hi>Amphialus</hi> greet
<hi>Philoclea?</hi> what low congies they
made to her, as if ſhe had been their
Goddeſs! whileſt ſhe courteouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced
them again. Then <hi>Helena</hi>
and ſhe ſtood admiring one anothers
Beautie, till <hi>Amphialus</hi> had ſaluted
the other Princes, and yet returned
ſoon enough to break their ſilence.
Ladies, ſaid he, there is no occaſion
given to ſtir up ſadneſs in Rebellion
againſt mirth &amp; happineſs, for here we
may ſee Love coupled together, when
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:153743:53"/>
we have known by experiments it to
have been disperſed by many ſtrange
accidents. And moſt ſweet Princeſs
<hi>Philoclea,</hi> by your gracious lines I am
preſerved from perpetual miſerie, to
enjoy a Crown endowed with all fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie.
But yet, Madam, all that I
can do or ſay in requital, is to let you
know that I am and ever ſhall be, your
humble Servant.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you Coſin, replied <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loclea,</hi>
do not your ſelf that injurie, to
confeſs you were thruſt forward to
your contentment. And ſeriouſly,
when I obtained a ſight of this rare
Queen, I was aſtoniſhed at your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
backwardneſs. But ſince <hi>Cupid</hi>
did play his part ſo cunningly as to
make you blind, I am extream glad
that I could be an inſtrument worthie
to recover your decayed eyes and
languiſhing ſpirits; and I am behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to your goondeſs in obeying my
requeſt. Here <hi>Philoclea</hi> ended; and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:153743:53"/>
               <hi>Amphialus</hi> was furniſhed with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Muſidorus</hi> brought in <hi>Pame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
to <hi>Helena,</hi> whom ſhe civily wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed
to <hi>Arcadia;</hi> but upon <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alus</hi>
ſhe looked aloft, as not deſerving
to be regarded by her. Which <hi>Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi>
perceiving, he ſecretly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
her to look favourably upon him.
Whoſe advice was received by her as
a command that ſhe durſt not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.
So ſhe altering her disdainful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
into chearfulneſs, bent her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to <hi>Amphialus,</hi> that at laſt they
grew excellent companie for one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and ſo continued; till their
thoughts were taken up with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at ſight of <hi>Clytifon,</hi> who came
hallowing to them; and with ſigns
pointed to them to haſt into their
Chariots. But they not underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his meaning, delayed their ſpeed,
till he came nearer, and certified them
that there was a Meſſenger come
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:153743:54"/>
from <hi>Plangus</hi> to <hi>Evarchus,</hi> but he
would not be perſwaded to deliver
his buſineſs, before <hi>Muſidorus</hi> and <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocles</hi>
were preſent.</p>
            <p>This newes ſtrook <hi>Pamela</hi> and
<hi>Philoclea</hi> into an extremity of ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
for then <hi>Plangus</hi> ſtorie was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
into their memorie, which
made them ſuſpect it was ſome envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
errand to ſeparate their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
but their beloved Princes uſed
all perſwaſions that might comfort
them, and then led them to <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phialus</hi>
Chariot, that being the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt,
and in that regard the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient;
they being too full of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity
to minde matters of State,
went altogether, that they might the
better paſſe away the time with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <p>Then in a diſtracted manner they
went to <hi>Matenea,</hi> and quietly paſſed
through the Streets till they came to
the Palace, where they had much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:153743:54"/>
to enter, by reaſon of the throng
that was there making enquiries after
the <hi>Armenian</hi> Meſſenger; yet at laſt
the Princeſs obtained entrance; where
<hi>Helena</hi> and <hi>Amphialus</hi> were with all
reſpect welcomed by <hi>Baſilius</hi> and <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necea:</hi>
and when many Complements
were conſummate, they all went to the
Preſence, where <hi>Evarchus</hi> and the
Meſſenger were. Then <hi>Evarchus</hi>
told them there was a buſineſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
to diſcover, and he wiſhed
them to give audience to it; Then all
noiſe being appeaſed; the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
turning to <hi>Evarchus,</hi> ſaid theſe
following words.</p>
            <p>Moſt renowned King; Prince <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi>
Generall of your forces in <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
hath ſent me to recount unto
your Majeſtie the truth of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
ſince his departure from
<hi>Macedon;</hi> which if your Majeſtie
pleaſe to heare, I ſhall in a little time
bring it about to his preſent Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:153743:55"/>
Know then, Gracious Sir, Prince
<hi>Plangus</hi> had hardlie ſet footing in the
<hi>Armenian</hi> Land, before he was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
by the unfortunate News of his
Ladie <hi>Erona</hi>'s being delivered up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the power of her Tyrannical ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
You may imagine what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
this was to him at his
firſt entrance, to be almoſt deprived of
his chiefeſt victory: but yet he hid
his grief, ſhewing his undaunted ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to his Armie; he doubled their
march, and at length overtook the
Forces of the deceitfull <hi>Plaxirtus,</hi>
and with loſſe of a few men, he ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered
them, that he and all his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
marched through the middeſt of
our Adverſaries, whilſt they like
frighted men ſtood gazing on us; yet
we not altogether truſting to our
ſafeties, to their amazement, placed a
a reaſonable company in Ambuſh to
hold them play, if they ſhould ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to fall on us; and we having In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:153743:55"/>
that <hi>Plaxirtus</hi> himſelf was
but a mile before us, attended by a
ſmall Guard, becauſe of his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in his forces that were behind
him, purſued him: &amp; he not doubting
but that we were of his confederacie,
turned back his Horſe, and ſtaid that
we might overtake him, thinking
thereby to do us a favour: but Prince
<hi>Plangus</hi> not having patience to ſee
him ſo well pleaſed, galloped towards
him; which <hi>Plaxirtus</hi> ſeeing, and
knowing his own guilt, began to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt
that then he ſhould receive a
due reward; and then he cryed out,
Are we freinds? Are we freinds? but
Prince <hi>Plangus</hi> riding to him, claſped
him about the waſt, and gallantly
threw him off his horſe, and then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
him, That he ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
his freind to do him ſuch cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſies
as they were; which the Guard
hearing, they ſhewed us that they
were expert in running, though not
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:153743:56"/>
in fighting, for in a moment they
were all fled away: then Prince <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
having his greateſt Adverſary at
his feet, and ſtudying the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
way to fulfill your Majeſties
deſire, to preſerve him alive, till he
might be more openly put to death:
juſt than a Trumpeter came to him
from <hi>Artaxia,</hi> with a paper in his
hand, which he delivered to <hi>Plaxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
wherein <hi>Artaxia</hi> declared, That
her Coſin <hi>Plangus,</hi> whom ſhe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
civilly in her Court, was riſen
in Arms againſt her, and had brought
Forreigners to invade her Land; and
that he had not onely forgotten her
former kindneſs to him, but alſo bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the laws of Nature, ſhe being his
neer kinſwoman; and not onely with
her, but alſo with her dear and lawfull
Husband <hi>Plaxirtus,</hi> whom he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and made a Priſoner; and ſhe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
declared, That whatſoever cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
be inflicted upon <hi>Plaxirtus,</hi> ſhe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:153743:56"/>
would do the like, or worſe to <hi>Erona.</hi>
And if he did not quickly ſend her a
ſatisfactorie Anſwer, ſhe would begin
with <hi>Erona</hi> firſt, and make her endure
the greateſt torments that ſhe could
poſſibly, and live.</p>
            <p>This put Prince <hi>Plangus</hi> into a
world of confuſed cogitations? for
very unwilling he was to let go unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
the bloudy contriver of theſe
Princes ſuppoſed murder: and if he
did not in ſome degree yield to that,
then this beloved Lady <hi>Erona</hi> muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
thoſe intollerable tortures. But
when he was in the height of paſſion,
to think that from a victor he muſt
become Slave, we might perceive a
Traveller guided to us by ſome of the
Souldiers. At that ſight Prince <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
entreated the Trumpeter to ſtay
till he had known the meaning of the
ſtrangers coming. He was your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Meſſenger, O King, that delivered
the Queen <hi>Erona</hi> from miſerie. He it
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:153743:57"/>
was that brought the joyful news of
the ſafetie of theſe famous Princes to
perplexed Prince <hi>Plangus.</hi> And that
ſo well revived him, that after he had
worſhipped <hi>Apollo</hi> for ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lookt
for bleſſing, he chearfully
dispatcht away the Trumpeter with
his anſwer, that now the Treacherie
of <hi>Plaxirtus</hi> was brought to nought,
for <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Muſidorus</hi> were mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly
preſerved, and lived to be
examples of virtue: and if ſhe would
ſtand to the former Articles, <hi>Plaxir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
ſhould be ſet at libertie, now the
renowned Princes want your aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in defence of the Ladie <hi>Erona,</hi>
whoſe life is now in your power; for
by me <hi>Plaxirtus</hi> an <hi>Anaxius</hi> challenge
you to anſwer them in a Combat for
the diſtreſſed Queen, and if you prove
victorious over them, the ſame day
<hi>Erona</hi> ſhall be freed from her impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment:
but if the contrarie ſide pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
at that time <hi>Erona</hi> muſt be put
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:153743:57"/>
to death. Theſe are the Articles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
agreed upon, and now the ſecond
time reſolved on. If you will hazard
your Perſons in the Quarell, the
whole Kingdom of <hi>Armenia</hi> being in
expectation of your valour, that may
end the differences.</p>
            <p>Thus the Meſſenger concluded,
and <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Muſidorus</hi> ſent him
back to <hi>Armenia,</hi> with promiſe of
their ſpeedie following after him. It
would have made a Rock, had it been
by, burſt out in tears in reference to
the companie. And had <hi>Narciſſus</hi>
been never raviſhed with his own
conceited beautie, yet had he been
there, he would have wept into fount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ains,
to ſee the beſt of Princes tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiled
in waves of affections: And
Fortune deluding them, perſwaded
them they were near refreſhment,
when they were environed with their
chiefeſt calamities. Here you might
ſee <hi>Pamela</hi> with her Arms wreathed
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:153743:58"/>
about <hi>Muſidorus,</hi> as if ſhe intended
there ſhould be her reſt, till he had
granted her requeſt, &amp; her caſt-down
eyes and weepings that bedewed her
pure cheeks did witneſs her abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
ſorrow. But at laſt, wiping them
away, ſhe conteſted with <hi>Muſidorus</hi>
and her ſelf on this manner:</p>
            <p>Dear <hi>Muſidorus,</hi> do not part from
her to whom you have ſo often
plighted your faith. If you love me,
as you vow you do, why will you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
my preſence? oh do not break
my heart with your inconſtancie, nor
ſtain your other virtues with ſuch a
crime, as never can be waſht away;
therefore ſtay, or elſe confute me
with your reaſon, and then I ſhall
hate my paſſion, and contemn my ſelf,
for valuing my intereſt in your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
above the main treaſure, ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
by the heavenly and earthly
ſocietie, in keeping an honourable and
unblemiſhed reputation; which if you
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:153743:58"/>
can do, and yet leave me, I will never
ſhew my ſelf ſuch a ridiculous lover
as to be your hinderance. My thrice
dearer than my ſelf, replied <hi>Muſidorus,</hi>
do not afflict me with the word In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancie;
if I were guiltie, then
might you juſtly tax me with it. But
far be the thought of infidelitie from
me: and believe me Ladie, <hi>Plaxirtus</hi>
cannot pierce his ſword deeper into
my heart, than theſe ſharp words,
which proceeded from your ſweet lips
have done. But for my Combat in
<hi>Armenia,</hi> that is ſo neceſſarie, that
none can decide the Quarrel, unleſs it
be my Coſin <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and my ſelf, by
reaſon of <hi>Artaxia</hi> &amp; <hi>Plaxirtus</hi> thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for our lives, they will never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<hi>Erona</hi> to be releaſed from priſon,
before they have vented their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
upon us, in as great a meaſure
as their abilitie can give them leave.
And beſides, ſhould I refuſe, it would
redound ſo extreamly upon my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:153743:59"/>
that every one would be readie
to object, that ſince a Woman pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
over me, I am directly coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized.
And now, dear Ladie, I dare
preſume you will rather let me ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
my life in defence of ſo juſt a
cauſe, than to let it go unrevenged to
my deſerved infamie.</p>
            <p>Poor <hi>Pamela</hi> all this while ſeemed
like one in a trance, not having power
to contradict <hi>Muſidorus</hi> in his plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
nor yet able to ſubmit her yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them; but made her tears and
ſighs her advocates, when he with all
perſwaſions ſought to comfort her.
And in the mean time the ſweet <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loclea,</hi>
who lay grovelling at her <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocles</hi>
feet, and would not be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
expreſſed her grief in theſe
mournfull complaints.</p>
            <p>Ah me! ſaid ſhe, that I ſhould be
born under ſuch an unfortunate Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
of unhappie events that dayly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
me! tell me, my <hi>Pyrocles</hi> the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:153743:59"/>
cauſe that makes you ſo willingly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
your perſon in ſuch dangerous
attempts? if you can tax me with any
errors, to my ſelf unknown, that
might work your displeaſure, O tell
me what they are that I may mend,
and ſtudie ſome eaſier waw to puniſh
me than by your intended death. But
if nothing elſe may reconcile me to
you, yet ſhew your clemencie, and let
your own bleſſed hand firſt end my
miſerie.</p>
            <p>Here ſhe ſtopped, and perceiving
<hi>Pyrocles</hi> to be in as amazed condition
as ſhe her ſelf was, not knowing what
to do or ſay to appeaſe her ſorrow, ſhe
premeditated, that now or never was
her time to keep him with her in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and then ſhe ſuddenly aroſe from
the ground, and ſtanding a while in
great devotion, at laſt ſhe cried out;</p>
            <p>Now am I readie to receive thy
harmleſs Spear into my heart, now
ſhew thy love &amp; pitie to me quickly,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:153743:60"/>
and preſerve me not alive to endure
ſuch terrour as cannot be charmed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
unleſs you will promiſe me the
enjoyment of your companie. But
<hi>Pyrocles</hi> ſtarted up, and catching her
in his arms, adviced her not to give
way to ſorrow, the hater of Beautie,
to rule over her; nor yet to miſtruſt
ſhe ever offended him, but that ſhe
was more pretious to him than the
world could be; and that he made no
queſtion but that he ſhould return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
from <hi>Armenia</hi> to enjoy her with
peace and happineſs.</p>
            <p>With theſe and many more ſuch
expreſſions, he ſtrived to chear her up.
But ſhe ſtill kept on bewailing her ill
fortune, and would not be pacified:
untill <hi>Muſidorus</hi> came to her and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
her to go to her Siſter <hi>Pemela,</hi>
and to ſhew her discretion by mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
her paſſion, that ſhe might be
a motive to reduce her Siſter to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
her example, who now lay wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:153743:60"/>
in her tears. Theſe tidings per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
her to defer her own cares,
that ſhe might in ſome meaſure work
a cure in her ſiſter, whom ſhe valued,
next to her <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> above all the
world. And then ſhe would not delay
the time with bemoaning herſelf, but
haſtily went her way ſupported by the
two illuſtrious branches of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
<hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Muſidorus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as ſhe went there repreſented
to her view the two antient Kings,
<hi>Evarchus</hi> and <hi>Baſilius</hi> walking to and
fro like ſhadows, and looked as they
would have done, had one come out
of the Grave to warn them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
themſelves in ſhort time to come
to them. This doleful ſight had like
to have prevailed over her, and made
her fall into a Relapſe of paſſion; but
the rememberance of the task ſhe was
going about ſuppreſſed thoſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours.
And being come withi the ſight
of <hi>Pamela,</hi> whoſe deluge was ſtayd
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:153743:61"/>
a little to pauſe, that it might iſſue
more freſhly and eagerly at <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleas</hi>
preſence) whom as ſoon as ſhe
eſpied, ſhe perceived her hidden diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,
and rebuked one this manner.</p>
            <p>Siſter, think not your diſſembling
ſmiles can entiſe me to follow your
example, for I can as perfectly ſee
through you into your grieved heart,
as if you were transparent, and know
your pain that now you endeavour
to conceal. Oh! leave theſe counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits,
and you will be a farr more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
comforter unto me.</p>
            <p>Poor <hi>Philoclea</hi> could no longer
withſtand the batteries of <hi>Pamela,</hi> but
confeſſed her forced mirth, and then
inſtead of aſſwaging, they augmented
one anothers ſorrows with ſuch la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
moans, that <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and
<hi>Muſidorus</hi> were forced to give way to
Sighs, till their thoughts were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
by the coming of <hi>Clytifon,</hi> who
brought them word, that the two
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:153743:61"/>
Kings ſtayed at the door to ſpeak
with them. Then they ſoftly went out
of the Chamber, and were received
by <hi>Baſileus</hi> and <hi>Evarchus,</hi> who told
them, that ſince it ſtood ſo much upon
their Honours to endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
that diſtreſſed Ladie, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
them not to linger in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of it, for nothing was in their
way to cauſe any delay, and the ſooner
they went, the ſooner by <hi>Apollo</hi>'s aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
they might return: To whoſe
mercie they recommended them, and
commanded them, that when they
had obtained a proſperous journey,
and had vanquiſhed their enemies,
not to be negligent in ſending them
word of it, that they might be ſharers
in their joy as well as their ſorrow.
Then after both the Kings had made
them happie with their bleſſings, they
ſent them away.</p>
            <p>Though firſt <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Muſido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
would needs take a review of their
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:153743:62"/>
Ladies Pavilion, but not of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
out of conſideration that it
would but double their affliction: and
then reverencing the carpet on which
they uſed to tread, they took their
leave of the deſolate Chamber, and
did reſolve to travel alone. Had not
<hi>Kalodolus, Muſidoru's</hi> faithful Servant,
made a vow that no occaſions ſhould
perſwade him to leave his maſter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
ſo that <hi>Muſidorus,</hi> ſeeing there
was no remedie, yielded to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.
Nor could <hi>Amphialus</hi> noble
heart well brook to ſtay behind, for
oftentimes he entreated them that
he might go a ſecond for them, or
elſe a ſervant to them. But they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
him that he could not do
them better Service than to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
his Coſins, and make much of
them in their abſence: then, after they
had accompliſhed ſome more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements,
they parted, <hi>Amphialus</hi> to
his charge, and the Princes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:153743:62"/>
themſelves into the hands of
wavering Fortune. Who having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſhewed them her frowns, would
now pleaſure them with her ſmiles,
which firſt ſhe discovered by convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them ſafely to <hi>Armenia,</hi> where
they were wellcomed unanimoſly by
all, but eſpecially by <hi>Plangus,</hi> who
could hardly confine his joy within
the bounds of reaſon.</p>
            <p>But the Princes being mindfull of
his buſines, deſires <hi>Plangus</hi> to haſten
their Combat, becauſe their Ladies
were in a deſpairing condition of ever
ſeeing them again, and they aſſured
him they did not fear to enter within
the compaſs of <hi>Plaxirtus,</hi> ſo long as it
was by the publick agreement, and
not by ſecret practices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Plangus</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
them that all things were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for their accommodation, and
that they might, if they pleaſed, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
their valour upon their enemies
the next morning. And that two
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:153743:63"/>
Scaffolds were erected, the one for
<hi>Artaxia,</hi> ſhe intending to be a Behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
the other for <hi>Erona,</hi> who is to be
brought thither guarded as a Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and in her ſight there is a Stake in
readines to conſume her, if they be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome.
This laſt he uttered in ſuch
mournful expreſſions, that <hi>Pyrocles</hi>
and <hi>Muſidorus</hi> vowed to ſpend their
hearts bloud, but that they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe
&amp; deliver <hi>Erona</hi> from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of <hi>Artaxia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And before they would refreſh
themſelves with <hi>Plangus</hi> entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
they dispatched a Trumpeter
to <hi>Plexirtus</hi> and <hi>Anaxius</hi> to certifie
them, they were come to anſwer their
challenge, and had ſet apart the next
morning for that purpoſe: the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter
ſoon returned with this reply,
that the ſooner it was, the more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
it would prove to them,
and they would not fail to meet them
at the place and time appointed. Thus
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:153743:63"/>
they agreed upon the next morning;
and when the Prince had partaked of
<hi>Plangus</hi> Supper, they yielded to ſleep,
which forſook them not till the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
time was near at hand.</p>
            <p>Early in the morning <hi>Plaxirtus</hi> and
<hi>Anaxius</hi> puffed up with Pride; and
not queſtioning but that they ſhould
be Conquerours, put on their Armour,
and mounting their ſteeds, galloped
to the Liſt. And <hi>Artaxia,</hi> thinking to
vent her ſpleen with gazing at the
overthrow of the Princes, came to the
Scaffold attired in all her coſtly and
glorious apparel, and with as great
a Train as ſhe would have had, were
ſhe to have been ſpectator of her
Husbands Coronation, King of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Within awhile was <hi>Erona</hi> brought
guarded by a Band of Souldiers to
her Scaffold, where ſhe might ſee the
end of her miſerie by the Fire, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
by <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Muſidorus</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:153743:64"/>
victorie: but ſhe, being wearied out of
her life by ſundrie afflictions, looked
as gladly upon the fiery Stake, as ſhe
did upon her famous Champions
who were then entered the liſt, and
waving their ſwords about their
heads; <hi>Pyrocles</hi> encountred <hi>Anaxius</hi>
and <hi>Muſidorus Plaxirtus.</hi> Then enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
they into ſo fierce a fight, that it
goes beyond my memorie to declare
all the paſſages thereof: but both
Parties ſhewed ſuch magnanimity of
Courage, that for a long time none
could discern who ſhould be victors;
Till at length <hi>Muſidorus</hi> gave a fatal
thruſt to <hi>Plaxirtus,</hi> who being before
faint with loſs of bloud, fell from his
Steed, and in the fall claſht his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
in pieces; and then his Steed, for
joy that he was eaſed of ſuch a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
burden, pranced over his disgraced
maſter, and not ſuffering him to die
ſuch an honourable death as by <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidorus</hi>
Sword, trampled out his guts,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:153743:64"/>
while <hi>Plaxirtus,</hi> with curſes in his
mouth, ended his hateful life.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Pirocles</hi> redoubled his blows
ſo eagerly upon <hi>Anaxius,</hi> that he
could no longer withſtand them, but
gnaſhing his teeth for anger, he fell
at <hi>Pyrocles</hi> feet and died. Thus pride
and Treacherie received their juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>But then <hi>Artaxia</hi>'s glory was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into mourning, and her rich attire
into, rags as ſoon as ſhe perceived
<hi>Plaxirtus</hi> wounded, his bloud guſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out, his Horſe treading on him,
and he himſelf dying with bitter
groans and frantick ſpeeches, which
he breathed out at his laſt moment
for fear of further torments: ſhe tare
off her hair, and rent her cloths in ſo
enraged a manner, that ſhe drew all
eyes from the corps in wonder and
amaſement on her. Nor could any
thing regulate her furie, but ſhe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently
run down to the corps, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:153743:65"/>
there breathed out her complaints.</p>
            <p>In which time <hi>Plangus</hi> called his
Souldiers together, and went up to
the other ſcaffold to releaſe <hi>Erona;</hi>
though at firſt he was forced to make
a way with his ſword, the Guard re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
not to ſurrender her, till they
had received a further command
from <hi>Artaxia:</hi> but <hi>Plangus</hi> made
them repent their ſtrictneſs, and ask
<hi>Erona</hi> pardon for it. And after he
was revived with a warm kiſs from
her hand, he led her down to <hi>Pyrocles</hi>
and <hi>Muſidorus:</hi> Who having forgot
the former injuries <hi>Artaxia</hi> had done
them, courteouſly perſwaded her not
to bemoan him, whoſe memorie was
reprochfull to all the world, for valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his one deceitfulneſs above virtue;
and then they told her, it would be
more for her renown, to ſolemnize
for him ſuch obſequies as are ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for a Prince, he being of the race,
although he learned not to follow
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:153743:65"/>
their example; and then to proclaim
her ſorrow for joyning with him in
his miſchief. Many more ſpeeches
they uſed to her, ſome to abate her
grief, &amp; others to aſſwage her malice;
but at firſt ſhe would liſten to none;
yet afterwards being better adviſed,
ſhe ſent for two magnificent Hearſes,
and before ſhe would ſuffer <hi>Plaxirtus</hi>
his corps to be laid in, ſhe pronounced
her reſolution on this manner:</p>
            <p>Since it hath pleaſed <hi>Apollo,</hi> who
hath the Government of all things
on earth, to ſuffer <hi>Plaxirtus</hi> to fall by
your proweſs, I do here by this dead
bodie vow to you, to end my life in
Widowhood. And you Coſin <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi>
whom I have ſo infinitely wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with this fair Ladie <hi>Erona,</hi> to you
I do reſign up the Authoritie of my
Kingdom, being, after my deceaſe, the
lawfull Succeſſour. I ſhall deſire one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a competencie to keep me from fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhment:
but if theſe your valiant
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:153743:66"/>
Champions will have you go to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia,</hi>
to finiſh your Marriage there,
in that time I will be your truſtie De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie,
to order your affairs here in
<hi>Armenia,</hi> until you return from
thence. Then ſhe commanded the
corps to be laid in the Hearſe, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
leave of the Royal companie, ſhe
went along with it.</p>
            <p>Now the Princes had time to take
notice of <hi>Erona</hi>'s ſadneſs. And <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi>
who had been all this time court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her to be his Miſtreſs, could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
no favour from her, but far-fetcht
ſighs, and now and then Chryſtal
drops diſtilling from their fountains.
Theſe apparent ſigns of her disconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
mind, grounded a great deal of
cares in the hearts of the Princes, who
bending all their endeavours to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
<hi>Plangus</hi> into her affections, they
firſt ſifted her with theſe Queſtions;
Whether her being preſerved from
the crueltie of <hi>Plaxirtus,</hi> was the cauſe
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:153743:66"/>
of her discontentment? or whether,
ſhe grieved for her deliverance? and
therefore hated them for fighting in
her defence? Theſe Queſtions put
<hi>Erona</hi> into ſuch Quondaries, that ſhe
could not, for a while, determin what
to anſwer. But at laſt ſhe pitcht upon
true ſinceritie, and freely diſplayed her
griefs to them, in theſe terms:</p>
            <p>Do not, I beſeech you, plead igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of that which is ſo palpable.
Have you not heard how they tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
my Husband <hi>Antifalus</hi> to death?
why then do you renew it in my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie?
which might have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
if you, Prince <hi>Plangus,</hi> had
ſhewed your realitie to me, as
you proteſted you would by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie
ſet him at liberty, but all
was neglected and <hi>Antifalus</hi> was
barbarouſly murdered, and yet you
are not aſhamed to preſume up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my weakneſs, in pretending you
are my Servant, that you may the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:153743:67"/>
ſecond time deceive me. Longer ſhe
would have chidden <hi>Plangus;</hi> but
that he falling down humbly begged
ſhe would have conſideration upon
him, and heare him. Then with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
ſhe admitted him, and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
how that according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
made to her Sacred ſelf, he did
proſecute ſo faithfully, that he
brought all things to a readineſs, and
might have been perfected, but that
the timorous <hi>Antifalus</hi> discovered
the whole Plot the ſame night it was
to be put in execution. And this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ſcruple, he would take his
oath was true. <hi>Erona</hi> conſidered very
much of this ſaying of <hi>Plangus:</hi> and
<hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Muſidorus</hi> watching their
opportunity, juſt as ſhe was replying,
interrupted her, and told her they
were confident ſhe might give credit
to what <hi>Plangus</hi> had ſpoken; and if
ſhe durſt rely upon their advice, they
would recommend him to her for
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:153743:67"/>
her Husband, as ſoon as the greateſt
Monarch in the world. Theſe Princes
ſeconding <hi>Plangus</hi> in his excuſes,
mitigated <hi>Erona's</hi> penſivenes, ſo that
cheerfully ſhe yielded her ſelf to be
at <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Muſidorus</hi> dispoſing:
for, ſaid ſhe, I am bound by ſo many
Obligations to you, that I cannot
ſuffer my requitall to be a refuſall.
Onely I deſire that Prince <hi>Plangus</hi>
may approve the truth of his words
with an Oath, as he himſelf hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.
Which he willingly did
upon that condition, and ſhe accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of him as her betrothed Husband.
And Cupid by degrees ſo skill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
drew her affection to him, that
ſhe was as firmly <hi>Planguses,</hi> as ever
ſhe was <hi>Antifaluses</hi> to the abundant
joy of all their friends.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Muſidorus</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
being in every particular
accompliſhed as well as could be
wiſhed, They remembring the charge
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:153743:68"/>
of <hi>Evarchus</hi> to them; together with
the cares of their ſorrowfull Ladies,
they preſently ſent a Poſt to <hi>Arcadia</hi>
to ſignifie the news of their ſafety:
but yet there remained the care of
diſpatching their Armie into their
native Countrey <hi>Macedon.</hi> And as
they were conferring which way they
might compaſs that matter of ſuch
conſequence quickly, <hi>Kalodolus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the counſel put in his verdict,
which was liked very well, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
put in practice; for he having
a ſpecial friend in whom he very
much confided, he adviſed that he
might be truſted to be General in
<hi>Plangus</hi> room, that they might or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
go home, and after they were
payd their due, to dismiſs them and
let them go to their own Houſes.</p>
            <p>When all this was performed: they
commanded all conveniences to be
prepared for their own accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
about their return to <hi>Arcadia;</hi>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:153743:68"/>
but for curioſities they would not
ſtay for them, but limited a day for
their departure. In which time <hi>Erona</hi>
imployed her inventions about a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
for <hi>Pamela</hi> and <hi>Philoclea,</hi> which
ſhe was verie ambitious of, they being
the miſtreſſes of <hi>Muſidorus</hi> and <hi>Pyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
to whom ſhe acknowledged her
ſelf infinitely engaged; and without
delayance, ſhe ſet all her Maids to
work the Story of their love, from the
fountain to the happy concluſion:
which by her buſie fancie ſhe ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo artificially, that when it was
perfected, and ſhe had ſhewed it to
the Princes, they vowed that had
they not known by experience thoſe
paſſages to have been gone and paſt,
they ſhould have believed they were
then in acting in that piece of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip.</p>
            <p>Now all the work was ended, their
neceſſaries were in a readineſs, fair
and temperate weather beſpake their
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:153743:69"/>
fuller happineſs. All theſe ſo well
concurring, enticed the Princes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
their journey. And Fortune, deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
favourably, conducted them ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and ſpeedily to the <hi>Arcadian</hi>
Court. Where they were received
with ſuch joy by their Conſorts, and
Parents eſpecially, and by all in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
as it would make two large a
ſtorie to recount all their diſcourſes,
with their affectionate expreſſions
that paſſed between the Royal lovers.
Paſſing by all other, give me leave
to tell you, it was a prettie ſight to
ſee the four Ladies, <hi>Pamela</hi> and
<hi>Philoclea,</hi> with <hi>Helena</hi> and <hi>Erona,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
one anothers perfections, all
of them having the worſt opinions
of themſelves, and the better of their
neighbours. Therefore to decide the
controverſie, <hi>Philoclea</hi> entreated her
<hi>Pyrocles,</hi> to make a motion to <hi>Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doru's,
Plangus,</hi> and <hi>Amphialus</hi> to
ſpend their judgements upon them.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:153743:69"/>
               <hi>Pyrocles</hi> immediately obeyed her; but
eſteemed beſt of their own miſtreſſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pyrocles</hi> liked <hi>Philoclea</hi> beſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
her ſparkling eyes, pure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plection,
and ſweet features were
crowned with ſuch modeſt courteſie,
that ſhe raviſhed all her Beholders,
and perſwaded them they were in
Paradiſe, when they were in her hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Angel-like companie, Earth not
affording her fellow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Muſidorus</hi> avouched, his fair <hi>Pamela</hi>
was always clad with ſuch a Majeſtie,
as beſpake her a Queen in ſpite of the
Deſtines; yet that Majeſtie was ſo
well compoſed with Humility, that
it ſeemed but an out caſe to a more
excellent inward virtue.</p>
            <p>Then came <hi>Plangu's</hi> turn, who
ſaid that in his judgement, <hi>Erona</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
to be extolled in the higheſt
meaſure, for though her ſplendor was
ſomething darkened by her ſadneſs
and ſufferings, yet under that veil her
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:153743:70"/>
brightneſs did appear to ſhoot forth
beams of goodneſs to every one that
did approch her Preſence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amphialus</hi> was laſt, who proteſted
there could not be a lovelier creature
than <hi>Helena</hi> was, ſo adorned with all
gifts of Nature, that he verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
if ſhe had tempted <hi>Adonis,</hi> as
<hi>Venus</hi> did, he could not in the leaſt
have denied her. And he aſſured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that by the determination of the
Gods, they being in love with her
themſelves, <hi>Cupid</hi> had ſtrook him
blind, that in the mean time they
might purſue their love; but ſeeing
ſhe was reſolved to accept of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
but him, they for pitie ſake
opened his eyes: and now he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed
at his former perverſeneſs.
This conceipt of <hi>Amphialus</hi> made the
Ladies exceeding merrie. Till <hi>Evar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
came to them and ſpake thus:</p>
            <p>Young Princes, I came now to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber
you how often you have been
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:153743:70"/>
by ſeveral accidents, fruſtrated of your
deſired Felicity: you ſee a little blaſt
alters your happineſs into a world of
ſorrows. Therefore harken to my
counſel, whoſe gray hairs witneſs my
better experience of the world than
your green years. Do not linger away
the time in Courtſhip: that is as bad
as to be careleſly raſh. Finiſh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the knot, that no croſſes or cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
can unfiniſh, without further
deferrings.</p>
            <p>This command of <hi>Evarchus,</hi> did
not at all displeaſe the four Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grooms.
Nothing hindered now but
their agreeing about the day; and that
made no long diſputation neither, for
two days following happened to be
<hi>Pamela</hi>'s. Birth-day, and that they
concluded ſhould be the Bridal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</p>
            <p>Now the night before theſe happy
Nuptials, <hi>Erona</hi> preſented <hi>Pamela</hi>
and <hi>Phyloclea</hi> with her rare piece of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:153743:71"/>
work, which they received with
thanks and admiration; and for the
honour of <hi>Erona</hi> (ſhe being the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor
of it) they cauſed it to be hung
up by the Image of <hi>Cupid</hi> in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and after paſſed the night in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs.</p>
            <p>Early in the morning the Sun ſhot
forth his glorious beams, and awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the lovers. But when they were
up, he hid himſelf a while within the
waterie clouds, weeping that they
were brighter Suns than he: yet when
they were gaurded with their nuptial
Robes, he diſperſed the clouds again,
and cleared his eyes, that he might
with envie gaze upon their luſtre;
and the Brides without diſdain yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their beauties to his peruſal. When
the Middle-day had almoſt run his
courſe to the After-noon, the four
Bride-grooms imitating one another
in their Apparel, were all in gray
cloth embroydered with gold, richly
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:153743:71"/>
clad, yet not fantaſtick; in their left
hands they held their ſwords, but in
their right their Brides.</p>
            <p>Firſt went <hi>Muſidorus</hi> leading his
fair Princeſs <hi>Pamela,</hi> whoſe comely
behaviour and ſweet ſympathie, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
her joy, that then <hi>Muſidorus</hi>
and ſhe ſhould be ſo united to live
and die together. Upon her head ſhe
bare an imperial Diadem, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
comparatively to her ſtately
mind. Her Garments were cloth of
Tiſſue, that in a careleſs faſhion hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
looſe about her. And round her
Neck ſhe wore a Chain of Orient
Pearl. Upon her Alabaſter ſhoulders
a blue Scarf was caſt, that being
whirled ſometimes with the wind, did
ſeem to blow her to <hi>Hymens</hi> Temple.
Six virgin Nimphs attired in White
attended on her. The two foremoſt
perfumed the ayr as they went with
their odiferous ſweets; but that was
ſuperfluous, for <hi>Pamela</hi>'s breath left
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:153743:72"/>
a far more fragrant ſcent than the
artificial curioſities could do; next to
them followed two other Virgins
with Holie-water in their hands,
which they ſprinkled as they went, to
purifie all ſinfull vapors; but that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
was needleſs, for no harm durſt
come near the Virtuous <hi>Pamela,</hi>
whoſe looks could charm even wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Fiends: then the two laſt follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Pamela,</hi> bearing up her train. Thus
was ſhe guarded to the Temple with
her beloved <hi>Muſidorus;</hi> and after them
went <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Philoclea, Plangus</hi>
and his <hi>Erona,</hi> and <hi>Amphialus</hi> with his
<hi>Helena,</hi> all in the ſame order as <hi>Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi>
and <hi>Pamela:</hi> then the Prieſt u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
their hands, and as their hands,
ſo their hearts together; and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
crueltie of <hi>Fortune</hi> was ever after
turned into pitie.</p>
            <p>The Temple where theſe Nuptial
Rites were thus celebrated, was ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
in a garden, or rather a Paradiſe
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:153743:72"/>
for its delightfulneſs; the murmuring
of the waters that flowed from a
Fonntain at firſt entrance dividing,
themſelves into four ſtreams, ſeeming
to threaten, and yet enticing the
comers to venter further; the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
bedecked with the Images of
<hi>Diana</hi> and her Maids, the Goddeſs
figured with an auſtere countenance,
pointing to the luſt-full <hi>Venus,</hi> whoſe
Statue at a little diſtance ſtood, as ſhe
with lacivious actions endeavored to
entrap the modeſt Boy <hi>Adonis,</hi> but
<hi>Hymen</hi> on the other ſide diſputes,
thoſe whom his Prieſts unite, cannot
be ſtiled <hi>Venu's,</hi> but <hi>Diana</hi>'s. The
perfumed flowers grew ſo thick in the
direct way to the Temple, that they
ſerved for Carpets to conſecrate the
Mortals feet before they approch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into it: the Temple was built of
Marble; the out-ſides adorned with
Portratures of the Gods. <hi>Fortune</hi> was
ſeated at the frontier of it, which at
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:153743:73"/>
the leaſt motion of the beholder, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
a ſeveral geſture. And all
the Gods, in their degrees, ſat preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
to the obſervers.</p>
            <p>The inſide was not ſo uniform as
artificial, it winding into ſeveral cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
in the paſſage to the ſacred place:
and all the way were emblems in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
of the calamities of Lovers before
they can be ſet in <hi>Hymens</hi> Temple; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them repreſenting the Princes
ſufferings. The middle of the Temple
is not ſo gorgeous as decent, where
there met with the Princes, ſome of
<hi>Hymens</hi> Officers attired in white robes
trailing on the ground. Theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
the Bride-grooms with Swords
and Ballances, and their Brides with
Lawrel; &amp; when they had here ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a ſweet harmonie to <hi>Hymen,</hi> they
went back from the Temple to the
Court.</p>
            <p>Where you may conjecture with
what joy they were received by <hi>Evar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:153743:73"/>
Baſilius,</hi> and <hi>Genecia,</hi> they all
pouring out their bleſſings upon them.
Then paſſed they away the remainder
of the day with all ſorts of Muſick,
Dancing, and other varieties of mirth.</p>
            <p>Whilſt a famous Mask was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the greateſt glorie to the view
of the Princes, and an innumerable
companie of noble Perſonages: <hi>Mop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi>
ſole heir to <hi>Damatas,</hi> who was by
<hi>Baſilius</hi> favour, the Princeſs <hi>Pamela</hi>'s
Governour, when ſhe reſided in the
Lodge, went to <hi>Philoclea,</hi> and wrying
her neck one way and her mouth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſhe ſqueazed out theſe enſuing
words. Fair Princeſs, I intend not
to forget the promiſe you made me,
when I told you a part of a curious
tale, how you aſſured me your Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Gown, if I would afford to finiſh
my Storie on that welcom day: but
now the greateſt part of the day is run
away, and you are raiſed ſo high on
your tip-toes, that you do not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:153743:74"/>
me to be in your books, but
chooſe rather to gaze upon theſe
ſtrange ſights, than to remember me,
or your Gown. The ſweet <hi>Philoclea</hi>
could not forbear bluſhing to hear
<hi>Mopſa</hi> reprove her ſo ſharply; but to
make her ſilent for the preſent, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
her promiſe, and <hi>Mopſa</hi> very
impatiently ſtayed out the vaniſhing
of their Scenes; which when <hi>Philoclea</hi>
perceived, ſhe ſmilingly led <hi>Mopſa</hi> by
her hand into the middeſt of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
companie, where ſhe left her to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
her diſcretion; and withdrawing
at a diſtance from her, ſhe discovered
to her Paramour <hi>Pyrocles, Mopſa</hi>'s
ambition, who immediately cauſed all
noiſes to be huſhed, that he might
with the greater attention hearken to
<hi>Mopſa,</hi> and obſerve all her actions
though never ſo abſurd. But <hi>Mopſa</hi>
vallued not the laughter of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders,
her little apprehenſion had
alreadie ſeized on <hi>Philoclea</hi>'s glittering
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:153743:74"/>
Gown, and ſhe imagined it hung up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her mothie Karkaſs; and in that
firm perſwaſion ſhe ſtood looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her ſelf like a Peacock, untill <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocles</hi>
called to her, which made her
skip, and rub her eyes before ſhe
could diſcern her ſelf to be yet in her
ruſtie Feathers. Yet afterwards, play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with her hands, for the more
grace; ſhe brake forth into theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
words.</p>
            <p>It ſeemeth beſt to my liking to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe
the firſt part of my Storie in
brief, that ſo ye may the better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
the Latter. There was a King,
(the chiefeſt man in all his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey)
who had a prettie Daughter,
who as ſhe was ſitting at a window, a
ſprightlie Knight came to her, and
with his dilly Phraſes won her to be
his own, and ſtealing out of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Caſtle, with many honey kiſſes,
he conjured her not to enquire after
his name, for that the water-Nimphs
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:153743:75"/>
would then ſnatch him from her:
howbeit one time, in a darkſom wood,
her teeth were ſet ſo on edge, that ſhe
asked, and he preſently with a piteous
howling vaniſhed away. Then ſhe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſhe had endured ſuch hardſhip as
ſhe never had endured in all her life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
went back to one of her Ants,
who gave her a Nutt, charging her
not to open it before ſhe fell into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie;
from her, ſhe went to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Ant, and ſhe gave her another
Nut, counſelling her (ſaid <hi>Mopſa)</hi> in
the ſame words that her firſt Ant had
done before her, and ſo ſent her pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
But ſhe one day being as wearie
as my fathers black horſe is, when
he hath rode a good journey on him,
ſat her down upon a Mole-hil, and
making huge complaints for her mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
a griſly old woman came to her,
commanding her to open one of the
Nuts; and ſhe conſidering, that of a
little medling cometh great eaſe,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:153743:75"/>
broke it open, for nothing venter, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
have, which Proverb ſhe found
wondrous true; for within the ſhell
ſhe found a paper, which diſcovered
that her Knight was chained in an
ugly hole under ground in the ſame
wood where ſhe loſt him. But one
Swallow makes no ſummer; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhe cracked her other Nut, from
whence there flew out gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in ſuch abundance, that the old
Woman falling down upon her
ſtumps, ſcrambled up her lap full,
and yet left the joyfull maid her
load: Need makes the old wife trot;
nay, it made both the old and young
to trot, and to lug away their bags
of money: and when they came to a
lane with twentie ſeveral paths, the
old Woman took her leave of the
Kings dainty Daughter, bidding her
lay down the money, and it ſhould
guid her to her Knight: with that
ſhe laid it down, and the money tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:153743:76"/>
the direct way before her.</p>
            <p>At this paſſage <hi>Mopſa</hi> conceiting
that ſhe ſaw Mammons treaſure ſo
near her, opened her mouth, which
was of a ſufficient wideneſs, and wad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
along as if ſhe had been practizing
to catch flies there: which if ſhe had,
the priſoners might have recreated
their wings within their priſon walls;
they were ſo large. The princely So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie
could not forbear ſimparing at
<hi>Mopſa</hi>'s raviſhment, and had burſt out
into a publick mirth, had they not
been ſurprized with a better object.</p>
            <p>Which at firſt view appeared to be
the Goddeſs <hi>Flora</hi> and her Nymphs,
their addorning imitating hers, but
when they drew near, they diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their errors, it being <hi>Urania,</hi> a fair
Shepherdeſs, who might be very well
taken for <hi>Flora;</hi> for although it was
impoſſible for her to excel the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs
in beautie, yet without controle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in <hi>Pamela</hi>'s and <hi>Philoclea</hi>'s ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:153743:76"/>
ſhe might paralel the moſt tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent:
on either ſide of this <hi>Ura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
there walked the two Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,
<hi>Strephon</hi> and <hi>Claius,</hi> with their
eyes fixed on her in celeſtial admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
their countenances reſembled
deſpair more than hope, and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
more than confidence: theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
themſelves unto the Princeſs,
leaving the prettie Sheperdeſs at a
ſhort diſtance with her companions,
who in Troops attended her; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating
themſelves at their feet, they
burſt out into bitter tears.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Muſidorus,</hi> who was then raiſed to
the height of temporal bleſſings, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
not to acknowledge them to
have been the Founders of his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
repeating in publick, how they
had preſerved him from the dangers
of the Seas: but <hi>Claius</hi> and <hi>Strephon</hi>
could not ſuborn their weepings, but
continued weltring in their tears,
which aſtoniſhed and ſtrook a ſadneſs
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:153743:77"/>
into the leaſt relenting ſpirits; all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ignorant of the Accident, except
<hi>Muſidorus,</hi> who ſurmized the truth.</p>
            <p>Now whilſt they expected the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue,
<hi>Mopſa</hi> laid hold on <hi>Philoclea,</hi> and
with many a vineger look, beſought
her to hear out her Tale: and for fear
ſhe ſhould be deprived of her Gown,
without depending on a replie, ſhe
purſued her Storie in theſe her accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
expreſſions. Leading her, ſaid
<hi>Mopſa,</hi> to the very Caves mouth,
where her Knight vented a thouſand
grievous groans, then in her hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſhe might then joyfully ſing, faſt
bind, faſt find, for there the Witches
bound him, and there his Sweet-heart
found him, where they pleaſured one
another with their ſugar-kiſſes; and
after a good while, ſhe unchained him,
and then they lovingly ſet them
down and ſlept all night in the
Cave, becauſe haſte maketh waſte;
but the next morning, ſhe ſhewed
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:153743:77"/>
him her monſtrous vaſt ſums of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
which ſo affrighted him, that he
clinging his eyes faſt together, was
not able to ſay, Both to a Gooſe hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie:
yet at laſt ſhe perſwaded him, and
he peeped up, and waxed the merrieſt
man upon earth when he had got
himſelf free, and his Miſtreſs again
with ſuch ſtore of Riches: for then
the old woman, that had adviſed
the Kings Daughter to open her
nuts, and to lay down the money, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to him, and releaſed him of
his Bondage by Witchcraft, for ever
after: wherefore the Knight, and his
own ſweet darling went back to the
Kings Court, as jocundly as could
be, and with ſome of their money
they bought them a brave Coach
and Horſes, juſt ſuch as are in my
fathers ſtable at home, and in ſuch
pomp they went to the King their
Father, who entertained them brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
pleaſing them with delicate
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:153743:78"/>
ſights, as Puppet-plaies, and ſtately
Fairs; and their riches encreaſed dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and they lived gallantly, as long
as they had a jot of breath in their
bodies.</p>
            <p>Thus finiſhed <hi>Mopſa</hi> her tedious
Tale, which though it was very ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
yet wanted it not applauſes
from all the Auditors: and <hi>Philoclea</hi>
in requital, preſented her with her
Bridal Roabs, telling her, ſhe deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
larger incouragements to elevate
her wit; and more ſpeeches ſhe uſed
in <hi>Mopſa</hi>'s commendation, whoſe
partial ſenſes were ſubject to believe
all ſuch rare realities; in which blind
opinion I will leave her;</p>
            <p>To return to the disconſolate
Shepherds <hi>Claius</hi> and <hi>Strephon,</hi> who
when they had wept their paſſionate
Fountains drie, they looked about
with adoration upon the prettie <hi>Ura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
as the reviver of their languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hopes, and <hi>Strephon</hi> yielding to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:153743:78"/>
               <hi>Claius</hi> the preheminence by reaſon of
his years, he with great reverence to
<hi>Baſilius</hi> with the Bride-grooms and
Brides,</p>
            <p>Thus ſpake; Dread Soveraign, and
moſt Illuſtrious Princes, we beſeech
you not to reckon it among the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of miſdemeanors, that we ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
the brightneſs of this Nuptial
day with our clowdie Fortunes, ſince
our aim is to diſperſe our envious
miſts, and to make it the more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
by celebrating a Feaſt; and
though our triumph cannot amount
to ſuch ſplendor as the four great
Monarchs doth, whoſe flouriſhing
Dominions can onely ſatisfie their
gladneſs by their Princes pomp; yet
harbour the belief (pardon me if I
ſay amiſs) that our Bride may equal
yours in Beautie, though not in rich
attire, and in noble virtues, though
not in Courtly accoutrements; her
Soul, the Impartial Diadem of her
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:153743:79"/>
delicate Bodie, is certainly incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to all other of her ſex, though
heavenly. This Miſtreſs of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
is <hi>Urania</hi> the Shepherdeſs, ſhe
it is that cauſes my eyes to ebb and
flow, my joynts to tremble at her
looks, and my ſelf to periſh at her
frowns; but I will not inſiſt too much
(upon your Highneſs patience) on this
Subject, her ſelf is an evident witneſs
of all, and more than I have Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctered:
and Gracious Sirs, as I am
bound by all dutie and Allegiance to
live under the ſervitude of my Lord
<hi>Baſilius,</hi> as well as under his protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
ſo am I not confin'd from grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
to ſuch as will obliege me in
this my proſtrate condition, or in any
extremitie; for the Deſtinies have
allotted ſuch cruel Fates to my
Friend <hi>Claius</hi> and me, whoſe entire
affections are never to be ſevered, that
we both are ſlaves to <hi>Urania</hi>'s pierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Eyes! Oh we both are vaſſals to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:153743:79"/>
her devoted graces; yet ſo much do
we eſteem of our unfeigned Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
that we will rather abandon all
happineſs, than to cauſe a discontent,
or ſuſpition of our real wiſhes of one
anothers proſperitie; out of which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
we ſubmit to be ruled by the
judgement of you, renowned Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grooms,
whoſe prudence and juſtice is
not to be ſwayed by any partialitie; to
you it is that we do humbly petition,
to diſtinguiſh which of us two may
beſt deſerve to be admitted into <hi>Ura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>'s
ſpotleſs thoughts, as her lawfull
Husband.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Claius</hi> had not ceaſed his ſuit ſo
ſuddenly, but that <hi>Strephon</hi> interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him thus abruptly:</p>
            <p>Good <hi>Claius,</hi> bar the paſſage of thy
tongue, and grant me libertie to ſpeak
and eaſe my fierce torment: the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
I bear to your age, and my ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie
to your perſon, permitted you
to disburden your fancie firſt, but not
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:153743:80"/>
to deprive me of the ſame priviledge.
Know then, moſt excellent Princes,
that this incomparable <hi>Urania,</hi> (O her
virtues cannot be expreſſed by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
creatures! for at the very menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning
of her name my tongue faltered,
and my ſelf condemns my ſelf for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too preſumptuous, but yet this
once we ſtrive againſt her powers that
thus poſſeſſes me, and will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
from telling you that) ſhe is
compounded ſo artificially, as ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be paralleld nor deſcribed; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, ſhe is above the capacitie of
the moſt ſtudious Philoſopher: and do
not harbour, I beſeech you, a prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
opinion of her, under the notion
of her entertaining two lovers at one
inſtant, ſince it hath been always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to her chaſt diſpoſition, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of the leaſt motion concerning a
married life; and for Platonick Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
her heavenly modeſtie is a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
witneſs of her innocencie. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:153743:80"/>
the many dolorous hours that
my friend <hi>Claius</hi> and I have paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
our onely recreation we enjoyed
being in recounting the careleſs acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſhe uſed when we declared our
paſſions, and commending our choice
though ſhe was cruel. But when this
your happie day was prefixed, ſhe ſhot
forth beams of goodneſs on us, and
in charitie ſhe concluded, that her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
were far from our deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and ſince now ſhe perceived our
lives were in jeopardie, and we depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
onely upon her reply, ſhe would no
longer keep us in ſuſpence, but was
reſolved her Nuptials ſhould be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized
on this day, following the
example of the two Royal Siſters
whom ſhe ever adored. And becauſe
ſhe would not be an inſtrument to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
that knot of Friendſhip between
<hi>Claius</hi> and me, ſhe referred her choice
to your wiſdoms, worthie Sirs, the
excellent Siſters Bride-grooms, you it
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:153743:81"/>
is whom ſhe deſires to pronounce ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
my felicitie, or my overthrow.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Strephon,</hi> cloſing his ſpeech
with an innumerable companie of
long-fetcht ſighs, departed to his
Goddeſs <hi>Urania,</hi> who was environed
by her fellow Shepherdeſſes, which in
admiration, love, or envie ſtood gazing
on her; but he preſſed through the
thickeſt of them to do homage to her
ſweet ſelf, ſhe looking on him careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
without either reſpecting or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining
him.</p>
            <p>But aged <hi>Claius</hi> had caſt himſelf at
the Princes feet, where he pleaded for
his own felicitie on this manner;</p>
            <p>Conſider my ancient years, and in
compaſſion think how eaſily grief may
cut off the term of my life; when
youthfull <hi>Strephon</hi> may baffle with
Love, and Court ſome other Dame,
Ile finde him one who ſhal be as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to his eyes, as <hi>Urania</hi> is in mine;
unleſs the fates have raiſed him to be
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:153743:81"/>
my victorious Rival. But alas, O tell
me <hi>Strephon!</hi> did I ever injure thee,
that thou ſeekeſt my untimely death?
haſt not thou ever been in my ſight
as a jewel of an unvalued rate? why
doſt thou then recompenſe me ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly?
I know thou wilt argue, that
the paſſion of Love with a Woman,
and with ſuch an one as <hi>Urania</hi> is, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be contradicted by the neareſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.
But I pray thee <hi>Strephon,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
the importunities of me, thy Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-friend,
regulate, nay aſſwage thy
paſſions, to keep me from periſhing?
Now <hi>Strephon,</hi> when he had revived
his drooping heart, with peruſing the
delicate <hi>Urania,</hi> and fearing that <hi>Clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
was ſupplicating to <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and
<hi>Muſidorus</hi> for her, he returned back,
happening to come at the minute
when <hi>Claius</hi> queſtioned him; to whom
he thus replied: What the Gods
have appointed, cannot be prevented,
nor quenched by the powerfulleſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:153743:82"/>
of any Mortal: and let that
ſuffice. <hi>Claius</hi> being ſo fully anſwered
to his conjecture, reſted ſilent to hear
his ſentence. <hi>Strephon,</hi> who was of a
more ſprightly conſtitution, recreated
himſelf ſometimes with gloſing upon
<hi>Urania,</hi> and then to obſerve the looks
of the Princes as they were conferring
together, about what to determin on
concerning them. Beſides his Paſtoral
ſongs that he ſounded in <hi>Urania</hi>'s
praiſe.</p>
            <p>But the Princes, who were then in
ſerious conſultation, liſtened to <hi>Baſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
who adviſed them in this manner:</p>
            <p>Deſpiſe not <hi>Claius</hi> his complaints,
though he be afflicted with the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of old age; youthfull <hi>Strephon</hi>
may ſeem more real and pleaſing to
the eye, yet <hi>Claius</hi> his heart, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
is the firmeſt ſettled; Youth is
wavering, Age is conſtant; Youth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires
Novelties, Age Antiquities:
<hi>Claius</hi> hath learned experience by age
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:153743:82"/>
to delight <hi>Urania</hi> with ſuch fancies
as may be ſuitable to her dispoſition;
<hi>Strephon's</hi> tender years cannot attain
to any knowledge, but as his own Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
leads him. Wherefore conſider
before you denounce your Sentence,
whether <hi>Urania</hi> may not be <hi>Claiu's</hi>
Spouſe better than <hi>Strephon</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pyrocles</hi> knowing that <hi>Baſiliu's</hi> aim
was to plead in defence of Dotage,
refrained to make any other reply
than, What you command Sir, we
muſt and will obey. For as he was
both by Birth and Education a Prince,
ſo had he not neglected to be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the dutie of a Subject. Not
that he was forced to acknowledge it
to <hi>Baſiliu's</hi> as his due, any otherwiſe
then as his goodneſs enduced him
to; that he might be a pattern to draw
the <hi>Arcadians</hi> to follow his example,
they wholly determining to be ruled
that day by <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Muſidorus,</hi>
who after <hi>Baſiliu's</hi> deceaſe was to be
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:153743:83"/>
their ſucceſſive King. And they were
not ignorant of the intimacie between
his Coſen <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they reverenced and obſerved
both their actions. But the Princes
<hi>Muſidorus</hi> and <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> to avoid the
rumours of the People that throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about them, to over-hear their
reſolution concerning the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,
retired to an Arbour-walk,
where none but the ſweet ſocietie of
Birds attented them: there <hi>Pyrocles</hi>
ripped open his ſuppoſition to <hi>Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,</hi>
which was to this effect.</p>
            <p>My dear Coſen, ſaid he, for of that
honoured Title my memorie ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be fruſtrated, doſt thou not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<hi>Baſilius</hi> guiltineſs, when he pleads
for dotage ſo extreamly? he hath not
unburdened his conſcience yet of his
amorouſneſs of me in my Amazons
Metamorphoſis: I know it ſtings
him by the Arguments he ſupports.
However he may ceaſe his fears of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:153743:83"/>
my discovering his courtſhip, for I
have always perſevered in Allegiance
and dutie to my Father, my King;
nor do I doubt my failing now in
thoſe Principles, ſince I have you my
worthie Coſen ſo near me. <hi>Muſidorus</hi>
embracing his Coſen, proteſted that
he harboured the ſame fancie, and ſaid
he, the ſtammering of his words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
the certainty: but did you not
admire the heavenly behaviour of my
<hi>Pamela</hi> to day, when ſhe aſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Temple, how her ſoul ſeemed
to flie with her body to that ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
place, as transported with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
into ſo holy an Habitation
which was too ſacred for any other
but her ſelf. And replyed <hi>Pyrocles,
Philoclea</hi> might be admitted with her,
whoſe Humility did ſeem to guard
her, or elſe ſure ſhe had ſtumbled; ſo
lightly did ſhe ſet her feet upon the
Pavement, leſt ſhe ſhould profane
it. And ſometimes dropping Agonies
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:153743:84"/>
did ſo ſurprize her, that ſhe ſeemed
to contemplate with divine myſterie;
and then to look down upon her
own unworthineſs with ſuch hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs
as made her moſt into tears,
as it were for ſoaring above her ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Whilſt the Princes were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing
in commendations of their
Brides.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Claius</hi> in the preſence of <hi>Baſilius</hi>
and the remaining Princes, fell down
and fainted. <hi>Strephon</hi> ſtood thumping
his breaſt, and crying, O <hi>Muſidorus!</hi>
think upon us who ſuccoured you,
and let not a third Rival deprive us
of the incomparable <hi>Urania.</hi> This
unexpected paſſion of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd's,
aſtoniſhed the ſenſes of all
the beholders: yet none were ſo ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
as to neglect their ſerviceable
care: yea <hi>Urania</hi> her ſelf, though
juſt before when <hi>Pamela</hi> and <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea</hi>
ſent and entreated her company,
ſhe had returned a modeſt refuſal; yet
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:153743:84"/>
now perceiving <hi>Strephon</hi>'s and <hi>Claiu</hi>'s
diſtreſs, ſhe tarried not to hear the
news by Harbingers, but went the
foremoſt to relieve them: upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
<hi>Strephon</hi> ſhe ſmiled, ſaying,
Is <hi>Fortune</hi> thine enemie <hi>Strephon?</hi> but
her voice ſounded ſo harmoniouſly
in his ears, that he disclaimed all ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
promiſing himſelf the victorie.
She then abſented from him, that ſhe
might work as effectual and ſudden
a cure upon aged <hi>Claius,</hi> who gaſtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lay foaming on the ground, yet
that terrible ſight was not ſo obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to her as to overſway her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
ſhe pinched and pulled him,
endeavouring to reſtore his life again;
but nothing would recover him, until
ſhe breathed on him with ſtooping
near him, and pronouncing theſe
words:</p>
            <p>Unhappie <hi>Claius,</hi> whoſe life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon a woman! this once look
up, &amp; ſpeak me blameleſs. Have not I
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:153743:85"/>
ever abhord the thought of <hi>Strephons</hi>
or your ruins? yes ſure, I have, &amp; have
dallied with you both, apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
eithers danger, if I ſhould forſake
one, and reſign my ſelf up to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
diſpoſal; neither have I regarded
the piping of the Shepherds, nor the
ſongs of the Shepherdeſſes: and on
Feſtival days, when they have elected
me Queen of their Triumphs, I have
excuſed my ſelf, and retired into ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie
Groves, where I have ſpent the
day in muſing upon my Lovers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate
conditions, and ſtudying for
the probableſt Antidotes that might
cure their diſtempers, without ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhing
mine own reputation. But
that was ſo hard a task, that I could
never accompliſh it. <hi>Claius</hi> age could
not endure ſuch a penaltie as my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
without miſcarriage: and <hi>Stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi>'s
working brain would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it without practicing a Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
upon himſelf. Wherefore I made
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:153743:85"/>
patience my friend, and coyneſs my
favourite, neither ſlighting, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming
their large alluſious of my
Beautie and their Paſſion, which they
oft repeated, until the reports of
the conſummating of the Princeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
Nuptials were confirmed. And
then I reſolved, that as I abhorred
murder, ſo I would no longer admit
them into my companie, before the
Prieſt of <hi>Pan</hi> hath united me to one
of them, that then I might without
derogating from my honour, by cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious
ſuſpitions, enjoy the ſocietie
of him whom the Princes ſhall ſelect
to be my wedded Husband. So in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
is my choice of theſe two
conſtant Friends, and unmoveable
Servants.</p>
            <p>Before <hi>Urania</hi> had finiſhed theſe
words, <hi>Claius</hi> in a rapture of joy, rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
up his drowned ſpirits. And then
<hi>Urania</hi> retired back to her fellow
Sheperdeſſes; but the Princes were
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:153743:86"/>
ſo inquiſitive to know what acccident
had brought <hi>Claius</hi> and <hi>Strephon</hi> into
ſuch deſpairing Agonies, that they
would not permit them to tender
their ſervice to <hi>Urania</hi> at her preſent
departure, for deſire of queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning
them. <hi>Strephon</hi> made this
quick replie; that a ſtranger preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to gaze upon <hi>Urania;</hi> and his
feet going as nimblie as his tongue,
he tripped after her, not asking leave
of the concours of People that
thronged about him.</p>
            <p>But aged <hi>Claius,</hi> whoſe tongue
was livelier than his feet, ſpake after
this manner:</p>
            <p>My greedie eyes, ſaid he, being
dazled with looking too long upon
<hi>Urania,</hi> who is adorned with as glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
beams as <hi>Phoebus</hi> can boaſt in
his brighteſt day; I yielded them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite,
giving them leave to take a
view of mortals, clearing their dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
with their equal light; but there
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:153743:86"/>
I did eſpie an hautie Youth, who ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fingly
ſtared upon me, ſeeming to
call me inſolent, for ſtriving to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chace
<hi>Urania,</hi> and conceiting himſelf
to be worthier of her, he did ſo amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
ſeal his eyes upon her, that
ſundry times he made her paint her
cheeks with harmleſs bluſhes: and
my jealous fancie comprehending no
other reaſon, than that as he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
free acceſs with his eyes, ſo he
might with his perſon; I rendring my
ſelf into the hands of cruel death.</p>
            <p>The Princeſs could no longer tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate
<hi>Claius</hi> in his ungrounded miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſts,
but interrupted him, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
him that <hi>Baſilius</hi> had ſent
for <hi>Muſidorus</hi> and <hi>Pyrocles;</hi> the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
happening to come at the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
time when they were extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
their Miſtreſſes; but then they
left off that ſubject till a more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
hour, and applied their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to the Intelligencer, promiſing
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:153743:87"/>
to follow ſpeedilie: yet contrarie to
their reſolutions, they lingred in
the way, a doalfull voice perſwading
them to ſtand and hearken, which
ſounded out theſe words.</p>
            <p>Faire <hi>Titan,</hi> why doſt thou deride
me with thy ſmiles, when I do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
to thy reſplendent beams! and
you pleaſant Bells, why do ye not
compel your notes to ring me to my
Funeral? for ſince ſhe is tyrannous,
why ſhould I live to endure her tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
my Superiors triumph in
their Loves: my Fellow ſhepherds
can boaſt of theirs: it is wretched
<hi>Philiſides,</hi> oh it is I that am ſingular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
miſerable, made ſo by a beautifull,
yet cruel Miſtriſs; the Princeſs knew
him to be <hi>Philiſides</hi> the deſpairing
Shepherd by his ſorowfull ſubject;
and he riſing from under an hedge,
diſcovered himſelf to be the ſame:
there the Princeſs leaving him in a
forlorn poſture, haſtened to their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:153743:87"/>
companie, to execute their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
which they had agreed upon as
they went: <hi>Claius</hi> and <hi>Strephon</hi> were
amazed at their ſight, their fear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
them to give way to ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
but their hopes bad them both
to burie ſadneſs in the lake of Oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
in this unſetled condition they
continued not long, the diviſion of
their thoughts being ſuppreſſed by
the Sentence which <hi>Muſidorus</hi> uttered
thus.</p>
            <p>An Oration might be acceptable to
the ears of theſe Auditors, but that
the Evening deſires me not to be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
eſpeciallie to theſe expecting
Lovers: in compaſſion to you both,
oh <hi>Claius</hi> and <hi>Strephon,</hi> I doe hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wiſh there were two <hi>Urania</hi>'s, and
ſhould be exceeding well content, if
ſome others were to decide this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
than my Coſen <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and my
ſelf, he for my ſake being equallie
oblieged with me to you for your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:153743:88"/>
courteſie to me when I was
a diſtreſſed ſtranger, and incompaſſed
by the frowns of Fortune; our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to you both may be evenly
ballanced, but your activitie cannot
be juſtlie ſummoned together: <hi>Claiu's</hi>
age manifeſts a dulneſs, and <hi>Strephon's</hi>
youth his lightſomneſs; or elſe your
worthieſt exploits, without diſputing,
might conquer <hi>Urania.</hi> At this
<hi>Claius,</hi> as if he had been revived, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
to jump, but his heels ſerved
him a trick, teaching him to kiſs his
mother Earth, as more ſuitable to his
ancient years than a young Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs
was: but he vexing at ſo publick
a diſaſter, fell in a rage upon <hi>Stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi>
who eſteemed it more Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to hold his hands, than to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
his blows, <hi>Claius</hi> holding in
diſdain his backwardneſs, left his ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs,
and turning to the Princeſs
with tears in his eyes, he beſeeched
them, if it ſhould be his unhappineſs
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:153743:88"/>
to be deprived of <hi>Urania,</hi> to grant him
the priviledge of her preſence, though
at as great a diſtance as poſſibly he
could diſcern her, <hi>Strephon</hi> not
knowing the ſubtiltie of Fortune, and
doubting the worſt, deſiſted not from
craving the like favour: the Princeſs
mercifully yielded to their requeſts,
and <hi>Muſidorus</hi> proceeded in his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Urania</hi> deſerves to poſſeſs the firſt
lodgings of the wiſeſt hearts, ſhe is
too pure to be a ſecond; out of
which conſideration, we have reſolv'd
that you ſhall both ſwear by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Name of <hi>Pan,</hi> whether you have
ever been defiled with another ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
or have been afflicted with <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pids</hi>
dart, though in a virtuous way;
which if you both can proteſt againſt,
we will prohibit this invention, and
determin on ſome other; and if but
one can clear himſelf, he ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
the fitteſt Husband for
her</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:153743:89"/>
               <hi>Strephon</hi> without ſcruple offered to
take his Oath; <hi>Claius,</hi> though he
was enticed by the force of Beautie,
yet his Conſcience withdrew him
from perjuring himſelf, perſwading
him to defer the time: the Princeſs
perceiving his ſlowneſs, gueſſed the
matter, and leſt he ſhould be ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the vanities of this world,
they commanded him and <hi>Strephon</hi>
to convey <hi>Urania</hi> to the Temple:
<hi>Muſidorus</hi> and <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> with <hi>Pamela</hi>
and <hi>Philoclea,</hi> and the other Royal
Bridegromes and Brides, beſides the
reſort of ſhepherds and ſhepherdeſſes
attending on them: where being
come, <hi>Claius</hi> and <hi>Strephon</hi> aſcended
to the Altar, and with great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<hi>Strephon</hi> profeſſed his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
from Female Creatures, and
withall his chaſte affection, which he
conſtantlie bare to <hi>Urania:</hi> and <hi>Claius</hi>
with jealous devotion affirmed that
<hi>Urania</hi> was a precious Jewel, locked
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:153743:89"/>
up in the Treaſurie of his heart, which
none could bereave him of, unleſs
they murdered him, neither ſpared he
room for any other to abide there, but
her Divine ſelf: yet he could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
but that in his younger days his
indulgent Phantaſie had ſeized upon
a Shepherdeſs, though not with anie
other entire affection than as her pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
ſongs enveigled him; and ſince
he had wholie abandoned her, and
cleaved to <hi>Urania,</hi> the ſevereſt Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
could not make that a ſufficient
pretence to give away his elected
Spouſe.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Claius</hi> advocated for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
but <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Muſidorus</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſilence to be made, and then <hi>Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi>
ſaid;</p>
            <p>For as much as you have referred
your ſelves, before evident Witneſs,
to the judgement of Prince <hi>Pyrocles</hi>
and my ſelf; who without any expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to your ſide, have ſincerelie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:153743:90"/>
it upon you; we will admit
of no addreſſes to recal our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for that were to accuſe our
ſelves of Infidelitie; but we will not
ſee it put in execution: and <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rephon</hi>
ſhall enjoy his firſt Love, the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſs
<hi>Urania,</hi> and <hi>Claius</hi> may dwell
in the view of her, to ſave him from
periſhing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Strephon,</hi> as a man who newly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
a life ranſomed from the
power of hatefull death, to inhabit a
glorious Paradice, ſnatched <hi>Urania</hi>
from out of the hands of amazed
<hi>Claius,</hi> and in a raviſhment ran for
the Prieſt of <hi>Pan,</hi> who in the mid'ſt
of the throng, conſumated their Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
This laſt Couple wanted not
aplauſes, though they were inferior
to the other in dignitie; for <hi>Straphons</hi>
comelineſs, and <hi>Urania</hi>'s gracefulneſs
ſeemed to adorn their harmleſs roabs:
their becomming Modeſtie enthral'd
the hearts of their obſervers, their
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:153743:90"/>
courteſie conquered the eyes of their
profeſſion, that beheld in what eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
they were with the Princes,
and their happineſs equalled the
greateſt Perſonages.</p>
            <p>But alas, in <hi>Strephon</hi>'s felicity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
<hi>Claiu's</hi> miſerie, his grief being ſo
infinite, that his paſſages of tears was
ſtopped, and a frantick Brain poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
him more than a Womaniſh
ſorrow, againſt this life he exclaimed,
<hi>Strephon</hi> and himſelf he abhorred,
and endeavouring to ſet a Period to
his afflictions, he brake out into theſe
words: Proud love, who glorieſt in
tormenting mortals, this once mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
thy rage by dispatching me
quickly from under thy Tyrannie; for
in what have I displeaſed thee, you
cannot ſignifie, I have ſo faithfully
ſerved to your crueltie. But now to
gratifie me, you plunder me of my
onely bleſſing, and yet in deriſion you
make mee to live. But O <hi>Cupid!</hi> if any
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:153743:91"/>
pitie or remorſe dares harbour in
thee, as thou haſt deeply wounded
me, ſo directly ſlay me, and I ſhall
entitle thee mercifull. But if thou
flieſt from ſuch a compaſſionate act,
then Prince <hi>Muſidorus</hi> and <hi>Pyrocles,</hi>
whoſe fame is enriched with goodneſs,
repleniſh it more by my ſpeedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
and make me breathleſs.
And Shepherds and Shepherdeſſes,
let not the dreadfull Name of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy
affright you, my Death will be
the obſequies of a Comedy; therefore
if any ſpleen reign victor in you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
your ſelf upon me that am the
moſt contemptible wretch.</p>
            <p>This Speech he uttered with ſuch
diſtracted actions, that terrified
the women and afflicted the men.
But at appointment of the Princes
they conveyed him to ſome private
habitation, where he had attendants,
who oftentimes prevented him from
miſchieving himſelf. But for <hi>Stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:153743:91"/>
and <hi>Urania,</hi> the Princes ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
invited them to their ſocietie for
that evening, where at <hi>Pamela</hi>'s and
<hi>Philoclea</hi>'s entreaties, they retiring to
a pleaſant ſummer Houſe, <hi>Strephon</hi>
rehearſed theſe paſſages concerning
<hi>Urania, Claius,</hi> and himſelf, on this
manner:</p>
            <p>To recollect <hi>Urania</hi>'s virtues, or
what ſurpaſſing beautie engaged <hi>Clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
and me to be her ſervants, would
be ſuperfluous, ſince her divine ſelf is
preſent to merit divine, praiſes from
the dulleſt ſpectators Onely firſt her
prettie innocence withdrew our eyes
from gazing on the ſtars, to ſalute
her heavenly ſpheres that reflected
upon us as ſhe paſſed by. For <hi>Claius</hi>
and I having ſeparated our Flocks
from our neighbouring ſhepherds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a freſh and ſweet paſture, where
none frequented or trode the pleaſant
graſs, but ſavage Satyrs, and dancing
Fairies, we eſpied a Tree, whoſe flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:153743:92"/>
branches ſeemed to fortifie
themſelves againſt the heat of the
ſun, and we enticed by the ſhadow,
repaired to it: there we lay down,
purpoſing to trie our skill in deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
the pitifull decorums of the
ſhepherds that were inchanted by <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pids</hi>
quiver, to adore the fair beautie
of Mortals: but the wonderfull Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of the higheſt Powers, taught us
to acknowledge our frailtie, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
the like puniſhment upon us:
for as we were reproching their love-ſick
infirmities, fair <hi>Urania,</hi> enduced
by a Sparrow that flew from her
when ſhe had courteouſly bred it up,
purſued after it, to take it priſoner, her
courſe bending towards us: but when
ſhe had ſurprized it, ſhe confined it
to a Paradiſe, putting it between the
pillows of her Breaſt, and checking it
no otherwiſe than with her harmleſs
kiſſes, ſhe went away, leaving <hi>Claius</hi>
and my carkaſs behind her, but our
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:153743:92"/>
ſouls cleaved immoveably unto her,
and fixing our eyes upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as aſhamed of our prodigious
cenſoriouſneſs of our Neighbours, we
ſuffered not our lips to open, till we
were acquainted with the ſubject that
did triumph over us; but ſounding
our Bell, we ſecured our Flocks, and
haſtened to repoſe our ſelves upon our
beds, but our memorie of the moſt
Divine <hi>Urania</hi> taught us a more
watchfull leſſon than drouſineſs: her
Image, which was engraven in our fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
disdained to be blurred by our
forgetfulneſs, wherefore the reſtleſs
night we paſſed over with ſighs, revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Fates for burying our felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in the depth of adverſitie, ſo hard
and explete did we account it ever to
obtain <hi>Urania;</hi> and though <hi>Claius</hi>
and I were one anothers Rivalls, both
aiming at one, yet did it not any way
mittigate our friendſhip, I applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Claius</hi> choice, and he mine; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:153743:93"/>
did we ignorantly admire our
judgements, but did enquire, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the approbation of a multitude
of Swains, who with abundant devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
extolled <hi>Urania</hi>'s worth: yet
Fortune, that favours not the pureſt
ſouls, knit her brows, frowning upon
our Goddeſs <hi>Urania,</hi> who mildly
ſtrived to waſh them away with her
Chriſtal tears: the occaſion I heard
her whiſper out one time, when ſhe
imagined little, and I reſided ſo near
her, in theſe ſweetly expreſſed, yet
dollorous words.</p>
            <p>Too great a burden for me to bear
oppreſſes me, <hi>Antaxius</hi> is too offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in his love, I wiſh he were more
calm; my Parents rigor is too too
intollerable, unleſs my disobedience
had been palpable; I have never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
them wilfully, no not in this
their deſired Match, except they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
my ſilence for a refuſal, that
being the onely ſymptom of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:153743:93"/>
nor do I reveal my affection
to any but to thee my Sparrow, who
canſt not diſcover it with thy chirp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and that note of thine is to me
condoling, and chearfull; my
disconſolate Heart not knowing
how to value any other melodious
ſounds: but alaſs my incredulitie of
the divine Providence may juſtlie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
and puniſh me; yet ſince I do
humbly acknowledge thy alſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
let thy Mercie chaſtiſe me, and
deliver me from the thraldom of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then wiping her bedewed eyes, ſhe
aroſe, as confident her devout Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
had conjured the Gods to pitie
her diſtreſs, and beſeeching the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to make me their inſtrument;
call'd after her. Fair Creature, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
me if I profane your ſacred Title
with a feeble one, ſince your humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
vouchſafes earthly troubles to
perplex you; and believe me, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:153743:94"/>
of this world is built upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
motions, it can boaſt of no firm
foundation; the rareſt Beauties in
their age ſeldom eſcape advers Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
and boyſterous winds, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
relying on a Rock, their periſhing
is ſure: wherefore, ſweet Nimph,
accept of me to be your Rock, and
queſtionleſs you ſhall be preſerved
from all tempeſtuous weathers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Urania</hi> truſting in no other Power,
than what was celeſtial, looked up to
the Element, where ſeeing no hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venlie
Object, ſhe caſt her eyes down,
fixing them upon me with ſuch bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs,
as ſtrook me to the ground,
not being capable of aſſiſting my ſelf;
however I fed upon her voice, which
ſhe diſplayed in this language.</p>
            <p>What a preſumptuous mortal art
thou to frame thy ſelf to be a God,
that by ſuch a pretence thou mayſt
inſult over me? For better Powers
cannot ſupport me from furious
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:153743:94"/>
ſtorms. This ſpoken, ſhe went away,
as loathing the ſight of ſuch a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
ſerpent, as ſhe thought me
to be. Which I perceiving, and row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
my ſelf from out of a tranſe,
I began to crie, O ſtay, ſtay, ſtay, but
ſhe deaf to my perſwaſions, haſtened
beyond the limits of mine eyes; but
the rebounding of my words ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the ears of the Paſtor <hi>Claius,</hi>
who was with his and my Flock at a
little diſtance from me. He harkening
to my voice, and discerning me to
wander out of the cloſe, his jealous
brain ſuppoſed the reaſon, &amp; walking
as ſwiftly as his aged leggs would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him, he found me out, his inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiveneſs
enforcing me not to be
niggardly in my anſwers, which were
ſo tedious, that the Sun vaniſhed from
our Horizon, as tired with our unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
ſpeeches, and took his farewel,
highing him to his Eaſtern home. But
at length <hi>Claius</hi> and I yielding our
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:153743:95"/>
ſelves to ſilence though not to reſt,
experience had taught us to deſpair
of ſleeping, until <hi>Cupids</hi> wounds wear
curable. And early in the morning
when the Sheperdeſſes had driven
their Flocks into the Paſtures, we
lingering with ours, that we might ſee
the place made happie with <hi>Urania</hi>'s
abiding there, her Enimie <hi>Antaxius</hi>
the wealthy Heardsman, driven by a
flattering current of his ſucceſs, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched
near us, not ſcrupulous in
asking <hi>Urania</hi>'s harbour: we making
much of our opportunitie directed
him the contrary way from her, to
the Iſland of <hi>Citherea,</hi> her Parents
dwelling there, onely they had truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her with the Flock on this ſide
the River, to feed them with a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
paſture. But we proteſted to him,
that in the morning we ſaw the Graſs
to weep for her departure, and the
ſeas dance with joy that ſhe relyed on
their mildneſs. <hi>Antaxius</hi> eaſily belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:153743:95"/>
our intilligence, and thanking us
for it, he haſtened to overtake her: and
we pleaſed with our proſperous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tletie,
drove our Flocks to a Paſture
adjoyning to <hi>Urania's,</hi> and entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Pan</hi> to be their Guardian, we left
them to trie Fortunes courteſie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Urania</hi> bluſhing at our preſence, at
mine eſpecially, who had before ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly
aſſaulted her, ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
me with it, as in earneſt ſo it
did, my trembling witneſſed my guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs,
and my tears and ſighs my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:
my ſlowneſs to utterance
allowed <hi>Claius</hi> a convenient time to
discover his paſſion to <hi>Urania,</hi> the
policie uſed to <hi>Antaxius,</hi> he forbore
to repeat, until my repentance had
obtained a pardon, and then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
in what expedition we ſent away
her undeſired ſuitor; which at firſt
vaniſhed the red from her face, her
fears uſurping in her tender breaſt,
leſt her Parents ſhould doubt her
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:153743:96"/>
ſafetie at <hi>Antaxius</hi> report. Yet when
ſhe remembred her abſence might
extinguiſh <hi>Antaxtus</hi> luſt, her vermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
came back to mixture, and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her, as deteſting to be deprived of
ſuch an Alabaſter ſhelter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Claius</hi> made Poeſies in her praiſe
to pleaſe her, dedicating to her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
all his ſtudies. My art in framing
of Garlands, ſhewing the flowers na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
curiouſitie in their varietie of
ſhades, a device that ſets them forth
moſt perfectly I did teach her; often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
preſenting her with the choiſeſt
of my Flock, when ſhe would accept
of them; and if Wolves or other ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous
beaſts had happened to lurk
that way, I never left hunting them
till their hands evidenced me their
Conqueror, which I uſed to lay at
<hi>Urania</hi>'s feet; other tricks I invented
to be admitted into her ſocietie.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Strephon</hi> ſtopt: but the
Princes entreated him to go on.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:153743:96"/>
Which happineſs of mine, ſaith he,
continued not long without interru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.
<hi>Antaxius</hi> learning that <hi>Claius</hi>
and I pretended affection to <hi>Urania,</hi>
he proudly landed at our haven, rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
carrying her away without reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
Her commands, that could not
be diſobeyed, ordained the contrary.
Then it was, moſt gracious Prince
<hi>Muſidorus</hi> that you eſcaped the ſeas,
O then it was that <hi>Urania</hi> floted on
them, and we bitterly bemoaned our
loſs. Certainly by the appointment of
the Gods the Ocean waxed ſo calm,
yet about where ſhe was embarqued,
the waters murmured, and the winds
ſweetly whiſtled, combining their
voices ſo harmoniouſly, that ſhe
might really believe, they conſpired
to crown her with ſome unexpected
bleſſing; as indeed ſo they: had for
when we had conducted you to my
Lord <hi>Kalenders</hi> houſe, we received a
Letter from our adored Goddeſs.
<pb n="704" facs="tcp:153743:97"/>
We might have been juſtly taxed of
incredulitie at the firſt view of it, our
rememberance of her uncivil Carrier
demolliſhing all hopefull thoughts;
but when we had more believingly
read over and ſaluted thoſe heavenly
lines, we taking a ſhort farewel of
your Highnes, conformed our pace to
our eagereſt diſpoſition, and came to
the Sands againſt the Iſland of <hi>Cithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea;</hi>
where not caring for any other
paſſage but <hi>Charon's</hi> Boat, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
our ſelves to heavens prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and fixed our eyes upon <hi>Ura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>'s
Iſland, leaping into the ſea,
there we had like to have participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of <hi>Leander</hi>'s entertainment, but
our luckie Stars preſerved us to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
fortune. The waves growing tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent,
the winds roared, the skies
thickened, and all tempeſtuous wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
threatened to combine againſt
us. My Friend <hi>Claiu's</hi> faint limbs I
was glad to ſupport with my tired
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:153743:97"/>
ones, and we both had periſhed and
reſigned our breaths to the Giver,
but that the ſtorm forced a Bark to
caſt Anchor, and harbour in our
Coaſt, from whence we had not ſwom
far, though the Billows had thrown
us up and down, as contemning us for
our preſumption in purſuing our
loves to <hi>Urania,</hi> but the companie in
the Bark, weighing our calamities,
and their own too, ſhould they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
ſo charitable an act as endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to help us, imagining the Gods
would be deaf to their prayers, if
they were careleſs of ours: they let
their ſails flie towards us, &amp; lengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the cord of their Cock-boat, they
ſent it to us; we skilled in their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
laid hold on it, and by degrees we
purchaſed the in-ſides for our ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
they pulling us to the Bark, helped
us in.</p>
            <p>Where we were gazed on with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment
by all; neither were our
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:153743:98"/>
eyes indebted to theirs, ſo manie of
<hi>Urania</hi>'s Aſſociats did we eſpie in the
Bark to look upon; and amongſt the
reſt there was <hi>Antaxius:</hi> Oh <hi>Claius,</hi>
hadſt thou been here, thou wouldſt
have juſtified thy paleneſs, and my
cholerick fluſhes, that with zeal
ſtrove for Victorie over our haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
Rival; who being vexed at the
ſight of us, and minding nothing ſo
much as our fatal ruine, ſtretched his
voice, which was moſt hideous, to
condemn us. What monſters are
theſe, ſaid he, that you have had
pitie upon? their Phiyſiognomies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
ours, but the ſhape is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
therefore hurl them over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board,
leſt they do drown us with
their Inchantment. The gulph of
ſalt-Water that flew out of our
mouths, and our wett garments that
hung confuſedly, with his aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
pierced into the ſtupid ſenſes of
the Companie, who doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:153743:98"/>
we were very <hi>Claius</hi> and <hi>Stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi>
or no, yet dreaded to queſtion
us: my anger for <hi>Antaxius</hi> unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
affronting us, could not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated,
but acting the fierceneſs of a
Tygar, I fell upon him, and flung
him into the ſea, where he deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
taſted of ſuch pleaſures, as he had
allotted for us: ſuch is the wiſdom
of the higher Powers to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
what is due.</p>
            <p>The affrighted People fled into
their Cabins, the Pilot and Sailors
forſaking their imployments, hid
themſelves under the Decks: but all
this time I never ceaſed to pray for
<hi>Urania</hi>'s ſafeguard, being ignorant of
the chance that brought <hi>Antaxius</hi>
thither, or where ſhe reſided; her let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ſignifying onely how much ſhe
wiſhed to ſee us, our vowed friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
obliging her in all virtuous ways
to honor us: but having quelled the
courage of the Sailors, the ſtorm aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaging,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:153743:99"/>
we ſhewed our authoritie,
commanding them to ſtrike their ſail
to the Iſland of <hi>Citherea:</hi> and giving
a viſit to our Priſoners in the Cabins,
we intreated them to ſuppreſs all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
conceit of us, who never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to injure them, though we
had revenged our ſelves upon <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxius</hi>
for ſcandalizing us, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading
them barbarouſly to murder
us, under the pretence of Sea-Monſters:
nor did we neglect to tell
them how infinitly they would favor
us, in relating what accident had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed
<hi>Antaxius</hi> to that Bark, without
his Miſtreſs <hi>Urania,</hi> who was report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be his onely delight.</p>
            <p>The young Shepherd <hi>Lalus,</hi> being
preſent, interrupted me thus: <hi>Urania</hi>
diſdains to be the Miſtreſs of ſo baſe
a fellow, though his importunitie
both to her neareſt relations, and to
her divine ſelf, forced her to grant
him the priviledge of Charactering
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:153743:99"/>
her perfections in Poetrie, amongſt
which he had declared his Luſt, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing
it with the title of Love,
when he might as well transform a
Dove to a Kite, or a Wolf to a
Lamb, as luſt to Love; <hi>Urania</hi> abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him for it, charged me, who am
bound to obey her charge, to be ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
with <hi>Antaxius</hi> to come this voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
with me. I aſſaulted him with
the queſtion; he thought it no ways
requiſit for his proceedings, but at her
perſwaſions he ceaſed to argue: This
Voyage we intended for a chearfull
one, but it hath proved a fatal one to
him, though a fortunate one to <hi>Ura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia;</hi>
for ſhe as far excels <hi>Antaxius</hi> in
deſerts, as our Princeſs <hi>Pamela</hi> does
<hi>Mopſa,</hi> Maſter <hi>Dameta's</hi> daughter.</p>
            <p>At this paſſage the Princeſs ſmiled,
and <hi>Strephon</hi> bluſhed at his true, yet
blunt expreſſion: but longing to be
freed from Tautalogizing, his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie
not ſuffering him to Court
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:153743:100"/>
               <hi>Urania</hi> there, he perſiſted in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſal.</p>
            <p>It afflicted me to reckon; O I could
not reckon the number of Rivals
that waited to fruſtrate me of my
felicitie, all that ever beheld her, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
her, few they were that did
not Court her, but moſt lived in
hopes to enjoy her; however I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
my grief, and congratulated
with <hi>Lalus</hi> for his courteous relation,
telling him, I had ſeen that Paragon,
and did as much admire her, as I
could any of her ſex, though my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
conſiſted chiefly in other recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
than to extoll a woman. This
drift of mine enticed him earneſtly to
better my opinion, and in his higheſt
Rhetorick, he laboured to inform me
concerning the Paſſion of Love, that
though it were mixed with bitterneſs,
in conſideration of ſome griefs that
follow it, yet ſeldom it is. but that
the concluſion is happie. I making as
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:153743:100"/>
though I liſtened not to his diſcourſe,
ſung a ſong, the ſubject whereof tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
againſt Love and Women: he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
in his deſires to work my
converſion, determined to bring me
to <hi>Urania.</hi> I willingly ſeemed to
yield to his requeſt, <hi>Claius</hi> wondred
at my diſguiſed heart, yet held his
peace, truſting to my poor diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Now the Sea-men, bringing us
news of our ſafe arrival in the Ports
of <hi>Citherea,</hi> we landed, releaſing the
Bark; I could hardly confine my
joy within ſo ſmall a compaſs as my
heart, when I went upon the ground
where ſhe had trode, and not reveal
it; but I reſtrained it as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
I could, ſlighting his deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Urania</hi>'s worth. But alas my
hopes of the ſucceſs, my deſignment
might have, was fruſtrated; upon ſo
tottering a climat do we Mortals reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
live, that when we think we have
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:153743:101"/>
eſcaped the dangerouſeſt ſtorms, our
feet ſtand upon the brims, ready to
be blown down at evry flirt of wind,
to the depth of miſerie.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Urania,</hi> my ſecret Jewel, and
<hi>Lalus</hi> that reveiled me, was miſſing,
not to publick Paſtorals, nor yet ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie
Retirements, but by the foul
practiſes of a Knight named <hi>Lacemon,</hi>
who violently carried her away from
her ſheep, whilſt ſhe was complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Claius</hi> and my tedious abſence;
the reporter of this dolefull News
lay hid under a hedge, the gliſtering
of rude <hi>Lacemon</hi>'s Armour adviſing
him to conceal himſelf; ſuch was the
cowardlineſs of the ſimple Swain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lalus</hi> would have murdered him,
had not we by force withheld him;
yet I made him feel the ſtroak of my
Cudgel, to make him repent his folly,
a poor revenge for ſo hainous a treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs,
yet that disburdened me of a
greater, ſo ſubject are we in affliction
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:153743:101"/>
to double our error with a crime
more odious: <hi>Urania</hi> was loſt, yet
the memorie of her Name, Virtue or
Beautie could never be expired: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did we linger in purſuance of
<hi>Lacemon,</hi> nor in her ſearch, whoſe
heavenly ſoul, as we imagined, muſt
needs perfume and leave a ſcent
where it had breathed, which was the
ſigne that we beſought the Sacred
Powers to grant, might be our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy
to her. Then <hi>Lalus</hi> departed
from us, chooſing his path; <hi>Claius</hi>
and I would not be ſeparated, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
we could avoid it. I know not
whether this unwillingneſs to part
with me proceeded from a jealous
humour, his nature being always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable
to it; but I am ſure, mine
was real, doubting not, but what the
Divine Providence had agreed on,
ſhould be accompliſhed what ere it
were.</p>
            <p>The byeſt ways, as we conceived,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:153743:102"/>
might be the likelieſt to find <hi>Urania,
Lacemon</hi> having many: his felicitie,
ſince he had deprived the Land of its
Goddeſs, and we as deeply ingaged
againſt him, our preſumptuous Rival,
as any other, ſearched the moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitious
Corners; but no tidings
could be heard of <hi>Urania</hi> up the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland,
where we had wandered, except
profane ones; for ask the Swains
that ſluggiſhly ſate nodding by ſome
of their ſcattered ſheep, whoſe fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
had been devoured by Wolves,
through the careleſneſs of their Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,
when we examined them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Urania,</hi> whom we deſcribed
by her Praiers and tears made to a
Knight accoutred in a Martial habit;
their reply would be ſo abſurd, nay
between ſleeping and waking, divers
did affirm they ſaw her, directing us
to unſeemly Mortals, who indeed had
uſurped <hi>Urania</hi>'s Name, though they
came ſhort of her perfections. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:153743:102"/>
judge which was victor in me of
Rage and Sorrow; furious I was at
the counterfeit <hi>Urania's,</hi> and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
deſpairing of ever finding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
one.</p>
            <p>At this paſſage <hi>Strephon</hi> burſt out
into floods of tears, which he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to conceal, excuſing his too
large rehearſal, &amp; deſired to break off;
but the Princeſs earneſtneſs to hear
<hi>Urania</hi> reſcued from the power of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemon,</hi>
induced him to proceed on
this manner: My chollerick Paſſion
I vented upon the ſtupid men, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing
them to entitle their Dames
with ſome meaner Name than <hi>Ura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
under penaltie of their lives,
which they dearly valued: and then
<hi>Claius</hi> and I renewed our languiſhing
travels.</p>
            <p>When we had paſſed through the
publick and remote places of the
Iſland, meeting with no obſtacles in
the way, either by Freinds or Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:153743:103"/>
we croſſed the Ocean, landing
at the ſands over againſt the Iſland,
we continued not there, though we
could not determin where we had beſt
continue, but a Pilgrims life we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
on, unleſs <hi>Uraina</hi>'s unexpected
ſecuritie ſhould forbid it; when there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we had traced about the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
reports of her, we roſe with
the Sun, to take a longer journey, but
the tiredneſs of our legs prolonged
the time, and ſo proved faithfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
to further our felicitie, by
delaying our haſte: Upon a bank we
ſate down, chaſing at the graſs for
looking freſh and green in <hi>Urania</hi>'s
abſence; and <hi>Claius</hi> folding his arms,
and caſting his eyes on the ground,
as a fit object for him to view, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when he pitched on ſuch a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
as deſerved oppoſition, as he
then did; uttering theſe words:</p>
            <p>Seldom it is, but the faireſt Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiognomies
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:153743:103"/>
harbour the fouleſt ſouls,
all reaſon proves it ſo; nay the Gods
abhor partialitie; why then ſhould
they adorn a Creature ſo richly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing
above the reſt viſibly, and yet
give her a foul anſwerable? <hi>Urania!</hi>
O <hi>Urania!</hi> I will not, no I durſt not
ſay unchaſte, though the Summers
mourn not for her exilement, nor the
Birds ceaſe from their various notes,
which comfort we heretofore appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
they made to invite <hi>Urania</hi> to
reſide altogether in the Woods; nor
yet the Shepherds refrain from their
pleaſant ſports; nor do the Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes
neglect their care of medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their tender Lambs, to celebrate
a Day in their bewailings.</p>
            <p>Age we reckon ſtands at the gate
of Death: yet <hi>Claius</hi> years was a Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
to defend him from it, otherwiſe
I ſhould not have thought a replie a
ſufficient revenge, which I did in theſe
terms. A ſuſpitious head is as great
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:153743:104"/>
a torment as I could wiſh to light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Lacemon,</hi> beſides the unjuſtneſs
of it, your uncharitable cenſures may
too ſoon redound upon you, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
hath loſt its opportunitie to
crave and receive a pardon: expoſe
not your ſelf to that crime, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
can be purged away, ſhould it
dammage the reputation of thoſe that
imitate <hi>Diana's</hi> qualities in as great a
meaſure as her Beautie; for if the
Gods have beſtowed on them rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
ſouls, why ſhould we pine at
their induſtrie to make them admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable:
You argue, that the Summer
keeps its natural courſe, though <hi>Ura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
is miſſing, which is a manifeſt te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie
of her virtues, boiſterous
and cold weather being a foe to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velers,
but the warm Sun is delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
and the birds proudly chant their
Tunes, for I am confident, they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh
her far above the loftie expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of <hi>Lacemon:</hi> neither wonder at
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:153743:104"/>
the mirth and imployments of the
Shepherds and Shepherdeſſes, for the
Virgins are glad to exerciſe their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
to charm back the belief of
<hi>Urania</hi>'s loſs, ſo darkſom and odious
is it to them, the Shepherds their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramours
foſtering (though with ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs)
their buſie fancies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Claius</hi> fixing his eyes on the ground,
as convinced of his error, ſought not
to frame an excuſe, yet to ſhew that
Age had not deprived him of his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
he thus ſpake: An odoriferous
ſcent ſeems to command me to reſt
ſilent, and to bear the blame without
controulment, and dreadfulneſs mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with hope poſſeſs me. O <hi>Strephon,
Strephon,</hi> faithfully conceal my follie,
I beſeech thee.</p>
            <p>At this ſuddain Allarm, I gazed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
me, an happie ſight, though an
amazed one approaching near me,
<hi>Urania</hi> it was, with her arms ſpread,
and cryes in her mouth, which menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:153743:105"/>
murder, her hair contemptibly
hung about her, though delicate; and
patience and anger ſeemed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
in her roſie cheeks for the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie;
but at the laſt, abundance of
Chriſtal tears became the Arbiter,
which when ſhe had vented; ſhe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed
to us theſe words:</p>
            <p>Never was I yet in the Turret of
felicitie, but I have ſtumbled, and fell
to the pit of adverſitie: <hi>Antaxius,</hi> in
the Iſland of <hi>Citherea</hi> luſtfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
me; and here, if I continue, the
Furie <hi>Lacemon</hi> will overtake me; O
whither ſhall I flie for ſafetie? my
pitie would not ſuffer me to retain her
in ignorance, wherefore I related <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxius</hi>
death: her ſilence ſeemed to
condemn me of raſhneſs, for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him no time of repentance; but
my excuſe was prevented by the rage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
coming of <hi>Lacemon,</hi> who with
eyes ſparkling, and Armour ſtained
with bloud, an Emblem of the Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:153743:105"/>
he had committed, holding in his
right hand a ſpear, and a ſhield in his
left, he muſtered up to us; we no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
dreading, but <hi>Urania</hi>'s tremble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with our ſtaves, weak inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
(as he imagined) to reſiſt him,
made towards him: he diſdaining
<hi>Claius</hi> age, and my youth, exerciſed
neither vigilance to withſtand our
blows, nor ſtrength to repay them: I
vexed at his ſo ſlight regard of my
valour, and perſwading <hi>Claius</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
to <hi>Urania,</hi> who willingly yielded
to my counſel; I renewed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter,
and with ſuch fierceneſs,
that <hi>Lacemon</hi> was forced to ſtand on
his own defence; his want of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
might be the cauſe of his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw;
for I am certain I can boaſt
but of little that cauſed it, though the
fortune of my blows proved fatal to
him, thruſting him off his horſe, and
beating out his brains: his life was
ſo hatefull, that his death was wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed
<pb n="788" facs="tcp:153743:106"/>
by moſt, and commiſerated
of none: <hi>Urania</hi> highly commended
my action, too large a recompence
for ſo poor a deſert, yet I thanked
the Gods for giving me ſuch ſucceſs
as ſhe thought worthie of her accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
and waiting upon her to the
Iſland of <hi>Citherea,</hi> by the way ſhe
yielded to our requeſt, gracefully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
theſe words.</p>
            <p>The motions of this world I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
comprehend, but with confuſion,
ſo unexpectedly do they ſurprize me,
<hi>Antaxius</hi> by <hi>Lalus</hi> inſtigations, truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Seas fidelitie, your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion
forcing them to deceive him,
in whoſe baniſhment I ſent a Letter to
you, wherein I acknowledged your
ſincere affection, and by all the ties of
virtuous friendſhip, conjured you not
to denie me your Counſel or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
in my extremitie; and happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to repoſe my ſelf upon the Clifts,
my harmleſs Sparrow I ſet down at a
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:153743:106"/>
little diſtance from me, learning it to
come at my inducement, the prettie
fool, with ſhivering wings aſpired to
mount towards me; but the Tyger
<hi>Lacemon,</hi> or Monſter, for his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
could never pretend to huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
being prepared in a readineſs to
commit ſuch a treacherous act, came
from a darkſom hole, ſuitable to his
practiſes, and ſeized on me and my
Sparrow for Priſoners, and convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us to his provided Boat, we were
ſailed over, and by him conducted to
this Countrey of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> where in a
Cave he hath encloſed me: and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
that I conſorted with my
Bird, and delighted in its Innocencie,
a virtue which he mortally deteſted,
he unmercifully murdered it, linger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
tormenting it to death, whilſt
my Sparrow with its dying looks,
ſeemed to check me, for enduring its
ſufferance without reſiſtance: thus he
endeavoured to terrifie me with his
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:153743:107"/>
crueltie, but if it were poſſible, it
made me more enflamed to withſtand
his aſſaults; neither threats, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties
were wanting to tempt me to
his baſe deſires, but I abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
him, till neceſſitie perſwaded
me to trie the effect of Policie.</p>
            <p>His own reports ſignifying <hi>Phalan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Helena,</hi> the Queen of <hi>Corinths</hi>
Brothers defiance to the <hi>Arcadian</hi>
Knights, his Lance willing to defend
his Miſtreſs <hi>Sorteſia</hi>'s beautie againſt
other Champions; I counterfeited
earneſtneſs to <hi>Lacemon,</hi> in exerciſing
his skill to purchaſe my glorie: he
puffed up with hopes of future ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
conſidering it was the firſt time
that I had imployed him, and ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licklie,
with all expedition, haſted
to the lodge with my Picture, where
by a thruſt from off his horſe, he was
made to leave my Picture to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<hi>Sortaſia</hi>'s ſurpaſſing one; with a
cloudie ſoul, he returned to me, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:153743:107"/>
compaſſed to ſtay within his
bounds, ſo manie bars and bolts
fruſtrating my eſcape; but by his
muttering I diſcerned his diſcontent,
an humour that beſt ſuited his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
I ſtrictly examined concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my Pictures triumph, and his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
he ſtudying to delude me, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
That buſineſs of importance
had enforced <hi>Biſilius</hi> to defer the
challenge for awhile, out of which
regard, he, by the example of other
Noble Perſonages, reſigned up my
Picture to the cuſtodie of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of <hi>Baſilius</hi> lodge, and ſhould be
extremelie well pleaſed, if I would
vouchſafe him my companie into the
freſh aire; few perſwaſions ſerved to
remove me from that ſtifling cave,
beſides the hopes that I relied upon
of your encountering <hi>Lacemon;</hi> but
little imagined the Shepherd <hi>Lalus</hi>
would be the firſt; kind <hi>Lalus!</hi> it
was the leaſt of my thoughts of thy
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:153743:108"/>
ſo chearfullie looſing thy life for the
preſervation of mine; for when <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
had with boaſtings, for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
overcome by any of his ſubjected
Rivalls, brought me near the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> ſwelling with pride,
his rough Arms rudely ſtriving with
me: then it was that <hi>Lalus</hi> ſuccoured
me with his own fatal ruine: for
though I was by <hi>Lacemon</hi> deſguiſed,
by his ſuggeſtion, I knowing no other
ſigne, he diſcovered me to be <hi>Ura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia:</hi>
his deſire to reſcue me from
<hi>Lacemon,</hi> extinguiſhed the reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of his own eminent danger, his
courage, though exceeding <hi>Lacemons,</hi>
yet his ſtrength and ſhield was far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
to him, in the heat of the blows,
before conqueſt, was decided on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide; I fled from dreadfull <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemon,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His ſpeedie purſuance after me,
might be a means to preſerve <hi>Lalus</hi>
life, yet I doubt it, <hi>Lacemons</hi> bloudie
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:153743:108"/>
Armour prenominating his wicked
action<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But I proteſt, that I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
my skin ſhould imitate <hi>Pan</hi>'s,
and my complexion <hi>Vulcan</hi>'s, than
that any one Tragedie ſhould be
committed in its defence.</p>
            <p>Fountains running from <hi>Urania</hi>'s
ſparkling eyes, ſtopped the remainder
of her ſpeech. <hi>Lalus</hi> being my aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Rival, mitigated very much my
ſorrow for him. However, leſt I
ſhould forfeit <hi>Urania</hi>'s favour, I ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſad, yet ſtrived with it, that I
might be a more acceptable inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to moderate hers. Neither was
<hi>Claius</hi> negligent in his love, but with
Rhetorical ſpeeches he ſought to win
on her affections; and the Iſland of
<hi>Citharea</hi> in awhile flouriſhed with her
adored Goddeſs. Her Parents in
heavenly raptures welcomed home
their deareſt Daughter, keeping her
watchfully under their eyes, and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of our depriving them of her the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:153743:109"/>
ſecond time, though we had ſafely
delivered her into their hands. And
<hi>Urania</hi> her ſelf ſuſpecting our often
reſorting to her, might redound to
her prejudice, made excuſes to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
our companie. But death in a
ſhort time appeared in his viſage to
<hi>Urania</hi>'s Parents, carrying them to
the Elizian fields: ſhe then having the
libertie to diſpoſe of her ſelf, which
ſhe with confinement did, not delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Paſtorals, nor yet in our
ſocietie, until this happie Day was
nominated. And now great Princes,
I humbly beſeech you to pardon this
my tedious Relation.</p>
            <p>The Princes courteouſly declared
<hi>Strephon</hi> to be worthieſt of <hi>Urania,</hi>
the particulars of his exploits witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it <hi>Baſilius</hi> on that day preferring
him in his Court, honouring him
with Knighthood, and both he and
his Ladie <hi>Urania</hi> lived in great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
with all, obtaining love and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:153743:109"/>
eſteem from the ſtatelieſt Cedar to
loweſt ſhrub.</p>
            <p>But when <hi>Cynthia</hi> drew her cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
cammanding the Princes to
hide themſelves within their Pavili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and they retiring to obey her;
juſt then an unuſual voice ſounded to
them, and cloſe behind it ruſhed in
<hi>Lalus</hi> the Shepherd: anger compoſed
with reverence beſet him, both being
ſo officious, that reverence environed
Paſſion within the compaſſe of civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and Paſſion allowed Reverence
to ſhew a prettie decent behaviour,
though not affected; both dying
cheeks with ruddineſs, whileſt he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
his ſpeech to <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidorus</hi>
ſpake to this purpoſe:</p>
            <p>Great Princes, I will not preſume
to queſtion your Juſtice, but your
knowledge. It was I that gave <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
his deaths wound. <hi>Strephon</hi> did
but leſſen his torments by quick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching
him when he fled from me,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:153743:110"/>
pretending <hi>Urania</hi> was his onely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
that he deſired to enjoy, and
not my bloud.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Princes certifying</hi> Lalus, <hi>that
other arguments enjoyned them to
beſtow</hi> Urania <hi>on</hi> Strephon, <hi>they left
him, but not ſo disconſolate for</hi> Ura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia'<hi>s
loſs, as to keep his eloquence
from courting other Shepherdeſſes,
in as high a degree as ever he did her.
But aged</hi> Claius, <hi>having wreſtled
with death all the night, not that he
deſired to live, but unwilling to leave
off calling on</hi> Urania, <hi>bleſſed</hi> Urania!
<hi>yet in the morning he was overcome,
reſigning up his breath with her name
in his mouth.</hi> Baſilius <hi>had him ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuouſly
buried, and</hi> Muſidorus cauſed
a famous Monument to be built in
his memorie. On the top of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Sun had fully dried it, there
was found <hi>Philiſides</hi> the deſpairing
Shepherd dead, yet not by other pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
than a deep melancholly that
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:153743:110"/>
over-preſſed his heart: theſe lines
were engraven on a ſtone that lay by
him. Judge not uncharitably; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the expreſsion of a dying man;
No poyſonous draught have I taſted of,
nor any ſelf-murdering inſtruments
have I uſed to ſhorten my miſerable
life: for by the authoritie of the Gods,
the time of my end was concealed from
all but my ſelf. I am ſure it came not
unwiſhed for, for why ſhould I live to
be deſpiſed of her, whom above all the
world I honoured? I will forbear to
name her, becauſe my Rèval ſhall not
triumph in my death, nor yet condemn
me for coveting ſo rare a Perſon. My
ambition is to have the tears of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadian</hi>
Beauties ſhed at my Funeral, &amp;
ſprinkled on my Hearſs; and when my
bodie is ſo magnificently embalmed, let
it be interred with <hi>Claius</hi> two Lovers,
both finiſhing their lives for their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes
ſakes, his is publickly known to
be <hi>Urania,</hi> my Breaſt is the Cabinet
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:153743:111"/>
where mine is fixed, and if you rip that
open, you will find it; though perhaps
not ſo perfect as I could wiſh it were, the
Cabinet melting into tears for its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs.
And now farewel all the
world; and I beſeech the Divine Powers
to bind <hi>Cupids</hi> hands from wounding,
unleſs he have a certain ſalve to cure
them.</p>
            <p>Thus died <hi>Philiſides;</hi> his Will being
faithfully performed by the Princes
and the beauteous Princeſſes, with
<hi>Urania</hi> and other prettie Shepherdeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
needing no imprecations faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
bemoan his death, burying him
with plentie of tears.</p>
            <p>Thus were there Nuptials finiſhed
with ſadneſs. But before the ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
were quite over, there came more
Princes that had partaken of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of <hi>Muſidorus</hi> and <hi>Pyrocle's</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
with Preſents of gratitude for
their Brides, <hi>Pamela</hi> and <hi>Philoclea.</hi>
Then after all Ceremonies accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:153743:111"/>
they retired ſeverally to their
flouriſhing Kingdoms of <hi>Theſſalia</hi>
and <hi>Macedon,</hi> and <hi>Armenia,</hi> with <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi>
where they increaſed in riches,
and were fruitfull in their renowned
Families. And when they had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
participated of the pleaſures
of this world, they reſigned their
Crowns to their lawfull Succeſſours,
and ended their days in Peace and
Quietneſs.</p>
