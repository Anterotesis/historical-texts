         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>

which might be directed to the several persons

<hi>Moses</hi>'s chair to hear and determine, judge and pass
sentence, to <hi>him</hi> that gives a charge to others, in
the first place is <hi>a Charge</hi> given, <hi>Thou shalt judge the
people with just judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>him</hi> that prepares and makes ready the cause
for the Judge's hearing, the <hi>Advocate</hi> or <hi>Pleader</hi> to
whose care and trust the state and suit of the <hi>Client</hi>
is committed, when he speaks in a cause, there's a
caveat for him, <hi>Thou shalt not wrest judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>him</hi> that's returned to serve as a <hi>sworn</hi> man
or <hi>Juror,</hi> in matters of grand or petty inquest; or
that is in any <hi>office</hi> of trust, or <hi>place</hi> of service in, or
about the <hi>Courts,</hi> so as it may come within the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95144:8"/>
verge of his power to do a suitor a courtesie, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
is the next injunction, <hi>Thou shalt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
persons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> to <hi>him</hi> that's bound over to prosecute for
the King in a criminal cause; or that offers himself
as a voluntary <hi>informer</hi> upon some penal <hi>statute,</hi> or
is brought in by process to give publick testimony
upon <hi>Oath;</hi> or comes of good or ill will to
speak a <hi>good</hi> word for, or a <hi>contrary</hi> one against
any person, is the last prohibition, <hi>Take not a
gift;</hi> when he opens his mouth to give witness,
he must not open his hand to receive a gift, <hi>for a
gift doth pervert the words of the righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But because the several corruptions of justice do
often unite in the <hi>same persons,</hi> and as the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher</hi>
observes of moral vertues are concatenated
and linked together in the <hi>same subject,</hi> that the

they rather endeavour an engrossing of all abuses,
than a monopoly of any particular one to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and that by such a complication of them,
they (as Saint <hi>James</hi> speaks in another case) <hi>in
many things offend all,</hi> I shall not be so injurious
to the words, as to imprison them in such nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

            <p>The <hi>first</hi> thing that presents it self to our view,

matters,</hi> he now descends to <hi>civil affairs;</hi> as
before he had taken care for the establishment
of <hi>piety</hi> towards <hi>God,</hi> so here he endeavours the
promotion of <hi>justice</hi> towards <hi>men:</hi> the affairs both
of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> fall under the <hi>Magistrate</hi>'s care
and inspection, he is <hi>custos utriusque tabulae;</hi> both
the Tables of the Law were given <hi>Moses</hi> to be
kept, and though he once in anger broke them, yet
now in zeal he takes care for restoring and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of them. What he here gives in charge &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to others, was the discharging of that which
himself undertook, like <hi>Gideon</hi> to his followers,
or <hi>Caesar</hi> to his souldiers, he bids them do no more,
than what he had done before them. At first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he judged the people by himself, but their
<hi>contentions</hi> growing as <hi>numerous</hi> as their <hi>persons,</hi>
and their strifes as <hi>endless,</hi> as they were <hi>unreasonable,</hi>
that soon became a burden too heavy for his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
alone, <hi>ch. 1. 12. How can I my self alone bear your
cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?</hi> and

he chooses out among the people able men to
perform that task with him, that they might <hi>judge
of the smaller matters, whilst onely the harder causes
were brought unto him;</hi> and what he then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
he again at this second promulgation of

the letters transposed, and justice perverted; the

               <p>And as Judgement is wrested by perverting the
