            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

you from heauen the true bread.
For the bread of God is he that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

downe from heauen, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
lyfe vnto the world.</hi> Through
whiche wordes they breake out
straight into this prayer: <hi>O Lord
geue vs alwayes this bread.</hi> These
wordes they doe not vtter wyth
any good affection, or longing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
to be partakers of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
which are offered vnto all in
Christ Jesu: but rather of a diste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

mynde, drawne into contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
desires, seeking by all meanes
to fil themselues with happinesse,
and yet to jeste and scoffe at the
doctrine of Christ. The thoughtes
of them myndes are made many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
both by these words of Christ:<note place="margin">Joh. 6. 26.</note>
               <hi>Ye seeke me because you eate of the
loaues and were filled:</hi> and also by
theyr owne wordes to the same
effecte,<note place="margin">Joh. 6. 31.</note> where they say: <hi>our fathers
did eate Manna in the wildernesse,</hi>
likewise requiring y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ would

so feede them still by miracle, and
then they would follow him. And
afterward also when Christ had
further taught them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he woulde
in no such sort feede them deintelye
on earth, but if they would eate of
the bread that he would geue they
must renounce such fleshly concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence,
crucify themselues vnto
the worlde, and be with a liuelye
fayth incorporate into hys bodye,
then they shoulde eate of liuing

but they woulde liue as they liste.<note place="margin">Joh 6, 28</note>
They would followe Christ: but
they woulde neyther hunger nor
thirst. They would do the will of
God: but they would not crucifie
theyr affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. They would come
vnto heauen, but they would not
be led by Jesus the poor Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
sonne. Theyr carnall fancies
beguyled them. Their scoffing at
Jesus Christ made their hartes so
blinde: and their desire of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
was nothing but the shew of
their owne folye. Now let vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
by other mens harmes.<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 11.</note> Let
vs not fall after the same example
of disobedience. Yf we bring our
carnall fancies to the worde of
God,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 14.</note> we shall neuer vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it.
The naturall man perceyueth not

grose imaginations deceiued Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus,<note place="margin">Joh: 3, 4.</note>
that he knew not what
it was to be borne a newe.<note place="margin">John. 4, 15</note> Such

<pb facs="tcp:13913:4"/>
of Samaria, that she knew not
howe to aske for the water of lyfe.<note place="margin">Mar, 16. 38.</note>
Such carnal imaginations made
the children of Zebedie to aske of
our Sauyour Christe, they knew
not what.<note place="margin">Luke. 18, 38.</note> Yea all the disciples of
our sauyour Christ, by such fleshly
desires oftentymes vnderstoode
him not. And how muche more
ought we to take heede that haue
so barren hartes, not watered so
ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifully with gods sprite? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall we be led, yf wee bryng
vnto Gods word our sensuall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites?
sure eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thether, whether
these Jewes are gone before vs,
to murmur agaynst Christe, and
despise his crosse. Let vs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take
heede while it is yet tyme, and in
obedience of Gods worde banishe
farre from vs our own vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and yf we will be taught of
the Lord God,<note place="margin">2. Cor, 19.</note> let vs leade into
captiuity all our own cogitations
and seeke no better estate for the
<pb facs="tcp:13913:5"/>
Gospell of God, then he hymselfe
hath appoynted by hys holy wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
Otherwise it will surelye
come vpon vs, that came so long
agone vpon these carnall Iewes,
&amp; wee shall haue so good liking of
our owne delight, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
the poore Galilean, &amp; with
a proude countenaunce wee shall
thinke much scorne, that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters
sonne should bee our may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
This is the fruyte y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> groweth
out of mans wisedome. Here it is
plainely testified in this 6. <hi>of John.</hi>
It is testified in the Scribes and
Pharisies,<note place="margin">Mat. 27.</note> that so often scoffed at
our Sauiour Christ: in the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours
that vppon the Crosse had
him in such derision: in the whole
multitude of the Iewes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> stroke
him and spitte on hym,<note place="margin">Math. 26. 8.</note> &amp; bid hym
areade, who had hurt him. Thus
after that by carnall reason they
woulde needes iudge of Christe,
they grewe more &amp; more in hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb facs="tcp:13913:5"/>
of hart, till they thought it
good wisedome to speake so great
blasphemye. Such Gospellers
there were many in the primitiue
Churche, that thought themselues
wyse in makyng a ieste of Christ.
So Iulianus the Apostata when
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Christians asked helpe agaynst
all theyr iniuryes with mockes
and scoffes hee woulde aske why
they did complayne,<note place="margin">Math 5. 49.</note> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilean
theyr mayster bad them doe
good for euyll: yf any would take
away theyr coate, that then they
shoulde geue him also their cloke.
So, many wicked Magistrates
spoyled the Christians of theyr
monye, and would taunt them
merelye with the saying of theyr
God:<note place="margin">Prudence</note> 
               <hi>Quod Caesaris scis, Caesari da,</hi>
geue that vnto Cesare that thou
knowest is Cesars. Such Gospel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lers
at this day, wee haue a great
many in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> laugh smothly
in their sleeues, at theyr madnes
<pb facs="tcp:13913:6"/>
(as they thinke) that followe so
earnestly y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Gospel.<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>et. 44.</note> So S. Peter
hath borne witnesse generally of
the wicked of all ages: that they
shall thinke it much madnes, that
other will not runne to like effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of riot: but let them alone y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
seeke willingly to goe so farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stray.
This is the time of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioysing.
The daies of repentaunce
are not yet come. When they haue
done with their mocking, them
selues shalbe then mocked at, and
for all their pleasaunt sporting,
they shalbe called to Judgement.</p>
            <p>An other thing I noted vnto
you in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> petition of these Iewes,
&amp; that was a desire of happinesse
which they wished to come vnto:
and in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> middes of their malice,
yet an inward sighing of spirite,
that they might once eate of the
bread of lyfe. They pleased them
selues exceedingly in fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst
Christ, and yet agayne in
<pb facs="tcp:13913:6"/>
remorse of conscience, they wished
to be partakers of eternall lyfe.
And this is that sparkeling of the
grace of god, which is kindled in
the harts of all men,<note place="margin">John. 1. 9.</note> of which S.
John sayth, <hi>that Christ lighteneth
all men that come into this worlde.</hi>
Cayne had this light,<note place="margin">Gene, 4. 13.</note> when the
burden of his sinne seemed so hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy
vnto him, that it could not be
pardoned.<note place="margin">Gene, 27. 38.</note> Esau had this light,
when for losse of his fathers bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
he lifted vp his voyce and
wepte. Pharaoh had this light,
when in remembraunce of all his
plagues he cried at the last:<note place="margin">Exo. 9. 27.</note> 
               <hi>The
Lord is righteous,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exo, 8, 19.</note> 
               <hi>but I and my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are wicked.</hi> The sorcerers of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt,
they had this light, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God
confounded theyr wisedome in a
most vile creature, and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
before Pharaoh: <hi>This is the
finger of God.</hi>

of our Sauyour Christe. in these
wordes: <hi>I am the bread of lyfe, he

               <note place="margin">John. 6. 35</note> 
               <hi>and he that beleueth in me

(dearly beloued) I will note vnto
you, as the text geueth me occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
these three poynts. First who
is the bread of lyfe, then by what
meanes he is eaten, and thyrdly,
what fruite commeth of such su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenaunce.
Who is thys breade,
Christe sheweth in these wordes:
<hi>I am the bread of lyfe.</hi> By what
meanes he is eaten, it is shewed
in these wordes: <hi>He that commeth
vnto me, he that beleeueth in mee.</hi>
What fruyte commeth of it, it is
<pb facs="tcp:13913:10"/>
shewed in these wordes: <hi>he shall
neuer hunger, he shall neuer thyrst.
I am the bread of lyfe.</hi> These words
they signifie thus much, that in
Christe alone we haue life, and all
confidence of saluation must bee
grounded on hym &amp; on none els.
Christ crucifyed is a continuall sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of reconciliation standyng
betweene God &amp; vs, so that what
so euer grace, mercy, and peace is
poured vpon vs by God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it commeth downe through

mercye, thus it is made perfecte:
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a liuely fayth wee looke
through Christ crucified, and so go
with boldnesse vnto the throne of
grace. Thus Christ is called the
bread of lyfe: the foode of our soule

the Lord be praysed, that hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
vs out of the kingdome of

into the light of hys Gospel.
Let vs nowe walke in it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
and confesse Christe alone
to be the bread of lyfe. The second
thing that I noted vnto you in
this aunsweare of our Sauyour
Christ, is: how we do eate of this
bread, &amp; that (I said) was shewed
in these wordes, <hi>he that commeth
vnto me, he that beleeueth in mee.</hi>
To come vnto Christ, to beleue in
<pb facs="tcp:13913:13"/>
Christ, this is to eat Christ, so that
we may wel say as <hi>S. August.</hi>
               <note place="margin">August. tract 25</note> said:
<hi>Quid paras dentes aut ventrem, crede
&amp; manducasti?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Upon the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of John.</note> 
               <hi>It is no neede to prepare
tooth or belly, beleue and thou hast eaten.</hi>
But here (dearlye beloued) I
must first admonish you that thys
place, nor this <hi>vi. Chapter of John.</hi>
is not ment of the Sacrament, as
some popish interpreters haue ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly
told you. The Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
was not yet instituted, nor any
nowe present knewe whether hee
would euer ordaine any such Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of his body &amp; bloud, or no:
So that yf he had spoken thereof,
he had tolde them that, whiche
they coulde not vnderstand. But
this Christ doth, without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
eyther of Sacrament
or no Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. He telleth them
how and by what meanes his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
can be eaten, whether it be in
your inward fayth, when secretly
and with your selfe you feede vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
<pb facs="tcp:13913:14"/>
his body, or whether it be in
outward signe or Sacramente,
which is a helpe of our infirmity,
the more liuelye to tast of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
There is but one &amp; the same
way, neyther to eate his flesh, nor
to drinke his bloude: the whiche
way playnely &amp; expressely here is
deliuered vs by Christe, that wee
neede not to erre except wee will.
And this was Christs great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to prepare the harts of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
that they shoulde not bee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with any manner of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandyng,
when they should
heare in the institution of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
<hi>take, eate, this is my body.</hi>
They are before well instructed,
and they knowe what to beleeue.
The grosse and carnall fancyes of
transubstantiation, coulde not
disquiete them. They knew there
was no way to eate Christe, but to
come vnto hym, nor to drinke his
bloud, but to beleeue in him. And
<pb facs="tcp:13913:14"/>
thus fayth was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more precyous,
the further of his bodely presence
was remoued from them,<note place="margin">Heb, 13.</note> 
               <hi>They
knew faith was the taking hold and
substaunce of things we hoped for,
and the sure apprehension &amp; profe
of thinges that were not seene.</hi> So
that they knewe howe to feede of
hys bodye with great boldnesse to
lift vp theyr soule, and take holde
of his mercy that sitteth in heauen
at the right hande of hys Father.
Whence vndoubtedly all the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
of his passion doe presentlye
flow vpon hys poore children. His
conflictes and agonies with sinne
and condemnation, to set vs free
from Gods wrath &amp; displeasure,
and all his obedience shewed here
in flesh, from his corporall, reall,
and substantiall bodye, commeth
downe vpon vs, to cloth vs wyth
righteousnesse, that wee may bee
found vnblamable before hys fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Thns much y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> disciples well
<pb facs="tcp:13913:15"/>
vnderstoode, and they murmured
not at these wordes, <hi>this is my
body.</hi> Thus muche let vs learne
out of this place against we come
vnto the sacrament, <hi>that to come
vnto Christ &amp; to beleeue in Christ,
that is truely to eate Christ.</hi> Thys
beyng proued true vnto you, you
well soone set your selues free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
all popish idolatry. And how true
it is, marke well, I beseech you,
what are the wordes. <hi>I am sayth
Christ, the bread of lyfe. He that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
vnto me shall not hunger.</hi> Yf
Christe had spoken still properly,
accordyng to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> metaphore, he had
sayd thus: I am the bread of lyfe,
he that eateth me, shall not hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
Now he himself hath said: he
that commeth, in stead of this, he
that eateth, if you will beleue him
you must needes confesse it. To
eate Christe, is to come vnto him.
So in this other sentence. <hi>He that
beleueth in me, shall not thyrst.</hi> If
<pb facs="tcp:13913:15"/>
he had kepte y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> property of speach,
he had sayd thus: he that drinketh
of me shall not thyrst. In stead of,
<hi>drinketh,</hi> he sayth, <hi>beleeueth,</hi> and
therefore it is moste certayne, to
drinke of Christe, is to beleeue in
Christe. So that this is now an

Apostles, <hi>will you also go away?</hi> As
if he should haue sayde, are these
wordes so strange that you also
will be driuen a way? Unto which
Peter aunswered: <hi>Lorde to whom
shall we go, thou hast the wordes of
eternall lyfe, &amp; we beleue and know,
that thou art Christ the sonne of the
liuing Lord.</hi> Loe here, how Saint
Peter himselfe, of whose name the
Pope braggeth so much, and yet
vtterly renounceth hys fayth. S.
Peter (I say) vnderstandeth, all
<pb facs="tcp:13913:16"/>
these wordes of life, of the eating
and drinking of Christes flesh and
hys bloud, he expoundeth them
thus: to beleue in Christe, and to
knowe him to bee the sonne of the
liuing God, euen as Christ hym
selfe had before taught hym: <hi>The
wordes that I speake are spirite aad
life, it is the spirite that quickeneth,
the flesh profiteth nothyng.</hi> If all
this be not playne enough, looke
yet, &amp; let S. John expound hym
selfe. Here Christ sayth: <hi>he that
eateth my fleshe, and drinketh my
bloud dwelleth in me, and I in hym.</hi>
The same S. John that wrote
this,<note place="margin">1. Joh. 4, 15,</note> sayth thus agayne: <hi>Who so
confesseth that Iesus is the sonne of
God, God dwelleth in him, and hee
in God.</hi> Wherby it is playne, he
that confesseth thus of Christ, he
eateth his fleshe and drinketh hys
bloud. This (dearely beloued) is
no newe doctrine but taught by
Christe, receiued by his Apostles,
<pb facs="tcp:13913:17"/>
written for all ages by hys holy
Euangelistes, now preached to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
comfort of all true Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and
in the primitiue Church beleeued
of all the holy Fathers. I would
alledge you theyr owne sayinges
but that the tyme passeth, &amp; you
haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> plentifully set out vnto

witnesses, to know the meaning
of the holy Ghost. And what if
here I should reason out of our
Christes owne wordes to proue,
there can bee no transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He sayth for proofe, that hys

I will come vnto that, that I
thynke you looke for, and whych
the Pope hath made the substance
of all his masses. Christ saith thus:

               <note place="margin">Math. 26. 26.</note> 
               <hi>eate, this is my body.</hi> And
what then? is there any obscuritye
in these wordes? Is it not often

eate is body? are not his disciples
well taught? knew they it not lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
before? As it is playnely said: <hi>this is
my body,</hi> so is it not playnely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
<hi>these wordes are spirite
and lyfe?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 14</note> No man can here be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
but he that is dull of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng,
and hath not harkened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to the wholesome doctrine of
truth. But you will say, why could
<pb facs="tcp:13913:18"/>
not Christ as well haue sayd: this
is a figure, or signe, or token of my
body. I aunswere. Fyrste these
wordes are without dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, that
his disciples should dream of tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiation:
they are so assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taught before how they should
eate or drinke Christ. Then I say,
thys our sauiour Christ did choose
to speake, to shew his great and
aboundaut loue to warde vs, that
wee should be so fully perswaded
that he were our head, &amp; wee his
members, as if hys naturall and
reall body, were substantiallye
within vs, that we should know,
what so euer we could wish from
his mercy to comfort vs, by this
Sacrament or couenaunte of his
mercy wee shoulde so assure our
selues of it, as yf we eate his very
flesh, or drinke his natural bloud.
The like phrases or speaches are
plaine and often in the scripture,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 24</note>
               <hi>Christ is our head, and we his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

As for transubstantiation, it is so
straunge from the sence of the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
that yf the Pope had not
bene, I thinke it neuer had bene
thought of. And yf the Councell of
<hi>Lateranne</hi> had not bene, it had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
bene named. But let vs way
the wordes a litle, and conferre
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with these late popish follies.
Christ sayth,<note place="margin">Math. 26.</note> 
               <hi>take, eate, thys ys my

not, eate not, site a farre of, and
tooke on, fall downe and worship.
<pb facs="tcp:13913:19"/>

of practise, when you came to
the Sacrament, or as you ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <note place="margin">Math. 26.</note> 
               <hi>this is my bloud.</hi> The Pope
vtterly denieth it, &amp; proueth it by

ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be with his bloud: there is
<hi>concomitantia,</hi> the one followeth
the other, and therefore you shal
not drinke it, yet it is his bloud.
<hi>Christ sayth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cor. 11.</note> 
               <hi>as ofte as you doe this,
preach forth the death of the Lorde
vntill he come.</hi> The Pope sayth,
that is not necessary. If you
say Masse dayly, it skilleth litle,
though you preache not once in a
yeare. What maner of vicar call
you this man, that dispenseth his

O (dearely beloued) be not
deceiued. These thinges bee to
playne to be dissembled. It is his
owne mouth that speaketh these
thinges, which (sayth he) can not
erre. Wee know that there is no
truth in hym, and whatsoeuer hee
doth, it is against Christ, and his
eternall Gospell. For the wordes,
<hi>thys is my body</hi> (I trust) I haue
proued it, they be not wordes of
errour, to make you beleeue the
thing that is not: the meaning is
plaine. The bread is a warrant, &amp;
pledge vnto you, that as sure as
you eate it, which is the signe? so
sure your fayth feedeth on all the

your olde leauen of al Romish I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry.
Now a woord or two of
the fruite of eating and drinking
Christ, &amp; so I will make an ende.
To eate and drink Christ, is as I
haue sayd, to come vnto Christ, to
beleeue in Christ, and the fruit of
this is: <hi>he that commeth vnto him,
he shall not hunger.</hi> Againe, <hi>and he
that beleueth in him, shall not thirst
any more.</hi> This (dearly beloued)
is that great fruyt, that vnspea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
benefite, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> endlesse mercye,
which they taste and eate of that
laboure and are loden and come
vnto Christ: My tounge can not
expresse it: your eares ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not heare
it: our hartes can not imagine it,
what is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fulnes of ioy that sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
out of this fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tain. To thirst
no more, to be no more an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred,
<pb facs="tcp:13913:22"/>
is to see God as he is and
to contemne the world, to haue al
teares wiped away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our eyes,
and be no more sorowful, to haue
the glory of God to shine vppon
vs, &amp; no more to regard the light
of Sun or Moone. This shalbe
then perfect, when Christ shal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in glory and maiestie, and
wee shalbe clothed with righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes
and immortality. Now in
