            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

As indeed he propoſeth and ſetteth out nothing in the world, be it in the perſon of kings or of ſuch as be of baſe condition,<note place="margin">For what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes changes do ſerue vs.</note> wherein he meanes not to ſhew that it is hee which ſetteth his hands to all things, that men may learne to depend vpon him, to hope for all good things at his hands, and to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and tremble vnder his iudgements.</p>
            <p>When we ſee an Hiſtorie,<note place="margin">A glaſſe for the comfort of ſuch as be afflicted.</note> that ſome kingdome hath bin eſtabliſhed and brought into good eſtate, which before was diſſipated &amp; diuided: or elſe that ſome man hath bene deliuered from ſome great calamity, and hath recouered ſome prosperitie: behold heere is a glaſſe to let them know which reade ſuch things, what good and happie iſſue they may attend at Gods hands, after long and troubleſome calamities, if they truſt in him. Againe, if we encounter ſuch an example,<note place="margin">A glaſſe for them of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua.</note> that a Common-wealth, which otherwiſe was of no great force to reſiſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enterpriſes attempted against it; yet it ſtandeth fast, only making it ſelfe ſtrong vpon the ſuccours it looked for at Gods hands: behold here a Painter to repreſent vnto vs liuely, with what wiſedome God worketh, breaking the counſels of the proud which abuſe their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to confound and oppreſſe ſuch in the middeſt of which he hath eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed his ſeate to be honoured.</p>
            <p>Moreouer when ſuch witneſſes appeare, as the greatnes, force, magnificence, the long ſpreading &amp; ſtretching of great Monarchies,
<pb facs="tcp:9561:4"/>

            <p>Moreouer, ſo many chaunges and ſtraunge mutations which the diſcourſe of time bringeth vs, do demonſtrate vnto vs what may be the aſſurance and felicitie of all the frame of the world, and what may be the common condition of men.<note place="margin">Things here below ſubiect to changes.</note> As indeed there is nothing ſo well gouerned vnder the Sunne, be it neuer ſo well ordeined and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, which is not ſubiect to diuers chaunges. We ſee the Crownes of kings fall downe to the earth: the ſcepters of Emperours bruiſed, yea broken in pieces; the glory of Common-weales fade and decaie, but ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">The cauſes of changes and mutations.</note> proud ingratitude, inſatiable auarice of ſuch as were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined to rule and acknowledged not God, are the cauſe of ſuch ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes and mutations.</p>
            <p>But ſince all men ſeeke to finde ſome firme estate wherein they may ſubſist &amp; ſtand the reading of ſuch examples ſhould bring them to behold their God who is the firmitie &amp; aſſurance of all things, and without whom,<note place="margin">The alone Church of God remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth firme.</note> nothing can remaine firme one minute of time. And as he hath ſhewed this aſſurance in the middest of his Church againſt all tempests and ſtormes, and against all the aſſaults &amp; machinations of Antichriſts, as is clearly ſhewed in this preſent collection, ſo ſhould this bee the refuge of euery one to finde out that hee would ſeeke for. The Church may well be ſhaken,<note place="margin">The Church may be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but not ouerthrowne.</note> but it can neuer be ouerthrowne: for it leaneth vpon the foundation of the truth of God: It may be toſſed by tempeſts, waues &amp; ſtormes, but her ancre aſcendeth euen to heauen, and is ſure held by the hand of him which cannot be remoued out of his place.<note place="margin">The conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the world.</note> But contrary, men perceiue not the ſtormes and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests which are to ſettle and ſinke the great kingdomes of the world: yet it is ſo, that without being ſhaken they fall &amp; vaniſh away as of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues. But the ſpirituall kingdome of the ſonne of God, which is his Church, ought not to be esteemed after the daungers of this preſent

Thou ſhalt haue no more the Sunne to ſhine by day: neither ſhall the brightneſſe of the Moone ſhine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee: For the Lord ſhall be thine euerlaſting light, and thy God thy glory, and thy Sunne ſhall neuer goe downe, neither ſhall thy Moone be hid: for the Lord ſhall be thine euerlaſting light, and the dayes of thy ſorrow ſhall be ended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The aſſurance then of the Church ought not to be conſidered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording nor in regard of things preſent,<note place="margin">The Church of God is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to change</note> becauſe it is eſtabliſhed in God and feareth no chaunges: For God is her light: ſo that ſhe hath no need to borrow any brightneſſe from either Sunne or Moone. And although the faithfull be not depriued of the commodities of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life, but rather there is nothing either in heauen or earth which God hath not created for the loue of them: ſeeing he hath a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar care of them: yet is there one thing much more excellent which the children of God do enioy; namely the heauenly light: which from all times hath bene cast on it. We must then lift vp our ſpirits vnto God, who gouerneth all both aboue and below,<note place="margin">

               </note> and not attribute any thing to Fortune, as prophane men doo: heereunto men pretend to bring all the faithfull.</p>
            <p>Therefore hither men come not to feede the ſpirit of fooliſh cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie, or here to learne any thing to babble with vaine ostentation, or to take pleaſure to heare a well adorned language: and aſſoone as the eyes are taken from off the booke, all fruite of that reading is lost: but there is neither fact, nor chance, nor iſſue,<note place="margin">Examples of proſperitie.</note> which euery man oght not to borrow for himſelfe. If he finde that ſome vertuous and well liuing man hath bene well beloued of God and honoured of men, that vertue ought to be vnto him as a flame to lighten his heart, that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſuch a man he may come to a like felicitie.<note place="margin">Examples of aduerſitie.</note> If contrary he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter and light on one who for his vices fell into ſome greeuous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences, it is an example to ſerue him for a bridle, that hee do not precipitate and throw himſelfe headlong into the ſame ditch: and aboue all, ſuch as haue great dignities and are called to doo great things, ſo much more as their ruine is daungerous, ſo much more alſo ought they to be carefull to looke how faithfully they acquite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their charge committed vnto them.</p>

See <hi>Ioſephus</hi> in the 14. booke of <hi>Antiq. Chap.</hi> 2. This came in the yeare of the world, 3903. and threeſcore yeares before Chriſt.</p>

               <hi>Augustus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Iulius Caeſars</hi> Siſter, ſucceeded his Vncle beeing adopted of him. Vnder whoſe Empire the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſonne of God was borne, taking fleſh of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in <hi>Bethelem,</hi> a Towne of <hi>Iury,</hi> the yeare of the worlds creation, 3963.</p>
            <p>This is the ſeede which burſt the Serpents head, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vs from the mortall ſting thereof. This is the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne head of the Church, without which the body thereof can haue no forme. He takes a particular care thereof, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his preſence to be there felt with efficacie: And in the middeſt thereof will be inuocated, ſerued, honoured and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. The ſtate whereof is to be deducted in this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>So ſoone as Chriſt the true annointed of God was borne
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:9561:10"/>
and manifeſted in the world, <hi>Herod</hi> ſtirred great perſecution. The occaſion thereof was by the wiſe men which came from the Eaſt, which brought newes of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> to them of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi> He cauſed all the children in the coaſts of <hi>Bethelem</hi> to be ſlaine, which were two yeares old and vnder.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Herod</hi> who obtained of <hi>Augustus</hi> the title and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of King in <hi>Iudea,</hi> was the ſonne of <hi>Antipater</hi> the <hi>Idumeen,</hi> ſonne of an other <hi>Herod</hi> which was a Secretary in the Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> in the Towne of <hi>Aſcalon. Philo</hi> the Iewe rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that in the 13. yeare of his kingdome, he killed the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie Iudges of the houſe of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and ſubſtituted others in their places. Hee was brought into ſuch a rage, that hee made ſley his owne ſonne, which he had of a wife of the line of <hi>Iuda. Macrobius</hi> reciteth, that when <hi>Augustus</hi> heard it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed hee ſaid. It were better to be <hi>Herods</hi> Swine then his Sonne.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Behold the iudgement of God.</note>His execrable deeds remained not long vnpuniſhed, and it is profitable we ſhould knowe the iſſue worthie of ſuch a Tyrant. <hi>Ioſephus</hi> in the 8. booke of <hi>Antiq. Chap.</hi> 17. deſcribeth it thus. The kings maladie encreaſed, and God ſhewed openly that he would puniſh his impietie. For he was burned with a ſlowe heat, yet without, none could perceiue it, only he felt it within, becauſe it grated &amp; waſted his entralles. He was ſo hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry that he tooke no leiſure to chawe his meate, but deuoured all that entred into his mouth: and ſo ſtill ſome muſt caſt meat into his mouth. His entralls were wounded and vlcerated, and he was tormented with collicke paſſions. His feete were ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with flegmaticke humours, through which you might ſee the day. His ſhamefaſte parts were rotted and full of wormes: his breath was ſtinking that none durſt approach vnto him. And in the 21. Chap. of the firſt booke of the Iewes warres, the ſame Hiſtoriographer writeth thus. All his bodie was taken with a diſeaſe, and hee was tormented with diuers do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. He had a burning and intollerable heate in him. The Chollick tormented him inceſſantly: his feete were ſwelled betwixt the skinne and the fleſh: he ſought to aduance his owne death; and calling for a knife lifted vp his right hand,

but <hi>Archilaus</hi> his coſen-germane perceiuing it,<note place="margin">Tiberius.</note> ranne to him and held his hand: hee died 5. dayes after he made his ſonne <hi>Antipater</hi> die, hauing enioyed the kingdome the ſpace of 34. yeares after he had cauſed <hi>Antigonus</hi> to die, and 37. yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hee was declared King by the Romanes. In all other things he was happie, yea if euer King were; for a man of ſo baſe condition to acquire that Kingdome and keepe it ſo long a time, and at laſt leaue it to his children. But concerning his domeſticke affaires, none could be more vnluckie, &amp;c. Hitherto <hi>Ioſephus.</hi>

               <hi>This Hiſtorie is worthie of memorie, that all that read ſuch a vengeance of God, may learne to feare his iudgements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the death of this <hi>Herod,</hi> the Iewes not being able to ſupport the ruling of a ſtraunger, ſought to raiſe vp ſeditions, but they were repreſſed by <hi>Archilaus.</hi>

            <p>The ſame yeare the Iewes endured great afflictions. One was at <hi>Alexandria</hi> vpon this occaſion. <hi>Caligula</hi> had ordained
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:9561:12"/>
that through all the Iuriſdiction of the Romanes, there ſhould be builded vnto him Temples and Aultars, where they ſhould worſhip him as God. The Iewes alone reſiſted his impietie. Then were there many Grecians in <hi>Alexandria</hi> who wiſhed death vnto the Iewes, therefore then they tooke occaſion to make them odious vnto the Emperour except they obeyed his ordinance. When it came to proofe, the Iewes reſiſted it ſtrongly, and the ſedition about it was ſuch, that many were ſlaine on both ſides. The cauſe was finally debated at <hi>Rome:</hi> and <hi>Caligula</hi> a peruerſe man made chaſe away <hi>Philo</hi> the Iewe, who pleaded the Iewes cauſe.

            <p>The Iewes alſo were greatly affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in <hi>Babilon</hi> of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and in <hi>Seleucia</hi> of <hi>Siria.</hi>

            <p>Ieſus Chriſt aſcended viſibly into Heauen to confirme his Reſurrection the better, and the glorie of his Kingdome, 40. dayes after his Reſurrection. His Diſciples yet dreamed of an earthly kingdome of <hi>Meſſias,</hi> &amp; asked of him if he would not begin it. But Ieſus Chriſt after he had ſpoken of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Kingdome and had bleſſed them, was lifted vp aloft, and a bright Cloude receiued him into Heauen, where he ſitteth at the right hand and power of God.</p>
            <p>Now then we muſt conſider what aduancements and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Primitiue Church made by the Apoſtles and their Diſciples; that all the faithfull may know that Ieſus Chriſt the King of glory remaineth not Idle in Heauen: but by an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable

manner maintained, gouerneth, and aydeth his, that his Goſpell may be ſowne through the world.</p>
            <p>But as God ſhewed that honour to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as to giue it the promiſes touching the Redeemer, ſo there alſo by his death he obtained ſaluation vnto mankinde.<note place="margin">Churches in Aſia the leſſe.</note> Aboue all Countries <hi>Aſia</hi> the leſſe had at that time the moſt flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing Churches.

            <p>Tenne dayes after the Aſcenſion, was the Feaſt of Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt.

            <p>
               <hi>Saul</hi> (which is alſo <hi>Paul</hi>) was choſen to perſecute the faithfull: for before his conuerſion he burnt with falſe zeale, eſpying into each houſe, and drawing into priſon all he could catch.

            <p>Soone after the Lord reuenged the death of his. For it happened that this <hi>Herode</hi> went to <hi>Ceſarea.</hi> The cauſe was for that hee hadde enterpriſed a warre againſt the <hi>Tyrrians</hi> and <hi>Sidonians,</hi> which they preuented by gaining the Chamberlaine <hi>Blastus,</hi> and demaunding of a peace. One day <hi>Herode</hi> ſumptuouſly adorned ſate downe in Throne and ſpake to them, and the people made an acclamation as if GOD himſelfe hadde ſpoken vnto them. But <hi>Herode</hi> was incontinently ſtrooken by the Angell of the Lorde, and was conſumed with vermine and died miſerably, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee yeelded no glorie vnto God, and ſo the perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ceaſed.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Aboue all, the Church of <hi>Antioche</hi> was moſt famous, where the Diſciples were firſt called Chriſtians. Some ſay this was the thirtie and eight yeare after Chriſt: others fortie. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> remained there one whole yeare. <hi>Acts.</hi> 11. and 13.</p>

            <p>The yeare fortie foure as many thinke, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and gouerned that Church twentie and fiue yeares: but hardly can they ſhewe that he was at any time there, nor at what time, nor vnder what Emperour. For firſt, if Saint <hi>Peter</hi> were at <hi>Rome,</hi> he came not to <hi>Rome</hi> at the time they ſay: namely in the yeare fortie foure, after the Natiuitie of our Lord Ieſus, and that which they ſay, that hee ruled the Church twentie and fiue yeares, hath no likelihood. For it may eaſily be gathered from the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galath.</hi> that hee was in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> the yeare 51. where the Apoſtles great Councell was held. Let the yeares be numbred. The yeare thirtie and fiue S. <hi>Paul</hi> was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted, to which adde ſeuenteen, euen vntill that Councell, and it comes to fiftie and two. How could he then before ſeuen yeares bee at <hi>Rome?</hi> If hee were there he returned ſoone. But S. <hi>Luke</hi> then would not haue concealed it if it had beene ſo: neither is it found in any Hiſtorie of credit, that after Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was entred <hi>Rome,</hi> hee left that place to returne into the Towne of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> Moreouer it is certaine he was not at <hi>Rome</hi> the yeare fiftie eight, and three ſcore. And that it is ſo, when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was ledde thither priſoner, he remained there in an hyred houſe two yeares. Heereof Saint <hi>Luke</hi> makes no mention of Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> And by the ſecond Epiſtle to <hi>Timothie,</hi> it may be plainely knowne that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was not at <hi>Rome</hi> at the time that S. <hi>Pauls</hi> death was ſo nie. For then S. <hi>Paul</hi> hauing occaſion to make mention of all that was with him, would not haue forgotten Saint <hi>Peter</hi> if hee hadde beene there.</p>

               <p>A Philoſopher who by no Arguments could be ſurmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was finally conuerted by a ſimple Biſhop, who ſaid vnto him: Harken Philoſopher, there is one God which made all things in the power of his word, and by the ſanctification of his holy ſpirite confirmed them.

So by this meanes for a certaine time were the Emperours kept from the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pope.

Into which office being brought, ſhee beſtowed holy orders (as they call them) after the maner of other Popes: ſhee made Prieſts and Deacons: ſhe ordained Biſhops and Abbots: ſhe ſung Maſſes: ſhee conſecrated Temples and Aultars: ſhee adminiſtred the Sacraments: ſhee preſented her feete to kiſſe; and did all other things which the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> vſed to do, and yet her Actes were then of verie litle or no valew.</p>

                  <hi>Heere thou mayeſt ſee (Reader) how the Romane Church cannot erre, after they haue cauſed a Maſſe of the holy Ghoſt to bee ſung.

               <p>But to the end that Popes and annointed Fathers may ſeeme to deteſt ſuch a ſinne, they turne from that ſtreete, as from a place which they much ſuſpect, becauſe of the euil luck. <hi>Func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> makes no doubt ſo ſay that this was permitted of God, that this woman ſhould be created Pope: and withall, that ſhe ſhould be an harlot publikely prooued, becauſe in theſe times ſhe made kings ſubiects vnto her, (as <hi>Ethelwolphus</hi> and <hi>Alfredus</hi> were in England) that they might acknowledge Antichriſt for their king. For God in this <hi>Papeſſe</hi> harlot would manifeſt to the world this whore of <hi>Babilon,</hi> whereof the holy Ghoſt hath foretold, to the ende the faithfull I might take heed of her.

Father and Lord, after I knew thy Decrees made vpon the ſinglenes of Prieſts, lately brought vnto mee, to be farre from diſcretion, a feare vexed me with a ſadneſſe.

               <p>On the other ſide, heauineſſe and compaſſion moued me: For I ſee not by what meanes the members can be guarded, when the head is deteined with ſo greeuous a maladie.

But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> you may vnderſtand that ſuch who know not what a vow mean, are not to be violently compelled thervnto, hear what the Apoſtle ſaith vnto <hi>Timothy.

And this wife how ſhee is wont to be bleſt of the Prieſt you vnderſtand ſufficiently I ſuppoſe by the decrees of holie <hi>Silueſter</hi> the Pope.<note place="margin">This decree is contrarie to the Biſhops and Prelates in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes.</note> To theſe and ſuch other holy ſentences of the ſcripture, agreeth alſo he, that is the writer of the Rule of the Cleargie, writing after this maner. A Clarke muſt be chaſte and continent, or elſe let him be coupled in the bands of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie, hauing one wife. Whereby it is to be gathered, that the Biſhoppe and Deacon are noted infamous and reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, if they be diuided in moe women then one: Otherwiſe if they doo forſake one, vnder the pretence of Religion, both they together, as well the Biſhop as the Deacon, be there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Canonicall ſentence, which ſaith; Let no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop or Prieſt forſake his owne wife, vnder the colour and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Religion: If he do forſake her, let him be excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate: and if he ſo continue, let him be diſcharged. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alſo a man of diſcreet holineſſe, ſaith in theſe words; There is no offence ſo great or greeuous, but it is to auoyd a greater euil. Furthermore we reade in the ſecond booke of the Tripartite Hiſtorie, that when the Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> going about to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the ſame decree, would needs enact, that Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons, after their conſecration, either ſhould abſtaine vtterly from their owne wiues, or elſe ſhould be depoſed: Then <hi>Pathuntius</hi> (one of the holy Martyrs of whome the Emperour <hi>Maximus</hi> had put out the right eye &amp; hockt his legges) riſing vp amongſt them, withſtood their purpoſed decreement, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing marriage to be honourable, and calling the bed of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony chaſtitie: and ſo perſwaded the Councell from making that lawe; declaring thereby what occaſion might come of it to themſelues, and their wiues, of fornication. And thus much did <hi>Pathuntius</hi> being vnmarried himſelfe, and the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell commending his ſentence gaue place thereto, and left the matter free without compulſion, to the will of euery man, to do therein as he thought good. Notwithſtanding there be ſome
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:9561:134"/>
which gatte S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> for their defence in this matter, whoſe temeritie I laugh at, and ignorance I lament: For they know not being ignorantly deceiued, how daungerous the decree of this hereſie was, being made of S. <hi>Gregorie,</hi> who afterward well reuoked the ſame with condigne fruite of repentance. For vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a certaine day as he ſent to his Fiſh-poole for Fiſh,<note place="margin">More then 6000. heads of Infants found in the Popes Moate, through the wicked decree Of the ſingle life of Prieſts.</note> and did ſee more then ſixe thouſand Infants heads which were brought vnto him out of the ſame Ponde or Moate, did greatly repent himſelfe of the Decree before made touching the ſingle life of Prieſts, which hee confeſſed to be the cauſe of that ſo lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table a murther: And ſo purging the ſame with hartie repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, altered againe the things hee had decreed before, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending that Councell of the Apoſtle which ſaith; <hi>That it is better to marrie then to burne.</hi> Adding moreouer himſelfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto and ſaying; <hi>It is better to marrie then giue occaſion of death.</hi> Peraduenture if thoſe men had red with me this which ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, I thinke they would not be ſo raſh in their dooing and iudging, fearing at the leaſt the Lords commaundement: <hi>Doo not iudge that ye be not iudged.</hi> And S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith; <hi>Who art thou that iudgeſt an other mans ſeruant? Either hee ſtandeth or falleth to his owne maiſter, but he ſhall ſtand, for the Lord is mightie and can make him ſtand.</hi> Therefore let your holineſſe ceaſe to compell and enforce thoſe whom only you ought to admoniſh, leaſt through your owne priuate commaundement (which God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid) you be found contrary, as well to the old Teſtament as the new.

Such as haue them, preſume not too much vpon them: For I ſay to haue them is not damnation, but if you preſume vpon them, it is damnation. If for the hauing of them, ye ſhall ſeeme great in your owne ſight, or if you do forget the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of man through the excellencie of any thing you haue, vſe therein due diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therefore, tempered with moderation: which cup of diſcretion is drawne out of that fountaine of the Apoſtolicke preaching which ſaith: Art thou looſe from thy wife? do not ſeeke to thy wife: Art thou bound to thy wife? do not ſeeke to be looſed from her. Where alſo it followeth; Such as haue wiues, let them be as though they had them not. And they that vſe the world, let them be as not vſing it. Item, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the widow he ſaith; Let her marry to whom ſhe will, only the Lord.<note place="margin">What it is to marry in the Lord.</note> To marry in the Lord, is nothing elſe but to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt nothing in contracting of Matrimony, which the Lord doth forbid. <hi>Ieremie</hi> ſaith alſo, Truſt not to the words of lies, ſtaine not the Temple of the Lord. The which ſaying of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie, Hierome</hi> expounding ſaith thus. This may agree alſo and be applied to ſuch virgins as bragge and vaunt of their virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with an impudent face, pretending chaſtitie, when they haue an other thing in their conſcience. And knowe not how the Apoſtle defineth the virgin, that ſhe ſhould be holy in bodie, and alſo in ſpirit.<note place="margin">What a virgin is after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle.</note> For what auaileth the chaſtitie of the bodie, if the minde inwardly be deflowred?

               <p>Hiſtories recite at length how the Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> was handled by <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> who ſucceeded him, and how finally he detained him in great miſeries, after hee had beene beaten and outraged of him. And after this time <hi>Hildebrand</hi> retained to himſelfe all the reuenewes of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; aſſembled great ſummes of ſiluer. After then that <hi>Alexander</hi> was dead, vnder the miſerable ſeruitude of <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> the yeare of our Lord, 1074. the ſame day at night he was Inthronized in the Papall ſeate by his ſouldiers, without the conſent of the Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie or people, leaſt if he had tarried too long, an other had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented him. In his election none of the Cardinalls had ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. Wherevnto when the Abbot of <hi>Clugny</hi> was come, <hi>Hilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand</hi> ſaid vnto him: Thou haſt tarried too long brother. The Abbot anſwered. And thou <hi>Hildebrand</hi> haſt made too much haſte, that occupieſt the Apoſtolike ſeate againſt the Canons, before the Pope thy Lord be buried.</p>
               <p>But how <hi>Hildebrand</hi> was put in poſſeſſion, in what maner he liued, how he drew Cardinalls to him which ſhould be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of his life and doctrine, how miſerably hee tormented them, and with what hereſies he infected the world, what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries, what great treaſons he committed, hardly can many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them.

               <p>Hauing abandoned the Monaſterie of <hi>Clugny,</hi> where hee
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:9561:160"/>
was a Monke, and being come to <hi>Rome,</hi> he inſinuated himſelfe into the familiaritie of <hi>Laurence</hi> an Archprieſt, of whom hee learned Magike Arts and Negromancie: which Arts the ſaid <hi>Laurence</hi> being yet young, had learned of that diuelliſh Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Sylueſter,</hi> Pope, ſecond of that name, with certaine others. There was a certaine particular intelligence betwixt this <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Thoaphilacte, Iohn Gratian,</hi> and <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> all Archprieſts or Cardinalls of the Sinagogue of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Archprieſts &amp; Cardinalls.</note> Wherfore <hi>Hildebrand</hi> did whatſoeuer he would with <hi>Theophilacte,</hi> whileſt hee was in the Popes office, vnder the name of <hi>Benet</hi> the ninth. But which is more, vntill he came to be Pope, nothing was done vnder the other Popes but at his pleaſure. When hee liſt (as <hi>Benno</hi> ſaith) he would ſhake his skirtes, and fire would come out like ſparkes: and by ſuch miracles he abuſed the eyes of ſimple people, as if it had bene ſome ſigne of ſanctetie. And therefore ſaith <hi>Benno,</hi> when the diuell could not perſecute publikely Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt by the Painims, he diſpoſed himſelfe fraudulently to deſtroy his name by that falſe Monke, vnder the ſhewe and colour of religion.</p>
               <p>Authors rehearſe that this <hi>Hildebrand</hi> poyſoned ſeuen or eight Popes, by the ſeruice of <hi>Gerard Brazut,</hi> to the ende by that meanes he might the ſooner come vnto the Papacie. Yet during thoſe great troubles, he handled all things ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly, that none doubted he by any meanes aſpired to the ſeate. And although he was not Pope by name, yet in effect he was the Organe and onely Inſtrument of him that was ordained Pope, or of all his wicked inuentions: and by litle and litle, he practiſed vnder the other Popes, that which he executed in his owne Popedome. This notable Hypocrite vnder the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Canons, and a certaine pietie, hee did whatſoeuer hee would, although he was the moſt vniuſt and the wickeddeſt in the world. He accuſed <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſecond his Lord and Maiſter, becauſe he had ſought ſuccours and helpe of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour againſt his aduerſaties: and ſaid it was not reaſonable (according to Canons) that he ſhould enioy the Papall digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which had demaunded ſuccours of a prophane Prince.

him, and cauſed him ſecretly to die, and incontinently vſurped the Papall ſeate, whileſt men prepared for the obſequies and funeralls of the dead. He communicated his ſiluer and counſell with <hi>Brazut,</hi> and certaine Iewes his familiars, by the meanes of which, he found many tongues at his hire, which cried with an high voyce (yea euen before <hi>Alexander</hi> was buried) S. <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle hath choſen <hi>Hildebrand:</hi> and they placed him in the Papall Chaire vnder the name of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 7.<note place="margin">The 1000. yeare after the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Ieruſalem.</note> And this was done the 1000, yeare after the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> In the which yeare the 6.

But the more he commanded them, the more inflamed he their
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:9561:161"/>
curioſitie diligently to ſeeke the ſecrets thereof. As then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, they had opened the booke, and had curiouſly read the diuelliſh commaundements of that Art, ſuddenly the Angells of Sathan preſented themſelues: the multitude of which, and the horror of them, brought thoſe two young men almoſt out of their wits, that with much adoo could they come to themſelues. And as they themſelues rehearſed it, thoſe euil ſpirits inſiſted ſtrongly, ſaying. Wherefore haue you called vs? wherefore haue you diſquietted vs?

               <p>They then thus terrified, trembling &amp; almoſt out of breath, ſcantly could come to <hi>Rome</hi> vnto their maiſter. Behold what <hi>Benno</hi> ſaith, who was in that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gregorie</hi> being come to the papall dignitie, began inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently to ſollicite that the Canons which his predeceſſors had made by his cautelous Councell, touching Simonie and ſingleneſſe of life in Prieſts and Monkes, ſhould be obſerued: not to the end hee might wholy aboliſh the wicked and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable marchandiſe which was made of Eccleſiaſticall Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices: but that vnder ſome colour of honeſtie, hee might take from Princes the power to conferre and beſtow them, and to the end that by that meane all Biſhops might be reduced and brought vnder the power and authoritie of the Romane ſeate; which becauſe of the right of Inueſture, were obliged and beholding vnto Princes, more then vnto the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> And although that the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> were the greateſt of all Princes, yet this arrogant and proud marchant iudged it beſt,<note place="margin">A Councell at Rome.</note> firſt to touch and deale with him tragically for the cauſe of Simonie. Hee aſſembled a Councell at <hi>Rome</hi> in the place of <hi>Laterane,</hi> touching theſe things: but the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour beeing hindered becauſe of his warres, could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to debate his right in the Sinode. The Pope notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:9561:161"/>
had taken the matter ſo at heart, that for that cauſe he ceaſed not to vſe both treaſons and murders, and that more is, he ſtirred in many places inteſtine and inward warres, which engendred all maner of calamities. For firſt he laide ambuſhes for the Emperour, hee ſought by diuers meanes to cauſe him to die. In ſo much as hee ſought to haue ſlaine him euen in the Church as he ſhould be at his prayers.</p>
               <p>The Cardinall <hi>Benno</hi> rehearſeth thus the Hiſtorie. The Emperour (ſaith he) had a cuſtome often to goe make his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Church of S. <hi>Marke,</hi> in the Mount <hi>Auentine.</hi> As then, <hi>Hildebrand</hi> enquired diligently by certaine ſpies,<note place="margin">What treaſon is there that Popes will not excogitate?</note> of all that he did: hee gaue charge to marke the place wherein the Emperour prayed oftneſt either ſtanding or on his knees, and ſuborned one, promiſing him a great ſumme of money, to lay great ſtones on the beames or vpper lofts of the Church (ſee the holy councell of this Pope) and that he ſhould lay the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo wel, that when the Emperour ſhould make his prayers, he might let them fall on his head to daſh out his braines. But as he which had enterpriſed ſuch a villanie, was at hand to accompliſh it, and went about to handle and remoue a ſtone, the heauie for him, the ſtone by the waight deceiued him: and the ſcaffold which was on the beames being broken, the ſtone and the poore mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable man, by a iuſt iudgement of God, fell vpon the paue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Temple, &amp; was all burſt with the ſame ſtone. After the Romanes vnderſtood how all things was paſt, they bound the feet of that wicked villaine, and by the ſpace of 3. daies trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him through the ſtreets of the towne. But vſing their accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed humanitie, commaunded he ſhould be buried.</p>
               <p>The ſonne of <hi>Benno</hi> ſaith here yet further: that <hi>Iohn</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Port,</hi> who was <hi>Hildebrands</hi> Secretarie and great fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, comming into the Pulpit which was in S. <hi>Peters</hi> Church, ſaid amongſt many other things, in the hearing of the people and Cleargie, <hi>Hildebrand</hi> hath done ſuch a thing, and we alſo as deſeruers, ſhould all bee burned aliue:<note place="margin">The Hoſt caſt into the fire by <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ſeuenth.</note> meaning to giue to vnderſtand that which hee had done of the Sacrament of the body of our Lord.

               <p>

Being before the gate of the Citie (ſayth <hi>Benno</hi>) from morning till night, without hauing eyther meate or drinke, in apparell of cloath, and barefooted, beeing made a ſpectacle for Angels and men, hee required pardon in all humilitie.

The Abbot of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſperge,</hi> called <hi>Conrade de Lihtenaw,</hi> addeth this in his Chronicle.

In ſuch ſort, that that great Citie which is ſpiritually called <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Egipt:</hi> that is to ſay, the Romane Church, was made after this time, a true <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Egipt,</hi> his buggeries and Idolatries.</p>
               <p>In the meane time he mooued maruellous tragedies in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talie, France, Almaine,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Troubles on all ſides ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Pope.</note> which would be too long to rehearſe in this place; and ſuch dealing diſpleaſed many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and wiſe men which were in that time. For to ſpeake nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>England</hi> nor <hi>Italie,</hi> as well in <hi>Almaine</hi> as in <hi>France,</hi> there was 24. Biſhops and more, which together with their Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie were married, and defended, and conſtantly maintained their marriage.</p>
               <p>He commaunded Clarkes to vow ſinglenes, that is to ſay, not to marry: briefly, the moſt tiranically that could be, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad Prieſts marriages, commanding them to leaue theyr wiues; or otherwiſe to be depriued of their offices &amp; prebe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds.

orders, vnleſſe he firſt promiſe and vowe chaſtitie.</p>
               <p>Alſo he ordained that none ſhould heare Maſſe of a Prieſt that had a concubine.</p>
               <p>He forbad Monkes to eate fleſh at any time. <hi>De conſec. diſt.</hi> 5. <hi>c. Carinum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He commanded that no Chriſtian ſhould eat fleſh on the Saterday. <hi>De conſec. diſt.</hi> 5. <hi>Carinum.</hi> 36.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why doo not Monkes obſerue that commaundement as well as they pretend to obſerue their vow of chastitie? For they are for like power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ordained the offering of the Maſſe.</p>
               <p>He Canonized one named <hi>Liberius</hi> an Arrian, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded his Feaſt ſhould be celebrated, as <hi>Benno</hi> witneſſeth. He commanded tenthes ſhould be paid to Prieſts. And tooke from the King of <hi>Poloigne</hi> his Crowne, interdicting his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Hee condemned the opinion of <hi>Berengarius</hi> touching the Sacrament, &amp; was the firſt they ſay, that preached <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation.</hi> He condemned as ſacriledge, a Lay-man poſſeſſing Tithes. Him that gaue Inueſtures of Benefices, as an heretike: and he that receiued them of a Lay-man, as an Idolater.

                  <hi>Peter Waldo</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Lions,</hi> beganne by litle and litle in this time to cleare the thicke darkneſſe therof: and this was as a firſt and litle beginning of the Inſtauration of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an doctrine and religion.</p>
               <p>The Hiſtorie is this. In the Towne of <hi>Lions,</hi> as many of the chief of the Towne in Sommer time to recreate themſelues and talke together, one amongſt them ſuddenly fell downe dead in the preſence of others; amongſt which was this <hi>Waldo,</hi> a rich man, who more then all other men was mooued and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed with feare,<note place="margin">Sudden death giueth occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to <hi>Waldo.</hi>
                  </note> and an apprehenſion of the humane frailtie, and began to think (the ſpirit of God drawing him) more near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to repencance, and to meditate true pietie more then euer hee had done before. He began then to giue much more almes, to open his houſe to all, and to ſpeake of penance and true pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to ſuch as for any cauſe came vnto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:9561:180"/>
                  <hi>This feare was of God,<note place="margin">Note here the diuerſitie of examples.</note> the fruite and the ende ſheweth it in this perſon. But the feare that moued <hi>Bruno</hi> to ſeeke reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and comfort to his fancie without the word of the Lord, was of the diuel, and proceeded of his illuſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This liberalitie drew many poore and needfull people vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, that they came by troupes, and he alwaies expounded ſome place of holy ſcripture in the vulgar tongue: for hee was a man learned (as the writings of that time witneſſe, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of the witneſſes of the truth) the Biſhop of the place, and the Prelates which carried the keyes as they ſay, and would neither enter, nor let others enter, beganne to murmure that a Laie man, or ſecular man (as they call them) ſhould handle or declare in the vulgar tongue the ſcripture, and make aſſemblies in his houſe: admoniſhing to ceaſe to do ſo vnder the paine of excommunication. But for all this, the zeale that <hi>Waldo</hi> had to aduance the glory of God, and the deſire the little ones had to learne, was nothing diminiſhed: but contrary, the reſiſtance and tyrannie of the Prelates gaue occaſion to diſcouer the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and ſuperſtitions of the Romane ſeate, which then were as it were hid in darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The like happened in our time: for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pope &amp; his Prieſts could not endure that <hi>Martin Luther</hi> ſhould reprehend their Indulgences, they were the cauſe that a further ſearch was made into their errours, and ſo diſcouered their abhominable blaſphemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Waldo</hi> now gathered in the vulgar tongue many places out of the auncient Fathers,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Waldo</hi> ſtrengtheneth himſelfe with places of the Doctors.</note> to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme and ſtrengthen ſuch as were of his ſide, not only by the authoritie of holy ſcriptures, but alſo by witneſſe of Doctors, againſt the aduerſaries. It is likely to be true, by Hiſtoriographers, yea euen by the writings of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, that this aſſembly endured certaine time (it may be foure or fiue yeares) that <hi>Waldo</hi> taught in the Towne of <hi>Lyons,</hi> before he was driuen to exile &amp; baniſhment. For becauſe he was mightie and had friends, he was not ſo ſoone expoſed to daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which afterward were laide for him. And thus came the

               <p>This good Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> aſſembled at <hi>Francford</hi> all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors, Dukes, Biſhops, Counts, and all ſuch as were thought cunning, as well in humane ſciences as diuine, and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all, by publike and ſolemne proclamation, hee gaue new authoritie to the auncient Lawes,<note place="margin">King of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, and Emperor.

So that if there had wanted but one farthing leſſe then the ſaid tenne ſoules, they ſaid all could profit nothing.

               <p>This <hi>Paul</hi> was an Aſtrologian, a Magician, and Diuine, and amongſt his moſt familiars, had one called <hi>Denis Seuila</hi> a Magician, whom therefore afterward hee made a Cardinall, with one named <hi>Gaurice</hi> of <hi>Portugall, Cecius</hi> and <hi>Marcell</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gromancians and wicked villaines: Of theſe did hee enquire the fortune of himſelfe and his baſtards. He got his red hatte in this maner. Hee had a ſiſter called <hi>Iulia Farneſe,</hi> which hee deliuered to Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> that hee might be a Cardinall and Biſhop of <hi>Hostia,</hi> and to finde meanes to pay his debts.
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:9561:269"/>
For thoſe good Popes commonly are ſo inflamed with whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that they make no difficultie to promiſe redde hats and Biſhopprickes to ſuch as will bring them their ſiſters, or elſe that which is more horrible, their young bretheren, to violate. Many by ſuch practiſes obtaine great riches, &amp; fatte Benifices. And (as <hi>Agrippa</hi> ſaith) there is no ſhorter way then that to come therevnto.</p>
               <p>This murderer poyſoned his mother and a Nephewe, to this end that all the ſucceſſion of the <hi>Farneſes,</hi> might fall vpon him. Moreouer ſeeing the other of his ſiſters (whoſe carnall company he had ſometime had) followed too openly the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and conditions of them of the houſe of <hi>Farneſe,</hi> and that ſhee loued more the company of others, then his, hee poyſoned her alſo.</p>

For hee counterfeited and diſguiſed himſelfe, feigning to bee one of the Gentlemen of the Legates houſe, ſo vnder the colour of a promiſe to marrie her, deflowred her: Who after ſhee knew the truth what hee was, and that ſhee was not his legitimate wife, but his whore (at the leaſt by the Canon lawe) ſhee became al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt out of her wittes. And of this marriage came that great Porteenſeigne and Captaine of all Buggerers and Sodomites. <hi>Peter Lewis.</hi>

For ſhee knowing that the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar vertues of <hi>Mustapha</hi> were ſo contrary vnto her, and that as long as hee liued ſhee ſhould neuer haue reſt (for that hee had obtained the loue of the people of warre, and that all mens eyes were vppon him, for the great hope they had of his excellent courage and ſingular dexteritie) therefore ſought ſhee to make him odious vnto <hi>Soliman.</hi> Wherevnto her ſonne in lawe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aided her, becauſe he gouerned all affaires. Her reaſon was, that <hi>Mustapha</hi> truſted ſo much in the loue and fauour which he had obtained of all men, by a great liberalitie, hardineſſe and valiancie, that he burnt with ſuch luſt and deſire to raigne: that euery one feared that in affecting the Empire, hee would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance the dayes of <hi>Soliman:</hi> as <hi>Selim</hi> had before done to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Therefore ſhee incited <hi>Soliman,</hi> and beſought him with teares and lamentations, to take order and prouide for his ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And although that from the beginning ſhe had profited lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and that <hi>Muſtapha</hi> had diſcouered her impoiſonments and ambuſhes which ſhe laid for him ordinarily: yet left ſhe not to continue it, with the helpe of a Iew, a renowmed Enchantreſſe: who hauing giuen her certaine drugges, ſhee cauſed the loue of <hi>Soliman</hi> towards <hi>Roze</hi> to redouble: Inſomuch that ſhe aſſured her ſelfe to end her purpoſes, though it were long firſt.</p>
               <p>Finally, after many practiſes, ſhe found meanes to ſuborne <hi>Mustapha</hi> his gouernor, and cauſed him to write (though falſly) vnto <hi>Soliman,</hi> that his ſaid ſonne would marry the daughter of the King of <hi>Perſia.</hi> This old man ſtirred, yea tyred with the continuall complaints of <hi>Roze</hi> and <hi>Roſtan,</hi> eaſily beleeued

theſe newes and aduertiſements.

               <p>

And therefore the Pope had giuen him expreſſe charge that he ſhuld ſuffer nothing to be done in the Councell which tended to the detriment of the Romane ſeat. But that he ſhould driue out all ſuch as enterpriſed any ſuch like thing.</p>
               <p>Therfore as one in the ſaid Councel called <hi>Iames Nachiantes,</hi> Biſhop of a place called <hi>Foſſa Clodia,</hi> ſaid that he could not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Decree, where it was written that traditions ought to be receiued and obſerued with like reuerence as the Goſpell: <hi>Ceruin</hi> cauſed him to be throwne out of the Councell.

               <p>About this time <hi>Peter Paul Vergerius,</hi> was come from <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi> to <hi>Trent,</hi> who had many times beene an Embaſſador in <hi>Almaine</hi> for the Popes affaires: but becauſe men held him ſuſpected in ſome things to accord with the Almaines: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the two other Legates, namely, <hi>Pol</hi> and <hi>de Monte,</hi>

               <p>Many Biſhops vnderſtanding this of <hi>Vergerius,</hi> determined to haue written vnto the Pope, to admoniſh him not to ſuffer this: becauſe then many would ſay that that Councel was not free,<note place="margin">Ierome Vida Cremona.</note> from which Biſhops were put backe. <hi>Hierome Vida de Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alba,</hi> &amp; an excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Poet, had alreadie indigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Letters, as well in his owne name as others.

Which hee ſaid was ſo great a fault, as a man had need take heed, he fall not into any ſuſpition thereof. <hi>Vida</hi> being vanquiſhed by his tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, changed his purpoſe of ſending Letters vnto the Pope. <hi>Vergerius</hi> being then willing to withdrawe himſelfe from the Councell,<note place="margin">The cauſe wherefore <hi>Vergerius</hi> was put from the Councel.</note> came towards <hi>Ceruin,</hi> and demaunded of him what the Articles were for which he was deiected from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell and company of other Biſhops. <hi>Ceruin</hi> anſwered, becauſe I vnderſtand thou denieſt that the Legends of S. <hi>George</hi> and of <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> are true. Is it true ſaid <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ergerius?</hi> I haue, and doo yet denie it: And my opinion is founded vpon Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third. For he hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded that both thoſe Legends ſhould be taken out of the Breuiarie: And in the Preface at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the booke, he ſaith that he hath commaunded that all ſuch ſhould be taken out, which were not true. <hi>Ceruin</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe ſurpriſed, could anſwere nothing; but that men ought not to hold ſuch for good men, as in any maner whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, ſeemed to agree with the Lutherans, and therefore wee withdrawe thee from our Councell.</p>
               <p>I thought it good to recite this, to the ende it might bee knowne, that there are alwaies ſome euill affected towards the true doctrine, ignorant of holy Letters, and ſtubborne to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and defend all ſuperſtitions.</p>
               <p>Yet as he was a man of ſingular modeſtie, and of a life

For after the death of <hi>Iulius</hi> the third, hauing bene choſen Pope, as alreadie before he was diſeaſed with the Iaundies, it increasſed ſo vpon him, that he died the 22. day after his election, the night before the firſt of May. A brute ranne that he was poiſoned, but it was not ſo. A feawe dayes before his death, he would needs be crowned, but with ſmall charge, very modeſtly. The Cardinall <hi>Farneſe</hi> with them of his part, had giuen him his voyce, although be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there had bene great enmities betwixt them: but hee did it becauſe he hoped there was none would be more diligent to bring that to an end, which <hi>Paul</hi> the third had determined to doo.

The
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:9561:287"/>
commotion was bridled and ſtayed by certaine Lords of the Towne. As for the ſeditious people, ſome amongſt them were executed, others ſaued themſelues by flight. But the cauſe wherefore they would haue driuen away the French amongſt others was, becauſe lately there were many of them receiued for Burgeſſes, by meanes whereof their faction was weakened, and the other part ſtrengthned, by the number of the new Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes which had bene added therevnto.</p>
               <p>The French at this time raced many Caſtles by the Count <hi>Montferrat,</hi> that they might haue victuals in greater aſſurance: For if the enemie had occupied them,<note place="margin">

He bought houſes in the Towne, and a Caſtle nigh the Towne called <hi>Binningen,</hi> with poſſeſſions of a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenew: It was eaſie for this man being very cautelous and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till, and hauing his eyes looking on all ſides, to gaine the hearts of many, and to procure outward reputation: who was greatly ſuſtained and augmented, by that he had great ſummes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and very pretious moueables daily brought him, from baſe <hi>Almaine</hi> and <hi>Flaunders.</hi> There hapned certaine prodigious ſignes before his death. One of his houſes (he had two in <hi>Baſill</hi>) was burned with fire of lightning: and the other which he had ſumptuouſly builded in the Medowes, was alſo conſumed by fire, and all his pretious moueables which were therin: &amp; ſoone after, the chamber floores of his houſe where he made his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, fell downe ſuddenly: yet they ſay, nothing hapned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him more intollerable to beare before his death then this, that one of authoritie in baſe <hi>Almaine,</hi> came to the Towne of <hi>Baſill,</hi> and <hi>Dauid George</hi> knew well, that by litle and litle hee ſhould be diſcouered.</p>
               <p>His Secretaries and diſciples were maruellouſly aſtoniſhed at his death, becauſe they were of opinion he ſhould neuer haue died: Although their hope was ſomething maintained, by that he had ſaid (as after was reported) he would againe take life, by the ſpace of three yeares, and bring to paſſe excellent things. Hee held in his houſe a ſtate almoſt royall. And for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of his houſe and Caſtle, it was well ruled, euery one had his eſtate and office in that family, and the labours were ſo diſtributed, that he had no need in any thing to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy others then his owne.</p>
               <p>In the gouernment of their common good, they very ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerued three things, to the end they might more and more conceale their ſo pernitious a Sect.</p>

Thirdly, that they ſhould not diſcouer any one article of their doctrine to any of <hi>Baſill,</hi> no not to any <hi>Switzer,</hi> neither ſhould they ſeeke to drawe any to their doctrine.</p>
               <p>The ſumme of his accurſed doctrine was: That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer had hitherto bene giuen of God by <hi>Moyſes,</hi> by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, by Ieſuſ Chirſt himſelfe, by his Apoſtles and Diſciples, is imperfect, and vnprofitable to make vs obtaine the true and perfect felicitie: and was onely giuen to this vſe, that hitherto their doctrine might repreſſe men, and keepe them vnder as young men and children, and ſo containe them in their offices. But the Religion of <hi>Dauid George</hi> is perfect, and hath in it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient efficacie and ſtrength, to make happie him that receiueth it, he being the true Chriſt and <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the we beloued of the Father, in whom the Father taketh great pleaſure: borne not of the fleſh, but of the holy ſpirit, &amp; of the ſpirit of Ieſus Chriſt: hauing hitherto beene kept in an vnknowne place, for all his Saints: to reſtore in ſpirit the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not by the Croſſe or tribulations, or death as the other Chriſt, but for the loue and grace of the holy ſpirit of Chriſt.</p>

For after he had perſecuted both the Miniſters and poore flocke of that Church, by many tyrannies and impudent writings; with ſeditious practiſes, he hindred as much as in him lay, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of the Lords glory: who after raiſed vp the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gales to take the Fortreſſe which he had builded in the Ile, by him called <hi>Collignyen <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alois:</hi> finding no reſiſtance within, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſaid <hi>Villegagnon</hi> being retired into <hi>France</hi> (taken with an apprehenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the ſauage people would eate him) had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained no ſuch company of people as were neceſſary for the defence of ſuch a place.</p>
               <p>And although in that number there were ſome valiant and wel experimented in Armes: yet for as much as they were accompanied with ſuch as had no knowledge therein, and were ill maintained, yea pined away with famine and diſeaſes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they would abide the enemies furie, they withdrew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with the ſauage people.

               <p>In this ſame yeare 1559. in the moneth of May, the Lord triumphed ouer Antichriſt, in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancy &amp; patience of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> executed to death for the witneſſe of his truth in the kingdome of <hi>Spaine,</hi> by the practiſes of the officers of the Inquiſition, wherof it ſhal not be impertinent briefly to touch.</p>
               <p>About an 100. yeares ago, that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabelle,</hi> kings of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> eſtabliſhed that Inquiſition againſt the Iewes, which after baptiſme kept their cerimonies.

But ordinarily they eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the richeſt, the learneſt, &amp; ſuch as of little began to become great: for they deſired bootie of ſome, they feared <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

They eſpied &amp; marked very nigh theſe 3. ſort of people, that if there came any word out of their mouthes it ſhuld be noted: &amp; thogh they ſpake no word, yet would the Inquiſitors

finde meanes enough againſt ſuch as worſhipped them not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently: for after they had ſhut them in priſon, they would keep them there a long time without ſpeaking vnto them, and at leiſure inuent Rymes againſt them: In the meane while no man durſt ſollicite nor ſpeake for the priſoners. If the Father ſhewed to haue any care of his childe, hee was ſtraight impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as a fauourer of hereſie. No perſon could haue acceſſe to any priſoner which was in any dungeon or other obſcure place: neither might hee write: but beſides the miſery and horror of the priſon, the priſoners endured a thouſand outrages and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, and after blowes with whips, and diuers other the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt iniuries that can be imagined. Sometimes they are ſuffered to eſcape by infamy, and from ſome high place they are ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto the people. During their impriſonment, their proceſſes and their Inditements goe not forward in courſe of lawe: (and for ordinarily a priſoner ſhall be ſo kept vp &amp; tormented, two, three, or foure yeares) and if there be any thing done therein, there are none but the Inquiſitors, their officers and executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that know any newes of them. After one hath tortured and beaten them the ſpace of many moneths, he that will haue his life, he muſt diuine and geſſe at his accuſor. If then the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed can diuine the name of his accuſors, and what is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, in firmely and ſtrongly denying that which is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and laid to his charge, and after great proteſtations, to be an hartie and a very affectioned ſeruant and ſubiect of the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, his life being ſo ſaued: yet he is not thereby ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but after hauing endured infinit pouerties &amp; miſerie (which they call their penance) they are let goe, but yet in ſuch ſort as they make him weare a kinde of coate of yealow colour, called <hi>Sambenito,</hi> which is a publike infamy vnto him and all his race. But if contrary the priſoner be an ill diuiner, after diuers tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures he is condemned and cruelly burnt.

Although the authoritie of this perſon ſerued to the increaſe of this dangerous errour, yet there wanted not for many learned men which oppoſed themſelues betimes againſt this errour, and prooued euen to <hi>Brencius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe (without that either he or any of his Diſciples could an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer pertinently therevnto) that if ſuch an opinion of the vbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of the fleſh of Ieſus Chriſt, and of the perſonall vnion of the two natures, according to the definition of <hi>Brencius,</hi> were true, the two natures of Ieſus Chriſt ſhould be ſeperated euen according to the eſſence, as well in Ieſus Chriſt, as in S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and other the faithfull: and Chriſt ſhould be God after the fleſh. Behold a blaſphemie which eſtabliſheth the hereſie of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> ſeperating the two natures of Chriſt, and which on the other ſide confoundeth the properties of thoſe two
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:9561:310"/>
natures, as did the heretike <hi>Eutiches.</hi> Notwithſtanding that they diſcouered to <hi>Brencius,</hi> the abſurdities and blaſphemies riſing vpon his opinion: yet left not he to maintaine it, hauing a Diſciple called <hi>Iames Andreas,</hi> who with certaine other that after roſe vp, added errors vnto errors. And which is worſe, <hi>Brencius</hi> in the end of his life, in the place to humble himſelfe before God, for ſo moleſting the Churches, in the making of his teſtament, thundred againſt the Churches which approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not his vbiquitie, being ſo farre audacious, euen he alone, who could not vnto the purpoſe reply to the arguments of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Doctors which liuely refuted him, as to condemne all the Churches of <hi>France, England, Scotland, Suetia,</hi> and others. This teſtament was maintained by his Diſciples, and from that time, till this inſtant, hath cauſed great euils, and kindled a fire which cannot be extinguiſhed, if God ſet not too his hand in ſome eſpeciall maner.</p>

that the Prince was conſtrained to cut off his way, to enter his troupes, and retier himſelfe into <hi>Holland,</hi> whether he was called by the eſtates of the Countrey, being accompanied with a ſmall number of people.

The Sunday following, the Admirall was moſt traitorouſly

ſlaine in his chamber, and caſt dead out of the windowes vpon the pauement: where he was knowne of <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi> After, they ruſhed vpon the other Lords, Gentlemen &amp; Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, which were ſlaine alſo: ſome within the Caſtle <hi>de Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine,</hi> others without. This was done betimes in the morning. All that day and morning was employed by ſuch as they call Catholicke Romanes, in ſleying men and women of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, many, not ſparing women bigge with childe, no nor litle children. They continued this the dayes following, but not in ſo great number, becauſe the murderers found not any more to ſley. The day of the wounding, and the Sunday, the King diſpatched Letters expreſly vnto the Gouernours of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, whereby he aduertiſed them, that that diſorder hapned beſides his knowledge, and to his great griefe, by the practiſes and enmities of the houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and that he determined to take good order therefore; in the meane time, hee would that his Edict of pacification ſhould in each point be maintained: Briefly, he imputed the Admiralls wounding and death (whom in the ſaid Letters he called his Couſin) to the particular qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of the houſes of <hi>Chastillon,</hi> and <hi>Guiſe.</hi> But meer contrary, on thurſday the 28. hee declared and cauſed to be publiſhed, that that maſſacre and horrible murder had beene done by his expreſſe commaundement, and to preuent a conſpiration of the Admirall and his partakers: wherof notwithſtanding nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he nor his Councellors made it appeare, nor could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any profit, although it was much prooued and deſired of many. Whileſt great and litle were thus hungring and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting after innocent bloud, the ſame Sunday the 24. of Auguſt, certain Prieſts by Art made a great Thorn-tree in the church-yard of S. <hi>Innocent,</hi> flouriſh at noone time of the day, and cryed, a myracle, a myracle. This encreated the rage of the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them of the Religion. And although the Prieſts in the meane while filled well their powches by ſuch an inuention, making the people beleeue that the Catholicke Romane Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion began now to flouriſh againe in <hi>Fraunce:</hi> yet their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe was ſoone after diſcouered, and the tree remained deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but euen then when it flouriſhed, ſome ſaid that God had

Moreouer certain weekes after <hi>le Sieurs de Briquemald</hi> &amp; <hi>de Caragues,</hi> excellent men, &amp; which had done great ſeruices to the Crowne, the one by Armes, and the other in affaires of iuſtice, were (in hatred of the Admirall and of Religion) hanged &amp; ſtrangled within <hi>Paris,</hi> in the preſence of the king himſelf, his mother &amp; his brethren.

The Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> publiſhed a diffamatorie arreſt and iudgement againſt the Admirall, whoſe bodie was taken from the gibet, and ſo ſecretly buried that his enemies could not finde it out.

captiues, and that this <hi>Baſſa</hi> beeing thereof explained to the Turke, he was therefore bountifully rewarded, and ſet in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter place and authoritie then he had before: but at the ſiege of the Caſtle <hi>Ziſekna,</hi> he was driuen to flie, and there receiued by death a iuſt reward for his trecherie.</p>

               <p>But in this Seſſion a great diſſention aroſe amongſt the Proteſtant Princes: the reaſon was, for that the Elector <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> did not ſo ſtrictly and preciſely keepe the confeſſion of <hi>Augusta,</hi> as the reſt of them did: that is to ſay, Duke <hi>William Fredericke,</hi> Adminiſtrator of the Electorſhip of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> who in the adminiſtration of the charge of the Electors in their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noritie, recalled and brought in the opinions of <hi>Flaccus Illiricus,</hi> and <hi>Iacobus Andreas</hi> (approoued of the aforeſaid Electors) and all thoſe that withſtood them, or oppoſed themſelues againſt either, in Vniuerſities, Schooles, or any place whatſoeuer, hee cruelly perſecuted and baniſhed them, as <hi>Caluinists</hi> and <hi>Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glians:</hi> ſo that at <hi>Lipſia</hi> and other places, vnder the pretext and colour of his execution againſt the <hi>Caluinists,</hi> much ſpoile and hurt was done. Many of theſe beeing let out of priſon, were receiued by the Elector <hi>Palatine:</hi> and for this cauſe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of <hi>Saxonie</hi> would ſeperate themſelues in this Seſſion, in the common petitions and propoſitions from them that held of the Count <hi>Palatine:</hi> but the greater part of them deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of peace, did not conſent thereto. But when it was obiected to the Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi> that hee was of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary religion to his father, hee before them all made an
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:9561:360"/>
orderly and modeſt confeſſion of his faith and religion, in this maner.</p>
               <p>I haue not anyway digreſſed from the religion which my worthy father profeſſed. He whileſt he liued, beleeued not in S. <hi>Martin</hi> or S. <hi>Iames,</hi> but in Chriſt. The ſame beliefe, the ſame grounds and principles of faith I do conſtantly hold, and euer intend to do. My father condemned the errours of <hi>Arrius, Nestorius, Eutychius,</hi> and the Anabaptiſts, and ſo do I his ſonne; not onely condemne them, but with my ſoule deteſt and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre them. The errours in the Sacraments (which are two fold; ſome of them who make Idolls of Sacraments, and worſhip and reuerence the ſignes for the thing ſigned, not obſeruing nor conſidering the ſignification of the Sacraments: other ſome that vnderſtand them for naked and ſimple ſignes) my father deteſted, and ſo do I his ſonne. I come nearer: My father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected <hi>Caluaniſme</hi> and <hi>Zuinglaniſme,</hi> and ſo do I his ſonne. If ſo be it be true, that the Vbiquitaries and Flactians do faine, that is to ſay, if truth, or omnipotencie, or the whole preſence of Chriſt ſhould bee denied vpon the earth. But in this errour I am happier then my father, in that I know the true and right religion vnder the name of <hi>Caluine,</hi> to bee defiled and ſcandal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, by certaine ſeditious and ambitious perſons in <hi>Germanie:</hi> which my father had knowne if he had liued longer, as now the two mightie Electors of <hi>Saxonie, Augustus</hi> his ſonne, and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> do vnderſtand.</p>
               <p>In this Seſſion great conſultation was had, for compoſition for peace in the lowe Countries.</p>
               <p>This yeare the Italians made great tumults in <hi>Brabant:</hi> the reaſon was, for that they were not ſo much eſteemed of ſince the Duke of <hi>Parmaes</hi> death, and that the Spaniards were preferred before them: that they had pay daily, and the Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans not regarded. For this cauſe they left the Kings Campe, and tooke the Towne of <hi>Sidien</hi> in <hi>Brabant,</hi> and fortified it. In this ſpace no pay was ſent, wherfore they made great hauocke throughout all <hi>Brabant,</hi> euen to the gates of <hi>Bruxelles.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints were made hereof to the Gouernour the Arch-duke of <hi>Erneſtus,</hi> that hee was faine to ſend certaine companies of
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:9561:360"/>
the Spaniards who had authoritie to bring them into order, and make them obedient, or driue them out of the Countrey. This more incenſed the Italians, but the Spaniards draue them out of certaine of their holds: And <hi>Graue Maurice</hi> fearing leaſt they of enemies, ſhould become friends, went to the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, and politikely praiſed them and their dauntleſſe ſpirits, extolled their worthy acts, and great victories that they got vnder their famous leader the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> that the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iard, had offered them ſuch an iniurie and diſgrace as the like was not to bee borne, and therefore it behoued them to looke to their ſafetie, and that there was no better way but to ſerue vnder the King of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> as long as they might bee well payed.</p>
               <p>The Italians mooued by his perſwaſion, the laſt of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember wrote to the King of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> humbly deſiring him, that he would receiue them into his charge and defence, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in number 1023. footemen, and 200. hoſemen.

               <p>The Arch-duke <hi>Ernestus</hi> died at <hi>Bruxells,</hi> as ſome ſay, of a melancholy, for that hee might not marrie the Infant of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and that the names of his houſe of <hi>Auſtriche</hi> againſt the Turkes, and his owne againſt the confederates, had no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſucceſſe, that he was not onely deſpiſed of the enemie, but of the Spaniards, and that hee had receiued no Letters a long time from the king, amongſt whoſe Councell hee had many enemies: hee died of the age of 42. a very modeſt and ſober Prince, who was ſeldome ſeene to laugh.</p>

For although that in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles time and their next ſucceſſors, there roſe vp certaine mutinous perſons to trouble the happie reſt of the Church, this hurt not much, the maieſtie of the ſpirit of God diſcouering it ſelfe in ſuch ſort in the preaching of the Goſpell, that all the world was conſtrained to acknowledge in this infirmitie of the ſeruants of God, an admirable efficacie, to biing all wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and humane power captiue vnder the obedience of Ieſus Chriſt. True it is, that alreadie Sathan thought vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his affaires, and brought forth his practiſes with greater force then euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, building his Sinagogue nigh vnto the Church. For euen when the Apoſtles themſelues liued, certaine Iewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles making the ſame profeſſion of Chriſtianiſme, fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Ieſus Chriſt in diuers maners, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> his Epiſtles doo witneſſe. And what diligence ſoeuer the ſeruants of God vſed to eradicate and root out the tares which the enemie did ſowe: yet remained there the ſeedes thereof in the boſome of the Church during the periodes following: God meaning to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his, and to ſhewe them that truly they had and would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies haue cauſe to fight in this life, but that the triumph ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was reſerued for the other world. For as for the ſtrength of the perſecutors ſince the Apoſtles time, it hath alwaies ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it true, that the bloud of the Martyrs is the ſeede of the Church.</p>
            <p>But let this be ſaid in a word, onely to awake the Reader and to prepare him to a diligent meditation of the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

hiſtorie. Now ſomething is to be ſaid of the ſecond periode of the firſt time. The Apoſtolike men,<note place="margin">Of the ſecond periode of the firſt time of the Church.</note> armed with the vertue and power of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord, maintained conſtantly the truth, amongſt all the tempeſts and ſtormes of perſecution, and in deſpite of Gentiliſme, &amp; of diuers hereſies which boldly began to left vp their heads. In ſo much, that great maruel it was, that ſo ſoone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo great light, men ſhould ſee the Eaſt in many places coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſo deep darknes, many goodly Churches ruinated, and the doctrine of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tranſported otherwhere. Yet the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt euil was in the bowels of the Church it ſelfe; many Paſtors wherof, not being ſo attentiue as of reaſon they ſhuld haue bin to conſerue and keepe the puritie of the Euangelicall doctrine, but ſuffering to take roote (I know not how) that which taſted of carnall wiſedome: in ſo much that in the place of the true end &amp; marke which the Goſpell propoſeth vnto vs, men began to eſtabliſh vnto vs, all the perfection of Chriſtianitie in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and afflictions for the Goſpell, and in arreſting &amp; abiding a litle too ſubtilly, vpon the ſtay of certaine fantaſtike perſons, ſpringing from the ſchoole of Philoſophers, ſo fell by litle and litle, to that vnhappineſſe, as to transforme the holy ſcripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to allegorike interpretations, a maruellous baite for the curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of humane vnderſtanding, and a fountaine of infinite miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes in the Church. True it is that the firſt inuentors of ſuch things, thought nothing leſſe then that which came after. So much then did the Lord humble his people. But about the end of this periode, euil was ſeene to aduance, and ceremonies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in ſuch ſort, that men enclined vnto Indaiſme and Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme, the loue of ſolitude and Munkery, the abſtinence from marriage, and from certaine viands and meates on particular dayes, many Feaſts and other ſeeds of ſuperſtition after ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, tooke a maruellous roote. So the commencement of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the dead, and of the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, did then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer themſelues: not that the intent of ſuch as made mention of the dead, to encourage the liuing conſtantly to ſerue God, and which brought of their goods into the company of the faithfull, for the comfort of the poore after the celebration of the Supper, was to bring in the execrable Idolatrie which long

time after ſprung vp. There were alſo introducted and brought into Baptiſme, certaine ceremonies, yet not ſuch as the ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſuperſtitions which ſince haue bin forged. Finally the good intent began to ſhewe it ſelfe, and from thenceforth to lift vp the head, vntill at the laſt vpon the ende of the ſecond time of the Church, it roſe vp aboue the word of God.</p>

               <note place="margin">Of the third periode of the firſt time of the Church.</note>As for the third periode of the firſt time, heerein it was happie, in that God during that time, raiſed vp diuers learned perſons, Greekes and Latines, to oppoſe themſelues with liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly voyce at Sinodes, as alſo by their bookes, whereof wee haue ſome number at this day, againſt the impietie of infinite here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes.</p>

            <p>Let vs now ſay ſomething of the ſecond time of the

Church, which we diuide into two periodes. The firſt,<note place="margin">The ſecond time of the Church fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The ſecond from <hi>Charlamaine</hi> vnto <hi>Charles</hi> the fift of that name, Emperour, about 700. yeares.</p>
            <p>In the firſt periode of this ſecond time of the Church, as the Antichriſt of the Eaſt thruſt himſelfe well forward, that of the Weſt eſtabliſhed his Throne, and then was the doore open to all errours: which notwithſtanding entred not at once, but came by litle and litle into the Church. Aboue all, the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of purgatorie, fire, and of the ſacrifice for the dead, were the foundation of the Papaltie and of all that vermine of their Cleargie and infinite Sects of Monkes, which like Graſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers from the deepe pit, came to ſpread themſelues through <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> But it was in the ſecond periode of the ſecond time,<note place="margin">The ſecond periode.</note> that Idolatrie and ſuperſtitions obtained the vpper hand. Inſomuch that the poore Church as it were buried, had no more any ſpring, neither appeared there any token wherevpon to caſt her eye, but onely the inuocation of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt in Baptiſme. And although from time to time, the Lord made ſhine ſome flames and torches in the bowells of that darkeneſſe, to redargue and weaken ſuch as rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſo heauie and palpable ignorance: yet was their blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſ ſo lamentable, and their ſleepe ſo deepe, that for one which lifted vp the head, and to whom Antichriſt gaue no releaſe nor leaue to approach, witneſſe all ſuch as during this periode oppoſed themſelues neuer ſo litle againſt his tyrannie, an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite remained liueleſſe and altogether dead. The Lord making himſelfe admirable in the mercie which he ſhewed vpon ſome, and renowned in horrible and iuſt puniſhment of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, which loued better lyes then truth. Who can heere recyte the ſuperſtitions &amp; Idolatries of Antichriſt, &amp; his crafts and ſubtilties, to eſtabliſh his kingdome and tirannie vpon bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and ſoule? He had his ſeruants and inſtruments of all ſorts, to leane, faſten, encreaſe, and multiply his Throne in the Temple of GOD, carrying in his browe the name of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, ſitting in the Temple of God, calling himſelfe God,
<pb facs="tcp:9561:368"/>
yet vnknown of ſuch as called themſelues Chriſtians, which he put off vntill the end of the world, and to I know not what fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and dreame of an Antichriſt which ſhould be borne but a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before the ſecond comming of the ſonne of God. Briefly, the great ſpiritual <hi>Babilon,</hi> the murdreſſe of ſoules, had her king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome during this period, tyrannizing the Iſraell of God, hid and diſpearced in a litle number and by her impoſtures, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies and impieties, mocked the true God, &amp; Father of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, whoſe name auowed with the mouth, ſhee trode vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her feet, by her abhominable errour.</p>
