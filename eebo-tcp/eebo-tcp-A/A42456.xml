         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The other doubt he moveth concerning the cause of my <hi>proclaiming so bitterly</hi> against him, and being <hi>so highly offended</hi> with him, is, <note n="c" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>Whether it be, because he calleth M.</hi> Wotton <hi>by the name of</hi> Anthony Wotton. And <hi>if that be the cause,</hi> he telleth me, that <note n="d" place="margin">Sic scil. beare solet ami<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Which to shew, let me entreat M. <hi>Walker</hi> to make M. <hi>Wottons</hi> case a while here his owne.

            <p>But that that followeth, is yet more ridiculous, that <hi>herein he did M. Wotton a singular favour.

               <hi>Among some other passages, you had this speech in effect, that you thought that my Lord of</hi> London <hi>would not willingly do any thing, that might impeach M</hi> Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, <hi>because (as you had heard) his brother of Cheswick was very gracious with my Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d. Thus much in effect, and not a jot more, did I signifie to M.</hi> Walker <hi>onely by way of demand, &amp;c. How soundly and charitably M.</hi> Walker <hi>collected hereupon, that you either said or intimated, that you durst not commit your selfe to the Bishop of</hi> London, <hi>because he is a wicked man, &amp;c. I leave it to others to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. This I professe, that neither when I received it from you, nor when I told it to his eare, I did so much as conceive or imagine, that you had any such conceit of my Lord of London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus that reverend Divine, now with the Lord: by whose testimony may appeare, how prone <hi>M. Walker</hi> is to tenter out mens words, beyond all, not charitable onely, but even reasonable, construction.</p>
            <p>From his <hi>Letter, M. Walker</hi> proceedeth to the <hi>Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:100644:13"/>
or <hi>Conference</hi> therein required; which he saith is <note n="n" place="margin">Vindic. p. 9.</note> 
               <hi>the subject of mine invective against him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In relating whereof yet I use no <hi>Invective</hi> at all. I report onely what was done and exhibited on both parts: &amp; what resolved by the parties on either side deputed to heare and decide. Neither of which <hi>M. Walker</hi> either doth or can deny.</p>
            <p>But <hi>M. Walker</hi> must give me leave, to deale here a little more freely with him; and to tell him in plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner tearmes, that many things delivered in this part of his <hi>Narration,</hi> are either utterly untrue, or such as may justly be suspected of untruth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He maketh his very entrance into it with a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest untruth, tho a matter of no great moment. He saith, that <note n="o" place="margin">Pag. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Upon the receit and reading of that his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, M.</hi> Wotton <hi>sent him a Letter of defiance, and therein professed his scorn and disdaine of his threatnings: but the next day he sent him another, wherein he promised to yeeld to his motion.</hi> Which, tho not much materiall, whether so or no, yet is not true. For <hi>M. Wotton</hi> sent him but one Letter with a Postscript of diverse date added thereunto: which must needs therefore come to <hi>M. Walkers</hi> hands both at once; and not the one this day, and the other the next, as <hi>M. Walker</hi> here relates it. <hi>M. Wotton</hi> had indeed begun and gone on a good way in a large <hi>Answer</hi> to M. <hi>Walkers</hi> whole <hi>Letter;</hi> which is yet to be seen; and I could well have been content to afford it room here, save that I found it unfinished, and withall was loath to make this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course overlong. But therein it seems he altered his mind, and sent him this shorter. Which, if but to shew the difference of these two mens spirits, I have thought good here to insert.</p>

But I must plainly professe, that I can hardly be perswaded of the truth of your protestation: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I finde your present Letters, being the first that ever I received from you, so full of bitternesse. Yet could I have been contented to have made some Answer to them, but that I see it would be to small or no purpose. For a great part of your vehement accusation concerns other men, and not me: who am not (in any equity) to be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with their faults, (if any have so faulted)</hi>

And to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose were it, for me to deny, and you to affirme; and so as it were out-vy one anothers credit? Concerning the offer you make of putting the points in question, whether first you doe justly charge me with heresie and blasphemy; and whether secondly, my writings do not shew me to be a Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian; I could happily have yeelded thereunto, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting against any one whom you name, if you had not so violently sought it, by frighting me (as you imagined) with complaining, to my L. of</hi> Canterbury <hi>his Grace and the Commission, of me, if I refused. Good M</hi> Walker <hi>do not think me so childish or foolish, that I can be scared with such terrours and menacings. I am so throughly resolved of the truth I hold, differing</hi> immane quantum <hi>from</hi> Socinus <hi>blasphemy, and so well perswaded of my Lords soundnesse in judgement, and the equall hearing I shall have in that Court, that I am not afraid to put the matter

there to triall. Wherefore use your discretion, either in this, or in any other course, that shall best please you: I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be ready to maintaine the truth I know, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that, I yet know not, whensoever it shall be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to me by the Word of God.

               <note n="q" place="margin">See Relat. p. 56.</note> whom he importuned for an open and judiciary tryall; and being pressed by him rather to condescend to the course by M. <hi>Walker</hi> propounded, had thereupon consented and yeelded thereunto; upon condition that the <hi>Bishop</hi> would assigne one of his <hi>Chaplens</hi> to be a party in the hearing; who to satisfie <hi>M.

               <hi>the said Doctor upon the first reading of M.</hi> Wottons <hi>speeches so paralleld, condemned M.</hi> Wotton <hi>for an hereticke, and his errors for blasphemy.</hi> To wit, at a private table, as before he had related.

            <p n="1">1. That his <hi>Parallel</hi> was not delivered in before or without M. <hi>Wottons</hi> Answer. For so <note n="n" place="margin">See Relat. p. 10.</note> it was agreed.

               <hi>VVhy they did not then without more adoe justifie M. VValker, and censure M. VVotton. M.

M.

            </p>
            <p>Such a passage, as I know not, nor any man else, I thinke, what to make of.</p>
            <p>For first, who be the <hi>They,</hi> that he speaketh of? was it the Doctor alone, that told all this faire tale, and pretended all this? how cometh he then to say, <hi>They?</hi> Or if <hi>M.

               <hi>by silence</hi> only <hi>assented</hi> to, what the Doctor then said? Again, where, think we, meaneth he, that all this was <hi>pretended?</hi> was it pretended at the Table? or was it related only there; but pretended before at the meeting among our selves? But I shall leave it to any man of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary understanding to conceive, how likely it is; either that M. <hi>Wottons</hi> friends (for such <hi>M. Walker</hi> saith they were all) should thus conspire to ensnare him; or that such a consultation should be had among us in the presence of M. <hi>Wotton</hi> himselfe. For we did nothing at our meetings but in the presence of M. <hi>Wotton</hi> and <hi>M. VValker;</hi> who were neither of them ever excluded, or required to withdraw themselves upon any occasion, during the whole hearing. But <hi>M. Walker</hi> it may well seem, was somewhat di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted in mind, when he writ this; studying how to bring in handsomely what himselfe had invented,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100644:18"/>
and uncertaine whom to father and fasten it upon. For marke, I pray you, what immediately follows.</p>
            <p n="12">12. <note n="a" place="margin">Pag. 20.</note> 
               <hi>This course,</hi> saith he, <hi>being</hi> M. <hi>Gatakers device, I refused to yeeld unto: because I had never opposed M.</hi> Wotton, <hi>but onely in his opinions formerly published, and and not in future Expositions: and because I had fully proved my charge, I desired their verdict and just judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But after much importunity I yeelded; and so lost my cause, and was drawn into a new businesse; that was, to contend with M.</hi> Wotton, <hi>not about his former opinions, but about new expositions, which he would make in answer to my Parallel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which words are couched many grosse fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods: nor was the former passage so intricate, but this is much more untrue.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He affirmed before, that <hi>They pretended</hi> this and that; and thereupon plotted to get I know not what under M. <hi>Wottons</hi> hand. Now he telleth his Reader, that <hi>This course was M. Gattakers device.</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Quo teneam vultus mutan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem Protea nodo?</note> Where at length shall we have him?</p>
            <p n="2">2. True it is indeed, I was the first mover, that <hi>M. Walker</hi> might be requested to make such a paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel; as <note n="c" place="margin">Relat. p. 9.</note> in my relation I acknowledge. But that I ever had any such pretence, as M. <hi>Walker</hi> here talketh of, or ever made any motion for ought under <hi>M. Wottons</hi> hand, is most untrue. <hi>M. VVotton</hi> onely him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self moved, (as I <note n="d" place="margin">Relat. p. 9, 10.</note> elswhere relate) that he might have the Parallels sent him from M. <hi>Walker</hi> a day or two before the next hearing, that he might subjoyn his answer and defence thereunto.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That <hi>M. Walker refused to yeeld thereunto, and was by meere importunity drawn to admit it,</hi> is likewise most false. For it was presently deemed most equall on all
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100644:18"/>
sides: nor did <hi>M. Walker</hi> in the least manner make any shew of dislike.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is a like true, that upon the giving in of his parallel, <hi>he required our verdict;</hi> that course being not as yet condescended unto, which he tearmeth <hi>my device.</hi> When as the course mentioned, and by <hi>M. VVotton</hi> himselfe motioned, was agreed upon before his parallel was composed, and much more then, before it was exhibited. So that by <hi>M. Walkers</hi> relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a verdict should have been past by his Judges, while the parallel, containing the evidence, was as yet, if as yet at least, in the Actors brain only.</p>
            <p>But to take the businesse, and discusse it a while, as <hi>M. Walker</hi> here relateth it.</p>
            <p>First, I referre it to any indifferent mans judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to determine, whether it were agreeable to equity, for <hi>M Walker</hi> to require <hi>a verdict of his Iudges,</hi> (as he termeth them) or for them to give it in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, against <hi>M. Wotton,</hi> upon a bare sight of some positions found as well in <hi>M. Wotton,</hi> as in <hi>Socinus,</hi> (supposing it so to be) before M. <hi>Wottons</hi> defence were either exhibited or heard. And here let me crave leave to shew the unreasonablenesse of such a request, and it be but by one instance. <hi>M Walker</hi> in his Parallel chargeth this Position upon <hi>M. Wotton,</hi> as a point of <hi>Socinianism, an hereticall and blasphemous assertion,</hi> that <note n="e" place="margin">Prallel. Er<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Faith is a condition appointed by God to be performed on our parts for obtaining of justification.</hi> Now, it being granted, that the very same words were by <hi>M. Walker</hi> exhibited, (which yet precisely they are not) as well out of <hi>Socinus</hi> his works, as out of <hi>M. VVottons</hi> writings: had it not been, thinke we, a very discreet part of them whom the businesse was

committed unto, to have <hi>without more adoe,</hi> so censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, as <hi>M Walker</hi> had charged it, and in so censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, to have condemned themselves, (who openly to <hi>M. Walkers</hi> face <note n="*" place="margin">Relat. p. 36.</note> professed, that they had oft taught it) and not themselves alone, but all orthodox Divines (for ought I know) in the whole world; yea the Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe to boote too, if some of them may be beleeved; for Socinians and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous heretiks? For I would fain know of <hi>M Walker,</hi> how this differeth that he so chargeth, from what <hi>Pareus</hi> saith, and avoweth to be S. <hi>Pauls,</hi> that <note n="f" place="margin">Fidem inserit, ut d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Faith is the condition, under which Christ is given us for a propitiation.</hi> Or, not to looke out abroad, but to keep our selves at home; I should desire to understand from him, what he thinketh of these passages in some writers of our own; and those men of no mean note neither.</p>
            <p>First, that of M. <hi>Fox,</hi>

               <hi>The Evangelicall promise requireth no other condition to the attaining of salvation, besides Faith one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereby we beleeve on the Sonne of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, that of <hi>M. Perkins,</hi> in his Reformed Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique; <note n="h" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Or if these men be not of that esteem with <hi>M. Walker,</hi> but that he can be content to let them go for damned heretiks, to beare <hi>M. VVotton</hi> company in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100644:19"/>
the same condemnation, I should crave to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, what he deemeth of M. <hi>Pemble,</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="margin">M. <hi>Wil. Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and faithfull servant of Christ, excelling in grace and vertue, abounding in all wisdome, and in all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, lively sense and utterance of heavenly and supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall mysteries, far above all that could be expected from, or is ordinarily found in one of his age and yeers.</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>Nor doubteth therefore, nor is afraid to say of him, that he is ascended up into that supercelestiall glory, towards which he had ever bent all his studies and desires.</hi> This <hi>M.

               <hi>There are two covenants that God hath made with man: by one of which salvation is to be obtained. The one is the Covenant of works, thè tenor whereof is, Doe this, and thou shalt live. The other is the Covenant of Grace, the tenor whereof it, Beleeve in the Lord Iesus, and thou shalt be saved. The condition of this Covenant,</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 22.</note> 
               <hi>(required in them that shall be justified) is faith. The performance whereof differs from the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the condition of that other Covenant. Doe this and live, is a compact of pure justice; wherein wages is given by debt; so that he that doth the work obeying the Law, may in strict justice for the work sake claim the wages, eternall life, upon just desert. Beleeve this and live, is a compact of freest and purest mercy; wherein the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of eternall life is given us in favour for that, which beares not the least proportion of worth with it: so that he that performs the condition, cannot yet demand the wages, as due unto him in severity of justice, but onely by the grace of a free promise, the fulfilling of which he may
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100644:20"/>
humbly sue for.</hi> And againe, <note n="o" place="margin">Ibid. p. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Altho the act of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a sinner be properly the onely work of God, for the onely merit of Christ: yet is it rightly ascribed unto faith, and it alone; for as much as faith is that main condition of the New Covenant; which, as we must performe, if we will be justified; so by the performance whereof we are said to obtaine justification and life.</hi> Thus M. <hi>Pemble:</hi> in which passages (tho I will not justifie all therein contained) he fully and cleerely expresseth <hi>M. Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> meaning not as his owne judgment only, but <note n="p" place="margin">The Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches thus explaine themselves. Ibid. p. 23.</note> as <hi>the doctrine of the Reformed Churches by them so explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> Now I demand of <hi>M. Walker,</hi> whether for this damnable and detestable position, we shall doe well, without further search or triall, (the rather since that the same, he saith, is found in <hi>Socinus)</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne <hi>M. Pemble</hi> of heresie, and require, if not his bones to be digged up againe and committed to the fire, yet his books at least containing such blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous stuffe, to be burnt. Which if he shall deem fit, sure <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, unlesse <hi>Pareus</hi> be much mistaken, must goe the same way. Or if he shall be of another mind concerning these blessed men, whether it be not extreame partiality, to let that goe for sound doctrine in M. <hi>Fox, Perkins, Pareus</hi> and <hi>Pemble,</hi> that in <hi>M. Wottons</hi> writings without further adoe, upon <hi>M. Walkers</hi> bare relating of it, must be condemned for blasphemous heresie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I desire to have it considered, whether it were equall to censure a man for an <hi>heretike,</hi> upon bare positions or sayings extracted out of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, without any regard had to, or notice taken of, his own <hi>Expositions</hi> of them; or his <hi>Reasons</hi> alledged to prove his dissent in them from the <hi>errors</hi> of those

whom he is charged to concurre with; confirmed by collation of place with place in his writings, and by consideration of the maine scope and drift of the dispute, course and tenor of the discourse, and the different sense and meaning of the words and terms used by either. For example, <hi>M. Walker</hi> in his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel alledgeth a saying of <hi>Servetus,</hi> (and that is all that he hath out of him throughout his whole Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel) that <note n="q" place="margin">Parall.

               <hi>For one act of Faith was Abraham righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> And presuming that <hi>M.

And here I shall crave of M. <hi>Walker</hi> and my Reader to tell a story or two: it is the humour of old men (such as <hi>M. Walker</hi> and my selfe) to be now and then telling of tales. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that, while I aboad at <hi>Lincolns-Inne,</hi> the night before <hi>Legate</hi> the Arian appeared in the Bishops Consistory at <hi>Pauls,</hi> (of whose being in trouble I then knew nothing) there came to my chamber there, at a very unseasonable houre, a Gentleman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like man; who having knockt at the doore, ask'd to speake with me; and entrance afforded him, reacht me a little scrole, wherein were these words written, <hi>Whether was the Godhead of Christ begotten of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of the Father from all eternity?</hi> and withall desired me to give mine opinion, whether that were not an error? I required to know first what the meaning of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100644:21"/>
the party was, that held or affirmed it. He answered me, <hi>According to that in the Creed,</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Creed of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Nicene Creed.</note> 
               <hi>God of God, light of light.</hi> I told him, that these were not the words there used: and that <hi>to speake properly, the Godhead was not said, either to beget, or to be begotten. If the parties mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning were, that Christ being God was begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who is likewise God from all eternity; the sense were sound, but the speech improper. Then belike, as it is there written,</hi> quoth he, <hi>it is an error. As the words sound,</hi> replied I, <hi>it is: yet it may be not, in his sense that spake it.</hi> He requested me to give him that under my hand. I craved his name. He told me, I must excuse him for that. I told him, he should likewise excuse me for this. And so we parted. But the next day, hearing <hi>Legate</hi> in the <hi>Consistory,</hi> as I past thorow <hi>Pauls,</hi> I began to surmise, that this party might be some friend of his; and that some Divine or other, in conference with him having let some such speech slip from him, this party his friend might beate about to get under some other Divines hands the censure of it as an error. Whence I then gathered, that a man had need to be wary, how he condemne a man of error, of heresie much more, upon a bare relation of words, before he understand what his meaning is. Againe, I remember, that a busie Separatist being committed to Newgate, and there arrogantly challenging to dispute with all commers, and scornfully playing upon and gibing at such as dealt with him; <hi>M Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw</hi> (whom we shall find <hi>M. Walker</hi> anon grinning at) was by some friends brought to him; who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the mans spirit, and having had some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with him, the issue whereof he caused to be set down in writing under both their hands, that he
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100644:22"/>
might not talke of this and that, after they were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; <hi>M. Bradshaw</hi> a little to represse his insolency, told him, that for all his prating so much of the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Church, (the common subject of such mens disputes) yet his skill peradventure might be but mean in the maine principles of religion. And being by him provoked to make triall, if he pleased; he demanded of him, whether <hi>Christs Deity assumed the Person of man or no.</hi> To which question the bold bayard without stop or stay returning an affirmative answer, that <hi>it did, M. Bradshaw</hi> told him, <hi>it was grosse heresie.</hi> And so left him. And indeed, if the words alone be regarded, so it is; even the heresie of <hi>Nestorius,</hi>

               <hi>I should desire you to tell me ingenuously, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not too probable, that your portentous doctrine of Transubstantiation, joynd with your forementioned perswasion of,</hi> No papists, no Christians, <hi>hath brought a great many others as well as himselfe to Averroes his resolution, Quandoquidem Christiani adorant, quod co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medunt, sit anima mea cum Philosophis.</hi> You see the Authours own words exactly retained, precisely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported; and yet that resolution thence gathered, and therein fathered and fastned upon the Author, then which he nothing lesse there either uttered or intended.

Nor, I suppose, could we justly have escaped that censure; should we, as <hi>M. Walker</hi> here would have us, upon his bare reading of <hi>M. Wottons</hi> words to us, without all further examination of them, or hearing of him, have proceeded to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him of <hi>heresie and blasphemy;</hi> that is, no lesse, as I take it, then high Treason against the highest Majesty.</p>
            <p>But thus much may suffice, if not more then suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, to evince the iniquity and inequality of <hi>M.

Which yet he was not so unreasonable then as to motion or mention; much lesse to presse upon us, being then somewhat more reasonably minded, then (it seemes) he now is: and which, had he pressed upon us, as now he saith that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100644:25"/>
he did, had been most unequall and unjust for us to have granted.</p>
            <p n="13">13. As far from truth as the former, are those things that in <hi>M. Walkers</hi> narration next follow: to wit, that <note n="a" place="margin">Vindicat. p. 20, 21.</note> 
               <hi>at an other day M.

               <hi>he desiring to argue with M.

Wotton had of his Parallels.</hi> All which is most untrue. For neither did <hi>M. VVotton</hi> ever refuse to answer <hi>M. Walker,</hi> offering any orderly dispute: (which how well <hi>M. Walker</hi> is acquainted with, those that have had dealings with him in this kind, or have read his writings, may soon see) nor did <hi>their Iudges</hi> (as he calleth them, but very partiall and unjust ones, it seems, all of them; and it is well, that herein we suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all alike from him) refuse to heare him alledging ought, whereby he might make his charge good. Nor was he by them ever denied a Copy of <hi>M.

Yet what he addeth here, I confesse, is in part true; that when he saw he could not have his owne will, nor deterre us from acknowledging under our hands, that we found neither heresie, nor blasphemy, in ought, that he had evinced <hi>M.

reporteth) <hi>to bring him and us before higher Judges;</hi> (he came not as yet to so high tearms with us; and is herein therefore not unlike some debauched per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who to encrease their owne shame, will <note n="d" place="margin">Fingunt, que vera negarent, Dum credi, quod non contigit esse, volunt.</note> vaunt many times of more evill then ever they did) but not without intimation, that we did more then we could answer in taking upon us to determin heresie; (or to tell, belike, what we thought to be, or not to be such) having forgotten, it seems, his own motion at first, and what himselfe had requested us to meet about: just as if a party appeaching his neighbour of wrong doing, and having pressed him to referre the matter betweene them to Arbitrators joyntly agreed on; should, when he perceived them enclining to acquit his neighbour of the pretended wrong, demand of them, whether they would take upon them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide right and wrong: and yet why might not we do as much as <hi>Walker</hi> himselfe had done? for how did not he take upon him to determine what was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, when he charged <hi>M. Wotton</hi> with it? Nor again, is it untrue, that afterward he endeavoured to have us called in question for our meeting, tho by himself procured. Insomuch that the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> in regard of his importunate exclaiming against us, did at first pretend to doubt of, yea in a manner deny his giving way to it; untill being minded of the <note n="e" place="margin">Relat. p. 6.</note> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made for one of his Chaplens to be a party in the businesse, and his condescending thereunto, he could not but agnize it.</p>
            <p>But that which followeth; and, if M. <hi>Walker</hi> in his Narration observe any due order, should be done after his departure, and so in his absence; to wit; that <note n="f" place="margin">V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>M. Wotton should promise to make &amp; publish a large
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100644:26"/>
Declaration, wherein he would free himselfe from all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian errors; and in the mean space begged this favour, that they would subscribe to his expositions, that they found no heresie or blasphemy in them; and that upon this promise and entreaty they did subscribe, as followeth, &amp;c.</hi> To which is a little after added, that <note n="g" place="margin">Pag. 24.</note> 
               <hi>M. Wotton begged this beggerly subscription;</hi> (which sticketh shrewdly in his stomacke; as well it may) and that <hi>M. Gataker pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curedit.</hi> All this, I say, hath little or no truth in it. Neither did <hi>M. Wotton</hi> make any such promise. Nor did he beg our censure to be given under our hands, as a favour; but required it, as a thing just and equall. Nor was it by me procured; unlesse giving my vote among the rest for the grant of it, may be so constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Nor was it upon any such promise condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto, as is here pretended. And <hi>M. Walker</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly had very long eares, if being absent at the doing of it, he could heare what was then and there said: or a quicker eare then the rest of the company, if being present, he heard that, that some, I am sure, and the rest, I verily beleeve, never heard, and yet might have heard as well as he, had it been spoken.</p>
            <p>Howbeit I must here request the reader to take notice of one point of cunning conveyance, in the relation of the forme subscribed, whether commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Doctor, from whom he saith he had it, (tho he might have seen it, and had it from us, if he had pleased to stay our subscribing) or by <hi>M Walker</hi> himselfe, I know not; and I would be loath to charge him further then I have good ground: He telleth his Reader, that <note n="h" place="margin">Pag. 21.</note> M. <hi>Wotton begged of us to subscribe to his Expositions,</hi> and the <hi>subscription</hi> it selfe he thus layeth down <note n="i" place="margin">Ibid.</note>

               <hi>their great love to M. Wotton;</hi> I will presume, they did all beare a Christian affection, as well to <hi>M. Wotton</hi> as to <hi>M.

M. Wotton</hi> and <hi>M. Randal</hi> were likewise divided. And little reason therefore there is to presume, that these men out of great love to <hi>M.

            <p n="16">16. But this is the salve for those, whom <hi>M. Walker</hi> would excuse. As for the rest, it is not to be mervel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, if they were partiall in the busines. For <note n="a" place="margin">Pag. 24.</note> 
               <hi>M. Balm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford was</hi> M. <hi>Wottons silenced brother.</hi> (a fit squib to fall from the pen of him, that <note n="b" place="margin">Pag. 1.</note> erewhile complained so of his owne persecution) <note n="c" place="margin">Pag. 24.</note> 
               <hi>M Hicks was one of M.

               <hi>M. Gataker did more angerly and peevishly speake against him, and snarl at him, then his Adversary M. Wotton himselfe. So that he was forced to challenge him as well as M.

            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:100644:28"/>
It is true indeed, that M <hi>Wotton</hi> (whom <hi>M. Walker</hi> is yet content in part to acquit, so be he may thereby the deeper wound me, whom his spite, it seems, is more eagerly bent at for the present) demeaned himselfe very moderately, throughout the whole hearing; with great patience enduring much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful and despiteful language, whereof M. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> was no whit sparing. And, I suppose, it was fit, that those whom that office was committed unto, should endeavour to represse such clamorous bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and barkings, as neither beseemed him that used them; nor did any way further, but hinder ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the issue of that for which we met. In which kind, not I alone, but the rest also, laboured with <hi>M. Walker</hi> what they could; tho to smal purpose. But that I <hi>snarled at him</hi> otherwise, is altogether untrue.</p>
            <p>It is likewise true, that <hi>M. Walker challenged me</hi> once <hi>to dispute.</hi> (for, as for dispute with <hi>M. Wotton,</hi> so he would keep to the point, it was never denied him) upon this occasion. Some speech coming in the way, in discussion of the first pretended <hi>error,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>the imputation of Christs Righteousnes consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in obedience to the Law;</hi> and <hi>justification consisting wholly in Remission of sinnes;</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>M. Walker</hi> in his heat told me, that it was reported (for he buildeth much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reports) that <hi>I was wholly</hi> therein <hi>of Piscators mind:</hi> and <hi>if I would maintain Piscators opinion, he would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it out with me.</hi> Whereunto I then answered, that <hi>whether it were so, or no, was nothing to him; nor was it time for him and me then to dispute; being met for an other end.</hi> And this is also all the <hi>scornful disdain</hi> then used, or made shew of. As for the report, I shall make bold now to tell <hi>M. Walker,</hi> if he heard so, that he

            <p>But <note n="p" place="margin">Pag. 22, 23.</note> 
               <hi>by a pretty stratagem</hi> (for so he slileth it) <hi>he brought M. Stock before other witnesses to condemn M. Wottons opinions for heresie and blasphemy.

            <p>And thus much for the point, concerning which by M <hi>Walkers</hi> own relation, M. <hi>Stock</hi> upon the very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it, should in direct contradiction to his own subscription, passe such a censure. As for the <note n="l" place="margin">Vindic. p. 23.</note> speech he frameth in the words following, for M. <hi>Stock</hi> to excuse himselfe by: and his inference thence, <note n="m" place="margin">Ibid. p. 23, 24</note> 
               <hi>how dangerous a thing it is, even for godly men to be Judges in a controversie between a familiar friend, as M. Wotton was to these men, and a stranger, as himself was to the most of them.</hi> As the latter intimateth <hi>M. Stock,</hi> &amp; <hi>M. Wotton</hi> to have been at that time familiar friends, and so D. <hi>Baylie</hi> and the rest; and on the other side M. <hi>Stock</hi> (for of him principally here the speech is) with the most of the rest, and <hi>M. Walker</hi> to have been meere strangers either to other: which is the one of them as true as the other: so it adds little credit to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse pretended to be made then by him; which may well be questioned, considering M. <hi>Walkers</hi> minting and dilating faculty <note n="n" place="margin">See M. <hi>Eger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> Letter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore produced: and his peicing up of M. <hi>Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> assertions.</note> before shewed, whether much, if not all, of it, came not out of his own forge.</p>
            <p>And this shall suffice for the suggestions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning some of M. <hi>Walkers</hi> partiall and unjust Judges as he deems them, to prove that they subscribed in favour of M. <hi>VVotton</hi> against their own consciences and judgements elsewhere, either in publike or in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100644:33"/>
private, delivered directly to the contrary of that they then signed unto. Which I might well have leaft to be answered by those whom they concerne; save that some of them are now deceased: for me they touch not at all, nor my <hi>Relation,</hi> who report on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what they subscribed to; and that firmed with the <hi>Attestation</hi> of such of them as survive.</p>
            <p n="18">18. But for that, which concerns them all, and my selfe among the rest, to prove, that <note n="o" place="margin">Vindic. p. 21.</note> 
               <hi>they durst not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly justifie their Subscription;</hi> (which makes me the rather now to beleeve what I have formerly been informed, that M. <hi>Walker</hi> oft in his Table-talk should not stick to give out, that <hi>we were all of us ashamed of what we then did.)</hi> he saith that <note n="p" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>the Expositions</hi> (for so we will now call them, since that M. <hi>VValker</hi> will have them so stiled) <hi>thus subscribed, were committed to D. Eaylie, with charge that he should keep them close, and not suffer M. VValker or any other man to see or read them, untill M. VVotton had made a larger Exposition, and fully purged himselfe from Socinianism.</hi> A strict charge, you see, as <hi>M. VValker</hi> delivers it, of men wondrous cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and as may seem, no lesse timorous of displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing M. <hi>VValker;</hi> for what else the matter should be, I, for my part, am not able to conceive. And I mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veil why he doth not adde, that we conjured one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, to tell no body what we had done. For that was as needfull to prevent our feares, as the keeping of our subscription from sight; and he might as well have said or written the one as the other. For this also in truth is as farre from truth, as M. <hi>VValker</hi> is from faire dealing in the whole carriage of this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. And here I would crave leave to demand of M. <hi>VValker,</hi> whether he were present at the very act of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100644:33"/>
our subscribing or no. If he were present, he might easily heare, what that was, and in what manner it was conceived, that was agreed upon to be subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed unto; yea he might have seen our subscriptions to it. For it was not done in any concealed way, but in the view of all then present. And to what end then should such a charge be given to the Doctor, that <hi>M. VValker</hi> should by no means be admitted to the sight of it? If he were absent, (as it is likely enough that he was, wanting patience to endure any longer stay, after he perceived once what was resolved upon) I would faine know of him, how or from whence he knowes, that it was with such caution committed to the Doctors custody.</p>
            <p>True it is, that it was indeed in some sort <hi>commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his custody;</hi> or rather detained by him, having once gotten it into his hands, in favour of M. <hi>VValker,</hi> for ought else could be discerned. The delivery of it or a Copy of it to <hi>M. VVotton,</hi> according to his just request, being not at present resolved on, because it grew late; but put off to another day. On which meeting again, (but now without <hi>M. VValker,</hi> who came no more at us) after long expectation the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor at length presented himselfe to us; but could not be induced to deliver, either the subscription, or any Copy of it to M. <hi>VVotton;</hi> upon pretence that he held it not safe so to do; for that having been lately at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> at the High Commission, some (I know not who) had cast out some words there to him concerning our <hi>meeting,</hi> and that we might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure be questioned for it, as a <hi>Conventicle;</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially if our <hi>subscription</hi> should come abroad un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our own hands, and use made of it as an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100644:34"/>
against us. That therefore for the present he durst not part with it: But yet withall promising, that after some time, the noise of the busines being once over-blown, it should be delivered to <hi>M. Wotton,</hi> whensoever it should be demanded of him by two of the parties, one of either side, nominated in his behalfe. And this I do the more confidently avow, being holpen therein for some particulars, by a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall leaft in writing under <hi>M. Balmfords</hi> hand and mine own, and made while the businesse was yet fresh in memory; which I find in the same paper, in which the Attestation formerly published is extant, being afterward (but how long after, I know not) underwritten.</p>

               </gap> 
               <hi>M. Walker</hi> in his relations of it agrees not all out with himselfe. For whereas here he telleth us, that <hi>M. Richardson</hi> should in a more rigid manner <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But be <hi>M.

               <hi>M.

from Christ, and all interest in Christ, who so shall affirme, had need looke to himselfe, lest he bring thereby a greater guilt upon his own soule, then <hi>M.

But let this goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the bundle of untruths, which <hi>M Walker</hi> hath sluft this his <hi>Pamphlet</hi> with; that <hi>M Gataker counselled</hi> one, whom he had never seen to his knowledge, nor changed two words with, <hi>to write a rayling libel against M. Walker.</hi> whereas any reasonable man would rather imagine, that M <hi>Godwin</hi> wrote that, whatsoever it be that he wrote, provoked by <hi>M Walkers</hi> own wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting against him and railing upon him; which, it seems, therein he returneth answer unto, and is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and published by him together with it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the truth, yea, or likelyhood of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, I am very well content, that credit be given to his other <hi>relations;</hi> those at least that <note n="g" place="margin">Pag 8.</note> he builds upon the credit of other mensreports; if not to more then a few, that must rely upon his own.</p>
            <p>With M. <hi>Godwins Libell</hi> he joyneth <note n="h" place="margin">Pag. 24.</note> M. <hi>Gatakers Invective.</hi> for so he is pleased to stile my <hi>relation,</hi> as <note n="i" place="margin">Pag. 9.</note> before, so here again. which being abroad, <hi>I</hi> leave to others to judge, whether it deserve that <hi>Title,</hi> or no; or, if <hi>M.

            </p>
            <p>But there is another <hi>Invective,</hi> that he challengeth me for. and it shall not be amisse, by way of antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, hereto take it in, and consider of it, as being a branch of the same generall <hi>Enditement,</hi> that in this

Walker) who had opposed some errors and contradictions, which are in that booke, in his Funerall Sermon preached at M. Bradshaws buriall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein <hi>M. Walker</hi> sheweth himselfe no change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but still like himselfe. Nor am I sory, that <hi>M. Walker</hi> hath thus mentioned <hi>M. Bradshaw,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by given me occasion to speake somewhat of the man, and somewhat also of his worke: that I may thereby further vindicare him a little from <hi>M. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> obloquies; as I have already in part, from the slanderous calumnies of an other foul mouthed railer, a leader of <hi>Separatists</hi> at <hi>Amsterdam my Rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> to whom in defence of <hi>M.

And I did what I then did, with as much griefe and regret of heart and mind, as ever I performed any office in that kind. The losse of so worthy, and so intimate a friend, (besides the common losse of one so qualified and endowed, to Gods Church) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly piercing with me more deeply, then every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one

VValker</hi> or any other, I shal leave to the equall and indifferent consideration of others, when I shall have precisely related what then I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and subjoyned the occasion, whereupon I spake it.</p>
            <p>In a short speech, that I had, before I entred upon my <hi>Text,</hi> concerning the <hi>occasion</hi> of mine appearance at that time in that place; and of the party decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, to whose remains that office of Christian sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was then to be performed; having spoken some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, but very briefly, and over-scantly rather than otherwise, concerning <hi>his singular dexterity, as in resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cases of conscience, so in clearing of controversed points in Divinity;</hi> (in either of which kinds he did so excell, that I have seldome, if ever, known his match) I added these words concerning the latter; <hi>Wherein his labours, tho uncharitably taxed and traduced by some, yet have been, as myselfe can testifie, not onely reverently esteemed by divers of good note in both the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversities, professing some of them in my hearing to have profited much by them, and to have been thereby better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in some particulars, which they conceived not so well before; but even by some strangers of eminent place and profession beyond the Seas, very highly extolled, as by some of their Letters to him is yet to be seen.</hi> And this, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> protest, is all that I then said; which M. <hi>VValker</hi> here, (a man it seems, of a very tender eare, tho of too tart a tongue) terms <hi>inveighing against him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, if it may not be over-troublesome, I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest my Readers patience a while, to receive from me some not overlong relation, concerning the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion

of that short clause, consisting but of foure words at most, that <hi>M. Walker</hi> taketh so much offence at; that he may thereby be the better enabled to judge aright whether I spake any more, then <hi>M. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> had given over-just occasion to speake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. Bradshaw</hi> had published, a succinct indeed, but very accurate, (if sundry men of good parts may be beleeved) <hi>Treatise</hi> concerning the <hi>Justification of a sinner before God.</hi> In the <hi>Preface</hi> whereunto, having given intimation of some difference among our Divines in some particulars concerning this head of Divinity; <hi>Whence,</hi> saith he, <hi>many weake minds have been somewhat perplexed; and some strong ones (at least in their own conceits) exceedingly distempered, as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> there were amongst us, which overturned foundations, teaching blasphemous heresies about this matter; whereas all of us with one mouth professe this, That a sinner is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified not by any formall inherent Righteousnesse in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but onely by the free and meere grace and mercy of God, through the meritorious satisfaction of our Saviour Christ, the onely mediator between God and a sinner. Wherein we all give all the glory of our justification and salvation to God in Christ Iesus, and therein hold the main Foundation. We differ onely in certain circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; wherein nothing is derogated, either from the mercy of God, or merits of Christ, or arrogated to our owne workes.</hi>

            <p>Now the former part of this speech M <hi>VValker</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to himself (as, tho not named, yet conscious to himselfe of his own guilt, he well might) inveighed fiercely and furiously (after his wonted guise) in a <hi>Serm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And withall, by a <hi>Stationer,</hi> whose shop I frequented, he sent me a challenge, that <hi>such a book be understood to be mine,</hi> (as true as that <note n="n" place="margin">Pag. 26.</note> I set <hi>M. Godwin</hi> on worke <hi>to write a railing libell against him) tho it came out in another mans name,</hi> (not unlike that of the <hi>Amsterdam railer,</hi> that <note n="o" place="margin">

That, if he had ought with me, he knew where mine aboad was; if I ought with him, I knew (I thought) where he dwelt, but that I had no desire to have dealings with one of that spirit, of which I perceived him to be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Herewith not content, he wrote a booke against M. <hi>Bradshaw</hi> so vile and so virulent, that tendring it for allowance at <hi>London-house,</hi> he could not obtaine passage for it to the presse. Howbeit <hi>a Copy</hi> of it came to <hi>M.

            <p>The <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>M. Walkers</hi> work was this:

            </p>
            <p>And that he may end in no better manner then he began, he thus enters upon the last Chapter:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Chapter, tho it treat onely of things humane, such as we daily heare and see, and have experience of, yet it hath divers errors: As if the Author had vowed to erre in all things; and to infect Heaven and Earth, and all things sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and profane, with his Treatise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now whether such a <hi>censure</hi> as this might not wel beare out as much, if not much more, then I then spake, I am well content, that any man, not wholy forestalled with extream prejudice, be judge.</p>

                     <hi>There hath been sent me from</hi> London <hi>by M.</hi> Cappel <hi>Pastor of the French Church there, a little book of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, small in bulke, but in learning, wit and acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse very great, written in English by</hi> William Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw. <hi>This because it much pleased me, and</hi> Gomarus <hi>and I had but one copy between us; I translated out of hand for mine own use into French, and left the English copy to</hi> Gomarus. <hi>I will speake ingenuously. I never hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto read ought in any humane writing of dogmaticall Divinity, that so exceedingly liked me.

                     <hi>Right worthy sir, I wrote before to you, that I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived your truely golden little book of justification, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged by you, and turned into Latine; and that presently, but hostily, I read it over, so eager an appetite had I to it, by reading the other Edition of it in English before. Since that I have read it over againe, not once but often, and taking leisure thereunto. Which the oftner I reade over againe, the more it pleaseth me, and is approved of by me: so accurately and exactly is it composed by you. I hope this birth and issue of your mind will find approbation with peaceable and moderate dispositions, on whether side so ever they are; albeit you condescend not to them in all things that they require. You pace so in the middest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween either opinion, that you ought not to displease either of them, if they truly love peace and concord.</hi>

            <p>I might adde, that if <hi>M.

               <hi>without feare or regard</hi> (to use his own words of himselfe) he lets flie both at living, and at dead; and concerning that worke of his, by other pious, learned and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious so praised and apprised; which shall (I doubt not) survive with its due and deserved approbation from such; when <hi>M.

            <p>But 2. I say onely, that howsoever for the <hi>use</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of it; he be pleased to censure it; I hope, there wil not want others, whose judgements may wel weigh a little more at least with me, that wil ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of it as useful; and make a better and more charitable construction of it, (if not thank me for it) then he doth. And 3. it may be, if some quoted the Authors they alleadge, and pointed to the places they relate to in them, their evil usage of those they deale with, would the more easily be discovered. Howsoever, I shal choose rather to have my <hi>Margent</hi> so <hi>bedaubed,</hi> then my <hi>Text</hi> so <hi>stuft</hi> as <hi>M. Walkers</hi> is, as wel in this as in some other his writings.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I demand, what either this or the former is to the matter in hand, or the cariage of the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse between <hi>M. Walker</hi> and <hi>M.

of the badnesse of the cause he here deales in, he is loath to keep close to it, and willing rather to run out into any other thing, tho it have no relation at all thereunto.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, notwithstanding <hi>M. Walkers laborious</hi> employments, he wil yet, it seems, filch a little time from them, to examine <hi>M. Gataker</hi> upon a few inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatories; <note n="a" place="margin">Pag. 27.</note> 
               <hi>which unles he can answer with credit, he must of necessity for ever hereafter hold his peace, and blush as of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>But here <hi>M. Walker</hi> much mistakes his marke, and shoots at randome. For my <hi>Relation,</hi> which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to refute, is not <hi>M. Gatakers Defence</hi> of <hi>M. Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> but <hi>M. Wottons Defence</hi> of himself: nor did either I, or any of those that were joyned with me in the <hi>meeting</hi> related, undertake to defend <hi>M. Wotton</hi> as one free from all error, but delivered onely, what we thought of <hi>M. Wottons</hi> own <hi>Defence</hi> of himself in regard of ought that <hi>M. Walker</hi> had laid to his charge. Nor doe I therefore conceive, either that I stand upon me <hi>credit</hi> engaged to answer to all <hi>M: Walkers Interrogatories;</hi> or that <hi>M. VValker</hi> hath any du power thus to bind me over to <hi>silence</hi> and <hi>shame,</hi> upon my refusal so to do.</p>
            <p>Yet let us see what they are.</p>
            <p>The first is, <note n="b" place="margin">Pag. 27.</note> 
               <hi>Whether it be truth and honesty to say, that</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Relat. p. 36.</note> 
               <hi>all the eight Ministers with unanimous consent generally resolved and pronounced, that there appeared not to them either heresie or blasphemy in ought that M. Wotton was by M. Walker convinced to have delivered or maintained: when their subscription shews that they medled onely with his Expositions, and not with his here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100644:47"/>
and blasphomous speeches, in which he paralleld him with Socinus the heretike,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To all which I shall easily answer in a word, that if that which he here relateth as mine, be the same in effect with what is <note n="d" place="margin">Relat. p. 38.</note> testified under the hands of <hi>D. Gouge and M. Downham</hi> (as it is evident that it is) the untruth and dishonesty must be charged upon them: who, I hope, wil be better able to acquit themselves in this busines of either; then he that so shamelesly chargeth them therewith.</p>
            <p>As for that, which he addeth, to disprove it, of <hi>Expositions;</hi> (which word how it came into the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,</hi> I suppose, no man surviving, unles himself, now knows;) and of <hi>speeches heretical and blasphemous,</hi> (words of course with <hi>M. Walker) wherein he paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leld M. Wotton and Socinus;</hi> enough before hath been spoken to satisfie any reasonable Reader; tho not, it may be, <hi>M. Walker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second <hi>question</hi> is, <note n="d" place="margin">Pag. 27.</note> 
               <hi>Whether I think, that M. Wotton renouncing the Law of God and the righteousnes thereof performed by Christ in our steed for our justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; doth not in so doing deny Christs ransome paid, and satisfaction made to Gods just law, for our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and for remission of our sinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I answer as briefly, as to the former; that it appeared not to the eight Ministers by ought <hi>M. Walker</hi> produced, that <hi>M. Wotton</hi> held ought in this particular, that did necessarily infer, what <hi>M. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> thence concludeth.</p>
            <p>And let M. <hi>VValker</hi> give me leave here, if I may be so bold to minister a crosse interrogatorie to him; to wit, whether <hi>Pareus, Piscator, Ursine, Olevian,</hi> and the rest of them, who deny <hi>Christs righteousnes in ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100644:47"/>
the Law morall to have been performed by him in our steed, for our justification,</hi> do therefore deny <hi>all ransome paid and satisfaction made to Gods just Law for our redemption and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>emission of our sins,</hi> or no. and whether they be therefore <hi>all</hi> of them <hi>blasphemous hereticks.</hi> But more especially, what he thinks of that speech of <hi>Pareus</hi> above mentioned, that <note n="e" place="margin">De Act. &amp; Pasio. Chr. Obed. possit. 5. p. 181.</note> 
               <hi>those that ascribe the merit of our righteousnes thereunto,</hi> (that which directly crosseth what <hi>M. Walker</hi> here avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) <hi>do doubtlesly make Christs sufferings of no use or effect.</hi> Surely, if <hi>M. Wotton</hi> speak no more then <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus,</hi> (and he hardly speaks so much) <hi>Pareus</hi> must as wel, if not much rather then <hi>M. Wotton,</hi> passe with <hi>M. Walker</hi> for an heretike. And if those that hold as <hi>M.

            </p>
            <p>For example, the first of them is, <note n="n" place="margin">Pag. 28.</note> that <hi>Faith is obedience to Christs commandements; who commandeth us to beleeve and repent.</hi> And it is true, that <hi>Socinus,</hi> as <note n="o" place="margin">Relat. Poscr. p. 48.</note> elsewhere I cite him, <note n="p" place="margin">De Christ. Servat l. 4. c. 11.</note> maintaines as <hi>M. Walker</hi> here saith that he doth. But what saith <hi>Lubbertus</hi> to him for it? a man whom M. <hi>Walker</hi> would seem much to admire, and told us at our meeting, that he was by I know not whom stiled <hi>Orthodoxorum ocellus.</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Quod dicit, Fidem esse ea sacere, quae Christus praecepit, falsum est. Lubb. ad l. 4. c. 11 p. 561. col. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Whereas he</hi> (to wit <hi>Socinus) saith</hi> (saith <hi>Lubbertus)
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100644:49"/>
that Faith is to do those things that Christ hath enjoyned, it is false:</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Dicere, fidem esse ea facere, quae Christus praecepit, est idem quod, iasanire. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>to affirme it to be so, is to be stark mad.</hi> So by <hi>Lubbertus</hi> his censure, not <hi>Socinus</hi> onely, but <hi>M. Walker</hi> also should be no better. Again, <note n="s" place="margin">Docet, Christo ejusque verbis credere idem esse quod Christo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedire: negamus. Obedientia enim est effectum sidei. errat igitur, qui contendit fidem &amp; obedientiam idem esse. Ibid. p. 582. col. 2.</note> 
               <hi>He teacheth, that to beleeve Christ and his words, is to obey him. We deny it. For obedience is an effect of faith. he erreth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that holds Faith and Obedience to be all one.</hi> And yet again, <note n="t" place="margin">Firmum est, quod Beza sori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, Fidem non posse mandato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum obedientiam significare. Ib. p. 574. col. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Firm stands that, which Beza writes, that Faith cannot signifie Obedience to the Commandements.</hi> Thus <hi>Lubbertus,</hi> one of <hi>M Walkers</hi> own <hi>Oracles.</hi> And indeed what did <hi>Socinus</hi> hereby intend, but to cut off all relying by <hi>Faith</hi> on Christ, as having paid a price to God for our sinnes, or satisfied for them by his death? yet this is M. <hi>Walker</hi> pleased to blanch over; as if he conceived his meaning to be nothing else, but that <hi>in beleeving and repenting, we obey Christs commandement, who</hi> 
               <note n="u" place="margin">Mark. 1. 15.</note> 
               <hi>commandeth us to repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</hi> And so is content to let it passe for currant, as <hi>a true and orthodox tenet</hi> in <hi>Socinus,</hi> because M. <hi>Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> dissented therein from <hi>Socinus;</hi> though condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Lubbertus</hi> (yea by whom not?) for a grosse error, and in his intendement very dangerous.</p>
            <p>The second point, wherein <hi>M. Walker</hi> affirmes <hi>M. Wotton</hi> to depart from <hi>Socinus,</hi> and which he affirmes to be <hi>true and orthodox,</hi> is <note n="q" place="margin">Pag. 28.</note> that <hi>Repentance, which comes not but by Faith, is the means to obtain for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenes of sinnes, which Christ hath brought.</hi> But he deales here with <hi>Socinus,</hi> to help him out, as he is wont to do with M. <hi>Wotton,</hi> to procure prejudice to him. For he takes part out of one passage, and part out of an other, (as M. <hi>Wotton</hi> hath <note n="b" place="margin">Answer to Error. 2. § 4. Relat. p 34. &amp; to Error 4 p. 28.</note> cited him, not expressing how far forth in every particular he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs with him, or dissents from him; but onely shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100644:49"/>
how in general he speaks not that, that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self doth) and so pieces up a <hi>proposition,</hi> which he would have deemed sound; withall paring of, what might serve to discover <hi>Socinus</hi> his grosse error, wherein <hi>M. Wotton</hi> intended to imply his departure from him. For, <note n="c" place="margin">Manifestum est, in salute per Christum partâ, Deum nihil aliud à nobis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisivisse quam paenitentiam &amp; vitae correctio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</note> 
               <hi>It is manifest,</hi> saith he, <hi>that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth nothing of us in the obtaining of salvation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by Christ, but repentance and amendment of life.</hi> And, <note n="d" place="margin">Poenitentiae addita alicubi est fides, non quia praeter ipsam poenitentiam fides in Christu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, tanquam aliquid amplius, quod huc pertineat in nobis efficiens, ad peccatorum remissionem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequendam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiratur, sed quia non nisi per fidem in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum ista poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia contingit. Socin. l. 3. c. 2. p. 321. col. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Whereas Faith is sometime added to repentance; it is not because Faith in Christ is required to the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of remission of sins,</hi> (directly contrary to what the Apostle <note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 3. 25.</note> professeth) <hi>as working somewhat more in us besides Repentance it selfe, that doth hereunto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain; but because Repentance comes not but by Faith in Christ.</hi> Thus he clips <hi>Socinus</hi> in favour to him; as he doth <hi>M. Wotton</hi> els-where to a contrary end. And yet further, because <hi>Lubbertus, Socinus his Antagonist,</hi> in refuting him, beates every where upon this, that <note n="f" place="margin">Peccatorum veniam conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio naturae ordine sequitur, non praecedit.

               <hi>Conversion &amp; Repentance do not in order of nature go before, but follow remission of sin, and justification; and <note n="g" place="margin">Resipiscentia justificationis effectum est.

Ib. ad l. 2. c. 12. p. 213. c. 2.</note> that <hi>our Repentance is the cause of the remission of our sins;</hi>

Ib. l. 3. c. 2. p. 338. c. 2.</note> 
               <hi>God indeed promiseth pardon to the repentant; but we deny repentance to be the cause for which God doth pardon.</hi> Here <hi>M. Walker</hi> strikes in to help <hi>Socinus</hi> at a dead lift, and telleth us, contrary to his Text, sure without any warrant at all from it, <note n="m" place="margin">Pag. 28.</note> that <hi>by obtaining forgivenes of sins, Socinus means getting the sense and assurance of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> a glosse wel-beseeming him, that professeth such a detestation of the very least sent or shadow of <hi>Socinianism</hi> in others.</p>
            <p>The third point is, <note n="n" place="margin">Ibid.</note> that <hi>faith is a beleeving of that which Christ taught, and an assurance of obtaining that he promised upon our repentance and obedience.</hi> Which whether it be a just <hi>definition</hi> of <hi>justifying Faith;</hi> (for of that here the question is) or do fitly expresse the office of it in the worke of <hi>justification,</hi> I leave to be discussed by others.

            <p>The sixt question is, <note n="a" place="margin">Pag. 28, 29.</note> 
               <hi>Whether M. Wotton affirming, that, If we be freely pardoned, then our sins were not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished in Christ our head and surety, doth not deny Christs satisfaction for sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I answer. he must shew first, where <hi>M. Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> so saith. For these words out of <hi>M. Wotton</hi> he never yet produced. Read <note n="b" place="margin">Relat. p. 19.</note>

            <p>His seventh question is, <note n="d" place="margin">Pag. 29.</note> 
               <hi>Whether M. VVotton be not guilty of heretical tergiversation and grosse contradiction in some passages.</hi>

            <p>The man, you see, can not speak of <hi>M. VVotton,</hi> but he must needs spit Fier and Brimstone. Every thing is either <hi>heretical</hi> or <hi>blasphemous</hi> in him. But am I, or is any man else bound to reconcile whatsoever <hi>contradictions</hi> are, if any be, or may be found in <hi>M. VVottons</hi> writings?

               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:100644:52"/>
may as wel be beleeved, as <note n="e" place="margin">In his Woolf in Sheeps clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</note> where he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the like of <hi>M.

            <p>For the first, which <note n="f" place="margin">Pag. 29:</note> he citeth out of my <hi>Defence,</hi> as he tearms it, though out of his own <hi>Parallel,</hi> and <hi>M.

            <p>Whereunto, tho sufficient to take away the see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming contradiction, I ad yet further what I touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon out of <note n="k" place="margin">Preface to Treat. of justif.</note> 
               <hi>M.

            </p>
            <p>For first, I might demand of him, where I so <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled M. Bradshaws book?</hi> What I spake of it in a short <hi>Speech</hi> before my <hi>Sermon</hi> at that time, I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly word for word related. But in <hi>M. Walkers</hi> hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolical language, every mole-hil is a mountain; every rivelet or drilling ril, a flood or a faire river; every but scanty or sleight commemoration or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, an extolling; every light touch, an <hi>Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive;</hi> every <hi>error,</hi> at least an <hi>heresie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, whether every one that commends a book in such manner as I there did, must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity approve it as wholly free from all error. I was by a <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Sir</hi> Maurice Bartlet.</note> worthy <hi>Knight</hi> sometime demanded mine opinion in a point concerning the seat of <hi>conscience,</hi> wherein <hi>two Divines</hi> of special note, run two divers and cros waies, <note n="h" place="margin">
                  <hi>M.</hi> Rob. Harris <hi>in S.</hi> Pauls ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise.</note> the one denying it a place in any natural <hi>Facultie</hi> of the <hi>soul,</hi> usually assigned; the other affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it a room in each of them: and professing my self to dissent from either, it was objected to me, <note place="margin">M <hi>Sam Ward,</hi> in Balm from Gilead.</note> that I had by an <hi>Epistle</hi> prefixed commended the worke of the one, wherein that opinion of his was found. to which I then answered that Gentleman, and so shal now <hi>M. VValker,</hi> that a book may war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably for the main substance of it be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended as useful, yea as excellent; albeit the party so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending it suppose the Author of it to have been
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100644:54"/>
mistaken in some things therein contained. So did M. <hi>Cappel</hi> with the same <hi>M. Bradshaws</hi> book; albeit in some things therein he dissented then from him, when so highly yet he indeed did <hi>extoll</hi> it, as you formerly have heard: and my selfe did somewhat the like sometime with <hi>M.

            <p>Thirdly, what if <hi>M. Wotton</hi> and <hi>M. Bradshaw</hi> do not herein at all differ, or crosse either other? but may very well be reconciled? may not <hi>M. Gataker</hi> then at least <hi>with a good conscience commend M.

Bradshaw</hi> is here said to affirm? And that it is so indeed, and in <hi>M. Bradshaws</hi> own judgement was so, may be easily made to appeare. For doth not <hi>M. Bradshaw</hi> in his <hi>Preface</hi> plainly shew, that the word of <hi>Imputation</hi> is overstrictly taken by some Divines, in which sense <hi>M. Wotton</hi> seems to him to have denied it; whereas the word might wel be understood in another, and a larger sense, profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing himself so to use it? So that the bare word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by the one, and admitted by the other, doth not necessarily imply any contradiction between them. no more then S. <hi>Pauls</hi> words, that <note n="l" place="margin">Rom. 3. 28.</note>

            </p>
            <p>And here I shall again crave leave of my Reader, to insert a short passage out of some writings enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed between these two Christian brethren;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100644:55"/>
both, I hope, now with God, and agreeing in all things; though in some particulars they dissented, while they lived here.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Wotton</hi> in his <hi>Animadversions,</hi> which I have by me, on <hi>M. Bradshaws book,</hi> thus excepts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The third opinion denying all imputation of Christs righteousnes is said to be somewhat erroneous. Yet the same opinion held onely in that strict sense of imputation, which the Autor himselfe rejecteth, and that upon good ground, as he acknowledgeth, is therefore cleered from all erroneousnes. For how can that be erroneous, that is held on good ground?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which <hi>M. Bradshaw</hi> thus answereth:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tho upon good ground, as to me seems, you deny impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in that sense only; yet your denial of all imputation may notwithstanding that be erroneous; being grounded upon a supposal of that which I think is erroneous, that there is no other kind of imputation but that, which is answerable to that strict sense aforesaid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which words it appeares, that the difference herein between them was rather in words, then in points: and that <hi>M. Wottons error,</hi> as <hi>M Bradshaw</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended it, was only concerning the use of a word, not concerning any point of faith.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, suppose the difference were not ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball, but reall, not in words onely, but in sense and meaning too; yet would it not therefore necessarily follow, that <hi>M. Wotton denieth the very form, essence, and being of justification,</hi> because he denies that, which <hi>M. Bradshaw</hi> affirms to be the <hi>Formall cause</hi> of it; or that M. <hi>Gataker</hi> must therefore of necessity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce <hi>M. Wotton</hi> an heretick; unles first it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that that is indeed and truth the <hi>formal cause,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100644:55"/>
of justification,</hi> which M. <hi>Bradshaw</hi> hath assigned: (which being found onely in a short <hi>Summary</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to his <hi>Treatise,</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">Woolf. chap. 2. Error. 8. on chap. 2. n. 11. The form is the pleading of the said righteousnes or innocency, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>M. Walker</hi> himself deems to contradict what is averred in the book; nor is it at all in the Latine edition,) and that M. <hi>Gataker</hi> also is therein of the same mind with M. <hi>Bradshaw,</hi> which for ought <hi>M. Walker</hi> knowes, he may not be.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, I should desire to know of <hi>M. Walker,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hold not <hi>the imputation of Christs active obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> to be <hi>the formall cause of our justification:</hi> and if he so do; which, I suppose, he wil not deny; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>he can with a good conscience pronounce Pareus free from heresie;</hi> notwithstanding that <note n="o" place="margin">De activ. &amp; pass<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chr. Obed. p. 181.</note> he denies the <hi>imputation</hi> of it <hi>unto justification,</hi> as <hi>derogatory from the al-sufficiency of Christs suffrings and his sacrifice;</hi> and consequently (by M. <hi>Walkers</hi> inference) takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the very <hi>form, essence and being of justification.</hi> if he cannot, how comes it to pas, that he reckons him here so oft among his <hi>Orthodox Writers,</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn <hi>M. Wottons</hi> opinions as heretical and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous? if he can, I see not, why M. <hi>Gataker</hi> may not do the like by <hi>M. Wotton,</hi> forought here objected. the argument being as strong (if not stronger) against the one as against the other.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, suppose it were an error, and a dangerous one to, that <hi>M. Wotton</hi> maintains; whence knows <hi>M. Walker?</hi> or how is he able to prove, that he holds it <note n="n" place="margin">Pag. 30.</note> 
               <hi>wilfully,</hi> that is, against his own knowledge, (for that seems to be intimated) and <hi>perversly,</hi> that is, as I conceive him, obstinately? to make him <note n="*" place="margin">

               </note> extraordinary gift in <hi>discerning of spirits.</hi> and if he will pretend, that he discernes it by his deeds;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100644:56"/>
which is hard to do in a point of meer Theorie; let him take heed, what manner of spirit by his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in this busines, being matter of practise, he gives men ground, to suspect or conclude himself to be led by.</p>
            <p>Lastly, suppose M. <hi>Walker</hi> to be so sharpsighted, and that he can pierce and peere so narrowly into <hi>M. Wottons</hi> conscience, as to discern that he doth <hi>wilfully and perversely</hi> maintain what he holds: yet unlesse that M. <hi>Gataker</hi> be as quicksighted herein as M <hi>VValker,</hi> and that he be able to descry in M. <hi>Wotton</hi> that <hi>wilfulnes and perversnes</hi> that <hi>M. Walker</hi> doth, he may still with a good Conscience justifie M. <hi>Wotton,</hi> and pronounce him (for <hi>proclamations</hi> he makes none) <hi>free from heresie;</hi> as wel as the rest of his reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend brethren have done, notwithstanding all <hi>M. Walkers</hi> evidence given in against him. since that <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 14. 13. 1 Cor. 4. 5. &amp; 13. 5. 7.</note> no man is bound to pronounce or deem of his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian brother, on the wors part especially, further then himself can see.</p>
            <p>His ninth <hi>question</hi> (to cut it somewhat shorter, that the readers stomack may be the les troubled in taking it) is this, <note n="p" place="margin">Pag. 30.</note> 
               <hi>How the faithful united to Christ, as their head, and made thereby partakers of his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and whole obedience to Gods Law, and thereby consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted righteous before God, can without hereticall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity be denied to be formally righteous by that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I answer: that first he presumes some things here that are to be proved; and are (as he wel knows,) by <hi>Divines</hi> not a few of the best note not acknowledged; as, that <hi>Christs Righteousnes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in his active obedience is part of that whereby the faithfull are made righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:100644:56"/>
Besides, that many things have the faithful inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in by vertue of their <hi>union and communion with Christ;</hi> which yet are not imputed unto them for the justifying of them, or for the making of them to stand righteous in Gods sight. The Wife by vertue of her union and conjunction with her Husband, hath a right to, and interest in, all that he hath, yea and in himself to. Yet is it not necessary, that whatsoever she hath joint interest in with him, should therefore go to the payment of her debts formerly contracted: especially, if suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent be found in any part of it. And that <hi>without he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall-pravity</hi> therefore, that which M. <hi>VVotton</hi> is here charged with, may be held; especially, unles we wil question <hi>the sufficiency of Christs death</hi> for the discharge of our sins; <hi>Pareus</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Ex de Act. &amp; Pass. Chr. Obed. p. 181.</note> his words (if he be at least of any credite with <hi>M. Walker)</hi> above-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned wil intimate; yea the whole discourse, whence they are taken, wil evidently shew.</p>
            <p>For his tenth and last <hi>question,</hi> the <hi>contradiction</hi> is the very same concerning <hi>Imputation,</hi> that was <note n="r" place="margin">Pag. 29.</note> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly propounded, the first in the seventh <hi>question.</hi> For <hi>M.

               <hi>Whether</hi> M. <hi>Wotton be not possessed with the spirit of Socinian blindnes and giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, when he derides Orthodox Divines, for making every beleever justified by imputation of Christs satisfactory obedience, a Redeemer, Saviour and Satisfier for all the Elect and Faithful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What by <hi>Socinian blindnes and giddines M. Walker</hi> meanes, I wean not. We use to ask, <hi>who are blinder
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100644:57"/>
then they that wil not see?</hi> and in this kind <hi>M. Walker</hi> hath bewrayed too much <hi>blindnes</hi> in this book. As for <hi>giddines,</hi> I know not, who are more likely to be possessed of it, then such as run round, like an Hors in a Mil.</p>
            <p>But how, or where, doth <hi>M. VVotton thus deride our Orthodox Divines?</hi> This crime thus fastned upon <hi>M. Wotton, M. Walker</hi> thus makes good. <note n="u" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>For in one of his written papers thus he argues: If Christs Righteousnes and Satisfaction be imputed to every beleever, then must every beleever be accounted a Redeemer, Justifier, and Satisfier for all the Elect. But this is absurd. Ergò, the Antecedent is fals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where first, I might demand of <hi>M. Walker,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man must of necessity be deemed to <hi>deride</hi> him, whom he disputes with, if he shal affirm some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to follow from that he holdeth, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces to be <hi>absurd,</hi>

            <p>First, suppose that <hi>a denial of Christs deity</hi> might be necessarily deduced from some <hi>Positions</hi> by <hi>M. Wotton</hi> maintained. would it thence follow that <hi>M. VVotton</hi> denies the <hi>Deity of Christ?</hi> It is no good consequence. For some thing may follow truly and necessarily from what a man holds; and yet he not

Thus from <hi>M. Richardsons</hi> grounds, by <hi>M. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> help, there is an incomparablo benefit befaln the whole world, for by this means great part of it, though they never heard of <hi>Christ,</hi> are sodenly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Christians.</hi> For they hold the main <hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> as certainly, nay more certainly then M. <hi>Wotton</hi> denies <hi>Christs Deity.</hi> Since that the one follows, you see, necessarily (unles <hi>M. Richardson</hi> be much mistaken) from what they hold; whereas the other by <hi>M. Walkers</hi> good leave, hath not as yet been shewed to follow so from ought by <hi>M. Wotton</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. and yet, I doubt much, that if trial be taken, we shal scarce find them sound in the <hi>Christian faith</hi> for all this.</p>
            <p>In the next place therfore, let us see, what it is, that <hi>M. Walker,</hi> here tels us, that <hi>M. VVotton</hi> maintained, whereby he hath brought upon himself so heavy a guilt as <hi>the denial of the eternal deity of the Son of God. He held,</hi> saith he, <hi>that Christs obedience did serve onely to justifie himself, and to bring him into high favour with God: so that God justifies us by him as by a favourite, onely upon condition of our trusting in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where <hi>M. VVotton</hi> saith all this, <hi>M. Walker</hi> tels us
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:100644:63"/>
not: and he that twits <hi>M.

For that <hi>Christs obedience serves to justifie himself,</hi> I suppose, no man can deny. since that <note n="s" place="margin">John 3. 21. &amp; 8. 46. 38. &amp; 18. 23.</note> our Saviour himself doth thereby usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally justifie himself against the false aspersions of his slanderous adversaries.

So the part (or office) of Faith is no other, then by beleeving in Christ and receiving of him, to perform that which God requires of us to the reconciling, that is, the justifying and adopting of us; that we may be partakers of the Redemption and life eternal procured for us by Christ.</hi> And towards the end: <hi>Although I grant, that the justification of a sinner, that is, the Remission of his sins, is to be fetcht properly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christs Obedience in the suffering of death: yet by his Righteousnes also in fulfilling the Law, I suppose that we obtain fauour with God.</hi> Which words of <hi>M Wotton,</hi> how they sute and agree, with what <hi>M. Walker</hi> would here fasten upon him, I leave to be deemed by any one, that hath not his eyes, either blood-shot, or gall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot, as it is to be feared <hi>M. Walkers</hi> were, when he either read that, or wrote this.</p>
            <p>Yea but, how doth <hi>M. Walker,</hi> from what he either finds in <hi>M.

               <hi>Now where,</hi> saith he, <hi>is the infinite valew of Christs Deity, if he have need of justification and favour for himself?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And is not such a <hi>question</hi> as this, think ye, enough
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100644:64"/>
to stop any mans mouth, or to open it rather, and enforce him to condemn <hi>M. Wotton</hi> without more ado for an <hi>Arian?</hi> But let us put <hi>M. Walkers Argument</hi> into form and figure, that we may the better descry and see the force of it. Thus then it must be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whosoever saith; that Christ hath need of justification and favour for himself, denies his eternal Deity, for he denies the infinite valew of his Deity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> M. <hi>Wotton holds, that Christ had need of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and favour for himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore he denies Christs eternal Deity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Proposition</hi> of this <hi>Syllogism</hi> may very well be questioned. For doth not the Word of God say ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, that <note n="i" place="margin">Math. 11. 19. Luke 7. 29, 35. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tim. 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Christ</hi> was, and is <hi>justified?</hi> doth not the same word say, that <note n="k" place="margin">Math. 3. 17.</note> 
               <hi>he was in favour,</hi> yea that <note n="l" place="margin">Luke 2. 52.</note> 
               <hi>he grew in favour, both with God and man?</hi> or was not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these for himself?</p>
            <p>Yea but, peradventure he had <hi>no need</hi> of either for himself.</p>
            <p>Surely those things, without which <hi>Christ as man,</hi> could not be, either accepted with God, or entirely happy; those it cannot be denyed but that be <hi>had need</hi> of, and need of <hi>for himself.</hi> But <hi>Christ as man,</hi> unlesse he had been in a justifiable estate, could not have been accepted with God; nor could he have been entirely happy, had he not been in favour with God. And what wil hence follow, <hi>M. Walker</hi> may easily conceive, if he be pleased so to do. Which if to acknowledge be <hi>a denial of the infinite valew of Christs d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:100644:65"/>
were able to prove and make good what herein he affirmeth. True it is indeed, that a man may be said to <hi>have need</hi> of a thing two waies: first, when a man wants somewhat, that is requisite for him to have, when he should have use of it. and so our Saviour Christ had need of meat when he was, <note n="m" place="margin">Math 4. 2.</note> hungry; and of drink, when he was <note n="n" place="margin">John 4. 6, 7. &amp; 19. 28. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </note> athirst. but so he never nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded any spirituall grace, or favour with God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when a man can not wel be without some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, the continuance whereof with him is useful and requisite for him. And so Christ, as man, may wel be said to have <hi>had need</hi> even <hi>for himself</hi> of such <hi>Righteousnes</hi> as might justifie him; (else he must have been <note n="o" place="margin">John 8. 46.</note> guilty of some sin, and <note n="p" place="margin">Joh. 9. 16, 24.</note> such <hi>a sinner,</hi> as the <hi>Pharisees</hi> unjustly charged him to be;) and of such <hi>favour with God,</hi> as should make him, and whatsoever he should do, acceptable unto God.</p>
            <p>But some question here may wel be made, what should move <hi>M. Walker</hi> thus to shape his <hi>Argument,</hi> when he comes to conclude it. For in his <hi>Proposition</hi> here, wherein his <hi>Conclusion</hi> lies couched, he quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth that, which in his <hi>Charge</hi> against <hi>M. Wotton</hi> that should make up his <hi>Assumption,</hi> with a note of restri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction there inserted, but here omitted, he had made to sound much more harshly and hainously, then as here he repeats it. For there it was that M. <hi>VVotton</hi> should hold, that <hi>Christs Obedience served ONELY to justifie himself:</hi> whereas here the word <hi>onely</hi> is wholy left out, as no part of his <hi>Argument.</hi> Was it, think we, because his conscience gave him some after-check, and told him that he had charged more upon M. <hi>VVotton</hi> then he was able to make good? Or was it because his own heart suggested unto him,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:100644:65"/>
that this was too gros and palpable a falshood to fasten upon him, who every where professeth his opinion to the contrary, affirming the merit and benefit of <hi>Christs obedience</hi> to redound also unto us? so in the very same place, as <hi>M. Walker</hi> himself also <note n="q" place="margin">Parall. Error 6. <hi>n.</hi> 2. Relat. p. 18.</note> cites him, he saith, <hi>If question be concerning the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal cause of justification, I exclude from it either obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Christ.</hi> (to wit, both <hi>active and passive.) If of the Efficient by way of merit, I maintain it to depend upon both.</hi> And his false dealing therefore therein might by his own allegations be easily discovered.</p>
            <p>But whatsoever it was that made him thus to stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, is not greatly materiall, onely it may not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usefully observed, to disclose in <hi>M. Walker</hi> that, wherewith <note n="r" place="margin">Pag. 31.</note> formerly he taxed M. <hi>Wotton;</hi> to wit, such <hi>agiddines,</hi> procured by his so oft turning round, that he forgetteth the <hi>medium</hi> of his <hi>Argument,</hi> wherein the pith of it should consist, tho laid down but two or three lines before, when he comes to conclude it.</p>
            <p>As for the charge it self, to cleare <hi>M. Wotton</hi> of Arianism (that which the divel himself, I suppose, would never have charged him with; but <note n="s" place="margin">Pag. 34.</note> 
               <hi>tho in words,</hi> saith M. <hi>Walker he professe the contrary, yet in effect he maintains;)</hi> I shal not need to say much: his <hi>Sermons</hi> extant, on the first of S. <hi>Johns Gospel</hi> wil su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraboundantly plead for him, and shew it to be a most shameles slander: unles that M. <hi>Walker,</hi> by his Chymical faculty, by which he is able to extract every thing out of any thing, can pick <hi>Arianism</hi> out of those <note n="*" place="margin">Sermons 1, 2, 3.</note> Discourses, wherein the same is very eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opposed, and as substantially refuted.</p>
            <p>From this fresh <hi>Charge,</hi> which had it been given

in, when time was, and that so strongly backt, and cleerly demonstrated, we could not possibly have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided it, but must of necessity have found <hi>M.
