            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>AS to that Objection, <hi>That the Low Interest in</hi> Holland, <hi>proceeds from their abundance of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and not the force of Laws:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I think I have sufficently answered it already in my printed Treatise: But this further may be said, which I knew not then:</p>
               <p>Laws have done it here, as hath been proved; and Laws did do it there: For the very next year after Intrest was brought from ten to eight <hi>per cent.</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> brought it by a Placart or Law to six <hi>per cent.</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi>; and the same year that the Long Parliament were about to bring it to six, they brought it to five <hi>per cent.</hi> This I have from an unerring hand: And I presume they have since brought it by a Law to four <hi>per cent.</hi> but of that I know not. However of this I am certain, Let the Law bring it to five or four at this time, &amp; the People of themselves, by encreasing the Riches of the Kingdom, will bring it to a lower ra<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is manifest in all the Progressions of Nature. As for Example: A poor man that by his Labour can but just maintain his family, with much care and diligence; if he have the good hap to light on a small stock of 50 or 100 <hi>l.</hi> or have so much given him; upon that small Foundation he may arrive to an Estate of 1000 <hi>l.</hi> it may be 10000 <hi>l.</hi> and so i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

his days for Bread onely. So it is in diseases in the Body na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; remove but the cause, take but away the Shackles of Nature, and she will soon recover strength and flesh: so take off the Burthen from Trade (whereof none is so heavy as that of Interest) and the People will work out the rest to the prodigious increase of their Riches, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> have done.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="objection">
               <head>Objection II.</head>
               <p>Another Objection I have lately met with, is, <hi>That Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is but a small Tract of Land, and consequently Land is dear there not because Interest of Money is low.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, This is a gross mistake: For Land and Interest of Money are, all over the Universe, like two Buckets; if one go up, the other must go down, and the contrary, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a great or small Territory; as is evident in our own Plantations, as well as in all other places of the World men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the former Treatise. (<hi>Viz.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Barbadoes</hi> is a small Te<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ritory, &amp; the richest in the World, ordinary Land being worth there 10 <hi>l. per ann.</hi> the Acre; Use of Mony by Law is 15 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> and their Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions sell but at seven years purchase at most. <hi>New England</hi> is a Country where the Legal Interest is eight <hi>per cent.</hi> and I am told they are now about bringing of it down to six <hi>per cent.</hi> There the Plantations will sell at fourteen to fifteen years purchase, though it be a vast Continent. In <hi>Virginia</hi> Interest is at fifteen <hi>per cent.</hi> and Plantations sell not at above seven years purchase at most, And, which is more obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, all those Places are not rich or poor according to the goodness of their Soil, but exactly according to the Rate of Interest. <hi>Barbadoes</hi> the richest Land, hath the poorest People; <hi>Virginia</hi> the next best Land, but a much poorer People than the <hi>New-English. New England</hi> incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly is the worst Land of the three, and yet the richest People of them all, and increasing dayly to a miracle, unto those
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53494:3"/>
that know not that by their Laws about Interest of Money, they must necessarily suck the Blood of the other two places, with whom they have a constant intercourse in Trade; which in effect is the same as if they lent them money. And the consequences of this to that <hi>Island of Barbadoes,</hi> are so visible and fatal, that if all the Planters or Owners of the Territory of that Island should now make up their accompts with the City of <hi>London,</hi> they would be found so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to this City, that the sale of all their Lands and Goods to their very Shirts, would not pay one half of what they owe. This I have reason to know, having as much experience of the Trade of that place, and the condition of that people, as most Merchants in <hi>London:</hi> And this I have asserted in the company of many of the most conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Barbadoes Planters</hi> now in <hi>London,</hi> who have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniously confess'd it to be true: Although most certain it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the late Sir <hi>Iames Drax,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Muddiford,</hi> Collonel <hi>Birch</hi> now of <hi>Giddy-Hall</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> and some few other Planters, have arrived there to very great Estates, after they could bring their affairs to such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency as to stem the desperate current of that interest, and row with the stream, by ceasing to borrow, and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lenders: <hi>It being the necessary and never-fayling conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a high Interest all the World over, to inrich a very few, and impoverish all the rest of the Nation:</hi> Which was the true reason that we had in former times about half a dozen such as <hi>Gresham, Sutton, Craven,</hi> and <hi>Spencer</hi>; but besides them, not one man of 10000 <hi>l.</hi> Estate, for a hundred which we have now.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="objection">
               <head>Objection III.</head>
               <p>To that Objection, <hi>That Vsurers will call in their money if it be now brought to four</hi> per cent. <hi>whereas if it be brought but to five</hi> per cent. <hi>it is hoped (by some Gentleman) that the Vsurers will be more favourable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:53494:4"/>I think that Objection is likewise fully answered in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Treatise. But to inlarge a little further upon it, I premise the Common Usurers qualifications; for of such only I speak in this place (<hi>viz.</hi>) He is always a Sly, Subtile, Wary, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, Timerous Thrifty (<hi>alias,</hi> Miserable) Person, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly well striken in years; and if this Character be true, which I submit to the Judgment of those that are better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them; Then I say it is impossible for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Usurers to call in their Money, though it be brought to four <hi>per cent</hi>: To demonstrate this, I suppose the Usurers to be of two sorts (<hi>viz.</hi>) the <hi>Country Vsurer, and the City Vsurer.</hi> Suppose likewise the Law were past to reduce Interest to four <hi>per cent,</hi> and see what the <hi>Country Vsurer</hi> will do? Very angry doubtless he will be; but what then? No question but he will threaten and talk of calling in his Money, but being no Fool but a subtile Person (as hath been said) his prudence will prompt him to consider how to mend himself, by being possest of his Money, and what to do with it when he hath it. Trade, or run it by Exchange he cannot, being too old to learn; and too wise to be cheated; as he must be sure to be; if he precipitate himself into Business he understands not: Let it lie dead by him he dares not; being possest already with several qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations that will inhibit him; Insomuch, that if he should doe it, he must never after think of Sleeping quietly; his natural timerousness being such, that every noise he hears will put him into a panick fear of Thieves come to rob him; and his Covetousness is such, that upon the very thoughts of having no Use-Money coming in, it will almost, if not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, break his heart; and then his miserableness is such, that upon the frightful Apparition of no Income, or more properly the Disappearance of all his Incomes at once, it may be feared he will go near to starve himself. What other course then can he take? I say there are but two left him in the world, <hi>Viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Either to purchase Lands, or improve those he hath.</p>
               <p>All Lands after such a Law will certainly advance six years
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53494:4"/>
purchase: So that New Purchasers shall never, by buying Lands, make 3 <hi>per cent.</hi> of their Money, and in conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the Usurers great subtilty that now directs him to t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ke 6 <hi>per cent.</hi> for his Money, rather then buy Lands at Eighteen and Ninteen years Purchase, will then advise him to continue his Money at four <hi>per cent,</hi> rather then buy Lands at twenty six years Purchase, which he must give after the making of this Law.</p>
               <p>For Improvement of his own Lands, if he take to that, I will not offer a word to hinder him; he may certainly make the best profit that way, after this Law: but what shall be called in to that purpose, I know, cannot much affect Gentlemen in Debt, because the Use-money the Usurers receive, will be sufficient to carry on that Work, being a gradual Expence without calling in the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal.</p>
               <p>The <hi>City Vsurer</hi> differs from the <hi>Country Vsurer</hi> only in this, that he hath formerly had some Experience of Trade, and hath now the opportunity of laying out his Money by Building, which the Country Usurer hath not.</p>
               <p>For the first (<hi>viz.</hi>) Trade, they have been so long out of it, that very few of them will now settle to it again them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but they will bring up their Children to it, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise they would not have done.</p>
               <p>For Building, I know many of them will be doing in that, but that likewise is a gradual Expence, somewhat like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Lands, and the great Usurers may Build an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually as much as it is convenient for one man to have in hand at one time, upon the receipt of their growing Interest only, that is let out upon <hi>Personal Security.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, I do affirm Catigorically, <hi>That in all Parts of the World where-<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ver Interest of Money is lowest; Securities
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53494:5"/>
are safest to the Lenders, and easiest to the Borrowers, and were-ever Interest of Money runs high, they are more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the Lenders, and difficult to the Borrowers.</hi> Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be true or no universally, I appeal to the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Observation of all Travelers and Merchants, so far as the Teder of my Conversation hath suffered me to range, I am sure it never failed.</p>
               <p>For Instance; in <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> it is a more difficult thing to take up 100 <hi>l.</hi> Vallew in Sugar (which is the Money of that Country) at 15 <hi>per cent.</hi> then it is to take up 1000 <hi>l.</hi> at 6 <hi>per cent.</hi> in <hi>England</hi>; the like is in Tobacco in <hi>Virginia.</hi> In <hi>Ireland</hi> the like, at the rate of that Country; with this also that whoever can be credited for 1000 <hi>l.</hi> there must give 4000 <hi>l.</hi> worth of Land for Security; whereas 2000 <hi>l.</hi> worth of Land is esteemed in <hi>England</hi> a good Security for 1000 <hi>l.</hi> Money at 6 <hi>per cent.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>There is another Objection, which I may proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call the Vsurers Objection, for I commonly meet with it from them</hi> (viz.) <hi>They say all the Money in the</hi> Nation <hi>is imployed; and although they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it not themselves, they lend to others that do, and more cannot be imployed then we have, though Interest were at three or two</hi> per cent.</p>
               <p>I answer, That no Money is imployed to the advantage of any Kingdom; but that only which is Imployed <hi>in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Trade, or by Artificers, and in Manufacture, or Improvement of Land.</hi> And that no Money is or can be Imployed in those profitable ways, but so much only as we can make above six <hi>per cent.</hi> of, as for example: A Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant in <hi>London</hi> that hath an Estate of 30000 <hi>l.</hi> or 40000 <hi>l.</hi> can hardly Imploy with all his Art and Skil above one fourth, or half at most of his said Stock in Forreign Trade to make above six <hi>per cent.</hi> because all other Trades that afford a less profit (all hazards considered) are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and must necessarily be so till Interest of Money be abated.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:53494:6"/>Whereas, were Interest of Money here at four <hi>per cent.</hi> Merchants Own Wisdom would induce them to Trade with all their Stocks; or at least so much as they could make a greater gain of then four <hi>per cent.</hi> which would be just one third more then is now imployed in Forreign Trade, or those other profitable imployments to the Kingdom.</p>

               <head>Objection, 5.</head>
               <p>Another Objection I frequently meet with, which I may not Improperly call the Merchants Obiection, because it generally comes from them (and their Language and Designs I may pretend in part to understand, if I understand any thing at all.)</p>
               <p>The said Obiection is, <hi>That we have already so many Traders, and so much Stock imployed in Trade, that we can scarce live by what we do; and if we should bring a greater Stock into Trade, which the sequel of this Law will do; and multiply Traders, no Trade will be worth the following.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I answer this Objection, I must do right to my fellow Citizens and Merchants, in confessing that although at the first starting of this Controversie in publick discourses; above ninetenths of all those I conversed with were against it; yet that since, upon reading and hearing what hath been said and printed for it, above three fourth parts of all those I have had communication with, are come over to acknowledge. <hi>That the abatement of Interest from six to four</hi> per cent. <hi>will be a real advantage to the Kingdom in general.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:53494:6"/>But further, To satisfie such as are yet in doubt, I say, Those Merchants that have great Stocks, and would have Interest continued at six <hi>per cent.</hi> if they prefer their own <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Gain</hi> to the <hi>Common Good,</hi> they are in the right as to themselves; for the abatement of Interest will certainly and necessarily increase Industry and good Husbandry; it will as certainly multiply Traders and Stock in Trade, and in conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence the gain of the present Merchant who employs his own Stock, and lends to others, will be the less. But he must be wilfully blind that cannot see the advantage of the King and Kingdom will be the more, by the multiplication of Merchants, and increase of stock in Trade, the effect &amp; success whereof in this particular (as already it hath been) will be Mathematical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the same as in the advance of Land, <hi>viz. All the Land of this Kingdom will be advanced one third in value; and the very same properties will the gain of the Kingdom be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the increase of Trade and Traders:</hi> Onely with this difference: Every individual Gentleman now possest of Lands will receive his proportional benefit thereby presently; Whereas the benefit by Trade will redound to the King and Kingdom in general, and not to the particular advantage of any of the present Merchants, except such onely as pay Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest for all or part of their Stock in Trade. But the rest of Merchants who receive not a present benefit, will partake of the future advantage thereof to themselves and Children in common with their Country: Which when well weighed and meditated upon, I am perswaded will convince those wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Merchants that are yet unreconciled to this Principle.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>But here it may be said, How shall we increase our Trade, when we cannot get by what we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:53494:7"/>If it be seriously considered, this question is answered in what I have before said. But further to explain it:</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> drive a great Trade in <hi>Salt</hi> from <hi>Rochel, St. Vvals,</hi> and other places, to the <hi>Baltick Seas</hi>; by which, if they can get eight or nine <hi>per cent.</hi> they are very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: We, while Money is at six <hi>per cent.</hi> cannot live on so small a profit as is the surplusage of that above the Interest and in consequence we look not after it, but rather choose to put out our Money at six <hi>per cent.</hi> Whereas were Money with us at four <hi>per cent.</hi> we should then be content with the surplusage of that profit, and follow it closely.</p>
               <p>But if it be here objected, from what I formerly published, <hi>That we have no such Bulky Ships to sail with little charge as the Dutch have:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, We are composed of the same Elements as they are, and have hands and heads as well as they; and that a Low interest is the cause of these and many other profi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>able Engines, which they work withal. And that he hath not half considered this point, who doth not know infallibly, <hi>That a low Interest is a Spur to Invention as well as Industry and Good Husbandry:</hi> Nay further, <hi>That it multiplies men, as well as increaseth Trade in any Nation, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter naturally generating the former.</hi>
