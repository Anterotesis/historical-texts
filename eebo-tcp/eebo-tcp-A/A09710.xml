            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:10946:4"/>
Rat, and then by that time, I hope they will be quiet.</p>
            <p>Next I find, that the Sunne entring into <hi>Taurus,</hi> it will bee exceeding good this yeere for the Butchers both in Southwarke, Eaſtcheape, and Saint <hi>Nicholas</hi> Shambles, for hee takes his entrance iuſt vpon Eaſter Tueſday, to the depoſing of Lent, and the ouerthrow of ſalt Sammon, and freſh Cod, and to the reſtoring againe of Heroick-valiant Beefe, that ancient and ſurly Courtier, that neuer appeares without a meſſe of Muſtard his Gentleman-vſher barehea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded before him: Red Herring may goe hange himſelfe then for a Tweluemonth vppon the ruſty beame of ſome Farmers chimney, vntill the hungry Ploughboyes cut him downe and quarter him: for <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Offall</hi> the Butcher will bee fatte and flouriſh, and <hi>Gregorie Gizzern</hi> the Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will bring foorth his Progenies of Partridges, Plouers, and Blacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birds, and what a pitifull ſight it will bee for poore Wayters and Trencher-bearers to ſee wiſe men their Maiſters feed vpon Woodcockes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10946:4"/>
From thence the Sunne trauailes into <hi>Gemini,</hi> not into <hi>Germanie,</hi> (as ſome Mechanicke-readers will read <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> for <hi>Gemini)</hi> and then Mayds beware of two at once, or two at a Birth, if you loue to preſerue your owne Credits, but you eſpecially this double ſigne threatnes moſt, that liue in Marchants houſes amongſt wanton Springals your Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſeruants, and are at midnight at the maſſacre, and ſacking of a Poſſet, when your ſober Maſter and continent Miſtres are in their firſt ſleepe, and little dreame of your Sinamon and Sugar, which are alwayes the two ſweete Preſenters of a Sack-Poſſet, the Sceane being layd in a Bowle, or a Baſon, and the Actors ſome halfe a dozen of ſiluer Spoones, which ſeldome are out of their parts, vntill all bee eaten: there is much perill and danger in this Signe, you Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of ſeauenteene, and one and Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: therefore if I might counſell you, you ſhould bee your owne Pothecaries, and preſerue your honeſties better than Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries: Goe to bed preſently after your Maſter and Miſtreſſe, ſaue candles and Candles,

pound, for there is craft nowe adayes in waighing of Candles, and great pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie in the vttering of Puddings.</p>
            <p>Next the Sunne takes his Iourney into the ſtinging Signe <hi>Scorpio,</hi> and then beware of Brokers, Vſurers, and Pettifoggers the Scorpions of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, come not in their villaynous clut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches all that Moneth eſpecially, for they will make you pay well for it, more in one Moneth, than you ſhall bee able to recouer againe a whole Tweluemonth after.</p>
            <p>But entring into <hi>Sagittarius,</hi> it will bee paſſing good for the Fletchers in Grubſtreet, and all the Caualeero Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, twelueſcore Prickes will be in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and thoſe may ſhoote at Bun-hill, that are non-ſuited at Weſtminſter Hall.</p>
            <p>After this the Sunne mounts into <hi>Capricorne,</hi> and then woe bee vnto you that are Horne-madde, and haue three Acres at Cuckolds Hauen, you are well landed then, for one Acre there, is more than euer you will bee able to make away as longe as you liue: This Signe

            <p>Next the Sunne enters into <hi>Aquarius,</hi> and then there will bee good dooings for Water-men, many wanton meetings at <hi>Brandford,</hi> freſh-water Voyages to Blacke-wall and Greenewich, reuelling and domineering among amiable Lads and young Wenches ouer the water: but that which I finde moſt lamentable in this watry Signe <hi>Aquarius,</hi> and moſt to be feared of all thoſe that loue valiant

Licour, is the ſingle-ſole diſpoſition of Brewers that will put to much Thames in their Beere, and I feare mee make it hop but of one legge, and that ſo lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too, that a little thing will make it hoppe quite into the Thames againe: and becauſe Ale-brewers and they are Brothers, it is as much to bee doubted on the other ſide, that each Ale-brewer will play the Iewe of <hi>Malta,</hi> and put but a little Malt in the Ale: ſo I hope there will bee fewer Red-noſes this yere than was of a Yeere a great while, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the baſer Ranke, and as for Tauerne-whiffers. I doe not thinke but the honeſt vertuous Vintners will take an order, and aſſwage the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and furious humors of their Wines, with a good ſober quantitie of faire temperate Water: nor can I much blame them, for after the Reckoning hath been diſcharged and all, you ſhould haue ſome caſt it vp againe before the Vintners face, and thinke themſelues miſreckoned in the Pottle, vntill they ſee two Gallons apparently lye vppon the floare before their eyes, and then
<pb facs="tcp:10946:6"/>
they will beleeue it, and therefore good ſober Vintners I will not condemne, but rather applaud the watring of your Wine: for by that honeſt-profitable po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, thoſe that are your common Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuckers will ſurfette and bee ſicke tenne times, ere they bee drunke once, and ſo much for the Sunnes taking Barge in <hi>Aquarius.</hi>

            <p>Many men ſhal be ſo venterouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that they ſhall go into Brothel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, and yet come out againe as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, as when they went firſt in.</p>
            <p>Bakers ſhall thriue by two thinges this yeare, ſkores well payed, and Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers that are honeſt, which are as rare to bee founde now a dayes, as blacke Swannes, and white Rauens.

            <p>The Haberdaſhers by the naturall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of this coniunction, are very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate. For olde Hats new trunde ſhall not laſt long, and new Hats for the moſt part ſhall haue olde trimming: and ſo by
