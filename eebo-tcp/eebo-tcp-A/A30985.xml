            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Bookseller's PREFACE
to the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THE Reader may be pleased to take
notice, that the following Tracts
were written by the late Eminent
and Learned Father of our Church, Dr.</hi>
Thomas Barlow, <hi>Lord-Bishop of</hi> Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln;
<hi>and printed from</hi> MSS. <hi>written with
his own Hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Occasions these.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. The Case of the Lawfulness of
Toleration of the <hi>Jews,</hi> was writ at
the Request of a Person of Quality, in
the late troublesome Times; when the
<hi>Jews</hi> made Application to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> for
their Re-admission into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. The Case of Toleration of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Dissenters, was written to, and at
the Request of the Honourable and
Learned Mr. <hi>Robert Boyle,</hi> 1660. soon
after the Restoration of K. <hi>Charles</hi> II.</p>
            <p>III. Whether it be lawful for his
Sacred Majesty K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. to reprieve
or pardon a Person, convicted and legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
condemned for Murder; written up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
occasion of Mr. <hi>St. John</hi>'s being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately
convicted for the unhappy
<pb facs="tcp:64424:3"/>
Death of Sir <hi>William Estcourt</hi> Bar.</p>
            <p>IV. The Case of Murder, in Answer
to an Objection then made, from <hi>Gen.</hi>
9. 6. <hi>That Kings have not Power to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
Murder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>V. Mr. <hi>Cottington's</hi> Case, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Validity or Nullity of his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
with <hi>Gallina,</hi> (her former Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
then living) 1671. Mr. <hi>Cotting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
applying himself, and Mr. <hi>Brent</hi>
coming from the then Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi>
to request his Lordship's Opinion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
With a further Resolution of the
same; as also the Judgments of Dr. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestrey,</hi>
Dr. <hi>Hall,</hi> (now Lord-Bishop of
<hi>Bristol</hi>) Sir <hi>Richard Lloyd,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard
Raines,</hi> Dr. <hi>William Oldys,</hi> and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of <hi>Sorbonne</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> in point of
Law and Conscience, upon the same.</p>
            <p>VI. A Breviate of the Case concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
setting up Images in the Parish-Church
of <hi>Moulton,</hi> in the Diocess and
County of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> 168 ¼. Writ upon
occasion of this Learned Bishop's being
cited before the Dean of the <hi>Arches,</hi> for
suffering such Images to be defaced, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And upon reading of which Case, so
truly and evidently stated, the whole
Prosecution (which was then violently
and virulently enough carried on) against
him was stopp'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:64424:3"/>
VII. Whether that <hi>Dominion is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on Grace,</hi> be a Tenet chargeable on
the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VIII. One Folio Leaf omitted out of
<hi>Machiavel</hi> in English, with the Bishop's
Censure thereupon.</p>
            <p>The Reader may please to observe, in
Mr. <hi>Cottington</hi>'s Case, the Counsel use
the Name of <hi>Frichinono,</hi> for the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
of <hi>Gallina,</hi> which was his proper
Name; but the Bishop that of <hi>Patrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ale,</hi>
which was the Title of his Publick Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and by which latter he was frequently
known and called by at <hi>Turin.</hi> The Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of this Case may be of great use, it
being never so fully stated before. <hi>Davila</hi>
tells us in his fifth Book,<note place="margin">Vide Hist. H. 4. France, <hi>by the Bp of</hi> Rhodes, <hi>and Monsieur</hi> D'Ossat<hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> Davila, lib. 3.</note> that <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. was
married to Q. <hi>Margaret,</hi> at <hi>Nostredame,</hi>
by the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> in Presence
of the whole Court; and she was given in
Marriage by <hi>Charles</hi> 9. her Brother: and
after a long Cohabitation, the Cardinal of
<hi>Joyeuse,</hi> the Pope's Nuncio, and the
Arch-Bishop of <hi>Arles,</hi> being delegated by
the Pope, nulled the Marriage, <hi>propter
vim &amp; metum;</hi> Q. <hi>Margaret</hi> alledging,
she was forced to it by her Brother. And
the Sentence gave liberty to the King and
Queen to marry whom they would: And
accordingly, the King afterwards married
<pb facs="tcp:64424:4"/>
               <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Medicis,</hi> one of whose Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
was <hi>Henrietta Maria,</hi> the Wife of our
K. <hi>Charles I.</hi> and Cardinal <hi>D'Ossat</hi> ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
the Legality of this Sentence, tho
there had been no Cause shewn. But the
Law of Nations does not oblige our Courts
to execute or pronounce Sentence according
to Foreign ones.</p>
            <p>Now tho the Bishop gave these Cases to
his Friends, when first writ, with his leave
to print them; yet they, fearing some of
them might prejudice his further Promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the Church in those Days, forbore
Publication of them. Tho we must do his
Lordship this Right, to aver, that he had
no regard to that: so careless was he of the
Event of any Action he thought himself
obliged to do, <hi>Religionis causâ,</hi> that he
has been often heard to say occasionally, as
a kind of Principle, viz. <hi>He who thinks
to save any thing by his Religion, but
his Soul, will be a Loser in the end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And his Lordship lived to see the Church of
<hi>England</hi> of his Opinion, in being indulgent to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters;
for in that incomparable LETTER TO
A DISSENTER, written by the best and noblest
Pen of our Age,<note place="margin">The M. of <hi>Hallifax.</hi>
               </note> and upon the Measures of that
Church, in the Reign of K. <hi>James II.</hi> the Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are told in express Words, <hi>That the Church
of</hi> England <hi>is convinc'd of its Error in being
severe to them.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now a good
while ago since
you gave me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
(for so your
Desires are, and
shall be to me) to
give you my Opinion in writing,
concerning the Toleration of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Religions, or Opinions, in a
well-governed Church and State.
And though it matters not much
what my Opinion be, and (besides
my many Disabilities both of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and Mind, the little time I have
(by reading or meditation, to
collect more, or digest those No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64424:6"/>
I have, renders me uncapable
of saying much, (or indeed any
thing which you do not know al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready;)
yet (in obedience to your
command) something I shall say,
(for, <hi>Cur me posse negem, quod tu
posse putes?</hi>) which may be an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of my confiding in your
Candor and Goodness, and of my
daring to trust you with all my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
and an evidence, not of
my ability, but willingness to serve
you. In short then, I shall give you
some of my Thoughts concerning
Toleration, tho not in that exact
order and method, not with that
clear explication, and confirmation
of the Truth, as I really desire, and
the Subject deserves.</p>
               <p>I say then,</p>
               <p>I. The Toleration we speak of,
is a Toleration of several Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or several Opinions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64424:6"/>
it: and therefore Atheists (if
there be any such) come not under
it. For he who acknowledges no
God, cannot possibly be of any
Religion, which essentially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
both an acknowledgment,
and worship of a Deity.</p>
               <p>II. Toleration of Religions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposeth
several Religions, or
different Opinions (<hi>Respectu Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinae,
Disciplinae,</hi> or both) for
without such disserent, <hi>Religions</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be <hi>different.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. Now amongst several Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
in any Nation, all cannot be
true, (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>Jamblichus</hi> tells
us truly, <hi>Truth is one, and cannot dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from it self</hi>); and that which is
owned and established by the just
Authority of any Nation, is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to be the True Religion: It
follows, that Toleration must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
relate to those Religions,
and ways of Worship, which are
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64424:7"/>
(at least supposed) false, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
different from that which
the Nation (that tolerates them)
owns, and establishes as true. I say,
<hi>supposed to be false:</hi> For it may, and
many times does happen, that the
False Religion may be established,
and the true only tolerated. So in
<hi>France</hi> Popery is the Religion own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and Protestancy only tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
in <hi>England</hi> contrary.</p>
               <p>VI. Now this <hi>Toleration,</hi> or <hi>Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment,</hi>
must relate to some (and
the same) Authority. That Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which establishes the True, must
tolerate the Religion, or Religions
which are supposed false; for we
speak of an Authoritative and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Toleration. So that as the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Legislative Power must
(and only can) legally establish
the True, so it only can tolerate
those ways of Worship which are
supposed to be false.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:64424:7"/>
V. And here further, As this Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Establishment brings a two-fold
obligation on those who sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to it; 1. An obligation to Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and a conformity in their
Practice to the Established Law:
And 2. An obligation to the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
(mentioned in the Law)
in case of Disobedience: So on the
other side, a publick, and Legal
Toleration exempts those to and
for whom it is granted,</p>
               <p>1. From the <hi>obligation to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
and conforming themselves
to the established way of Worship:
For Toleration intrinsecally notes
the taking off such Obligation.</p>
               <p>2. It exempts them from <hi>those
Punishments</hi> which are (to those
who have submitted to such a way
of Worship) the consequents of
non-obedience, and non-conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to the Established Religion.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64424:8"/>
For no man can be justly punished
for <hi>non-obedience</hi> to any Law, who
is not under the <hi>obligation</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>VI. Once more; As those to
whom such Toleration is granted,
may justly expect impunity, and
exemption from all penal Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
tho they conform not to the
way of Worship publickly esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished;
so on the other side, they
cannot reasonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the<note n="a" place="margin">Privilegia quae contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platione Religionis indulta sunt, catholicae tantum Legis observatoribus prodesse oportet: Haereticos autem &amp; Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos ab his privilegiis alienos es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se volumus. <hi>Imperat.

and Encouragements
which a Prince distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
to those who
chearfully obey, and
give conformity to
the Religion establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
For as Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are the <hi>Sepimenta Legis,</hi> the
great Mounds and Hedges to keep
men to their duty and obedience
to any Law of God, or Man, (hope
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64424:8"/>
of Reward incouraging men to
obedience, and fear of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
frighting them from disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience)
so they go together, and
are inseparable, and belong only
to those who are under the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of such Law. So that he to
whom the Law is not given, (and
to these who have a Toleration it
is not) as he need not fear punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for Non-conformity (the Law
not obliging him to it) so he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
expect, or hope for those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
which are the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of that obedience, which he
refuseth to give. Those then who
are under the obligation of such
Law, are (in one respect) in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
condition, because they may
justly expect from their Prince Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and Encouragements, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to the measure of their
Obedience: So on the other side,
those who have the Toleration, are
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64424:9"/>
(in another respect) in a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
because they need not fear
any Punishment for their Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity.</p>
               <p>7. It must be remembred, that
it is a <hi>Toleration</hi> we speak of, not
an Approbation of those Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or ways of Worship which
differ from the Religion establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a Nation. For the Established
Religion being always supposed
to be true, (and as such owned by
the Authority establishing it) the
ways of Worship tolerated only,
must of necessity be (supposed at
least to be) false, and so cannot be
approved by that Authority, which
(for just Reasons) does, and may
tolerate them. For such an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of the False, would be a
condemnation of the True Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and so, if they approve what
they tolerate, they condemn what
they establish: which is such a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64424:9"/>
contradictory piece of Indiscretion
and Injustice, as hardly any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
can be guilty of.</p>
               <p>VIII. This premised, the grand
Query will be; Whether,<note place="margin">Query.</note> and how
far the Supream Power may, and
ought to grant such a Toleration
to Religions, and ways of Worship,
differing from that established?</p>
               <p>Now seeing the granting of
such a Toleration (as almost all
other humane Actions) may be
good or bad,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Circumstances, and several
Conditions,
<list>
                     <item>1. Of the Power that grants.</item>
                     <item>2. Of the Persons to whom the
Grant is made.</item>
                     <item>3. Of the Religions tolerated.</item>
                     <item>4. And of the time in which
such Toleration is granted.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:64424:10"/>
It cannot be expected that I, (or
any body else) should give one Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
and Categorical Answer to
the intite Query: and therefore I
shall crave leave to say something
towards an Answer, by several steps
and degrees, in these following
Positions.</p>
               <p>1. Then, it is to be considered,
who they are who desire such a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration?
their number and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
at home, and what Friends and
Assistants they may have abroad.
For if the Persons desiring such
Toleration, be so considerable
for number and strength at home;
or for their assistance abroad, that
a War, or dangerous Insurrections
and Seditions may follow (if a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration
be denied) to the hazard
of the publick Peace and safety of
the Common-weal; Then (I
think) the Magistrate (in Prudence
and Conscience) may, and ought
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64424:10"/>
to grant their Desires; and rather
tolerate a False Religion (with
such prudent Qualifications, and
for such time as shall be agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
than hazard the unsettlement
and ruine of the True. For as in
the Body Natural we endure a
Gangrened Member with much
pain and patience (tho without
hopes of cure) when it cannot be
cut off without endangering the
whole; so in the Body Politick, or
Ecclesiastical, an erring part may,
and ought to be endured, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated,
when the cutting off would
hazard the weal of the whole. And
indeed such a Toleration, in such
a Case, is rather necessary than vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
in the Magistrate: only he
(in this case) makes a vertue of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
giving that (by way of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and kindness) freely, which
probably they might have by force.
Thus he secures the publick Peace,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64424:11"/>
and the Religion established, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
the Dissenters by the civility
and courtesie of a moderate Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
and yet all this is indeed
but granting impunity, when he
cannot punish. And this is most
consonant to the Principles of right
Reason, and the perpetual Practice
of all Nations. For <hi>Quod multis
peccatur inultum est;</hi> when Seditions
have happened in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal,
or Mutinies in an Army,
if the Seditious and Mutineers
were many, it hath ever been
thought more prudent to pardon,
than punish. <hi>Multitudo peccantium
poenam tollit, licet non peccatum.</hi> As it
is impossible to punish universally,
so 'tis ever dangerous to punish a
major, or any great and considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
part of a Community<note n="a" place="margin">Minutius Felix Octav. <hi>pag.</hi> 77.</note> 
                  <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensio
communis furoris est, furentium
multitudo.</hi> And (I believe) whereever
Protestants are tolerated in Popish
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64424:11"/>
or Catholick Countries, 'tis from
this principle, That they do not
think it prudent or safe for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
to persecute the Protestants
within their Territories. It has
been (and is) the opinion of wise
men, that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> by a mild
and moderate Toleration might
have compassed that in the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
at the beginning, which (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
taking the contrary way)
hath cost him so vast a proportion
of Treasure and Blood, and is
not compassed yet, nor ever like
to be. This particular will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
in the present condition
of this Kingdom, wherein (by the
unhinging of all Government, and
an unhappy Civil War) Papists,
Schismaticks and Sectaries, are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied
into so great a number, that
possibly it may be more safe for
the publick to pardon than punish,
to grant a moderate Toleration,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64424:12"/>
than run the hazard of further divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and bloodshed. This I only
propose (in <hi>thesi</hi>) to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
But (in <hi>hypothesi</hi>) what is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
most fit to be done in this
time and Nation, I shall not be so
confident as to undertake the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination,
but (according to my
duty) leave it to the great prudence
of those to whom God has given a
greater measure of understanding
and authority for such a business;
and constantly pray for a blessing
upon their endeavours in setling
this divided Nation.</p>
               <p>2. But admit that the numbers
of those who dissent from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
established in a Nation, be
not so great, nor their Qualities
and Assistants so considerable, as
that the State need fear any new
War, or publick disturbance; Is
the Magistrate then bound in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and piety to punish, or may
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64424:12"/>
he (without violation of either)
tolerate? To answer this, we
must consider,
<list>
                     <item>1. The nature of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to be inflicted.</item>
                     <item>2. The nature of the false Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions
or Opinions for
which they are inflicted.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The first; All punishments to
be inflicted, are either Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
or Civil: The

                     <item>1. <hi>Spiritual, in foro interno, ex

and are <gap reason="foreign">

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the first of these, I say
further, that the Church has no
Commission from Christ or his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64424:13"/>
Apostles, or any practice of the
Primitive Church, to punish any
man, either</p>
               <p>1. With loss of <hi>Livelihood,</hi> by Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary

               <p>2. Nor loss of <hi>Liberty</hi> by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment.</p>
               <p>3. Nor loss of <hi>Life</hi> by Capital

               <p>The saying is old, and true,
(admitted by all sober Protestants)
<hi>Dominium non fundatur in gratia.</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
and Infidels have a good ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to their Patrimonies, and a just
propriety in their Estates real or
Personal; to become Christians,
neither gives them a new, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
their old title. So that if
they turn Hereticks, or (which is
worse) Infidels, they do not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
their livelihood (much less
their<note n="*" place="margin">

may (<hi>per modum paenae</hi>) take away
what (on condition) they gave, if
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64424:13"/>
that condition be not made good.
Our admission into the Church by
Baptism, gives us Communion
with the Church, and a right to
all those Spiritual advantages for
Heaven, which are dispensed in it
(as hearing the Word, receiving
the Sacrament, Absolution upon a
serious and real penitence, &amp;c.)
these the Church gave, and (for
heresie or impiety) may take away,
but no more. If any Bishop or
Church-Officers have any further
power (as to imprison, lay Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary
Mulcts, <hi>&amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>) this they have
<hi>ex Indulgentiâ Principum,</hi> not from
Christ, but the Civil Power of the
Commonwealth where they live.</p>
               <p>2. This being so, I observe
further, that the persons we now
speak of (as Papists, Schismaticks,
and Sectaries) dissenting from the
Established Religion, need no to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration
or grant of Impunity, as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64424:14"/>
to <hi>Church-Censures,</hi> or Spiritual pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments;
as not being liable, or
any way obnoxious to them. For
the Church having no power to
punish any save those of her own
Body, (by Penance, Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) of which the persons
we now speak, are not (as neither
acknowledging the Churches
power, nor living in Communion
with her) it follows, that as she hath
no power to punish them (they not
being Members of her Body) so
they have no need of a Toleration,
or Act of Impunity, as to Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
punishments, to which (on
the supposition now made) they
are not obnoxious. And if the
Church should Excommunicate
them, it were but (at least) in their
opinion, <hi>Brutum fulmen,</hi> and <hi>vanae,
&amp; sine viribus Irae.</hi> they would va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
the Excommunication of our
Church, no more than we value
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64424:14"/>
theirs, that is, nothing at all.</p>
               <p>3. So then, the Impunity this
Toleration (we nowspeak of) must
give, is from temporal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
inflicted by the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate.
Now before we can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
what Impunity such a
Magistrate may give to men of a
false Religion (for so all differing
from that publickly Established,
are in this case presumed, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be) we must consider the
nature and condition of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
or Opinions to be tolerated.
And here I conceive,</p>
               <p>1. That no State should or will
grant a toleration to any Religion,
which contains any thing in it
which may be destructive to the
Civil peace and safety of it self.
<hi>Salus</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">By [<hi>Populus</hi>] I understand the whole Body Politick, <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Members, King</hi> and <hi>People;</hi> and not the <hi>People</hi> only in opposition to the <hi>King.

utmost end of all Authority. This
publick safety, may and must be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured,
though (if there be no other
way) with the ruin of Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.
For as in the Body Natural,
if Fingers or Toes, Legs or Arms,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> are so corrupted and gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grened
that they indanger the
whole body, <hi>Ense recidantur,</hi> &amp;c.
they are not to be tolerated, but
torn off. So in the Body Politick,
or Commonweal, if any persons
maintain such a Religion as is not
consistent with the publick safety,
as it were imprudence in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
to grant, so it were irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
for them to ask or expect a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration.
For why should any
power tolerate that which will
ruin it self? Upon this account it
will be hard to tolerate</p>
               <p>1. Such <hi>Anabaptists</hi> as deny all
Magistracy (for such there have
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64424:15"/>
been, and are) for why should
any Prince own and protect them
as subjects, who will not obey, or
own him as their Prince?</p>
               <p>2. Such as make it a part of
their Religion, to believe all Oaths
unlawful, and so will take none,
(for such there are, whether really
or in pretence I know not) for on
this account they will refuse all
Oaths of Allegiance. And then
what tye or obligation can the
Prince lay upon them, whereby
he may be secured of their Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
And then why should a Prince
secure them (by a Toleration of
Impunity) who will not secure
him of their Loyalty.</p>
               <p>3. Such (especially if their
number be considerable) as by the
Principles of their Religion, think
all War unlawful (as being contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
to the charity of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel)
and by consequence must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64424:16"/>
their Prince any Personal assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in his Wars, though he and
his Kingdom be in the utmost ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
and necessity. For if Subjects
be once of this opinion (that they
will not fight for their King and
Country) the Prince is left to be
inevitably ruined by the next In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader:
It being an easie matter
to ruin that Prince whose Subjects
will not fight for his preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>4. Such, who (although they
allow and will take an Oath of

And indeed, the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating

the murdering of great <hi>Navarre</hi> in
<hi>France</hi> (approved by the Pope in

In <hi>England,</hi> are sad Examples of
this truth; too evident to be false,
and too fresh to be forgotten.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64424:18"/>
the Pope cannot dispose of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Kingdoms <hi>Directè</hi> and <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nariè,</hi>
but only indirectè (<hi>in ordine
ad spiritualia</hi>) and <hi>extraordinarie:</hi>
which is no solution, but a plain
concession of what we object. For
if he may do it <hi>extraordinariè</hi> and
<hi>Indirectè,</hi> then 'tis evident he may
do it (in their opinion) and then
how can a King be secured against
the rebellion of such Subjects, and
his own deposition, that one side
of the distinction cannot do it, so
long as the other may? Whether
it be done <hi>directè</hi> or <hi>indirectè,</hi> 'tis
all one, he is deposed. If my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
should tell me he could not
run me thorough with the one
end of his Sword (meaning the
Hilt) what security were that to
me, when he may do it with the
point? If I am kill'd, 'tis no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which end of the Sword did it.
Sure I am, as my enemy (if he
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64424:18"/>
have a mind to kill me) will make
use of the point of his Sword, so
the Pope well knows which side
of the distinction to make use of
when he has a mind to do mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
               <p>I do not speak this against all
Papists, as if none of them could
be good Subjects, (for I both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and know the contrary) but</p>
               <p>1. I do not see how the Jesuits
and those who believe and own
their Principles (who are indeed
the Puritans of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church)
can be good Subjects to a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Prince, or capable of a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration,
without indangering the
publick peace and safety of the
Commonweal.</p>
               <p>2. And that others are good
subjects (as I know some are) it is
to be imputed more to their piety
and personal goodness, than the
principles of their Religion, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

of which (as might easily and

               <p>2. And as no King (in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence)

               <p>2. They must not only be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd

                  <hi>Lipsus</hi> (on that

you see, the reason why Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
(though certainly a crime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64424:21"/>
the Law of Nature) was not
punished, but tolerated… <hi>Quia
difficilis erat incertae rei aestimatio.</hi> It
was very hard to know when a
man was ingrateful, and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of his ingratitude, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hard to punish it. All just
punishments consisting in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
between the sin and the
suffering of the person punished,
which cannot possibly be known,
unless the nature and measure of
the crime be first known. 'Tis
true (<hi>in thesi</hi>) that all know and
confess Ingratitude is a great crime,
but (<hi>in Hypothesi</hi>) whether <hi>Titius</hi>
be ingrateful to <hi>Sempronius,</hi> and
how far, 'tis hard (if not impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
to know; seeing that cannot
be known, unless all the Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
and injuries which each have
done to other mutually, could
certainly be (as indeed they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be) comprehended. By the way,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64424:21"/>
when <hi>Seneca</hi> saith, that <hi>in nullâ (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepta
Macedonum) gente, adversus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratum
dabatur Actio,</hi> and so not in
<hi>Rome;</hi> he speaks this of his own
time. For afterwards Ingratitude
(by the<note n="*" place="margin">Institut. de Capitis dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut. L. Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</note> 
                  <hi>Roman</hi> Law) was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
punished, even with <hi>Maxima
capitis Diminutio,</hi> by which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful

amisit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Upon these grounds some
Sects amongst us, can have little
reason to expect (and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
as little to grant) a tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or impunity. As,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Adamites</hi> (such there were)
who held a promiscuous use of
women.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Quakers</hi> who give no civil
respect to any, no not the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
but curse and rail, and damn
all but their own Disciples. These
Crimes being evidently against
nature, and inconsistent with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64424:22"/>
(much more with Christian)
Society, are not to be tolerated,
but severely punished. It were
vain to reason or dispute with such
men, who have cast off all civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and even humanity it self; <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentum
baculinum,</hi> is the fittest
means<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (if not to convert, yet) to
keep them within some bounds of
reason and civility, that they may
not make others worse, if they
will not be better themselves.</p>
               <p>5. These things considered
(which relate to matter of fact,
and the actions of persons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
a false Religion) we come
now to the main Query, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
matter of Faith and false
Opinions:<note place="margin">Query.</note> Whether men of a
false faith and heretical opinions,
may be tolerated, and have a grant
of Impunity, or whether the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
is to punish such erring
persons? (suppose Sectaries, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64424:22"/>
Socinians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then
how far, how long, with what
punishments, and what measure
and degrees of them he is to do it?
for instance, Whether he may pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
them,</p>
               <p>1. In their <hi>Purse</hi> only, by Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary
Mulcts, taking away some
part, or all their Livelihood.</p>
               <p>2. Or in their <hi>persons</hi> too, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away either,</p>
               <p>1. Their <hi>liberty</hi> by <hi>imprisonment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Or their <hi>City</hi> (the <hi>jus Civita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi>)
by <hi>Banishment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Or their <hi>Life,</hi> by Capital
punishments, as the <hi>Donatists</hi> and
<hi>Circumcellians</hi> of old, and they of
<hi>Rome</hi> (of late) use those whom
commonly they miscall Hereticks,
consuming those to ashes whom
they cannot confute otherwise
than with Fire and Faggot; a way
not only incongruous, but impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and barbarous, whereby they
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64424:23"/>
may make men coals and cinders,
but not Christians. I say the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is, (supposing those of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
differing from that establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
to be otherwise peaceable
and good Subjects, neither rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
or seditiously disturbing the
publick peace, nor injuriously
wronging their neighbour, for in
these cases it is irrational for them
to expect, or the Magistrate to
grant impunity, Whether the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
may justly grant them a
Toleration of their Opinions and
Religion (though at least supposed
false) or compell them by punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to the Established way of
Worship, which is supposed true
and Orthodox?</p>
               <p>In answer to this,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> though I
shall not say, that it is absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unlawful for the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
(in this case) to use tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and compulsory, punishments,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64424:23"/>
yet thus much (giving my reasons
for it) I think I may safely and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
say, that it will be very difficult
and dangerous for him to do it. My
reasons are,</p>
               <p>1. Because we find no <hi>Warrant</hi>
for it in the Gospel; there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any <hi>precept</hi> or <hi>practice</hi> of our
Saviour, or his Apostles, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
any to be Christians. The
means they used, either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
Pagans, or continue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
Christians, were constant
Preaching, and a rational pressing
that truth to others, which they
had received from God, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
themselves, a prudent and
meek disputing, and reasoning
men out of their Errors, a pious
life and patient suffering for the
truth they Preached: <hi>Verbo &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplo
agebant, non gladio,</hi> it was their
Christian patience, not any coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
violence which converted
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64424:24"/>
the world, it was dying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
not killing others which
planted and propagated the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel;
<hi>Sanguis Martyrum semen Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae,</hi>
it was the blood of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi>
not of murdered Hereticks,
which made the field of the
Church so fruitful; and by what
authority we should do that now,
which they thought not fit to do
then, I know not. Certainly, as
they best knew what means were
most proportionable, and congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
both for the plantation and
propagation of the Gospel, so we
have reason to believe that those
<hi>mediums</hi> they made use of, were
such; and (on the other side) we
may rationally conclude, that had
there been any other means as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous
and conducible to the end
they aimed at, as those they used,
they would not have omitted
them. Seeing then neither Christ
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64424:24"/>
nor his Apostles ever commanded,
or (by their example or practice)
commended violence, or any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active
means to make or confirm
Christians, we have great reason to
believe, that they conceived such
means not congruous; and if so,
why should any think otherwise?<note place="margin">Object.</note>

Infidelity, or any other sin, how
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64424:25"/>
and when he will; so he punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> with death:
But we deny that man (the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate)
can do so, <hi>Jure Ordinario.</hi>
It is true, it was our Saviour which
punished <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 9. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>I am Jesus whom thou
persecutest;</hi> and so it may seem,
that we have our Saviour's exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for coactive punishments. But
then we must consider our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;
1. In the state of Humility,
while he was here: 2. In the state
of Glory after his Ascension. The
Punishment of St. <hi>Paul</hi> was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Act of our Saviour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Ascension, when he was in
the state of Glory, and so can be
no good warrant or foundation of
an <hi>Ordinary Power</hi> and <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> in
any man here to do the like. For
certainly there is little Logick in
this consequent, <hi>Our glorified Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
by his absolute power, extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
punished Paul with blindness:</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:64424:26"/>
Ergo, <hi>The Magistrate here may ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
do it.</hi> The thing we deny, is,
that our Saviour while he was
here (in the state of Humility) hath
left us any precept or example for
coactive punishments: He tells us,
that <hi>his Kingdom was not of this
world;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 18. 36.</note> it was not a Temporal, but
Spiritual Kingdom, and so the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of Justice in it, was
not by Temporal, but Spiritual pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments.
His too zealous Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
would have had fire call'd
for from Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but he
tells them <hi>that he came not to destroy,
or take away any mans life, but to
save it;</hi> and I believe he did not
delegate that power to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
(not to <hi>Peter</hi>) which he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did, nor had Commission to
use himself. 4. For the Examples of
<hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> and <hi>Elimas,</hi>
they are as impertinent to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
for which they bring them,
as that of <hi>Paul:</hi> For,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:64424:26"/>
1. They were punished for
matter of fact, not of faith or opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
concerning Religion; <hi>Ananias</hi>
and <hi>Sapphira</hi> for Sacriledg, and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
God and his Church of the
Consecrated things, and <hi>Elimas</hi> for
perverting by Sorceries, and sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Christians; (as by the Text
appears) in which cases we do not
plead for impunity.</p>
               <p>2. Their punishment was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
and miraculous from
the hand of Heaven, not of any
man or Magistrate. This is clear
in the death of <hi>Ananias;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 5. 3, 4, 5.</note>and tho
<hi>Peter</hi> may seem to have had a
hand in <hi>Sapphira</hi>'s death, yet those
words (<hi>vers.</hi> 6.) are <hi>praedicentis, non
infligentis poenam,</hi> he only foretells
her, <hi>that the hand of God</hi> (not his)
<hi>would be upon her.</hi> And so it was
too with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Elimas, The hand
of the Lord shall be upon thee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 13. 11.</note> &amp;c.
'Tis the hand of the Lord (not
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64424:27"/>
his) that made him blind; <hi>Paul</hi>
(as a Prophet) foretold, what God
(as a just Judg) did. However, 'tis
(beyond dispute) evident, that those
punishments of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Elimas</hi>
were <hi>Extraordinary</hi> and <hi>Miraculous;</hi>
and therefore cannot possibly be
any just foundation of an <hi>ordinary</hi>
jurisdiction. But too much of this,
for (to me) these examples seem al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
impertinent, and though
often urged, yet to little purpose,
seeing they prove nothing, save
that (sure) they wanted better ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,

               <p>3. It is certain and confessed,

that in this Parable the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are

Christians] there are several
express places in the Gospel which
strongly perswade the contrary;
that no violence or coaction is, or
ought to be used; so when some

Lastly, (as to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Hereticks with death) our
Saviour seems to resolve the case
(in express terms) that they ought
not so to suffer death, though
they were Hereticks. It is in the
Parable of the<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 13. 28, 29.</note> 
                  <hi>Tares,</hi> where
he tells the servants, that they
must suffer the <hi>tares</hi> to grow with
the <hi>wheat</hi> (Hereticks with<note n="b" place="margin">Vers. 38.</note> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks)
till the Harvest (the<note n="c" place="margin">Vers. 39.</note>
end of the world) and he gives the
reason of it, <hi>Lest the wheat be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered
by the extirpation of the
tares.</hi> How far the <hi>Romish</hi> Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
(and others who punish He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
with death) fulfill or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
this advice, let the world

judg. Sure I am, this precept,
[<hi>Let them grow together till the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest</hi>]
and their practice, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory.
He that consumes He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
with fire and faggot, does
not let them grow and continue
with Catholicks; Unless an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
eradication of the Tares be a
continuation of them with the
Wheat, which would be an expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
like that in the Gloss of the

               <p>By such means men are rather
confirmed in their opinions than
confuted, as is evident in the
Christians of the Primitive times,
when Christianity thrived, and
Christians were multiplied by
persecution; so that the Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
many made more. The
Church (in this) like old <hi>Rome</hi> in
the Poet:
<q>
                     <l>Per damna, per caedes ab ipso</l>
                     <l>Ducit opes, animumque ferro.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>He that suffers persecution, and
boldly dies for his Religion and
Opinions, (be they what they

esteemed a Martyr, not a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64424:31"/>
and such suffering is so
far from a confutation, that it is
indeed a great confirmation of
them in their opinions; <hi>Crescit ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versis
fides,</hi> and a motive to make
others imbrace them. The
Massacre in <hi>France</hi> made more
Protestants in one night, than
all <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Works have done
since their first publication,
And <hi>Erasmus</hi> observes, that a

and punishment, he that would
justly proportion this to that, must
first know the crime, and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the malice contained in it,
the mischief done by it, else 'tis
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64424:32"/>
impossible he should proportion a
just punishment for it. Now I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it very difficult, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
for any man certainly to
know how far Erroneous opinions
in Religion, or Herefies, (as they
call them) are sinful. For,</p>
               <p>1. No Heresie, or erroneous
opinion can be sinful, unless it be
voluntary. That of Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi>
is an universally and justly
received principle; <hi>Peccatum non
est peccatum, nisi sit voluntarium:</hi>
There is no malice in the mind or
will unless it be voluntary. But
now how far the Errors of <hi>Titius</hi>
and <hi>Sempronius</hi> are voluntary, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they proceed from weakness
or wilfulness; and what degree of
weakness or wilfulness they have,
none (I believe) does, or can know
(without Divine Revelation) but
he that knows the heart, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
none (but he) can justly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64424:33"/>
such Errors, because not
knowingly; and this is the reason
which<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>Seneca</hi> gives, why Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
was not punishable by any
Law in his time, <hi>Quia difficilis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat
Incertae rei aestimatio,</hi> it was (to
them) so difficult to know the
measure and degrees of Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
that they did not dare to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
it, but left it, <hi>Odio hominum
&amp; vindictae Deorum,</hi> who only knew
the measure of the fault, and so
the means justly to punish it, for
although (in <hi>Thesi</hi>) all men by the
light of Natural Reason knew,
and confest <hi>Ingratitude</hi> to be a fault,
yet (in <hi>Hypothesi</hi>) how far this, or
that man (in particular) is guilty
of that fault, is very difficult, if not
impossible to be known by any,
save him who knows the heart.</p>
               <p>2. It is a known and received
truth by all Lawyers and Divines
generally, that no <hi>positive</hi> Law of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64424:33"/>
God or man does, or can bind us,
without a sufficient promulgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
such a sufficient Promulgation
being necessary to the obligation
of all positive Laws. But now,
when the positive truths of the
Gospel are sufficiently revealed
and romulgated to <hi>Titius</hi> and
<hi>Sempronius</hi> (to this and that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
person) is difficult, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for any man to know, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he could know the divers abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and capacities of those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to whom those Truths are
published. For as those Pagans
to whom the Gospel was never
revealed (as to many Nations it
never was) are no way under the
obligation of it, nor any way lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to sin, or punishment for not
believing it (whence that saying
of <hi>Augustine</hi> speaking of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,<note place="margin">Augustinus.</note>

contra naturam.</hi> So amongst
those to whom it has been reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
there is a great difference in
respect of the sufficiency or insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency

may be a sufficient promulgation
to one, which (their capacities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered)
is not to another, and so
the error of one be a crime, when
the other, tho holding the same

to consume diffenting Brethren

this is that which none should, and

This <hi>self-separation</hi> may be known,
but <hi>self-condemnation</hi> cannot, and
therefore the Apostle speaks not
of this, but that. And I am the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
induced to be of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:</p>

And (if <hi>Stephanus</hi> mistake not) to

of it.</p>
               <p>2. Because I find <hi>Justellus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Christoph. Justellus &amp; Grotius locis supra citatis.</note> and

saith thus,
<hi>Non dicit Excommunica, nam ipsi ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro

<hi>Hierome</hi> more fully,<note place="margin">Hieronimus in Tit. 3. 10. pag. 209. Col. 2. C.</note> 
                  <hi>Propterea à

&amp;c. So that (in St. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s
opinion) the Heretick Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
speaks of, is such a one, who (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
his Erroneous opinion) is
Schismatical, and not only makes
a separation from the Church him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
but seduces others, to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance
of the publick peace;
which crime is visible, and confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64424:40"/>
punishable. However, tis
certain, we may know, and avoid
all familiarity with such a person,
which is all which that Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Injunction [<hi>Haereticum devita</hi>]
signifies. And so much for that
passage in St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. For the <hi>practice</hi> of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church in punishing those
they call'd Hereticks with Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications,
I confess tis true,
they did so. But then, 1. It will
not hence follow, they did well
and justly in doing so. <hi>Afacto ad
jus, non sequitur argumentum.</hi> We
cannot infer, <hi>Illos justè fecisse, ex eo
quod fecerint.</hi> Nay he that reads the
ancient Church-story, will find
that even those ancient Christian
Bishops (though otherwise good
men) were oft times too precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
and passionately hot, and
fierce against their Brethren, and
too free of their Anathematismes
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64424:40"/>
and Excommunications (although
they were not then come to the
now practised Popish cruelty of
confuting Hereticks with fire and
faggot.) As is evident in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
story of Pope <hi>Victor</hi> (to omit
others) Excommunicating the <hi>Asi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Bishops for their Observation of
<hi>Easter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Euseb. Hist. Eccles. lib.</note> though no Law of God or
man obliged them to keep it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than they then did. 2. Yet I
grant, that the <hi>Church</hi> anciently did,
and still justly may <hi>punish</hi> an <hi>erring
person</hi> with <hi>Excommunication</hi> (altho
they cannot be certain how far,
and in what measure such persons
err culpably;) and yet neither
Church or State can justly punish
such persons with loss of Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
Liberty, or Life. So (I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose)
an <hi>Arian,</hi> or one who denies
the Resurrection (though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
peaceable, neither separating
himself, nor factiously seducing
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64424:41"/>
others) may justly be Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
by the Church, because
he does not keep the Conditions
on which he had the Christian
Communion. He that has the
grant of any Communion (Sacred
or Civil) upon Conditions, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be Excommunicated justly
while he keeps those Conditions,
but if he do not, then (<hi>conditione
non praestitâ</hi>) he may be justly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate.
Now Christians
anciently; (and in ours, and all
Churches) were received into the
Communion of the Church, on
Condition of believing the Creed
(or Faith into which they were
Baptized.) The Priest at Baptism
asked, <hi>Dost thou believe in God the
Father Almighty?</hi> &amp;c. The party
Baptized answered (by himself, if
he were of age, by his Sureties,
if not) <hi>All this I stedfastly believe.</hi>
Then the Priest demands further,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64424:41"/>
                  <hi>Wilt thou be Baptized into this Faith?</hi>
He answers, <hi>That is my desire,</hi> &amp;c.
Upon these Conditions he was
received into the Church, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into the Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.
Now if after Baptism,
and this promise, he deny any of
those Fundamental Articles into
the belief of which he was Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
(though otherwise he lived
never so peaceably) he might just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be Excommunicated by the
Church. 'Tis a good and true Rule
in Morality (and Divinity too)
<hi>Volenti non fit injuria,</hi> he desired,
and had the Communion on that
Condition; and when he rejects,
and does not make good that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
the Church may justly eject
him by Excommunication, (tho
they cannot distinctly know the
measure and degrees of the malice
that is in such error, it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for any man certainly to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64424:42"/>
know whether he err out of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and infirmity, or malice and
obstinacy.) And further, every
such person may be call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, (as the<note n="*" place="margin">Tit. 3. 10.</note> Apostle here,

                  <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and others after him call
all Hereticks) not because they
maintain an error against their
Conscience, (for certainly many
do not, and when any do, none
can possibly know, but he who
knows the heart) but because (as
<note n="*" place="margin">Nic. de Lyr. in Tit. 3. 10.</note>
                  <hi>Lyranus</hi> tells us) <hi>Fidem quam in
baptismo recepit ut veram, nunc con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnat
ut falsam.</hi> He condemns
that Faith now, (and so himself)
which before he professed as true.
So that he is said to condemn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<hi>Non respectu judicis interni,</hi>
(for he may at both those times,
think he is in the right) but <hi>respectu
professionis, &amp; facti externi;</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
that as true at one time,
which he himself condemns (as
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64424:42"/>
false) at another. And so the same
person at several times, approving
and condemning the same Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
may (properly enough) be
said to condemn himself, seeing
he now disapproves and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
what before he approved.
Lastly, (which is no little preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
against punishing for Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
in the Primitive and purer
times of Christianity, we find no
persecution for Religion (except
by Pagans.) The <hi>Arians</hi> (amongst
the Professors of Christianity) were
the first who used it. So<note n="*" place="margin">Athanas. Ep ad Solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam Vitam agentes O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perum Tom. 1.</note>

I am, neither our Saviour nor his

would give a Toleration to seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Religions, should not (in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and conscience) first know
what these Religions are, what
Points they hold different from
that Established, that so he may
knowingly judg how far he may,
or may not grant Impunity? For
if he Tolerate a Religion before
he know it, he Tolerates he knows
not what: Which cannot be an
act of prudence in any Magistrate.
Seeing (in this case) he grants a
Toleration to that Religion, which
(for ought he knows) he ought
not to Tolerate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quer.</hi> 2. Whether he that does
(and justly may) Tolerate a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
different from that Legally
established, and so compells none
to be of his Religion, may not yet
compell his Subjects to those <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi>
(and the use of them) by which
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64424:49"/>
may be informed of the reasons
and truth of his Religion? As (for
instance) whether our King, though
he should grant a Toleration to
Papists, and so no way compell
them to be Protestants, may not
compel them to come to Sermons,
and hear Disputations, by which
they may be informed of those
Truths we hold, and the Grounds
and Reasons of them. (As Parents
compell their Children to go to
School for Information, though
they should not, cannot compell
them to an assent, and belief of
what they are taught.) Seeing (by
the Law of Nature and Scripture)
we and all men are bound to <hi>Try
all things, and hold fast that which is
good;</hi> and so may (by our Lawful
Governours) be compell'd to an
examination and rational trial of
several Religions, though not to
the belief of any? Now the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:64424:50"/>
of this difference in this, 1. It
is evident (and confessed) that 'tis
every man's duty to make such
trial of the truth of several Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
that so he may be of the best
Religion by choice, and not only
by chance. 2. It is as evident,
that the end of Magistracy is to
bring all men under their Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to do their duty, either by
suasory allurements; or (if that
will not do) by compulsory pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,
and so (by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence)
he may compell them to
such trial of the truth. 2. But
after such trial made (by hearing
Sermons and Disputations) the
Magistrate cannot tell certainly,
when it is their duty (of several
Religions) to believe this, or that
in particular; for 'tis no man's
duty to believe any positive truth
of Christian Religion, till it be
sufficiently revealed (a sufficient
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:64424:50"/>
revelation of truth being abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary, and antecedent
to an obligation to believe it, and
so to the duty of believing) and
when that is, the Magistrate can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
certainly know; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he cannot compell any to the
belief of these or those opinions
(as a part of their duty) seeing he
cannot certainly know, whether
it be their duty or no.</p>

man's blood, by man shall his blood be
shed.</hi> Wherein God Almighty <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points
death</hi> to be the <hi>punishment</hi> of
<hi>Murder.</hi> Now if it be granted,
that the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Law binds <hi>only
the Jews,</hi> to whom it <hi>was given;</hi> yet
<hi>this Law</hi> given <hi>to Noah,</hi> and in him,
to <hi>all his Posterity;</hi> must bind <hi>Jews</hi>
and <hi>Gentiles</hi> too, who are <hi>all equally
his Posterity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> In answer to this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the reason of it, (which
<hi>no way proves</hi> what is <hi>pretended</hi>) I
say,</p>
               <p>1. It is <hi>confess'd, that this Law
given to Noah, did bind him and all
his Posterity.</hi> There were <hi>three men</hi>
(and but three) who could <hi>make
Positive Laws,</hi> to <hi>bind all the World.</hi>
1. <hi>Adam. 2. Noal. 3. Our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Saviour.</hi> Whatever Laws any
<hi>of them made,</hi> (after <hi>sufficient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation</hi>)
oblig'd the <hi>whole World;</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:64424:53"/>
and <hi>what Laws God gave to Adam or
Noah, all such Laws,</hi> (after <hi>suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Promulgation</hi>) oblig'd <hi>their Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi>
that is, the <hi>whole World;</hi> (for
as before the Flood, <hi>all the men in
the World came from Adam;</hi> so after
the Flood from <hi>Noah;</hi> and it must
be confess'd, that although this
Law <hi>given to Noah,</hi> does not <hi>bind
many,</hi> to whom it <hi>was never</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulg'd
or <hi>made known;</hi> yet God
has <hi>sufficiently made it known to all
Jews and Christians,</hi> in the holy
Scriptures; and therefore we must
confess our selves under the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of it.</p>
               <p>2. It is certain, that this Law
<hi>given to Noah,</hi> was (as all <hi>Penal
Laws are</hi>) a <hi>Positive Law;</hi> and that
<hi>all such Laws</hi> are <hi>capable of Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
and that in <hi>several Cases,</hi>
(<hi>without any dispensation</hi>) their <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
ceases:</hi> of which more
anon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:64424:54"/>
3. It is certain, that by these,<note place="margin">Numb. 35. 30.</note>
words [<hi>By man shall his blood be
shed</hi>] <hi>By man</hi> there, the <hi>Magistrate</hi>
is meant, who had <hi>Jus Gladii,</hi>
Power of <hi>Life and Death;</hi> and so
<hi>Authority to condemn and execute a
Murderer;</hi> which no <hi>Private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
had, or could upon any just
Grounds pretend to.</p>
               <p>4. When it is said, <hi>That the
Murderers blood shall be shed by man:</hi>
The Proposition is not <hi>Universal,</hi>
that <hi>every Murderer</hi> shall be put to
<hi>death.</hi> For if <hi>Noah,</hi> or any <hi>Supreme
Power</hi> had been a <hi>Murderer, (as even
David the best of Kings was)</hi> he <hi>could
not by this</hi> or <hi>any other Law</hi> be put to
<hi>death.</hi> 1. Because it is evident
that the <hi>Supreme Power</hi> has no <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior,</hi>
and therefore none to <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
him,</hi> especially not with <hi>death,</hi>
the greatest <hi>Punishment</hi> man can
<hi>suffer.</hi> 2. Nor could he do it <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi>
for although <hi>Kings</hi> and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64424:54"/>
Powers have <hi>Authority to
take away other mens lives,</hi> (when
they are <hi>Capital Offenders,</hi> and do
things <hi>worthy of death</hi>) yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
take away their own; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
or <hi>Self-murder,</hi> being in <hi>no case</hi>
lawful. 3. And as they could
not without sin and great Impiety,
<hi>kill themselves;</hi> so they could not
give <hi>Commission to any to do it.</hi> It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impossible that <hi>I should give
another Power</hi> to do that, which I
<hi>had no power to do my self.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. And as this Law extends not
to Supreme Powers; whose <hi>Blood
cannot be shed by man,</hi> although man's
Blood have <hi>been shed by them;</hi> so
it extends not to all <hi>Subjects</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
persons,</hi> who have Lawful
Magistrates. This the infinitely
wise and <hi>just Lawgiver</hi> (<hi>God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>)
has <hi>told us</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 21. 20, 21.</note> 
                  <hi>That if
a Master had slain his Man-servant,
or Maid-servant, and they die immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64424:55"/>
under his hand,</hi> then he was to be
<hi>punish'd;</hi> but if that Servant lived a
day or two, (24 hours, say the
<hi>Rabbins,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 11. 9.</note> the <hi>Jews</hi> accounting 12.
<hi>hours</hi> for a day) his Master who
kill'd him, was <hi>not to die.</hi> So that,
though a Master had <hi>shed the blood</hi>
of his <hi>Man-servant</hi> or <hi>Maid-servant,</hi>
yet his blood (by this <hi>Law given</hi> to
<hi>Noah</hi>) could <hi>not be shed for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. Other Cases there <hi>may</hi> be,
<hi>and are,</hi> wherein a man may <hi>shed
man's blood,</hi> and yet his <hi>blood may not
be shed for it.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Numb 35. 30.</note> For instance,<note place="margin">Deut. 17. 6.</note> The
Law required two Witnesses to
put any <hi>Murderer to death;</hi> and
therefore if <hi>Sempronius</hi> had shed
<hi>Titius</hi> his blood, yet if there was
but <hi>one Witness legally to prove it,
Sempronius</hi> his <hi>blood could not be shed
by any man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the Premisses I think it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
that this Law given to
<hi>Noah,</hi> [He <hi>that sheds blood, by man
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64424:55"/>
shall his blood be shed</hi>] is not so <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
obligatory</hi> as some may
think it is. Seeing there may be
<hi>many persons</hi> and <hi>cases,</hi> wherein
<hi>man's blood may be shed,</hi> and yet he
<hi>who did it,</hi> cannot <hi>be put to death</hi> for
so doing. The Query then will
be, Whether the <hi>Supreme Power,</hi>
who (as to have his blood shed by
any man) is not <hi>under the Obligation
of this Law,</hi> may not (in <hi>some cases</hi>)
<hi>pardon a person condemn'd</hi> for Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?
For a distinct answer to this
Query it is to be considered;</p>
               <p>1. That it <hi>is certain,</hi> that this
<hi>Law given</hi> to <hi>Noah</hi> (nor any Law
<hi>de poenis</hi>) is not a <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Moral
Law;</hi> (all which Laws were <hi>ab
Origine,</hi> at the <hi>Creation,</hi> writ in the
<hi>Heart</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> and from <hi>him</hi> in the
<hi>Hearts</hi> of <hi>all his Posterity,</hi> and their
<hi>Obligation eternal</hi> and <hi>indispensable</hi>).
But it was a <hi>positive Law</hi> given to
<hi>Noah</hi> 1658. years <hi>after the Creation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:64424:56"/>
2. It is certain, That all such
<hi>Positive and Penal Laws,</hi> are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of <hi>Dispensations;</hi> and many
<hi>Cases may happen,</hi> in <hi>some times</hi> and
<hi>circumstances,</hi> (of which the <hi>Supreme
Power</hi> is the <hi>only,</hi> or (at least) the
<hi>Supreme Judge</hi>) wherein the <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi>
of such Laws <hi>ceaseth;</hi> so that
no <hi>man is bound</hi> to <hi>execute or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi>
the <hi>Punishments appointed</hi> by those
Laws. That this may evidently
appear I shall give some few In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances:</p>
               <p>1. It was a <hi>Divine Positive Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 17. 14.</note>
                  <hi>that all the seed of Abraham should be
Circumcised the eighth day on pain of
being cut off from his People:</hi> And
yet the <hi>Obligation</hi> of that <hi>Divine
Positive Law ceased,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Josh. 5. 5, 7.</note> for <hi>forty years,</hi>
while they <hi>wander'd in the Wilderness;</hi>
and yet <hi>Moses,</hi> their <hi>Supreme Power,</hi>
did neither Punish (according to
the <hi>Letter of the Law</hi>) nor <hi>blame them</hi>
for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:64424:56"/>
2. It was a Divine <hi>Positive Law,</hi>
that they should keep <hi>the Passover</hi>
on the Fourteenth day of the <hi>first
Moneth;</hi> and yet there were seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Cases,<note place="margin">Exod. 12. 6.</note> wherein the Obligation
<hi>of that Law ceased,</hi> so that they did
not sin, though they did not <hi>that
day</hi> eat the Passover: For if any
one was casually <hi>unclean</hi> by <hi>touching
a dead body,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 9: 6, 10:</note> or if he were <hi>on a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
&amp;c. the Obligation of that Law
ceased, (as to him) and he <hi>sin'd</hi> not
though he did not <hi>eat the Passover,
on the day appointed by the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The <hi>Sanctification</hi> of the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
(as to that <hi>particular</hi> day) was
injoyn'd by a <hi>Divine Positive Law;</hi>
and (by that Law) it <hi>was capital</hi> to
<hi>violate the Sabbath,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 31. 14, 15.</note> or do any of
our <hi>own Work;</hi> the <hi>Worship of God
Almighty</hi> being the <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>only</hi>
work of <hi>that</hi> day: And yet it is
<hi>certain</hi> (and on all sides <hi>confess'd</hi>)
that in <hi>many Cases</hi> the <hi>Obligation</hi> of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64424:57"/>
                  <hi>that Law ceaseth,</hi> so that we may
lawfully do that which otherwise
to the <hi>Jews</hi> was <hi>Capital.</hi> If an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<hi>invade our Country,</hi> or a <hi>City be
set on fire</hi> on the Sabbath, or our
<hi>Lord's day,</hi> we may lawfully take
<hi>Arms to defend our Country;</hi> and (the
Church and Divine Service left)
make haste and <hi>labour hard to quench
the fire,</hi> and <hi>save the City.</hi> Now
as to the aforementioned <hi>Divine
Positive Laws,</hi> there may be <hi>many
Cases,</hi> wherein their <hi>Obligation cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
so that the <hi>Punishment other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
required by those Laws may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
be pardoned.</hi> So in this <hi>Law</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<hi>to Noah</hi> there <hi>have been,</hi> and may
<hi>be several Cases,</hi> wherein <hi>that Law
does not bind ad Poenam,</hi> and so the
Murderer may <hi>lawfully be pardon'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. And it is further to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
that <hi>this Law (de Homicidio)</hi>
given to <hi>Noah,</hi> does neither <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly
say,</hi> nor <hi>by any good consequence
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64424:57"/>
intimate,</hi> that the <hi>Supreme Power</hi>
shall not (in any Case) pardon a
condemn'd Murderer: It <hi>only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
death</hi> to be the <hi>just reward and
punishment of Murder;</hi> but it does
<hi>not say,</hi> that it must <hi>necessarily be
always executed;</hi> so that no <hi>Pardon,
in no case is to be admitted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. And it is <hi>certain,</hi> (and in our
present <hi>case</hi> more considerable)
That <hi>Jacobs two Sons, Simeon and Levi,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 34. 25.</note>
were guilty of <hi>Murder,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 49. 6.</note> and yet
were <hi>pardon'd,</hi> notwithstanding the
Law given to <hi>Noah:</hi> Sure it is,
that they were neither <hi>sentenc'd</hi> nor
put to death for their Murders;
but <hi>long after went</hi> down into <hi>Egypt</hi>
with <hi>Jacob</hi> their Father, and <hi>died
there.</hi> Though <hi>they had impiously</hi> and
abundantly shed <hi>Man</hi>'s blood, yet
<hi>their blood was not shed for it.</hi> Tho
<hi>Jacob</hi> their Father, and <hi>Isaac</hi> (who
was <hi>then living</hi>) were the <hi>Supreme
Powers</hi> in the then <hi>Church of God,</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:64424:58"/>
(consisting in the <hi>seed of Abraham</hi>)
and <hi>had power</hi> to do it. Nor could
those Patriarchs (<hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi>)
be <hi>ignorant</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> given to
<hi>Noah,</hi> seeing <hi>Noah himself</hi> lived
till the fifty seventh year of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and died only forty three
years before <hi>Isaac</hi>'s birth. Now,
considering the persons of these
<hi>two great Patriarchs,</hi> that they
were <hi>Prophets,</hi> men of <hi>exceeding
Piety,</hi> and <hi>beloved of God;</hi> we <hi>may
be sure they would</hi> not have trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed
that Law <hi>given by God to
Noah,</hi> if they had <hi>believed that the
Obligation of it was such</hi> as excluded
<hi>all possibility</hi> of <hi>Pardon.</hi> In short,
if those pious Patriarchs might
pardon Murder, then, I desire to
know why <hi>Supreme Princes (in some
cases)</hi> may not pardon it now?</p>
               <p>5. Lastly I ask, Did that <hi>Law
given to Noah,</hi> bind <hi>David</hi> and the
<hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>his time,</hi> or <hi>did it not?</hi> If
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64424:58"/>
                  <hi>not,</hi> how <hi>comes</hi> it to <hi>bind us</hi> now,
above 2700 years after <hi>David</hi>'s
death? If it did bind <hi>David</hi> then;
so as no pardon was to be <hi>permitted,</hi>
or <hi>granted</hi> to a <hi>Murderer,</hi> it is not
probable that <hi>David</hi> (a Prophet
and the best of Kings) would have
<hi>transgress'd</hi> that <hi>Divine Law,</hi> and
<hi>pardon'd Absolom.</hi> Especially if we
consider, that his other <hi>known</hi> sins
(as <hi>Murder, Adultery, Numbring the
People,</hi> &amp;c.) are <hi>confess'd by him;</hi>
and <hi>in Scripture mentioned as his sins;</hi>
but his pardoning <hi>Absolom,</hi> is no
where <hi>in Scripture confess'd</hi> by him,
or laid to his <hi>charge,</hi> as a transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of <hi>any Law. Sed manum de Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bula.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I desire you to ask <hi>those,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Query.</note> who
<hi>made the former Objection</hi> against the
King's <hi>power of pardoning Murder</hi>
from the Law <hi>given to Noah,</hi> and
think the <hi>Laws given to Noah still
Obligatory;</hi> How it comes to pass
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64424:59"/>
that in the same place,<note place="margin">Gen. 9. 4.</note> the <hi>first
Law</hi> given to <hi>Noah,</hi> is a <hi>Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to eat any Blood</hi> (which is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by Moses,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Levit. 17. 10.</note> and no <hi>where ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated;</hi>)
And yet all <hi>Papists and
Protestants</hi> eat Blood, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that Law of <hi>God to Noah
forbidding it.</hi> I desire to know of
the <hi>Gentleman</hi> (who made the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi>
which I hope I have <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
answer'd</hi>) why <hi>the second Law</hi>
given to <hi>Noah</hi> (<hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 6.) about
<hi>Murder,</hi> should be <hi>binding,</hi> and yet
the <hi>first Law</hi> (<hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 4.) against
<hi>eating Blood,</hi> should not be bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too. He who can and will

a kindness, which (if any) few

               <p>ALthough I well know, your
Loyalty to be as much, and
your Learning and Knowledg of
the Laws, and their Obligation,
to be more than mine; yet (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your command and my
promise) I have here sent you, a
Compendium and short Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
of some Discourses I
lately had with some, who seem'd
to doubt, <hi>Whether our Gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
could reprive or pardon a person
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64424:61"/>
legally condemned for Murder?</hi> For a
distinct answer to this Query, I
consider,</p>
               <p>1. That it is <hi>certain,</hi> that all we
<hi>Subjects,</hi> are (by the <hi>indispensable
law of God</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi>) bound,<note place="margin">Prov. 24. 21.</note>
(<hi>next</hi> to our good God,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 17.</note> the great
King of Heaven and Earth) to
<hi>honour and obey our Gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign;</hi>
and that not only <hi>for fear</hi>
of punishment,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 5.</note> but <hi>for Conscience
lake.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 2.</note> So that to <hi>do,</hi> or <hi>speak,</hi> or <hi>think
dishonourably</hi> of the Lord Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<note place="margin">Act. 23. 5.</note>
                  <hi>our King,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 22. 28.</note> and to <hi>question</hi> and
<hi>deny</hi> any of the <hi>Rights of his Crown</hi>
and <hi>Prerogatives,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccles 10. 20.</note> is in all <hi>Subjects
disloyal</hi> and <hi>impious.</hi> In the <hi>Natural
Body,</hi> if there be any <hi>blemish</hi> or <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease</hi>
in the <hi>head,</hi> if it be in <hi>any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
from without, <hi>all the members</hi>
of the body (the <hi>dictates of Right
Reason,</hi> and the <hi>principles of Nature</hi>
requiring it) will industriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
<hi>to cover and conceal that blemish,</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:64424:61"/>
to <hi>cure</hi> that <hi>disease,</hi> and prevent <hi>all
danger</hi> that may <hi>happen to the Head.</hi>
So in the Body Politick, if the <hi>King</hi>
(the <hi>Head of that Body</hi>) have any
<hi>errors or failings,</hi> as (our Blessed
Saviour only excepted) <hi>the best men
in the world ever bad;</hi> then all the
<hi>members</hi> of that Body (as by the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable
Law</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> they <hi>are
bound</hi>) ought <hi>to conceal</hi> the <hi>frailties</hi>
of <hi>their Prince,</hi> and not to <hi>censure</hi>
or <hi>publish them</hi> to <hi>his dishonour,</hi> either
<hi>by word or writing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. But notwithstanding this, it
is too <hi>certain,</hi> that in <hi>this Nation,</hi>
in the late <hi>unhappy times</hi> of <hi>confusion,</hi>
and most <hi>horrid Rebellion,</hi> we have
had a multitude <hi>and rable of seditious</hi>
people, (who <hi>miscall'd themselves
the Goldy party</hi>) who have been so
<hi>far from duly honouring</hi> their <hi>Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Soveraign,</hi> maintaining the
<hi>known</hi> Rights of his <hi>Crown,</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving</hi>
his <hi>Sacred person</hi> from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64424:62"/>
that they have (without all
<hi>ground</hi>) <hi>falsly slandered,</hi> and in the
<hi>Press and Pulpit,</hi> by <hi>Lyes and Libels,</hi>
indeavour'd <hi>to ruin his honour</hi> and
<hi>reputation.</hi> Nor stay'd they here,
but <hi>having got power</hi> to compleat
<hi>the Tragedy,</hi> they did, what before
they desired, seise the <hi>Kings Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue,</hi>
and all the <hi>Rights of the
Crown</hi> into <hi>their own bands,</hi> and at
last, with a <hi>prodigious, and more</hi> than
<hi>Pagan impiety,</hi> (<hi>horresco referens</hi>)
they <hi>murdered</hi> their <hi>innocent and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Prince.</hi> An <hi>act so villanous,</hi> and
so far beyond all <hi>expression barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous;</hi>
that since our Blessed <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
death,</hi> no Age or Nation <hi>ever
had,</hi> or (I hope) <hi>ever will have,</hi> any
<hi>Villany equal to it,</hi> and (all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
considered) of <hi>parallel im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety.</hi>
And since his Majesties hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
and <hi>Miraculous Restauration</hi> to his
<hi>Fathers Throne in peace,</hi> it is <hi>too
evident</hi> by the <hi>impious Plots</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64424:62"/>
happily discovered,</hi> and their
disloyal and <hi>Trayterous designs dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed,</hi>
some still remain, who
<hi>if they had</hi> (What I <hi>hope they never
will</hi>) <hi>ability,</hi> want not <hi>a mind to do
mischief,</hi> who have talk'd so long
<hi>of that liberty and property of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi>
that to maintain <hi>the just Rights</hi>
and <hi>Prerogative</hi> of <hi>their Prince,</hi>
(which in the <hi>first place ought</hi> to
have been consider'd and <hi>preserved</hi>)
is no <hi>part of their care</hi> and <hi>desire,</hi>
but rather <hi>the diminution of it,</hi> and
(had they <hi>ability and opportunity</hi>) the
<hi>utter abrogation</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>The Premisses consider'd, I think
that <hi>every loyal subject,</hi> as he is (by
<hi>natural or sworn Allegiance,</hi> or <hi>both</hi>)
at <hi>all times,</hi> so <hi>especially in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances</hi>
we now are, <hi>is obliged</hi>
with <hi>more care</hi> and diligence, to
<hi>maintain and vindicate</hi> his <hi>Soveraigns
just Rights and Prerogatives.</hi> For
where and when there is greater
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64424:63"/>
and <hi>more eminent danger,</hi> there ought
to be <hi>greater care and diligence to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it.</hi> These Considerations,
and some addresses of some ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Cavaliers, who <hi>believed, that
the King</hi> had <hi>power,</hi> by <hi>his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Royal, to pardon</hi> in the Cafe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
but could <hi>more easily believe
the truth,</hi> than <hi>answer Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it,</hi> and therefore desired my
assistance to help them to answer
the <hi>principal</hi> (and indeed the only
pretended) <hi>Objection,</hi> which seem'd
(and <hi>only seem'd</hi>) to prove, that
his Sacred Majesty <hi>could not pardon</hi>
a person <hi>legally condemn'd</hi> for <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
I say, that these reasons induced
me more seriously to consider
the Case proposed, and after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
consideration of all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
being <hi>in my own judgment
convinc'd,</hi> and having <hi>satisfi'd my
doubting friends,</hi> That his Majesty
<hi>might lawfully pardon such a condemn'd
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64424:63"/>
Malefactor,</hi> I shall now (in short)
give you an account of those Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
which satisfy'd me and them,
and refer them to your <hi>better Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
And here, that I may set
down what I have to say, with
more method and perspicuity: I
shall, 1. Suppose two or three
things, which (to me) <hi>seem evident
Truths,</hi> and will conduce to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
his <hi>Majesties power to pardon,</hi> and
then I shall proceed. I suppose
then,</p>
               <p>1. That the <hi>Kingdom of England
is a Monarchy.</hi> That is, (as the
<hi>word signifies</hi>) a Government,
wherein the <hi>Supreme power is in one
single person.</hi> This our <hi>Statutes</hi> say,<note place="margin">Stat. 1 Eliz. cap. 1.</note>
and (in our <hi>Oath of Supremacy</hi>) we
swear, <hi>That the King is the</hi> ONLY
SUPREME, <hi>Governour of this
Realm. 1. Supreme,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
none <hi>above him.</hi> 2. ONLY
Supreme, and therefore <hi>none coor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64424:64"/>
with him, or equal to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That <hi>England</hi> is an <hi>Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Monarchy.</hi> We say, <hi>the King ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
dies.</hi> The <hi>man</hi> who was King
<hi>may die,</hi> and cease to be, but the
<hi>King and Royal Power ceases not,</hi> but
<hi>immediately descends to,</hi> and <hi>is seated</hi>
in his <hi>next Heir</hi> and Successor. In
the <hi>next minute</hi> after any King's
death, the next <hi>Heir to the Crown,
is actually King,</hi> as well and as
<hi>much before,</hi> as <hi>after his Coronation.</hi>
As <hi>in Matrimony,</hi> it is not <hi>the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization</hi>
of it, in <hi>the Church,</hi> nor the
<hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Benediction of the Priest,</hi>
that makes <hi>Husband and Wife.</hi> For
it is (by Law and Reason) certain,
that <hi>consensus facit Matrimonium:
Solemnization</hi> of it in the <hi>Church,</hi> is
only a <hi>publick Declaration</hi> of the
<hi>antecedent consent,</hi> which made the
<hi>parties man and wife</hi> coram Deo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they <hi>came to the Church.</hi> So is
<hi>Coronation to a King,</hi> it does <hi>not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:64424:64"/>
and make him so, but <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose
and declare publickly,</hi> that <hi>this
person</hi> is indeed <hi>our Prince.</hi> Neither
has the <hi>Pope or people,</hi> any thing to
do by way of <hi>Election or approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Successor</hi> to the Crown. And
so in our <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> we
<hi>swear fidelity</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Statut. 3. Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobi, cap. 4.</note> His
HEIRS and SUCCESSORS.
The <hi>same</hi> Oath of <hi>Allegiance</hi> we
<hi>took to Charles the Martyr,</hi> in the <hi>next
minute after his death,</hi> as equally
<hi>and indispensably bound us,</hi> to be loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
and <hi>faithful to his Son</hi> and Heir
<hi>Charles the Second,</hi> our now Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
King.</p>
               <p>3. The <hi>Kingdom of England</hi> is
not only <hi>a Monarchy,</hi> but an AB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOLUTE
<hi>Monarchy.</hi> So my Lord
<hi>Cook</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">My Lord Cook's Repor. Part. 5. <hi>de ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Regis Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siast.</hi> pag. 40. Edit. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1612.</note> in these signal words,
<hi>Thus it hath appeared, as well by the
ancient</hi> COMMON LAWS, <hi>as by
the Judgment and</hi> RESOLUTION
<hi>of the</hi> JUDGES <hi>of the Laws of</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64424:65"/>
                  <hi>in All</hi> AGES, <hi>and by the
Authority of</hi> MANY ACTS <hi>of
Parliament, that the Kingdom of</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
<hi>is an</hi> ABSOLUTE <hi>Monarchy;
and that the King is the Supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,</hi>
&amp;c. And Sir <hi>John Davis,</hi>
(that I may not trouble you with
any more Quotations) says the
very same thing,<note n="*" place="margin">Sir <hi>John Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis</hi> his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, in the Case of Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire, (which is his last Case) pag. 85.</note> 
                  <hi>The King of</hi>
England <hi>are</hi> ABSOLUTE EM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PERORS
<hi>in their Dominions,</hi> &amp;c.
And again,<note n="†" place="margin">Idem ibid. pag. 89. col. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>The King of</hi> England
<hi>has the same</hi> ABSOLUTE <hi>Liberties in
his Dominions, as the Emperor in his
Empire.</hi> The <hi>meaning is not,</hi> that our
Kings <hi>are so absolute</hi> as to <hi>be freed
from obedience of the Laws of God,</hi>
(<hi>natural or positive</hi> in the Gospel)
but because there is <hi>no power on
earth,</hi> (<hi>except their own</hi>) which <hi>can
lay any obligation</hi> or <hi>limitation upon
them.</hi> And this is evident, because
our Kings <hi>being supreme, having none
superior or equal to them,</hi> it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64424:65"/>
                  <hi>that any power on earth,</hi> (for it
is most certain that <hi>no inferior power
can do it</hi>) should be able <hi>to oblige or
limit them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it may be said,<note place="margin">Object.</note> If our <hi>Kings
be absolute,</hi> so as no power on earth
can oblige or limit them, <hi>then they
may by themselves</hi> make <hi>and abrogate
Laws, lay Taxes on the people,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This does not follow;<note place="margin">Sol.</note> for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<hi>no power on earth</hi> is <hi>superior to
them,</hi> or <hi>can oblige or limit them,</hi> yet
they <hi>may limit themselves,</hi> by <hi>Oath or
promise;</hi> and so our Kings have <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
their power,</hi> and <hi>promised</hi> and
(in their <hi>Coronation-Oath</hi>) <hi>sworn to
do none of those</hi> things <hi>without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of their people in Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But does not <hi>this limiting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Object.</note>
take away and <hi>destroy their
Absoluteness?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No; if any <hi>other power could lay
Obligations</hi> and <hi>Limitations upon them,</hi>
then (I grant) <hi>they were not absolute,</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:64424:66"/>
but <hi>to limit themselves,</hi> is <hi>consistent
with absolute power.</hi> For the truth
of this, we have an evident and <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
instance.</hi> It is most certain,
that <hi>God Almighty is an absolute King</hi>
of all the world; yet, (for the
<hi>comfort of his people</hi>) he has <hi>limited
himself</hi> by <hi>Oath and promise,</hi> (so the
Apostle tells us) <hi>That by two immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
things,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 17, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>in which it is impossible
for God to lye, we might have strong
consolation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These things premised, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the great power of our Kings,
That it is <hi>Monarchical, Supreme</hi> and
<hi>Absolute,</hi> the Query is, <hi>Whether they
can</hi> and lawfully <hi>may,</hi> either
<list>
                     <item>1. Reprive</item>
                     <item>2. Or pardon</item>
                  </list>a person <hi>condemn'd for
Murder?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is a <hi>certain Rule,(in Law
and Reason)</hi> that <hi>Omne illicitum est
ex lege aliqua illicitum. Sin is the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
of a Law;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh 3. 4</note> and, <hi>where there
is no law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>there is no transgression.</hi> If
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64424:66"/>
then <hi>such Reprive or Pardon be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi>
and may not be granted by
the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> then it must
be so, <hi>by some law,</hi> which <hi>prohibits
it, and that must be either,</hi> 
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Some Humane, <hi>or</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. Some Divine,</item>
                  </list>Law.</p>
               <p>For <hi>the first,</hi> unless it do appear,
that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
to <hi>reprive</hi> or <hi>pardon</hi> such
<hi>malefactors,</hi> by <hi>some law of our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
to the making where of<hi>they have
given their consent,</hi> and so <hi>limited their
own power:</hi> I say unless there be <hi>such
a law,</hi> it will be evident, that it <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be unlawful</hi> (by any<hi>humane law</hi>)
for our Kings to <hi>reprive</hi> or <hi>pardon</hi>
such <hi>malefactors.</hi> But although I
have reason to believe, that <hi>there
is no such law;</hi> Yet whether there
be any such Law or no, I <hi>shall not
determine;</hi> but leave <hi>it to the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Judges,</hi> and the <hi>learned in our
laws,</hi> who are <hi>best able</hi> to determine
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64424:67"/>
that Question. It belongs not to
my calling, or present business to
determine the Case, <hi>by humane
laws.</hi> That which was desired of
me was this, <hi>Whether the Reprive</hi> or
<hi>Pardon</hi> of a <hi>person legally condemn'd</hi>
for Murder, <hi>were prohibited,</hi> and so
<hi>unlawful by the law of God;</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
by that Law given to the
<hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>Moses,</hi> in these words, <hi>Thou
shalt take</hi> NO SATISFACTION <hi>for
the life of a murderer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 35. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>who is guilty of
death, he shall</hi> SURELY BE PUT
TO DEATH. NOW to determine
<hi>this case of Conscience,</hi> by the <hi>Divine
Law,</hi> is within the compass of <hi>my
Calling;</hi> and by this time (at the
Age of 77.) I am, or <hi>ought to be,
in some measure,</hi> a competent Judge
of such Cases. And therefore, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing is <hi>required of me,</hi> save
(what <hi>is in my power to give</hi>) my <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
in the Case; I shall here,</p>
               <p>1. Humbly and with submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64424:67"/>
to my Superiors, give my <hi>opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and judgment in the Case.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Reasons for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. For the first, my present
opinion and judgment is, That
there is <hi>no Divine Law</hi> which <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits,</hi>
and so makes <hi>it unlawful</hi> for
<hi>Supreme Princes,</hi> to <hi>Reprive</hi> or <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
a person legally condemned <hi>for
murder.</hi> And this I shall endeavour
<hi>distinctly to shew</hi> and prove,
<list>
                     <item>1. That a <hi>Reprive</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. That a Pardon</item>
                  </list>is not by any
Law of God
unlawful.</p>
               <p>1. For the first, <hi>To Reprive,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Repriving</note> is
not to <hi>null or make void the Sentence</hi>
pass'd upon a <hi>murderer,</hi> or <hi>to free
him from it;</hi> but <hi>only (for some time)</hi>
the <hi>delaying</hi> the <hi>execution</hi> of it. Now
'tis certain, that there is no <hi>Law
of God</hi> which <hi>prohibits such Reprive,</hi>
and <hi>delay of executing the sentence,</hi>
or any way make it <hi>unlawful</hi> for
the <hi>Supreme power to grant such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive.</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:64424:68"/>
The <hi>severest Law</hi> against
Murderers, is that in the Book of
<hi>Numbers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 35. 31.</note>(but now nam'd) which
says; <hi>That no satisfaction shall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for the life of a Murderer, but he
shall surely be put to death.</hi> But <hi>that
Law does not say,</hi> that he <hi>must die
the same day the sentence</hi> pass'd, <hi>or the
same week or month.</hi> If a Murderer
be <hi>executed a month after the sentence</hi>
passed, <hi>he dies</hi> As SURELY, as
if he had died the same day.
2. There may be just reasons
drawn from the Law of <hi>Nature</hi>
and <hi>Scripture,</hi> why (in many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses)
the <hi>supreme Magistrate</hi> not only
<hi>lawfully may,</hi> but <hi>ought to grant</hi> such
<hi>a Reprive.</hi> The Law of God and
Nature, <hi>does indispensably bind all,
to love their neighbour as their selves;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 39.</note>
and therefore (so far <hi>as we have abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>)
to <hi>endeavour his Salvation.</hi> Now
a <hi>condemn'd murderer</hi> (who <hi>has no
pardon</hi>) is sure to lose a <hi>temporal</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:64424:68"/>
life, and that he may not lose
eternal life too, (it is the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and <hi>judgment</hi> of the best
<hi>Scholar</hi> and <hi>Lawyer</hi> in his time) <hi>it
will</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ne cum vita, spatium ad pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitendum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludatur, sciant hujus rei, à piis magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus, summam haberi ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, nec quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ad sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicium <hi>RAPI, NISI DATO TEMPORE,</hi> quo peccata sua agnoscere, &amp; serio dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stari possit. <hi>Grotius de Jure Belli, lib. 2. cap.</hi> 20. De Poenis. <hi>Sect.</hi> 12.</note> 
                  <hi>and should be the care of pious
Princes, not to hurry such condemn'd
malefactors hastily to death, but to
grant them some time, (by a Reprive)
before they leave this, to consult their
Ghostly Father, and (by prayer, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
their sins, true penitence,</hi> and
the <hi>comfort of Absolution</hi>) prepare
<hi>themselves for a better life.</hi> 3. But
although this be a certain truth,
That the Supreme power may <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
a condemn'd Murderer,</hi> yet it
will further appear, (and beyond
all contradiction) in the proof of
the next particular: Where it will
appear, That the King (by his
<hi>Supreme power, and Royal Prerogative</hi>)
may lawfully <hi>pardon</hi> such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
malefactor, and therefore
much more may he lawfully <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:64424:69"/>
him. For he who can law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<hi>pardon and remit the punishment</hi>
of Death, that it shall <hi>never</hi> be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
may certainly for some
<hi>small time,</hi> (for <hi>a week, a month, or
two</hi>) suspend <hi>and delay the execution
of it.</hi> And so I proceed to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
particular.</p>
               <p>2. It is <hi>not unlawful by any Divine
Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Pardoning.</note> for the <hi>Supreme Power,</hi> to
<hi>pardon a person convict and condemned
for Murder.</hi> The reason is evident,
because there is <hi>no Divine Law,
which prohibits</hi> the Supreme <hi>power to
grant such a Pardon.</hi> That this may
more distinctly appear, it is <hi>certain
and confess'd,</hi> that <hi>Divine Laws</hi> are
either,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Evangelical,</hi> made known to
us in the Gospel.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Mosaical,</hi> such as God by
<hi>Moses</hi> made known to his own
people the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. For the first, The <hi>Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64424:69"/>
Laws</hi> were <hi>given by our</hi> Blessed
Saviour in the Gospel, for the <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
and perpetual Government of his
Church.</hi> Now it is certain, that <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
these Laws there is nothing of
any temporal punishment.</hi> Our Blessed
Saviour tells <hi>Pilate,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 18. 36.</note> That <hi>his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
was not of this world;</hi> (it was <hi>no
Temporal Kingdom</hi>) It was not to
be <hi>promoted by the sword,</hi> or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
punishments. He left his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
no power to punish</hi> the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
of his Laws, either, 1. In
<hi>their Purse,</hi> (by <hi>Pecuniary Mulcts</hi> or
<hi>Fines.</hi>) Nor, 2. in<hi>their Persons</hi> (by
<hi>Death or Imprisonments.</hi>) All such <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
does,</hi> and <hi>ever did</hi> belong to the
<hi>Civil Magistrate,</hi> who <hi>only</hi> has <hi>Jus
Gladii.</hi> Nor is <hi>there any Law in the
Gospel,</hi> which so much <hi>as mentions,</hi>
much <hi>less prohibits the Civil</hi> Supreme
Magistrate, <hi>to pardon condemn'd
Malefactors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. For the <hi>Mosaical Laws,</hi> (<hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64424:70"/>
and Judicial</hi>) they were such,
as were <hi>given by God himself,</hi> for the
good <hi>Government of the Jewish Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</hi>
Now concerning these
Laws, <hi>it is certain,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. That they were <hi>given</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 147. 19. 20. Rom. 9. 4. Eph. 2. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>only
to the Jews,</hi> as is confess'd and <hi>fully</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Suarez de Legibus, lib. 9. cap. 5. Sect. 7. p. 738. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin. 1. 2. Quest. 98. Art. 4. Filliuc. Moral, Quest. Tom. 2. Trac. 21. cap. 11. Sect. 402.</note>
                  <hi>proved</hi> by the <hi>Schoolmen and
Casuists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It is certain, that <hi>no positive
Law (Divine</hi> or <hi>humane) does,</hi> or <hi>can
bind any save those</hi> to <hi>whom it is given,</hi>
and <hi>sufficiently promulgated</hi> and <hi>made</hi>
known. A <hi>sufficient Promulgation
is absolutely necessary</hi> to the <hi>Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of any positive Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. And hence it follows, that
<hi>those Mosaical Laws never bound</hi> the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> before <hi>our blessed</hi> Saviour's
time, <hi>much less Christians</hi> since, (as
will anon appear.) And therefore
<hi>if that Law</hi> in <hi>Numb. 35.</hi> 31. (but
now mention'd) <hi>or any other Mosai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Law,</hi> had <hi>absolutely forbid,</hi> and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64424:70"/>
made the <hi>pardoning of Murder unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the Jews,</hi> yet it will not hence
follow, that it should be (<hi>by that
Law) unlawful for Gentiles or Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to pardon it,</hi> seeing it is manifest,
that <hi>those Mosaical Laws</hi> were <hi>never
given to,</hi> nor <hi>any way obliged them.</hi> For
the <hi>Transgression of any Law,</hi> does
necessarily <hi>presuppose its Obligation:</hi>
It being impossible I <hi>should trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
a Law, which never bound me to
Obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. The obligation of the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
Laws ceased,</hi> (even <hi>to the Jews,</hi>
to whom they were given) at the
<hi>death of our Blessed Saviour.</hi> They
were <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> of his
<hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>our Redemption</hi> by him;
and when <hi>the Substance,</hi> and <hi>thing
typified by them</hi> was <hi>come,</hi> the <hi>Shadows
ceased.</hi> Whence it is, that <hi>Divines</hi>
(both <hi>Ancient and Modern</hi>) truly say,
That at our Blessed <hi>Saviours Death,</hi>
the <hi>Jewish Ceremonial Law</hi> was <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:64424:71"/>
(as to <hi>its obligation;</hi>) it <hi>was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated,</hi>
and the <hi>observation of it not
necessary;</hi> tho <hi>for some time,</hi> to <hi>gain
the Jews,</hi> even the Apostles did
<hi>voluntarily observe it.</hi> But when the
Gospel was <hi>more fully published,</hi> it
became <hi>Mortifera,</hi> and the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of it <hi>inconsistent with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>5. For the <hi>Judicial Law of the
Jews,</hi> it is certain, <hi>that the Obligation
of it ceas'd</hi> (at least) at the destruction
of Jerusalem, when the <hi>Jewish Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
and their <hi>Commonwealth
was utterly destroy'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. And hence it evidently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<hi>that all</hi> those <hi>Mosaical Laws,</hi>
(Judicial and Ceremonial) have
been <hi>abrogated and null,</hi> and have
<hi>neither bound Jew or Gentile</hi> above
this 1600 years last past; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is impossible <hi>that any of
them</hi> should <hi>now bind any Christian</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Power <hi>not to pardon</hi> any <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
malefactor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:64424:71"/>
And what is said of the <hi>Judicial</hi>
and <hi>Ceremonial Laws,</hi> given to the
<hi>Jews by Moses;</hi> that none of them
<hi>ever did,</hi> or <hi>could bind</hi> any <hi>Gentiles
or Christians;</hi> the same we say, of
the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> (as to <hi>punishing or
pardoning Murderers</hi>) that it <hi>never
prohibited</hi> Supreme Princes to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
or pardon</hi> any person condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>for Murder.</hi> That this may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
it must be considered, that
there are <hi>two Editions</hi> of the <hi>Moral
Law; both writ</hi> by the Omnipotent
and Gracious Author of it, <hi>by God
himself,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. In the <hi>heart of Adam,</hi> where
it was <hi>most intirely</hi> and <hi>perfectly writ.</hi>
His <hi>Understanding</hi> being <hi>clear,</hi> and
<hi>abundantly able to know</hi> and <hi>distinguish
good from evil; quid faciendum, quid
fugiendum;</hi> and his will <hi>obsequious</hi>
to follow <hi>those dictates</hi> of <hi>right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
But by the fall of <hi>Adam, this
Writing</hi> and perfect Edition of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64424:72"/>
Moral Law, <hi>was much blotted, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted</hi>
and <hi>defac'd,</hi> both in <hi>Adam,</hi>
and <hi>all his Posterity.</hi> For although
<hi>the substance</hi> of <hi>that Law,</hi> did (<hi>after
the fall</hi>) <hi>continue writ in their nearts;
yet so defac'd</hi> by <hi>the Fall,</hi> that (igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
having <hi>blinded the Under stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>)
it was in <hi>many places, not le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,</hi>
nor (<hi>sin having corrupted the
will) practicable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The <hi>second Edition</hi> of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Law,</hi> (in respect of the writing
of it, which remain'd in the hearts
of men after the fall) was <hi>multo
auctior &amp; emendatior.</hi> And this <hi>Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Moral Law,</hi> is that, which
<hi>God, by Moses, gave only to his own
Church and People the Jews.</hi> In which
he gave them,</p>
               <p>1. A just and <hi>perfect Compendium</hi>
of that <hi>whole Law</hi> in two Tables of
Stone, containing <hi>Ten Precepts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. A full and <hi>more perfect expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
of those Precepts, and the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64424:72"/>
                  <hi>particular duties</hi> required by them.</p>
               <p>3. An <hi>addition</hi> of many <hi>Gracious
promises</hi> and blessings to those who
<hi>sincerely observ'd those Laws;</hi> and
many <hi>threats and punishments</hi> for
those who <hi>transgress'd any of those
Laws.</hi> This Edition of the <hi>Moral
Law,</hi> with the many <hi>promises and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
annext,</hi> was (as I said) given
<hi>only to the Jews, not to the Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this appears by that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
passage in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he tells the <hi>Romans</hi> in these
words, <hi>The Gentiles which</hi> HAVE
NOT THE LAW, <hi>do</hi> BY NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURE,<note place="margin">Rom.
2. 14</note> 
                  <hi>These</hi> HAVING NOT
THE LAW, <hi>are a law to themselves,
which shews the work of the Law</hi>
WRITTEN IN THEIR
HEARTS. In which words,
we have the <hi>two Editions of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Law,</hi> afore mentioned, expresly
set down, and that the Gentiles
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64424:73"/>
had <hi>only the first Edition;</hi> and that
the <hi>second and more</hi> perfect Edition,
was <hi>given only to the Jews.</hi> For the
Apostle says,</p>
               <p>1. That the Gentiles HAD
NOT THE LAW; to wit,
as it was <hi>Lex scripta in Lapide,</hi> and
given <hi>to the Jews,</hi> with the <hi>Addition</hi>
of many <hi>Promises,</hi> and many <hi>seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
punishments annext</hi> to the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions
of <hi>particular Precepts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That the <hi>Gentiles</hi> HAD
THE LAW <hi>writ</hi> IN CORDE,
for so <hi>all men by nature</hi> had it. And
'tis the <hi>Moral Law he means,</hi> for no
<hi>positive Law of God or man, is by
nature writ in any mans heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what is said in the <hi>second</hi>
and more <hi>perfect Edition</hi> of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Law,</hi> as it was given <hi>by Moses on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Jews,</hi> is either, 1. <hi>De Officiis.</hi>
2. Or <hi>de poenis &amp; promissis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. <hi>De Officiis; quid faciendum aut
fugiendum:</hi> What good we are to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64424:73"/>
do in obedience to the <hi>Affirmative
Precepts.</hi> As in that, <hi>Remember the
Sabbath-day to keep it holy: Honour
thy Father and Mother, &amp;c.</hi> And
what evil we are to avoid in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the Negative Precepts;
such as these, <hi>Thou shalt not kill, Thou
shalt not commit Adultery, &amp;c.</hi> In
short, the sum of all those Duties
which the <hi>Moral Law requires of us,</hi>
is this, <hi>That we love God with all our
heart, and our neighbour as our selves.</hi>
Now as to <hi>all these duties,</hi> the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> is <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal,
Eternal,</hi> and <hi>Indispensable.</hi> It
<hi>binds all men, Jews and Gentiles,</hi> and
<hi>that indispensably.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>De promissis &amp; poenis,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the <hi>Promises</hi> and <hi>punishments</hi>
which are <hi>annext</hi> to the <hi>Moral Law,</hi>
as it was <hi>given to the Jews</hi> by <hi>Moses.</hi>
And here,</p>
               <p>I. For the Promises, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that they were given <hi>only to the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64424:74"/>
Jews.</hi> For the Apostle expresly tells
us, <hi>That the Gentiles were aliens and
strangers to the promises.</hi> For instance,
<hi>the promise added</hi> to the <hi>fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph.
2. 12. &amp; Eph. 3. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Honour thy Father and thy
Mother, that thy days may be long in
the land which the Lord thy God</hi> GI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VETH
THEE. <hi>Canaan</hi> is the
Land <hi>promised</hi> and <hi>given</hi> to the <hi>Jews</hi>
only, not to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> nor ever
<hi>intended for them;</hi> it being indeed
impossible, <hi>that all Jews and Gentiles</hi>
should live in that little Land. But
to pass by the promises, (which
do not so properly belong to our
present business) I say,</p>
               <p>2. That it is <hi>as certain,</hi> that <hi>all
the Mosaical Laws de Poenis,</hi> are (not
<hi>natural,</hi> but) <hi>Positive and Judicial
Laws,</hi> which <hi>never bound any save

                  <hi>Jews,</hi> (or those who became
<hi>Proselytes,</hi> and <hi>voluntarily submitted</hi>
to them) to whom <hi>only</hi> they <hi>were
given.</hi> That this may further and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64424:74"/>
more <hi>distinctly appear,</hi> it is to be
confidered as <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>consessed,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. That the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> (as
all <hi>just</hi> Laws do) <hi>binds all men;</hi> 1. <hi>Ad

Obedience.</hi> And, 2. (upon supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

to which the <hi>Law of Nature</hi>
binds, is <hi>Death;</hi> and that <hi>Eternal
Death.</hi> For as <hi>in Adam</hi> (by reason of

                  <note place="margin">1

death. Every sin</hi> (how <hi>small soever</hi>)
by <hi>the Covenant of Works,</hi> (of which
the Moral Law was the <hi>condition</hi>

a <hi>capital crime,</hi>

which <hi>neither do,</hi> nor <hi>ever did</hi> bind
any but the <hi>Jews.</hi> As may appear,</p>
               <p>2. Because they were <hi>given only
to the</hi> Jews; and that after they
<hi>came out of Egypt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 29. 1.</note> which was after

(of which we speak) were
<hi>never given,</hi> nor <hi>publish'd</hi> to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>
But had those Laws <hi>de Poenis,</hi>
been <hi>Natural Laws,</hi> (as the Precepts

have <hi>bound all mankind</hi> from the
<hi>Creation to this day,</hi> and that <hi>indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensably;</hi>
and then all Christians
should be bound to <hi>obey</hi> and <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
those Penal laws,</hi> and <hi>punish</hi> all

               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:64424:75"/>
3. By the judgment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the <hi>Christian World;</hi> for <hi>no
Christian Church or State</hi> did ever
<hi>think themselves bound</hi> to <hi>observe</hi> those
<hi>Mosaical Poenal Laws,</hi> and to <hi>punish</hi>
transgressors of the Divine Law,
<hi>with those punishments</hi> which <hi>are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by Moses.</hi> For instance, <hi>That

with <hi>restitutio in quadruplum,</hi>
with <hi>restoring four sheep</hi> for one,<note place="margin">Exod. 22. 1.</note> (if

he stole); but if the sheep <hi>was

<hi>the stealer of an Ox</hi> should restore

That <hi>to do any of our own work</hi> (so

on the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 31. 15.</note> should be <hi>capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi>

                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:64424:76"/>
                  <hi>these things, surely put to death;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
these, and such other Laws
<hi>de Poenis,</hi> were <hi>Divine, given to the</hi>
Jews <hi>by</hi> Moses, and <hi>obliged them;</hi>
yet <hi>no Christian Church or State,</hi> did
ever <hi>think themselves obliged</hi> to the
<hi>observation</hi> and <hi>practice of them.</hi> And
they had <hi>good ground</hi> in the <hi>Gospels</hi>
to <hi>think so.</hi> For,</p>
               <p>4. Our Blessed Saviour in his
Sermon on the Mount,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 6, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>explains
and confirms all the Moral</hi> Laws <hi>de
Officiis,</hi> yet those <hi>severe Mosaical
Laws de Poenis,</hi> he did <hi>not confirm:</hi>
But <hi>expresly declares,</hi> that <hi>legal se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
to be inconsistent with the Charity
of the Gospel.</hi> For though by the
<hi>Mosaical law,</hi> a Jew <hi>might justly</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,<note place="margin">Exod. 21. 24.</note> and the <hi>Judge give an eye for
an eye,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 19. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>and a tooth for a tooth;</hi> yet
our Blessed Saviour expresly <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
against such legal severity. You
have heard</hi> (saith he) <hi>it has been said,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 38.</note>
(in the Law of Moses) <hi>an eye for an
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64424:76"/>
eye, and a tooth for a tooth:</hi> But I say
unto you, <hi>Resist not evil, &amp;c, He
does not allow that severity in poenis,</hi> in
the <hi>Gospel, which</hi> Moses <hi>allow'd the</hi>
Jews <hi>under the Law;</hi> and therefore
we <hi>may be sure,</hi> that it was not any
<hi>Moral</hi> or <hi>Natural Law</hi> which <hi>requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi>
those <hi>punishments appointed</hi> for
several sins in the <hi>Law of Moses,</hi>
(for then they had <hi>been unalterable,</hi>
nor would our <hi>Blessed Saviour have
contradicted them</hi>); but it was the
<hi>positive law of Moses</hi> which <hi>required</hi>
them of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to <hi>whom only
these Laws were given,</hi> and <hi>obligatory.</hi>
And here (for further evidence of
this truth) it is to be considered,</p>
               <p>1. That in that <hi>Mosaical Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 35. 31.</note>
(which is ignorantly or maliciously
urged to prove that our Gracious
Soveraign cannot <hi>pardon murder</hi>) the
<hi>strictest binding words</hi> are these, <hi>The
Murderer</hi> SHALL SURELY BE
PUT TO DEATH. Therefore,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64424:77"/>
(say they) he <hi>cannot</hi> be <hi>pardon'd.</hi>
They who reason thus, did not
well consider the consequence of
such arguing <hi>from the Penal Laws
in Moses.</hi> For if this <hi>argument be
good, Moses</hi> says, <hi>The Murderer shall
surely be put to death:</hi> Ergo, <hi>He
cannot be pardon'd:</hi> Then this (<hi>groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi>
on the <hi>same law of Moses</hi>) will
be every way as <hi>good</hi> and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.<note place="margin">Exod.
31. 15.</note> The same <hi>Moses</hi> says, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
doth</hi> ANY <hi>work on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day,
he shall</hi> SURELY <hi>be put
to death;</hi> Ergo, <hi>He cannot be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd.</hi>
If such <hi>Logick were good,</hi> it
would <hi>conclude all men</hi> to be <hi>unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donably
guilty of death;</hi> seeing (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve)
there is no man who on
<hi>some Lords-day,</hi> has not done <hi>some
work,</hi> and therefore (by such Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
as this) must be unpardonably
<hi>guilty of death.</hi> But enough of this,
for indeed such arguments do not
deserve any serious <hi>answer or confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation.</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:64424:77"/>
Sure I am, that never <hi>any
Christian Church or State</hi> did, (or had
<hi>any reason</hi> to) believe, That the
<hi>severe Jewish Law,</hi> for the <hi>observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Sabbath,</hi> did <hi>oblige Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
and therefore there neither <hi>is,</hi>
nor <hi>can be</hi> any more reason why
their <hi>severe Law</hi> against <hi>Murder</hi>
should be now <hi>obligatory to Gentiles
or Christians,</hi> to whom it <hi>was never
given.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. When the Law says,<note place="margin">Num. 35. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>The
Murderer shall</hi> SURELY <hi>die;</hi> our
<hi>best</hi>

                  <hi>Commentators</hi> (out of the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins</hi>)
say that this is <hi>spoken to the
Judges,</hi> before whom such Causes
regularly came. Now <hi>those Judges
in the Jewish Commonwealth</hi> were <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by the Supreme</hi>

                  <hi>Power,</hi> and
by <hi>his Authority judged</hi> and <hi>determined
Causes under him.</hi> Admit then, that
the Judges (who were Magistrates
<hi>Subordinate to the Supreme</hi> Power)
were to <hi>take no satisfaction</hi> for the

                  <hi>life of a Murderer,</hi> but were (by <hi>that
Law) oblig'd to condemn</hi> and <hi>execute
him;</hi> yet it does not hence follow,
that the <hi>Supreme Power</hi> (who made
<hi>them Judges</hi>) might not (in <hi>some ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses)
reprive</hi> or <hi>pardon some,</hi> whom
they <hi>had condemn'd.</hi> Sure I am, that
<hi>David</hi> (the best of Kings) who
<hi>knew the Jewish Laws</hi> as well as any,
<hi>did reprive</hi> Joab, who had <hi>murder'd
Amasa</hi> and <hi>Abner,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King. 2. 5, 6.</note> and <hi>delay'd the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution</hi>

the <hi>pardon</hi> of <hi>Absolon</hi> to <hi>David</hi> as
<hi>crimes</hi> or <hi>transgressions of the Law of

when it is expressy said, <hi>That
David did that which was right in the
eyes of the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King. 15. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>and turned not aside,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64424:78"/>
from</hi> ANY THING, <hi>that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi>
him, ALL THE DAYS
OF HIS LIFE, <hi>save</hi> ONLY <hi>in
the matter of</hi> Uriah <hi>the</hi> Hittite.</p>
               <p>Now, if notwithstanding those
<hi>Mosaical Penal Laws,</hi> it was <hi>lawful
for David,</hi> the <hi>Supreme Power</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Jews,</hi> (to <hi>whom those
Penal Laws</hi> were <hi>given,</hi> and <hi>they
bound to the</hi> observation of them:)
I say, if <hi>David might lawfully Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive</hi>
and <hi>Pardon Murderers,</hi> how can
it by <hi>those very Laws</hi> be <hi>unlawful</hi>
for the <hi>Christian Supreme Power and
Gentiles</hi> (to whom those Laws
were <hi>never given,</hi> nor they <hi>ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the obligation of them</hi>) to <hi>reprive</hi>
or <hi>pardon</hi> such <hi>condemned malefactors?</hi>
In short, <hi>the sum</hi> of what I <hi>have
said, endeavour'd to prove,</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
to be true,</hi> is this:</p>
               <p>1. That there is no <hi>Law of God
or Man</hi> which does <hi>prohibit,</hi> (and so
make it <hi>unlawful</hi> for) <hi>Supreme Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:64424:79"/>
to grant such <hi>Reprives</hi> and
<hi>Pardons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That the <hi>end of all Penal
Laws,</hi> and of their <hi>due Execution,</hi>
is, that the <hi>honour of our great</hi> and
most Gracious God, and his <hi>true
Worship and Religion</hi> be <hi>preserved,</hi>
and, <hi>Ne quid detrimenti capiat Respu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blica,</hi>
that the <hi>Commonwealth be not
damnify'd,</hi> by <hi>too usual</hi> and <hi>frequent
granting pardons!</hi> For too <hi>great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity</hi>
will occasion and <hi>encourage
Impiety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That all <hi>loyal</hi> and faithful
<hi>subjects</hi> are <hi>bound,</hi> (and have <hi>good
reason</hi>) <hi>to believe,</hi> that his Sacred
Majesty, as he is <hi>Gods immediate
Vicegerent, Defender of the Faith,</hi> and
whose <hi>greatest Interest</hi> it is to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
those good ends,</hi> so he <hi>will care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi>
endeavour (by a <hi>due Execution</hi>
of our good Laws) to <hi>attain those
ends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. That <hi>such Cases</hi> heretofore
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64424:79"/>
                  <hi>have,</hi> and may <hi>again happen,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
(the <hi>time, persons,</hi> and all other
<hi>Circumstances duly consider'd</hi>) a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive</hi>
may not only be <hi>lawful,</hi> but
<hi>necessary:</hi> And wherein a <hi>Pardon</hi>
may <hi>conduce</hi> every <hi>way as much,</hi> (and
possibly in some <hi>Cases more</hi>) for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the <hi>good ends of Penal Laws,</hi>
as a <hi>perpetual, severe,</hi> and <hi>rigorous
execution</hi> of them. And of <hi>such Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
the <hi>King is the Supreme and sole
Judge,</hi> who (if <hi>need</hi> be) may call
for, and have <hi>The advice</hi> and <hi>counsel</hi>
of any of his <hi>Subjects,</hi> of whose
<hi>prudence</hi> and <hi>piety</hi> he is <hi>well assur'd.</hi>
This is the sum and substance of
what I have said, at <hi>several times,
to several persons;</hi> to <hi>confirm them
in the belief,</hi> and <hi>incourage them to a
just vindication</hi> of His Majesties
<hi>Legal Rights</hi> and <hi>undoubted Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.</hi>
And what I have done in
this, was a <hi>duty</hi> I did <hi>owe to my</hi> Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Soveraign, not only by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

                  </p>
                  <p>3. After this, <hi>Anno.</hi> 1671: The said <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina</hi>
Marries Mr. <hi>Cottington,</hi> (her former

of <hi>Turin</hi>'s Sentence, whether it
was valid or void) and injoyn'd them to
Co-habit.</p>
                  <p>2. This is <hi>the Case,</hi> and the <hi>Query is,</hi>
Whether Mr. <hi>Cottington</hi> (after a
just and serious consideration
of the Premises) may acknowledge,<note place="margin">The Query.</note>
take and use <hi>Gallina</hi> as a lawful Wife
without <hi>Sin;</hi> and so with a safe <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
and (without Danger or Fear of
offending God) with security to his
Soul?</p>
                  <p>3. This is the <hi>Case of Conscience</hi> in which
my Opinion is desired,<note place="margin">The Answer.</note> which
how insignificant soever it
may prove, yet (in <hi>Obedience</hi> to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of that <hi>Excellent and Noble Person</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:64424:83"/>
who requires it, and <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi>
to the doubting Gentleman, and
discharge of my own Duty (as a <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi>)
I shall willingly give it, and
plainly set down what (at present) I
conceive truth in the <hi>Case,</hi> and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
why I do so.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Premises</hi> then (as before set
down) being supposed true, and (as to
matter of Fact) granted, (with sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to the better Judgments, of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of greater Knowledg in Divinity,
the <hi>Common,</hi> Canon and <hi>Civil Laws,</hi>) my
answer is Negative: That Mr. <hi>Cotting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
cannot (with a safe Conscience, and
security from Sin) acknowledg, take and
use <hi>Gallina</hi> as his lawful Wife. And this
seems to me, not only a Probable, but
a certain and evident Truth.</p>
                  <p>That this may appear, I consider.</p>
                  <p>1. That 'tis certain and confess'd that
the Obligation of the Matrimonial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
is not grounded on any Positive
constitution of Man, but on the <hi>Divine
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64424:83"/>
Law of God and</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Jus naturale quod instinctu nature non constitutione aliqua ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betur, ut viri &amp; faemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne conjunctio. Can Jus naturale <hi>7. Dist.</hi> I. &amp; L. Jus naturale I In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stit. de Jure Nat. Gent. &amp; Civil.</note> 
                     <hi>Nature.</hi> For although
the contract cannot be
made without the posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
consent of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
yet the consent once
pass'd, the Obligation to
conjugal Duties ariseth
immediately from the
Law of Nature.</p>
                  <p>2. Hence it is, That this Matrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
contract (while the<note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom 7. 2. 3.</hi> The Wife is bound to her Husband so long as he liveth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Parties</hi> live) is
Immutable and Indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensable;
and therefore
Marriage (in the<note n="c" place="margin">Modestinus Leg. Nuptiae I F. De Ritu. nuptiarum.</note>
Law is defin'd to be,
<hi>Maris &amp; Faeminae Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio,
Divini &amp; humani Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris communicatio, &amp; omnis vitae consortium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. And hence it follows evidently;
That if the conjugall contract between
<hi>Patrimoniale</hi> and <hi>Gallina,</hi> was (<hi>Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium
legittimum &amp; ratum</hi>) a legall and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
marriage, <hi>ab Origine;</hi> and when it
was made, then it continues so, (both
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64424:84"/>
parties being yet living) and was and
still is valid and obligatory. If it was a
just and valid contract in 1664. it must
continue, and be so now, in this year,
1677.</p>
                  <p>4. And further, if this be true and
granted, that <hi>Gallina</hi>'s Marriage with
<hi>Patrimoniale</hi> in, 1664. was and to this
day continues valid; then her Marriage
with Mr. <hi>Cottington,</hi> Anno. 1671. is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<hi>Null,</hi> and to all intents and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
void; for first, <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilium

<hi>Gallina</hi>'s pre-contract and
marriage to her former
Husband, was legal and valid, when
her subsequent Marriage with Mr. <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington,</hi>
was an evident violation of the
<hi>Law of Nature,</hi> (which indispensably
oblig'd her to be Faithfull to her former
Husband,) and of her Faith before So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64424:84"/>
given to another, and so abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
Null, and in it self Void. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
It is consonant

                     <hi>nemo potest alterâ parte invitâ,

recedere.</hi> And therefore,
if <hi>Gallina</hi>'s conjugal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
with <hi>Patrimoniale,</hi>
was perfect and legally
valid, she could not
(without manifest Injustice) recede
from it, leave him, and adhere to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Husband.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Matrimony</hi> (as generally in other
contracts,) our consent
in<note n="g" place="margin">Contractus ab Initio voluntatis, expost facto, necessitatis. Gothofred in notis ad dictam legem sicut. <hi>Lit. 1.</hi>
                     </note> making them, is,
(and should be) free and

they are made, their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
and our Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64424:85"/>
of them is necessary. So that if
this be so, if the Matrimonial contract
between <hi>Patrimoniale</hi> and <hi>Gallina</hi> be legall
and really valid, then no power on
Earth or (<hi>de Jure</hi>) can oblige Mr. <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington</hi>
to Co-habit with <hi>Gallina,</hi> as with
his <hi>Lawfull Wife;</hi> seeing on the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Hypothesis, she is indeed Wife to
another Man. And if any (though the
Supreme Authority) should command
Mr. <hi>Cottington</hi> so to <hi>Co-habit</hi> with <hi>Gallina,</hi>
this were to require him to live in impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and abominable <hi>Adultery</hi> with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Man's Wife, which as no <hi>Humane
Power</hi> can justly command; so neither
Mr. <hi>Cottington</hi> (nor any other) can obey
without wounding his Conscience, and
hazard of his Soul and Salvation. Tis
active Obedience I mean, for if such
commands should come, though we
cannot do what's requir'd yet we may,
and ought quietly to undergoe the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment,
<hi>&amp; agere &amp; pati fortia Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
est,</hi> no Courage like that of a good
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64424:85"/>
Christian; who will suffer any thing
patiently from his Governour, rather
than sin against his God.</p>
                  <p>2. The next <hi>Query</hi> will be concerning
the <hi>Invalidity and Nullity of</hi> Gallina'<hi>s Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
with</hi> Patrimoniale. For if it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
Null (as it seems, some do, and
would persuade others to believe) then
the Case is alter'd; Mr. <hi>Cottington</hi> may
and ought to Co-habit with <hi>Gallina,</hi> as
his lawfull Wife. For if her first Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
were indeed a Nullity, then her
second with Mr. <hi>Cottington,</hi> will be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and valid, and he obliged to Co-ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
with her, as her undoubted Husband.
Now in the Case propos'd, I find but
two <hi>Mediums</hi> brought to induce a belief,
that <hi>Gallina</hi>'s Marriage with <hi>Patrimoniale</hi>
was a Nullity.</p>
                  <p>1. The Authority and Judicial Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the Archbishop of <hi>Turine,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
it to be a Nullity.</p>
                  <p>2. The reason alledged (on which
it seems that sentence was grounded)
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64424:86"/>
drawn from the Force and Fear, which
made <hi>Gallina</hi>'s consent involuntary.</p>
                  <p>Now I conceive (with submission to
better Judgments) that these <hi>Mediums</hi> are
too weak and insufficient to give satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Mr. <hi>Cottington,</hi> or to quiet his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
so as that he may, without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
or doubting Co-habit with <hi>Gallina.</hi>
For if he should Co-habit with her, and
only doubt of the Lawfullness of it, he
<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 14. 2. 3.</note>certainly sins. It is a
received and certain rule
amongst <hi>Casuists,</hi> That <hi>quicquid fit reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tante
vel dubitante conscientiâ est peccatum.</hi>
If may Conscience tell me 'tis not, or
doubt whether the thing I do be good
and <hi>Lawfull</hi> (what ever it be) I sin if I
do it. And that's the meaning of that
saying of the Apostle (many times mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken)
<hi>whatsoever is not of Faith is Sin.</hi>
That is, whoever does any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a <hi>Moral Certainty,</hi> that what he does
is just and lawfull, he sins in doing it.
Now concerning the former of those
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64424:86"/>
two <hi>Mediums,</hi> the Archbishop's judicial
Sentence in this <hi>Case,</hi> it is to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="i" place="margin">1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> For the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Turin's</hi> Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</note> That admit that Archbishop and

both concurr'd in giving the same Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,

                  <p>2. Nor can such Sentence (if the

same Sentence, in the same or the like
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64424:87"/>
Case, or be any just bar or reason to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them to give the contrary Sentence.
All know that <hi>a Facto ad jus non sequitur

or may do so is evidently inconsequent.

in their Convocations call'd for that

                     <hi>Judg'd that Marriage to be

and in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s

                     <hi>according to the laws
of God.</hi> The Sentences
of that Supreme Court
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64424:87"/>
are contradictory, and <hi>ergo;</hi> one of them
(be which it may be, is evidently <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true
and Erroneous,</hi>) and therefore can
neither be a just Warrant for any in
<hi>England</hi> to approve it, or judg accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to it, or a just Bar or Let to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
us to judge the Contrary. Now,
if notwithstanding the respect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
we owe to that <hi>Supreme Court,</hi>
we may, in this (and many the like
Cases) disapprove its definitive Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and be of a contrary Judgment.
Then much more may we disapprove,
and be of a Judgment contrary to the
definitive Sentence of the Archbishop
of <hi>Turin,</hi> who is in nothing our <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi>
nor hath any Authority or Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
in <hi>England;</hi> especially in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Fact, wherein neither that Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
nor the Pope himself (though
the <hi>Jesuites</hi> and some <hi>Canonists</hi> be of the
contrary opinion) pretend to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:64424:88"/>
And once more, as the definitive Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of any Popish Archbishop, or of
the Pope himself in his Consistory, or in
a general Counsel can be no good Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
or just ground, to warrant any
Protestant Judge or Court, to judge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
or any legall Barr or Let to
hinder them to give a contrary Sentence;
so sure I am, that no such Sentence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by such Persons and Judges in any
of their Courts, Consistories or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells,
can be a sufficient ground for Mr.
<hi>Cottington</hi> to relie upon, to give stisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and quiet to his Conscience, so as
to secure him, that he may safely and
without sin, <hi>Co-habit with</hi> Gallina; as
with his <hi>Lawfull Wife;</hi> only because
they have pronounced her Marriage
with <hi>Patrimoniale</hi> to be a <hi>Nullity.</hi> For
(besides that he has many Reasons (if
they may be heard, as in Law and

that Sentence, and to believe it illegall
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64424:88"/>
and injust. The thing is evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
definitive Sentences given not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Inferiour, but in Superiour Courts,
and General Councils, are so far from
giving satisfaction to Protestants or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
or quieting their Consciences in a
belief of what is in such Sentences judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
defin'd; that in many things they
actually dissent, and confidently deny
such Definitions. so it was the <hi>Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Sentence</hi> of a Popish<note n="a" place="margin">In the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>Anno,</hi> Hen. <hi>8. 22. Domini. 1531.</hi> Vid. Antiquit. Britan. in Archie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopo <hi>Warham,</hi> p. 325.</note> Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

yet the Sentence of those

give little satisfaction to
our Papists now, who
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64424:89"/>
absolutely deny such Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy.
So the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
and Parliament
(in the beginning of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s
Reign) by their definitive Sentence E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
Popery here in <hi>England,</hi> which
gave as little satisfaction to Protestants,
who did both believe and know that the
Religion Established was Erroneous,
and therefore the Establishment, by the
Law of God and the Gospel, unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and unjust. In short, the ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
and only rule of Conscience,
(which can satisfie and quiet it, and on
which it may securely relie for sure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections)
is the will of God made known
to us, (<hi>lumine naturae, aut scripturae</hi>) by
natural Reason, or Divine Revelation
in Scripture. For what ever can be
made appear to us, by clear and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
Reason, grounded on Nature
or Scripture, <hi>de faciendâ, aut fugiendâ,</hi> this
may and will satisfie, and secure our
Conscience, so that we may innocently
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64424:89"/>
act accordingly; but otherwise, no
Sentence of any Man or Court, (<hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical</hi>
or <hi>Temporal</hi>) can do it, unless the
Reasons of such Sentence be (and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be) sufficient. And this brings
me to the second <hi>Medium,</hi> express'd in
the Case, to shew the Marriage of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimoniale</hi>
and <hi>Gallina</hi> to be a <hi>Nullity.</hi>
                     <note n="2" place="margin">The reason al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for the Nullity.</note>The reason alledged in
the Case, as the ground
of the Archbishop of <hi>Turin</hi>'s Sentence,
and of the Nullity of the said Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
is this: That <hi>Gallina</hi> was under a
Force and Fear, caus'd by her Father, by
reason whereof her consent was not
voluntary, (as by<note n="a" place="margin">L. <hi>12. &amp;</hi> L. 14. Cod. de nuptiis &amp; Leg. <hi>21. &amp; 22.</hi> F. de Ritu nuptiarum cap. Cum locum 14. extra De Sponsali &amp; Matrimonijs.</note> Law) it ought to
be; and therefore the
Matrimonial contract
(for want of such a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
and free consent)
invalid and a Nullity.
But thisreason is too
weak, and altogether insufficient.</p>

as may appear if we consider,</p>
                  <p>1. That 'tis the avow'd Judgment of
a <hi>Person Eminent</hi> for his great knowledge
of all Learning, especially of the Laws,
that no Fear, how great soever (humane
Constitutions secluded) does make the
actions which proceed from it<note n="b" place="margin">

                  <p>2.

and that absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not upon any

and an<note n="d" place="margin">Aristotle Ethic. Nicom. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. and Rhodius, <hi>and all his Scholiasts and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators there.</hi>

of <hi>Aristotle;</hi> who
saies, <hi>That he who in a

and Danger he is then in, he is absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
willing to loose them, and cast them into
the Sea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor is it <hi>Aristotle</hi> only and <hi>Grotius,</hi>
who say this, but all the <hi>Scholiasts</hi> and
<hi>Commentators</hi> on <hi>Aristotle,</hi> both <hi>Greek</hi> and
<hi>Latine,</hi> which I have yet seen, say the
same thing. And then, if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Judgment of so many and
so learned Men, be valuable, as no
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64424:91"/>
doubt it is, fear, as is pretended, does
not make those Actions whose Principle
it is, involuntary, and the truth of this,
is further and beyond dispute evident.</p>
                  <p>3. Because Fear is the Principle which
makes such Actions voluntary, and the
Person under such fear willing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them. For tis evident, that there
is nothing which makes a Man in a
<hi>Storm</hi> willing to cast his Goods into the
<hi>Sea,</hi> but the fear to loose his <hi>Ship</hi> and
his <hi>Life,</hi> if he do not so. Nay, second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
so far is fear from making our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
Involuntary, that the greater the
fear is, they are by it made more vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary;
for no Man before he was in
fear, was ever, willing to cast his Goods
into the <hi>Sea,</hi> but after the <hi>Storm</hi> and
his <hi>Danger</hi> (and so his fear) begun, his
willingness to loose his Goods and save
himself begun too; and as the Danger
and his Fear increased, so proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
his willingness to cast away his
Goods; and when his Danger and Fear
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64424:91"/>
are come to the height, then, and not
till then, he is absolutely willing to cast
them into the <hi>Sea,</hi> and makes hast to
put that will in Execution; being as
really desirous and willing to loose his
Goods, as by so doing to save his <hi>Ship</hi>
and himself, so that if fear made our
actions Involuntary, then the more the
fear was they would be more Involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary;
whereas the contrary is evident,
that as our fear increaseth, so our wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness
to do those actions which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
from it.</p>
                  <p>4. The fear and force <hi>Gallina</hi> pretends
to make her contract with <hi>Patrimoniale,</hi>
a Nullity. was from her own Father:
It is pretended, her Father forc'd her to
consent; whence it appears, that she
had her Father's consent and command
to marry him, and may be, many and
severe Threatnings too, if she did not
Marry him: Whether this was so, or
not, I know not; but if it was so, yet
this neither did, nor by any Law of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64424:92"/>
God or Man, could make her Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
contract a Nullity. First, That any
Law of God, Natural or Positive,
should make the consent, command or
threatnings of a Father sufficient to Null
the consent, and matrimonial contract
of his Daughter, neither is, nor can be
pretended. Secondly, For humane Laws
the <hi>Civilians</hi> and <hi>Canonists</hi> tell us, <hi>That
the fear of a Father makes not the Marriage
or Consent of his Daughter a Nullity.</hi>

there is the same reason for his Daughter
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64424:92"/>
to marry a Husband, which otherwise he
would not have Married; yet the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
is valid, and (by reason of that
force) no Nullity;<note n="c" place="margin">

                  <p>5. I confess, the <hi>Canonists</hi> and <hi>Civilians</hi>
say, That fear makes the consent Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,
and so indces a Nullity.<note n="d" place="margin">

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64424:93"/>
that Law, and the Lawyers<note n="e" place="margin">Panormitan. ad dictum cap. Vinnius, a Beute, Gothofredus, &amp;c. Locis supra cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and say further;
<hi>Quod Matrimonium per me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,
vel minis contractum,
deficiente consensu, est ipso
jure nullum.</hi> But it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
first, That they do not mean a
<hi>Reverential Fear,</hi> a fear of displeasing a
Father; for the same Men, in the same
places say, <hi>That such a fear does not vitiate
the consent,</hi> or make a Nullity: Now all
the fear pretended by <hi>Gallina</hi> (in our
Case) was from her Father. Secondly,
If the fear arise from the many and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Threats of a Father, yet this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make the consent involuntary, and
so a Nullity. I confess, that if a Father
should Command and Threaten his
Daughter to Marry an impious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
Person, the<note n="f" place="margin">Tum solum dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiendi a Patre licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia Filiae conceditur, si indignum moribus, aut turpem sponsum ei Pater eligat, l. sed quae 12. § tunc autem F.

her disobedience;
for in that Case she is

                     <note n="a" place="margin">Parentis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensus in nuptijs libero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum requiritur, ex re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verentia parentis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bita, nisi manifeste iniqua sit Parentis vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas. Grotius de jure Belli lib. 2. Oap. 5. § 10.</note>not by Law bound to obey her Father's
commands or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.
But in our Case,
no such indignity or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity
of <hi>Patrimoniale</hi>'s
person is complain'd of,
or so much as pretended
for a cause why <hi>Gallina</hi>'s consent should
be involuntary, and the conjugal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
a Nullity.</p>
                  <p>Now if this be true, and the Law it self
says it; That, <hi>tum solum dissentiendi a Patre
licentia Filie &amp; conceditur, cum indignum moribus
aut turpem sponsum ei Pater eligat.</hi> If the
<hi>Law</hi> allow a <hi>Daughter</hi> to disobey her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
commands (proposing a Huband to
<hi>her</hi>) only in such <hi>Case;</hi> then if he chuse and
propose a Person better qualified, and no
way unworthy of her, and give his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and command, that she shall marry
him (as the matter of Fact was in our
Case) then she is bound to obey him.
For if it be Lawful for a Daughter to
disobey her Father, onely when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64424:94"/>
and unworthy Husband; then,
when he proposes one worthy, she is
bound to obey him. Seeing then the
Husband propos'd to <hi>Gallina,</hi> by her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was no way unworthy of her, but
she bound (upon her Father's consent
and command) to marry him, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
Thirdly, That her actual mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
him, upon her Father's command
and fear to displease him, was an <hi>act of
filial Obedience and Duty,</hi> and therefore
could not possibly vitiate her consent,
and make the conjugal contract involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
invalid, and, as pretended, a Nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Nay, Fourthly, 'tis certain that a Father
hath a just Authority by the Law of
God<note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod. 20. 12.</hi> Honour thy Father and thy Mother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> and Nature, to consider and
judge what is good for
his Children, and not
only to command their
Obedience, but to use
<hi>Threats and Menaces;</hi> yea, and <hi>Castigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Whippings too,</hi> to make them do
their Duty, and obey his just commands;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64424:94"/>
so our Heavenly Father commands us
to obey his Laws, useth <hi>Menaces, threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
Death</hi> and <hi>Damnation</hi> if we do not;
and these <hi>Means</hi> he has appointed,
Threatnings as well as Promises, to
make us willing to do what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
our Duty. And therefore to
say, that such Paternal Commands and
Threatnings (whether of our Heavenly
or Earthly Parents) can be a just ground,
to make our consents to such commands
involuntary, which he has ordain'd to
make us give a willing and voluntary
Obedience, is to Blaspheme his infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wise Providence, and to say that the
means which he has appointed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a willing and voluntary consent in
us to obey his Commands and do our
Duty, has a necessary and contrary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and makes them involuntary. So
that it being granted that <hi>Gallina</hi>'s
Father commanded her to marry <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimoniale,</hi>
and to make her to do it,
added many and severe Threatnings;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64424:95"/>
for<note n="a" place="margin">The Law saies, <hi>L. 2. F.

them would not
have done it) marry
him, this may prove,
that (in those circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
and to avoid her
Father's displeasure) she
willingly made that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal
contract; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is, not can be any
ground to prove that her
consent was involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and so the contract
in valid, as is pretended,
and a Nullity. Fifthly,
And this may further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that such Actions
are not involuntary, by
the consent of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
thus: In the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive

Torments, and Threatnings of

Involuntary, for then it had not been
Sin; <hi>peccatum utique non est peccatum nisi

Christian World judg'd it to be a great
Sin, and Ecclesiastical Punishments,

That such pretended, but not

ground of a <hi>Nullity;</hi> for while no force

did by legal Proofs appear, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible

whether it was such as could cause a
<hi>Nullity.</hi> I say Mr. <hi>Cottington</hi> having no

he cannot with Innocence and a safe

                  <p>Lastly: But let it be granted (tho it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear

was under some force and fear, at the
time of her <hi>Marriage;</hi> so that her consent
was not so voluntary and free, as other

of any such force or fear, or that
her consent was involuntary, though
she had all that time, and being in a
safe place, many opportunities to have
done it, which spontaneous and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Co-habitation with her Husband,
was a legal confirmation and ratihabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of her first consent; so that it was
sufficient to make the conjugal contract

if a Woman do prove
that her conjugal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64424:98"/>
at first involuntary; yet if afterwards, she
willingly did Co-habit with her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and he had Carnal knowledge of
Her, the fear is Purg'd (though it was
at first a just fear) and the Matrimonial
contract valid and Obligatory. The
words are these—<hi>Quae invita probat se
sponsalia contraxisse, si comperiatur postea
sponte cognita ad matrimonii Dissolutionem
proclamare &amp; metum causare non poterit.</hi>
And the <hi>Lemma</hi> or <hi>Title</hi> of that Paragraph
is this; <hi>Justus metus si purgatus fuerit,</hi> and

see that a just fear, and that proved,
makes no Nullity nor Invalidity, if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
she willingly consent to Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Knowledge, and give due benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to her Husband. But <hi>Gallina</hi>'s
fear, in our Case, was pretended only,
not prov'd; she Co-habited with him
willingly eighteen Months, and had a

                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That though the Womans
Act was at first involuntary, yet her
Co-habitation with her Husband (for
a year and a half) ratifi'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
the Matrimonial Contract;
and therefore, in our Case, had <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina</hi>'s
consent been at first involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
(which is not proved) yet her
Co-habitation with her Husband for a
year and a half (especially having a
Child in that time by him) did by the
same Law ratifie the former, though
involuntary contract.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That by this Sentence and
Law of the <hi>Pope,</hi> the Woman having
liv'd with her Husband a year and a
half, that Co-habitation had so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
and ratified the conjugal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
<hi>ex post facto,</hi> that although, <hi>ab ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi>
it were involuntary; yet that could
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64424:102"/>
not cause any Nullity or Invalidity in
the Marriage or Contract which made
it. And therefore the Pope and the
Law say,—<hi>Qu'd Testes de caetero non
sunt recipiendi, quia mora tanti temporis hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jusmodi
probationem excludit.</hi> It was in
the Pope's Judgment, against Reason
and Law, after a spontaneous Co-habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
for a year and a half, to admit of
Witnesses to prove that her consent was
(at first) involuntary, in order to a
Nullity of the Matrimonial Contract;
seeing that being granted, it did not
follow that there was any Nullity or
Invalidity in the said Contract; and
therefore the Pope truly judg'd, that
it was impertinent to bring Witnesses to
prove that, which (in that Case) was
indeed granted; and otherwise, if it
had been proved, could no way profit
them: The subsequent spontaneous Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation
having abundantly ratified
the Contract, and supplied the defects
of the first involuntary consent. And
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64424:102"/>
hence, it farther follows, and (if I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
not) evidently,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That the Sentence of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>Turin</hi> (in <hi>Gallina</hi>'s Case) was
repugnant and directly contradictory to
Law. <hi>First,</hi> Because he admitted and
examined no Witnesses which (in such
case) the Law expresly forbids. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
In that he by his definitive Sentence,
judg'd and declared that to be a Nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which the establish'd, and, though
may be not to him, the known Laws
and the Pope too, had declared and
judg'd to be none.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That therefore that Sentence
of the Archbishop (being against Law,
and the definitive Sentence of the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Judge</hi>) was absolutely and in it
self<note n="a" place="margin">

                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And then such sentence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(by the Laws Civil and Sacred)
absolutely Null; it follows, that the

                  <p>The premises considered, I think

                  <head>Query. Whether the Bishops of

a Sentence of the Archbishop
of Turin?</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>My Honoured Friend,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Understand by your Letter, that
some say (who they are, I neither
know nor inquire) <hi>that the King and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of</hi> England <hi>have no Power to Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Archbishop of</hi> Turin's <hi>Sentence, given
in the Case of</hi> Patrimoniale <hi>and</hi> Gallina.
I confess, I do not a little wonder at the
strangeness of their Position; the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
because (having consulted very
learned Divines and Lawyers,) I can find
no ground for it. But, on the other
side, many (to me) evident reasons to
the contrary, which I submit to your
Censure: <hi>&amp; si quid novisti rectius, candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64424:104"/>
imperti,</hi> and I will be your thankful
Proselyte. Here then, I consider, that
a Sentence of the Archbishop of <hi>Turin,</hi>
may be either,
<list>
                        <item>1. Such as concerns his own Subjects
onely, over whom he has a just Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Jurisdiction.</item>
                        <item>2. Or, such as may concern one or
more of the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the first I conceive it is certain,
<hi>First,</hi> That the Archbishop of <hi>Turin,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(as to all his Subjects) a legal Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior,
obedience is due to him. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Law with them of <hi>Rome,</hi> (and I shall
not deny it) that in<note n="a" place="margin">In dubijs, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum est sententiae su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periorum, maxime Pontificum. Fillucius Quaest. moral. Trac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat. 10. <hi>c.</hi> 2. Quaest. 8. §. 55. Can. Quod culpatur. 4. Caus. 23. Quaest. 1. &amp; cap. Ad aures. 5. extra De Temp. ordinandorum.</note> things lawfull,
or dubious, the subject
must stand to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of his Superiours; they have no
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64424:104"/>
power to question or rescind his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> And 'tis granted, that
the King and Bishops of <hi>England,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have, nor pretend to have any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to question any Sentence of that Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
(which only concerns his own
Subjects) so as to rescind, make it Null,
or not Obligatory. For that cannot be
done, save by a power Superior to that
of the Archbishop; such as neither the
King nor the Bishops of <hi>England</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> But I think it as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that the King and Bishops of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
may question any Sentence of the
Archbishop of <hi>Turin,</hi> or the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
so far, as to consider and examine
the Truth or Justice of it (when there
is a just occasion, and our King or his
Subjects concern'd) and approve or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn,
admit or reject it, when and so
far as (all circumstances considered)
they find it just and true, or otherwise,
as shall (God willing) anon appear.
But of such Sentences, I suppose, the
present Query is not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:64424:105"/>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> But the question principally
is concerning such Sentence, wherein
a Subject of <hi>England</hi> is concern'd, (as
in Mr. <hi>Cottington</hi>'s Case) who owes Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
and Subjection to his King, and
may expect protection from him. Now
in this case, the Archbishop's Sentence
might either be.</p>
                  <p>1. For Co-habitation, requiring Mr.
<hi>Cottington</hi> to Co-habit with <hi>Gallina:</hi> to
give her due Benevolence and Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
                  <p>2. Or, only to declare a Nullity of the
Matrimonial Contract between <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniale</hi>
and <hi>Gallina.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the first, If the Archbishop's Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
was such as required Co-habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that Mr. <hi>Cottington</hi> should give due
Benevolence and Maintenance to <hi>Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi>
Then his Sentence was absolutely
Null, <hi>Quia à non judice lata,</hi> (that
Archbishop having no Jurisdiction over
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64424:105"/>
Mr. <hi>Cottington</hi>) and an usurpation of the
just Rights of our King, the Supreme,
and of our Bishops who (from and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him) have a sub-ordinate Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
over the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> and
so over Mr. <hi>Cottington.</hi> Sure I am, the
Archbishop of <hi>Turin</hi> had no Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
over Mr. <hi>Cottington,</hi> a subject of the
King of <hi>England. First,</hi> Not Supreme;
that's only in our King, as our Laws and
Oaths testifie. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Not Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate;
for that must be derived from
the King, who surely never gave the
Archbishop of <hi>Turin</hi> any Jurisdiction
over Mr. <hi>Cottington,</hi> or any of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
And therefore, if the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Turin</hi>'s Sentence was such, our
King and Bishops might justly question
and censure it, for what it was, a Nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and an illegal usurpation of the
Rights of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the second, If the Archbishop of
<hi>Turin</hi>'s Sentence was only, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial
Contract between <hi>Patrimoniale</hi>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:64424:106"/>
and <hi>Gallina,</hi> was a Nullity; then I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That it is confess'd, that <hi>Res</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Leg. Res judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta 207. F. De Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis juris.</note>

and to all intents and

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> But let the
Archbishop's Sentence,
as to the Nullity, be
what it will, true or
false, just or unjust; yet
if it concerns a Subject
of <hi>England,</hi> our King
and Bishops have good
reason, and a just power to question and
examine it; and according to its Validity
or Nullity, admit or reject it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And that it does highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
a <hi>Subject</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> is evident: For
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64424:107"/>
although <hi>ab Origine,</hi> it concern'd only
<hi>Patrimoniale</hi> and <hi>Gallina,</hi> two of his own
<hi>Subjects;</hi> yet Mr. <hi>Cottington</hi> having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
or since the Sentence, I know not,
married <hi>Gallina:</hi> He is highly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be sure, that the Archbishop's Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
is just and true. For if it be not,
if indeed there be no Nullity in that
Contract, then what Casuist or Court
soever determines and decrees, that he
shall Co-habit with <hi>Gallina</hi> as his Wife;
does (<hi>ipso facto</hi>) decree,
<list>
                        <item>1. That he shall Co-habit with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Man's Wife.</item>
                        <item>2. That he shall live in continual
Adultery.</item>
                        <item>3. That if he have any Children by
her, they are none of his; for, <hi>is
pater est, quem nuptioe demonstrant.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4. And so in case she out live him,
he shall not be in a possibility, to
leave any lawfull Issue to continue
his Name and Family to Posterity.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:64424:108"/>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If then the Archbishop's Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
be untrue, if the contract between
<hi>Patrimoniale</hi> and <hi>Gallina,</hi> was <hi>Matrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
ratum,</hi> and no <hi>Nullity;</hi> then all those
sad or sinful consequences, will necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
follow; and so not only Mr. <hi>Cotting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
by Co-habiting with another Man's
Wife, but his Judges too, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
such Co-habitation, will be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of those horrid Impieties. For if it
be true, as undoubtedly it is, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
who<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Qui non prohibit peccare cum possit, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet.</hi> So 1 Sam. 3. 13. Eli is declared guilty of his Sons impleties, because he restrain'd them not.</note> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits
not Impieties,
when 'tis in his power,
is himself guilty of
them: Then much
more will he be guilty,
who expresly commands
them. And that Magistrate, whoever
he be, who by a judicial Sentence,
commands Mr. <hi>Cottington</hi> to Co-habit
with another Man's Wife, for so she is,
in case there be no Nullity, commands
him to commit and continue in <hi>Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>

                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It will therefore, both in
<hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Conscience,</hi> highly concern
our Bishops and Ecclesiastical Judges,
to whom the cognizance of this cause
belongs, that they be<note n="b" place="margin">As a Subject may not disobey his Superior unless he be morally sure that what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands is <hi>illicitum</hi> and sinful; so a Superiour may not command, unless he be morally sure, that what he commands is <hi>licitum</hi> and not sinful. <hi>Vid. Rob. Lincoln. de obligat. Cons. Praelect. 6. §</hi> 16. pag. 227.</note>
morally sure, that the
Contract between <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimoniale</hi>
and <hi>Gallina</hi>
was indeed a Nullity,
before they decree and
require Mr. <hi>Cottington</hi> to
Co-habit with her. It is
evidently repugnant to
the nature of Justice,
and the integrity of a
just Judge, to give a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
damnatory Sentence, upon an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
and dubious Ground. Now 'tis
absolutely impossible, that any Man
should be sure of such a <hi>Nullity</hi> as is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the Archbishop's Sentence, unless
he know the reasons on which that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
is grounded, and that they are such,
as efficaciously prove the <hi>Nullity:</hi> And if
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64424:109"/>
Mr. <hi>Cottington</hi> doubt of the Nullity (as
of necessity he must, till by some ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
medium it appear) and be not sure,
<hi>Gallina</hi> is indeed his Wife; I am sure he
sins, if he Co-habit with her, seeing he
Co-habits with one, who (for ought he
knows) is another Man's Wife. And
then the Rule is certain, <hi>Quicquid fit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctante

declared that Contract to be a
Nullity. It is confessed, but that is no

Reasons on which his Sentence is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,

to prove such Nullity. That Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64424:114"/>
that any Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,

think, that a Sentence
of the Pope to depose
a King and absolve his
Subjects from all Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

as is not to be question'd by the King,
his Bishops, or any loyal Subjects? If
so, good night to Monarchy, and all
the royal Rights of Kings; the Pope
may when he will depose and deprive
them of all their <hi>Jura Regalia,</hi> and their
Subjects (though by the Law of God
and Man obliged to it) must not assist
them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ninthly,</hi> It is to be considered, That
our present Case is an Ecclesiastical,
not a Civil Cause, concerning the Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
or Nullity of a Matrimonial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract;
which both by
<note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Vid. Statut.</hi> 24. Hen. 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> 12.</note> our Laws, and
those of<note n="c" place="margin">Concil. Trident. sess. 24. De Sacrament. Matrimonij. Can. 12. Quit dicit Causas matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniales non spectare ad judices Ecclesiasticos, Anathema sit.</note> 
                     <hi>Rome</hi> too,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64424:114"/>
is of Ecclesiastical Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance.
Now there
is (both in Law, and
the nature and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
of them) a
great difference between Ecclesiastical,
and Civil Causes. Many instances
might be given, but being not my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
I shall only set down two or
three; thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Had it been an action of Debt,
and the Sentence at <hi>Turin</hi> had been, that
Mr. <hi>Cottington</hi> should pay 500 <hi>l.</hi> to <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina.</hi>
Admit also, that no such Debt was
due, and so the Sentence unjust; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
that at <hi>Gallina</hi>'s instance, that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
had been confirmed, and executed
here in <hi>England,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cottington</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to pay that Summ. It might be a
peice of injustice, and a
sin in the<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Si praelatus ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quum aut durum (quod tamen turpe aut inho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestum non est) impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, &amp; subditus obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatur, &amp; imperatum) faciat, tum unius Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perantis culpa est; tam abest à culpa qui obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur imperio, ut om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nino peccaret si non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequeretur.</hi> Rob. Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colniensis, <hi>de obligat. Conscient. Praelect.</hi> 5. §. 8. <hi>pag.</hi> 165.</note> Judge to
sentence him to pay
what was no way due.
But (as to Mr. <hi>Cotting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>)
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64424:115"/>
it might be his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity,
being compell'd
to pay what he did not
owe, but his crime it
could not be. It could
be no sin in him, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
by his Judge, to
pay that Money, though indeed it was
not due. For he might lawfully have
given <hi>Gallina</hi> so much Money, without
and before any compulsory decree; and
that decree could not make it to him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.
But in our present Matrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Case, it is far otherwise: For if there
was no Nullity in the Contract, and the
Sentence at <hi>Turin</hi> unjust, and if upon that
Sentence, it be decreed here, that Mr.
<hi>Cottington</hi> shall Co-habit with <hi>Gallina,</hi>
here obedience to that unjust Sentence,
will not only be his Calamity, but his
Crime; because in this Case, he Co-ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
with another Man's Wife, and is
guilty of Adultery. Nor will the Judge's
Sentence, requiring such Co-habitation,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64424:115"/>
any way excuse him. And on this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
it highly concerns the Judges
in this case to be assured of the Nullity,
least they sentence Mr. <hi>Cottington</hi> to Co-habit
with another Man's Wife, and so
to sin and commit Adultery. But if
they do, <hi>quod absit,</hi> it as highly concerns
Mr. <hi>Cottington,</hi> to obey God rather than
Men; and though he suffer for it here,
rather disobey an unjust Sentence of an
<hi>earthly Judge,</hi> than the eternally just
Judge of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> and suffer
for it for ever hereafter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has
Ecclesiastical Laws, particularly about
the Validity and Nullity of Matrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Contracts, which neither are nor
ought to be approved by the Church of
<hi>England.</hi> For, 1. They admit the Oaths
and Confessions of the parties desiring
Sentence for divorce or Nullity, and so
it was in our present
case, which the Church
of <hi>England</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Vid. Canones 1 Jacobi. Anno 1603. Can.</hi> 105.</note> admits
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64424:116"/>
not. 2. It is their generally received opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that although the <hi>Matrimonium</hi> be
indeed <hi>ratum,</hi> yet a <hi>Papal Dispensation</hi>
may dissolve the <hi>vinculum conjugale,</hi> and
so induce a Nullity. <hi>Dico,</hi> saies a great

And for Proof

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64424:116"/>
from their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Principles fully
proves it. Now it high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

and his Judges too,
to know on what
grounds the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Turin</hi> gave Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
for a Nullity. For
if it was only on the aforesaid Reasons
and Popish Principles; no Bishop or

will or can admit that Sentence to
be just, or grant a Nullity on such
Grounds, or sentence Mr. <hi>Cottington</hi> to

express, forbidding all
persons whoever they

be, inhabiting or resiant in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
to make use of or excuse the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
or Sentences of any Foreign Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
Court or Judicature; and requires,
upon pain of a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> that all such
Causes be tryed and finally determin'd
within this Realm, by our own Laws
and Judges. The words
are thus,<note n="b" place="margin">The said <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute §. Be it further inacted,</hi> compared with the 2. §. <hi>And whereas the King.</hi>

forenamed) <hi>do procure from</hi> Rome,
<hi>or any other Foreign Court out of this Realm,
any manner of Foreign Process, Sentences,

this to you, and those who do: Only I
observe, 1. That the Word in the Statute
is not Copulative; <hi>If any Man do Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64424:117"/>
and Execute, and do any Act,</hi> &amp;c.
but Disjunctive, <hi>If any Man Procure, or
Execute, or do any Act,</hi> &amp;c. That is,
if any Man do any one of those particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
mention'd; if he either procure such
Foreign Sentences, or Execute, or Abett
and Assist, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Though he do not all,
yet he is liable to the punishment ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by the <hi>Statute.</hi> 2. That the end
of the <hi>Statute,</hi> is, to provide against the
damages and greivances of the <hi>Subjects</hi>
of <hi>England;</hi> and therefore forbids all
Appeals to any <hi>Foreign Court, Prelate</hi> or
the <hi>Pope;</hi> or to bring in any <hi>Foreign Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
Sentence</hi> or <hi>Judgment</hi> given in any
<hi>Foreign Court</hi> whatsoever. And this is
one reason of the Prohibition, which
the <hi>Statute</hi> doth instance
in; because<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Statut. 24. H. 8. Cap.</hi> 12. §. 2. And whereas the King.</note> neither
the necessary proofs nor
the true knowledge of
the Cause, can neither there be so well
known, nor the Witnesses there be so
well examin'd as within the Realm; so
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64424:118"/>
that the parties grieved by means of the
said Appeals, be most times without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.
So that though the Title and
Epigraphe of the <hi>Statute</hi> be against Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals
to any Foreign Judicature; yet
in the body of the <hi>Statute</hi> the bringing
in, and executing of any Foreign Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
Sentence, or Judgment, are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forbid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Now for <hi>Gallina,</hi> no Subject
of <hi>England,</hi> though now resiant here, to
bring in a Sentence of a Foreign Court,
and though the Proofs or Reasons of
it be utterly unknown, to plead it, and
have it, without Examination, executed,
to the Irreparable damage of a Person of
Quality, and a native Subject of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
this seems to me, to be against the
true intent and meaning of this good <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude, I do and must confess,
that of the Laws, I have ventur'd to cite,
Law being none of my Profession, I am
no competent Judge; and therefore,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64424:118"/>
begging your Pardon for my mistakes,
and medling with them, I referr them,
and my self, to You and the <hi>Learned</hi>
Gentlemen of the <hi>Long Robe,</hi> who best
understand them, who can, I know, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
discover my mistakes; and will, I
hope, without any severe Censure par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
them. But for the Theological
part of the Controversie, and the Case
of Conscience, wherein his Judges in the
Ecclesiastical Court, and Mr. <hi>Cottington</hi>
are concern'd; this being within the
compass of my Calling and Profession,
I may, and with modesty, and more
confidence, do affirm, 1. That till the
pretended Nullity of the Matrimonial
Contract, between <hi>Patrimoniale</hi> and <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina,</hi>
do upon just grounds, and such as
may induce a moral certainty, appear,
no Judge can (<hi>Conscientiâ &amp; Justitiâ sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis</hi>)
by a judicial Sentence, require Mr.
<hi>Cottington</hi> to Co-habit with <hi>Gallina.</hi> For
in this Case, <hi>idem est non esse &amp; non appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere;
Gallina</hi> must be reputed <hi>Patrimonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi>'s
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64424:119"/>
Wife, he yet living to whom she
was first contracted (<hi>Solemni Ecclesiae ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu</hi>)
and with whom she Co-habited (<hi>si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
querelâ</hi>) a year and an half, and by
whom she had a Child. I say, she must
be reputed his Wife till it appear she is
not. And 'tis impossible that should
appear, till the Nullity of that first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
be legally and sufficiently proved.
2. And if any Ecclesiastical Judge, should
decree Mr. <hi>Cottington</hi> to Co-habit with
her, before such Nullity (which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
but hitherto no way proved)
do sufficiently and by legal and just
proofs appear; yet, notwithstanding
such Decree, 'tis impossible for him,
with a safe Conscience, to Co-habit
with her, as his Wife: Seeing, for ought
appears, or he knows, she may be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Man's Wife rather than his. And
certainly he is highly concern'd to be
sure, that she is indeed his own Wife,
before he give her that due Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
which without great Impiety and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64424:119"/>
Adultery, cannot possibly be given to
any other, who really is not his Wife,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Certificate annext to the Archbishop's

by the force and fear, that she was put into

with <hi>Patrimoniale,</hi> and that in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
she did not give her free consent;

doth in the Year 1671. marry Mr.
<hi>Cottington;</hi> against whom in the Year
1674. she brings an Action in <hi>Causa Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimoniali,</hi>
before the Dean of the Arches
here in <hi>England,</hi> where she doth Alledge
and prove her Marriage with Mr. <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington;</hi>
to which Mr. <hi>Cottington</hi> doth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
That her first Husband <hi>Patrimoniale</hi>
was and is still alive. She replies, 'tis
true, but that first Marriage of hers was
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64424:120"/>
declared Null and Void by the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's
Sentence; and Mr. <hi>Cottington</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins,
That that Sentence it self was Null

and contrary to Law. The Dean of the
Arches having this Fact before him, doth
give Sentence for this second Marriage
of <hi>Gallina,</hi> and enjoins Mr. <hi>Cottington</hi>
and her to Co-habit; alledging that he
hath no power, and is not by Law to
examine or question the Validity of the
Archbishop's Sentence; but ought, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
any Defects or Nullities
therein, to give Sentence for this second
Marriage of <hi>Gallina.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cotttington</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
That the Dean of the Arches at the
time of his giving Sentence against him,
declared his Mind in Words to this effect,
<hi>viz.</hi> As a private Man, I should look
upon the Sentence of the Archbishop
of <hi>Turin,</hi> for dissolving the Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Patrimoniale</hi> and <hi>Gallina,</hi> to be an
irregular, wrongful, and an unjust Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;
but, as I am a publick Minister,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64424:121"/>
I must look upon it as good against Mr.
<hi>Cottington,</hi> because all Sentences given
beyond Sea by any equal Court, I ought
to look upon as good; whether good or
bad, having no power to reverse or exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
them; and therefore ought to cast
Mr. <hi>Cottington</hi> in this Case.</p>
                  <p>It is not on Mr. <hi>Cottington</hi>'s part deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but that when he Married <hi>Gallina,</hi> he
knew of her being Married to <hi>Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niale,</hi>
and of <hi>Patrimoniale</hi>'s being still a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,
when he the said <hi>Cottington</hi> marry'd
<hi>Gallina;</hi> nor is it alledged and proved
by <hi>Gallina</hi> in this Cause here in <hi>England,</hi>
that she at any time made any Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the pretended force and fear she
was under, or that she used any endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to escape from <hi>Patrimoniale,</hi> when
she was in a safe place, and might have
escaped from him if she had pleased;
but on the contrary, her Co-habitation
with <hi>Patrimoniale</hi> for about twenty
Months, and her having had a Child by
him in that time, and her having the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64424:121"/>
usual liberty of Women in a Married
Estate, during that Co-habitation, hath
been proved in the Court of Arches by
her own Witnesses. But Mr. <hi>Cottington,</hi>
being unwilling to make unnecessary
contests with the Sentences of Courts,
and being now fearful of offending God
or his own Conscience, doth most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
request the Reverend Doctor, <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
Allestry,</hi> the <hi>Regius</hi> Professor of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,

                  <p>Supposing this Case justly stated, and
the matters of Fact true according to

may by Law examine and question
the validity of a Sentence of a Foreign
Judge, and in particular as this Fact
is where it is given in a Matrimonial
Cause?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:64424:125"/>
                     <hi>A.</hi> We conceive that the Judge of
one Territory cannot directly examine
and question the Sentence of a Foreign
Judge, because he hath no Superiority
over him. But if it happens that such
Sentence doth upon any incident come
before him; as if he be requested to put
the same in Execution, or if one of the
parties litigant shall (as the cause may
require) make his Plea and found his
intention on such Sentence, then the
Judge may enquire into the grounds and
merits thereof; and if he finds it is not
agreeable to the Principles of internal
Justice, and that it wants the substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials
of a Sentence requisite, not by the
positive Laws of the place, but by the
common and general Law by which (it
is supposed) the Case is to be judged,
he is to forbear putting the Sentence
into Execution, or to admit it as a Plea
untill those points be declared, wherein
he finds, or hath just cause to judge, it is
not agreeable to the Law. There is a
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64424:126"/>
great difference in this matter, betwixt
Judges of the same, and a Foreign Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory:
In the first Case, the Sentence of
the Superior is of force, by reason of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
and Subjection; and for that
Cause, <hi>Res judicata pro veritate habetur:</hi>
But in the second Case, the Sentence is
not simply took for truth; it hath only
a presumption for it. And when that
is took off by clearer evidence, it hath no
force and operation on a Foreign Judge,
who is to observe the Rules of that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
and Common Law, and to respect
the precept of the same Law; which
saies, An unjust and null Sentence is not
to be executed, or regarded, rather than
the meer Authority and Jurisdiction of
any equal Court and Judge.</p>
                  <p>Now the substance and perpetual
rights of Marriage are determined by
the Law Divine, and observed in the
Catholick Church, which hath added
some Supplement or Explications there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
All which at least, where they
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64424:126"/>
are received and practised, as they are
here in <hi>England,</hi> make the common and
general Law, to which every Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Judge there is subject, and which
he is <hi>ex officio,</hi> and by the precept of the
Law, bound to observe, even against the
consent of Parties, and the authority of
any Co-ordinate equal Judge.</p>
                  <p>The Premisses considered, since in this
Case here is a perpetual impediment ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
by <hi>Cottington, viz.</hi> That the first
Husband of <hi>Gallina</hi> was then, and is still a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live;
and since the Archbishop's Sentence
is grounded on a pretended force and fear,
not proved (for ought appears;) and if it
was, it is by the abovesaid Co-habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Issue, purged in construction of
Law; we are of Opinion that the
Judges of this Territory, ought not to
pronounce for the second Marriage, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
they shall be satisfied (if it may be)
that the Archbishop's Sentence was good
and valid.</p>

                  <head>In the Index of a Manuscript of
Collections by Sir Julius Caesar,
Fol. 277. is referr'd to under his
own hand, in which Fol. is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
as followeth. (The Book is
markt on the outside, A. A. 10.)</head>
                  <p>UPon the Treaty with <hi>Gray</hi> Lord
<hi>Chandois,</hi> it was thought meet
that 16500 <hi>l.</hi> should be alloted to the
Lady for her right, to the value of
14500 <hi>l.</hi> in Land, and 2000 <hi>l.</hi> in Money.
But in regard the whole Estate moved
from the Lady, and that Sir <hi>John</hi> was
able to give her no Advancement or
Dower out of his Estate, it was thought
meet, that the Lady should have 8000<hi>l.</hi>
at her sole dispose, and the residue to be
at their joint dispose.</p>
                  <p>After, upon motion on the Lady's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
out of a fear, that the Estate might
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:64424:127"/>
be wasted by Sir <hi>John,</hi> and thereby
she deprived of maintenance (she then
having on knowledge of the Marriage
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or hope of a Divorce, or Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the said Marriage) it was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that the same should be conveyed
over to certain Feoffees in trust to her
use; that she by her Indenture under
her Hand and Seal, solely and without
Sir <hi>John,</hi> might dispose thereof.</p>
                  <p>The which conveyance was directed
by three living of this Honourable
board, <hi>viz.</hi> The Lord <hi>Treasurer,</hi> the
Lord <hi>Privy Seal,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Stanhope;</hi>
and by the Lord <hi>Popham,</hi> Lord <hi>Tanfield,</hi>
Sir <hi>Thomas Hesketh, Serjeant Dodridge,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Stephens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Land allotted the Lady, being
sold for 7800 <hi>l,</hi> with 6500 <hi>l.</hi> thereof
<hi>Barn-Elmes</hi> was purchased; but Sir <hi>John</hi>
being trusted by the Lady to go to Mr.
<hi>Stephens</hi> to draw the conveyance, went
to other Councel; and in the clause where
it should be freely at the Lady's dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64424:128"/>
solely without Sir <hi>John,</hi> he caused to
be inserted these Words, That the Lady
should have power to convey the same,
to such intents and purposes as by the
said <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> solely and without the
said Sir <hi>John Kennedy</hi> by writing under
her Hand and Seal enrolled, should be
limitted and appointed. Wherein, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the contradictariness of the Sence,
he caused in that Deed delivered the
Lady (the more to blind her Eyes) <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled</hi>
to be razed and made <hi>indented.
Deed. 31. Decemb. 3. Jac.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And after the Rasure was found out,
then by his Deed <hi>Dat. 2. Julij, 4. Jac.</hi>
he the said Sir <hi>John</hi> did limit power to
the Lady by her Deed inrolled, or not
inrolled to limit uses.</p>
                  <p>The Lady hath been a Suiter two
years (if Sir <hi>John</hi> for saving his own
Credit will not confess matter to make a
Divorce) then that in course of Justice
she may be admitted to her proof, which
for that it concerneth matter of State (as
is suggested) she is denyed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:64424:128"/>
1. And therefore she hopeth, it is
but the same equity to stay his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
touching her Estate against her or
her Feoffees in Course of Justice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
it is not by her lachess that the
Marriage is not disproved, untill both
the said causes having a dependency one
upon another, may be handled at this
Board.</p>
                  <p>2. The course of Conveyance by
Feoffees, was by Honourable Personages,
Grave Judges, and Learned Lawyers
directed when the Lady was supposed
the true Wife of Sir <hi>John,</hi> and they held
in Law and Equity sufficient, and now
<hi>à fortiore</hi> it should be more sufficient,
she being none of his Wife, if she may
be admitted to proofs.</p>
                  <p>3. Sir <hi>John</hi> hath already advanced
himself by the Sale of the Lady's Estate,
over and above the purchace of <hi>Tonbridge</hi>
which cost 8500 <hi>l.</hi> wherein he hath a
a joint Estate of Inheritance, and all her
Debts that he hath paid, 7500 <hi>l.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:64424:129"/>
4. If the course propounded at this
Honourable Board shall not hold, then
will the Lady never assent to Sell, and
so shall the Debts of the Lady before
Marriage, now resting unpaid, being
2207 <hi>l.</hi> and Sir <hi>John</hi>'s own Debts rest
unsatisfied, to the oppression and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of many poor Men, and the King
still troubled with renewing his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                  <p>5. If Sir <hi>John</hi> should proceed in course
of Justice, and that the conveyance
made to Feoffees, should not be held
sufficient and strong enough to convey
the same to the Lady; yet Sir <hi>John</hi> can
have but the profits thereof, being but
300 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> and not that clear
which is not able to pay half the use of
the Money.</p>
                  <p>6. Besides, before any Sute began,
the said Mannor of <hi>Barn-Elms</hi> was for
valuable consideration of Money lent,
Mortgaged and now resteth forfeited for
Non-payment of 2000 <hi>l.</hi>

have no Jurisdiction, nor Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

appeal or provocation from that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.
That it was given by the Judges
of an high Court in <hi>Scotland,</hi> from
whence no Appeal lieth: And that if
the <hi>English</hi> Woman's marriage should be
pronounced void here in <hi>England,</hi> the
justice of the Realm of <hi>Scotland</hi> may
thereby seem to be taxed.</p>
                  <p>The Question is, Whether the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Judges or Judge, having Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
in the place in <hi>England,</hi> where
the said <hi>A. B.</hi> and the <hi>English</hi> Woman

                  <p>

the same must be decided by some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Judge, or Judges, who ought to

                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In all Causes where there

Whereupon it followeth, That the
Ecclesiastical Judges here in <hi>England,</hi>
who have Authority to hear causes of
Matrimony, are the competent Judges,
and have power to hear and determine
this matter of the lawfullness or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of the Lady's Marriage; and
the rather, for that the Lady's Marriage
(which is the principal matter in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
was made and solemniz'd here in
<hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it be objected, That because that
Point whereupon the Validity or Invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of the Lady <hi>Kennedy</hi>'s Marriage de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Marriage between Sir
<hi>John</hi> and <hi>Isabel Kennedy,</hi> is already ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
by a definitive Sentence long
since; from which there hath been no
appeal or provocation, and therefore it
must Barr the Lady. We answer, That
although in Causes of other Nature,
where no danger of sin might ensue,
though the Sentence were against the
truth; if a Sentence be once lawfully
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64424:134"/>
given, and not appealed from in due time,
the matter cannot be called in question a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
yet, where a Sentence is given to
dissolve or anull a lawfull Matrimony,
that Sentence may at any time, though
never so long after, be called in question
and reversed, whensoever it may be
made to appear that the truth is contrary
to that Sentence; and that may be done
even by the party himself who obtain'd
that Sentence. And therefore not only
Sir <hi>John Kennedy,</hi> but <hi>Isabel</hi> her self might
have reversed that Sentence, proving the
same was given by error; much less shall
the Lady who was not party to that
Sute, be thereby debarred from proving
the Nullity of her Marriage, being a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
cause from that. And the reason
of the difference between a Sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a Matrimony, and a Sentence in
another Cause; is, because in other
Causes, where no fear is of Sin, or peril
of Soul to ensue, the parties may by
their agreement make what end of the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64424:134"/>
Business they list, by composition or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise.
And therefore if they do not
appeal from the Sentence given against
them, they are thought by their consent
to confirm the same; but because a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
by God's Law cannot be dissolved
by the Agreement or Consent of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
no Sentence therein given against a
Marriage, contrary to the truth by er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
can by the Parties agreement be
confirmed, lest if it should be otherwise,
thereby they might by colour of the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
Sentence marry other Persons
and live in Adultery. Nay more, If the
Parties themselves thus erroneously di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced
contrary to the truth, would hold
themselves contented with the Sentence;
if either of them marry any other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or they both live incontinently with
other Persons, the Judge of that place,
where they inhabit, may and ought of
his own Office to inforce the Parties, so
by error divorced, to live together again,
as Man and Wife, and separate them
from their second Spouses.</p>

                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:64424:135"/>
If it be objected, That the Sentence
was given in another Country, where
the Judges of <hi>England</hi> have no Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and in an High-Court from
whence there lieth no Appeal; and that
the Judges of <hi>England</hi> have no Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to call their Sentences in question,
and that therefore the Lady cannot call
that Divorce in question here: We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
That the principal cause in this
case of the Lady's, is not to reverse or
call in question the Sentence given in
<hi>Scotland:</hi> but the principal Cause here is,
Whether her Marriage made in <hi>England</hi>
with Sir <hi>John,</hi> be of Validity or no? For
that (as we say) Sir <hi>John</hi> had another
Wife living, <hi>viz.</hi> (<hi>Isabel Kennedy</hi>) at the
time of her Marriage, without any
mention to be made by the Lady of any
Sentence of Divorce given in <hi>Scotland;</hi>
against which our Allegations, if Sir
<hi>John</hi> object, That he was Divorced from
her by Sentence in <hi>Scotland;</hi> this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Divorce is brought in, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidently
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64424:135"/>
by Sir <hi>John</hi> in this Cause, and
also vainly and impertinently, if it can be
proved, that the truth is contrary to that
Sentence; for that Sentence is in Law
meerly void, and cannot Barr the Lady
for the reasons before alledged, and for
that <hi>Ecclesia</hi> was <hi>decepta</hi> in giving of that
Sentence. Now when a Sentence which
is void in Law (and especially against a
Marriage) is called in question, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidently
before any Judge whatsoever,
though an inferior in a Cause which
doth principally belong unto his Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
that Judge may take knowledge
of, and incidently examine the validity
of that Sentence, whether it were good
or no, by whom and wheresoever that
Sentence was given, though he were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so Superior a Judge; not to the end
to reverse or expresly to pronounce that
Sentence to be void or not void, but as
he findeth it by examination of the Cause
to be good or void; so to give Sentence
accordingly, and determine the Cause
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64424:136"/>
principally depending before him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ever mentioning the erroneous Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
in his Sentence.</p>
                  <p>Neither can the Sentence given here
for the Nullity of the Lady's Marriage,
upon other matter than was pleaded and
proved before the Judges in <hi>Scotland;</hi>
although the same Sentence had been
principally called in question, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
pronounced to be void, any ways
impeach the Justice of <hi>Scotland;</hi> for sith
Judges, in all Courts and Causes must
judge according to that which is alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and proved before them; what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment
is it to the justice of any
Judge (although his Sentence be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked,
and a contrary Sentence given by
another Judge) when the parties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
whom the Sute is, either can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
or through negligence or collusion,
will not alledge or make such proof
before him, the first Judge as they might,
but afterwards before the second Judge,
good and sufficient proof is made; a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:64424:136"/>
matter which falleth out every day here
in <hi>England,</hi> in every Civil and Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Court, upon appeal made from
one Court to another, and the like fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out in all other Countreys; and yet
the former Judge, whose Sentence is
revers'd, thinketh not himself any whit
impeached of injustice thereby.</p>
                  <p>That the absurdities which would
ensue, may by example more plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
if the Law should not be as we
say. Put this Case: A Widower in the
confines of <hi>England</hi> towards <hi>Scotland,</hi>
marrieth a Wife in a Parish-Church
publickly, in the presence of a hundred
Witnesses, and afterwards they live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by the space of a Year, and have
a Child; at the years end, upon some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment)
they both being desirous
to be rid the one of the other,) the
Woman in <hi>England</hi> sueth her Husband
to be Divorced from him; pretending
that at such time as he married her, he
had another Wife living, and produceth
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:64424:137"/>
Witnesses which prove that he had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
another Wife before he married her,
and Paradventure make some probable
shew, that that Wife was living, when
he married his second Wife, who in
truth was dead before, as the Man could
have plainly proved by twenty Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
if he had listed; notwithstanding,
the Husband being willing to be rid of
his Wife, either would not plead that
his former Wife was dead, or else would
not make any proof thereof. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Woman obtaineth Sentence
against the Man, whereby the marriage
between them two, by this collusion
and error, is pronounced void; from
which Sentence there was no Appeal or
Provocation. Now within a Month
after this Divorce, this Man goeth into
the Confines of <hi>Scotland,</hi> not ten Miles
from the place where he and his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced
Wife formerly dwelt, and there
marrieth another Woman, being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the former Wife and collu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64424:137"/>
Divorce, and there Co-habiteth
and dwelleth with her. This Woman
shortly after, understanding of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses,
and that she could not be his
lawful Wife, but liv'd in Adultery with
him, desireth before the Judge in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
under whose jurisdiction they both
dwell, to be divorced from him, and
to be delivered from her adulterous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
with him; and offereth to prove
all the Premisses most manifestly. Were
it not now a most absurd and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
thing, that this Woman should
have no remedy any where, but be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
to live still in Adultery with this
Man; because the Sentence of divorce
was given by a Judge in <hi>England,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
the Marriage between the
Man and his second Wife to be void;
whereas it can be most manifestly and
apparently proved, that his first Wife
was dead before his second Marriage;
and so the Sentence was given against
the apparent truth? And what impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64424:138"/>
of injustice can this be to the
judge in <hi>England,</hi> before whom it was
never proved, That the Man's first Wife
was dead, to have his Sentence reversed
upon new proofs made before the Judge
in <hi>Scotland?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now between the Lady's Case and
this Case, there is no difference in truth
of matter and point of Law, only by
reason of the multitude of the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
the nearness of the time, and place
when, and where these things in this
case were done. The truth thereof
may more easily and readily be proved,
than in the Lady's cause it can; but if
the truth in her Case be proved, though
with more difficulty, the Cases are all
one.</p>
                  <p>If any Man shall yet doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this cause can be heard and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
by the Ecclesiastical Courts in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
it is desired, That Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,
considering the Marriage was made
here in <hi>England,</hi> and the Lady and Sir
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64424:138"/>
                     <hi>John</hi> do both dwell here, and by Law
Sir <hi>John</hi> is not compellable to appear in
any other place than <hi>England</hi> for this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
they would tell, before what Judge
this matter should be heard, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined?
For it is to be presumed, that
when two persons live in Adultery to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and so in continual sin, and the
one of them seeketh redress, and to be
freed from that sinfull and adulterous
life, no Man will say, That he or she
shall be compelled to live notoriously in
Adultery still, and have no Judge at all
to separate them and remedy this enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
                  <p>If further doubts be made how, where,
or in what manner proof shall be made
in this Cause; it is said, that this Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
doth not concern the Question, What
Court or before what Judges, the cause
shall be heard and determined; but to
this, it is answered, That the proofs
shall be made in such manner, as they
be ordinarily in all other Cases; that is,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64424:139"/>
by the Answers of the contrary Part
upon Oath, by such Witnesses as they
can procure voluntarily to come before
the Judges here, from whence, or out
of what Countrey soever they can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
them. If they will not come vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily,
then if they be within the juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the Judge, and the party pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducent
think so good, he shall have Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
to compell them to come before
the Judge; if they dwell so far off as
that it will be too chargable to bring
them before the Judge, then a Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
shall be granted to some Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
to examine them near the places
where they dwell, and this if they
dwell within the Judge's Jurisdiction;
but if the Witnesses dwell out of the
Judge's Jurisdiction, in any other Place,
Realm or Countrey, Then the Judge
of the Cause may direct a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
requisitory to the Judges of the
Places or Countreys where the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
dwell, to intreat them to examine
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64424:139"/>
the Witnesses remaining there by their
Authority, and to send their Depositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the Judges of the Cause, also by
the Records of other Courts; or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Instruments or Writings which may
any ways further the Cause; these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ordinary and usual courses used
for making of Proof in every Cause, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Day, and will not be denied by
any acquainted with the Proceedings in
any Ecclesiastical or Civil Courts.</p>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> 1. Whether in the <hi>Tucin</hi> Process
for the dissolution of the Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Frichinono</hi> and <hi>Gallina,</hi> there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
so manifest a Collusion, that if
the said Process comes to be examin'd
before our Court, the Sentence for the
dissolution grounded on that Process
will be declared Void?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> I am of Opinion in the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
                  <p>A Collusion, as all other Clandestine
Acts and Agreements, is accounted by
the Law to be <hi>Difficilis Probationis,</hi> and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64424:140"/>
therefore a direct Proof is not required,
but Conjectures and Presumption alone,
arising not only from what has been
done, but from what was omitted, will
pass for full and concludent Evidence,
<hi>ut per Felin. c. Praeterea n. 2. de Testibus
&amp; D. D. com omnes in c. Literis, &amp;c.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now there does not appear through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all the Acts, that the <hi>parsrea</hi> used
any diligence to defend the Cause. 'Tis
true there was the formality of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
but he seems rather to be appointed
to substantiate Proceedings on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side, than to defend the Marriage
on this; for that it appears by the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
there was nothing done on the
part of <hi>Frichinono:</hi> the words are <hi>Visis
Actis ex parte Gallinae tum distributis;</hi>
Then 'tis <hi>Gallina</hi> that is at all the expence,
though she obtains in her Suit, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
gives an ample Reward of 100
Crowns in Gold to the Court for Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials.</p>

                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:64424:140"/>
                     <hi>Frichinono,</hi> though in his Answer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Oath, he believes it to be a good
Marriage, and never knew of any such
Aversion as is alledged; yet he adds,
That if it shall be so determined, he doth
not dissent, but that the Marriage may
be declared Void; and as he doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in this instance, so neither does
he Appeal. Now by these Omissions
the Collusion appears, which Collu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
renders the Judgment Void, but
especially against a third Party, and that
it has been thus often determined in
like manner.</p>

                  <p>This was in a Civil Cause, but the

and odious too, in that it is for the

to the Persons of the Witnesses,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:64424:141"/>
and their sayings; But chiefly the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation
with all its Circumstances;
and at last, the Fear that is pretended is
but Reverential. Why, what can be

the Force and Fear, she suffered from
her Father in that Process, be not insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
in Law?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> I am of Opinion that the Proof is
insufficient.</p>
                  <p>1. For that they are but single Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
, <hi>&amp; nunquam probant etiamsi mille
jungentur;</hi> especially in <hi>Arduis,</hi> such as
are Criminal, and Causes <hi>de matrimonio
dirimendo.</hi> But more especially where
the presumption of Law is against
it; as in our Case, if we Consider the
Co-habitation with all its Circumstances.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:64424:142"/>
2. The matter deposed does not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to such a Force as the Law takes
notice of. And 'tis chiefly <hi>ex auditu,</hi>
either from her own Relation, or the
Father's or Brother's; as they heard her
say, She had no Affection, That she
would not consent, That her Father
would Force Her. <hi>Giacono Batta</hi> and
<hi>Compeggio</hi> depose no more; <hi>Rath. Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glini</hi>
and <hi>Monfort,</hi> say, He told them so,
and she too, but separate: <hi>Galliero</hi> heard
<hi>Dominico</hi> chiding and threatning, but
'twas but the Father told him, 'twas in
the Business with <hi>Frichinono.</hi> None but
<hi>Cornelius</hi> swears to Knowledge, and he
to an uncertain time. At Supper once
she told her Father, She would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
, for that she had no Affection for
him; <hi>Dominico</hi> then rose and gave her
two Blows; and when she was gone,
he said, He would strangle her if she
would not have him. This is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of all the Evidence, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
can make no concludent Proof,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:64424:142"/>
either of the Dislike, or Force or Fear;
perhaps there might words of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
fall from her, as 'tis usual among
young Women when they are Courted,
either to their Familiars or their other
Lovers; for by speaking against those
that are absent, they more oblige him
that is present.</p>
                  <p>But then there is this to be attended,
and 'tis <hi>Argumentum à verisimili</hi> Negative.
Is it probable that in Case there had
been such an Aversion as she pleads,
and such a clutter to force her Consent,
that <hi>Frichinono</hi> should never know it
before or after, either from her self or
some other? For so he does directly
swear; and yet 'tis apparent enough by
what has been said, that he did counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
the Divorce, and so seems to
swear against himself.</p>
                  <p>3. If there is any stress laid upon
that additional proof made by her
suppletory Oath, that's as weak as the
rest, for that is not admissible by Law,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64424:143"/>
especially in <hi>dirimendo matrimonio, c. Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieris
. De Testibus, &amp; gloss. ibm. D. D. Coiter

Jurejurando,</hi> especially if we consider
all the Circumstances in this Case.</p>
                  <p>4. In case the Force and Fear that is
pretended were in full Proof; yet 'tis
but Reverential, and the Force how soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it may be in other Cases which are
frequent in our Books; yet I find by
the best Authorities, that the Law is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
in case of Parents, especially
where the Children are not Minors,
that a reverential Fear cannot dissolve a
Marriage; for that 'tis not believed that
Parents would do any thing prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to their Children, <hi>Cum praesuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
Patrem recte consuluisse filiae:</hi> and the
Civil Law allows but one cause of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
<hi>L. Sed ea quae, F. Despons. Tunc au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
solum dissentiendi à Patre licentia filiae
conceditar; si indignum moribus vel turpem
sponsum ei pater eligat.</hi> There are some of
Opinion that a Reverential Fear with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64424:143"/>
Circumstances may, as if there be
<hi>Minae &amp; verbera</hi> in the Case, and that
the Parents are wont to put their threats
in Execution; and this Opinion is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Supra c. in literis De spons. impube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi>
I think a very weak Ground. The
Case: There was a Girl of 12 years old,
was espoused to a Boy of 9 or 10.
<hi>Quae de voluntate parentum potius quam sua
ad domum patris pueri adducta, ubi nolens &amp;
invita, minis parentum, impulsa moram
feeit per annum, &amp; tandem regressa est.</hi>
The Judgment was, <hi>Cùm puer nondum ad
14 Annum pervenit, nec ad eandem carnaliter
accessum habuit,</hi> she should have the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to marry with another. Now we
are within but one Circumstance of
that Case. The Woman here was near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
30 than 12: It does not appear in
Proof, nor is offered, that she was Forc'd
by threats to continue at <hi>Frichinono</hi>'s
House; it is clear, that <hi>Frichinono</hi> was
nearer 40 than 14, and that 'tis very
probable he had the carnal knowledge
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:64424:144"/>
of her, for she had a Child, which with
the voluntary Co-habition for near 2
Years, with liberty of going whither
she pleased, together with what is in
proof by her own Witnesses, of her Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits
to Persons of Quality, and <hi>Frichino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>'s
Absence in <hi>France</hi> for about half a
Year, and no protestation before or
after. <hi>Bellus Consil.</hi> 65. is clear in this
very Case.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 3. Supposing the said Marriage were
really made through Force and Fear,
yet being ratified by a Co-habitation of
almost 2 Years, and issue, whether
the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> does Authorize its
dissolution?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> I am of Opinion in the Negative,
for that the Council has prescribed a
Probatory Form for Marriage, enacting,
That all Marriages shall be void that are
not celebrated in the Presence of the
<hi>Parochus</hi> and 2 Witnesses. Now some
are of Opinion that the old Law is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by this, not only in the Addition
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:64424:144"/>
of the <hi>Parochus,</hi> but in a far greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
, collecting from hence, that a contract,
so celebrated, but being void by reason of
Force, though it were ratified by a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
Co-habitation with issue, which
might purge the Force by a tacit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
yet because it was not <hi>de novo,</hi>
in the form of the Council celebrated
before the <hi>Parochus,</hi> and two
Witnesses as it was at first,<note place="margin">Tom. 1. part. 2. c. 3. <hi>§.</hi> 6. Cons. 170. l. 4.</note> it
cannot pass into a substantial
Marriage. But I do conceive
this inference cannot be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
out of the Council.</p>
                  <p>1. Because I do not find it asserted
by any modern Authorities, such as
have wrote since the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi>
who otherwise are tenacious enough of
the Decrees of that Council; such as
<hi>Covaruvias, Parisius, Christinaeus</hi> and
<hi>Bellus,</hi> (who was Prothonotory of the
Apostolick Sea, and Dean of the Roe
of <hi>Avignion, Anno</hi> 1620.) but that they
all agree, that a subsequent Co-habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:64424:145"/>
where the cause of Fear does not
remain, induces a Tacit Consent and
establishes a Marriage, which might
otherwise have been void. Now if
the form of the Council had been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
a second time, these could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have been silent in it.</p>
                  <p>2. Because the Council does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
command it in this Case, and
then the vulgar Rule is, <hi>Quod à jure ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri
recedere non debemus, nisi quatenus jus
vetus expressim est correctum.</hi> Neither is
there a parity of Reason with the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponsatione
Impuberum,</hi> which was adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>decis. noviss. part. 4. f.</hi> 69. for those
are but <hi>sponsalia de futuro,</hi> though the
words are <hi>de praesenti.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Reason suggests otherwise. 'Tis
certain that Consent is an act of the
Will, and does consist in the Mind,
and can appear to us to be voluntary,
by no other means than as Force and
Fear is proved, and that by conjectures;
now these conjectures must be collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:64424:145"/>
either from Words or Acts, such as
may signifie and give a moral certainty
of the internal willingness of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
perhaps more than Words; for so
it was adjudged of him that said he
would not do the Will of his Father,
but yet did it; if therefore the subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Acts be of the like Nature, and
pursuant to the principal, we always
judge that they have respect to it as the
Original, and serve to Expound and
Confirm it, <hi>nam ratihabitio retrotrahitur
&amp; mandato aequiparatur.</hi> Now 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in this very Case, here was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of <hi>Gallina</hi> solemnly exprest in the
Form of the Council; whether 'twas vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
and really her Mind or no, God
and her own Conscience only can tell;
but there does not appear any thing in
Proof, to the contrary at the time of the
Marriage.</p>
                  <p>And therefore admit, that before and
after the Solemnity, she might say that
her consent was not free, yet she did not
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:64424:146"/>
say so at the time. And in Truth and
Reality, notwithstanding these common.
Pretences, it might then be free; and
Law and Reason presume it was so,
from those subsequent Acts that were in
pursuance of it, such as was the Co-ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
in this Case with all its Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances;
for those subsequent Acts do
not create a new Marriage instead of
that which was Null and Void for want
of free consent; but ratifie only and
confirm the first, or rather give us an
assurance and demonstration that that
was a free internal consent, which was
exprest in the Form of the Council;
notwithstanding those specious Pretences
to the contrary, whereby she would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
upon us, and according to which we
(that can see no further than outwardly)
ought to have judged, in Case there
had not been these subsequent Acts;
and therefore undoubtedly there needs
not a second Celebration in the Form
of the Council, when by th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>se Acts
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:64424:146"/>
we are assured that she gave her free
consent in the First. <hi>Ex coitu matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium

God?</p>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> 5. Supposing the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>
does authorise its dissolution, and that
it does not act contrary to the Law of
God therein; whether according to the
due and usual proceeding of our Courts
and the Laws of our Nation, where the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64424:147"/>
Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was never received,
we shall, or ought to allow of such a
proceeding upon the account of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
of Rights, or any other account
whatsoever?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> I am of Opinion in the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
                  <p>For however it may be in Civil Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in point of Commerce or the like;
the Reason is not the same in Criminal
or Matrimonial, <hi>ubi vertitur periculum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimae,</hi>
which may arise from the difference
in Laws and Religions; for 'twould be
strange Doctrine to assert, That a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of <hi>England</hi> ought to be executed
here upon a Sentence of Heresie in <hi>Rome;</hi>
and as strange to adjudge the dissolution
of a Marriage here, because it was not
celebrated according to the form of the
Council of <hi>Trent:</hi> or rather as this Case
is, To force a Subject of <hi>England</hi> to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit

of the Laws in <hi>England,</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:64424:147"/>
Man's Wife; for that is done by
putting in Execution here a Sentence
of Divorce, which was given at <hi>Turin</hi>
upon the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> (which
Council was never promulgated in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>)
and when the Law is in Terms
otherwise, <hi>Hipol. de Morsil. singular.</hi> 138.

               <head>THE
CASE
OF THE

               <p>TO this Question in short I say,
1. That in Scripture<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 2. 28, 29.</note>
we meet with a <hi>Jew</hi> in a
Double Notion.

For so every true Christian is (in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture)
called a <hi>Jew. Rev. 3. 9. &amp;

               <p>3. For the Second Sort of <hi>Jews

               </p>
               <p>Now the Question is only of a <hi>Jew</hi>
in Religion (of what Nation soever)
or of him who is a <hi>Jew, Natione &amp;
Religione simul.</hi> Whether such may be
admitted in a Christian Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth?</p>
               <p>In Answer to this Question, I say,
That the Toleration or Admission of
such <hi>Jews</hi> may be considered in a
Twofold Relation.
<list>
                     <item>1. Respectu Reipub.</item>
                     <item>2. Respectu Ecclesiae.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:64424:150"/>
1. In Respect of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
there are only Two Things
properly considerable to a Statesman,
which may make their Toleration or
Admission Legal or Illegal, Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
or Inconvenient, according to the
Nature and Condition of those Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Considerations.</p>
               <p>Now these Considerations are,</p>
               <p>1. Whether there be any Law of
the State against such <hi>Jews</hi> being here:
for if there be, then <hi>stante Lege,</hi> they
cannot legally be admitted. And
in <hi>England</hi> there is
such a<note n="a" place="margin">Statut. de Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daismo. Termino Hilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii. An. 18. Edvardi 1. <hi>And they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd</hi> An. 1291. Th. Stubbs. de Pontif. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bora. censib. in Joh. Romano.</note> Law; but
that Law taken away
(and as the Supreme
Power made it for
good Reasons (as they
conceited) then, so the
Supreme Power may (possibly for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Reasons) alter it now; the State
may readmit them <hi>Lege non obstante.</hi>
So that if the Supream Power abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64424:151"/>
that Law, then tis manifest there
is no Legal Impediment (as to the
Civil Law of this Nation) but that
they may (if it seem good to the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the State) be readmited<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>The Second Consideration (as to
the Political Part of this Question) is
the Damage or Benefit, the Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
or Inconveniences which may
accrue to the State by their Admissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Rejection.</p>
               <p>Now as to this I shall add,</p>
               <p>1. That seeing the Law of Nature
and Nations tell us,<note place="margin">Cicero de legib. Lib. 1.</note> that
<hi>Salus Populi suprema
Lex est,</hi> if it appear to
his Highness and his Council (who
only are Judges of this and not the
People) that the Common-weal will
be advantaged by their Admission,
then (no doubt) they may and ought
to be admitted.</p>
               <p>2. If otherwise, they are not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:64424:151"/>
Now whether it be for the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
and Secular Advantage of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
to admit the <hi>Jews,</hi> I shall
not Dispute, but leave it to the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the State, only I shall observe
here Two Things.</p>
               <p>1. That whilst the <hi>Jews</hi> lived in
<hi>England</hi> it was a vast Benefit to the
Crown. I shall give one Instance ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by my Lord<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>My Lord</hi> Cooke <hi>Institut.</hi> part. 2. pag. 506. De Statuto Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daismi.</note>

               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:64424:152"/>
2. It appears by our Story that the
<hi>Jews</hi> (at their Expulsion, and many
times before) were not
only<note n="a" place="margin">

but Inhumanely and
Barbarously used; and
then seeing Common-wealths

never die (though par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

whether the Common-wealth of

for the<note n="b" place="margin">And as in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> so elsewhere the <hi>Jews</hi> (though bad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough) were falsly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused, and upon that Banished. <hi>Vt eorum bona fisco vindicaren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> So they were expell'd out of <hi>Spain</hi> by <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and <hi>Emanuel</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> out of <hi>France</hi> by <hi>Dagobert</hi> and <hi>Philip the Long.

same Common-wealth
did to their Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
then?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:64424:152"/>
                  <hi>Dub.</hi> The main Objection against
them, why they were banished, was
their Usury, and the Mischief that
came thereupon, as appears by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble
of the<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Statutum de Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daismo Term. Hillarii 18. Ed.</hi> 1.</note> Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
by which they
were banished.</p>
               <p>To this I say, these things,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. That Usury is tollerated in
all Christian Common-weals (even
in ours) and therefore to expel <hi>Jews</hi>
for that which is tollerated in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
is irrational.</p>
               <p>2. The State may limit their <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
usurae,</hi> not to exceed that allow'd
by Statutes, and then no more Fault
in them, then us.</p>
               <p>3. If you consider the Tolleration
and Readmission of the <hi>Jews, respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctu
Ecclesiae,</hi> there are only Three
things which may rationally hinder a
Toleration and Readmission of them,
into a Christian Common-wealth, as
Christian.</p>

               </list>
               <p>1. <hi>Inhonestum.</hi> I conceive, that
for <hi>Jews</hi> to live among Christians, or
Christians amongst <hi>Jews</hi> is not <hi>Inho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestum,</hi>
or <hi>Malum per se,</hi> as being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
no Law of God, natural or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive,
either that of Nature or Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
Because,</p>
               <p>1. Our Saviour and his Apostles
after him, lived amongst <hi>Jews</hi> uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
which they would not have
done had it been unlawful.</p>
               <p>2. The Apostles and primitive
Christians lived amongst <hi>Pagan</hi> Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,
who were far worse than <hi>Jews,</hi>
yet made no Scruple of Conscience,
nay the Apostles approving it: For
the Apostle commands the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to live so, that they might gain the
<hi>Pagans</hi> to the Faith by their Pious
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64424:153"/>
and Christian<note n="a" place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 12.</note> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation:
and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they supposed
they might live amongst them; for
it were not Sense to suppose, that they
could gain those by their Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with whom they might not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.</p>
               <p>3. It is certain and an undoubted
Principle, That <hi>Domium non fundatur
in gratiâ,</hi> and therefore a <hi>Jew,</hi> nay a
<hi>Turk,</hi> or <hi>Pagan</hi> hath a just Right and

proposed (which might render the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission

was the <hi>Incommodum,</hi> the
Harm or Disadvantages which might
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64424:155"/>
come to Christianity or Christians by
their company and conversation: For
if indeed the admission, and tollerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them were disadvantageous to
the Gospel, and really tended to the
abolition or diminution of the true
Faith, or the subversion and hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Christianity, it were certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
neither pious in the supreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
nor prudent to admit them; but
he ought (in this case) rather to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
them if they were here, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admit
them, now they are away: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he is, <hi>Non solùm Reipublicae, sed &amp;

But on the other side, if the civil
State may be advantaged by their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
and the Church secured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
such pretended Danger, then
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64424:155"/>
(<hi>ex hoc capite</hi>) there is no Reason but
they may be admitted.</p>
               <p>And that there is no such Danger
which might rationally hinder their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
I am induced to believe,</p>
               <p>1. Because, if there had been any
such Danger, the Apostles would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
(which yet they
<note n="†" place="margin">As above, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1. &amp; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 12.</note>did) have permitted

the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It hath been the constant and

not find any considerable number of

the senceless irrationality of their

the <hi>Odium</hi> that lies upon them univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally

Will of those Princes and States in
whose Territories they live; and so
want all those temporal advantages,
which might allure Proselytes, having
no Jurisdiction or Authority any
where to Protect themselves, much
less others who shall desert their own
Profession to embrace theirs: So that
in all likelihood (considering the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of Truth, and the very many
Advantages which the Professors of
Christianity have above that of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daism
) by the Readmission of the
Jews, the cohabitation and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
amongst Christians, they may
be sooner converted to Christianity,
(God blessing the means) than Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
seduced into Judaism.</p>

with the Jews now, if they should be

State may by the Capitulations of their
Admission, tye them to the contrary,
and make such Seduction (if volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily

for their Priviledges, and so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure

               <p>3. <hi>Scandalum.</hi> For the third thing
which might make the admission of
the Jews unlawful, to wit, <hi>Scandal;</hi>
I conceive the case will be more plain
than the former: For though I know
not what Scandal some may take
(who are hardly pleased with any
thing the Publick Magistrates do,
which suits not with their ends and
interest) yet I do not see any colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Reason; why the Readmission of
the Jews into this Nation, should by
any sober and intelligent Person, be
thought Scandalous, (<hi>Scandalum da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:64424:159"/>
I mean) or be a ground of just
Offence to any.</p>
               <p>And that this may appear, I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
thus, If the supreme Magistrate
by readmiting the Jews, give a just
ground of Scandal, then it is either to
Foreign States abroad, or their own
Subjects at home, but neither of both
can rationally be said.</p>
               <p>1. Not to Foreign States abroad,
for there neither is, nor hardly ever
was any Kingdom or State in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom
, which sometime or other
hath not admitted them: Sure I am
most do now, and certainly such States
have no just Reason (nor can have)
to condemn us, for that which they
do themselves.</p>
               <p>2. Not to their own Subjects at
home; and that this may more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
appear, I consider</p>
               <p>1. That in relation to humane
actions to be done, or not to be done
by us, all things in the World are,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64424:159"/>
and (of necessity) must be ranked in
one of these three Particulars;</p>
               <p>1. Some things are absolutely
good.</p>
               <p>2. Some are absolutely bad.</p>
               <p>3. Some are <hi>Res mediae,</hi> and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
.</p>
               <p>1. Things absolutely good are such,
as are <hi>Sub praecepto divino affirmativo,</hi>
(<hi>naturali vel positivo</hi>) and these of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
(<hi>necessitas praecepti</hi>) is meant, must
be done, and without sin cannot be
left undone by any Man in the World,
(no one rational <hi>individuum</hi> excepted;
For I speak not of Children or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Fools who want the use of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
) if they be <hi>juris naturalis:</hi> nor if
they be <hi>juris positivi,</hi> can they (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sin) be left undone by any Man
to whom that positive divine Law is
sufficiently reveal'd. Now I take it
for manifest, and a truth (which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve)
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64424:160"/>
will be granted by all sober
Men; that neither the admission or
exclusion of the Jews is absolutely
good, or <hi>sub praecepto divino affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivo</hi>
(<hi>naturali vel positivo.</hi>) For</p>
               <p>1. If their admission were a thing
absolutely good, and <hi>sub praecepto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino
,</hi> then all those who admit them
not (and much more they who eject
them) would be found guilty of a
manifest violation of the Law of God,
which no Man ever said, nor with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
congruity of Reason can say.</p>
               <p>2. If their exclusion were absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
good and <hi>sub praecepto divino,</hi> then
all those who have admitted them (and
the Christian Churches in all ages, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
those of the Apostles themselves
have done so) will be found guilty of
a great sin, and manifest transgression
of the Law of God, and then the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Christians, and the Apostles
themselves must of necessity be guilty
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64424:160"/>
of this Crime, which neither is, nor
can justly be affirmed.</p>
               <p>2. Things absolutely bad are such
as are <hi>sub praecepto Dei negativo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rali
vel positivo,</hi> forbidden by God, and
and so absolutely unlawful for us; and
that the admission of the Jews into
this, or any other Christian Common-wealth
should be thus unlawful, and
so <hi>malum per se,</hi> I believe is not, and
I am sure cannot with any congruity
be asserted.</p>
               <p>1. Because there appears no Law
of God (natural or positive) against
such admission, he that thinks other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
let him shew it.</p>
               <p>2. If admission of the Jews into a
Christian Common-wealth, if cohabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and an outward and civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
with them, had been an evil
of this high nature; then, as is before
said, the primitive Christians and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
nay our blessed Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
which is impious to think, had
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64424:161"/>
been guilty of it; who all their lives
permitted, and practise such communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and outward conversation with the
unconverted Jews.</p>
               <p>3. Well then, let the admission and
exclusion of the Jews be (as most
(manifestly they are) amongst the
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>Res mediae,</hi> those things
we call indifferent, and in themselves
neither morally good or bad, but such
as may be either, according as they
are cloathed with several circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
Then I say if the supreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
(who is trusted with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
of publick affairs) think it fit
to admit the Jews into this Common-weal
(and of the conveniences and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
of their admission, he
only (and not the People) is to judge)
and by a Law authorize their admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
then (as to the Subjects) their
admission is no more a thing of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency,
but necessity: No more mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Offence or Scandal, but Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64424:161"/>
such as we who are Subjects,
should not dispute, but obey. So
that if any Man take offence, or be
scandalized at it, it will certainly be
<hi>Scandalum acceptum non datum.</hi> And
so not the fault of the Magistrate but
of the Men (if there be any such) who
are irrationally offended. And this
will manifestly appear, if we consider,</p>
               <p>1. The Magistrate in reference to
the People under him.</p>
               <p>2. The People in reference to the
Magistrate, and in reference one to
another.</p>
               <p>1. For the Magistrate, as he stands
in Relation to the People, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
(by virtue of that supreme au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
with which he is entrusted)
he is to judge what things are conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
or inconvenient for the People.</p>
               <p>2 When after serious Debate and
mature Deliberation, (all circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64424:162"/>
considered) he shall really think
and judge that this, (which before was
indifferent and no way enjoyned) is
<hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> best for the publick good,
then he justly may (by his legislative
Power) enjoyn the doing of it, and
by a positive Law bring a just Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
upon the Subjects to do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
               <p>3. Nor is this all, he not only may,
but is bound, and (if he will do
his Duty) must do so, and that by the
Law of Nature, and from the very
first Principles of his Duty, and that
Magistracy he is intrusted with, for it
being certain, that <hi>Salus Populi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prema
Lex est,</hi> and by his great and
sacred Office, an Obligation lies upon
him (by all honourable and honest
means) to procure their good, so far
as in him lies: if he see such things,
(though at present indifferent) would
much conduce to the Publick Good,
if they were enjoyned, and obey'd
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64424:162"/>
accordingly. I say, in this case, if he
do not command them, he neglects
his Duty, and violates that sacred Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
which binds him to it: So in
this present case, if (all things ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely
considered) he impartially
judge the readmission of the Jews will
really and indeed tend to the good of
the Publick, he is bound to readmit
them, and he should be wanting to
his Duty in promoting the Interest
and Good of the Common-weal, if
he should do otherwise.</p>
               <p>4. Nor is it possible that any Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
or Offence taken by the People,
should be of that moment as to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him. And the Reason of this is
manifest, because the Obligation of
doing his Duty, and procuring the
Peoples Good, lies so indispensably
upon him, that he must not omit it,
though they be never so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased,
seeing (if it must be so that
one party will be displeased) it is far
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64424:163"/>
more rational to hazard the Peoples,
than Gods Displeasure: For if he do
it, and the People be scandalized and
offended at it, that Scandal is only
<hi>Scandalum acceptum,</hi> groundless, and
(on his part) altogether causless. But
if he neglect his Duty and do it not,
God is really and justly offended. So
that in short, (if after all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered)
the Wisdom of the State shall
judge it convenient and beneficial for
the Publick to readmit the Jews, (and
we are bound in Charity to think that
unless they judge so they will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them) then they are in Duty
bound to do it, notwithstanding any
Displeasure (or pretended Scandal)
which their Subjects will or can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
against them for so doing: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
evident that no supreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
is to neglect the doing of his
Duty, or using his just and lawful
Liberty and Authority in putting that
in Execution, which upon impartial
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64424:163"/>
judgment and deliberation, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
convenient for the good of the
Common-wealth. It is I (confess) to
be wished, and heartily prayed for,
that all Men would (with a charitable
Opinion and obsequious Obedience)
rest satisfied with the deliberate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions
and constitutions of their
Magistrates really intended for the
publick Good; and (no doubt) all so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and moderate Persons will do so.
But this is rather to be wished than
hoped for. The understandings, aimes,
and interest of Men being so differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
that supreme Governours in no
Age or Country did ever satisfie all,
no not with their best Actions, and
therefore it is not to be expected now.
But this pretended Scandal and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfaction
of some, should (in reason)
be no <hi>Remora</hi> or Hinderance to the
Magistrate to go on, and according
to his best Skill and Judgment, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the Good of all. And if this
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64424:164"/>
be not admitted, it will unhinge and
enervate all Governments whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
For the Command of no King
ever pleased all his Subjects, of no Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
all his Souldiers, of no Fatherof a
Family all his Children and Servants, of
no Schoolmaster all his Scholars: and
yet this never did (or indeed should)
hinder any King, or General, or Father,
or Master to give Commands, such as
in prudence they thought convenient,
and being given, to put them in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.
The truth is, it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for any Government to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
if supreme Magistrates should
make no Law, or civil Sanction, till
all their Subjects were satisfied.</p>
               <p>5. And as evident Reasons may,
(in this Case of readmitting the Jews)
be drawn for the Liberty, which (by
the Law of Nature and Scripture) is
inherent in the supreme Magistrate's,
and his just Authority to determine
of indifferent things, to prove that he
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64424:164"/>
gives no Scandal in case he use that
Liberty and Authority in readmitting,
and giving Priviledges, (such as in
prodence he shall think fit) to the
Jews: So there may be further Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
(drawn for the same purpose) from
the consideration of the Subjects in
relation to the supreme Magistrate.
For as they stand in this Relation,
there lies an Obligation upon them,
by the Law of God and Nature, to
yield cheerful and willing Obedience
to all the just Commands of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
(as this undoubtedly is) and
then where Obedience is morally
due, Offence and Scandal is in vain
pretended. It is irrational and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
too to pretend Scandal for the
neglect of my Duty, and so evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
disobey God, and my Governours,
upon pretence, I am afraid so to do.
But enough (if not too much) of this.

of the World, by whom Kings reign,
who communicates his Power and

some of that Power he hath communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to his Apostles and Ministers,
who are his Ambassadors, Pastors of
his People, and Stewards of his Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Subjectum in quo,</hi> the civil Power

               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:64424:166"/>
This premised, I say, That the Jews
neither desiring, nor intending to be
Members of our Church, but only
of our Common-weal; their Admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
or Exclusion depends only on the
Civil Power. For the Command of
the Common-weal (as it is a civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety)
being solely in the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
to him only it will belong to
judge whether it be fit to admit or
exclude them, and to do accordingly.
'Tis true the Kingdom of Christ (his
Church) is not a Temporal but a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Society, which he rules inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by his Spirit, outwardly by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
(Bishops, or Presbiters, or
Pastors, call them what you will)
who are his Ambassadours and Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
who have a Law to rule by the
Gospel of Jesus Christ. To these he
hath committed the Keys of his House
and Kingdom, so that they (and they
only) can admit Men into it by <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism,</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:64424:167"/>
and exclude by <hi>Excomunication.</hi>
The end and use of a Key, being to
open and shut, and these Keys com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to them, they only have the
use of them, and according to the
best of their Skill, are to use them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.
On which Principles it
follows, that the Jews neither being
Christians, nor (for ought appears) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to be, their Admission or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
no way belongs to the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Governours of the Church; their
sacred Jurisdiction being only over
the Houshold of Faith (the Christian
Church) of which the Jews are no
part, and therefore not under that
Jurisdiction. So that I doubt not but
the Admission or Nonadmission of the
Jews belongs only to the Civil, not
Sacred Power.</p>
               <p>2. The Second Query is, In what
things they are to be tolerated? And
to this I say,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:64424:167"/>
1. That there is an <hi>Antithesis</hi> and
Opposition between <hi>Approbation</hi> and
<hi>Toleration</hi> of any thing; so that (in
propriety of Speech) we <hi>approve good,
tolerate bad things.</hi> And then when
the Question is about the Toleration
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> we suppose that there
is some evil in them, which for some
Reasons, some Ends and Purposes is
to be tolerated in our Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weal.</p>
               <p>2. That evils may be of two sorts,
1. Such as are against the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
2. Such as are against positive
Law; that we usually call <hi>the Law
of Nature,</hi> this the <hi>Law of Scripture,</hi>
both Divine. For in this Case the
humane Laws come not in Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration:
For if it please the supreme
Magistrate, to admit them by a Law,
then all humane Laws of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weal
(if there be any against
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64424:168"/>
them) are <hi>ipso facto</hi> null, and abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
And so their Admission (the
will of the State legally declared for
it, being supposed) cannot possibly be
against any positive Law of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weal.</p>
               <p>2. Now then for the first sort of
evils, such as are against the Law of
Nature, and are <hi>intrinsecè &amp; ex natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rà
suàmala,</hi> these no Magistrate may
tolerate. The Obligation of the Law
of Nature is so inviolable, that God
himself in all the Old Testament ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
gave any<note n="a" place="margin">Vide Grotium de Jure Belli. lib. 1. cap. 1. 5. 10. &amp;c. Suarez Aquinatem. Pet. a sancto Joseph. &amp;c. De legibus.</note> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
of that Law,
nor<note n="b" place="margin">Vide Grotium ubi supra §. 17. p. 9. ubi contrarium non si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne errore asserere vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det?</note> Toleration of
any sins against it,
much less can the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Magistrate who is
but his Vicegerent and
Deputy; and neither
hath (nor can have)
any Commission to do more than his
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64424:168"/>
great Lord and Master. 'Tis true,
the Magistrate is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Gods
Minister and Vice-gerent, and so <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stos

Sword of Justice, which he must not
bear in vain, but is bound by his place,
and that sacred calling
he carries to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note>a Revenger of
such Sins, and a Punisher of Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
against the Law of Nature.</p>
               <p>And that we may apply this <hi>in Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesi,</hi>
to our particular Case of the
Readmission of the <hi>Jews,</hi> I say,</p>
               <p>1. That in the<note n="a" place="margin">Vide Hug. Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium de Jure Belli. lib. 1. cap. 1. §. 17.</note>
Law of <hi>Moses</hi> and the
whole old Testament,
there is nothing contained to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
or repugnant to the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:64424:169"/>
2. That this Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and
the old Testament, is (or at least should
be) the adequate rule of the Jews Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
and therefore so long as they
keep to this, there is no thing in their
Religion which is intollerable on this
Account, as being against the Law of
Nature.</p>
               <p>3. But if there be any thing in
their Religion (as now they profess it)
superinduced by Error or Custom,
which is indeed against <hi>Jus naturale,</hi>
that should not be tolerated in this,
or any Christian Common-wealth.
And if the Christian Magistrate tye
them to abstain from all Idolatry,
Blasphemy, Murther, Adultery, and
all such other Sins against the Light
and Law of Nature, he tyes them to
no more, then they (in their flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
State of their Common-weal) ty'd
others. For though they did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64424:169"/>
of their Proselytes (those of the
Gate I mean) to submit to the posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Law, and Precepts
of<note n="a" place="margin">Videsis Joh. Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den de Jure naturali &amp; Gentium apud He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braeos. lib. 2. cap. 2. pag. 138, 139. &amp; ex R. Mose Maimoinde &amp; R. Mos. Mikotzi.</note> 
                  <hi>Moses,</hi> yet they
did universally require
of them to abstain
from Blasphemy, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
and all natural
Injustice, as is manifest in <hi>Josephus,</hi>
the Sacred Text it self and their Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binical
and Talmutical Writers. So
that if Christian Magistrates do (as
indeed they should) denie any Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of such unnatural Enormities,
they have Reason to rest satisfied with
it, seeing no more is denied to them
in ours, than they denied to others in
their Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dub.</hi> But it must be said, <hi>Vsury,
Boligamy,</hi> and the <hi>Marriage of a Sister,</hi>
was (by the Law of <hi>Moses</hi>) permitted
to them, and therefore the Practicers
of some things against the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:64424:170"/>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> To this I say, 1. That 'tis true,
that <hi>Aristotle</hi> and divers other Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
conceived Usury to be against the
Law of Nature; and many Divines of
eminent Note have thought (and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
their Opinions to the World)
That both <hi>Vsury</hi> and <hi>Poligamy</hi> and
<hi>marrying a Sister,</hi> are
so too.<note n="a" place="margin">Vid. Aquinat. Quaest. 94. Art. 5. Commentat. ibid. Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quez. in 1. 2. Disp. 150. Fran. Suarez. de Legibus. lib. 2. c. 5, 6. &amp;c. Fran.

I conceive to be a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
Mistake, for it
will evidently and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably
follow, God
permitted <hi>Vsury</hi> and
<hi>Polygamy</hi> and <hi>marrying
a Sister</hi> to the <hi>Jews</hi> by
a positive Law, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
neither of them is, or can be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Law of Nature, it being a
demonstrative Truth, and generally
confessed by the best Lawyers, School-men
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64424:170"/>
and Casuists, That
God<note n="a" place="margin">Vid. Petrum a Sancto Joseph. in Idea Theologiae moralis. Lib. 1. De Legibus. Cap. 2. Resolu. 4. Pag. 14.</note> never did, nor
(<hi>manente naturâ huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nâeadem</hi>) could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
with the Law of
Nature. So that I think that Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of<note n="b" place="margin">Grotius de Jure Belli. lib. 1. cap. 1. §. 17. pag. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Grotius,</hi>
(and many before him)
to be a certain Truth,
<hi>That nothing was permitted to the</hi> Jews
<hi>in the Old Testament, which was against
the Law of Nature;</hi> nor should any
such Sins be tolerated now.</p>
               <p>2. The Second sort of Sins are, such
as are against some positive Law of
God, and of such the <hi>Jews</hi> must needs
be guilty (I mean such of them, (and
only such) to whom the Gospel has
been sufficiently reveal'd) as denying
the blessed Trinity, and the whole
Gospel of Jesus Christ, That I may
not be mistaken in this Assertion, I
say,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:64424:171"/>
1. That sufficient Promulgation, is
absolutely necessary to the Obligation
of any positive Law of God, or Man,
Humane or Divine, it being morally
impossible that any Man should be
bound to obey the Laws of any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
till it be sufficiently evidenced
to him that indeed they are the Laws
of such Authority.</p>
               <p>2. If then there be any <hi>Jews</hi> in any
part of the World (as I doubt not
but there may be many) to whom the
Gospel (or any part of it) is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
revealed, then I dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
them innocently ignorant of
all, or so much of the Gospel as hath
not been sufficiently discovered to
them, and Christians guilty, who have
taken no more Care and Pains to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
that Truth to others, of which
they were abundantly convinced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
And upon this ground I think
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64424:171"/>
that there lies a sacred and heavy Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
upon Christians (as being
bound to seek the Glory of God, the
Propagation of the Gospel, and the
Conversion and Salvation of their
Brethren) to endeavour the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which certainly can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be by banishing them from all
Christian Common-wealths. And
therefore they must either go to the
<hi>Jews,</hi> or bring the <hi>Jews</hi> to them, that
so they may win them to Christ by
the Innocence of their Lives, and the
Truth and Evidence of their Doctrine.
Now these two are both one (as to
our present Case and Purpose) for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
if it be lawful for us to go, and
live amongst the <hi>Jews</hi> to Preach the
Gospel, then it will be as lawful to
bring them hither, and let them live
amongst us to the same Purpose. And
so the bringing in of the <hi>Jews</hi> will
not be so irrational a thing as some
phansie (for 'tis no more) very strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64424:172"/>
and would make the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
their Readmission to be guilty
of (I know not what) Iniquity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dub.</hi> But it may (and may be will) be
said, That the whole Gospel was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
promulgated by our Saviour
and his Apostles, that their Preaching,
and innocent Life and prodigious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
done in Confirmation of it, and
the Obsignation of it by our blessed
Saviours Death and Resurrection were
Evidences enough, that it was a divine
Law, and therefore obligatory, both
to them that heard it, and their Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
so that it needed no more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation,
but is still obligatory by the
Force of the First: as <hi>Moses</hi> his Law
being once miraculously promulged in
Mount <hi>Sina,</hi> brought an Obligation
on those that heard it and all their
Posterity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:64424:172"/>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> To this I say, that 'tis a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
and certain Truth, That the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
of the Gospel by our Saviour,
and his Apostles, was a Promulgation
of it abundantly sufficient <hi>to all those
who heard and saw those divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
their Preaching and Miracles,</hi> I
say personally to them and properly,
&amp; <hi>per se,</hi> to none else unless <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
(as
the Greek Scholia tell us) by the
Tradition, and constant and faithful
Testimony of those Eye-witnesses it
had been carefully delivered down to
Posterity. For suppose (which is not
impossible) that all those who heard
our Saviour's and his Apostles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and saw their Miracles, had
concealed them from their Posterity,
so that they had never heard any
thing of them, Then I say their
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and Descendents (who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
heard the Doctrine, nor person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
saw the Miracles, nor had them
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64424:173"/>
any way delivered to them by the
Tradition or Testimony of their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers)
were no way obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
any Gospel-Law, as never ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any such Law sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulged,
and made known unto them,
without which it was impossible they
should know those Laws<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by
consequent, impossible they should be
obliged by them. So that it is not
the first miraculous Promulgation of
the Gospel, which does <hi>per se,</hi> and
of its own Nature oblige us to Faith,
and Evangelical Obedience, but the
Continuation of it down to us, by
the Tradition and constant concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and faithful Testimony of those
that were Eye-witnesses, and those
that followed them. And if through
the impiety or negligence of this (or
any other) Age, this Continuation of
the First Promulgation should cease,
then the Obligation to believe the
Gospel would cease also (as to our
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64424:173"/>
Posterity) unless it ceased by their
Fault, or were otherwise made suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
known unto them. Whence
also it follows, that the Sin and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
of those <hi>Jews</hi> who saw Christ's
Miracles is far greater (as being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
such demonstrative Evidences
of Truth) then the Infidelity of the
present <hi>Jews</hi> whose Evidences for
Conviction (though enough) are
much lesser, and by Consequent
their Infidelity not so great. And
hence it further follows evidently
enough, that seeing the Apostles
themselves held Correspondence, and
had Communion and civil Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with those <hi>Jews</hi> whose Obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Infidelity was far greater (as
standing in Contradiction to all those
miraculous Works and divine Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
of Evangelical Truth) cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
we may have our Conversation
and civil Communion amongst those
<hi>Jews</hi> whose Obstinacy and Infidelity
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64424:174"/>
(though great enough) is far less.
And then it will be manifest that their
Readmission into our Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
(with those bounds and
limitations which we believe and hope
the Piety and Prudence of the State
will put upon them) is not in it self
unlawful <hi>Quod er at dicendum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have stood the longer upon this
Discourse, because I believe, that from
these and such like Principles, an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and fundamental Reason may be
given, why Sinners against the Law
of Scripture and positive Evangelical
Sanctions may be tollerated in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Common-wealth; when Sinners
against the Law of Nature are not,
nor indeed can be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quaere.</hi> Let the Query then be
this; Why may a Christian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
tolerate Sins and Sinners against
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64424:174"/>
the positive Law of the Gospel, and
not against the Law of Nature?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> In answer to which Query I
shall crave leave to say Two Things.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>De facto,</hi> That it ever hath
been so, in all Ages of the Church
all Christian Kings and Common-weales
(at least of which we have
any story left) giving Toleration to
the <hi>Jews,</hi> notwithstanding their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity,
and Non-submission to the
Gospel: and yet never tolerated
them (or any else) in any Sins against
the Law of Nature. So that they
might disbelieve the Gospel <hi>impunè,</hi>
and without Punishment; but if they
were guilty of Blasphemy, Idolatry,
Adultery, Homicide, Theft, or any
other sins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> against the Light and Law
of Nature, the Laws did as severely
vindicate these Sins in them, as any
other Subjects.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:64424:175"/>
2. <hi>De jure,</hi> that rationally and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
good grounds of Justice, it might
be so; this is a harder Business, and
of that Difficulty, that I find not one
of those Casuists, or other Writers,
(who have writ of this Subject) so
much as offer at a Reason of it; that
is, All Christian Common-weals have
ever severely and indispensably pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Sins against the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and yet even then tolerated In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity,
and other Sins against the
Law of Scripture.</p>
               <p>Now (I conceive) that the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Reason of this Difference
(as to the Vindication of some, and
Toleration of other some Sins) must
be taken from the nature of the Sins
so vindicated or tolerated for.</p>
               <p>1. Sins against the Law of Nature
are evident, and manifestly such, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64424:175"/>
cannot possibly admit of any Apology
in any Persons who have the use of
Reason (for in Children and Ideots
the Case is otherwise.) It is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
Truth and a received Principle,
both amongst Philosophers, and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,
That <hi>Ignorantia Juris Naturalis
non excusat a peccato.</hi> So that if <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
commits Murder, Adultery, or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> we are sure he is a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and the Magistrate may safely
punish him for it, seeing there is no
possibility of any pretence whereby he
may render himself excusable either
from the Sin, or suffering for it.</p>
               <p>2. But then Secondly, for those
Sins against the positive Evangelical
Law, the Case is much otherwise, for</p>
               <p>1. No positive Law of God (or
Man) brings (or can bring) a just Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
upon us, till it have a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Promulgation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:64424:176"/>
2. The sufficiency of such Promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
is not easily known, for that
may be sufficient Promulgation to
one, which is not to another, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the different measure of Parts
and Abilities in those to whom it is
promulged. For those to whom
God hath given a larger measure of
Understanding and Learning, may
sooner come (unless they be wilfully
obstinate) to a Knowledge of the
Truth of the Gospel, and of those
Reasons which may convince them
of it; and then an Obligation comes
upon them to believe accordingly,
and if they do not they sin: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
others of no Learning, and less na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Abilities, may innocently disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
till further means (proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to their Capacities) be used for
their Conviction. Now this Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of knowing when the Promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is sufficient, and consequently
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64424:176"/>
when Infidelity is a Sin (for till this
time 'tis a Calamity, not a Crime.)
should make Magistrates very cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
not to precipitate the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of such misbelieving Persons:
For seeing in all such Punishments
there should be <hi>Congnitio culpae,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there can be <hi>Inflictio Paenae,</hi> he
that punisheth before he be certain
that the Person so punished is guilty
of the Crime, doth an Act that may
be just, but certainly he is not just in
doing it.</p>
               <p>3. But that which adds more Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
yet is this; That no Promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of any positive Law is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
till the Persons be convinced to
whom it is promulged, (unless
through their own Perverseness, for
Ends and Interest, they willfully hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
such Conviction.) Now whether
the Infidelity of the <hi>Jews</hi> arise from
the Perversity of their own Wills, or
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64424:177"/>
from their Infirmity and Want of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Preaching and Promulgation,
it is very hard (if not impossible) for
any Magistrate to know; and till it
be known, they cannot be justly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
for their Infidelity, which
neither is (nor can be) Sin in them
(nor any body else) till after suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Promulgation they wilfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
the Gospel. Now this great
Difficulty (and almost Impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
to know when they willfully
(and so criminally) reject the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
makes it very difficult propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably,
and almost impossible, for
any Magistrate justly to punish them
for such Rejection.</p>
               <p>4. We commonly say (and there
is much Truth in it if rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood)
that the Mysteries of the
Gospel are such as cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64424:177"/>
and<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 6. No man can come unto me unless the Father draw him.</note> assent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to without the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Assistance of the
blessed Spirit of God.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>And John</hi> 15. 5. Without me ye can do nothing.</note>
So that those who
want this Assistance, or
such a measure of it as may be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to overcome all opposed Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
cannot possibly believe, and
then it will be very questionable,
whether Infidelity in such be a Sin,
it not being in their Power (without
such Assistance) to believe. This in
Scripture is called <hi>the opening of the
heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> So when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Preach'd,
<hi>Lydia</hi> believes, others did not, and
the Reason is given in the Text,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 14.</note>
God opened the heart
of Lydia so that she at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to those things
spoken by Paul. Now as the opening
of her heart was no Merit or Act of
Virtue in her (it being the Work of
God upon her Soul, and the only pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64424:178"/>
in that particular) So the not
believing of others whose hearts he
was not pleased to open might pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
(at least for some time till they
had heard him further and seen his
Miracles) be no Sin in them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it will be sure enough, that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no humane Magistrate can know
whether the <hi>Jews</hi> now have such As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
or what Measure of it they
have, it will be hard for them to
punish, least in so doing they may
punish them for not doing that which
is impossible for them to do; which
with what Justice or Warrant from
God's Word, they can do, I know
not. And here I shall transcribe a
Passage in<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Hug. Grotius de Jure Belli.</hi> lib. 2. cap. 20. §. 48. pag. 345. <hi>Vide etiam An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notata ad dictum</hi> §.</note> 
                  <hi>Groti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
(casually by me,
but happily met with)
if I mistake not, very
pertinent to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<hi>Doctrina Evangelii ab his quinunc
eam audiunt penitùs in animum
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64424:178"/>
admitti nequeat, nisi Secretis Dei Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liis
accedentibus, quae sicut quibus dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
non dantur in operis alicujus merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem:
ita si quibus negantur, aut mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nùs
largè concedantur, id fit ob causas
non iniquas illas quidem sed plerúmque
nobis incognitas ac proinde humano ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicio
non Punibiles.</hi> And then he
adds many things out of Scripture
and Antiquity to the same purpose,
That neither <hi>Jews</hi> (nor any body
else) is (by Punishment) to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
to a Belief of the Gospel,
(that's a <hi>Turkish</hi> slavish means, which
may befit <hi>Mahomet</hi> to promote the
<hi>Alcoran,</hi> but certainly contradictory
to the Laws of Christ, and the
Meekness of Gospel Dispensations.)</p>
               <p>By what hath been said, I believe
it may appear in part that the Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the <hi>Jews</hi> in this, or any
Christian Common-weal, is not in it
self unlawful, either <hi>in ratione inho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesti
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64424:179"/>
incommodi</hi> or <hi>Scandali;</hi> but that
as <hi>de facto,</hi> they have been ever to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated
in Christian States, so <hi>de jure</hi>
they may still.</p>
               <p>So then the Readmission of the
<hi>Jews</hi> is in it self indifferent, yet
may be made morally good or bad
according to the several Ends, the
different Limitations and Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of their Admission. First, The
Ends of their admission may be either
<list>
                     <item>1. Civil,</item>
                     <item>2. Or Sacred and Religious.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. For the civil end of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
that is in general the Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument
and Benefit of the Prince,
and Common-weale. And though
<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>In compendio manualis.</hi> lib. 5. cap. 17. concl. 1. p. 510.</note>
                  <hi>Becanu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite
(with a transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
piece of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie)
condemn this end as unlawful,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64424:179"/>
it is evident that his great <hi>Jupiter
Capitolinus</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
as<note n="a" place="margin">Eubulus Corda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus in Epist. praefixâ libro Nicolas de Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mangis, de corrupto statu Ecclesiae.</note> one said long
since of some of his
Predecessors) makes
this an end (and a
principle one two) of their admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
and if he had no greater Faults,
I should pardon this. For Secondly,
'tis manifest that the Supreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
may justly make this one end
of their admission: For by his
Place and Office there lies an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon him to preserve the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Interest of his Nation, and the
Good and Benefit of the Common-weal,
and may propose it as an End
by all honourable and honest means
to be attained. Whence it is, that
all Princes protect and incourage
Trading, all Merchandizing, and
Manufactures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:64424:180"/>
2. The Sacred and Religious
End of their Admission should be
the Glory of God, and the Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the Gospel, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
and Salvation of their Souls.
And we are bound to endeavour
this</p>
               <p>1. By the natural Obligation of
Charity, as they are Men, and so
our Brethren, whose Good we ought
to promote (especially that of their
Souls) by all honest ways.</p>
               <p>2. And more particularly as they
are the <hi>Reliquiae</hi> of Gods own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
concerning whom, and their
Conversion, there are many gracious
and glorious Promises in the Gospel,
and it will be an Happiness to us if
we have an hand in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:64424:180"/>
It was a Saying of
<hi>Martin Luther</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">M. Luther in Epist. ad Jeselin. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeum Roshimensem operum. Tom. 6. Ton. German. fol. 509. <hi>apud Balduinum Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suum Conscienciae. 1. 6. cap. 6. Casu 5. pag.</hi> 188.</note> 
                  <hi>Se

Judaeis.</hi> And if
we love them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
their Conversion
and Salvation, (as in Christian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
certainly we ought) then the
way to effect that, will not be to
banish them, and prohibit their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
amongst us, so compelling
them to live amongst <hi>Turks, Pagans,</hi>
or <hi>Papists;</hi> The Images and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of which last, hath undeniably
been the greatest Scandal, and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mora,</hi>
which hath long hindred them
from being Christians. Whereas (if
they be permitted to live amongst
us) that stumbling-block will be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:64424:181"/>
2. For the Conditions of their
Admission, for the Restrictions and
Limitations to be put upon them, a
great deal of Caution and Christian
Prudence is to be used, lest while
we pretend their Good we do Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
to our selves. For as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
them all Liberty and Commerce
with us, may be an Act of unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
and indeed inhumane Cruelty;
So to give them too much, is an
Act of Imprudence and Folly. And
indeed we find some
<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Andrew Rivet. Comment. in cap. 23. Exodi. pag. 95. col.</hi> 2.</note>sober Men (not
without good Reason)
complain of the too
much Liberty they have in some
Christian Common-wealths. In short,
what Qualifications and Limitations
are to be put upon them, I shall not
take upon me to determine, but
leave that to the Piety and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64424:181"/>
of the State. Yet (with Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission)
I conceive such Limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as these will be convenient, if
not necessary; the rather because I
find in our Histories, in the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
and Canon Laws, and in the old
Capitulars and Canons of Councils,
that such Restrictions have been anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
laid upon them. As,</p>
               <p>1. No Toleration ever was, or <hi>de
jure</hi> can be given them to profess or
practice any thing against the Law of
Nature.</p>
               <p>2. No Toleration should be given
them to speak any thing blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
or impiously against <hi>Jesus
Christ</hi> and the <hi>Gospel:</hi> For though
we may tolerate them in the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of a bad, yet not
in that Blasphemy<note n="a" place="margin">Vide Rescript. Honorii &amp; Theodosii. A. A. Anthemio. P. P. L. Judaeos. 11. Cod de Judaeis.</note>
of a good Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:64424:182"/>
3. They never were nor should be

               <p>5. They were not permitted in

they set up the Images of <hi>thirteen

               <p>2. Their <hi>razing out the Sentences
of Scripture,</hi> formerly writ upon
the Walls, was <hi>absolutely Illegal,</hi> and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64424:191"/>
by no Law Warrantable: For those
Sentences were placed there (as
appears by the<note n="‖" place="margin">

<hi>Supreme Power</hi> of the King in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation;
and therefore for the
<hi>Painter and Parishioners</hi> to take away
that, which the <hi>Supreme Power had
by express Canon</hi> placed there, must
of necessity be Unwarrantable and
absolutely Illegal.</p>
               <p>Nor could the Deputy. Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor's
Order (got <hi>ex post facto</hi>) <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm</hi>
what they had <hi>illegally done:</hi>
For it is both <hi>Reason and Law,</hi> that
a <hi>Nullity is not capable of Confirmation,</hi>
because Confirmation always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposeth

Now it is certain that the <hi>Parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
had no Right to raze out</hi> those

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64424:192"/>
and therefore no Order (got <hi>ex post

<hi>Illegally done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Nor could the Deputy-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor's
Order (if they had procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it before they went to raze out
those Texts of Scripture formerly
writ upon the Walls) have given
them any just Power to raze out
those Texts; it being<note n="‖" place="margin">Quae contra Jus fiunt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent pro Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis haberi. <hi>De Reg. Juris. in</hi> 6. Reg. 64.</note> impossible

of happy Memory, and

away those Sentences of Scripture,</hi>
antiently writ upon the Walls,
have instead of them, writ some
other Sentences of Scripture in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Places where none were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
But this does not <hi>excuse,</hi> but
rather <hi>aggravate their Crime.</hi> For,</p>
               <p>1. This was not done till some
time after they had finished their
Work, wash'd out the Texts of
Scripture antiently writ upon the
Walls, and set up all their Images.
When finding what they had done
<hi>displeased</hi> many, (particularly their
Bishop) and that their Proceedings
were <hi>censured as Illegal,</hi> and by no
Law Warrantable; then, and not
till then, they caused some other
Texts of Scripture to be writ upon
the Walls.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:64424:193"/>
2. And this they did without
any <hi>Advice or Direction of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
or any who had the <hi>Cure of
their Souls:</hi> Whereas the Canon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
that<note n="‖" place="margin">Canones 1 Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobi, can. 88.</note> 
                  <hi>chosen Sentences</hi> of
Scripture should be writ upon the
Walls. And we may be sure that
the pious and learned King and
Convocation, who made that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
did not intend that the <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Painter and poor Parishioners,</hi>
but some who had more Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and Cure of their Souls,
should choose such Sentences as
should be for the Peoples Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
most plain and pertinent. But
no more of this. For although
what the <hi>Painter and a few private
Persons,</hi> did against the Canon and
Constitution of the <hi>Supreme Power,</hi>
was Illegal, and by no Law <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable,</hi>
yet the <hi>setting up Images</hi> in
the place of those Sentences of
Scripture, which they have erazed,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64424:194"/>
                  <hi>was much worse,</hi> as being repugnant
and directly contrary to the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Church of England,</hi> which
has been and is <hi>approved,</hi> and by

               </p>
               <p>By the Premisses it may, and I
believe does appear, that in the
<hi>Judgment of the Church of</hi> England,
<hi>Images are not to be tolerated in our

Worship;</hi> and therefore they were
<hi>removed</hi> and <hi>defaced</hi> by the <hi>Supreme
Powers Ecclesiastical and Civil,</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and published in <hi>Canons</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
and <hi>Acts of Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here it is objected by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of our Church and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64424:196"/>
That our Reformers have
been so zealous and indiscreetly
fierce against Images, that they
have <hi>condemn'd the ingenious Art of
Painting,</hi> and even the <hi>civil Use of
Images.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is a malicious Calumny,<note place="margin">Sol.</note>
and no <hi>real Consequence of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
Doctrine</hi> about Images, as has
been expresly and publickly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
both by our <hi>Church and State.</hi>
For,</p>
               <p>1. Our Church has declared her
Judgment, that <hi>all Images are not

nor do we condemn the Art of Painting

evident, that our Church is neither

any Civil Use of Images.</p>
               <p>2. Our State has (by express Act
of Parliament) declared, even in
the time of our Reformation, That
they did not <hi>condemn any Civil Use of
Images.</hi> For even in that Statute in
which they severely condemn, and
command the defacing Images in
Churches, they have this Proviso,

               <p>The Premisses being certain and

from them, to omit others,
will be these.</p>
               <p>1. That neither the Deputy-Chancellor
of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> nor any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Court, has or can have any
just Authority or Power to approve
and authorize the setting up of such
Images in the Church, which by
the Supreme Power (Ecclesiastical
and Civil, in Convocation and
Parliament) is expresly condemn'd
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64424:200"/>
as altogether unlawful, and to the
poor ignorant People pernicious.</p>
               <p>2. That they who maintain and
encourage this Doctrine of setting
up Images in our Churches, if they
persist in it, are by our known
Laws now in Force, to be <hi>excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
ipso facto;</hi> and if they be
beneficed Clergy-men, to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
<hi>Viderint quorum interest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. And if any Ecclesiastical Judg
or Court (<hi>quod absit</hi>) should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
authorize or encourage the
setting up of such Images in our
Churches, it evidently follows
from the Premisses, that in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they approve and authorize
that which the Church of <hi>England</hi>
has publickly declared to be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
against the Law of God,
against Christian Religion, and (to
many) pernicious. And therefore
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64424:200"/>
we have reason to believe, that no
good Son of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
will approve, authorize or
encourage that which his Holy
Mother has so absolutely and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
condemned.</p>

only a few things, which (to

            <p>1. The Question must be held

in Gratia:</hi> Neither <hi>Dominium Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porale,</hi>
of <hi>Kings</hi> or <hi>Lay-Magistrates;</hi>
nor <hi>Dominium Spirituale,</hi> of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops

            </p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Papists</hi> (who are both the
Accusers and Judges) do impute
this Opinion to <hi>Wickliff</hi> and <hi>Hus,</hi>
and their Followers, and condemn
the Opinion, and them for it, as
<hi>Hereticks,</hi> for saying, that <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64424:202"/>
fundatur in Gratia:</hi> which is a
manifest Calumny, and no just or
proved Accusation; as might be
proved out of <hi>Hus</hi> his <hi>printed Works,</hi>
and several <hi>Manuscript Works</hi> of
<hi>Wickliff</hi> in <hi>Bodley</hi>'s Library. But
they bring these lying Accusations
against them, that they may have
some pretence to destroy and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them.</p>
            <p>3. That erroneous and impious
<hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance, Anno</hi> 1413,
(which is an <hi>Oecumenical</hi> and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Council at <hi>Rome</hi>) having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd,
that our Blessed Saviour did
institute the <hi>Eucharist</hi> in both kinds,
they blasphemously add,<note n="†" place="margin">Concillum Constantieuse, <hi>Sess.</hi> 13.</note> 
               <hi>Quod non

               <hi>Wickliff</hi> and his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.</p>
            <p>4. I do not find any <hi>Popish</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
who affirms and approves
this Proposition (<hi>Dominium funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
in Gratia</hi>) in those very <hi>Terms</hi>
in which the Council of <hi>Constance</hi>
had condemned it as <hi>Heretical:</hi>
For this were to contradict their
own Principles, and approve that
for <hi>Truth,</hi> which their Supreme In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Guide (a General Council)
had <hi>Synodically</hi> declared Heresy.</p>
            <p>5. But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
(though in other Terms) doth both
profess and practise this Doctrine,
that <hi>Dominium fundatur in Gratia:</hi>
For they say, that <hi>Dominium funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
in Fide &amp; Religione Catholica,</hi> (so
they miscal Popery, or the Roman
Religion) so that if any Man, by
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64424:203"/>
Apostacy, desert their Religion,
or, by Heresy, deny any Article of
their Faith, he does not only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
his <hi>Dominion</hi> over his Inferiors,
but all his Goods and Livelihood,
and his Life here, and eternal Life
hereafter. This is the erroneous and
impious Doctrine of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> approved and vindicated,
not only by their <hi>Schoolmen, Casuists,
Canonists, Summists,</hi> &amp;c. but recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
into the <hi>Body</hi> of their <hi>Canon-Law,</hi>
in their last, and (as they
say) the most correct <hi>Editions</hi> of it,
and declared and confirmed in
their <hi>General</hi> Councils. That this
may appear, I shall (of many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds)
give you some few, but
pertinent and great Instances.</p>

apostatantibus a Fide, non est o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bediendum.</hi>
And again, when such
an Apostate Prince is excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cared;
<hi>Ipso facto, ejus Subditi à do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minio

this great <hi>Council</hi> (which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg

expresly declares, That an
<hi>Heretick</hi> (tho a <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Emperour</hi>)
does by his <hi>Heresy</hi> forfeìt all his
<hi>Dominion;</hi> and therefore with them
<hi>Dominion</hi> must be <hi>in Fide fundatum,</hi>
that is, in their <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Popish
Faith. For if believing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
in that Faith, do preserve
their Dominion; and the rejecting
it by Heresy, forfelt it; then it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
and evidently follows,
that their Roman Catholick <hi>Faith</hi>
is the Foundation of their <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and the Cause which preserves
it, as <hi>Heres</hi> is the Cause why they
lose it. And as this is their Popish
impious Doctrine, that not only
Subjects, but Supreme Governors,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64424:205"/>
Kings and Emperors, forfeit their
Dominions by Heresy; so the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice

been suitably impious and sinful.

same reason, (because Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
was an Heretick) excommunicates

Kingdoms to <hi>Philip</hi> the 2<hi>d</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi>
who came with his great <hi>Armada,</hi>

brought the Curse of God upon
him and his Fleet, for there is no
Power or Policy against Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence)

many hundred thousands

But his Sacred Majesty
having graciously promised to
maintain the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
as it is by Law establish'd, (who
has ever been, and I doubt not,
will be faithful in his Promises)
this secures me against such Fears,

thought seasonable to stop such Persons

is most due for that and many
more Civilities) my hearty Thanks.
News here we have none, and so I
cannot requite your Kindness, by
sending you (what you so kindly
send me) Intelligence. You have
seen (I believe) <hi>Machiavel</hi>'s Works
(translated out of <hi>Italian</hi> or <hi>Latine</hi>)
in <hi>English,</hi> which came out the last
Year, 1675. The <hi>Printer</hi> (in the
second Page) says, it was <hi>Licensed,</hi>
but tells us not by whom. In the
end of it, there is a <hi>Letter of Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avel</hi>'s
(so 'tis pretended) <hi>in Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Writings.</hi> That Letter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
two things; 1. To mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
<hi>Democracy,</hi> (as the best Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
and decry <hi>Monarchy.</hi> 2. To
decry the <hi>Clergy</hi> in general (not only
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64424:207"/>
those of <hi>Rome</hi>) as a sort of People,
so <hi>far from holy,</hi> that <hi>they have nothing
left of Integrity or Humanity.</hi> He tells
us <hi>of an execrable innate ill Quality in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable
from the Priest-craft,
and the
Conjuration or Spell of their new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nvented
Ordination;</hi>
and would have <hi>them
rooted out so, as not one</hi> Sibra <hi>were left,
&amp;c.</hi> When twas printed, (by
whose Authority or Advice I know
not) a considerable Piece (one
whole Leaf in <hi>Folio</hi>) was left out,
which I have in <hi>MS.</hi> and do here
enclosed send you a Copy of it.
The business of that Piece which is
left out, is to tell us, <hi>what is not
Rebellion,</hi> (so he pretends;) and if
his Principles be true, we have had
no <hi>Rebellion</hi> in <hi>England</hi> this 40 Years.

            <p>NOW having gone thus far
in the Description of <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi>
I think my self obliged to tell
you what I conceive not to be <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</hi>
Whosoever then takes up
Arms to maintain the Politick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
or Government of his
Country in the Condition it then is,
I mean to defend it from being
changed or invaded, by the Craft
or Force of any Man, (altho it be
in the Prince or Chief Magistrate
himself) Provided that such taking
up of Arms be commanded or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
by those, who are by the
Orders of that Government legally
intrusted with the Custody of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64424:208"/>
Liberty of the People, and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the Government; this I
hold to be so far from <hi>Rebellion,</hi>
that I believe it laudable, nay, the
Duty of every Member of such
Common wealth: for he who
fights to support and defend the
Government he was born and lives
under, cannot deserve the odious
Name of <hi>Rebel,</hi> but he who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to destroy it.</p>
            <p>If this be not granted, it will be
in vain to frame any mixt Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies
in the World; yet such is at
this Day the happy Form under
which almost all <hi>Europe</hi> lives, as
the People of <hi>France, Spain, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,
Poland, Sweedland, Denmark,
&amp;c.</hi> wherein the Prince hath his
Share, and the People theirs;
which last, if they had no means
of recovering their Rights, if ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from them, or defending them,
if invaded, would be in the same
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64424:208"/>
Estate, as if they had no Title to
them, but lived under the Empire
of <hi>Turkey</hi> or of <hi>Muscovy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And since they have no other
Remedy but by Arms, and that it
would be of ill consequence to
make every private Man judg
when the Rights of the People (to
which they have as lawful a Claim
as the Prince to his) are invaded,
which would be apt to produce fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
and sometimes causless,
Tumults; therefore it hath been
the great Wisdom of the Founders
of such Monarchies, to appoint
Guardians to their Liberty, which
if it be not otherwise express'd, is,
and ought to be understood to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
in the <hi>Estates</hi> of the Country,
which for that reason, (as also to
exercise their Share in the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,
as making Laws, levying
Monies) are frequently assembled
in all these Regions in <hi>Europe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64424:209"/>
These are to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
and mantain the Orders of
the Government, and the Laws
Establish'd, (if it cannot be done
otherwise) to arm the People, to
defend and repel the Force that is
upon them. Nay, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Arragon</hi> goes farther; and
because in the Intervals of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
or Courts, many Accidents
may intervene to the prejudice of
their <hi>Rights</hi> or <hi>Fueros,</hi> as they call
them, they have, during the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
appointed a Magistrate,
called <hi>Justitia,</hi> who is, by the Law
and Constitution of that Kingdom,
to assemble the whole People to
his Banner, whenever such Rights
are incroach'd upon, who are not
only justified by the Laws for such
coming together, but are severely
punishable in case of Refusal. So
that there is no question, but that
if the Kings of <hi>Arragon</hi> (at this day
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64424:209"/>
very powerful, by the Addition of
the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and of
<hi>Sicily,</hi> and the Union of <hi>Castile</hi>)
should in time to come invade their
Kingdom of <hi>Arragon</hi> with the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of their new Dominions, and
endeavour to take from them the
Rights and Priviledges they enjoy
lawfully by their Constitution,
there is no question, I say, but
they may (tho their King be there
in Person against them) assemble
under their <hi>Justitia,</hi> and defend
their Liberties with as much Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
as if they were invaded by
the <hi>French,</hi> or by the <hi>Turk:</hi> for it
were absurd to think, since the
People may be legally assembled
to apprehend Robbers, nay, to
deliver a Possession forcibly detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against the Sentence of some
Inferiour Court; that they may
and ought not to bestir themselves,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64424:210"/>
to keep in Being, and preserve
that Government which maintains
them in possession of their Liberty
and Property, and defends their
Lives too from being Arbitrarily
taken away.</p>
            <p>But I know this clear Truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
Opposition in this unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
and corrupt Age, when
Men are more prone to flatter the
Lusts of Princes than formerly,
and the Favourites are more impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
to hear the Impartiality of
Laws, than the Sons of <hi>Brutus</hi>
were, who complained, <hi>Leges esse
surdas;</hi> that is, though they were
fine Gentlemen, in favour with the
Ladies, and Ministers of the King's
Pleasure, yet they could not Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,
Drink, Whore, nor Kill the
Officers of Justice in the Streets,
returning from their Night-Revels;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64424:210"/>
but the Execution of the Laws
would reach them as well as others,
who in the time of <hi>Tarquin,</hi> it
seems, found the Prince more exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
Nay, the very <hi>Divines</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
help with their Fallacies to
oppugn this Doctrine, by making
us believe, as I said before, that it
is God's Will all Princes should be
Absolute, and are so far in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy
against Mankind, that they
assert that in the Text (<hi>This shall
the Manner of your King be</hi>) God
was giving that People the <hi>Jus
Divinum</hi> of Government, when in
truth he was threatning them with
Plagues of Monarchy. But I
spare the <hi>Divines</hi> here, since I shall
have occasion, in discoursing of
my next Accusation, to shew how
that sort of People have dealt
with God's Truths, and with the
Interest of Men. And to be as
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64424:211"/>
good as my Word, I shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
fall upon that Point, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
