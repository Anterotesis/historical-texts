            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And would ye have the fire kindled to rise up in such a great flame, as both to destroy your selves, and many innocent people in the Nation? What, is every one seeking to gratifie his Interests and Party, and to satisfie his will? And is there none that seeks that the Will of God may be done in earth, among the sons of men, that God might once delight to do us good, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle these Nations in peace and freedom, as men, and as Christians.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Consider: Hath not this been the end which hath been proposed by all good men, who have not sought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but hath ventured all that this might be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29555:3"/>
which if it had been, or were, or could be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto, would be a perfect recompence and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all, and to all, who have sought it in their heart, <hi>viz.</hi> Freedom from oppression in their persons and estates, which hath not been by reason of the many wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Laws which have been imposed to satisfie the self-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests of some particular men, which did imbondage all other. Secondly, Liberty and freedom of conscience in the exercise of their consciences to Christ, who is Gods annointed, according to the manifestation of his Light and Spirit to them, unto whom, and before whom all must give an account, and be judged; but this hath been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hindred by them who have re-assumed a Power, and have usurped Authority to themselves, and have made laws to the imbondaging of the dear and precious people of God in these Nations, though you have been talking of the Good old Cause, these are not revocated and overturned, by which very many suffers to this day.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is not Names, Titles, Denominations, and Words that we look after, and which will effect the thing propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, which while some have been contending after, have let go the thing in hand, and have lost it, and so sets up a particular interest, and it clothes it self with the words and fair speeches, but nothing is brought forth, and so by fair speeches and flatteries the people have been deceived and cheated.</p>

been evident in this Nation, in these many revolutions, although that power which was first in being, which was ordained for the end aforesaid, being swerved from the thing, might say to that which rose up against it, that it was rebellion and treason, and declare it to be such in the ears of the people, as hath been done by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ivers, which is in the memory of most, so that I need not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; when I say it was not so accounted by the Lord, and he hath given testimony of this by the overthrowing the former, and raising up the latter, and hath stood by it, while it stood in his counsel; as for one instance, the Long-Parliament against the late King, which in mans account could be looked upon to be no other then rebellion, yet God gave a signal testimony to the one, while they stood in the power of God, and against the other.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Was not Israel governed sometime by Judges, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the Elders, and sometime by Kings? and while they stood in the counsel of the Lord, and the people hearkned to them, was not the Lord among them, and sometime raised up unlikely means, as to mans wisdom; as <hi>David</hi> a Shepherds Boy, and <hi>Gideon</hi> a Thresher, and he was made a Judge, and a Redeemer of Israel out of their sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; but mind this still, While they stood in Gods equal counsel, which led to do equally to, and for the good of all, according to Gods institution and appointment, then they were blessed; but when either Ruler, Governor, or Governors went from the power of the Lord, in which they onely had authority to rule, and to do justly; but when they went from that, and became corrupt in their minds, and hearts, and blindness came upon them, as it is said, <hi>Blindness happened to Israel through their unbelief;</hi> and what was the effect thereof? <hi>The Judges judged for rewards and gifts, the Prophets prophesied for hire, and the Pri<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Is not the same blindness happened to <hi>England?</hi> When will her Rulers, Judges, Prophets, Priests see their error? Is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

When will these things be done away, that every one may be approved and manifest, how be loves his Nation, or how he seeks the good thereof, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out himself freely, and acting freely without so much chargeableness to the Nation; I do not mean the Soldiery, but men imployed in civil affairs, and the Ministry, who would be counted godly and painful, to publish freely, or else be si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The ancient Courtiers having found so much ease and profit by the late King, turned all Cavaliers, and cryed up the Prerogative of the King, above Law and Equity, setting that aside wholly which all good government was intended for, as the safety of the people, and freedom from oppression, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and usurpation, and that none might be imbondaged in the Worship of God; but when he and his assistants sought to inthrall all, and imbondage all, both in civil and Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical things, as they were called; the Long-Parliament and the People that aided them at that time, counted it no trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to oppose him, seeing the end was not answered which he should have satisfied; and God desided the controversie i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowing the one, and establishing the other for a season; yet many are so blind to this day, that they judge the Nation cannot be established in freedom without a King, as though such a Name were Essential onely to freedom, and without it could not be obtained; but the judicious will see this igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</p>
            <p>So now many are so doting on the Name of a Parliament, as though it were essential, or the name to be the foundation of Government, and cryes up the Priviledge of Parliament, as the former did Prerogative, and would fight about a Name in their heat and passion, and lose the thing intended, though they be the Representative of the people to do good to the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29555:4"/>
people, and not hurt; they are accounted as good servants to God, and to them that elected them; but if they would so soon as got together, set up a particular Interest, which serves to the imbondaging of the whole, and then cry up their priviledge to do what they list; then it is no rebellion in Gods account, neither in the account of just men, to call them away, when they do not perform the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; but if they will not hearken to the cry of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters (the People) but may be call them rebels or traytors if they should be turned out, because they have clothed themselves with the name of higher power, when alas they are gone from that in which their power, priviledge, and authority stood.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And this I have to say to that part of the Army who stands so much upon the name of Parliament, and would seem to oppose all the rest, whether army, or the people from whence their power did at first arise, when they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish not the end that they meet for, neither intended so to do, but to set up some, and make the rest always suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers, if you should take part herein, and manage your weapons, for a sound or a name, or for something that may sute you, though damnifie many thousands; it will not go well with you; for God looketh not as man, neither judges he according to mans wisdom; therefore be not rash nor hasty to shed blood upon this account, but take counsel in time; lest an outstretched arm stop you in your way to your detriment and hurt, and you may repent too late; it is not your declaring in words for the Good Old Cause, neither your Proclamations nor Declarations in good words, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taking God to witness that will satisfie the people, who have been, and are present sufferers; we have had enough of that, from all the former Asserters of liberty in words, but the thing is not done; so be less in words, and more in action, and deeds for righteousness; and though you may seemingly retort the sayings of this Army in <hi>England</hi> upon them, how they received Commissions from the Parlament, and promised to be faithful to them,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29555:5"/>
and did that they repented of that such things should get up to rule &amp; have dominion, as was acted by the two late Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors, whom the Parlament and you judged Usurpers, and so you take advantage at this, to spread forth this to their reproach in the nation; this is not brotherly done, neither is that spirit that will forgive, and suffer long, but is heady, though they did receive Commissions, and promise to bee faithful, yet the end I believe was still premised by them, as to be servants to them, for the foresaid end, The Good Old Cause: 1. Freed as men from oppression. 2. <hi>As</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, from being imposed upon either by antient Laws, or Laws which hereafter might be made, which hindered the aforesaid Cause and end, of all the travel, expence, and suffering in the Nation, which they would never have done: Therefore the Army in putting a stop to that which did retard and draw back from that end aforesaid, in Gods sight, and in the fight of all illuminated men, is no Rebellion nor Treachery.</p>
            <p n="9">9. And as for the Long Parlament by whom God did good things, and great things, in the overthrowing that power, which was deviated from the aforesaid end; (to wit) the late King, yet the Axe must not boast it self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him that hewed onely with it for a time to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish his end, and when he pleases take up another instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and let the first lie still. What they did, they had the approbation of God and good men; yet they went not through with the work purposed and intended. And though they were called together in a time of straits, when that which had obstructed through flattery and ambition was taken away, yet still you who were the Members of the Old Parlament remaining, were called together, for to help to accomplish the aforesaid end, and to carry on the Good Old Cause; but truly you sticked in the mire, and did not run chearfully, but had your ears open to them that could complement and flatter, and their business you would hear, and return them thanks; but them who
