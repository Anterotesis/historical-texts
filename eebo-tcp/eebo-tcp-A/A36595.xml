            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>To the Honourable Sir <hi>WILLIAM LEVISON GOWER,</hi> Bar.</head>
                  <p>THere is one kind of Vertue, which is inborn in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and indeed in moſt of the Ancient Families of this Nation; they are not apt to inſult on the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of their Countrymen. But you, Sir, I may tell it you without Flattery, have grafted on this natural Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeration, and rais'd it to a Nobler Vertue: As you have been pleas'd to honour me, for a long time, with ſome part of your Eſteem and your good Will; ſo in particular, ſince the late Revolution, you have increas'd the Proofs of your kindneſs to me; and not ſuffer'd the difference of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which produce ſuch Hatred and Enmity in the brutal Part of Human kind, to remove you from the ſettled Baſis of your good Nature and good Sence. This Nobleneſs of yours, had it been exercis'd on an Enemy, had certainly been a Point of Honour, and as ſuch I might have juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended it to the World: But that of conſtancy to your former Choice, and the purſuance of your firſt Favours, are Vertues not overcommon amongſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men. All things of Honour have, at beſt, ſomewhat of Oſtentation in them, and Self-love; there is a Pride of doing more than is expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from us, and more than others would have done. But to proceed in the ſame Tract of Goodneſs, Favour, and Protection, is to ſhew that a Man is acted by a thorough Principle: It carries ſomewhat of Tenderneſs in it, which is Humanity in a Heroical Degree; 'tis a kind of unmoveable good Nature; a word which is commonly Deſpis'd, becauſe it is ſo ſeldom Practis'd. But after all, 'tis the moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Vertue, oppos'd to the moſt degenerate Vice, which is
<pb facs="tcp:96109:3"/>
that of Ruggedneſs and Harſhneſs to our Fellow Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>'Tis upon this knowledge of you, Sir, that I have choſen you, with your permiſſion, to be the Patron of this Poem. And, as ſince this wonderful Revolution, I have begun with the beſt Pattern of Humanity, the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter;</hi> I ſhall continue to follow the ſame Method, in all, to whom I ſhall Addreſs; and endeavour to pitch on ſuch only, as have been pleas'd to own me in this Ruin of my ſmall Fortune; who, though they are of a contrary Opinion themſelves, yet blame not me for adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to a loſt Cauſe; and judging for my ſelf, what I cannot chuſe but judge; ſo long as I am a patient Sufferer, and no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturber of the Government. Which, if it be a ſevere Penance, as a great Wit has told the World, 'tis at leaſt enjoyn'd me by my ſelf: And <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> as much a Fool as I, was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to diſcipline his Body, no farther than he found he could endure the ſmart.</p>
                  <p>You ſee, Sir, I am not entertaining you, like <hi>Ovid,</hi> with a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Epiſtle from <hi>Pontus;</hi> I ſuffer no more, than I can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily undergo; and ſo long as I enjoy my Liberty, which is the Birth-right of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, the reſt ſhall never go near my Heart. The Merry Philoſopher, is more to my Humour than the Melancholick; and I find no diſpoſition in my ſelf to Cry, while the mad World is daily ſupplying me with ſuch Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Laughter. The more reaſonable ſort of my Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, have ſhewn ſo much favour to this Piece, that they give me no doubt of their Protection for the future.</p>
                  <p>As you, Sir, have been pleas'd to follow the Example of their Goodneſs, in favouring me: So give me leave to ſay, that I follow yours in this Dedication, to a Perſon of a different Perſwaſion. Though I muſt confeſs withal, that I have had a former Encouragement from you for this Addreſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the warm Remembrance of your noble Hoſpitality to me at
<pb facs="tcp:96109:3"/>
                     <hi>Trentham,</hi> when ſome years a go I viſited my Friends and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in your Country, has ever ſince given me a violent Temptation to this boldneſs.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, were this Comedy wholly mine, I ſhould call it a Trifle, and perhaps not think it worth your Patronage; but when the Names of <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Moliere</hi> are joyn'd in it; that is, the two greateſt Names of Ancient and Modern Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, I muſt not preſume ſo far on their Reputation, to think their beſt and moſt unqueſtion'd Productions can be term'd Little. I will not give you the trouble, of acquainting you what I have added, or alter'd in either of them, ſo much it may be for the worſe; but only that the difference of our Stage from the <hi>Roman</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> did ſo require it. But I am affraid, for my own Intereſt, the World will too eaſily diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that more than half of it is mine; and that the reſt is rather a lame Imitation of their Excellencies, than a juſt Tranſlation. 'Tis enough, that the Reader know by you, that I neither deſerve nor deſire any Applauſe from it: If I have perform'd any thing, 'tis the Genius of my Authors that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd me; and if it has pleas'd in Repreſentation, let the Actors ſhare the Praiſe amongſt themſelves. As for <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Moliere,</hi> they are dangerous People; and I am too weak a Gameſter to put my ſelf into their Form of Play. But what has been wanting on my Part, has been abundantly ſupplyed by the Excellent Compoſition of Mr. <hi>Purcell;</hi> in whoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we have at length found an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> equal with the beſt abroad. At leaſt my Opinion of him has been ſuch, ſince his happy and judicious Performances in the late <hi>Opera;</hi> and the Experience I have had of him, in the ſetting my Three Songs for this <hi>Amphitryon:</hi> To all which, and particularly to the Compoſition of the <hi>Paſtoral Dialogue,</hi> the numerous Quire of Fair Ladies gave ſo juſt an Applauſe on the Third Day. I am only ſorry, for my own ſake, that there was one
<pb facs="tcp:96109:4"/>
Star wanting, as Beautiful as any in our Hemiſphere; that young <hi>Berenice,</hi> who is miſimploying all her Charms on ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Country Souls, that can never know the Value of them; and loſing the Triumphs, which are ready prepar'd for her in the Court and Town. And yet I know not whether I am ſo much a loſer by her abſence; for I have Reaſon to apprehend the ſharpneſs of her Judgment, if it were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd with the ſweetneſs of her Nature; and after all, I fear ſhe may come time enough, to diſcover a Thouſand Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections in my Play, which might have paſs'd on Vulgar Underſtandings. Be pleas'd to uſe the Authority of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther over her, on my behalf; enjoyn her to keep her own Thoughts of <hi>Amphitryon</hi> to her ſelf; or at leaſt not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him too ſtrictly with <hi>Moliere</hi>'s. 'Tis true, I have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in this Partiality of hers; but withal, I plead ſome ſort of Merit for it, in being ſo Particularly as I am,</p>

                           <p>Here's Omnipotence with a Vengeance, to make a Man a Cuckold, and yet not to do him wrong. Then I find, Father <hi>Jupiter,</hi> that when you made Fate, you had the wit to contrive a Holy-day for your ſelf now and then. For you Kings never Enact a Law, but you have a kind of an Eye to your own Prerogative.</p>

                        <p>I muſt take a little extraordinary pains to night, that my Spouſe may come even with her Lady, and produce a Squire to attend on young <hi>Hercules,</hi> when he goes out to ſeek Adventures; that when his Maſter kills a Man, he may ſtand ready to pick his Pockets; and piouſly relieve his Aged Parents. Ah, <hi>Bromia, Bromia;</hi> if thou hadſt been as handſome and as young as <hi>Phaedra;</hi> I ſay no more, but ſome-body might have made his Fortunes as well as his Maſter, and never the worſe Man neither.</p>
                        <l>For, let the wicked World ſay what they pleaſe,</l>
                        <l>The fair Wife makes her Husband live at eaſe:</l>
                        <l>The Lover keeps him too; and but receives,</l>

                     <l>I'M thinking, (and it almoſt makes me mad,)</l>
                     <l>How ſweet a time, thoſe Heathen Ladies had.</l>
                     <l>Idolatry, was ev'n their Gods own trade;</l>
                     <l>They Worſhipt the ſine Creatures they had made.</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Cupid,</hi> was chief of all the Deities;</l>
                     <l>And Love was all the faſhion, in the Skies.</l>
                     <l>When the ſweet Nymph, held up the Lilly hand,</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Jove,</hi> was her humble Servant, at Command.</l>
                     <l>The Treaſury of Heav'n was ne're ſo bare,</l>
                     <l>But ſtill there was a Penſion for the Fair.</l>
                     <l>In all his Reign, Adultry was no Sin;</l>
                     <l>For <hi>Jove,</hi> the good Example did begin.</l>
                     <l>Mark, too when he uſurp'd the Husband's name,</l>
                     <l>How civilly he ſav'd the Ladies fame.</l>
                     <l>The ſecret Joys of Love, he wiſely hid;</l>
                     <l>But you, Sirs, boaſt of more, than e'er you did.</l>

                     <l>And, in the kind remembrance of the Fair,</l>
                     <l>On each exalted Son, beſtow'd a Star.</l>

                     <l>His Godſhip, flouriſh'd full Two thouſand Years.</l>

                     <l>The Ladies grew in their devotion cold;</l>

                     <l>(And always does, when we no more can Sin.)</l>
                     <l>That Doctrine, too, ſo hard, in Practice, lyes,</l>
                     <l>That, the next Age may ſee another riſe.</l>
