         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <l>Her haire since sixtie yeares not blacke, was now or white or none,</l>
                     <l>The substance of her wrinkled face was only skin and bone,</l>
                     <l>Dimme were her eyes, deafe were her eares, tanke smelt it shee could sent,</l>
                     <l>A Palsie made her feeling cease, downe tastlesse food it went.</l>
                     <l>Sight, hearing, sent, touch, tast, and all, thus failing with her strength,</l>
                     <l>She to her chamber, bed, and chaire, betooke her at the length.</l>
                     <l>But gold is lou'd till graue hath lodg'd, her bags and she were one:</l>
                     <l>And she must giue the Maidens Dowre, or els her Dowre is none.</l>
                     <l>The young man, though he lou'd the Maid, on whom no loue was lost,</l>
                     <l>Yeat did he loue to liue, and knew that marriage asketh cost.</l>
                     <l>The olde wiues bags did let the Banes: with whom he smoothed so,</l>
                     <l>That flattered, she fantised, her moldie braines did cro.</l>
                     <l>What Diuel I wote not made her dote, she doted on the man:</l>
                     <l>Her rotten trunke and rustie face she finified than:</l>
                     <l>And seeth what she could not see, her senslesse Senses worke,</l>

And vnderneath a wrinckled hide a wanton heart did lurke.</l>
                     <l>Vnkindly too she kisses gaue, which he did kindly take,</l>
                     <l>Supposing that her kindnes was but for the Maidens sake.</l>
                     <l>Her crooked ioynts, which long ere then supported, scarcely stood,</l>
                     <l>She brought vnto a wallowing pace, disiellowing so her bloud:</l>
                     <l>And all for loue (surreuerence Loue) did make her chew the cudde.</l>

                     <l>Young <hi>Battus</hi> from his <hi>Omphida</hi> (for they were named so)</l>
                     <l>Dislodged by the Grandame long, to worke did roundly goe:</l>
                     <l>Desiring both the Maiden, and to marrie her a Dower.</l>
                     <l>The old-wife, netled at his words, for all her loue did lower,</l>
                     <l>And drying vp what drained out in belching, thus did say:</l>
                     <l>The thing (friend <hi>Battus)</hi> you demaund I gladly not denay,</l>
                     <l>But well you wot that I am old, and yeat not all so old,</l>
                     <l>But that the remnant of my life may spend the wealth I holde.</l>
                     <l>As all are neerest to themselues, so to my selfe am I:</l>
                     <l>And all shall lacke ere I will lacke: store is no sore we trie.</l>
                     <l>If you doe like of <hi>Omphida,</hi> I also like the match:</l>
                     <l>Loue hath no lacke, ye both are young, wealth comes to such as watch.</l>
                     <l>You louing her, she to her selfe a dowrie is, if not,</l>
                     <l>My money shall not sell the Maid, a sinfull sale God wot:</l>
                     <l>For money shall not sell my selfe. And yeat I cannot see,</l>
                     <l>But that a comfort to mine age an honest match would be.</l>
                     <l>My Goods besides doe want a Guide, and often did I know</l>
                     <l>Your youngers vpon elder wiues then I themselues bestow,</l>
                     <l>And liued well, and loued well. But as I doe not care</l>
                     <l>For mariage, so an honest match I neuer will forsweare.</l>
                     <l>Well, <hi>Battus,</hi> take you <hi>Omphida:</hi> but if you money craue,</l>
                     <l>My bagges must onely vent to him whome I my selfe shall haue.</l>
                     <l>Yeat thinke not I mislike of you in that you haue not sped,</l>
                     <l>But thinke I wish no better match, if I my selfe should wed.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Thus cunningly she closde with him, and he conceaues her thought:</l>
                     <l>Vnequall was the Combat then that Loue and Lucar wrought.</l>
                     <l>The one was in her flowring age, the other to too old:</l>

                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:20240:32"/>
The first with beautie did allure, the latter with her Gold.</l>
                     <l>But stormes (thought <hi>Battus)</hi> haue their stops, not long the Croen can liue,</l>
                     <l>Or if my kindenes length her life, my kindenes God forgiue.</l>
                     <l>Reso luing therefore on such hope, with easie sute he got</l>
                     <l>Assurance to be wedded to the old deformed Trot.</l>
                  </lg>

                     <l>Did worke no lesse a euer vpon this vaine vnweldie Tyke.</l>
                     <l>Now on the bridle played she: yeat as she laughes she lookes</l>
                     <l>With ielious eyes, if <hi>Omphida</hi> be blotted out his bookes.</l>
                     <l>Yea she that could not moue before, now crauleth euery wheare,</l>
                     <l>To prye if <hi>Battus</hi> play not false, and cause there was to feare.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>But all this while no mariage was, nor witnes of their match:</l>
                     <l>And well he knewe that widdowes shrinke, if men forslowe dispatch.</l>
                     <l>So hasting what she hindred not, come was the wedding day:</l>
                     <l>The Morning thawde the eauening frost, and slipprie was the way:</l>
                     <l>Yeat hobling on her rustie ioynts, to Churchward goes the Bride:</l>
                     <l>Whose feete (her harts vnequall gides) could nothing els but slide.</l>
                     <l>Then <hi>Battus</hi> kindly leadeth her, and euer as she trips,</l>
                     <l>God blesse thee Mouse the Bridegroome said, and smakt her on the lips.</l>
                     <l>The oftner stumbled then his Beast, the oftner to be kist:</l>
                     <l>And thinketh in her gentle Choyse her selfe not meanly blist.</l>
                     <l>But when the Priest had done his part, and that they homeward come,</l>
                     <l>The Bride, for <hi>Battus,</hi> might salute the Pauement with her bomme.</l>
                     <l>She reeled oft, and looked backe: he sawe, but would not see:</l>
                     <l>At length she stumbled headlong downe, hoyst vp againe, quoth hee:</l>
                     <l>The second tyme she did the like, hoyst Brock, her good-man saide:</l>
                     <l>And thirdly falling, kindly bad her breake her necke, olde Iade.</l>
                     <l>The old-wife tooke it to the hart, and home she went and dyde:</l>
                     <l>But <hi>Battus,</hi> ere his first was sicke, had owed his second Bryde.</l>

                     <l>See yonder doting foole, said Folke, that crauleth scarce for age,</l>
                     <l>Doth set the Boye vpon his Asse and makes himselfe his Page.</l>
                     <l>Anon the blamed Boy alightes, and lets the Old-man ride,</l>
                     <l>And, as the Old-man did before, the Boye the Asse did gide:</l>
                     <l>But, passing so, the people the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did much the Old-man blame,</l>
                     <l>And told him, Churle, thy limbes bee tough, the Boye should ride for shame.</l>
                     <l>The fault thus found, both Man and Boye did backe the Asse and ride,</l>
                     <l>Then that the Asse was ouer-charg'd each man that met them cride.</l>
                     <l>Now both a-light, and goe on foote, and leade the emptie Beast,</l>
                     <l>But then the people laugh, and say, that one might ride at least.</l>
                     <l>With it they both did vndershore the Asse on either side,</l>
                     <l>But then the wondring people did that witles pranke deride.</l>
                     <l>The Old-man seeing by no waies he could the people please,</l>
                     <l>Not blameles then, did driue the Asse and drowne him in the Seas.</l>
                     <l>Thus whil'st we be, it will not be, that any pleaseth all:</l>
                     <l>Els had bin wanting, worthely, the noble <hi>Caesars</hi> fall.</l>

Perhaps experience beating vs doth bid vs lay to thriue:</l>
                     <l>The first degree to which (say some) is warely to wiue.</l>
                     <l>But, wiued, if our Sainct become (as not vnlike) a Shroe,</l>

                     <l>Doe graunt her silence, patience, and what vertues els be rare,</l>

                     <l>Our selues and sences, yea perchance, labour the most we may,</l>

                     <l>Was earliest vp, with him I met, and he admired me.</l>
                     <l>I hild him wing, and wistly he suruaies me round about,</l>
                     <l>And lastly, knowing who I was, did giue me many a flout,</l>

                     <l>Then, shifting out of sight, I hung till Twilight in a hoole,</l>

                     <l>In vaine I wisht reducement of my shape, and (which was worste)</l>
                     <l>My hap was harder than to owne in that distresse a Cruft.</l>

                     <l>Then curst I mine aspiring minde, then knew I <hi>Dis</hi> a Diuell,</l>
