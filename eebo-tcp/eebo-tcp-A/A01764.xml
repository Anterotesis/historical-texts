            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>TO HIS GOOD FREND SAMVEL DANIEL, N. W. Wisheth health.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Knowe not whether to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse your nature (good M. DANIEL) or blame your shamefastnesse, which so much laboreth (as the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enemy of your good name) to defraude your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors of their deserued Lawrell, &amp; in despight of arte to depriue vs of so delicate inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions, which the best wits in <hi>Europe</hi> haue dedicated to posteritie: wherein surely, you iniurie your countreymen publikely, vnnaturally your frends, and vnaduisedly your selfe. But what can you pretend? The seueritie of Censors, the nice delicatenes of Courtiers, or the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetie of Philosophers? What Philosophy taught you that? That which is currant may abyde the touch, the yong <hi>AEglets</hi> dare looke vpon the Sunne, and that which is eloquent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly polished may abyde the presse. Why then may not your <hi>Iouius</hi> looke any man in the face, hauing arte to direct him, authoritie to defend him, all humanitie to pleade for him. If you misdoubt his grace in the Vniuersitie,
<pb facs="tcp:3275:4"/>
the Muses will giue him their voyces, if the suffrages of the holy virgins in the Courte, they are <hi>Graces</hi> themselues. If onely the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude <hi>Odi profanum vulgus &amp; arceo.</hi> For I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you remember the olde prouerbs: that it is great trouble to make a Couche for a dogge, for that turning himselfe so variably, no man knoweth where to place the Pillowe: and so mutable and vnconstant is the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that it is not for a wise man to indeuour to feeede their humour or fit their fancies. Yet doe not thinke that euery prudent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is like to wanton Mistresse <hi>AEmilia,</hi> who would ordinarily flout the first line she read: or to curious <hi>Gonzaga,</hi> surnamed the Carper, who no sooner heard a pretie inuention, but would recompence it with his gentell girkes: Or to <hi>Theodorus</hi> scollers, which receiued eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing with their left hand, which their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster gaue with the right, or to the <hi>Hidropicus,</hi> who hauing no iudgement of tastes, yet neuer liketh any sawce, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demneth all Cookes. Therefore I would wish you as your frende, neuer to sinotther so sweete inuentions, for feare of Censors, who in words perhaps will debase it, which in deede they conceiue not, and controll that they cannot amende, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther following the counsell of the wise, nor the example of the vertuous.</p>
            <p>There is another point in your last letter, wherein you seeme to marre al that you haue
<pb facs="tcp:3275:4"/>
made, and dash that which so cunningly was deuised. For sooth you blush to open another mans shop, and sell <hi>Italian</hi> wares as though you were a Bankerupt in philosophie, and could not afforde any pritie conceipt without borowing or embeselling. I pray you Syr, shal <hi>Castilio</hi> be more reuerenced for his courtier, then <hi>D. Clarke</hi> admired for inuesting him with so courtlie robes? shall <hi>Menander</hi> be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternized for his <hi>Comedies,</hi> and <hi>Terence</hi> forgot who gaue them credit: Shall <hi>Lambin, Cardan,</hi> and <hi>Scaliger,</hi> and the most excellent Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of nature, <hi>Plinie, Matthiolus</hi> &amp; <hi>Tolet,</hi> shall they be lesse reueréced, for perfecting know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the old Philosophers for a shadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inuention? shal the witte and capacitie of antiquitie sit in her throne, and disposition &amp; iudgement of posteritie keepe the dore: no reason, the one deuised, the other disposed. <hi>Iouius</hi> therefore is bound vnto you, both for absoluting and blazing his inuetions abroad in this famous Iland, and wee are beholding vnto you for reuealing them to vs: wherein truely both arte in translating, &amp; knowledge in iudging, iustly may chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge their fees. You cannot forget that which <hi>Nolanus</hi> (that man of infinite titles among other phantasticall toyes) rruely noted by chaunce in our Schoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, that by the helpe of translations, al Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces had their ofspring, and in my iudgement it is true. The <hi>Hebrewes</hi> hatched knowledge.
<pb facs="tcp:3275:5"/>
               <hi>Greece</hi> did nourish it, <hi>Italie</hi> clothed and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified it, &amp; the artes which were left as wards in their minoritie to the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> by Translators as most carefull Gardiners, are now deduced to perfect age and ripenesse. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the nakednes of your stile (which troubleth you without the colours or florish of <hi>Rhetorique) Tullie</hi> commendeth it, al Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slators approue it: and no man maketh so much acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of the glossoas of the substance: of the gay suie bush as of the wine: Neither could it preiudice you at all (if it were naked as in deede it is pure) because you haue not done it as the <hi>Sybaritae,</hi> that bad their guestes a whole yere before the feast, to make some expectation of a sumptuous banket. A toye would require all brauerie: Vanitie all orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and an Asse had neede of all his trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings. But your argument is such as can both moue and delight, tickle the eare and satisfie the minde. And our time also hath learned to lothe that od riming vaine, and to persecute the letter is cleane out of fashion, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon by a bad portraiture of wit, and is ended by a ripe direction of iudgement. But why doe I rather aunswere the capcious, then sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the graue and modest, who at the first vewe (I dare presume vpon their wisedome) will subscribe to the supremacie of the wit of your newe Science. For if Courtiers are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly rauished in vewing the Picture of <hi>Fia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metta</hi>

Kersey, then a fine Skarlet. My weake commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of these not able and rare inuentions, may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eclipse their credit, then purchase their fame, therefore I referre them to the censure of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate readers, for whose better vnderstand of the <hi>Imprese</hi> of <hi>Paulus Iouius</hi> (who in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces haue erred from the common receiued precepts) I haue gathered into a certayne order the way of framing and composing all such kindes of deuises both militarie and amorous vsed at this day of the noble gentlemen of <hi>Europe,</hi> in adorning their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious triumphes, or declaring their inward preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded purposes and enterprises, not by speach or any apparent maner, but shadowed vnder a certayle vayle of formes or figures in such sort as shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be declared. And although that to signifie our intentions by these formes or figures, of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, be not a thing more notable then speach or writing, which perfectly doe manifest any operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereas the other doth doubtfully discouer our pretences. Yet I say, that to represent vnto the sence of sight the forme or figure of any thing, is more natural in act, &amp; more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to al creatures then is hearing, and thereupon sayth <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that we loue the sence of seeing, for that by it we are taught and made to learne more then by any other of our senses, whereby we see that all men naturally take delight in pictures, and euen litle children as soone as they can vse their hands at libertie, goe with a Cole to the wall, indeuoring to drawe the forme of this thing or that. This naturall disposition hath
<pb facs="tcp:3275:10"/>
raigned generally euen from the beginning when the worde was but yet new, and induced nations first to figure beasts, plants, trees, celestiall signes, and such like, obseruing the nature and qualitie of euery creature represented by their figures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in time they became able to shewe their intent to their frends and others vayled vnder the forme of these creatures, in which facultie the AEgypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were most singulare as the first authors of this <hi>Hieroglyphicall</hi> art: as well do witnesse their sacred Colomnes dedicated to <hi>Mercurie,</hi> whereon were diuers formes and pictures wrought and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen, contayning great knowledge, which they called <hi>Hieroglyphi,</hi> To the which pillers <hi>Plato</hi> is sayde to haue gone and retourned with great profit. Yet notwithstanding, in my opinion their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise was vnperfect, by reason of the diuersitie of the natures of beastes and other things which they fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured. Whereupon they who drewe more neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our time seemeth to haue brought this art to perfection, by adding mots or posies to their sigures whereby they couertly disclose their intent by a more perfect order. Moreouer besides the figuring of things corporall and of visible forme, men haue also represented things incorporal, which they could not doe more fitly then by colours, as representing sorowe by blacke, defire to shed bloud by red, puritie by white, &amp;c. And now sith time hath brought to perfection many notable deuises, which rude anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie could not discerne: Let vs consider by howe many wayes we may discouer our secret intentions
<pb facs="tcp:3275:11"/>
by colours and figures, as first by Liurees, secondly by Ensignes, thirdly by mots, and lastly by Imprese, of which foure kindes of Deuises, I purpose to set downe distinctly in fewe words their significations and properties, according to the opinion of the best authors which euer haue written of this matter.</p>
            <p>This worde <hi>Liuree</hi> is borowed of the Spanishe, which they write with, <hi>b librea,</hi> but pronounce it as written with <hi>v.</hi> Some say it had his <hi>Etemolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giè</hi> of <hi>Libro,</hi> for that <hi>Liurees</hi> are as an ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> booke where a man may reade the intent of him which weareth them. Some also will haue it deriued of <hi>Libero,</hi> and that for two reasons, the one, in that from the beginning it hath beene a profession onely of Gentlemen, and noble personages: and although that seruaunts do commonly weare these <hi>Liurees,</hi> yet are they not said to be their owne but their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones. For <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Solon</hi> saieth, that seruauntes were forbidden any free exercise. The other reason may bce, for that the Authors setting them to the common vewe, being not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether apparent, commit them <hi>libero iudicio,</hi> to the free iudgement of the Interpreter. Some will haue it brought from the Latin, <hi>Liber eram,</hi> for that the principall purpose of <hi>Liurees</hi> haue been to shewe some amorous seruice, and for this onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent were they first inuented at the beginning, to shewe that they which did weare them, were no more free of them selues but subiect seruauntes to their Mistrisses: as who should say, <hi>Liber eram,</hi> I was free, but now bound: according to that of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,

            </p>
            <p>It is said that <hi>Liurees</hi> of only colours, had their originall after this manner: that the Gentlemen which loued or rather (to speake after the <hi>Spanish</hi> or <hi>Neapolitan</hi> manner) which serued any Lady, with that amorous kinde of seruice, which is vsed in those places, were accustomed, to marke with what coloured robe their Mistrisse was inuested, to the end to decke them selues with apparell of the same colour &amp; cut. But some supposing that to be to great a presumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thought rather to addresse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in a habite of the same colour, as did the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticall seruantes of their Ladie, to denouate hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, and shew them selues readic for any seruice commaunded by her soueranitie: Yet now, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers respectes, in this our time the discrete Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men bound to the performance of this strict Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>fecrecie,</hi> haue deuised a closer couert for their amorous conceiptes, by colours and figures in their <hi>Liurees,</hi> which are now more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Deuises,</hi> in all the most florishing Countries of Christendome: which also is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Ariosto,</hi> in these verses following, recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Deuise</hi> of <hi>Bradamante,</hi> whereby she ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed her dispayre, and desire to die.</p>

            <p>There are first, diligently to be obserued in these <hi>Dcuises</hi> or <hi>Liurces</hi> three things: The time when: The place where: and the maner how they are to be vsed. Concerning the time: they are neuer worne but either in true or fained warre, or at Iusts, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neis, Maskes, or at such like extrauagant shewes. The place sit for them, are on armed men or Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, worne in such place as they best like about their persons: albeit the Helmet, the Shiclde, the Bardes, the borders of the garment, or the breast, are the fittest places appointed for them. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of vsing them is diuers, according to their <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:</hi> but first generally you are to obserue this, that they bee not too intricate in greate number, nor so confused that they neede some <hi>Apollo</hi> to resolue them. Perticularly it behoueth to note the deuition
<pb facs="tcp:3275:12"/>
of their <hi>species</hi> which are of al kindes of <hi>Deuises</hi> or <hi>Liurees</hi> sixe. The first consisteth altogether of colours: The second of colours and figures: The third of colours and letters: The fourth of colours figures and letters: The fifth of figures onely: The sixth of figures and letters. Concerning the first colours alone, are now seldome vsed but of Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or such like. As for example, a certaine Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman on a time, hauing ill successe in his amorous feruico, and spending his time in dolor and griefe, was aduertised that the wife of a certaine freende of his was departed this life, whereupon it behoued him to put on mourning apparell: and hauing occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to shewe himselfe at a feast, he clothed him in blacke Grogran drawne out with Taffatie, &amp; both cut on blacke Damaske, in such sorte that the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maske was best seene to bee blackest: which mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning habite was no soner seene of such as knewe the historie of his loue, but they perceiued What it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisied, as well as if he himselfe bad declared it: and greatly did they commend the inuention. For with the vppermost blacke he represented sorowe for the dead: with that vnderneath he mourned for his freend: but his owne blacke appeared more and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified some greater griefe, and that of his frend see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med lesse, and represented lesse in effect. For in his opinion lesse griefe was it to bee depriued of a wife, sith she is called to the heauens, then to stand seclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the fauour of a proude disdainefull dame, whilest an other enioyes the fruite of his desirued affections. But to returne to our purpose, <hi>Liurees</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3275:13"/>
of onely colours, and also with colours and figures are wont to serue in effect, but for the shewe of one day, either at Iusts, Maskes, or other solemne fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiuall sportinges, where are commonly assembled a great multitude of people: and to the end that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and Gentlewomen (which giue the vew but as they passe by, among so great a companie) may not stande to muse about the intention of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, there is vsed a mot to declare the meaning, &amp; these kinde of mots pertayning to <hi>Liurees,</hi> are to bee composed in the same language which is there vsed where they are presented: and it is requisite they bee shorte so that they exceede not two of our verses: very rarely are they made of foure, yet so they may be if neede require. These mots so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed serue for colours alone, or els for colours ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with figures, or with figures alone: and when they shalbe ioyned with colours alone, yet are they called <hi>Liurces,</hi> when with colours, figures and the mot, which shall exceede three wordes being manifest of it selfe and seruing for no other purpose but to declare the signification of the colours and figures, they are likewise then called <hi>Liurees</hi> or <hi>Insegnes,</hi> and as I haue before sayd, they serue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for one day. These last properties rehearsed, that the mot may passe three wordes, and that it must be plaine and manifest, seruing onely to disclose the meaning of the colours and figures: note well, for therein consisteth the difference betweene <hi>Liurees</hi> and <hi>Impreses,</hi> which are altogether diuers. The ignoraunce of which distinction deceiued many in
<pb facs="tcp:3275:13"/>
the composing of <hi>Impreses.</hi> And also <hi>Iouius</hi> him self in his discourses following was greatly ouersene in putting no difference betweene <hi>Impreses, Liu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rees,</hi> and <hi>Insegnes,</hi> as you may plainely perceiue. This worde <hi>Insegne</hi> is taken from the Latin, by the which is signified Standards, Banners, and also the Helmets of the chiefe Souldiers and Captaines, as may appeare in this verse of <hi>Virgil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Danaumque insignia nobis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aptemus Clypeos,</hi> but chiefly it is now taken for Standards or Banners, which are capable of all such properties mentioned before in <hi>Liurees,</hi> as either of colours alone, as when they are all red, all white, all blacke, &amp;c. Or when they are of seuerall colours, as white and red, or in like maner of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. To them also may bee added mots, as many notable men haue vsed of late time: &amp; also colours with figures, or figures alone: all in such maner as hath bene shewne in <hi>Deuises</hi> or <hi>Liurees.</hi> The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe is also fit for <hi>Impreses,</hi> of the which I am hereafter to speake, and many therein set the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of their house: whereof to recite examples this shorte Preface will not afforde, sith ech of them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally require a whole volume. only suffice it, brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that we touch them, to the end we may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnderstande the forme of <hi>Impreses:</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dle, it is necessary that I say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of <hi>Mots,</hi> which truely are of great excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie if they bee gallantly composed. And first this word <hi>mot</hi> signifieth as much as <hi>Gnome,</hi> a shorte sentence or Posie, whose places are diuers. Some
<pb facs="tcp:3275:14"/>
vse to set them on gates, as that which (according to the fiction of the Poet) was set on Hell gate. <hi>Lasciate ogni speranza voi chi intrate.</hi> Lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side all hope, all you which enter in.</p>
            <p>A ridiculous mot or posie is not to be vsed but in some occasion of maskes, or to quip an enemy, as for example, a certaine Cardinal in Rome for some offence being imprisoned, and after put to death, it was bruted abroade, that the Pope had done it to pleasure two of his <hi>Nephewes</hi> with his liuings, wherupon one liuely pictured the sayd Cardinall on the Crosse, and the two yong Cardinals preferred to his liuings, at his feet beholding him with this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie in their hands, <hi>Crucifixus etia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pro nobis.</hi> But the mots which are chiefly vsed, are either amorus or graue, &amp; they beare a great grace if they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>posed with their circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stances &amp; properties, so that they be short, &amp; exceede not if it be possible a verse in any tongue. Yet Latin &amp; Greek verses of six feete are to long to be vsed whole, wherefore of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is better to take a part, as <hi>nullu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> scelus error habebat.</hi> And better are they esteemed being take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of some famos autor. As out of <hi>Ouid, Horace, Catullus</hi> and other Latin <hi>Poets,</hi> out of <hi>Homer, Hesidus, Callimachus,</hi> or any good author of the <hi>Greekes</hi> out of <hi>Petrarch, Deuine Ariosto, Da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te Bembo,</hi> and other famous in the <hi>Italian</hi> to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue, &amp; aboue all, if it be possible, let them leaue some scruple whereon to meditate, to him who either readeth or heares them, and it is lawfull to vse them without figures, although that <hi>Paulus Iouius</hi> vainly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb facs="tcp:3275:14"/>
them so vsed, soules without bodies.</p>
            <p>There is also another kind of <hi>Deuise</hi> called in <hi>Italian, Cifre celate,</hi> which many haue hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vsed being ignorant of <hi>Imprese,</hi> which inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is onely for youth, and very vnfit for men of grauitie, seruing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but to sport with their Ladies, by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uaying their names into some Posie or figure, which they ware in toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their seruice, of this kind you shal find fit examples in <hi>Paulus Iouius,</hi> which I haue noted in the <hi>Margent.</hi> The inuention is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together barraine, and vtterly disliked of the wise.</p>
            <p>Thus hauing briefly touched the principall points of the former <hi>Deuises,</hi> it resteth that I say somewhat of <hi>Impreses,</hi> which is the most notable, ingenious and perfect king of all other. And first to declare the signification of the worde, with the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition, I say, that <hi>Impresa</hi> is vsed of the <hi>Italians</hi> for an enterprise, take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in hand with a firme &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to bring the same to effect. As if a Prince or Captaine taking in hand some enterprise of war, or any other perticulare affaire, desirous by some fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure &amp; mot to manifest to the world his inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, this figure &amp; mot together is called an Impresa, made to signifie an enterprise, wherat a noble mind leueling with the aime of a deepe desire, striues with a stedy inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to gaine the prise of his purpose. For the valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; hautie gentlemen, disdayning to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ioine with the vile and base <hi>Plebeians</hi> in any rustique inuention, haue procured to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues this one most singulare, which time hath now at length perfited and rought into a more regulare order. And the chiefe places
<pb facs="tcp:3275:15"/>
whereo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they vse to weare these their <hi>Impreses</hi> are their <hi>Standards, Shields, Helmets, Brooches, Tablets</hi> or such like. The time when, is either in Warres, Iusts, or amorous seruices. And you are to note, that <hi>Impreses</hi> are not Hereditarie, as are Armes, for the sonne may not vse the <hi>Impresa</hi> of father, nor the successors of their ancestors, and it behoueth that they be of no other colours, saue ono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blacke and white, vnlesse it be rather to adorne them, then for any necessitie, and chiefly in the composing of them, are to be noted these fiue proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. First, that they haue not many kinds of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent formes, for at the most there can be but three, in a perfect <hi>Impresa,</hi> vnlesse they be parts of the whole: as the Sunne, Moone and Starres repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent onely the heauens, which may be the intent of the <hi>Impresa:</hi> or as many trees flowers and herbs, represent onely a Garden. As for example, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne gentleman figured a garden with <hi>Palmes, Bayes, Marigolds</hi> and <hi>Roses,</hi> with this mot. <hi>Tu haec omnia,</hi> to signifie that his mistresse deserued the <hi>Palme</hi> for her beautie, &amp; that she was free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the assalt of <hi>Loue</hi> as is the <hi>Lawrell</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wrath of the heauens, that she drewe the eyes of his mind after her, as doth the Sunne the Marigolde, and that by the vertue of her comfortable lookes she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued his heart, as doe the ioyful beames the blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Rose. But now in any other case diuers formes are not to be vsed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the mot or posie of an <hi>Impresa</hi> may not exceede three words, vnlesse it be composed of
<pb facs="tcp:3275:15"/>
some of these. <hi>Dum. Nec. Et. Non. In. Per. Aut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si. Cum. Vt.</hi> and then may it haue foure, as <hi>Nec spe nec metu.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, that the mot be taken out of some fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous author. This precept is good, but not alwayes necessarie.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that it be not altogether manifest nor too too obscure, neither yet triuiall or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, that the figure without the mot, or the mot without the figure signifie nothing, in respect of the intent of the author, and this precept is of great importance, for many ignorant hereof, haue composed <hi>Imprese</hi> altogether vayne and voyde of all inuention. As when the figure of it selfe or the mot of it selfe, suffice to declare the meaning, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either the one or the other is superfluous. As he which figured a Harte in the middest of fire, with this mot, <hi>Il cuore ho in fuoco.</hi> I haue my Harte in fire, or as he which depainted a <hi>Cupid,</hi> with his Bowe &amp; shafts, &amp; thereunto this verse. <hi>A gli strali d' amor son fatto segno.</hi> To <hi>Cupids</hi> shafts I am ornayned the Butte. Or not vnlike to that of him in <hi>Iouius,</hi> which figured a Chimney with a great fire and smoke, with this mot. <hi>Doue è gran fuoco è gran fumo.</hi> Where there is great fire, there is great smoke, in all which the mot without the figure, or the figure without the mot, might haue serued the purpose as well. But if vnto the fire &amp; smoke had bene added this mot, <hi>Vtru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> simul,</hi> the <hi>Impresa</hi> had beene most perfect. The
<pb facs="tcp:3275:16"/>
like defect had that of <hi>Borgia,</hi> which likewise <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius</hi> doth mention, which was the mountayne <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croceraunii,</hi> wherunto, if in stede of <hi>feriunt sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos fulgura montes</hi> had bene added <hi>Humilio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra minus,</hi> or <hi>humiliora nunquam,</hi> therein had wanted no perfection. <hi>Iouius</hi> also addeth for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the rules of <hi>Imprese,</hi> that in them thcre ought to be no humayne forme, which precept is most true, if it be in the ordinarie and simple forme of a man, for that rarenes is rather delight som: but yet when the humaine forme shalbe in a strange &amp; vnaccustomed maner, it beareth a great grace. As did that of <hi>Sinior Bernabo Adorno,</hi> being ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mored of a noble and vertuous Lady, wbo often certified him both by speach and writing, that the arrowes of loue could not enter or passe farther then her gowne. Whercupon the Gentleman composedan <hi>Impresa</hi> which was a <hi>Cupid,</hi> holding in one hand the vaile of his eyes, and in the other hand an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobuze s<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ttled to his brest, as if he were readie to discharge it, and thereunto this mot. <hi>Hoc pera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get.</hi> To signifie that he had omitted no seruice, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, or loyaltie in his pursute, which are the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maynshotte of Loue, and are able to batter the bulwarke of a rigorous breast, and make the most flintie heart to yeeld.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I in fewe words (gentlemen) declared the properties of a perfect <hi>Impresa,</hi> to the end your choyce therein may be currant, sith many deceiue themselues with a counterfeit. And so wisbing the happie successe of all your vertuous <hi>Impreses</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:3275:16"/>
godly pretences. I referre you to the reading of <hi>Paulus Iouius,</hi> till time my studies shall yeeld you a better present of the like subiect.</p>

            <p>SVch is the curtesy of your highnesse towards mee, that I hold my selfe bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to render an accompt of the vacant leasure, which partly by your louely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations I haue enioyed in these parching and noysome heates of the fierie moneth of August, the enemy of moyst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les old age. And therefore hauing intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my History as a burthen more po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derous, I resorted to take my pleasure in discourse &amp; conference with that vertuous ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tleman Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Lodouico Dominico,</hi> (who also thereunto inuited mee) vpon the inuention of <hi>Imprese,</hi> borne at this day of great and Noble perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages.

my selfe to commend it vnto you, deeming it to bee a meete recreation for so noysome a season.

This tract may well be compared to the diuersitie of the foresayd flowers, both gratefull to the vewe, and pleasaunt to the taste: which also I hope shalbe the rather accepted of you, for that it was brought foorth in your house. And afrer this maner had the argument of our present discourse his beginning. Master <hi>Lodouicus Dominicus</hi> familarly accompanying mee in translating my History into the vulgar <hi>Tuscan</hi> tongue, he happely entred into conference of <hi>Inuentions</hi> and <hi>Imprese,</hi> which worthy gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and noble Knights of our time beare (in token of their gentlemanly minds) vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their Vestments, Shields, Bards, or Ensignes, to whome I answered.</p>

               <p>I yeeld you infinite thankes for such <note place="margin">The originall &amp; beginning of Impreses.</note> an offer, but first tell mee I pray you, whether the bearing of <hi>Imprese</hi> be an auncient vsage or not. There is no doubt but that the au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cients vsed to weare Crestes &amp; Ornaments on their Shields and helmets: which <hi>Virgill</hi> plainly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couereth when he reciteth the Catologue of the nations which came in fauour of <hi>Turnus</hi> against the <hi>Troians</hi> in the eight booke of his <hi>AEne. Amphiraus</hi> also as <hi>Pindarꝰ</hi> reporteth, at the warre of <hi>Thebes</hi> bare <hi>a Dragon</hi> depainted on his shield. <hi>Statius</hi> writeth also of <hi>Capaneus</hi> &amp; <hi>Polinices,</hi> whereof the one bare an <hi>Hidra,</hi> and the other a <hi>Sphinx.</hi> We reade also in <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3275:19"/>
how at the battel of the <hi>Cimbri</hi> semed in shew very gallant, as well for their siluer shining ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, as for the decked Crests of their Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets, wherein were represented the effigies of diuers sauage beastes, depainted after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers fashions. The same author reporteth that <hi>Pompey</hi> the great did beare for his Enseigne a <hi>Lyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> with a sword clasped in his claw. We find also in the remaynes of old antiquities many to haue like signification to our moderne <hi>Impreses,</hi> as appeareth in that of <hi>Vespasianus,</hi> which was a <hi>Dolphin</hi> intangled with an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chore, with this posie: <hi>Festina lentè.</hi> A sentence <note place="margin">Make soft speede.</note> which <hi>Octauianus Augustus</hi> was wont often to vse. But leauing apart these examples of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie: of this the famous <hi>Palladines</hi> of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce can yeld testimony, the which in trueth for the most part were not fayned, and we see, in that wherein the writers agree, that euery one of them had his peculiar <hi>Impresa</hi> or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seigne. As <hi>Orlando</hi> the chesse, <hi>Rinaldo</hi> a <hi>Lion, Denise</hi> a <hi>Ladder: Salomon</hi> of <hi>Bretaigne,</hi> the <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequier: Oliuer</hi> a <hi>Griffon: Astolphe,</hi> a <hi>Leopard: Ganelon</hi> a <hi>Faulcon.</hi> The like wee reade of the Knights of the round Table, of <hi>Arthure</hi> that renoumed King of England. Those which are famosed in the Spanish histories, as in <hi>Amadis de Gaule, Primaleo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Palmerin, &amp; Tirante</hi> vsed the like. And nowe in this later age, in the time of <hi>Federicke</hi> surnamed <hi>Readbeard,</hi> began the age of Ensignes of families, called Armes:
<pb facs="tcp:3275:19"/>
giuen by Princes, in guerdon of honorable exploytes atchieued in the field. Whereupon there grewe such singulare and fantasticall inuentions or Ensignes and Pictures vpon Helmets, to enhaunce the honour of valiant Knights, as may well bee seene by diuers Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the Church of newe Saint Maries at Florence. But now in our time, after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Charles the eight, and Lewes the twelft into Italie, euery one which followed the warre, imitating the French Captaynes, sought to adorne himselfe with goodly &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous <hi>Imprese,</hi> wherewith the troupes of horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men being separated company fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> company, made so resplendent shew, hauing their vpper garments embrodred with siluer, bossed with beaten gold, and in their breast and back the <hi>Imprese</hi> of their Captaines: in so much that the shewe of the men of Armes yeelded a very po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pouse &amp; rich spectacle, &amp; in the battel was tried the couragious force of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies.</p>

to my selfe to become a youth again, wherein the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so much I delighted that it seemed a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage that I should write their historie.

<pb facs="tcp:3275:20"/>
these properties, you shal vnderstand that the body and soule aboue mentioned, is meant either by the mot or by the subiect, and an <hi>Impresa</hi> is accounted vnperfect when the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect <note place="margin">An Imprese imperfect, Duplex. 1.</note> or body beare no proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of meaning to the soule, or the soule to the body. As <hi>Cesar Borgia</hi> Duke of <hi>Valentia</hi> vsed this soule with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a body, <hi>Aut Caesar aut nihil:</hi> Meaning <note place="margin">A soule with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the body.</note> hereby, that he would shewe his manhoode, and make trial of his fortune.

               </p>
               <p>And truely in his greate and prosperous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, the Posie was most wittie and worthie his Nobilitie, if it had bene applied to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned Subiect, as was that of his brother <hi>Don Francesco</hi> Duke of <hi>Candia,</hi> who had for his <hi>Impresa</hi> the Mountaine <hi>Chimera,</hi> or <hi>Acro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceraunes</hi> strike<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the lightning of heauen, with these words out of <hi>Horace: Feriunt sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi>

thereby that his naturall swift running was not sufficient, but that he would flye into euery difficult and daungerous hazarde.

               </p>
               <p>The like defect had the <hi>Impresa</hi> of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die <hi>Hippolita Fioramonda</hi> Marquise of <hi>Scalda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sole,</hi> at <hi>Pauia,</hi> who farre excelled all the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants of our time both in beautie and amou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous curtesie, who often wore in her Sky co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lored Sattin robes, Candleflyes all dispersed, wrought in embrodery of gold, but without a mot, warning thereby the amourous that they approach not too neere her fire, least it

happen to them as it doth to that flye which ventureth so nere the flame that it burneth itself. And being requested of the Lord of <hi>Lesui</hi> (beeing a braue and valiaunt Knight, and at that time a practiser in the arte of Ryding) to manifest vnto him the meaning of this miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: To whom she replied, It is conuenient for me to vse the like curtesie to Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which resorte to see me, as you doe to such as ride in your companie, being accustomed to put vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the tayle of your Coursier a rattle or such like, to make him more fierce in yerking, to warne those which come nere you of the dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his heeles, and to cause them keepe the more aloofe. Yet could not this caueat take place with my Lorde of <hi>Lesui,</hi> but that many yeares after he perseuered in his loue, and at the ende being deadly wounded in the fielde of <hi>Pauia,</hi> he was carried into the house of the Ladie Marquise: where he ended his life with great contentation, yeelding vp his last gaspe betweene the armes of his dearely loued Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strisse and Patronesse, as he vsed to terme her.</p>
               <p>The contrary defect had the mot of the worthie Lawyer Master <hi>Iason di Maino,</hi> who had engrauen ouer the gate of his Pallace this Posie without a bodie, <hi>Uirtuti fortuna comes:</hi> signifying thereby that his vertue had happie fortune.</p>

the body and soule, and yet by meanes of the weake proportion, that the soule hath to the subiect: it becommeth ridiculous &amp; obscure, As that of the Duke <hi>Lorenzo</hi> of <hi>Medici,</hi> which was a Laurell tree betwixt two Lyons, with this mot: <hi>Ita &amp; virtus.</hi> Signifying therby, that as the Laurell is euer florishing, so is vertue neuer fading: but none there were which could tell what the 2.

Some said it represented Fortitude and Clemencie, in that they seemed to parle, their heads be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so closely ioyned together: Others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued it an other waie. At length one Master <hi>Domitius da Cagli,</hi> Chaplaine to the Cardinall of <hi>Medici,</hi> (who was afterward Clement the seuenth, and comming to visite the Duke <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo,</hi> who was sick of a disease wherof short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after he died) aduentured to demaunde of one Master <hi>Philippo Strozzi,</hi> being desirous to vnderstand the secrete of the <hi>Impresa,</hi> inuited thereunto also by the Gentlemans courtesie, sayd: Master <hi>Philippo</hi> you which are so skilfull in learning, and also Cosine and companion of the Duke, shewe me I praie you what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth these Lyons vnder this Laurell tree. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Philippo</hi> looking askance on the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, who although he were a gowned man, yet not so well grounded in learning that his knowledge reached beyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his portois, made him this sharpe and readie aunswere: Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand you not (quoth he) that these Lyons do

garde this Laurel, and defende it from the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of such Poets, which runne mad on a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, hauing heard of the inuesting of the Abbot of <hi>Gaeta,</hi> solemnized in <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; flocke so fast to spoyle her of her braunches, to shew them selues <hi>Laureat?</hi> The Chaplaine replied (who delighted to make certaine Sonnets to runne in dogrell rime) saying, As God helpe me it is done of very enuious malice: seeing that the Pope <hi>Leo</hi> hath curteously made <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reat</hi> the <hi>Abbot Baraballo,</hi> &amp; that he hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him to triumph ouer the <hi>Elephant.</hi> Which thing came to the eares of the Cardinal, who greatly iested at <hi>Domitio</hi> as at a slender Poet, and an vnlearned Chaplaine.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, we must haue regarde that it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre <note place="margin">Not.</note> not the suspition of any great pride or presumption, although both the soule &amp; bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die bee sound and perfect: for it easely disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth the vanitie of the bearer.

<pb facs="tcp:3275:23"/>
 &amp; he himself banished to <hi>Naples</hi> where he ended his life.</p>
               <p>I tell you it were a greate point of folly to <note place="margin">These three which follow are called of the Italians Cifre celate, and not Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prese, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed onely of youth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for graui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as hath bene shewed in the Preface</note> taxe the defects of <hi>Imprese</hi> which are vsed in this age, being composed of the vndiscrete, and borne of mad braines, as was that of the fierce Souldier, (I will not saie Ruffion) <hi>Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stien del Mancino,</hi> (which name was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at that time honorable among Fencers) who vsed to weare on his hat, a shoe sole, with the letter <hi>T.</hi> &amp; a Pearle, which is called <hi>Marg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herita,</hi> in the middest of the sole, thereby to discouer his affection, and his Mistrisse name after this maner: <hi>Margherita Te suola di cuor' amo.</hi>

               <p>The like inuention was that of Master <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine Porco</hi> of <hi>Pauia,</hi> inamoured of the Lady <hi>Biauca Paltiniera:</hi> who to shewe himself her faithfull seruaunt, vsed to weare fastened <note place="margin">BIAVCA sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth white.</note> to his scarlet Bonet, a little Candle of white Waxe, to signifie, by deuiding this word <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dela,</hi> which is in Englishe a Candle, into three

               <p>But much more ridiculous was that of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualier Casio</hi> the <hi>Bolognian</hi> Poet, both for bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery and fine inuention, who wore in his hat, in a greate <hi>Agate</hi> the discention of the holie Ghost vpon the twelue Apostles: and beeing demaunded of Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> with whom he was very familiare, wherefore he wore this Doue, representing the holy Ghost, and the fierie tongues vppon the heades of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, he answered, Not for any deuotion, but to expresse a conceipt of loue. For hauing bene of a long time inamored of a Ladie, and vngratfully handled of her, not able any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to support her craftie delaies, nor the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences bestowed on presentes and giftes, I fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured the Feast of <hi>Penticost:</hi> meaning, I repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the cost bestowed of my Ladie.

               <p>There were also in au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient time, some wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Personages which wanting the inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of such like subiects supplied it with mots of their owne phantasies, which became very ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, as when they were to long.

               </p>
               <p>The like fault of length had that of the Prince of <hi>Salerua,</hi> who builded the sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pallace in <hi>Naples,</hi> on a Pinnacle: whereof in the fore front he erected a paire of hornes with this mot:

George on hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe within a white Shielde, parted with a red crosse: the King by chaunce in gathering vp a garter from the ground, gaue occasion to a certaine Ladie whose garter it was, to murmur at it. Wherefore it pleased him in the honor of that Ladie, to ordaine that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Knight of the Order, which were wont to be sixe and twentie, should weare for an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe about their legge the Garter with this inscription, <hi>Honni soit qui mal y pense.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now returning to our time more enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with singulare wittes, I saie that those Kings which of late haue bene, haue aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them selues both in their warly enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, &amp; also in the brauerie of their ornaments of <hi>Imprese,</hi> aboue the honour of their aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors. And to begin with that of <hi>Lewes</hi> the twelft, King of Fraunce, which seemeth to all men, both of singulare beautie in shewe, and also of excellent sharpnesse in sence, for that it fitted the noble nature of that Martiall Prince, whom no toyle of Warre could euer tire, who with an inuincible minde caused to bee worne on the vpper garments of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of his Garde, a Hedghogge crowned, which pricketh those, that come neere to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy it, &amp; casteth most sharp thornes at those which stande farther of: signifying thereby that his forces were readie nere at hand and
<pb facs="tcp:3275:26"/>
also abroad. On which subiect I remember to haue seene this mot, <hi>Comminus &amp; eminus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing inferiour to that of <hi>Lewes,</hi> was the <hi>Impresa</hi> which his successor and Sonne in lawe Fraunces the first vsed to beare, who as his slipperie youth did leade him, chaunged the manly exploites of warre, with the weake pleasures and effeminate delights of his fond loue. And to signifie that he fried in these passionat flames, wherein so much he gloried that he shamed not to saie, that he nourished <note place="margin">Inourishe my self.</note> himselfe in them. Whereupon he wore the <hi>Salamander</hi> in the flaming fire, with this mot, <hi>Mi nutrisco:</hi> being the proper qualitie of this beast to purge all her cold humors amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the burning coales: wherby it commeth to passe that she feareth not the force of the fire, but rather te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perateth the heate thereof, or put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it out. And trueth it was that this he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicall and curteouse King was neuer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a loue, being notwithstanding zelous in affecting, and liberall in rewarding the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and of courage valiaunt, against all the iniquities of Fortune (as the <hi>Salamander,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the force of the fire) in all chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, and warly euents: and this inuention was forged with the stampe of his owne braine.</p>
               <p>Also that of his Sonne and successor King <hi>Henry,</hi> is in all points comparable to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued to beare the same <hi>Impresa,</hi> which whilome he made beeing <hi>Daulphin:</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3275:27"/>
which was the Moone Cressant, with this braue mot carying great sence: <hi>Donec totum impleat orbem.</hi> Signifying thereby, that vntill he amounted to the inheritance of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, he could not manifest his inward va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure, as the Moone ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not yeeld her full light, vntill she come to her perfect greatnes. And of this his noble mind the recouering of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne,</hi> and many other whorthy acts (which I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talie can witnes) doe yeeld sufficient testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. Wherefore at the earnest request of Sir <hi>Mortier</hi> the French Embassadour, after the death of Frauncis his father, I figured a full Moone al round, with this mot: <hi>Cum plena est, sit Emula Solis,</hi> shewing that shee had so great brightnesse, that she equalled the sonne, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the nights as cleare as the dayes. The king also meant hereby to yeeld some thing to the honour of a Lady vnder the name of <hi>Diana,</hi> who was accounted of the Auncients, the same goddesse with the Moone.</p>

Some men were of the opinion, that it sprung from the subtile inuention of <hi>Antonio Nibrissa,</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent learned man, who is said to reuiue the latine tongue in Spayne. But to say the trueth (although that many notable <hi>Imprese</hi> haue sprung from the worthy witttes of the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, as was that which <hi>Don Diego</hi> of <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dozza,</hi> a valiant and honorable knight, did vse to weare in the warres of the great Capitaine
<pb facs="tcp:3275:28"/>
                  <hi>Consaluo Ferrante.</hi> Yet there haue bene some very vayne, and voyde of all such properties as they ought to haue, as was that of the knight of the house of <hi>Porres,</hi> who being ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mored of a Gentlewoman attendant on the Queene <hi>Isabell,</hi> whose name was <hi>Anna,</hi> and fearing that she should marry with a certaine other knight farre richer then himselfe, who fought to winne her from him: he therefore counsayling her that she should remayne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant in her loue towards him, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descende in any case to the other, he wore on his Crest depainted a Ducke, which in Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish is called <hi>Annadino,</hi> which name deuided into sillables, is after this maner, <hi>Anna dino.</hi> As much to say, as Anne say no.</p>
               <p>Like vnto this also was that of <hi>Don Diego</hi> of <hi>Guzman,</hi> who hauing receiued a discourte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous countenance at the hands of his Mistres: wore in a triumphe at Iusts, a great bush of greene Mallowes: to denotate thereby that his loue went a crosse: for <hi>Malua</hi> in Spanishe is the herbe Mallowe, and beeing distinctly written, <hi>Mal va,</hi> is as much to say, as it goeth ill, the affayres of my loue haue no good fuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.</p>

               <p>These here agree well with those ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous inuentions of the white Candle, and of Penticost.

               <p>Yea, and peraduenture the onely one among those which are exstant, not only in Spayne, but els where. And this it was, that hauing sounded the ford of his Mistris phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and finding the wharfe of her good will very difficult to ariue at: being driuen into dolorous affections, and as it were desperate, inuented a wheele with buckets which draw vp water, and then cast it forth againe: And for that half the buckets are full receiuing in the water, &amp; half are emptie casting it forth, he adioined this mot,* <hi>Los llenos de dolor y, Los vazios de speranza.</hi>

               <p>Worthie of Commendation was also the <hi>Impresa</hi> of <hi>S. Antonio da leua:</hi> who beeing by reason of the Goute caried in his Chaire, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed this mot to be worne of his Captaine, set on the trappings and ornaments of his horse, <hi>Sic vos non vobis:</hi> at such time as Charles the fift was crowned in <hi>Bologna,</hi> and the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Millan</hi> restored to <hi>Francesco Sforzae.</hi> And the mot was without a bodie, which if it had not, there could not haue bin a better. For that therby he seemed to shew, that how
<pb facs="tcp:3275:29"/>
by his vertue and manhood the state of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> was gotten and preserued, and after resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Duke by the Emperour, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to retaine it to himself, contrary to the order of the league, as he had done before.</p>
               <p>And because I am to prosecute the order of the Nobilitie, I wil recite vnto you the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prese</hi> of the fower last Kings of <hi>Aragona:</hi> and amongst other what the opened Booke doth signifie, being the <hi>Impresa</hi> of <hi>Alphonsus:</hi> which hauing no soule of any mot at all, caused ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to doubt of the signification. And for that the King was of incomparable knowledge, as well in feates of Armes as faculties of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and also excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the practise of ciuile gouernment: some sayd one thing, and some another: but most me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thought he ment ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that libertie was the most precious thing that a man might haue, and therefore he him self as most prudent, neuer tooke any to wife, therby not to make him seruant to his owne choyce. Some sayd he bare the Booke to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie that the perfection of the intelligence of man, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisted in the knowledge of the Scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and liberall Arts, in the which he himself was very studious. But to let passe the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of this Booke, I saie that <hi>Ferrante</hi> his Sonne bare a worthie <hi>Impresa,</hi> which began vpon the rebellion of <hi>Marino di Marciano</hi> Duke of <hi>Sessa,</hi> and Prince of <hi>Rossana,</hi> who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were Cosin to the King, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb facs="tcp:3275:29"/>
did confederate with Duke Iohn of <hi>Augio,</hi> to procure the death of his Lord and King being at Parliament: but by meane of his hardinesle and noble courage, the treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous purpose could take no effect. The histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of this eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t remaineth engrauen in Brasse on the gate of <hi>Castel nuouo.</hi> And after a time <hi>Marino</hi> being taken &amp; cast into prison, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued with himself not to put him to death: saying, that he would not embrue his handes in the blood of his owne kindred, (albeit he were vngratefull) contrary to the expectation &amp; will of many his freends, and Counsailers: and in token of this his noble mynd and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie, he figured an <hi>Armelui</hi> compassed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with a bancke of dung, with this mot, <hi>Malo mori quam foedari:</hi> being the proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Armelui</hi> rather to perishe by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirst, then by escaping through the mire to defile her self, and spot the polished white of her precious skin.</p>
               <p>That also of <hi>Alphonsus</hi> the second his Sonne was braue, but very extrauagant, as being composed of sillables of the Spanish tongue. And it was after this maner, that the daie drawing nere of the battell of <hi>Campo Merio,</hi> against the <hi>Velletri,</hi> to exhorte his Captaines &amp; Souldiers, depainted in his Standard three diadems of Saincts ioyned together, with this worde <hi>Valer</hi> in the middest, to signifie that that day they ought to shewe their manhood
<pb facs="tcp:3275:30"/>
aboue all other: pronouncing it after the Spanish maner, <hi>Dia dc mas valer:</hi> a day of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter valure.</p>
               <p>Right notable in trueth was that of <hi>Feran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dino</hi> his Sonne, who being induced with these noble and Princely qualities, liberalitie and clemencie, and to shewe that these qualities were of nature &amp; not arte: he figured a mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of <hi>Dyamants,</hi> which growe all as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of them selues, as if they were fashioned by workmanship and arte: hauing this mot, <hi>Naturae non artis opus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither was that lesse commendable of King <hi>Federicke</hi> Vncle to <hi>Ferandino,</hi> who suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him in his Kingdome (being by the spareles <hi>Parcae,</hi> depriued of life) &amp; taking pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the Kingdome, beeing weakened with the late warres, &amp; enfeeblished with the factions of those of <hi>Aniou,</hi> to assure the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of the contrary parte of his fauour, he did beare figured in forme, a Booke of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptes, with leather stringes and buckles, after the maner of the Bankers bookes, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the title 1485. &amp; represented flames of fire to arise by the margents of the Booke being closed, with a mot of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: which was this, <hi>Recedant vetera.</hi> To shew by this his worrhie inuention, that he pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned all men their misdeedes and offences for that yeare. And herein he immitated the auncient <hi>Athenians</hi> which made the lawe of
<pb facs="tcp:3275:30"/>
                  <hi>Amnestia:</hi> which signifieth obliuion or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting all which is past. Yet this did little profite the good King <hi>Federicke.</hi> For within fiue yeres by the vnpreuented conspiracie of <hi>Ferdinando</hi> King of Spaine, with <hi>Lewes</hi> the 12. of Fraunce, he was enforced to abandon his Kingdome, and leaue it to these two Kinges, who deuided it amongst them.</p>
               <p>There were other Princes of Italie and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Captaines, who delighted to shew their conceiptes in <hi>Imprese,</hi> &amp; such deuises, amongst the which, was worthely esteemed that of <hi>Francesco Sforza</hi> Duke of <hi>Millan</hi> (at that time wherein these sharpe inuentions were not so rife) who hauing taken possession of the state, by meanes of the right of his wife, <hi>Madonna Biauca Viscont,</hi> and by force of Armes apeased all troubles, caused to be embrodered on his Coate armour, a Mastiffe or Greyhou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d crou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching on his hinder legges, &amp; standing vp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, vnder a Pine tree, with this mot, <hi>Quietu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nemo impune laccsset,</hi> to signifie that he would not molest any man, but that he was readie to offend, and defend himself, if any dared to oppose them selues against him: whereof he made triall against the <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobilitie, (whiles he held quiet the King <hi>Renato</hi> of <hi>Prouince</hi>) in repressing the greedie desire which they seemed to haue of that state.</p>
               <p>Very like vnto the former deuise in beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, was the obscure <hi>Impresa</hi> of <hi>Galeazzo</hi> his
<pb facs="tcp:3275:31"/>
Sonne and Successor, which was a Lyon with an Helmet on his head, sitting on a great fire. Very fayre was the picture to the vewe, but yet reputed without a good inuention, being without a mot, and hardly vnderstoode of the author himselfe: wherefore I will not straine me with the repeating of the diuers interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which were giuen of many, whereof some were vayne and ridiculous.</p>
               <p>But yet very learned and of a gallant shew, was that of his brother Duke <hi>Lodouico</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though too too presumptuous) who was, for the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men had of his wisdome, on a time chosen the Iudge and arbiter of the Peace &amp; Warre of Italie, &amp; thereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he bare the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery tree, (called in Italian <hi>Celso moro</hi>) for his <hi>Impresa:</hi> which as <hi>Plinie</hi> saith, is accounted <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientissima omnium arborum,</hi> because it bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth late, to auoyde the pinching frosts, and ripeneth her fruit very soone. As who should say, he knewe by his wisdome, what fortune the future times would bring. But his wit fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him when he called the French men into Italie, to warre against the King <hi>Alphonsus</hi> his deadly enemy, which were after the cause of ruine: and so became his great wisedome to derision, ending his life, imprisoned in the Towre of <hi>Loches</hi> in Fraunce, a fit example of the misery and vaine glory of man.</p>
               <p>Hee caused him selfe also to be surnamed <hi>Moro.</hi> And when he passed the streetes, a man
<pb facs="tcp:3275:31"/>
might here the voice of children and appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices crying aloude, <hi>Moro, Moro:</hi> And conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in his like vanities, he caused to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paynted in the Castle, Italie in the forme of a Queene, inuested with a golden robe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were embrodered all the chiefe Cities of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talie, according to their right semblance: and before her standing a wayting blacke <hi>More,</hi> with a Brush in his hand. Whereat on a time the Ambassadour of <hi>Florence</hi> merueiling, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of the Duke, to what ende serued this blacke Page which brushed the robe and the cities. To whome the Duke answered, To cleanse them from all filth, to giue him to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that the <hi>More</hi> was iudge of Italie, to order her as he thought good. Nowe the sharp witted Florentine perceiuing his drift, sayd, Take heede Sir that this <hi>More</hi> brush not so long, that he brush al the dust on him selfe: wherein he foretold the trueth. And here you are to note that many thinke that this <hi>Lodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uico</hi> was called <hi>Moro,</hi> for his browne skinne and blacke face, but they are deceiued, for ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was he of a white &amp; pale co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plexion, then in any part black as we our selues haue seene.</p>
               <p>But that excelleth not onely the <hi>Imprese</hi> of the Princes of Italy, but also those of the house of the <hi>Medici,</hi> his predecessors, which Iohn the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Medicis</hi> inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward was Pope <hi>Leo</hi> being restored vnto <hi>Florence,</hi> by the force and power of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyards,
<pb facs="tcp:3275:32"/>
hauing bene before eightene yeres in exile. His <hi>Impresa</hi> was a yoke, which Oxen vse to beare, and the mot <hi>Suaue,</hi> signifying there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that he was not returned to tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nise ouer his country, nor to reuenge the iniuries done him of his enemies, and factious citizens: But rather to shewe that his gouernment shoulde be gentle with al clemencie, with the mot out of the scripture answerable to his Priestly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, taken out of this place: <hi>Iugum meum suaue est, &amp; onus meum leue.</hi> And truely it was very congruent to his nature, and proceeded from the sharpnes of his own learned wit: although it seemed that the yoke came first from the great <hi>Cosimo,</hi> who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was recalled to his country from exile, figured the cittie <hi>Florence</hi> fitting on a Chayre, with a yoke vnder her feete: to shew thereby as it were that saying of <hi>Cicero, Roma patrem patriae Ciccronem libera dixit,</hi> and for the excellencie hereof, it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to be worne vnto the time of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> and merited to be instamped in the coyne of <hi>Florence.</hi>

But to tell you the trueth, although with all dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce I haue searched, yet ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not I find pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely what they signifie, &amp; thereof also doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Pope <hi>Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,</hi> who in his meaner fortune, lay also in the selfe same chamber.</p>
               <p>And trueth it is that he sayd, the <hi>Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co Lorenzo</hi> vsed one of them with greate bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie, inserting it betweene three feathers of three sundrie colours, greene, white, and red: which betokened three vertues, Faith, Hope, and Charitie, appropriate to those three co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours: Hope, greene: Faith, white: Charitie, red, with this worde, <hi>Semper,</hi> belowe it. Which <hi>Impresa</hi> hath bene vsed of all the successors of his house, yea, and of the Pope: who did beare it imbrodered on the vpper garments of the horsmen of his garde, vnder that of the yoke.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Magnifico Pietro,</hi> Sonne of <hi>Cosimo,</hi> did beare a Faulco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a Diamond in her talent, And the same was vsed also of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> and Pope <hi>Clement</hi> likewise, with this mot <hi>Semper,</hi> applied to the title of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which the Popes professe, although it bee, as is aboue sayde, a foolish thing to compose mots of sillables, or single words. The <hi>Magnifico</hi> woulde haue to bee vnderstoode hereby, that euery thing ought to be done to the will and pleasure of God, and the better doth it fit this purpose,
<pb facs="tcp:3275:33"/>
for that the Diamant is of so inuincible forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude both against the fire and stroke of the Hammer: as was most miraculously this <hi>Magnifico,</hi> against the conspiracies and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries of M. <hi>Luca Pitti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Magnifico Pietro,</hi> Sonne of <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> as a youth and inamored, vsed to beare for his <hi>Impresa,</hi> great Billets of greene wood, set one vpon the other, which seemed to cast forth flames and smoke from the fire within, signifying that his enflamed affection, was the more vehement, for that the wood wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it burned, was yet greene. And this was the inuention of that learned man <hi>Angelus Politianus,</hi> who made thereunto a mot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning this latin verse:
<q>
                     <l>In viridi teneras exurit flamma medullas.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Magnifico Iulian</hi> his brother, a man of good nature and excellent witte, who was afterward Duke of <hi>Nemors,</hi> hauing taken to wife the Neece of the King of Fraunce, Sister to the Duke of <hi>Sauoi,</hi> to shewe that fortune which was so many yeres aduerse vnto him, now began to turne her fauour towards him, he caused to bee set in a shield of triangular forme, this word of sixe letters, <hi>GLOVIS:</hi> which turning backward, you may read <hi>SI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VOLG.</hi> And because it was iudged obscure <note place="margin">It turneth.</note> and vayne in sence, many of his affectioned seruantes, interpreted euery letter seuerally by it selfe, whereby arose as many diuersities
<pb facs="tcp:3275:33"/>
of opinions, as did among them in the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Basile,</hi> who interpreted the name of <hi>Pope Foelix:</hi> saying, <hi>Faelix id est salsus eremita lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dificator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And because we haue aboue spoken of the <hi>Imprese</hi> of <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> it shal not be amisse, to say somewhat of that of <hi>Pope Clement,</hi> which wee see depainted in euery place, and was inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of <hi>Dominico Boninsegni Florentine</hi> his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorer, who searched the secrets of nature, and fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that the Sunne beames passing through a peece of Christall, beeing so strengthened through their vniting, according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Prospectiue,</hi> that they burne euery obiect, sauing only things passing white. And <hi>Pope Clement</hi> willing to shewe to the worlde that the puritie of his minde, could not bee contamined, by the malicious, neither by any force, vsed this <hi>Imprese:</hi> when his Enemies in the time of <hi>Adrian,</hi> fought to bereaue him both of life and dignitie, which conspiracie thei brought to no effect. The <hi>Impresa</hi> became very notable and renowmed, because therein were all thinges which might make faire ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance to adorne it, which were these: a rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d peece of Christall, the Sunne with his beames passing through, the flame proued by them, all set in a white hood, with this mot, <hi>Candor illesus.</hi> Yet for all this, was it very obscure to those-which knewe not the propertie aboue sayd. Wherefore it needed that wee his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts
<pb facs="tcp:3275:34"/>
should to each man desirous to know the same expoúded, and make manifest what <hi>Boninsegni</hi> and the Pope ment thereby: which obscuritie ought to be shunned in an <hi>Imprese,</hi> as is before declared. And it was the more intricate for that the mot was deuided by sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables, as this, <hi>Can dor ille sus.</hi> One Master <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Schiauone</hi> Chaplaine to the Pope, who had no more learning then would serue him to mumble vp a Masse, all meruelling at the Posie, demaunded of me, what the deuill, the Pope ment thereby, which as he thought ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to no purpose: For (quoth he) <hi>ille sus</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, that Sowe: and repeting it oftentimes, <hi>ille,</hi> is that, &amp; <hi>sus,</hi> is sure a Sowe, as I haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Grammer Schoole at <hi>Sebenico,</hi> and therefore must it needes be that Sowe. Vpon this arose great laughter, &amp; the matter came to the Popes eare, who gaue aduertisement not to deride it by letters to auoyde the like errors of <hi>Amphibologia,</hi> committed by such foolishe interpreters.</p>
               <p>That also of <hi>Hippolito</hi> Cardinall of <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> although it was very goodly both in shew and substance, yet had it some defect: for that none could throughly vnderstand it saue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the learned, &amp; such as were very well seene in the Poems of <hi>Horace:</hi> for being desirous to signifie that the Ladie <hi>Iulia Gonzaga,</hi> excelled in beautie all other women, (which is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to our age, who for her chast condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb facs="tcp:3275:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>

The common people thought this Starre to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, that the soule of <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie of the immortall Gods: which was the occasion that <hi>Augustus</hi> placed the signe of this Commet on the top of the Stal<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                     <l>Micat inter omnes Iulium sydus</l>

               <p>After the death of the Cardinall the Duke <hi>Alexander,</hi> hauing maried <hi>Margherit</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi> daughter to the Emperour, and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Florence</hi> with equale iustice agreeable to the citizens: seeing himselfe gallant and able of person, was desirous to make himselfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noumed by the warres, saying, that to get glory and in taking the Emperours part, hee would couragiously enter into euery difficult and dangerous enterprise: resolute in this, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to win honour with praise, or lose his life in perill. And hereupon on a day earnestly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested mee to deuise him some notable <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presa</hi> to weare on his cote Armor. And I chose

him out the wild beast <hi>Rhinoceros,</hi> the deadly enemy of the <hi>Elephant,</hi> which being sent to Rome by <hi>Emanuel</hi> King of <hi>Portugals,</hi> who fought with it, comming by <hi>Prouince</hi> where it was seen being ariued on the land, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward drowned by hard fortune, amongst the rocks a litle aboue <hi>Porto Venere,</hi> (for it was not possible that such a beast could saue it self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chayned, albeit it swam miraculously a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the sharp rocks, which are all alog that coste) yet notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding there was brought to Rome, his true portrature, and greatnes in February 1515 with information of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: the which as <hi>Plinie</hi> saith, and the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals</hi> affirme, is to goe and finde the <hi>Elephant,</hi> and assaulting him, striketh him vnder the panch with a hard and sharpe horne which it hath growing on his snout, neither doth hee euer depart from his enemy. nor from sight, til he hath weried and slaine him, which most often falleth out: vnles the <hi>Elephant</hi> with his long snout doe take him by the throte, and in closing doe strangle him. The forme of this beast in goodly embrodery serued for the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerture of his <hi>Barbarie</hi> horses: which ran in Rome for the price or masterie, with this mot in the Spanigh tongue: <hi>No buelle sin vincer:</hi> I <note place="margin">I warre not but I won.</note> retourne not without victory, according to this verse, <hi>Rhinoceros nunquam victus ab hoste cedit.</hi> This deuise pleased him so that he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it to be engrauen in his brest plate.</p>

               <p>In trueth I sawe many the day of his mariage, which seemed to issue from worthy wittes, Whereof one aboue all pleased me, for that it was fitly applyed to his highnes, who hauing <hi>Capricornus</hi> for his <hi>Ascendent,</hi> as also <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> as witnesseth <hi>Suetonius.</hi> And therefore caused the Image thereof to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stamped in his Coyne.

And it seemed a thing fatall, that the Duke <hi>Cosimo</hi> the same day of the <hi>Calends</hi> of August, wherein <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> obtayned the victory ouer <hi>Antontus</hi> and <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra</hi> at the promontory <hi>Atticum,</hi> the same day he discomfited and tooke his enimyes on the mountayne <hi>Murlo.</hi> But this <hi>Capricornus</hi> hauing no Posie: I adioyned thereunto this mot: <hi>Fidem fati virtute sequemur.</hi> To this sence I wil striue with mine owne vertue, to archiue that, which the <hi>Horoscopus</hi> doth promise me.

               <p>Well, sith it is your pleasure, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to begin with the valian<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t troupe of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, which you haue sene renowmed in our historie. And me seemeth that the honor of Rome requireth of desert that we begin with the Romaines, because they haue in effecte borne awaie the mainprise of picked Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, as the inheritors of the auncient vertue of their Countrey. Amongst whom in my daies the two principal Famelies, chief of the auncient Facton <hi>Guelfa</hi> and <hi>Gebellina,</hi> which were called <hi>Vrsini</hi> and <hi>Colonesi,</hi> haue had each of them two most renowmed: The Famely of <hi>Vrsina</hi> had <hi>Verginio</hi> and <hi>Nicolo:</hi> the <hi>Colonesi, Prospero,</hi> and <hi>Fabritio. Verginio,</hi> in authoritie, riches, multitude of Souldiers, &amp; in the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of his house, being Captaine of all the Primates of <hi>Italie,</hi> ascended to the tipe of Dignitie: from which againe he fell, after the comming of King Charles into <hi>Italie,</hi> being taken with the Earle of <hi>Pitigliano</hi> at <hi>Nola</hi> by the French men, deceiued by the promise of the <hi>Nolans</hi> and by <hi>Lewes d' Arsio</hi> the French
<pb facs="tcp:3275:37"/>
Captaine, and was kept prisoner vntill the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious vprore hapned in the French Campe at <hi>Tarro,</hi> wherein he finely escaped the hands of those which garded him, being as then bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied about greater matters. Now the <hi>Colonesi</hi> being vnder the conduct of the Cardinall <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canio Sforza,</hi> who at the beginning serued the French men: and being made a newe league betweene the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> they retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the seruice of the King <hi>Ferandino, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spero</hi> first, and then <hi>Fabritio,</hi> vowing themselfe <hi>Aragonians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verginio</hi> also was inuited to go serue the same King, being offered a great pay, and to be recompenced with offices of honour and dignitie, as to be high Constable, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was afterward geuen to S. <hi>Fabritio,</hi> with the gouernment of <hi>Abruzzo Alba,</hi> and <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliacozzo:</hi> but he iudging it not beseeming his honour, wilfully condiscended to the French, and rather accepted of their pay: although therein the <hi>Vrsini</hi> vtterly disliked his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, because it might be preiudiciall to the honour and state of Italie, which then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan againe to conspire against Fraunce, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring least it should become subiect to so puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant a nation. But he hardened with a fatale obstinacie, addressed himselfe with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Captaynes of the same conspiracie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst king <hi>Ferandine:</hi> answering those which disswaded him to the contrarie (as the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
<pb facs="tcp:3275:38"/>
of the Pope, of the Duke <hi>Lodouico,</hi> and of the Lordes of <hi>Venice,</hi> who shewed him the daunger hee wilfully cast himselfe into, and therewithall willed him to waigh what great rewardes and benefites were offered him) sayd, I am like vnto the Camell, whose nature is this, that comming to a cleare riuer, drinks not of the water vntill first hee hath fouled it by trampling with his feete.

               <p>The Earle of <hi>Pitigliano,</hi> being in pay with the Lords of <hi>Venice,</hi> in the warres of <hi>Lombar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi> had for his <hi>Impresa</hi> a coller of Iron, called in Latin <hi>Millus,</hi> set ful of sharpe prickes, as we see about the necke of the Sheepheards Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiues to defende them from the biting of the Wolues, with this mot, <hi>Sauciat &amp; defendit</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit this <hi>Impresa</hi> is to be seene at this daie at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Pallace of <hi>Nicosia</hi> in possession of the <hi>S. ors</hi> of the house of <hi>Vrsina:</hi> and in the middest of this coller is this Posie, <hi>Prius mori quam fidem fallere:</hi> there also are figured two handes, which seeming to take holde of the Coller, are pearced with the sharpe prickes which are set thereupon: and in the middest
<pb facs="tcp:3275:38"/>
there is depainted a Rose.</p>
               <p>To the other former <hi>Imprese</hi> are nothing inferiour those of the other two Brethren the <hi>Colonesi, Prespero</hi> and <hi>Fabritio,</hi> who at diuers times had sondry inuentions: some Militarie, and some amorous, according to their phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies.

               </p>
               <p>He also did beare an other, very commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, which was the Touchstone, with this mot, <hi>Fides hoc vno, virtusque probantur:</hi> to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte that his vertue &amp; faith should of al men bee knowne by touch and triall.

               <p>In the same warre <hi>Marc' Antonio Columne</hi> Nephewe to <hi>Prospero,</hi> who lay in garrison de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Citie <hi>Rauenna,</hi> where he worthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behaued himself against the violent rage &amp; terrible battery of <hi>Mouris de fois,</hi> had a bowe of Palme wrethed with a bow of Cipres, with this mot, <hi>ERIT ALTERA MER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CES:</hi> Meaning that he went to the warres either to winne victorie or loose his life.

<pb facs="tcp:3275:39"/>
the Cipresse worne at Funeralles. This man had all the giftes which either nature or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune might bestow, to make a man singulare.</p>
               <p>The same <hi>Marc' Antonio</hi> wore also an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the warres of <hi>Mirandola</hi> and <hi>Bologna,</hi> wherein the Cardinal of <hi>Pauia</hi> was Legate, of nature proude and imperious, and the loftie minded Romaine not yeelding to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but would execute euery duetie which pertayned to the warres himself, the rather for that he perceiued the Cardinall to vse dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honest dealing with the Duke of <hi>Vrbin,</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was after slaine of him. To manifest his noble minde he vsed for his <hi>Impresa</hi> the <hi>Heron,</hi> which bird in the time of raine flyeth so hie aboue the Cloudes, that she escapeth the wett, to the ende it may not fall on her back, and yet naturally vseth to bathe her in the little streames, content to haue the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnder her, but not that it should fal vpon her. The <hi>Impresa</hi> was very delightsome to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde: for besides the braue shewe of the bird, there was figured the Sunne aboue the Cloudes, the birde betweene the Sunne and the Cloudes, in the middle region where raine and hayle are ingendred, belowe were Marish groundes with Sedge &amp; other greene hearbes, but aboue all it was adorned with this goodly mot about the necke of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, Natura dictante feror.</hi>

(as one which greatly delighted in these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious inuentions) in the warres of <hi>Verona:</hi> which Citie was valiauntly defended by his manhoode, against the force of both the French and Venetian Campes, which was a vesture in the middest of the fire, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witstanding burned not, as made of that Lint of <hi>India,</hi> which <hi>Plinic</hi> called <hi>Albestin,</hi> which maie bee purged from spots in the fire &amp; not consumed, and it had this mot, <hi>Semper perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax.</hi>

Their <hi>Impresa</hi> was to signifie, that although they were persecuted by hard fortune, and their former power so greatly abated, yet liued they, and in hope that when these boysterous stormes were past, they should againe haue to reioyce: and this it was: Certaine Bulrushes figured in the middest of a Riuer, whose na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is to bowe &amp; not to breake, neither with the violence of waue nor winde, &amp; their mot was, <hi>Flectimur non frangimur vndis.</hi>

               <p>But first hearken to that which <hi>S. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolomeo Aluiano,</hi> a Captaine stoute &amp; valiaunt, but very vnfortunate, vsed to beare on his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe. He was a great defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der of <hi>Vrsina</hi> factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: he manfully ouercame <hi>Bracciano,</hi> the Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Pope <hi>Alexander:</hi> And tooke <hi>Viterbiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all which tooke part with <hi>Iohn Gatto</hi> (in
<pb facs="tcp:3275:41"/>
fauour of the <hi>Maganzesi</hi>) saying they were the pestilent venome of the Citie: and after the death of this <hi>Iohn Gatto</hi> their Captayne, he bare in his ensigne an Vnicorn, whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie is to haue power against poyson, figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a fountayne all inuironed with Todes &amp; Serpents, and the Vnicorne putting in his horne into the Riuer before hee drinke, to purge the venome, with this mot about his necke, <hi>Venona pello.</hi> The same Ensigne was lost in the Battle of <hi>Vincentia,</hi> after that this <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiano</hi> had a great space defended him against the fury of his enemy: <hi>Marc' Antonio da mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> holding it in his armes, and neuer leauing it, vntill he fell downe dead.</p>
               <p>For the same <hi>Aluiano</hi> was composed also another <hi>Impresa,</hi> by <hi>Cotta</hi> of <hi>Verona</hi> his Poet, after the sacking of <hi>Vincentia,</hi> whereof it was sayde the Purueyour or Paymayster Master <hi>Andreo Loredan,</hi> was the principal cause, who at that instant when the <hi>Cesarian</hi> enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put to flight, run armed with this brest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate of Crimsin Veluet, into the Pauillion of the Generall, and sinding him sitting at the Table with many other captaynes, consulting what were best to bee done: he began to lay before them their cowardise, and long linge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, in not pursuing the Enemie: Albeit they were of this minde, that the enemies which slye ought to haue a bridge of siluer. But he with greate instancie vrged them that they
<pb facs="tcp:3275:41"/>
should not so suffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to escape their hands, considering that they had alreadie turned their backes. By the braue and furious words of this <hi>Loridano,</hi> were many incensed to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue them: and by that meanes were the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> ouercome, and <hi>Loridano</hi> left dead in the fielde, receiuing the iust penaltie of his rashe attempt. Whereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Cotta</hi> exhorted his Lord, that in stead of the Vnicorne that he had lost in that Battel, to beare in his Ensigne a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the middest of certaine Swannes, with this briefe about his necke: <hi>Obstrepuit inter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lores:</hi> to signifie that it was vnfit and ill besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that a Senator with a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g gowne should presume to iudge of warlike affayres among Captaines. But this deuise <hi>Aluiano</hi> refused, (albeit greatly commending it) for that he would not seeme to scorne the sayd <hi>Loridano</hi> being dead, in comparing him to a Gander.</p>
               <p>Now will I speake of others, renowmed with the fame and glorie, which they by their worthie deedes haue atchiued: amongst who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I reckon as chiefe <hi>Francesco Gonzago</hi> Lorde of <hi>Mantua,</hi> who became most famous in the Battell at <hi>Tarro,</hi> and by the Conquest which he got ouer the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> for the King <hi>Ferandino.</hi> This <hi>Gonzaga</hi> being of mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious enuie accused before the <hi>Venetian</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, for whom he was Captaine general: and after he had iustified himself, he vsed for his <hi>Impresa</hi> a Furnace wherein golde is tried, set
<pb facs="tcp:3275:42"/>
on the fire, with certaine stemmes of golde therein, with this Posie out of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: <hi>Brobasti me Domine, &amp; cognouisti</hi> willing also, <hi>Sessionem mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> following in the same sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to be vnderstoode. His slaunderous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers obiected, that he coueted to sit on two seates, that is to say, serue the <hi>Venetians</hi> in the warres, and also <hi>Lodouico Sforza</hi> his brother in law, in taking the aduauntage of the time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Battell, ceasing to pursue the French men halfe conquered, in which case he neuer offended, for it was all forged by the <hi>Earle Gaiazzo,</hi> to pleasure the French men, and in dispight of the Duke <hi>Lodouico,</hi> for <hi>Gaiazzo</hi> desired not to see the <hi>Venetian</hi> Lordes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querers: to the ende, that if the French men had bene ouercome, they had not so victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously haue gone to occupie the state of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> of them-desired euer since the time of Duke <hi>Phillip</hi> and his father.</p>
               <p>Amongst all the famous Captaines, the Lorde <hi>Giouan, Giacopo Triuultio,</hi> was of soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine wit, and in great reputation, who from the beginning as an Enemie to the Duke <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douico Sforza,</hi> seeing him seeke the vsurping of the Dukedome, which was the right of his Nephewe, he ioyned with the King of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gona</hi> open Enemie to <hi>Lodouico,</hi> for the same cause. And to signifie that in the gouernment of his Countrey he was not to yeeld one iote to him: he bare for his <hi>Impresa</hi> a quadret of
<pb facs="tcp:3275:42"/>
Marble, with a stile of Iron pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, opposite to the Sunne, which was the an<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Ensigne of his house, with this mot, <hi>No<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cedit vmbra soli:</hi> Although the Sunne turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout neuer so often the stile alwaies yeeldeth his shadowe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alphonso</hi> Duke of <hi>Ferara,</hi> a Captaine of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Prowesse and admirable constancie, when he went to the Batell of <hi>Rauenna,</hi> did beare a Globe or round boule of mettle, full within of artificiall fire, which powred forth flames by certaine creueis, and it was so cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly contriued, that at due time and place the fire would issue forth, making great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of those, which were within the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger thereof. The inuention wanted a Posie which was afterwardes added by the famous <hi>Aristo,</hi> and it was <hi>Loco &amp; tempore:</hi> and then tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slated into French to giue it a better shew after this maner, <hi>A lieu é temps.</hi> Valiaunt did <note place="margin">In place and time.</note> he shewe himself in this bloodie battell, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his Artillarie in such sorte, that he slewe much people.</p>
               <p>After that by the death of <hi>Pope Leo,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Vrbin</hi> had recouered his estate, being reconciled with the <hi>Baglioni,</hi> and in frendship with the Cardinall of <hi>Medicis,</hi> who at that time gouerned the state of <hi>Florence,</hi> was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained generall for that common wealth. And on a time Master <hi>Thomas Maufrede</hi> his Embassadour, requested mee to deuise some
<pb facs="tcp:3275:43"/>
                  <hi>Impresa</hi> for his Standard: whereupon I caused to be figured a Palme, hauing the top therof weighed downe with the heauie poize of a great Marble tied thereunto, to signifie that which <hi>Plinie</hi> saith of the saide tree, being of this nature that it returneth to the former fashion be it depressed with neuer so greate a waight, mounting it vp in time, and drawing it on high: adding therunto this mot, <hi>Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taresurgit:</hi> alluding to the vertue of the Duke, which neuer had beene oppressed, though sometimes by the fury of Fortune for a time abased. This inuention pleased him well, and he ordained that it should be set on his Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard: albeit vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> certaine occurrents he came not to take the office of Generall.</p>

               <p>In trueth I haue made many in my time, but I shame to recount the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, sith there are some which haue those defects which are peculiare to humaine actions.

being accompted learned.

               <p>I shall now recount those which shall be perfectly good, sith heretofore wee haue bene shewed such as haue bene ridiculous: and to prosecute our purpose I say, that the <hi>Impresa</hi> of S. <hi>Ottauiano Fregoso</hi> at the warres of <hi>Bolona &amp; Modena,</hi> was accounted ingenious, but very extrauigant considering the picture: for he wore a great many Ciphers <hi>Sables</hi> in a field: Or in the borders of the vtter part of the Bards of his horses. Which Charecters of them selues, in the art of numbring signifie nothing, but hauing a figure of number set
<pb facs="tcp:3275:44"/>
before them, they make a multitude almost infinite: as for example placing but an vnite before the said Ciphers, they signifie a <hi>Million Millions.</hi> Aboue the border was written this. <hi>Hoc per se nihil est, sed si minimu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> addideres maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum fiet:</hi> Signifying that with a little ayde he should recouer the State of <hi>Genoua,</hi> which whilom was in the possession of <hi>Signior Pietro</hi> his father, who there was slaine, &amp; this <hi>Signior Ottauiano</hi> at that time banished, little at all ayded by the Duke of <hi>Vrbin:</hi> but yet of suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient hope to bee restored to his house, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he was by <hi>Pope Leo.</hi> Trueth it is that the Posie is to to long, but yet the nature of the wittie subiect doth beare it singular wel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Signior Hierosin Adorno,</hi> who tooke <hi>Genoua,</hi> by the force and stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of the <hi>Cesarians,</hi> and chased from thence the foresaid <hi>Signior Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goso,</hi> for that he making himself of Fraunce, gaue ouer the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Dukedome, reseruing but only that title of Gouernour. This <hi>Adorno</hi> was a youth of singulare hope, and adorned with great vertnes: but enuious death too sone cut of his desired life: he, as it is the slipperie nature of that fraile age, was ardently inamoured of a Ladie decked with notable beautie, and adorned with rare cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity: &amp; on a time he requested me to inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t an <hi>Impresa</hi> to this tenor: how that he thought and verely beleeued, that the obtayning of her fauour would be the attayning of his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie:
<pb facs="tcp:3275:44"/>
&amp; contrarywise, the losing of the same the bereauing of his life, in yeelding to him a desired death to ende the tedious trauailes which he had sustained, either in the pursutes of loue or practises of warre: which I hearing there came to my remembraunce that which <hi>Iutius Obsequeus</hi> wrighteth in his Booke <hi>da prodigijs.</hi> The lightning to bee of this nature, that comming after greate trauailes and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces, it will make an ende of them, but du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of happie fortune it bringeth damage, ruine or death: and so I figured the lightning of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> after that forme as we see it in antique Monuments, with this briefe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, <hi>Expiabit aut obruct.</hi> The last parte of which Posie he shortly after verified, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this life in <hi>Venice,</hi> where he sat chief Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour for the Emperour.</p>
               <p>But sith we are entred to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies of <hi>Genoua,</hi> I will rehearse three of myne owne which I made at the request of two Gentlemen of the house of <hi>Flisca, Sinibaldo, &amp; Ottobuono,</hi> whereof one was to signifie the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, which they had of the death of their Brother <hi>Girolamo,</hi> cruelly murdered by the <hi>Fregosi</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>petitors of the state: for the which these lost their liues, <hi>Zaccaria Fregoso, S. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gosino, Lodouico,</hi> and <hi>Guido:</hi> which rouenge did something recomforte them for the losse of their Brother: saying, that their enemies had not much whereof to vaunt, in vsing such
<pb facs="tcp:3275:45"/>
crueltie against them: being a thing not vsual among the <hi>Fregosi, Adorni,</hi> and <hi>Flischi,</hi> to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue their handes in the blood of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine enemies, but a thing lawful to contend for the principalitie in ciuile contention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, or els in open warre. I ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore figured an Elephant assalted of a Drago<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who twinding about the legges of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, is wont by his venemous byting to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyson his belly, wherewith he dieth. But the Elephant by nature knowing the daunger, trayleth him along the grounde till he come to some stone or blocke, whereunto leaning himself he rubbeth there against the Dragon that he dieth. The deuise had a goodly shew, and the mot did sufficiently bewray the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification thereof: which was in Spanishe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this maner, <hi>Non vos alabereis:</hi> to shewe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Fregosi,</hi> that they had not to boast of <note place="margin">You neede not boast.</note> the vilanie committed against their blood.</p>
               <p>I also composed another for the <hi>Flischi</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this occasion: They being in conference and consulting to take the Emperours part, and to ioyne with the <hi>Adorni:</hi> whereupon many which were affectioned vnto them and also their seruaunts, aduised them not hastely to resolue them on this enterprise: for that the forces of the King of Fraunce were great, and that <hi>S. Ottauino Fregoso</hi> had got them on his side, and had set firme footing in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, and therefore was well prouided
<pb facs="tcp:3275:45"/>
to defende himself against any which should offer him the onset, at that time: To who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they replied, that they knewe how and when to put in practise such exploites. And vpon this they demaunded me some <hi>Impresa,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently there came to my remembraunce that which <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth of the <hi>Alcions,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine birdes, which by instinct of nature, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <hi>Solstitium vernale,</hi> as most commodious for them, knowing the iust time when the calme season, and quiet seas shall bee, which duelie hapneth once in the yeare, and is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of the common sorte S. Martins Sommer, in which season the sayde <hi>Alcions</hi> build their nestes, lay their Egges, and hatch their yong in the middest of the Seas, hauing happie lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure by the quiet calme. Wherefore the daies wherein the <hi>Alcion</hi> breedeth are called <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionides.</hi> I caused then to bee figured a cleere Skie, with a calme Sea, &amp; thereon a nest, from the middest to either ende somewhat reared vp of some high, with the neckes of the birds looking ouer the prowe being of merueilous straunge colours, as azure, red, white, greene, and yealowe, with this mot aboue them in French, <hi>Nous sçauous bien le temps:</hi> as much to say, as we knowe well the time, when we haue to giue the onset on our enemies. And so it happely sell out that they returned to their possessions reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged on their aduersaries, with the good <hi>Augure</hi> of these <hi>Alcion</hi> birds. This
<pb facs="tcp:3275:46"/>
deuise was depainted in many places of their stately Pallace at <hi>Viola,</hi> before it was by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique edict ruined.</p>
               <p>I made also an other which peraduenture may better like you, for <hi>Sinibaldo Flischo,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a matter of loue, which began now to florishe in wanton peace, after the restles toyles of warre. For this <hi>Sinibaldo</hi> seruing a Ladie, who began to enter into some suspitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of him, seeing him, euery where to frequent other gallant Dames, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the Gentlemen of <hi>Genoua,</hi> whereof she sharply oftentimes reproued him, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playning of his vnpure and corrupted faith. Whereupon, he desirous to clere himselfe of that suspition, requested mee to inuent some pretie deuise concerning his case. And I figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him a Needle touched with an Adamant, applied to a Sea carde with a Compasse ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, and aboue the cleere azure Skie with Starres, with this mot, <hi>ASPICIT V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAM:</hi> To shewe that although in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens were very many faire Starres, yet there was but one regarded of the Adamant, which is onely the Pole starre: and so he reconciled himself with his Mistrisse, whom he entirely loued. And albeit he sported with others, yet was it not in earnest, but rather to couer his faithful affection, vnder the vaile of a preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed loue.</p>

               <p>There commeth now to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce one of <hi>S. Gion Paule Baglione,</hi> a man of greate wisedome and expert in feates of Armes, very affable and of such courtly elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as they vse in the <hi>Perugian</hi> to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue, but yet passing subtile and craftie, hauing aspired to bee (as it were) Tyrant of <hi>Perugia,</hi> and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerner of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Campe. Howbeit, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had it bin for him, to haue kept him quiet with honor at home in his Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trcy: for <hi>Pope Leo</hi> (prouoked by the infinite complaintes, made by the chiefe of the famelie of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glioni</hi>) trayned him to <hi>Rome,</hi> by smoth entrca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whether whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he came he cut of his head.

               <p>I remember also an other which I made
<pb facs="tcp:3275:47"/>
for <hi>Girolamo Mattei</hi> a <hi>Romayne</hi> Captayne of the Horsemen pertayning to the Garde of <hi>Pope Clement,</hi> a man of noble courage: who hauing with great patience, perseuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and dissembling, attended a time to slay <hi>Girolamo,</hi> the Nephewe of the Cardinall of <hi>Valle,</hi> to the end to reuenge the death of <hi>Paluzzo</hi> his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by him cruelly murdred in a ciuile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. And hauing requested me to find him some <hi>Impresa</hi> to this sence: that a noble minde hath powre to digest with time euery greeuous iniurie. And I figured for him an <hi>Austritch</hi> deuouring an Horsenaile, with this mot. <hi>Spiritus durissima coquit.</hi> So much was his notable reuenge commended, that his very enemy of the house of <hi>Ualle</hi> accepted of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, cancelling all cause of iarres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the two famelies, and the <hi>Pope Clement</hi> pardoned the homicide, and made him cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Austritch</hi> also serued me, by reason of the diuersitie of her nature, and her diuers properties, for a nother deuise, which I had for my Lord the Marquesse of <hi>Uasto,</hi> at such time as the <hi>Emperour</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> assembled at <hi>Bologna,</hi> and consulted of the affayres of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talie:</hi> where was made Captaine of the league, for the defence of all estates, and the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of peace <hi>Antonio da Leua,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre rather seemed to appertayne to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse then to him. But <hi>Pope Clement</hi> displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb facs="tcp:3275:47"/>
for some dammages receiued by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish <hi>Fauteric</hi> in <hi>Piacentino</hi> and <hi>Parmegiano,</hi> where the Souldiers liuing at their own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure (the Marquise not restrayning their ouer great libertie) pillaged almost al the country, whereof the <hi>Pope</hi> would be reuenged in hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring his dignitie, which thing the Marquise taking greeuously, complayned of the <hi>Pope</hi> in this maner: I may repent me that I was not at the sacking of <hi>Rome,</hi> when I departed and left my Souldiers, and like a true <hi>Italian</hi> refused to be Captayne. For I could not bee present at the iniuries and damages done to the <hi>Pope.</hi> Whereupon on a day as I recomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him he sayd vnto me: were it not that I had bene ayded by myne owne deserts, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne to be Generall of this inuincible band of footmen, it had not fayled but some had put in their foote before me. And thereupon willed me to make him some <hi>Impresa,</hi> and me seemed that the <hi>Austritch Cursant</hi> made ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much to his purpose, who as <hi>Plinie</hi> saith, is accustomed to vse her Winges as Sayles, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling in swiftnes of running all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And albeit Nature hath giuen her Wings, yet hath she not the vse of them as haue other birds. And vnto this <hi>Austritch</hi> I added this mot. <hi>Si sursum non efferor alijs, sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem cursu praeteruehor omnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Also I gaue the proportion of the same birde to the Earle <hi>Pietro Nauarro,</hi> when by
<pb facs="tcp:3275:48"/>
the capitulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of peace, he was deliuered our of the prison of <hi>Castell Nuouo,</hi> and came to <hi>Rome,</hi> where I began with him to haue very strinct familiaritie, thereby to be informed of diuers poyntes concerning my Historie touching humaine affayres which I was then to write, wherein he curteously satisfied me, as one most couetous of his honour.</p>
               <p>And hauing recounted all his victories and misfortunes, he requested of mee an <hi>Impresa</hi> vppon certaine subiectes which I liked not: whereunto I replied. Sir, you neede not seeke farther then your owne noble deedes for an <hi>Impresa:</hi> for I hauing made you renowmed in my historie, as the glorious inuenter of that admirable and supernaturall arte of Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining, which shall immortalize your name: as there where you caused most miraculously the Castle of <hi>Ouo</hi> at <hi>Naples</hi> to bee blowne vp into the aire: I would not haue you part from this, being a thing which hath purchased vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you surpassing honour and singulare repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Whercupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he confessing it to be true, aunswered me: I praie see if you can finde me one to this effect. Then came there to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce that which some write of the <hi>Austritch,</hi> which doth not hatch her Egges as doe other birdes by couering on them, but doth accomplishe it with the effectuall raies of her eyes. So I figured the <hi>Austritch</hi> Male and Female, stedfastly looking vppon their
<pb facs="tcp:3275:48"/>
Egges with the raies passing from their eyes to their Egges, with this mot, <hi>Diuersa ab illis virtute valemus.</hi> Expressing therby the renou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med commendation of his wit in the inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Vndermining, which with the viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the fire, is in effect equall to the infernall Furies.

like a Gentleman or worthie the name of a <hi>Spartan,</hi> to bee caried dead in his Target to his house, according to the auncient vsage of <hi>Greece:</hi> which thing <hi>Virgill</hi> seemeth to note in this verse: <hi>Impositum scuto refirunt pallanta frequentes:</hi> which also may be gathered by the wordes of the famous <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Battell wounded to death, and caried forth by his Souldiers, earnestly demaunded whether his Target were saued, and aunswere being made, that it was, hee euen in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of death shewed some signe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing.</p>
               <p>The French Captaines haue beene much delighted in Militarie and amourous <hi>Imprest,</hi> amongst whom, the best renoumed, and who deserued to be soueraigne at Armes, was the Lorde of <hi>Trimouille,</hi> who being Conquerer in the Battel of S. <hi>Aulbin</hi> in <hi>Bretaigne,</hi> where was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prisoner the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> which after was King <hi>Lewes:</hi> had for his <hi>Impresa</hi> a whoele with this mot, <hi>Sans point sortir hors de l'orniere:</hi>

               </p>
               <p>There was also among the chief Captaines
<pb facs="tcp:3275:49"/>
which came into Italie famous and renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>Lewes</hi> of <hi>Luxembourg</hi> of the race of the Emperour <hi>Henry,</hi> who died at <hi>Bonconuento,</hi> whose Sepulture you saw in the great Church at <hi>Pisa.</hi> It was this <hi>Lewes,</hi> to whom the Duke <hi>Lodouico Ssorza,</hi> yeelded himself being betra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed by the <hi>Suissers</hi> at <hi>Nouara,</hi> hoping to haue by him or by his meanes some comforte in his calamitie. He (to come to our purpose) had for his <hi>Impresa</hi> a Sunne, <hi>Or,</hi> in a fielde <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure,</hi> inuironed with thick Cloudes, with this mot, <hi>Obstantia nubila soluet:</hi> to inferre that he hauing endured diuers aduersities, after the beheading of his Father the high Constable of Fraunce, hoped notwithstanding that by his valure and vertue, that euen as the Sunne with his skalding beames dissolues the Clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, so should hee vanquishe all that was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse to his shining vertues.</p>

               <p>The foresayde inuention to many seemed good: but notable in my conceipt was that of <hi>Francesco Sensauerino</hi> Earle of <hi>Gaiaza,</hi> who in emulation of his Brother <hi>Galeazzo</hi> at the comming of the French men into Italie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the Duke <hi>Lodouico,</hi> and ioyned with them, not without breach of his honor: for that such a departure caried some suspect.

               <p>The Countie of <hi>Metalone,</hi> the Generall
<pb facs="tcp:3275:52"/>
of King <hi>Ferandino,</hi> had for his deuise <hi>Romaine</hi> Ballance, with this mot of the holy scripture, <hi>Hoc fac &amp; viues:</hi> which seemed very extraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, for that the Ballance serueth to waigh many things: and it was skorned by <hi>Mons. di Persi</hi> Brother to <hi>Mons. d' Alegria,</hi> who disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting the <hi>Aragonian</hi> Campe at <hi>Eboli</hi> got the Ensigne of the Generall, and sayd: in good faithe my Enemie hath not obserued that which was written about his Ballace: for that he hath not well waighed his forces with mine.</p>
               <p>And sith we are entred among the <hi>Neapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans,</hi> whose Princes seeme to degenerate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their auncesters in not going to the warres, which I think is because the honors and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities due vnto them are giuen to straungers: yet I say there wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth not men of the second forme, both noble and valiaunt, who by their valure aspire to honour: Amongst whom is <hi>Signior Giou Baptista Castaldo,</hi> famous for a thousand freshe and notable experiences, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing General of the Campe of <hi>Charles</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, obtayning great praise for his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises at <hi>Germanie,</hi> amounting to the honour of Liutenaunt and Captaine for the King of the <hi>Romaines</hi> in the affayres of <hi>Transiluania</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Turkes</hi> and the <hi>Valacchi.</hi> This <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staldo,</hi> all the time that the whole warres en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, against the French men in <hi>Piemoat,</hi> he would not be there, seeing that the Marquise
<pb facs="tcp:3275:52"/>
of <hi>Vasto</hi> did distribute al the honorable Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to ill experienced Souldiers, and therfore liued aloofe at <hi>Millan:</hi> declaring that the Marquise did worke thinges against nature, to make all Nations to wonder at his disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly dealing. And thereupon willed me to compose him some <hi>Impresa,</hi> and I figured him the Mount <hi>AEtna of Sicilia,</hi> whose top bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth casting out violent flames of fire, and a little belowe hath the grounde all couered with Snow, not farre from that a vastie place full of burnt and consumed stones, and at the foote thereof lyeth a most pleasaunt &amp; fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full soyle: adding thereunto this mot, <hi>Natura maiora facit:</hi> Alluding to the disorder of the Marquise in bestowing the honours of the fielde.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Iou.</speaker>
               <p>There is among other, that of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and neuer sufficiently commended Lady the Marquise of <hi>Piscara, Vittoria Colonna,</hi> to whom I accompt my selfe infinitly bound, as I haue shewed to the worlde in the life of her inuincible Spouse, the Lorde Marquise of <hi>Piscara.</hi> This Lady, albeit she lead a chast and
<pb facs="tcp:3275:53"/>
sober life, vertuous and liberall towards eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man. Yet there wanted not enuious and malignant persons, which did molest and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbe her well disposed mynd. But co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forting her selfe with this: that they which though to harme her, hurt them selues: which proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued most true by diuers reasons which are not here to be vttered. Therfore I figured her certayne Rockes standing in the middest of a turbulent Sea, beating against them with boysterous waues: with this brise added a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue it. <hi>Conantia frangere frangunt.</hi> As much to say, that the Rocks of their firme force and strength, repell the furious surges of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Sea, breaking and consuming them into froth. And this <hi>Impresa</hi> bearing a gallant shew I caused to be figured in my house.</p>
               <p>And sith we are entred to speake of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, I will also shewe you another which I made for the Lady Marquise of <hi>Uasto, Maria d'Aragone.</hi> Who was wont to say, that as she her selfe made singulare acount of her honor and chastitie, so not onely would she preserue it in her owne person, but also take great care that none of her gentlewomen and feruants should, rechlesly corrupted, transgresse the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of honestie. And thereupon set downe a straight order in her house, to remoue all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions both from her men and women, of seeking to defile themselues or their honour. And therefore I made her that <hi>Impresa</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:3275:53"/>
you so greatly commended in my Gallery, which is two bundels of rype <hi>Millet,</hi> bound together with this mot. <hi>Seruari &amp; seruare meu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> est.</hi> For the <hi>Millet</hi> is of such nature, that not only it gardes it selfe from al corruption, but also preserues other thinges from putrifying which lye neere it, as the <hi>Rubarbe</hi> and <hi>Caufire:</hi> which precious things the <hi>Apothicaries</hi> keepe in boxes full of <hi>Millet,</hi> to the ende they may not be consumed.</p>

               <p>I am gladde that you are discended from Captaynes to treat of Women: which also is the more pertinent to the purpose, for that these two were the wiues of most hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable knights.</p>

               <p>Hereupon I call to mynde a beautiful dame, the loue of <hi>Odelto diffois,</hi> called <hi>Monsig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di Lutrec,</hi> who on a time merely sporting with him sayd, that he was noble and valiant, but too too prowde, wherein peraduenture she tould the trueth. For when diuers of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chest <hi>Seigneurs</hi> of <hi>Millan</hi> came in the morning to his house to salute him, without putting of his Bonnet, or with any other gesture of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie or humanitie, hardly would he dayne to shewe them a merry countenaunce, which thing brought him into reproche and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt with the Nobilitie of <hi>Milan.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon he tooke occasion (in steede of a Cowe, <hi>Gueles</hi> with Bees, the auncient Armes of his house) to figure a large Chimney, and therein
<pb facs="tcp:3275:54"/>
a great fire, with this mot <hi>Dou' è gran fuoco è gran fumo.</hi> To inferre an answere to the Lady, that where there is a fiery courage ioyned with Nobilitie, there must also be a great smoke of pryde: Wherefore it is necessarie, that great estates, take especiall regard that they commit nothing to cause them to bee hated of the common people, as was <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro Triuulsio,</hi> who hauing bin long a complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning among the French men, and <hi>Aragoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in the kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> was esteemed wise and politique, rather for speaking litle in Counsailes and assemblies, then for combat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Skirmishes, he bare for his deuise only fiue yeares of corne, without any mot, being a man litle liberall either in hospitalitie or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding Souldiers, and of small curtesie in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres of peace, which brought him into dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayne with the <hi>Uenetian</hi> Lords, for when he was generall, that they determined to change him for <hi>Marc' Antonio Colonno.</hi> And therfore Master <hi>Andre G: itti,</hi> puruoyer of the campe, vouchsafed to bestowe on him a bitter bob after the conflict of <hi>Bicocea:</hi> saying, our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall goeth very ill prouided for victuals, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying but the prouision of fiue eares of corne with him, to whome replied Master <hi>Caesar Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> his Standard bearer, a gentleman of <hi>Milan:</hi> meruayle not thereat Sinior pouruoyer, for that our Captaine liueth with a thin diet, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out to credit, and after payeth himselfe
<pb facs="tcp:3275:54"/>
with ready coyne. But these corne eares of <hi>Theodoro</hi> reduce to my memorie, a deuise which I made for the Marquise of <hi>Uasto,</hi> whé after the death of <hi>Antonio da Leua,</hi> he was chosen Generall for the Emperour Charles the fifth, saying that he had scarce ended the toyle and trauayles which he had induted in attayning the Captayneship of the Fauterie, but that newe cause of troubles began to spring, the chardge thereof being almost vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable. Thereupon, conformable to his purpose I figured him two Sheues of rype Corne with this briefe. <hi>Finiunt pariter reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uántque labores.</hi> Signifying therby, that scarce is the corne fully ripe, but that the Plowmans restles toyle is renued, againe prouiding for another Haruest, and the rather was this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the subiect of the Marquise, for that his great grandfather <hi>Don Roderico d' A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualos,</hi> high Constable of <hi>Castile</hi> did beare the Sheffe of corne which he wan in Battayle.</p>
               <p>Also not long before he had an other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table deuise inuented by Master <hi>Gualtier Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bct Senate</hi> of <hi>Milan,</hi> vpon certayne talke had with the sayde Marquise, who greatly desired to be generall (as afterward he was) that hee might wholy shew his valour, without hauing his deserued prayse communicated with the other Captayne which was in authoritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue him, saying that he had prooued, that many of his owne exploytes, in feates of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
<pb facs="tcp:3275:55"/>
were attributed either to the Marquise of <hi>Piscara,</hi> or els to <hi>Sinior Prospero,</hi> or <hi>Antonio da Leua:</hi> and that now he hoped, sith he was freed from a compagnion, to manifest to the whole world what he could doe in the arte Militarie. And herupon Master <hi>Gualtier</hi> figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Spheres</hi> of the foure Elements sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: with this mot aboue them. <hi>Discretis sua virtus inest.</hi> As much to say, that the <hi>Spheres</hi> in their proper places haue their peculiare ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, whereunto, notwithstanding, a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher will not yeeld, for that the Element of fire in his own proper sphere doth not burne, but onely when it is mixed with other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but for that it had fayre apparence it went for currant, being set on the banners of of the Trompetters.</p>
               <p>This Marquise had also another concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a matter of loue, inuented by <hi>Antonio E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picuro,</hi> a learned man in the Vniuersitie of <hi>Naples:</hi> The which was the Temple of <hi>Iuno Lacina</hi> figured, borne vp with Pillers, and therein an altar with flaming fire, which with no winds could euer be blowne out, and yet the Temple was on euery side open, all the space betweene the pillers, thereby to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie to the Lady whome he serued (and who long time had loued him, and now greeued seeing her self, as she thought, abandoned of him, wherein notwithstanding she was decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) that the fire of his loue was eternall and
<pb facs="tcp:3275:55"/>
vnquenchable, as was that on the altar of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Lacina.</hi> And the inscription it selfe of the Temple engrauen on the Pillars, serued in steade of a mot. <hi>Iunoni Lucinae dicatum.</hi> This deuice also beares a fayre shewe, but it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth some man of skill to declare the Historie to those which knowe it not.</p>
               <p>Also that <hi>Impresa</hi> was somwhat loftie of <hi>Lodouico GonZaga,</hi> called for his brauery <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domanto,</hi> who the same day that Charles the fifth visited <hi>Mantua,</hi> wore in his Cote of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Satin all embrodered with squares of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers colours, one represented a Scorpion, and the other this mot. <hi>Qui viuens laedit morte me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur:</hi> being the nature of a Scorpion to cure her venemous infection, being killed &amp; layed to the wounde. Thereby to signifie that he had slayne him which presumed to offend him, and had cured the hurt of the offence with the death of his enemy.</p>
               <p>The same <hi>Lodouico Gonzaga</hi> had also an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Imprese</hi> farre better, and it happened vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Being ariued with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Campe to assalt Rome, betweene the gate <hi>Aurelia,</hi> and <hi>Settimiana,</hi> tooke the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbes of S. <hi>Peters,</hi> through the courage of his Souldiers. Whereupon Rome being misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly sacked by Germaines, Spanyards and Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, which tooke the Emperours parte: he said, that the Souldier is to haue renowme, as his guerdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, be it good or bad. As if he should
<pb facs="tcp:3275:56"/>
say, although the taking of Rome, and the spoyle therof was abominable to euery good natured Italian, yet notwithstanding did he thinke it would make him famous: and vpon this he had figured the sumptuouse Temple of <hi>Diana Ephesia,</hi> which being burned by one desirous of fame, (not regarding whether it were good or bad) by destroying the most gorgious Monument of the earth: who ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore became so despightfully loathed of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> that they neuer vsed his name, so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable an act had he committed: his Posie therunto was, <hi>Alterutra clarescere fama:</hi> which I after added, misliking this which he had before, <hi>Siue bonum, siue malum, fama est.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I composed also another for the Marquise of <hi>Vasto:</hi> who had intelligence that his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in their tents and lodgings presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously talked, saying with great iolitie that the Marquise might well giue the assault to this or that Forte, or skirmish with displaied En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes at the first and least occasion, or bende his force against such or such a Castle, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them selues to bee very skilfull and of great hardinesse in their loftie wordes, yea, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding their Captain as one which lay idle. But the Marquise sayd, such men, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hapned the point of daunger, and neede re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to shewe their prowesse, would then keepe quiet both their handes and their ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, when as he should enter the fielde with
<pb facs="tcp:3275:56"/>
sword in hand. And to expresse this his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, I depainted him that Mechanicall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, which hath many clackes set on a wheele, which make a great ratling, and is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to bee set in stead of Belles to call to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine seruice on the holidaies during the time that it is darke, as commonly is vsed in Italie, at the time of the death of our Sauiour, when the Belles are not to be rong, the stead wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the noise of this Instrument supplieth, and truely it beareth a pleasaunt and phantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call shewe, hauing this mot, <hi>Cum crepitat, sono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra silent:</hi> to meane thereby that when needful occasion should serue, and the Marquise with glittering Armour were entering into daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, these pretended venturers would trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with feare, shewing them selues not aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to their brauery vsed in wordes.</p>
               <p>I may not passe ouer in silence the Esten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of the Earle of <hi>Santafiore,</hi> which he bare in the Battell of <hi>Seruia,</hi> which was poudred with Quinces, being the auncient Armes of <hi>Signior Sforza da Cotignola,</hi> by right line his great Grandfather, and amongst the Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces was this mot, <hi>Fragrantia durant Herculea collect a manu:</hi> to signifie that the Quinces ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by the hande of so noble a Captaine, endured yet, yeelding a sweete odour: allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Hercules,</hi> who gathered the like fruit in the Westerne gardens <hi>Hesperides.</hi> The field was <hi>Gueles</hi> and the Quinces <hi>Or.</hi>

The foresayde Lorde had quickly some inkling of this matter, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uéture by the Lady herselfe (for <hi>quis bene cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerit ignem</hi>) who by her inconsiderate gestures and semblances vnwarily discouered her tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported loue.

               <p>After the death of <hi>Ascanio,</hi> and the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of S. <hi>George,</hi> there succeeded <hi>Lodouico</hi> of <hi>Aragon</hi> and <hi>Sigismondo Gonzaga,</hi> who repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them selues to haue created <hi>Pope Leo:</hi> the one of them, to wit the Cardinall of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> wore a white tablet with this mot about it, <hi>Melior fortuna notabit:</hi> and the other, <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaga</hi> bare a <hi>Crocodile,</hi> with this briefe, <hi>Crocodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li lachrymae:</hi> which is vsed in a Prouerbe, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the dissimulation of those, which make faire apparence of amitie, &amp; within beare the venome of hate and emnitie.</p>
               <p>The two most famous gallants of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine court, haue been two youthes, the one exceeding the other, <hi>Hippolite</hi> of <hi>Medicis,</hi> and <hi>Alexander Farnese.</hi> And as for the first, we haue alreadie shewed his <hi>Impresa, Inter omnes</hi> of the Comet, and the eclipsed Moone.

               <p>The second was one which I made him, to

satisfie his request: which is to be seene in his rich and stately embrodered. Tapistrie: and it hapned vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this occasion: On a time talking with me he sayd, that at the beginning of his Cardinallhipp he was not resolued what <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presa</hi> to take, and that I should compose him one, to this effect, that he sayd vnto me: if God did fauour him in his secrete desires, in time would he publishe them with some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>Impresa.</hi> Whereupon I figured a little scrole of white paper, with this briefe aboue it, <hi>Votis subscribunt fata secundis.</hi>

               <p>Lastly, when by <hi>Pope Paulus</hi> the third, he was sent Legat into <hi>Germanie</hi> with the flower of the Italian Cheualrie, to aide the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the fift against the Dutch men, which fauoured the doctrine of <hi>Luther,</hi> and rebelled against him, I made for his <hi>Impresa,</hi> the triple forked lightning, the peculiar weapon of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> which he vseth when he will chasten the pride and impietie of men, as he did in the time of the <hi>Giants,</hi> with this mot, <hi>Hoc vno Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter vltor:</hi> alluding the excommunications to lightning and the Pope to <hi>Iupiter.</hi> By the ayd of this supplie, which at the beginning of the warres came very commodiously, <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour gayned the victorie.</p>

                  <hi>Mons, Andre Gritti,</hi> Purueyer for the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> warres, wherein he was renowmed from the beginning to the ende, which warres en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured eight yeres, and merited by his coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb facs="tcp:3275:59"/>
valour, to be Prince and Duke of their Commonwealth. At that time by his power was <hi>Padoua</hi> recouered and defended against the forces of <hi>Maximilian,</hi> who had on his side all the Nations of <hi>Europe:</hi> He had a notable <hi>Imprese,</hi> inuented by <hi>Giouan Catta,</hi> the famous Poet of <hi>Verona:</hi> &amp; it was the heauen with the <hi>Zodiac</hi> and the twelue Signes, borne vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the shoulders of <hi>Atlas,</hi> kneeling on his left knee, and with his handes embracing the heauens, with a mot there aboue, <hi>Sustinet nec fatiscit:</hi> Albeit the Lord (respecting modestie) would not weare it publiquely, to auoyde enuie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it greatly pleased him, and was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended of euery man. <hi>Atlas</hi> hath a humaine forme, yet is the thing tollerable by reason it is a fiction.</p>
               <p>The Lady <hi>Isabella Marquise</hi> of <hi>Mantona,</hi> doth not deserue to be passed ouer in silence, who for her honorable conditions was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes esteemed to be of a noble minde, and had sundry times of her life, diuers assaults of fortune, which gaue her occasion to haue more then one <hi>Impresa,</hi> and amongst other, it hapned that for the vnmeasured loue (which her sonne Duke <hi>Federico,</hi> which he bare to a Lady, to whome he did all the fauour and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he might. Whereby the Lady <hi>Isabella</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned vnhonoured and little esteemed. But the beloued of the Duke vsed to ride very stately thorowe the Citie, accompanied with
<pb facs="tcp:3275:60"/>
a great troupe of gallant gentlemen, which were wont to attend on the Marquise. And at length it came to this, that there remayned to accompany her, but only two or three old gentlemen which neuer would forsake her. Vpon which inconucnience, the sayde Lady caused to be figured this <hi>Impresa,</hi> in the olde Court of her Pallace in the Suburbs, to this purpose: which was a Candelsticke made triangulare wise, whereon are set many Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delsticks for diuine seruice vsed at this day in the holy weeke. From the which Candelstick not without some misterie the priestes vse to take away the Candles one by one, vntil they haue left on the top of all but one, to signifie that the light of fayth cannot perish at all. Vnto the which deuise there wanted a mot, whereupon I added this. <hi>Sufsicit vnum in tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebris,</hi> according to that of <hi>Virgil, Vnum pro multis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Sonne and Heire of the Marquise of <hi>Vasto,</hi> inheritour of the name, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of the great Marquise of <hi>Piscara,</hi> in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was seene the expresse Image of vertue, stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to attayne to the glorie of his Vncle, &amp; Father, and of his other Ancestors at such time as he went into Spayne to serue King Phillip, I figured a great tree of Lawrell per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning to the auncient house of the <hi>Auolos,</hi> from the which Lawrell were seene certayne great branches cut of, and among the rest
<pb facs="tcp:3275:60"/>
which remayned, was a straight and gallant twigge springing vp on a great height, with this mot: <hi>Triumphali è stipite surgens alta petit,</hi> which was so much the more congruent to the purpose, for that the Lawrell is dedicated to triumphers.</p>
               <p>I will not omit one which I made the last yere for <hi>Sinior Andrca,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante Gonzaga,</hi> who being a youth of great hope and towardnes, hauing gotten to bee Captayne of a band of horsemen, he required of me an <hi>Impresa</hi> for his Standarde: and I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding to that of <hi>Virgil, Parma inglorius alba,</hi> caused to bee depaynted a Shielde or rounde buckler, all fringed about, with foure rounde circles set at foure sides thereof, bound toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with foure wreathes of Lawrell.

That of the Earle <hi>Colo</hi> of <hi>Campo Basso,</hi> who liued in the memorie of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, had both a subiect and a soule. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in pay with the great Charles of <hi>Bourgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> feared not to aduenture the reproch of notable disloyaltie, to be reuenged of a perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culare iniury, and it was for some displeasure conceiued against the Duke (a man without measure chollericke) for crossing him in a consultation holden concerning the warres, for the which he bare him deadly hatred, and it so stack in his disdainful stomacke, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the time of reuenge, he could neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it, which fitly was offred him in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb facs="tcp:3275:61"/>
of <hi>Nansi,</hi> where he gaue aduertisement to <hi>Renato</hi> Duke of <hi>Loren,</hi> that he should not fearc to assault the Duke his Lorde with the <hi>Suissars,,</hi> for that he with his companie would not once moue to giue ayde, but be as loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers on. Whereby in that conflict the Duke was slayne, and the Earle <hi>Cola</hi> addressed him toward Fraunce, to acquaint him with King Lewes. And his <hi>Impresa</hi> was afterward a great mightie stone of Marble, cleft with the force of a Figge tree springing out of the creuise thereof, which in time creeping and encro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching farther into the Marble, spoyleth and defaceth it with weake force and slender vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and aboue it was this mot taken out of <hi>Martial, Ingentia Marmora findit caprificus.</hi> And this <hi>Impresa</hi> was not onely counted gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant in shewe, but also an example for Princes that they ought not in choler to abuse their seruants, especially such as be noble and of stoute courage.</p>

               <p>This reuenge was great, but very ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious, and not vnlike to that of the Priest <hi>Rinaldo da Modena,</hi> sometimes Steward, and Chamberlaiue to the Cardinall of Yorke in England, who hauing receiued besides the iniury of words, certayne blowes of the sayde Cardinall, which he could not well digest, and to be reuenged thereof he gaue him poyson, whereof he died, and afterward confessing his fact, his body was quartered in Rome, in

Wherefore remaining alw aies, expecting some recompence in his loue, bare for his deuise a pot full of little blacke stones, with one amongst all the rest white, with this mot, <hi>AEquabit nigras candida vna dies:</hi> meaning, the day wherein he should bee thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie the loue of his Mistrisse, should counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile all the blacke, clowdie, and vnfortunate daies of his life.

                  <hi>Signior Dominico,</hi> this deuise although it sauor of subtile inuention, yet doe I mislike it for two reasons: the one is, for that (as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) it hath bin deuised alreadie by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Alciat</hi> in his <hi>Emblems:</hi> the other for that it is not agreable to you, in so much you were not planted venemous, for then could you not haue brought forth such fruite in your natiue soyle as you haue done.

               <p>Truely I confesse my Lord, you haue done more then your age would well allowe, yet this I say, that he which shall peruse and see what you haue written of this matter, will say you haue reserued many other notable deuises. But herein you may excuse your self, and say as you did in your Booke <hi>de Elogijs,</hi> or the discourse of famous me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, newly published: that albeit there are certaine left out, yet the fault was not yours, in that you had not their true portraitures, but rather theirs who neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to send them to your studie, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie so many worthie and Heroical persons.
<pb facs="tcp:3275:66"/>
As of late I met with a certaine Gentleman of the Prouince of <hi>Romagna,</hi> greatly complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that he could not finde in your <hi>Elogies,</hi> the Knight <hi>della Volpe,</hi> who shewed himself so valiaunt a man in the seruice of S. <hi>Marke,</hi> and for the honor of Italie. But I to comfort him said, that I was assured the said Knight would not willingly haue his Picture drawne, being somewhat deformed in visage, hauing lost an eye honorably in fight, and that I would for recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce procure him a place in this tract of <hi>Imprese:</hi> and thereupon I demaunded him whether he had euer borne any. What Sir (saith he) is it not wel knowne he bare a Foxe in his Ensigne shewing his deuouring teeth, with this mot, <hi>Simul astu &amp; dentibus vtor:</hi> to signifie that there was no dealing with him being so defended on euery side.</p>

               <p>In deede the Knight was of great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and vigilancie, and eskapeth not our hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie without great commendation: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the <hi>Venetians</hi> erected him a goodly sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in their Church of our Ladie.</p>
               <p>And now at the last I will not conceale the <hi>Impresa</hi> of <hi>Giouanni Chiuchiera,</hi> accompted a famous Knight in Warre, although it maie (like vnto the former) moue the beholders to laugh, which had depainted in his Banner, (to shew his courage and skill in the exercise of light Horse) a fierce Wolfe with a bloodie Lambe betweene his legges, turning his head

backe regarding two great Sheepheards Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiues, whereof the one being nerest, looking also backe behinde him to see if the other dogges came in to succour him, as fearing to assaile so terrible an enemie: the mot added thereunto was, <hi>Pauent oues, Timent canes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepidus maneo.</hi> But <hi>Signior Dominico,</hi> the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Captaines with their <hi>Imprese</hi> being so great, that it will confound the wittes of the diligent and laborous writer, I thinke it best for this time, to giue an end to our discourse.</p>

            <p>ACertaine gentleman of Italie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Hermet Stampo,</hi> a Prelate, bare for his deuise a <hi>Lawrell</hi> tree menaced with lightning, with this briefe: <hi>Nec sorte, necfato,</hi> to signifie that his vertue could not be endama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged or anoyed by any fatale chaunce, for lightning (as writeth <hi>Plinie</hi>) hath no powre to hurt the <hi>Lawrell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same <hi>S.

            </p>
            <p>His brother the Earle <hi>Maximian,</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous of a Lady named <hi>Anna Moronna,</hi> who afterward was his wife, had for his <hi>Impresa</hi> a silk worme, which only liueth with the leaues
<pb facs="tcp:3275:67"/>
of the <hi>Mulberie</hi> tree, which tree in <hi>Lombardie</hi> is called <hi>Moronna,</hi> with this mot: <hi>Suol di cio viuo,</hi> which is halfe this verse of <hi>Petrarch: Suol di cio viuo e d' altra mi calpoco.</hi> Thus in English: Onely of this I liue disdayning other foode, to shewe that as the little beast doth only liue by those leaues: so he onely contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to feede on the leaues of his loue, in hope one day to enioy the fruit of legitimate mariage.</p>
            <p>The Earle <hi>Baptista di Lodron,</hi> who died at the taking of <hi>Gazal Montferrato,</hi> had for his perticular deuise a Calthrope, a Stratagemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal instrument vsed in warre, made with three yron prickes so ioyned, that howsoeuer it be throwen, one prick alwayes standeth vpright, with this Posie thereunto: <hi>In vtra<expan>

            <p>
               <hi>Gasper de Mayno,</hi> a Knight of <hi>Millan,</hi> bare a Stockdoue with a Diamant in her bill, being the nature of this birde neuer to lose any thing it hath once taken, thereby to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that he would neuer giue ouer to loue his Lady, whose vowed seruant he faithfully remayned, whose name was also <hi>Diamante.</hi> His mot was: <hi>In aeternum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Lisard</hi> of all his properties, hath one most rare and admirable, among the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and infinite effects of nature, which is, it

is neuer in loue to the which all other beasts doe yeeld, whereupon <hi>S. Federico</hi> Duke of <hi>Mantona,</hi> made him this <hi>Impresa:</hi> The <hi>Lisard</hi> figured, with this mot: <hi>Quod huic deest me Iorquet.</hi> Meaning thereby that it was the loue of his Lady which tormented him, from the which torments this beast was exempt.</p>
            <p>The Earle <hi>Maurucio Pietra,</hi> who afterward was Bishop of <hi>Uigena,</hi> being Student in <hi>Suna,</hi> tooke to his surname <hi>Disarmato,</hi> for that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a souldier, he left the practise of Armes, and tooke him selfe to his studies, whereby he amounted at length to the Pontificall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitie. He had for his deuise a Snayle, with her head foorth of her shel wounded with an arrowe, &amp; his mot was this verse of <hi>Petrarch: Trouonemi amor del tutto disarmato.</hi> Thus in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish. Loue did me finde vnarmed, quite allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his surname, and also to the <hi>Impresa</hi> of that vniuersitie, which was a Snayle put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire, which feeling the heate thereof doth scritche, wherevpon the Louewormes, slaues to affections, would inferre that they being all fiered with amourous flames, were constrayned to sing and discharge in langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing verse their sweete sowre passions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sinior Charlo Ursino,</hi> had for his <hi>Impresa</hi> a Ball mounted vp on hye with the stroke of an hardie arme with this mot <hi>Perculsus eleuor,</hi> which might be alluded to his inuincible courage, who the more his power was abated
<pb facs="tcp:3275:68"/>
by aduerse fortune, the more he seemed to exalt his vnconquered mind by force of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
            <p>A yong gallant of <hi>Salerna,</hi> hauing a long time serued a curteous and beautifull dame, and at length by the fauour of the winged boy cropped both the flower and fruite of his long deferred pleasures, to the extreme contention of ech of them both. But fortune fell to good hap, set her enuious foote in the pleasant plotte of their delights, to fade the sweete sauoring Flowres of their vnconstant ioyes. For this youth roming about the citie, vnhappely hapned to fixe both his rouing eyes and flitting fancie on the force of a yong Damosell adorned with infinite beautie, and was so ardently inamored, that he doted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her. In which new affection, the heauens seemed so fauourable to further his purpose, that he easely trayned the tender heart of his yeelding Lady to the lure of his loue, as one greatly delighted to liue by exchaunging: whereupon (as louers are commonly wont to beare open eares and vnclosed eyes, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to repeate a falfe tale for trueth) his first fauoured to whome bruted fame had reuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the transported affection of the wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring youth, seeing her selfe abandoned, liued desolate, plunged in the deapth of all perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xities, and almost desperate. Yet at the length waighing her case with wisdome, did mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb facs="tcp:3275:69"/>
the griefe of her desaster, without disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering to any her secret sorowe, purposing onely to disclose, by some couert meane, to the disloyall and vngratefull louer, her pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue and passionate heart. And thereupon she caused a false Diamant, to be so cunningly set in Gold, that it would easely haue deceiued any man saue onely the expert artificer, and within the ring next vnto the finger, she had made to be engrauen this mot in <hi>Ebrewe: Lamazabatani,</hi> which done, all dissolued into teares she sent it to her loue, praying him, if any pittie or pietie remayned in the breast of a periured, to haue compassion on her, and restore her his loue. The youth being learned and discreete, that at the first sight he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode the Hebrewe mot, yet could he not comprehend what secret the deuise (impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) vntill by chaunce shewing his ring to a frend of his, an excellent gold smith, who told him that the Stone was a counterfait, he began to meditate on the mistery, and loue hauing opened the eyes of his vnderstanding, he soone perceiued thereby the lamentable complaint of the miserable Lady, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury he had done her: resoluing into two words the mot of the false Diamant, in this sort: <hi>Di amante falso.</hi> Adding thereunto her <note place="margin">Of a false Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</note> mot out of the Gospell, signifying why hast thou forsaken me. Whereupon the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man sorowing his fact, had compassion on
<pb facs="tcp:3275:69"/>
the desolate dame, placing her againe in the possession of his loue, which she long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enioyed.</p>
            <p>The Earle <hi>Clemete Pietro</hi> being amorous of a Ladie, enforced for a time to depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, had for his <hi>Impresa</hi> an Elephant, which by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (as saith <hi>Plinie</hi>) knowing that the Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ters pursue it for no other thing but for his teeth, (which are of admirable vertue) he knocketh them out against a tree: His mot was out of <hi>Petrarch. Lascai di me la meglior parte a dietro.</hi> I left behind the better parte of me.</p>
            <p>The same Gentleman being also at an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time inamoured of a Gentlewoman na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Laura,</hi> he had for his deuise a Rauen co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batting with a Cameleon, who being hurte and inuenomed by his enemie, knowing the wound to bee deadlie, to cure himself taketh the fruite of the Laurel in his mouth: his mot was, <hi>Hinc sola salus:</hi> to signifie that his amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wound neede no better <hi>Cataplasme,</hi> then his Ladie <hi>Laura.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had also another, being Captaine of the Horsmen in <hi>Piemont,</hi> which was an Egle fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so high against the Sunne that it burned her feathers, with this mot, <hi>Aude aliquid dignum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth deuise of this worthie Knight, was a naked sworde hauing this mot, <hi>Ex hoc in hoc:</hi> to shewe how he was to trie by the sworde his iust cause, and the reason he had
<pb facs="tcp:3275:70"/>
t<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>o combat with his enemie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Giouanni Battista Bottigella,</hi> an honorable Gentleman desirous to expresse an amorous conceipt, had for his <hi>Impresa</hi> a Ship with hoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed sayle, and the Fishe called in Latin <hi>Remora</hi> holding it fast: which Fishe (as <hi>Plinie</hi> recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) is of such great force, that if it take to a Ship, it staieth it and holdeth the same so fast, that neither the furie of windes, nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther force, is of power to stirre it: His mot was, <hi>Sic frustra:</hi> signifying that euen so it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing preuailed him to bee faithfull and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant to his Ladie, sith she shewed her selfe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and cruell towards him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hippolito Girami</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Millan,</hi> at the warres of <hi>Sienae,</hi> in the seruice of the Emperour, bare a sworde figured, with a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent twinding about it, hauing a Laurell gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in his mouth, with this posie, <hi>His duoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</hi> The sword in this place signifying stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth and valure of bodie: The Scrpent wisedome and vertue of minde.</p>
            <p>A certaine Gentleman to signifie that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his courteouse and gentle nature, was willing to please in euery vertuouse and reasonable action, but by force, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>straint he was not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to do any thing: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon he figured a Palme tree, whose proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is sufficiently knowne, with this mot, <hi>Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctimur obsequio non viribus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An Italian Ladie named <hi>Liuia Tormiella,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3275:70"/>
was in her life most beautifull, &amp; of rare cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie, who to signifie the integritie of her worthie mind wholie addicted to vertue, had depainted <hi>Heliotropium</hi> the Marigold, which alwaies turneth towardes the Sunne, as if it had sence, with this mot, <hi>Uertitur ad solem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An honorable Gentleman hauing vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunatlie maried a wife of singulare beautie, but (according to the common rumour) of single honestie. For all wnich knewe him, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely beleeued that she offred him an extreme iniurie, as in trueth she did. But the poore Gentleman (as commonly it hapneth in the like case) perceiuing her vnfaithfull dealing, dronke vp his sorrowe in silence, intreating (notwithstanding) his wife honorablie, in all louely maner: supposing thereby, for that she spra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of noble blood, that she would become faithfull and loyall, respecting her honor. But herein he was greatly deceiued: for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyall Dame hauing sauoured the sweete of sondrie dishes, neglected her olde diet as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant to her insatiable appetite, which he to his insupportable griefe vnderstanding, to excuse his hard hap, figured <hi>Argus</hi> with his hundred eyes garding <hi>Io</hi> the Minion of <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> transformed into a Cowe, who, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his diligent watching was deceiued of his chardge: Hereunto he added this mot, <hi>Frustra vigilant.</hi>

               <hi>Girolamo Palauicino,</hi> did beare for his <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presa</hi>

            </p>
            <p>A certaine Gentleman hauing espoused a noble and vertuouse wife, caused her to were for her <hi>Impresa</hi> a Snayle closed in her shell, as she remaineth all the winter, to defende her from the colde, with this Posie, <hi>Proprio alitur succo:</hi> to signifie that she should satisfie her self with the loue of her owne husband, euen as the Snayle is nourished with her owne moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture.</p>
            <p>A Dutch Gentleman soiourning at <hi>Neples</hi> the nurce of delicious pleasures, and recourse of all vices, in the blouming flower of his youthfull yeares, being well monied, became amorous of a Dame, with who he spent both his vnrecouerable time, and consumed his dearlie gotten treasure, in vaine delights, and vnconstaunt pleasures. But at length co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing his error, knowing whether his youth and this abuse would bring him, accepting good councell retired from <hi>Naples,</hi> to escape the toyles of inticing affections. And to shew his intention he figured a Bucke, couched in
<pb facs="tcp:3275:71"/>
a ditch: being the nature of this beast, that after hauing conioyned with the female, doth so lothe himselfe by reason of the stenche of his filthinesse, that he retireth solitarilie into some ditch, wherein he remaineth vntil there happen a great shoure of rayne to washe and make him cleane: and afterward returneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to feede: his Posie was, <hi>Lasciuiae paeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia.</hi>

            <p>A certaine gentleman after his long and tedious suite, finding the soyle which he til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led altogether fruitles, and the flintie heart of his mistresse to afforde him no fauour, to shewe that his maladie was without remedy, he figured an heart wounded with an arrow, with a branch of the herbe <hi>Dictamus</hi> in his mouth, which herbe groweth plentifully in <hi>Candia,</hi> whereof the wounded Hart eating is said to be cured, with this Spanish mot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto. <hi>Esto tiene su remepio y non yo,</hi> As much to say, this beast findeth remedie, and not I: like vnto that, whereas <hi>Phaebus</hi> in <hi>Ouid,</hi> complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of his loue to <hi>Daphne,</hi> saying:
