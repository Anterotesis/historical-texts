         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Eaſtland-Merchants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againſt the giving of a General LIBERTY

            <head>REASONS humbly offered by the Governour, Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,
and Fellowſhip of <hi>Eaſtland</hi> Merchants, againſt
the giving of a general Liberty to all Perſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
to export the Engliſh Woollen-Manufacture whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they pleaſe.</head>
            <p>IT was the obſervation of a great Man in his time,
that the ill Succeſs which did attend Princes and States
in their great Affairs, did generally ariſe through the
miſtake of that which was their true Intereſt; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
of all Errors in Judgment, that which relates
to a Man's Intereſt, where it has been miſtaken, has
been ever obſerved to be of a moſt fatal Conſequence; for
as it is natural for every thing to tend to its proper Centre,
ſo it is as natural for every Man to perſue (tho' by different
ways and means) that which he apprehends to be his proper
Intereſt; wherein if he happen to be miſtaken, what can
follow? But inſtead of applying himſelf to that which is his
real advantage, he manytimes perſueth with his utmoſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
that which in the iſſue proveth the direct contrary.</p>
            <p>That they are under a miſ-apprehenſion of this nature, who
do aſſert that a general Liberty to all Perſons to export our
<hi>Woollen-Manufacture</hi> where they pleaſe, will conduce much
to the intereſt of the Nation, under a ſuppoſition that it will
encreaſe the vent thereof; we humbly apprehend will be
clearly evident upon the following conſiderations; which (as
in duty bound) we ſubmit to the Judgment of our Superiours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> We affirm, That a General Permiſſion of Exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(as before mentioned) will be a means to debaſe the
Reputation of our <hi>Engliſh-Manufacture,</hi> and conſequently
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103082:3"/>
render it leſs deſireable and ſought after abroad.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> It will overthrow all the Incorporated Companies of
<hi>Merchants</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> as the <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> the <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> (though
eſtabliſhed by Act of Parliament) the <hi>Eaſt-Land,</hi> the <hi>Turkey,</hi>
the <hi>Eaſt-India,</hi> and the <hi>Affrican;</hi> the Miſchiefs conſequential
upon which, will be as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Trade of <hi>England</hi> will thereby be loſt as to the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> and come to be all, or at leaſt wiſe the greateſt
part, in the hands of Forreigners; as it formerly was,
before the ſaid Companies were erected.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> All the Priviledges obtained by the ſaid Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
from the Princes, States, and Governours of
the places of their reſpective Reſidences (which are
of great advantage to the vending of our <hi>Engliſh-Manufacture)</hi>
will be utterly loſt.</item>
               <item>3. The Navigation of <hi>England</hi> by degrees will be very
much impaired, and diſcouraged.</item>
            </list>
            <p>3. Laſtly, to name no more, a general Permiſſion will be
ſo far from anſwering the End propoſed by it, of vend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a greater quantity of our <hi>Woollen-Manufacture</hi> than
was before; that in all probability, it will in the end prove
the contrary, and be the occaſion of vending a great deal leſs.</p>
            <p>The proving of which ſeveral Particulars we
ſhall undertake in Order, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. For the firſt, that a general Permiſſion will be, a means
to debaſe the reputation of our <hi>Manufactures</hi> abroad, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them leſs deſireable; will appear as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The trade of the <hi>Manufacture</hi> being now chiefly in
the management of Regulated Companies, it is both
their Care and their Intereſt that the ſaid <hi>Manufacture</hi>
be not debaſed in its worth, whereby it may come to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103082:3"/>
a diſ-eſteem abroad; which general Traders will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be mindful of.</p>
            <p>The appointing ſet times of Shipping will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
which (tho' now diſ-uſed) yet hath ſometimes
been found neceſſary by regulated Companies, in order
to bring the <hi>Manufacture</hi> into an eſteem again, when by
an Exportation of much more than the Market could
take off, it became unvendible, and a Drugg.</p>
            <p>A General Permiſſion letteth in all ſorts of ignorant
Traders, who for want of Judgment in the ſaid <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture,</hi>
know not how to make choice of ſuch which
are proper for the Market, and when they have them
there, are forced many times by their neceſſities to ſell
them to loſs, whereby our <hi>Manufacture</hi> cometh to be
undervalued, and our Nation greatly prejudiced, an
inſtance of which, we find recorded as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had for
a good while together, a profitable Trade, and good
Sales for their Engliſh <hi>Manufactures</hi> at <hi>Narve,</hi> in the
<hi>Baltick Sea,</hi> until at length, in the year 1565<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of ſtragling Merchants and unskillful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Traders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted
thither out of this Realm with their Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
by which means, in a little while, the Trade
which before was good, was utterly ſpoiled, inſomuch,
that many of them went about the Town with Cloth
upon their Arms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a Meaſure in their Hands, and
ſold the ſame by the Arſine (a Meaſure of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try)
to the great embaſing of that excellent Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
the diſcredit of our Nation, and the final impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhment,
and utter undoing of the ſaid ſtragling
Merchants; all which being made known to her
Majeſty, and her Privy-Council, Order was taken at
the next Parliament, that the Town of <hi>Narve</hi> (then
under the jurisdiction of the <hi>Muſcovite)</hi> ſhould be
comprized within the Charter of the <hi>Ruſſia</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103082:4"/>
to prevent the like evil kind of dealing for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and making vile the principal Commodity of the
Nation. And it was ſo done accordingly by Act of
Parliament, which one inſtance amongſt others, is
ſufficient to evidence, that a general permiſſion of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
to all Perſons, will be an occaſion of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our <hi>Manufacture</hi> into a diſ-eſteem; which was our
firſt Reaſon.</p>
            <p>2. A General Permiſſion will overthrow all the incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Companies of Merchants of <hi>England;</hi> the evil Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of which will be</p>
            <p>1. That the trade of <hi>England</hi> will
thereby in time be loſt as to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
and come by degrees into the hands of
Forreigners.</p>
            <p>The Trade of this Nation was formerly (as it were
intirely) in the Forreigners Hands. <hi>viz.</hi> The Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the <hi>Haus-Towns,</hi> who were incorporated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Society, by the name of the Merchants of the
<hi>Dutch-Hans,</hi> and had many Priviledges and Immunities
granted them by the Kings and Princes of this Realm,
and amongſt others a <hi>Guildhall,</hi> afterwards called the
<hi>Steel-yard,</hi> for the better carrying on their ſaid Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as appeareth by a Charter granted to them in
the twenty third year of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third; but
more eſpecially by another Charter granted to them
in the forty fourth year of the ſaid King <hi>Henry</hi> the
third, and that General Charter to forreign Merchants,
granted by King <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, in the 31<hi>st</hi> Year
of His Reign.</p>
            <p>About the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
began to Trade themſelves into the Eaſt-parts, at
which the Eaſterlings or Merchants of the <hi>Dutch-Hans,</hi>
were ſo offended, that they took ſeveral of their Ships
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103082:4"/>
and Goods, and offered them ſeveral other Injuries,
which occaſioned great Complaints and Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the ſaid King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi> and <hi>Couradus de
Junigen,</hi> then Maſter General of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Order in
<hi>Pruſſia,</hi> with the <hi>Hans</hi> Townes: And divers <hi>Embaſſies</hi>
paſſed betwixt them, on that Account, the Reſult of
which in ſhort was this, that the ſaid King <hi>Henry</hi> the
4<hi>th.</hi> finding by the ſaid Priviledges granted to Forreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
his own Subjects (to the great Prejudice of the
Realm) very much crippled in their Trade; did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
ſuch parts of the Priviledges of the aforeſaid <hi>Dutch</hi>
Company, as were inconſiſtent with the carryeing on
of a Trade by the Natives of this Realm, and for the
better Encouragement of his owne Subjects, did in the
<hi>5th.</hi> Year of His Reign, grant his firſt Charter to
the Merchants Trading into the <hi>Eaſtland,</hi> containing
many great Priviledges, and Immunities, as by the ſaid
Charter may appear; which having a good effect to
the bringing of the Trade much more into the hands of
the Natives of this Realm than was before, King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the <hi>4th.</hi> for their more Ample Encouragement,
did in the Second Year of His Reign, grant another
Large Charter, to the Merchants of <hi>England;</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to thoſe Reſiding in the <hi>Nether-Lands,</hi> with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
additional Immunities and Priviledges, as by the
Charter at Large may appear.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>1st.</hi> and <hi>2d.</hi> of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Charter to the <hi>Ruſſia</hi> Company, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
confirmed by Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> in the <hi>8th.</hi>
Year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Until whoſe time, tho' the Trade of this Nation
was driven much more by the Natives thereof, than
had been formerly, yet had the Society of the <hi>Dutch-Hans,</hi>
at the <hi>Steele-Yard,</hi> much the advantage of them,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103082:5"/>
by means of their well regulated Societies, and the
priviledges they enjoyed, inſomuch that almoſt the
whole Trade was driven by them, to that degree, that
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Her Self when She came to have a
War, was forced to buy the <hi>Hemp, Pitch, Tarr, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
and other <hi>Naval</hi> Proviſions, which She wanted of
Forreigners, and that too, at their own Rates; nor
was there any Stores of either in the Land to ſupply
her occaſions on a ſuddain, but what at great Rates She
prevailed with them to fetch for Her, even in time of
War; they being ſtrangers not regarding the Intereſt
of the Nation, and Her own Subjects, being as then
but very little Traders: To remedy which, She fell
upon the conſideration, how She might at home have
a well-grounded dependance, to have thoſe neceſſary
Commodities by Her, that ſo She might not want
them, when She moſt needed them; and after great
deliberation, no better Expedient could be found, by
the ſaid Queen, and Her Council, than by encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her own Subjects to be the <hi>Merchants,</hi> which She
did, by erecting out of them ſeveral Societies; of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,</hi>
as that of the <hi>Eaſt-Land Company,</hi> and other
<hi>Companies,</hi> by which means, and by cancelling many
of the Priviledges of the forementioned <hi>Dutch-Hans</hi>
Society, the Trade in General, by degrees came to be
managed by the Natives of this Realm, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Profit of all thoſe Trades accrewed to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Nation; Trade in general, and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Shipping was
encreaſed, Her own Cuſtomes vaſtly augmented, and
what was at firſt the great End of all obtained, <hi>viz.</hi>
That She had conſtantly, lying at home, in the hands
of Her own Subjects, all ſorts of Naval Proviſions and
Stores, which She could make uſe of, as Her occaſions
required them, without any dependance on Her Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
for the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:103082:5"/>
And thus by the means of the Erecting the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Societies, and Preſerving and Encouraging
that of the <hi>Merchant-Adventurers,</hi> was the Trade at
firſt gained from Forreigners to the Natives of this
Realme, to its Ineſtimable Advantage; and by
the ſame means hath been hitherto in great meaſure
preſerved; but if theſe Societies ſhould be overthrown,
as they will certainly be, by a general Liberty granted
to all Perſons, both Strangers and others, to carry our
<hi>Woollen-Manufactures</hi> to the places of their reſpective
Priviledges, the Trade will again by degrees be loſt to
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and fall into the hands of Forreigners;
ſince it is clearly evident, that the Trade of <hi>England,</hi>
to the Natives of this Realm, can by no other ways
be preſerved, than by the ſame method it was at firſt
obtained, <hi>viz.</hi> the Supporting the ſeveral and reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Societies of <hi>Merchants,</hi> in their Priviledges and
Immunities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> The next Miſcheif that will follow upon the
overthrow of the reſpective Companies, conſequential
upon a General Permiſſion, is this; that all the benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Priviledges obtained at the hands of the Princes and
Governours of the reſpective Places of their Reſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
will be utterly Loſt, to the very great diſadvantage
of the Vending of our Engliſh <hi>Manufacture,</hi> and this is
ſo apparent, that it needeth no enlargement; for if
the Companies fall, their Priviledges muſt neceſſarily
fall with them, and tho' obtained at the Interceſſion of
our Princes, and at the great expence and ſollicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the ſaid Companies, yet if a General permiſſion
be granted to all perſons to Trade to the places of their
Priviledges, they will be forthwith looked upon, but
under the notion of general Traders, and their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
which in ſome Places are greater than thoſe
Princes own Subjects enjoy, will be by them gladly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103082:6"/>
celled, and re-aſſumed, which is ſo apparent to every
Mans reaſon, that we ſhall add no more about it.</p>
            <p>3. The laſt miſchief mentioned ariſing by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
tbrow of the Companies, of which a General Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to trade to the places of the Priviledges is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
conſequence, is this, That the Navigation of
<hi>England</hi> will by degrees be thereby much impaired, and
this is almoſt as apparent as the former; for it is a certain
Maxim, that the encreaſe of Navigation followeth
the encreaſe of Trade; and if the Trade of <hi>England</hi>
fall into the Hands of Forreigners, as it will in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time do,) by the diſcouragement of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
the Navigation of <hi>England</hi> muſt likewiſe in
time decay; for it has been always obſerved that the
Forreigner will not make uſe of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Shipping if
he can have any other, for beſides his National, his
Perſonal Intereſt leadeth him to the contrary, in as
much as he can have his Goods carried at cheaper Rates
in forreign Shipping, who can, and do Sail at much
eaſier Charge than our <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ſo our Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
by degrees will be much impaired.</p>
            <p>3. We come now to the third and laſt reaſon that a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Permiſſion will be ſo far from gaining the end propoſed
by it, that in all Probability it will in the event prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
which if we make out, (as we hope we ſhall) by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and that backed by the experience of former and latter
times: It will then (we preſume) be ſatisfactory to all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted
Perſons, that a General Permiſſion will be no ways
for the good, but much to the prejudice of this Nation.</p>
            <p>In order to the proof of which we ſhall lay down this
as a ſure Maxim, <hi>that it is not the quantity of Woollen-Manufacture
exported, but what the Markets abroad are
able to take off, and thoſe Nations expend; which is the true
Rule, by which our meaſures muſt be taken, as to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of our</hi> Engliſh Manufacture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:103082:6"/>
For inſtance, If in one year there ſhould be twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Cloths ſent unto a Place whoſe Markets and
expence will take off but ten Thouſand; Will the
Expence of our <hi>Manufacture</hi> be ever the larger for that
great Exportation? No, for the other ten Thouſand
muſt lye undiſpoſed of, for the expence of the next
year, ſo that by how much the more <hi>Manufacture</hi> was
ſent the firſt Year, there will be ſo much the leſs
ſent the next, and ſo from year to year, accordingly
as the expence requires it; unleſs it can be ſuppoſed
that the Merchant will ſtill be ſending out, without
conſideration had of his ſelling abroad, which, as it is
irrational to ſuppoſe, ſo it is impoſſible to be, done
without an unexhauſtable ſtock. By which it appeareth,
and is clearly evident, That a general Permiſſion may
well change the hands of the Exporters, but can never
encreaſe the expence of the <hi>Manufacture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can the Companies of Merchants, as
ſuch, leſſen; or the general Permiſſion,
encreſe, athe ſaid Exportation, but in one of
theſe three caſes, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Either firſt, if the ſaid Companies ſhould make any
By-Laws amongſt themſelves, to limit the Exportation of
the ſaid <hi>Manufactures,</hi> in order to advancing of it in Price.
This we muſt confeſs, would be a hindrance to its Expence;
but we can, and do aver, that there is not, nor ever was,
that we know of in ours or any of the ſaid Companies, any
By-Laws to limit or reſtrain the Exportation.</p>
            <p>Or <hi>2dly.</hi> If the Members of the ſaid Companies, as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<hi>Merchants</hi> ſhould make a combination among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that they would not Tranſport above ſuch a number of
Clothes in ſuch a time, or ſell them under ſuch a rate, that ſo
their Price might be advanced: But this conſidering the great
numbers of Perſons in the ſeveral Companies, &amp; their different
<pb facs="tcp:103082:7"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:103082:8"/>
particular Intereſt, (all which muſt be compriſed in ſuch a
Combination) is Morally Impoſſible; and is that which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was, nor can be done.</p>
            <p>3. Or Laſtly, if the <hi>Merchants</hi> of the reſpective Companies,
have not ſufficient ſtock to take off asmuch of our <hi>Manufacture,</hi>
and ſend it to the reſpective places of their Reſidence, as thoſe
Markets are capable of Vending; but that this is not ſo, we may
with modeſty affirm ſince it is well known, that the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants</hi>
of the reſpective Companies, have Stocks ſufficient to
carry off five times as much of our <hi>Manufacture,</hi> as the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Countries to which they Trade, can, or will vend.</p>
            <p>So that the <hi>Engliſh Merchants,</hi> being neither diſ-enabled
through want of Stock, nor hindred by any By-Law, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged
in any combination among themſelves, to ſend
leſs of our <hi>Manufacture</hi> to the places of their reſpective Trades,
than the Markets in thoſe places will take off, and vend;
it may reaſonably be concluded, that the <hi>Merchant</hi> would
be glad to ſend double the quantity they now do, if they
could find a vent for it, it being ſo much their Intereſt as to
Profit, to increaſe their Trade: <hi>And that a General Permiſſion,
(as was before intimated) may change the hands of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters,
but cannon in any wiſe increaſe the exportation it ſelf;</hi>
but inſtead thereof by the means of over glutting the Markets,
they are many times put upon a neceſſity of ſelling to loſs, by
which inconvenience, together with many other, if we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the experience, both of former Ages, and latter times; a
General Permiſſion hath brought our Manufacture into ſuch
diſ-eſteem, as hath much leſſened the exportation of it, to what
it was before.</p>
            <p>Two inſtances whereof, one of former Ages, and
the other of latter times, we ſhall crave leave to offer,
which we preſume will ſufficiently clear up the truth
of what has been alleadged.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>29th.</hi> Year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the <hi>Wool-Sellers
Clothiers,</hi> and others living upon the <hi>Woollen-manufacture</hi> finding
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103082:8"/>
themſelves grieved for want of ſufficient vent for the ſame
made their Complaint to the Queens Majeſty, and her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
and did aſſign the ſame Cauſe as is now pretended, <hi>viz</hi>
The Monopoly of the ſeveral Companies, and by that a wan
of Permiſſion for all Perſons, both Natives and Forreigners
to buy it up, and ſend it abroad; upon which it was then ſup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſed
that the only Remedy to cure this evil, would be to
give Liberty to all Perſons, both her Highneſs's Subjects, and
Forreigners to buy, and tranſport Cloth, and other <hi>Woollen-Manufactures</hi>
when, and where they pleaſed; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a general Permiſſion was granted, and they were enabled
thereunto by Letters Pattents from her Higneſs, directed to
the then Lord-Treaſurer, with a <hi>non obſtante</hi> to the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
Charter, and that the Charter of the City of <hi>London</hi>
might be no hindrance thereunto, (by reaſon that unfreemen
are thereby reſtrained from buying and ſelling at <hi>Blackwell-Hall</hi>
within the ſaid City, which was the ordinary Market-place
for buying and ſelling of Cloth) the ſign of the <hi>George</hi> in
<hi>Kingſtreet</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> was appointed in the ſaid Letters
Pattents, as a Market-place for all Clothiers, Merchants, and
others, both free and unfree, to reſort unto, as would take the
benefit of the ſaid General Permiſſion.</p>
            <p>But did the vent of the <hi>Manufacture</hi> encreaſe thereby? No,
but rather grew worſe and worſe. The Company being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to go on in their Trade under ſuch an Innovation, and the
Forreigner not taking it off, the <hi>Manufacture</hi> lay on the makers
Hands to that degree, that the poor People in <hi>Wiliſhire,</hi> and
<hi>Glouceſterſhire</hi> in great numbers were ready to grow into a
Mutiny; and when all Men expected nothing leſs than the
aboliſhing of the Company, as the only cauſe of all this
Grief; and the ſetting up the Merchants of the <hi>Steel-yard</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and eſtabliſhing that general Permiſſion, as the proper
Remedy: Nothing of this followed, but the Lords of the
Council ſent for the Company, and after they had been
heard, and had made known to them the true cauſe of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103082:9"/>
preſent want of Vent; they were ſo ſatisfied in them, as
to Will the ſaid Company to proceed as formerly in their
Trade, and gave them Promiſes of all the aſſiſtance, and
countenance for the future which they could reaſonably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire;
which, certainly their Lordſhips would not have done,
if that they had ſeen that the late Innovation, or general
Permiſſion had brought forth, or was likely to bring forth
the promiſed Effect, or that without Trading under regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Societies, ſo great a quantity of <hi>Woollen-Manufacture</hi>
could be vented, as was when they were maintained, and
defended in the Enjoyment of their Rights and Priviledges.</p>
            <p>The other Inſtance is of a much later Date, and freſh in
Memory; when, in the Year 1662, upon a complaint of the
like nature, a temporary Liberty was granted to all Perſons
to buy, and Ship out our <hi>Woollen-Manufacture;</hi> but ſo far
was it, upon Tryal made, from anſwering the End propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
that the very Clothiers themſelves did in the following
Year 1663, Petition that the ſaid liberty might be revoked,
and accordingly upon their Petition it was revoked, by his
late Majeſty, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second.</p>
            <p>And if it be now objected to us, that after all our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to prove that a general Permiſſion will not Increaſe the
vent of our <hi>Manufacture,</hi> we have in the mean time no where
affirmed what will, we muſt declare, that at preſent we know
but one of theſe two, either to put a ſtop to its making
in other Parts; or of making it ſo cheap here, that we may
be able to underſel our Neighbours.</p>
            <p>The firſt of which we know to be impoſſible, the latter,
we have reaſon to believe might give offence to thoſe who
are the Sellers of its Materials, tho' it is ſufficiently evident
to any common Underſtanding, that the cheapneſs of the
Materials is the moſt proper means of encreaſing the vent of
our <hi>Manufacture;</hi> for he that goeth cheapeſt to Market with
a Commodity of equal Goodneſs, ſhall thereby be enabled
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103082:9"/>
to ſell cheaper, and by that means be aſſured of the firſt
Market.</p>
            <p>And now, tho' there be many other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and further Inſtances which might
ſet ſorth the great National Miſchiefs, and
little benefit which will naturally ariſe from
ſuch a general Permiſſion; yet at preſent we
ſhall add no more, foraſmuch as we humbly
conceive what was before alleadged, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to convince all unprejudiced Perſons,
that a general Permiſſion will bring great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenicies
upon the Nation in general, as to
its Trade, and when that is done, no ways
anſwer the end propoſed by it.</p>
