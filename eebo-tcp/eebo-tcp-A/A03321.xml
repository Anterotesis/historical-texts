            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An aduertisement to the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Author of this Treatise was required by
some persons of honor, who might dispose of
him and his labours: to set downe by way of an
historicall narration, what hee had obserued
touching certaine positions holden, and some en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises
atchieued or vndertaken, for recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending,
and bringing the <hi>Presbiteriall Discipline</hi> into this Iland
of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> vnder pretence of reformation. The performance of
which dutie, when hee had vndertaken and was entred into it: hee
found the worke to grow farre greater vpon him, then at the first, he
did imagine. Insomuch as although in the beginning he verily sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
tha hee might easily haue contriued his matter into a few
sheetes of paper: so that as many coppies, as were to bee disposed,
might easily and in very short time haue beene written forth: yet by
the necessary length of the Discourse, as it fell out, and through his
manifold quotations, hee was constrained, (as the time required) to
procure for the better dispatch, that some fewe copies might bee prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And albeit there is no meaning, that this Treatise (laboured
but for the priuate satisfaction of some fewe especiall persons) should
otherwise continue then as an vnpublished Copie: yet the writer of
it wished to haue it signified, that nothing is alleadged therein, which
is not to be found either in Bookes and writinges published to the
view of the world, (such as he thinketh will not be disclaimed,) or in
publike records, or else is to be shewed vnder those parties own hands
that haue beene either the principall procurers, fauorers, or dealers
in those thinges, whereof hee intreateth. Which asseueration of his
thus made, he will be ready, (as he sayth) God assisting him, to iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
at any time for the satisfaction of such, as shall make doubt of it.
And doth further protest with all sinceritie: that he hath not (wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly)
detorted any thing in this whole Discourse, to make either the
cause it selfe, or the fauorors thereof more odious, then their owne
wordes and deeds shall necessarily inferre, and enforce against them,
with all indifferent and considerate Readers. <hi>Farewell in Christ.</hi>

               <head type="sub">Of two sortes of men that especially disturbe the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
and of the drifts of them both, by way of a Preface.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S it is said of <hi>Caiphas,</hi> when hee tolde his
companions the Pharisees and the rest,
that it was expedient for them, that <hi>one
man should die for the people, Hoc a seipso
non dixit, sed prophetauit, &amp;c.</hi> so in mine
opinion it may well be said of the Pope,
when he gaue to the Kings &amp; Queenes
of England this Title, to bee called <hi>Defenders of the faith:</hi>
he spake not this of himselfe, but prophecied. For if any
Christian King or Queene might euer bee truely so tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
(as in deed it is a stile that containeth a great and the
most royall part of all their kingly offices,) surely of all the
Princes that since that time haue raigned, it is verified
most properly in her most excellent Maiestie: Whether
you respect the Reformation of Religion, which her
Highnesse hath made in this Church of England (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the noble examples of <hi>Moses, Iosua, Dauid, Salomon,
Iosaphat, Ezechias, Iosias, &amp;c.</hi>) or whether you respect, not
onely the reliefe, which strangers persecuted at home for
the profession of the Gospell haue here receiued: or her
Maiesties great and vnspeakeable charges, for the ayding
and assisting of other Christian States, Princes, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries:
that for their profession of the same right Religion,
are mightily afflicted, by certaine Gyantes of the earth,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:774:6"/>
the souldiers and members of that Antichrist of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So as in these and many other respects (which do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
with them) I neither doubt that her Maiesty (whom
the Lord protect with his mighty hande long to raigne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
vs) shall bee for euer renowned amongst the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Queenes, that euer liued in the worlde: or that the
Church of England, so refourmed by her Highnesse, is
presently at this day the most Apostolike and flourishinge
Church, simply, that is in all Christendome. Howbeit let
a Church be as richly planted as euer any was, before, or
in the Apostles times: Let either <hi>Moses</hi> with his <hi>Aaron,</hi>
or <hi>Dauid</hi> with all his Councellors, gouerne both the
Church and Common-wealth, as godly as euer any was
gouerned: yet such is, and euer hath been, the malice and
cunning of Sathan: as that he wanteth not at any time, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will or meanes, to slaunder, to depraue, and to endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
the same. He hath his <hi>Core, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> that
if need bee,<note place="margin">Numb. 16</note> dare presume to tell both <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi>
they take too much vpon them. Hee is able to set the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of one father, the seruants of one master, the subiects
of one Prince, and the members of one Church; at dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
at deadly hatred amongst themselues. As occasion
serueth, hee hath his <hi>Shemeis</hi> to curse King <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sam. 16</note> also his
murmurers, complayners, mockers, makers of sectes, such
as <hi>despise gouernement,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iude 2. Pet. 2</note> which are presumptuous: men that
stand in their lewde conceits: such as feare not to speak e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
of those things they know not, and of them that are in
dignity, that is, of Princes and great men, be they neuer so
high in authority.</p>
               <p>The experience which wee haue hereof at this day in
the Church of England, is more then pregnant: partly
through the diuelish and traiterous practises of the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Priests and Iesuites: and partly by reason of the lewd
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:774:6"/>
and obstinate course, held by our pretended refourmers,
the Consistorian Puritanes: both of them labouring with
all their might, by rayling, libelling, and lying, to steale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the peoples harts from their gouernours, to bringe
them to a dislike of the present state of our Church, and
to drawe them into parts-taking: the one sort, for the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
of such directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as should come vnto them from
<hi>Rome:</hi> the other for the establishing of that counterfeit and
false Hierarchie, which they would obtrude vppon vs by
the countenance and name of the Church at <hi>Geneua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The which proceedings of both the sorts of disturbers,
are so much the more dangerous, in that they deale so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretely,
and haue combined themselues, together with
their Proselites, into such a league aud confederacy; as get
out what you can your felfe by meere chance (as they say)
for the discouery of their actions, and attempts; you shall
bee sure that neither the one sort nor the other will detect
any thing. Nay matters beeing detected in some sort to
their handes, they will vtterly refuse to bee examined, as
law prescribeth: or if they take any oathe, it is as good ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
a whit as neuer the better, they dally so exceedingly
with it.</p>
               <p>For vnder pretence of not accusing themselues, if they
finde any thing to be come to light, which may any waies
touch them, they will vtterly refuse for the most part to
answere it, either vpon oath or without oath: saying, that
neither by the Lawes of God, nor man, they are bound so
to answere. Vnder colour whereof they exempt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
from the ordinary course helde in iustice, for crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
causes, throughout all the world: which is, that before
witnesses be produced against any supposed offender, the
party accused shall first answere to the accusation, yea, or
nay, &amp;c. as wee vse in England, and that in matters of life
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:774:7"/>
and death (but in these without an oathe) hee must first
pleade guilty or not guilty.</p>
               <p>And as they deale for themselues, so doo they for their
confederates, their fauourers, relieuers, abetters, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers:
affirming it to be against the rules of charity, to bring
their Christian brethren and frends into any daunger, for
doing of those things, which both the sorts of these sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
haue drawne them into, and doo themselues iudge to
be religious and iust.</p>
               <p>From these points all the Iudges of the land, and diuers
Diuines that haue dealte with them, as yet cannot bringe
them: both the sorts are so setled in this seditious doctrine
of <hi>Rhemes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Annotat. Rhemish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the 23. of the Actes of the Apostles.</note> which is as followeth, vz. <hi>If thou be put to an oath,
to accuse Catholikes, for seruing God as they ought to doo, or to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
any innocent man, to Gods enemies and his, thou oughtest first
to refuse such vnlawfull oathes: but if thou haue not constancie,
and courage so to doo, yet know thou that such oathes binde not at
all in conscience and law of God, but may and must be broken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
paine of damnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in these confederacies, what course should be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for the preuenting of such daungers, as may thereby
ensue, I referre it to be throughly considered by those that
haue the gouernement both of the Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale
committed vnto them. But before they can be
preuented they must be vnderstood. Concerning the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary
Priests and Iesuites: their very comming into the
land doth declare their traiterous intentions. What allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
and loue soeuer they pretend (vppon their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension)
to her Maiesty and their countrey, it is very well
knowne, they doo it but for the time, <hi>rebus sic stantibus,</hi> &amp;
that their comming hether, is to no other purpose, but to
make away for the Pope and the Spaniardes; the sworne
and mortall enemies, both to this state, and to all other
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:774:7"/>
that doo professe the right refourmed religion of Christ.</p>
               <p>But for the other sort of practitioners, their proceedings
and designements, are not so well, as yet discouered. Their
pretences doo carry a greater shew of good meanings: &amp;
many (that are indeede truely zealous, little suspecting
what hookes doo lie hidde vnder such faire baites) are
dayly carried (as we see) headlong with them. In respect
whereof, you are to be aduertised, that as it is an easie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by looking to the said Popish and Spanish practises, to
knowe in generality, their Seminaries dealinges here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
vs, be they in particularity neuer so secrete: so are
there certaine men in other countries, of the same humors
with our pretended refourmers, whose courses and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
as wel for the matters they desire, as for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of attaining of them, they propound to themselues, as
the fittest patternes for them to followe: and namely the
Ministers of <hi>Geneua,</hi> but more especially some of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of <hi>Scotland:</hi> as may hereby appeare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As we haue beene an example, to the Churches of</hi> France <hi>and</hi>
Scotland (sayth M. Cartwright) <hi>to followe vs; so the Lorde

hope vpon the change of their former proceeding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It also appeareth that there is great and ordinary intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
betwixt their and our especiall presbyterie mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
for the better, and more ready compassing of such
deuises and platformes, as are sought for, by our said mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
so busily amongst vs. <hi>The best of our Ministerie</hi> (sayth

a Preacher of our Church this last summer</hi> (1590.) <hi>of purpose, to
conferre with the best affected Ministers of your Church, to laye
downe a plot, how our Church might best trauell for your reliefe.</hi>
And again: <hi>The Lord knows what care we haue of your Church
both in our publike and priuate praiers, &amp;c. For as feeling mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of one bodie, we reckon the affliction of your Church to be our
owne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One <hi>Dauison</hi> in like manner (an other minister of that
countrey) taketh vpon him to iustifie the proceedings of
our malecontent ministers here:<note place="margin">Dauison a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst R. B.</note> (as it shall herafter more
plainely appeare) and for the better incouraging of them
in their peeuishnes,<note place="margin">Pag. 29.</note> hee telleth them, <hi>that the iust defence of

                  <note place="margin">Pag. 29.</note> Hee doth also pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish

               <p>Lastly there is almost nothing more ordinary in all the

               <p>Which points considered, &amp; being required by those
that might command me, that whereas certaine writings,
and letters were come to my handes, concerning some
courses taken by our saide more friendly disturbers, then
the Iesuites are, but yet very great disturbers; I should
make the same in some sorte knowne: I thought it
my best way, for the discharging of my duety therein, first
to lay downe before you, the examples, patternes, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of those Ministers and Churches, which those
our factious crew, propound to themselues to follow: &amp;
secondly (that I may not bee enforced to passe by them,
as<note n="*" place="margin">Refor. no enemie. B. 2</note> one saith, D. B. was in his sermon at Paules crosse) to
make it most apparant vnto you, how artificially and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually,
they haue already by imitation expressed them.
Whereby you shall perceiue, that although by reason of
their said combination and secretnesse vsed, many things
lie hid from those in authority, which they haue done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
in the setting forward of their pretended discipline:
yet there will fall out so much to bee disclosed, as laying it

               <p>Thus farre then, it must needes be thought, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe
was offered by suche as soughte to refourme that
Church: which offer he refusing (as I gesse) to accept of,
they dealt (as it appeareth by the issue) with the inferiour
magistrates and people,<note place="margin">Cal. to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolet.</note> to make such a reformation them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
as they required of them. Whereupon the Bishop
beeing Lord of the City, and hauing aswell in his handes,
the Soueraigne ciuill Iurisdiction ouer it, or (as <hi>M. Caluin</hi>
speaketh) <hi>Ius gladij &amp; alias ciuilis iurisdictionis partes, &amp;c.</hi> as
the Ecclesiasticall; they saide, <hi>He was a thiefe and an vsurper;</hi>
and so of themselues, with such assistance as was procured,
did thrust him from both those authorities. Euen like (in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:774:9"/>
my opinion) as if a Christian Prince, being possessed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his dominions of the supreame Iurisdiction, as well in
Ecclesiasticall as in ciuill causes, might vpon the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
be serued in the same maner: or, to preuent all excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as if some Prince of some perticular state or City in
<hi>Germanie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioach. Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarius. Phil. Mela. Georg. Maior de vita eius.</note> taking vpon him, together with his principality,
the calling of a Preacher, Bishop, Superintendent or Ruler
of many perticular Churches, (as <hi>George</hi> the Prince <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hault</hi>
did) should in such a case (as the Bishoppe of <hi>Geneua</hi>
was) be depriued of both.</p>
               <p>The means which was vsed, for such their abandoning
of their Bishop, was this. When they perceiued that the
Bishop sought, by force to encounter their proceedinges,
and that (as <hi>Sleydan</hi> noteth) hee had excited the Duke of
<hi>Sauoy,</hi> to that ende, to assist him: they ioyned themselues
into a more neere amity with <hi>Berne.</hi> So as the Duke and
the Bishop comming together to besiege the City; they
were both repulsed, <hi>Bernatibus illis auxilium ferentibus, The
force of</hi> Berne <hi>assisting the</hi> Geneuians. Since which time (as

                  <note place="margin">Whittingham in his Preface to Goodmans booke. Knox.</note> (but contrary to the iudgement of all

Within a while<note n="e" place="margin">Knox p. 372</note> after, they consulted with their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,

               <p>Not long after this: the <hi>Queene Regent</hi> dyeth. And then

where there was neither Scepter, Crowne, nor Sworde

proceed much further, in the ripping vp of these and such

some peraduenture, will labour to excuse these manner of
proceedings, and to colour the same, with some pretence
of zeale, and great desire they had, to bee deliuered from
Popish Idolatry and Superstition: I haue rather thought
it conuenient to let you vnderstande, howe farre they are,

               <p>

               <p>As if<note n="t" place="margin">Ibid. pag. 56</note> a man should write to such Christians as are vnder the

in number fewe,<note place="margin">Note this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity</note> and generallie subiect to all kinde of iniuries:
would he not write as Paul did? So as the Apostle, did respect the
men he writt vnto: and his wordes are not to be extended, to the
body or people of a common wealth, or whole Citie.</p>

                  <hi>hee</hi>) that Paul were now aliue, where
both the King and people do professe Christianity, and that there
were such Kings, as would haue their becks to stand for lawes: as
cared neither for God nor man: as bestowed the Church reuenues
<hi>scurris &amp; balatronibus</hi> vpon iesters and rascalls, and such as gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
at those that did embrace the more sincere Religion: what
would he write of such to the Church? Surely except he would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
from himself, he would say, that he accounted no such for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates:
hee would forbidde all men for speaking vnto them, and
from keeping them companie: he would leaue them to their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
to be punished neither would he blame them, if they accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
no longer such for their Kings, as by the law of God, they could
haue no societie withall. <hi>And thus farre the answearer.</hi>

               <p>There are diuers other obiections against those refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:774:14"/>
which receiue almost as desperate answers. But I
will not at this time trouble you with them, especially if
you will giue me leaue to aduertise you, that this new Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity
of dealing thus with Princes, is not onely helde by
<hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Buchanan,</hi> but generally (for ought I can learne)
by most of the Consistorians of chiefe name beyonde the
Seas, who (being of the <hi>Geneua</hi> humor) doo endeuour by
most vniust &amp; disloyall meanes, to subiect to their forged
presbyteries, the scepters and swordes of Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
as <hi>Caluin, Beza, Hotoman, Vrsinus,</hi> (as he commeth out
from <hi>Newstadt). Vindiciae contra tyrannos, Eusebius Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,
&amp;c.</hi> For the further fruit of which Consistorian Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie,
(besides that which is sayd by some of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of <hi>Scotland</hi>) I referre you to the consideration of such

be authorized in the <hi>Bishops</hi> places, for the estate. They <hi>also

               <p>With these manner of proceedings, the King there, and
the State, finding great cause of iust discontentment and
danger: after diuers consultations and good deliberation,
order was taken about the yeare, 1582. for the checking
&amp; redressing of them. His Maiesty began to take vpon him
his lawfull authoritie, belonging to all Christian Princes,
in causes Ecclesiasticall. Wherupon he caused the foresaid
courses, held by the Ministers, to be examined and looked
into. And they were found to be such, as that <hi>some of them
were remoued from their charges,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Declaration 1582.</note> 
                  <hi>some were imprisoned, &amp; some
indighted. Commaundement was also giuen, that they should not
proceede, in the execution of their Ecclesiasticall censures, as they
had done. A Proclamation was made in diuers of the chiefest
places in the Realme, for discharging the Ministers of their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
conuentions and assemblies, vnder paine, to bee punished as
Rebels.</hi> They were published in that Proclamation, to be
<hi>vnnaturall subiects, seditious persons, troublesome and vnquiet
spirites, members of Sathan, enemies to the King, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
of their natiue countrey:</hi> and were <hi>charged to desist
from preaching, in such sort as they did,</hi> amongst other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
against the authoritie in Church causes, against the
calling of Bishops, &amp; for the maintenance of their former
proceedings.</p>
               <p>But the issue of the Kinges good intention to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed
these disorders, was this: In August 1582. his
Highnesse being drawn vnto a certain Noble mans house
to be feasted in Rutheuen: there <hi>he was surprised &amp; restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1584. cap. 7.</note>
Which attempt was qualified and tearmed (in <hi>a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
set out,</hi> 1582. to iustifie the same) <hi>to be onely a repaire
of the Kings faithfull subiects, to his Highnes presence, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine

               </p>
               <p>After a time, the King deliuered himselfe out of their
hands, that so had restrained him: and by the aduise of his
three estates assembled in Councell, (notwithstanding the
saide qualification or pretence of repayre) the action in it
self <hi>was iudged and published in December,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>With this his Maiesties course for Reformation, the
Disciplinarian faction was greatly displeased: and did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
in their Consistorian humour accordingly. In an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
of Ministers and Elders (forsooth) at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi>
shortly after, the State of the Realme was stoutly encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.
For although the King,<note place="margin">Declar. 1582</note> with the aduise of his estates,
had resolued the saide fact of surprising his Maiesties per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to be treasonable, <hi>yet the brethren did not onely authorise
and avow the same, but also, esteeming their owne iudgements, to
be the soueraigne iudgement of the Realme, did ordaine all them
to be excommunicated, that would not subscribe vnto that their
iudgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the same time,<note place="margin">Act of Parl. 1584. cap. 7.</note> or not long after, vz. in Aprill,
1583. <hi>there was another most treasonable conspiracie and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
attempted at</hi> Sterling, <hi>and intended to haue beene further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
and prosecuted against his Highnesse person:</hi> and all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence of Religion, and chiefly (in shewe) for the
Consistorian or Presbyteriall soueraignetie.</p>
               <p>With these and many more such vnduetifull insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
the King and State there, beeing greatly mooued: a
Parliament was called, and held in May, 1584. wherein
order was taken, for a generall Reformation in causes Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:774:17"/>
throughout the whole Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Kings<note n="u" place="margin">Act of Parl. cap. 2.</note> lawfull authority in causes Ecclesiasticall,
so often before impugned, was approued and confirmed;
and it was <hi>made treason,</hi> for any man to refuse to answere
before the King, though it were concerning any matter,
which was Ecclesiasticall.</p>
               <p>The third<note n="*" place="margin">ibid. cap. 20</note> estate of Parliament, (that is, <hi>the Bishoppes)
was restored to the auncient dignity:</hi> it was<note n="y" place="margin">ibid. cap. 3.</note> made <hi>treason,</hi> for
any man after that time to procure the <hi>innouation or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution</hi>
of the power and authority of any of the three e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The foresayd</hi>

                  <hi>iudgements, Senates, and Presbyteriall
iurisdictions were discharged: and it was enacted in these
words:</hi> that after that time none should presume, or take vppon
them to conuocate, conuene, or assemble themselues together, for
holding of Councells, conuentions, or assemblies, to treat, consult,
or determine in any matter of estate, ciuill or Ecclesiasticall, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
the ordinary iudgements:) without the Kinges especiall
commandement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">ibid cap. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>further then ordayned,</hi> that none of his Highnesse
subiects, in time comming, should presume to take vppon them by
worde or writing, to iustifie the most treasonable attempt at <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuen,</hi>
or to keepe in Register or store, any bookes approouing the
same in any sort.</p>
               <p>An Acte<note n="b" place="margin">ibid. cap. 8.</note> was also made, for the calling in of <hi>Buchanans
Chronicle,</hi> and his booke <hi>de iure regni apud Scotos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly (sayth the</hi> Acte<note n="c" place="margin">ibid. cap. 8.</note> of Parliament <hi>it selfe.</hi>) Foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as through the wicked, licentious, publike, and priuate spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and vntrue calumnies of diuers his Highnesse subiects, to the
disdaine, contempt, and reproach of his Maiestie, his Councell,
and proceedinges, stirring vp his Highnesse subiectes thereby, to
misliking, sedition, vnquietnes, to cast off their due obedience to
his Maiestie. Therefore it is ordained, that none of his subiects
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:774:17"/>
shall presume, or take vpon them, priuatelie or publikelie, in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
declamations, or familiar conferences, to vtter any false,
slanderous, or vntrue speeches, to the disdaine, reproach, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of his Maiestie, his Councell, and proceedings, or to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
in the affaires of his Highnesse vnder paine, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And thus you haue seene some part of the practise of
the <hi>Geneua</hi> resolution in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for their booke of <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline;</hi>
and reformation in Religion. But yet I must needes
draw you on a little further.</p>
               <p>Presently, after that the sayde Parliament was ended,
notwithstanding the kings maiesty, had in the same<note n="d" place="margin">cap. 1. of that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;c.</note> most
royally &amp; religiously co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed with great sincerity the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of true Religion, for preaching the worde, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of the sacraments accordingly, and had likewise
vnited to his Crowne, the supreame authority in all causes
within his Realme, aswell Ecclesiasticall as Ciuill: yet (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their Presbyterial soueraignty was therby abridged)
diuers very spitefull, disloyall, and slaunderous speeches
were cast abroade, by them and their associates, against his
Highnesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For they</hi>

<hi>that there was</hi> left nothing of the whole auncient forme of

many other the like reprochfull and calumnious reportes,
which they spread abroad in their owne Country.</hi>

that were fled out of <hi>Scotland</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> for feare of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
in respect of many their great and haynous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
pretended (as it hath beene noted) that they fledd

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:774:18"/>
One<note n="h" place="margin">M. Hutchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Letter and as he is readie to be deposed.</note> 
                  <hi>Dauison</hi> (a <hi>Scottish</hi> Minister) so rayled against
the King of Scots in the pulpit, at the parish Church of the
olde Iury in London, that vpon complaint made thereof,
by the Lord Ambassador of <hi>Scotland,</hi> direction was giuen
to the Lord Bishop of London, for the silencing of all the
<hi>Scottish</hi> Ministers in the City.</p>
               <p>And this disloyall and slaunderous course was helde,
both in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> so farre as they<note n="i" place="margin">Thinnes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, page. 446.</note> durst, from
May, vntill Nouember following.</p>
               <p>At what time, this stratagem here ensuing was wroght
(as I am perswaded) by the Consistorians instigation. The
King<note n="k" place="margin">ibid Thinn.</note> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> being vpon occasion of <hi>a contract,</hi> nere
<hi>Striueling:</hi> heard of certaine enemies <hi>(as hee then accounted
them)</hi> comming towards him. Whereupon his Maiesty
<hi>raysing such power as hee could, conuayed himselfe to</hi> Striueling.
Where before he looked for them, ten thousand men <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
themselues</hi> in armes. <hi>They pitched their Tents before the
towne the first of Nouember,</hi> and there made a Proclamation
in their owne names, commanding all the Kings subiects
to assist them. Many pretenses<note n="l" place="margin">The Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is there also set downe.</note> are alleaged of that their
attempt. And these namely: that whereas there had beene
<hi>Acts and Proclamations</hi> a little before <hi>published against the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie
and Clergie, inhibiting their Presbyteries, assemblies and
other exercises, priuileges, and immunities:</hi> and that <hi>the most
learned and honest were compelled, for safetie of their liues and
consciences, to abandon their Country, &amp;c.</hi> Nowe the <hi>afflicted
Church might be comforted, and all the said Acts lately made in
preiudice of the same, might bee solemnely cancelled, and for euer
adnulled.</hi> This Proclamation thus knowne, the King forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the towne as he could: but to no purpose. For within
two houres assault it was wonne. The King thereupon,
was enforced to flye <hi>vnto the Castle.</hi> The Conquerours of
the towne, <hi>placed their ensignes before the blockehouse of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:774:18"/>
Castle, and so ordred the matter, that there was no way for any in
the Castle to escape their hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherupon (a parley being concluded) the King desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by his Commissioners three petitions: The first,</hi> That
his life, honor, and estate might be preserued. <hi>The second,</hi> That
the liues of certain of his friends with him might not be touched.
<hi>The third,</hi> That all things might be transacted peaceably. <hi>The
other side, by their Commissioners likewise desired other
three petitions: The first,</hi> That the King would allow of their
intention, and subscribe their Proclamation, vntill further order
were established by the estates, &amp;c. <hi>and</hi> that he would deliuer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, all the strong Holds in the land. <hi>The second,</hi> That the
disquieters of the Common-wealth might be deliuered vnto them
and abide their due tryall by Law. <hi>The third.</hi> That the old guard
might be remooued, and another placed.</p>
               <p>Vppon mutuall relation from the Commissioners on
both sides, the parties that were assembled in armes, did
yeeld vnto the first and third of the Kings petitions: and
the King graunting to all theirs, as there was no remedy,
committed himself into their hands, and had a new guard
immediately appointed to attend him.</p>
               <p>And thus the Presbyteries of <hi>Scotland</hi> by the Kings sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
to the foresaid Proclamation,<note place="margin">This appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by Iames Gibsons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the King: pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered abroad in many Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies.</note> recouered againe a
great part of their strength. But not all (as it seemeth) vpon
the sodaine: which was the occasion of a new stirre. For
presently after the sayde Noble victory, the <hi>Scottish</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
that were in England, (hauing al their former disloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties
vppon composition remitted:) made their repayre
without delay into <hi>Scotland:</hi> where finding not such rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse
as they expected, for a more authenticall repealing
of the statutes made in the foresaid Parliament, 1584. they
began (notwithstanding the Kings late goodnes towards
them,) to exclaime in their Pulpits, with most proud and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:774:19"/>
bitter Inuectiues against him.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Iames Gibson,</hi> compared his Maiesty publikely in
his preachings, <hi>vnto Ieroboam,</hi> tearmed <hi>him a persecutor,</hi> and
<hi>threatned him,</hi> that if he tooke that course, he should be the
<hi>last of his race.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And being called for such his disloyall</hi> speeches,<note place="margin">Gibson hath penned this matter as Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sistorianly, as Catiline him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe could haue done it.</note> 
                  <hi>before
the King &amp; Councell, the xxj. of December, 1585. he very
boldly iustified the same: saying to his Highnesse,</hi> As long
as you maintayne these cursed Actes of 1584. the tyranny of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
&amp;c. Ye are a Persecutor. <hi>And againe,</hi> As Ieroboam for the
leading of the people of Israell from the lawes of the house of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,
and from the true worshipping of God, to serue Idolatry, was
rooted out, he and all his posterity: so should the King) if he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in that cursed course, maintaining those wicked Acts against
God) be rooted out, and conclude that race, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What else hath fallen out since that time, by reason of
the raines, which now (as it hath beene noted) these zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
brethren haue gotten to themselues, and how mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
and duetifully they doo proceede, in the practise of
their Presbyteries, and Consistorian Kingdomes: the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
which the King not long since offred vnto the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
to haue beene subscribed vnto by them, doo suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
declare and make manifest.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The coppie of these articles, was deliuered abroad by some of her Maiesties pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie Counsell.</note> Ex malis moribus nascun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
bonae leges: Out of ill maners spring good and wholsome lawes.
<hi>The chiefe and especiall pointes of the sayde articles are
these: that</hi> all Preachers there, should yeelde their obedience to
the Kings Maiesty: <hi>that</hi> they should not pretend any Priuiledge in
their allegeance: <hi>that</hi> they should not meddle in matters of State:
<hi>that</hi> they should not publikely reuile his Maiesty: <hi>that</hi> they should
not draw the people from their due obedience to the King: <hi>&amp;</hi> that
when they are accused, vpon their facts or speeches, or for refusing
to doo things, &amp;c. <hi>they</hi> should not alledge the inspiration of the
holy spirit, nor serue themselues with colour of conscience but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:774:19"/>
their offences as men, and to craue pardon as subiects, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It is great pitty, that so worthy a Christian King, should
be driuen to require such a subscription in his owne king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
especially of those men, that should be lights to the
rest, and the chiefe examples of all duetifull obedience: It
is more to be pittied, that (for ought I can learne) his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty
cannot as yet obtaine so much at their handes. But
most of all it is to be lamented, that no man can gesse (for
ought I know) how far this Gangrene will spread it selfe.</p>
               <p>At the first, they found but faults against the <hi>Bishops,</hi> but
after they ouerthrewe them. The <hi>Anabaptists in Germany
began with the Bishops and Clergy,</hi>

And thus much of the manner and wayes vsed by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Scottish Ministers, for Reformation and Discipline.
Which pointes or Consistorian proceedinges, I haue not
touched (as God knoweth) with any minde or intent, to
dishonour the state of that Country. Besides, much may
well be sayd (I assure my selfe) in excuse of such of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity;
as ioyned in the premisses. For I finde they were led
with a very great zeale. They had beene so long impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the darkenesse of Popery, that when the Gospell
appeared vnto them, it so dazeled their eyes, as that for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
gladnesse they considered not well, what they did, so
they might enioy it. Their goods, their lands, their wiues
and their children, nay their liues (in respect therof) were
not greatly deare vnto them.</p>
               <p>Moreouer it is manifest, how long they were exercised
with great feare and many perplexities, what entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and continuance the Gospell should finde amongst
them. In which case euery man may easily coniecture, how
easie a matter it was for them, to be miscaried by their tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
&amp; Preachers: perswading them, that by Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
they were bound to vndertake that course, &amp;
withall not omitting great threates of excommunication
&amp; damnation, if they refused so to doo. They found their
sayd Ministers doctrine very good and sound, in the chiefe
points of saluation, and who would then haue suspected
them in matters of lesse importance?</p>
               <p>So as whatsoeuer was done amisse by them, as touching
their proceedings mentioned, I doo (wholly in a manner)
ascribe it to their Ministers of the <hi>Geneua</hi> learning. Vnto
whom also it ought of right to be imputed, that I or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
either haue, or hereafter shall haue, any occasion at all
so much as once to make mention of the least thing, that
might be any waies offensiue to the meanest of that natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:774:21"/>
For what had I, or any other priuate man in England,
to doo with their matters, otherwise then to haue prayed
for them: had their sayd Ministers, but onely taken vppon
them to haue iustified their sayde proceedinges, by their
owne Lawes, customes, and priuiledges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and could haue
contented themselues to haue gone no further? Marry
nowe that the chiefest of them,<note place="margin">Buchanan. The historie of the church of Scotland. Knox.</note> for the excusing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and that they might shew, whose schollers they are,
haue presumed to publish (and that in print) such strange
&amp; seditious doctrine, as doth tend to the like disturbance,
and indeede to the vtter ouerthrow of the freest and most
absolute Monarchies, that are or can be in Christendome,
not omitting withall, to solicite and incourage our preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
reformers in England, to proceed as they haue begun,
in following their steps, contrary (I am sure) both to the
word of God, and to all the lawes and customes of this
Realme: I am in very good hope, that there is no man of
any sound iudgement, who will be offended with mee, in
that to disclose, and thereby to preuent such mischiefes, as
might otherwise ensue with vs, I haue beene bolde to lay
downe (but yet out of their printed bookes) some of the
proceedinges of the sayde Ministers of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which at
this time our owne Preachers in England, of the Discipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narian
consort, (as nowe it followeth to bee shewed) doo
take vppon them to imitate, and haue already proceeded
further in them, then some of their fauorers will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

howe <hi>M. Knox</hi> beeing at <hi>Geneua</hi> in

would or no: yea though it were by putting her to death:</hi> Out of

               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:774:22"/>
All men,<note place="margin">Goodman. Page 73.</note> councellors, noble men, inferior magistrates, and
people are bound and charged, to see the lawes of God kept, and to
suppresse and resist Idolatrie,<note place="margin">ibid. pag. 74.</note> by force.<note place="margin">ibid. pag. 77.</note>
               </p>
               <p>If the magistrates shall refuse,<note place="margin">ibid. pag. 196</note> to put massemongers and false
preachers to death, the people (in seeing it performed) doo shewe
that zeale of God, which was commended in <hi>Phinees,</hi> destroying
the adulterers, and in the <hi>Israelites</hi> against the <hi>Beniamites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To teach,<note place="margin">ibid. page 30.</note> that it was not lawfull in any case to resist the superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
powers, but rather to submit our selues to punishment is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
doctrine, taught by some, by the permission of God for our
sinnes.</p>
               <p>It is not sufficient for subiects,<note place="margin">ibid. page 63. 43. 59. 72.</note> not to obey wicked commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of their Princes, but to withstand them also, in dooing the
contrarie, euerie man in his vocation and office.</p>
               <p>Shieriffes,<note place="margin">ibid. page 87. 88, 89. 90.</note> Iaylors, and other inferior officers, ought not onely
not to cast the saintes of God in prison (hauing commandement
thereunto by the Prince) for feare of loosing their offices: but to
withstand euill, to support them, and to deliuer them, to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
of their power.</p>
               <p>If we see a sheepe in daunger to be deuoured of a wolfe,<note place="margin">ibid. page 90.</note> wee are
bounde to deliuer it: euen so to our power wee are bound to put to
our hands, to deliuer the children of God, when wee see them piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouslie
in danger, by Gods enemies.</p>
               <p>It is the office of Councellors,<note place="margin">ibid. page 34. page 35.</note> to bridle the affections of Princes
and gouernors: Noblemen were first ordained to bridle Princes.
Noblemen haue their honour of the people, to reuenge the iniuries
of their Kings,<note place="margin">Obedience. page. 107.</note> and not for their lustie hawking, nimble dicing &amp;
carding, singing and dauncing, open bragging &amp; swearing, false

               <p>The authoritie,<note place="margin">Obedience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 25.</note> which Princes haue, is giuen them from the

               <p>If Magistrates without feare transgresse Gods laws themselues,
and command others to doo the like;<note place="margin">ibid. pag. 119. 139.</note> then haue they lost that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

them: and ought no more to be taken for Magistrates, but be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,

them, for their crimes: and to proceed against them, as against all

               <p>Euill Princes ought (by the lawe of God) to bee deposed,<note place="margin">Goodman, 144. 145.</note> and

othes, or handwritings, furder then a man doth see, &amp; hear them,
&amp; scarsely so far.</hi> And <hi>Goodman</hi> likewise, for his conclusion,
is most earnest with all english subiectes, that they would
put his doctrine in practise, assuring them that in so doing,
if they be cast <hi>in prison with</hi> Ioseph,<note place="margin">Pag. 218. 219. 220. 221.</note>

remayneth, that I shew vnto you, how far (as yet it is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed)

haue taken the like course in her Highnesse time: mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
principally, by such vile slaunders, to withdraw her
Highnesse subiects, from their dutifull approbation of the

               <p>
                  <hi>Goodman, Wittingham, Gilby,</hi> the author of the booke
of obedience, with the rest of the <hi>Geneua</hi> complices in
Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, practised the very same pollicie:
when (as you haue heard) according to the <hi>Allobrogicall</hi>
resolution, they vrged all states, by degrees, rather to take
armes, and to reforme Religion themselues by force, then
to suffer such Idolatrie and superstition to remaine in the
land.</p>
               <p>But in these more political then Christian practises, as
I said, that our English <hi>Disciplinarians</hi> of these dayes, haue
farre exceeded the <hi>Scottish</hi> Ministers: so may it bee truely

haue written, and all the said <hi>Geneuians</hi> that then liued,
for malitious and spitefull tauntes, for rayling and bitter
tearmes, for disdaineful and contemptuous speeches, did
not come neere them.</p>
               <p>Besides, it is especially to be obserued, that in their own

then one of ours; though he haue the great bell rong, and

               </p>
               <p>They might as well haue signified vnto vs, in what
tearmes and reputation, her Maiestie, her Parliaments, her
Lords, her Iudges, and her lawes, do stand and hold with
the people. In dealing as they haue done, by their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

their LL<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. their intents to that purpose, when the time

(eyther truely or falsely) many great crimes to his charge:
&amp; afterward should by Printing or any other waies pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
it: could otherwise account of his dealing therein,
but that he meant to make him thereby odious to the

               <p>Queene <hi>Marie</hi> was of nature &amp; disposition, very mild

&amp; the rest of the <hi>Geneuians</hi> against her, concerning her

and in time prouided-for accordingly: conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that these our home-bred Sicophantes, men of the
<hi>Geneua</hi> mould, as proud and presumptuous as any that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerliued,
do charge the present state, vnder her Maiestie,
(as before it is noted) with such great impietie, corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
idolatrie, superstition, and barbarous persecution:
Which may touch her highnesse, as neerely (by their

               <p>Well the conclusion of this Booke is this, vz: that seeing

               <p>About the twelfth yeare of her highnesse said gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
these malecontents, growing weary of the foresaide
dissentions, and being of restlesse dispositions, began to stir
vp new quarrels, concerning the <hi>Geneua</hi> Discipline: being
the matter indeede which they still aymed at, in all their
former proceedings. Herevpon, (the 14. of her Maiesty)
two <hi>admonitions</hi> were framed, and exhibited to the high
Court of Parliament. The first contayned their pretended
griefes, with a declaration (forsooth) of the onely way to
reforme them: vz. by admitting of that platforme, which
was there described.</p>
               <p>This admonition, finding small entertainement, (the
authors or chief preferrers thereof being imprisoned) out
commeth the second <hi>admonition,</hi> towardes the end of the
same Parliament: with great lightning and thunder, as
though heauen and earth shoulde haue met together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the little regard which was had before, to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>admonition.</hi> In this second <hi>admonition,</hi> the first is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
iustified: the Parliament (as it hath beene shewed) is
mightily challenged: great wordes are vsed, and in plaine
tearmes, it is there affirmed: That if they of that assembly
woulde not then followe the aduise of the first <hi>admonition,</hi>
they would surely themselues be their owne caruers. <hi>The
Church</hi> (say they) <hi>may and must keepe God his orders:</hi>

speake for it, and to vse it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon, presently after the sayd Parliament, (vz.
the twentieth of Nouember, 1572.) there was a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
erected at <hi>Wandesworth in Surrey</hi> (as it appeareth by a
bill endorsed with <hi>Master Fields</hi> hande, thus: <hi>the order of
Wandesworth.</hi>) In which order the Elders names, eleuen of
them, are set downe: the manner of their election is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
the approuers of them, (one <hi>Smith of Micham,</hi> and
<hi>Crane of Roughampton</hi>) are mentioned: their offices and
certaine generall rules, (then giuen vnto them to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued)

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hilest the brethren in the Countrey,
were comming thus fast on forward (as
you haue heard in the ende of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Chapter:) you must not thinke
that the <hi>Rabbies</hi> in <hi>London</hi> were in the
mean time idle. Hitherto it should
seeme, that in all their former proceedings, they had relied
chiefly, vpon the <hi>first admonition</hi> and <hi>Cartwrights</hi> booke: as
hauing had no particular and seuerall platforme, that was
generally allowed of amongst them, for the Church of
<hi>England.</hi> But now at the length, (about the yeare, 1583.)
the <hi>forme of Discipline</hi> (which is lately come to light) was
compiled: and thereupon an assembly or Councell being
helde (as I thinke at <hi>London,</hi> or at <hi>Cambridge</hi>) certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
were made, concerning the establishing and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
thereof. In which decrees, mention is made of a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection;
concluded vpon for the <hi>Scottish</hi> Ministers, fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues
here in <hi>England,</hi> 1583. (which sheweth the time
when they were made:) &amp; order is likewise taken for the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:774:40"/>
putting in vse of the <hi>Synodicall Discipline;</hi> which also proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
the age of that booke.</p>
               <p>The decrees themselues are extant to bee seene, vnder
Maister <hi>Wights</hi> hande; a man of that brotherhood. But it
may not be omitted, that you must thinke; how the godly
brethren in all these and such other their zealous courses,
had neuer any meaning to disturbe the present state esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished.
And thereupon (forsooth) in this conspiracy or
councell mentioned, (like good and quiet spirited men)
they had an especiall care, that the peace of the <hi>Church</hi>
might not be broken, by any order or decree of theirs. So
as then the question amongst them was, (seeing the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
must needs vp) how farre they might proceede in
the establishing and practise of it, keeping notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the peace of the <hi>Church,</hi> established already by her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty.
And it was ouerruled accordingly, as it followeth in
the decrees themselues, faithfully translated, worde for
word, out of their owne Latin coppy.</p>
               <p>The title thereof, vz.</p>
               <p>These be the thinges, that (doo seeme) may well stande with the

                  <p>Let no man (though he be an <hi>Vniuersity</hi> man) offer himself
to the Ministery, nor let any man take vpon him an vncertaine
and vague Ministery, though it be offered vnto him. But such
as bee called to the Ministery by some certaine Church, let them
impart it vnto that <hi>Classis</hi> or <hi>conference,</hi> (wherof themselues
are,) or else vnto some greater <hi>Church assembly:</hi> and if such
shall be found fit by them, then let them bee commended, by their
letters vnto the <hi>Bishop,</hi> that they may bee ordayned Ministers
by him.</p>
                  <p>Those ceremonies in the Booke of <hi>common prayer,</hi> which
being taken from Popery, are in controuersie, doo seeme, that they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:774:40"/>
ought to bee omitted and giuen ouer, if it may bee done without
danger, of being put from the Ministery. But if there be any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
danger to be depriued, then this matter must bee commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
with the <hi>Classis,</hi> in which that Church is: that by the
iudgement thereof, it may be determined, what ought to be done.</p>
                  <p>If subscription to the <hi>articles of Religion,</hi> and to the <hi>booke
of common Prayer,</hi> shall be againe vrged: it is thought, that
the <hi>booke of articles,</hi> may be subscribed vnto, according to the
statute 13. Eliz. that is, vnto such of them onely, as containe the
summe of Christian faith, and doctrine of the Sacraments. But for
many waighty causes, neither the rest of the articles in that booke,
nor the <hi>booke of common prayer,</hi> may be allowed: no, though
a man should be depriued of his Ministery for it.</p>
                  <p>It seemeth, that <hi>Churchwardens</hi> and <hi>Collectors</hi> for the
poore, might thus be turned into <hi>Elders</hi> and into <hi>Deacons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When they are to be chosen, let the Church haue warning fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
dayes before, of the time of election, and of the ordinance of
the Realme: but especially of Christs ordinance, touching appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of watchmen and ouerseers in his Church: who are to foresee,
that none offence or scandall doo arise in the Church: and if any
shall happen, that by them it may be duely abolished.</p>
                  <p>And touching <hi>Deacons</hi> of both sorts (vz. men and women)
the Church shall be monished, what is required by the <hi>Apostle:</hi>
and that they are not to choose men, of custome and of course, or
for their riches, but for their faith, zeale, and integrity: and that
the Church is to pray, (in the meane time) to be so directed, that
they make choise, of men that be meete.</p>
                  <p>Let the names of such as are so chosen, be published, the next
<hi>Lords day:</hi> and after that, their dueties to the Church, and the
Churches towards them, shall be declared: then let them be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
vnto the Ministery, to which they are chosen, with the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

                  <p>The Brethren are to be requested, to ordaine a distribution of

all Churches, according to these rules, (in that behalfe) that are

                  </p>
                  <p>Also, they are to deale earnestly with patrones, to present fit

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Comitiall assemblies</hi> are to bee monished, to make col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections

reliefe of such Ministers here, as are put out, for not subscribing to

Ministers and others, and for other profitable and necessary vses.</p>
                  <p>All the <hi>prouinciall Synodes,</hi> must continually, afore hand,

whensoeuer the <hi>Parliament</hi> for the kingdome shall be called, and
at some certaine set time euere yeare.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto the <hi>Decrees</hi> of this graue <hi>Councell,</hi> whereby it
seemeth to me, that when they resolued, they might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
thus farre, and keepe (notwithstanding) the peace
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> established: they opposed (in
that resolution) the worde <hi>peace,</hi> to <hi>warre:</hi> as though they
should haue agreed, how far they might runne on in this
race, without vrging of their followers, to force &amp; armes.
For otherwise, how could any sober men, so much as once
haue imagined, that they might, in this sort, ouerthrow (in
effect) the present gouernement, and establish their owne
deuises, and yet neuer breake the peace of the Church?
But I will not presse this point. It is more agreeable to my
purpose to pursue the chase.</p>

               <p>I haue already entred into the matters, whereof you write, and
dealt with three or foure of seuerall <hi>Colleges,</hi> concerning those
among whom they liue. I finde, that men are very dangerous in
this point generally fauoring reformation: but when it commeth
to the particular point, some haue not yet considered of these
things, for which others in the Church are so much troubled: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:774:42"/>
are afraid to testifie any thing with their hands, least it breed
danger before the time. And <hi>after:</hi> many fauour the cause of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
but they are not Ministers, but young students, of whome
there is good hope, if it be not cut off by violent dealing before the
time. As I heare by you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so I meane to goe forward, where there is
any hope, and to learne the number, and to certifie you thereof.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, at the time of the <hi>Parliament</hi> last mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
I finde, that there was a <hi>nationall Synode</hi> helde likewise
in <hi>London</hi> by these brethren: according to their former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisions
and <hi>Synodicall</hi> Discipline. This appeareth by three
letters. The first was, from <hi>eleuen ministers of Essex,</hi> to <hi>Field:</hi>
wherin they desire to <hi>be certified,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">26. Ia. 1584.</note> 
                  <hi>whether the brethren meant
to be exercised, in prayer and fasting, and vpon what day.</hi> The
seconde was, from <hi>nine of the saide</hi> Ministers, to Fielde and
Charke:<note place="margin">2. Febru. 1584.</note> wherein they writ thus: <hi>We haue elected two Godly
and faithfull brethren, Maister Wright and Maister Gifford,
to ioyne with you in that businesse.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">29. Nouemb. 1584.</note> The third was, from <hi>Geli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand,
to Field:</hi> Wherein he excuseth himselfe of a great o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersight,
in these words. <hi>Touching my departure from that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
assembly without leaue, &amp;c. I craue pardon, both of you &amp; them,
&amp;c. And thus</hi> (sayth he) <hi>commending this holy cause to the Lord
himselfe, and your godly counsaile to the President thereof, I take
my leaue.</hi>

The maner of euery perticular <hi>Classis</hi> is this. At<note n="b" place="margin">M. Sharpe and M. Litle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton doe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise herein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with M. Iohnson.</note> their mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
(which is alwaies in some priuate house, but yet in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Cities) first a moderator is chosen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in this sort: one of them
conceiueth a praier, for Gods direction in that choyse.</p>
               <p>Then he, that conceiued the praier, sitteth alone in scrutonie:
and euery one giueth his voice secretlie vnto him. He that hath
most voyces is chosen.</p>
               <p>The moderator, thus chosen, conceiueth another praier: that
God would blesse him in the course of his office. Then being set at
the tables end, with his brethren by him: the names of all the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
are called. If any were absent at their first sitting downe, he
sitteth after in order, as he commeth, for auoiding of superioritie.</p>
               <p>The authoritie of the moderator endureth vntill the next mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of that <hi>Classis.</hi> At the breaking vp of euery <hi>Classis,</hi> there is
euer some certaine time appointed, when they shall meete againe:
which is sometime within a fortnight, but commonly three weeks
at the furthest: If any thing do fall out in the meane time, fit to be
consulted vpon: the moderator may call the <hi>Classis</hi> together soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
according to an order made amongst themselues.</p>
               <p>It is<note n="a" place="margin">Mast. Litle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton deposeth as much.</note> a generall order, that when any is admitted into a <hi>Clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis:</hi>
he doth promise vnder his hand, that he will submit himselfe,
and be obedient to all such orders and decrees, as shall be set down
by the same <hi>Classis</hi> to be obserued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for example:</hi> these were part of the particular articles,
whereunto euerie one of <hi>Northampton Classis</hi> did subscribe, at
his entring or admittance into it: we doo promise to submit our
selues, vnto such orders and decrees, as shall be set downe by our
<hi>Classis:</hi> We do promise to submit our selues, to be censured by our
brethren of this <hi>Classis,</hi> in all matters concerning doctrine and
Discipline, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In this Classis</hi> it was furthermore concluded and agreed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that when any controuersie did arise, touching any matters of
doctrine, or about the interpretation of any place of Scriptures: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:774:44"/>
one of that <hi>Classis,</hi> should alwaies yeeld therein, vnto that
interpretation and resolution, which the brethren of that <hi>Classis</hi>
should determine of. And so also when any questions did rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest
them of greater difficultie. As for example, Maister
<hi>Stone</hi> mooued this question to the <hi>Northampton Classis</hi> in
the behalfe of one: vz. two are contracted: one of them marrieth
with a third: hee or shee so married are free againe. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is: whether the former contract, doo nowe againe binde.
And the resolution was: it did not: <hi>which was a false Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The determinations and acts concluded vpon in this <hi>Classis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mast. Sharpe to the same purpose of Dauentry Classis.</note>
were registred in a booke by <hi>Snape:</hi> chosen <hi>Register</hi> by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie,
and who alwaies kept the same.</p>
               <p>Besides these perticular <hi>Classes,</hi> there is another kind of mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
which is termed the <hi>Assembly.</hi> And it consisteth (for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
in <hi>Northamptonshire,</hi> of the number of six: that is two of
euery <hi>Classis,</hi> which are sent thither by election. The ordinarie
place of this assembly in <hi>Northa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptonshire,</hi> was at <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton:</hi>
where <hi>Snape</hi> commonly was one, and a chiefe man, <hi>Barbon</hi>
&amp; <hi>King,</hi> were the men that vsually came from <hi>Dauentry</hi> side:
and <hi>Stone</hi> and <hi>Williamson</hi> from <hi>Kettring</hi> side.</p>
               <p>At the meeting of the sixe, there is alwaies a moderator first
chosen, in manner and forme, as in the <hi>Classis:</hi> and so likewise
for their further order of proceeding. The moderator continueth
his authoritie, ouer all the three <hi>Classes,</hi> vntill the like meeting
happen again: which is neuer certain. But yet commonly within six
or eight weeks, vpon occasion signified from the <hi>Classes</hi> vnto this
moderator. For vnto him belongeth the calling of this <hi>assembly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The matters, which here are handled, are those of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
such as concerne the state of the Church generally. As for
example: the writing of letters to the brethren at <hi>Oxford,
Cambridge,</hi> &amp; <hi>London:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The like Ma. Sharpe of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentry Classis</note> to certifie them of their proceedings,
&amp; to know what course is held amongst them, in those places, for
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:774:45"/>
the Discipline and gouernement, which they tearme <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>)
to the intent, that the particular <hi>Classes,</hi> vpon their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertisements,
may direct themselues, and their Churches accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
               <p>It is likewise alwaies concluded, at such times, which of the sixe
assembled, shall penne the letters. And in this choise, <hi>Snape</hi> was
commonly the man.</p>
               <p>The men, to whom they vsuallie did write: were one in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge;
Trauers</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Gelibrand</hi> in <hi>Oxford:</hi>
When any answeres were returned from those places: they were
commonly directed to <hi>Snape,</hi> or to him that had written to them,
in the name of the brethren.</p>
               <p>Two especiall points (I remember) were concluded in this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie:
the one was, for a suruay of all the Churches in <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamptonshire:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. Sharpe to to the same purpose of Dauentrie Classis.</note>
th'other, for an order to bee obserued at the last
<hi>Parliament,</hi> which then drew neere.</p>
               <p>The suruay was, to know what euerie benefice in the shire was
worth, how many soules by a generall coniecture, were in euerie
parish: who were the incumbents, and of what life, paines and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
they were. To this purpose, the fittest men, and such as were
best acquainted in the shire were nominated: as <hi>Litleton</hi> for
<hi>Haddon</hi> Deanerie, &amp;c. Which duetie he performed for his part
to the vttermost: and brought a most rayling Discourse, against
euery Minister, which was not of our companie.</p>
               <p>The end propounded of this suruey, was: vz. that if vpon sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
to the brethren abroad, what was done there: they would
likewise make the like suruey in other countries: the <hi>Parliament</hi>
(if neede required, and to the better furthering of their purposes)
might haue a generall viewe, of all the Ministers in <hi>England,</hi>
that impugned their desires.</p>
               <p>The second point before mentioned was this: vz. a conclusion
to send vp to <hi>London,</hi> one or two of euerie <hi>Classis</hi> in <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamptonshire,</hi>
with letters of credite, to attend at the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:774:45"/>
to ioine themselues with the brethren of other countries:
and to offer disputation, (if it should be so thought meete) and to
vndertake any other such matter, as should then and there be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
of amongst them: and that there should be letters writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
of this resolution, to know how the brethren abroad liked it:
or what other course they would hold, at that time, for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in of Discipline and Church gouernement.</p>
               <p>These two points, were penned by <hi>Snape:</hi> and sent to the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
abroad, as it was ordered.</p>
               <p>What answere was returned to <hi>Snape,</hi> from the brethren in
<hi>Oxford</hi> &amp; <hi>Cambridge,</hi> I know not: but well I remember, that
<hi>Trauerse</hi> did write to <hi>Snape,</hi> a very cunning Letter: wherein
he shewed himselfe not to mislike the foresaid suruay to be general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
made, but signified, that the Parliament drawing on so fast, it
could not be done so soone. But for the second point: that (he writ)
was liked, and meete to be followed.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the <hi>Classes</hi> of <hi>Northamptonshire,</hi> did send vp
some three or fower, as <hi>Settle</hi> for <hi>Northampton, Rogers</hi> for
<hi>Dauentry,</hi> &amp;c. with a further conclusion, that if any of them
(vpon occasion) should be committed, others should be sent vp in
their places.</p>
               <p>Although the time was short,<note place="margin">This suruey hath beene made in the most shires of England: as by the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be shewed it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth. They are in maner of heathnish libels.</note> for the generall accomplishing
of these forenamed pointes: yet this examinate thinketh, some
thing was done in the first: vz. as hee hath heard, a suruay was
made to the purpose before touched, of the Ministers in <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke,
Suffolke</hi> and <hi>Essex.</hi> And for the second, true it was, that
many were sent to attend at the <hi>Parliament,</hi> from the most parts
of England. And one resolution was, that some twenty or thirty of
them, should haue come in their gownes, with all grauitie, to the
<hi>Parliament</hi>-house-dore; and there haue desired by petition a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, concerning some censures vsed, there was a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
consent and purpose, amongest the brethren, touching a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:774:46"/>
kinde of excommunication: for examples sake. A lay man
committeth some sinne. One of the Elders was to admonish him.
The partie is obstinate. The Elder must take two or three with
him the second time. And if this serue not, then he is to be debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from the communion. In this case, if the said party shuld (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding)
intrude himselfe to communicate, then it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
to repell him, vppon pretence of certaine words in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
booke. So as thereby, they might keepe their owne course,
for their Discipline, and yet haue a cloake to couer them withall,
out of the booke.</p>
               <p>Againe, an other thing is notable to this effect. About a
yeare and a halfe a goe, <hi>Iohn Nelson</hi> of <hi>Northampton,</hi> an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
or a Deacon of Saint <hi>Peters,</hi> (as I thinke) hauing eyther his
daughter, or his sister gotten with childe, in his house, by one of
his seruants, Master <hi>Snape</hi> dealt with the said seruant, to vrge
him to publicke repentaunce: and at the last, so farre preuailed
with him, (as it was thought,) that he promised the next sunday
so to doe: but came not. Whereupon <hi>Snape</hi> made a verie bitter
Sermon against him. The next Sonday he came indeede. And
then <hi>Snape</hi> made a long praier, that God would giue him grace,
to make a faithfull acknowledgement of his sinne &amp;c. That done,
the penitentiary, made publique confession &amp;c. Which being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed,
<hi>Snape</hi> absolued him; and then entred into a great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
how cleare the partie was, and free from that sinne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
euen as though he had bin newlie born: charging the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
that no man should presume, at any time after, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
the same vnto him. But that, which was most wondred at:
whereas this poore man was thus dealt withall, <hi>Snape</hi> caused
lame Prettie, a Souldier of Barwicke (who without any calling
in the Church at all, sauing that he had a tolleration to read, did
such seruice in that place, as was appointed by <hi>Snape</hi> to bee read,
till he came to Church) the next morning to marrie the saide pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentiarie
to the woman with childe before named, without anie
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:774:46"/>
bringing of her, vnto anie such publicke repentance. Hereof, grew
amongst the people great speech, that the pore man was so vsed, &amp;
the cicher mans sister or daughter was so freed. The saide lame
Souldier, hath married manie in that place, vpon <hi>Snapes</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement:
for that <hi>Snape</hi> holdeth, that dutie to appertaine
no more to the Ministers office, then to anie other man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And as touching that point mentioned, of the brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens
submitting of themselues, by subscription, to be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
in their</hi> Classis: <hi>it was thus vsed in the</hi> Northampton
Classis. The brethren being together in a chamber, the partie to
be first censured, <hi>(as they were all to be in course)</hi> goeth forth
out of the chamber. Then the moderator asketh euery mans o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of him: how he behaueth himselfe aswell in his life, as in
his Ministerie: and euerie man, hauing spoken his opinion, the
partie is called in: and then, if he were not any way touched, he is
greatly commended: if otherwise, then reprooued, as the causes
require. For example, <hi>Edwards</hi> of <hi>Cortnall</hi> comming vnder
this censure, was blamed for vsing the Crosse in Baptisme: and at
his comming-in againe, was wonderfull sharpely dealt withall for
the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus farre</hi> Maister Iohnson <hi>of the</hi> Northampton Classis.
<hi>With whom doe also agree in the principall points:</hi> Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

or foure small <hi>Classes</hi> of Ministers in euery shire, where there
were any learned Preachers, who did vse (in their meetinges) to
debate of the Discipline, by Pastors, Doctors, Elders, &amp; Deacons,
and that the said seuerall small <hi>Classes,</hi> did send their resolutions
and opinions, to the greater assemblies at <hi>Cambridge</hi> at <hi>Stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>
Fayre time, and at <hi>London</hi> at <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Fayre

if the said great <hi>assembly</hi> did like of that, which was done by the
smaller <hi>Classes,</hi> then was the same (so liked of) generally conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
to be that, which ought to be, or stand, in the Church. <hi>(As for
example.)</hi> That it was concluded and agreed vpon, both in the
said <hi>Classicall</hi> and <hi>generall assemblies;</hi> that the dumbe mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie
was no ministerie, or else no lawfull ministerie: and that the

tending to the erecting of the foresaid gouernement, by <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,

trouble my paper with the fourme which they vsed, but
these were some of their resolutions: vz.</p>
               <p>That priuate Baptisme is vnlawfull.</p>
               <p>That it is not lawfull, to read homilies in the Church.</p>
               <p>That the signe of the Crosse, is not to be vsed in Baptisme.</p>
               <p>That the faithfull ought not to communicate with vnlearned</p>
               <p>ministers, although they may be present at their seruice, if they
come of purpose to heare a sermon. The reason is, because lay men,
aswell as ministers, may read publike seruice.</p>
               <p>That the calling of Bishops &amp;c. is vnlawfull.</p>
               <p>That as they deale in causes ecclesiasticall, there is no duety be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
vnto them, nor any, publikely to be giuen them.</p>
               <p>That it is not lawful, to be ordained by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into the ministery; or
to denounce either suspensions or excommunications sent from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:774:48"/>
That it is not lawfull, to rest in the Bishops depriuation of any
from the ministerie, except (vpon consultation with the neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministers
adioyning, and his flocke) it seeme so good vnto them:
but that he continue in the same, vntill he be compelled to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
by ciuill force.</p>
               <p>That it is not lawfull, to appeare in a Bishops Court: but with
protestation of their vnlawfulnes.</p>
               <p>That Bishops are not to be acknowledged, either for <hi>Doctors,
Elders,</hi> or <hi>Deacons,</hi> as hauing no ordinary calling.</p>
               <p>That touching the restauration of their Ecclesiasticall disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
it ought to be taught to the people, <hi>data occasione,</hi> as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

               <p>That <hi>nondum</hi> (as yet) the people are not to be solicited, <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licè</hi>
(publickly) to the practise of the discipline: <hi>donec,</hi> (till) they
be better instructed in the knowledge of it.</p>
               <p>That men of better vnderstanding, are to be allured priuatly,
to the present imbracing of the Discipline and practise of it, as far
as they shall be well able, with the peace of the Church. And thus
<hi>farre the</hi> prouinciall Synode <hi>of the</hi> Warwickeshire Classis.</p>
               <p>Likewise at that time, there was in the same assembly, a
great approbation obtained of the foresaid booke of <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,</hi>
as to be a <hi>draught of Discipline, essentiall &amp; necessarie for

and for the maner of the vse of that booke,) were then
brought forth, treated-of, and subscribed vnto, (as Maister

by the said parties depositions, that diuers others did sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
at the same time, (or at the least within a short time

               </p>
               <p>This booke, hauing thus at the last receaued this great
allowance, more authentically: was carried farre and nere,
for a generall ratification of all the brethren. It was offered

<hi>Maister Litleton</hi> affirmeth. But that, which <hi>Maister Iohnson</hi>
hath set downe,<note place="margin">Iohnson be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners.</note> is worthy the remembrance. The effect of
it, is this: <hi>that when the booke of Discipline came to Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
to be subscribed vnto: there was a generall censuring vsed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the brethren there, as it were to sanctifie themselues, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by sustaining a kinde of penance, and reproofe for their former
conformity, to the orders of the Church, established by her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
and other matters of conuersation: and partly to prepare their
mindes for the deuout accepting of the foresaid booke.</hi> In which
course of censuring vsed at that time, there was such rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
vp, one of anothers life, euen from their youth, as that
they came vnto great bitternes, with many <hi>reuiling tearms</hi>
amongst themselues, one growing thereby odious to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

agree amongst themselues, that so many as would should sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe

               <p>I finde mention also of another Synode, 1589. held (as

It is also fit to be vnderstood, who they are, that most
commonly met there also, at their more <hi>generall, prouinciall</hi>
or <hi>nationall</hi> assemblies or Synodes. And this both <hi>maister
Barber,</hi> and <hi>maister Stone,</hi> doo sufficiently declare. <hi>For the

since the last Parliament,</hi> (saith maister Stone,) <hi>there haue bin
seuerall meetings in</hi> London <hi>at the houses of maister Gardiner,
maister Egerton, maister Trauers, and maister Barber. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
that vsually mette in these assemblies,</hi> (saith maister Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,)

               </p>
               <p>Maister Cartwright, maister Trauers, and maister Egerton,
were at sundry times chosen <hi>Moderators</hi> or <hi>Presidents</hi> in the
said assemblies. <hi>And afterwardes generally of the office of
the</hi> Moderators. The resolutions, conclusions, and determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of such matters, as were disputed-of, and agreed-vpon, by the
more number of them, that so disputed in the said assemblies: were
by the saide <hi>Moderators or Presidents,</hi> before named, at the
times and places of the saide seuerall assemblies, summarily and
briefly, either written in a booke, or otherwise set-downe in loose
papers, as to the saide <hi>Moderators, or Presidentes</hi> should bee
thought meet or conuenient.</p>
               <p>As the <hi>Classicall</hi> assemblies of <hi>London</hi> were of greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimation,
then those in the Country: so these more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
meetings or Synodes last mentioned, were of highest
authoritie: and indeed the <hi>grand test</hi> of all the rest. It may
be said truely of them both, that they haue been the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
sparkes of all those flames, which are in the Church.
What was there ordered, went, as perfectly currant. From
thence, the brethren, of other places, did fetch their light.
As doubts did arise, thither they were sent to be resolued.
The <hi>Classicall</hi> and <hi>Synodicall decrees</hi> in other places, were
neuer authenticall indeede, (as it seemeth,) till there they
were ratified. The chiefest directions, for all the brethren
else-where, were sent from thence. It is wonderfull to
consider, how men so obstinate and wilfull in their owne
waies against the Church of <hi>England,</hi> established by her
Maiestie; should be brought to submit themselues in such
sort, as they did, to be led by these assemblies, as elswhere
it doth appeare.</p>

before: and writ to his friends, what was the summe of
them: to the intent they might <hi>be forewarned,</hi> and so (as

owne authority, without any further staying (as they had
done) for the ciuill Magistrate, albeit they pretende now
the contrary: then it is fit that I produce some further
matter to this purpose.</p>
               <p>Amongst sundry things in the said booke of <hi>Discipline,</hi>
let these few be well considered of, &amp; weighed. It is there
sayd: <hi>Presbyterium in singulis ecclesiis constituendum est, there
ought to be erected in euery Church a Presbyterie.</hi> Now if they
had meant, (as it is pretended) not to haue put their book,
or at the least some chiefe parts thereof in practise, vntill it
should haue beene established by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> they
would haue sayde for <hi>constituendum est,</hi> there ought to bee
erected, <hi>constituatur,</hi> let there bee erected in euery parish a
Presbyterie.</p>
               <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Cap. de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent. ecclesiae.</note> in all their assemblies prescribed in the booke,
this was one point to be still inquired of: <hi>vtrum disciplina
vigeat, whether the Discipline had any life in it, or were estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
or continued:</hi> which question had beene friuolous, and
very vnmeete to haue beene continued, as prescribed by
Law, if the Discipline it selfe had beene allowed by <hi>Act</hi> of

               <p>
                  <hi>Furthermore saith the booke:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cap. de conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onibus ad ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiam ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendis.</note> in funeribus desuescendum

               <p>Likewise, <hi>festi dies sunt commodè abolendi: holy daies</hi> (as

for the reasons alledged: <hi>from henceforth let there be, or it is

(as the vse of the Church is,) in blessing of mariages. The forme
whereof, is most fit and commodious, that is vsed by those Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
which haue erected the <hi>discipline,</hi> according to the worde
of God.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Parliament</hi> (27. of her Maiestie: as I remember)
the brethren hauing made another booke, tearmed at that
time: <hi>A booke of the forme of common prayers, &amp;c.</hi> and contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in it the effect of their whole pretended discipline:
the same booke was penned, altogether statute and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
and their petition in the behalfe of it was: vz. <hi>May it
therefore please your maiesty, &amp;c. that it may be enacted, &amp;c. that
the booke hereunto annexed, &amp;c. intituled: a booke of the forme
of common prayers, administration of Sacraments, &amp;c. and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing therein contained, may be from henceforth authorized,
put in vre, &amp; practised throughout all your maiesties dominions.</hi>
See here, when they hoped to haue attained their purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
by law, and to haue had the same accordingly establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed:
they offered to the <hi>Parliament</hi> a booke of their own,
for the <hi>forme</hi> of <hi>common praiers,</hi> &amp;c. and thought it (as it
seemeth) altogether inconuenient, to leaue euery minister
to his owne choyse, to vse what forme hee list, other then
such as were allowed in some Church, which had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the Discipline: for any such they liked-of indefinitly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:774:53"/>
Whereby it to me it seemeth manifest, that they neuer
meant, to haue required the enacting of that Chapter, <hi>de
reliquis liturgiae officijs,</hi> but onely to set downe, what course
their bretheren should follow for the <hi>interim,</hi> vntill they
might take further order for a booke of their owne.</p>
               <p>Lastly, in all this whole booke of <hi>Discipline,</hi> there is not
once mention made of any authority, or office, in or ouer
the Church; belonging to the Christian <hi>ciuill</hi> Magistrate.
Hee hath not so much, as either voyce or place, in any of
their <hi>Synodes,</hi> as a member thereof: except he be chosen to
be an <hi>Elder.</hi> He hath not any power assigned vnto him to
call a <hi>Synode:</hi> no, though it bee a <hi>Nationall Synode:</hi> nor so
much as to appoint the particular times or places of their
meetinges, nor (which is most strange,) so much as that
his assent, is to be required to any of their Canons. But all
these thinges are set downe in this booke, as of right to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine
vnto their Ministers and Elders. For the tryall
whereof: I must needes referre you to the booke it selfe,
which is in many mens handes: where you shall finde the
brethren ascribe that to themselues, which in the greatest
darkenes of Popery, all the BB<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. in the Land (for ought I
doo remember) durst neuer challenge. Which is a proofe
sufficient, that either they meant by cunning to haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued
her Maiesty, by her owne consent, of all her <hi>regall</hi>
authority, in these and such like causes of the Church, as
not of right belonging vnto her (which they will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge:)
or otherwise, that they had agreed without
her consent, to take this authority vnto themselues: which
(if they had any conscience) they would not stick to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse:
that being assuredly their currant doctrine, as in
some other place it shall hereafter more fully appeare.</p>
               <p>But it may be said that these are onely collections. Well
let them be, as they are. Indeede there is no cause, why I
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:774:54"/>

               <p>We affirme it to be the same, which wee desire to be established

shall offer oportunity, and giue vs to discerne it so expedient) by

               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:774:54"/>
We promise to guide our selues, and to be guided by it, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to it.</p>
               <p>For more especiall declaration of some points more important
and necessarie, we promise vniformely, to follow such order, when
we preach the word of God, as in the booke by vs is set downe, in
the <hi>Chapters</hi> of the office of Ministers of the word, of preaching
or sermons, of Sacraments, of Baptisme, and of the Lords supper.</p>
               <p>Further also, wee promise to followe the order set downe in the
<hi>Chapters</hi> of the meetings, as farre as it concerneth the Ministers
of the worde. For which purpose, we promise to meete euery sixe
weekes together, in <hi>Classicall</hi> conferences, with such of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
here assembled, as for their neighbourhood may fit vs best:
and such other, as by their aduise we shall be desired to ioyne with

               <p>The like wee promise, for <hi>Prouinciall</hi> meetinges euery halfe
yeare from our conferences, to sende vnto them, as is set downe in

               <p>Likewise also, that we will attend the <hi>generall assembly</hi> eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
yeare, and at all <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and as often as by order it shall
be thought good, to be assembled. <hi>Hitherto the Articles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now by these articles, and by their subscription vnto
them, it is most euident, that the pretences made by some,
are but meerly shiftes: as that their purpose onely was, to
haue the booke in readines against a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and that
they subscribed the articles to no other ende, but onely to
testifie their agreement in iudgement, for that they were
charged to disagree amongst themselues. For if that had
beene their intent, it had beene sufficiently performed, by
subscribing to the first article onely. But they proceede-on
further: and entred into a certaine <hi>league,</hi> or <hi>association,</hi> bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
themselues by promise; vnder their hands, what they
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:774:55"/>
(for their owne partes) will attempt, and as they might
perfourme.</p>
               <p>In the second article, (as it is apparant,) there are other
lawfull meanes promised to bee vndertaken, (for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancing
of the <hi>Discipline,</hi>) then <hi>prayers</hi> to God, and <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications</hi>
to her Maiesty and the Parliament.<note place="margin">Litleton.</note> Whereupon
<hi>Maister Litleton</hi> (a subscriber) being examined, what hee
vnderstoode <hi>those meanes to bee:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Before the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> answereth vpon his oath,
<hi>that he thinketh their priuate conferences, were meant, to be those
lawfull meanes mentioned in the article.</hi> Which is according
to the resolution of the brethren in of <hi>London,</hi> set downe
before, out of <hi>Maister Edmondes</hi> examination: vz. <hi>that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they could not preuaile,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Before the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> 
                  <hi>by sute to the State: the Ministers
themselues should set vp the</hi> Discipline, <hi>as they should bee able.</hi>
And <hi>Maister Iohnson,</hi> is also as direct vppon his oath, to the
same effect, saying.</p>
               <p>It was a generall conclusion amongst all the <hi>Classes,</hi> and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
that forasmuch, as the <hi>Discipline</hi> required by petitions,
could not bee publikely established by lawe, it was thought in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
necessary, to establish it and practise it priuately: to which
purpose also, euery man was to vse his endeuour, to encrease the
number of such, as would conforme themselues that way.</p>
               <p>Againe it is promised in the same <hi>Article,</hi> that they
would proceede with their sayd meanes, for the aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their <hi>Discipline, so far as the peace of the present state
of our Church would suffer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now how farre that is, it hath beene before touched in
the <hi>decrees</hi> of one of their <hi>Synodes,</hi> 1583. for as men most
strangely bewitched) they imagined, that they could so
cunningly play their feates, as that they (might in effect)
set vp their owne <hi>Discipline,</hi> secretely, vnder hand, and yet
neuer disturbe the present gouernement of the Church.</p>
               <p>For as peace is heere taken in their sense, one King or
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:774:55"/>
gouernement may inuade another, with all kinde of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stility,
and say (as they doo) that they meane but peace.
The truth is, they may haue peace in their mouths, but in
their actions, there is nothing lesse. So as this their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
(being but a vaine pretence) doth no way indeed
impaeach my assertion.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, whereas also it followeth in the same ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
<hi>(and not enforce to the contrarie,)</hi> Maister <hi>Littleton</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
examined vpon his oath <hi>what that should meane:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In the Starre Chamber.</note> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
that he <hi>himselfe, Maister Snape, Maister Proudloe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
did agree, to put the said articles and</hi> Discipline <hi>in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and practise, so far as the peace and the present estate of the
Church will suffer, and not enforce to the contrarie. That is to say:
till the Magistrate did enioyne them or enforce them, to leaue the
practise of the said</hi> Discipline: and in another place, <hi>till the
Magistrate did inhibite them to the contrarie, and force them to
leaue it.</hi> And further, hee also sayth: <hi>that they did agree to
guide themselues by the said booke of Discipline, and according to
it, with the same limitation.</hi> Now what if by their secret pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises,
(to drawe away the peoples harts from the present
gouernement of the Church) they could haue procured
such strength and number, to haue followed them, as that
no reasonable restraint, or force of the Magistrate had bin
able to haue encountred and suppressed them? I doo but
aske the question.</p>
               <p>In the rest of the <hi>Articles,</hi> there are but two generall
points: the one contained in the third <hi>Article,</hi> concerning
the vniformitie, which they promise to vse in their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery:
and the other is, as touching their agreement, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the orders set downe for their meetinges: <hi>Classicall,</hi>
contained in the fourth: <hi>Prouinciall</hi> in the fift: <hi>Nationall</hi>
in the sixt article.</p>
               <p>So as where before in the second <hi>Article,</hi> they had men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:774:56"/>
                  <hi>other meanes,</hi> whereby they had promised to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance
their <hi>Discipline,</hi> besides <hi>praiers to God,</hi> and <hi>supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to her Maiestie:</hi> they doo nowe in part explane them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
in the other <hi>Article</hi> following, and doo set downe,
what <hi>meanes</hi> they that were Ministers would vse and put
in practise, for the aduauncement of it, vz. the two points
mentioned, that is, their <hi>vniformity in preachings,</hi> and their
<hi>meetinges:</hi> according to Master <hi>Littletons</hi> deposition: in
these words: <hi>they meant by those meanes, in the second Article,
their conferences, as he thinketh.</hi> But to carry this matter past
thinking:<note place="margin">In the Starre Chamber.</note> let Master <hi>Fen</hi> be heard: who saith: <hi>that he agreed
to put some things of the booke in execution, according to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription:</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow because it appeareth, in the thirde, fourth,

abuse a good worde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) in the perfourming of their promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
touching the said particulars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Maister <hi>Littleton</hi> beeing
sworne,<note place="margin">Exami. before the Commi.</note> dealeth (as it seemeth) very directly to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
for (as he saith) concerning the contents of the foure
last <hi>Articles, hee for his part, whilest hee was of that company,
perfourmed his promise, and (he thinketh) that the rest that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
did the like.</hi> But to the particulars: and first of the
first point.</p>
               <p>The Minister, that is to preach, shall appoint the Psalme that
is to be song,<note place="margin">De officio. Minist. &amp;c</note> &amp;c. After the Psalme, let there be made a short ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
to the congregation: howe they shall prepare themselues
rightly, to pray. Let a Prayer followe, containing the confession of
sinnes, &amp;c. and concluded with the Lords Prayer. After the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
let Prayers be made for grace, that the auditors may profite
by the doctrine deliuered: also for the whole Church, and all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
callinges: and let them end likewise with the Lords Prayer.
Then a Psalme, &amp;c. and lastly let the conclusion bee made, with
some short forme of blessing the congregation, taken out of the
Scriptures.</p>
               <p>For the practise of this order: I referre the proofe of it
to all those, who haue obserued the manner of any of the
brethrens behauiour, in their seuerall Churches. The most
of them, that are but Doctors, (as they terme themselues)
and readers of Lectures in other mens charges, do seldom
or neuer come to the seruice, which is read in the Church
according to her Maiesties Lawes: but vnder pretence of
studying for their sermons, doo absent themselues, vntill
seruice bee done, or at the least almost finished, and then
they come in, (grauely I warrant you,) and doo goe to
this their owne forme of seruice.</p>
               <p>The rest of the fraternity, that haue cures of their own,
some of them will haue a <hi>Parliament Minister,</hi> (as they
terme him) vnder them, to say seruice: and then he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:774:57"/>
dealeth, as it hath beene noted of the Doctor: but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that are not able to haue such a one, they for their <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
standing</hi> (as their tearme is) doo vse some piece of our
seruice-booke, and peraduenture reade a lesson, (which
things they affirme, as it hath beene touched, may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
as wel by those, that are not ministers, as by them.)
And then they in like sort, doo begin their owne ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
function, and proceede according to the foresaide fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion,
subscribed-vnto, and promised.</p>
               <p>But to proceede vnto their practise of other pointes of
that booke.</p>
               <p>The Preachers must leaue off,<note place="margin">Deioncioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus habendis, &amp;c.</note> by little and little, as they may
conueniently, to preach at burials, least thereby they nourish the
superstition of some men, or giue ouer themselues to the preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of vanity.</p>
               <p>Let not women onely offer infants to Baptisme, but the father,
if it may be conueniently,<note place="margin">De Baptismo.</note> or els some others in his name.</p>
               <p>Let perswasions be vsed, that such names, as doo sauour either
of Paganisme or Popery, bee not giuen to children at their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
but principally those, whereof there are examples in the
Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Whether these pointes, (especially for two of them)
haue beene practised by the brethren or not, the <hi>newe
Churchyard</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and many brables in the country, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
vrging of the natural fathers to become Godfathers
to their owne children, &amp;c, can more then sufficiently

his oath, deliuer an especiall history (to this purpose)
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:774:57"/>
of giuing names.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Snape</hi> would not Baptise one <hi>Christopher Hodgkinsons</hi>
childe, because hee would haue the childe called <hi>Richard.</hi> The
order was this. <hi>Hodgkinson</hi> obtained promise of <hi>Snape:</hi> that
he would christen his childe. But (saith <hi>Snape</hi>) you must then
giue it a Christian name, allowed in the Scriptures. The partie
told him, that his wiues father, whose name was <hi>Richard,</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the name. Well (saith <hi>Snape</hi>) you must doe as I bidde you:
that, when you come, the congregation be not troubled. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
the said <hi>Hodgkinson</hi> not thinking it would haue
beene made a matter of such importance, the child was brought.
<hi>Snape</hi> proceeded in the action, till hee came to the naming of the
child. And when he heard, that they called the child <hi>Richard,</hi> &amp;
that they would giue him no other name; hee staied there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
would not in any wise Baptize the child. And so the child was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away thence, &amp; was Baptized the weeke following, at <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallowes</hi>
being named <hi>Richard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of likelyhoode, the brethren haue founde this thing to
be a matter of great importance: that they wil rather leaue
an infant vnbaptized, then giue him such a name.</p>

first let the Acts of the next assemblie afore, (that was of the same

then vndone, it may be dispatched. Then, let those matters be

               <p>It shall be lawful for other Elders &amp; Ministers, yea &amp; for Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons

In making choise of a place for the Assemblies, respect is to

               <p>It is expedient, that in euerie Ecclesiasticall Assembly, there

from time to time chaunged, if it may be conueniently: &amp; he must
be thus chosen, viz.</p>

them: that the absents may be called-vpon at the next assembly, to
yeeld a reason of their absence.</p>
               <p>Which if it be not sufficient, let them be censured, by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of the Assemblie. Then let him read the Actes of the last As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
that if any thing thereof remaine, it may then bee dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.
Then shall be aske of euerie one, in order as they sit, their let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

Which being propounded in the same order, and sufficiently deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

the suffrages, and pronounce what the greater part adiudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
Which be shall procure to be put into Actes, that the Delegates
of the seuerall Churches, may procure copies and transcripts to bee

appertaineth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>President</hi> also, by the iudgement and authority of the
Assembly, is to giue answere, either by word of mouth, or by letters,
to such as require it. If any censures be to be inflicted, hee is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
them. He shall also take care, that all things be godly and
quietly carried, by exhorting them vnto quietnes, and moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

preferring vp, such as be wilfull and contentious, vnto the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly:
lastly, he shall propound vnto them, touching the time of their

to goe forward in their duety, and with thanksgiuing, he shall cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously
dismisse them.</p>
               <p>Before the dismission of the Assembly, let no man depart, but
with leaue.</p>
               <p>The assemblies according to their seuerall kindes, if they bee

done it, when their fellowes haue beene most busie, to
trouble the present estate of the Church. Besides that,
these fasts with their seueral sermons and other prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:774:61"/>
haue had another principal vse: vz. (as <hi>Lord</hi> did write
to <hi>Fen</hi> of maister <hi>Cartwrights</hi> pleasure) <hi>that the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the brethren might talke of other matters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewise (<hi>saith maister</hi> Iohnson) <hi>touching the election
and making of ministers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohnson be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missioners.</note> I thinke they obserue, asmuch as they
can, the order prescribed in the said booke of Discipline. As about
<hi>Proudloe,</hi> of <hi>Weedenbeck</hi> his admission, (<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> I haue heard)
and <hi>Snapes</hi> and <hi>Larkes.</hi> The manner whereof is, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the calling, they haue had of the Bishops, and doe take it
againe, from the approbation of the <hi>Classis. And againe:</hi> they
will be content to accept orders from the Bishop, as a ciuill matter,
but doe not thereby account themselues Ministers, vntill the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
brethren of some <hi>Classes</hi> haue allowed them. <hi>But more fully</hi>
Richard Hawgar.<note place="margin">Rich. Hawgar his depositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> The first degree they haue entered into, is this:
that teaching all Ministers, which are called according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Church of England, to bee vnlawfull: they doe vrge,
such as they dare trust, and who are Ministers alreadie) to seeke
at their <hi>Classis</hi> a new approbation, which they terme the <hi>Lords
ordinance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this action, the Minister before allowed of, must renounce
his former calling, and take that calling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (wherby he must stand)
of them.</p>
               <p>The manner whereof, is this: when any doe yeeld hereunto,
they appoint a day of their <hi>Classis,</hi> &amp;c. As the example follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wil shew. One master <hi>Hocknel,</hi> being to haue a benefice, was
willed (by his Patrone) to bring some testimoniall, of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the shyre for his good conuersation. Wherevpon hee came
to Maister Snape. Who dealt with him (as is afore mentioned,)
and <hi>Hocknell</hi> hauing beene a Minister before, (some sixe or
seauen yeares) yeelding: <hi>Snape,</hi> with his companions gaue him
a text, and appointed him a day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:774:62"/>
At which time the <hi>Classis</hi> met in Saint <hi>Peters:</hi> and hee
preached. After, they assembled themselues, willing <hi>Hocknell</hi>
to stand aloofe. Then Maister <hi>Penry</hi> beganne to make a speech,
exhorting them to be carefull, to call vpon God: to deale without
affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this their action &amp;c. After which, they fel to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Some liked, that the man shuld be admitted, &amp; some other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
Those that were against him made these two reasons. First,
that hee had not iumped meete, in deliuering the Metaphore,
which was in his text: secondly because he was neyther Grecian
nor Hebrician. So as they ouerruling the rest, <hi>Hocknell</hi> was
called for, and in some sort commended: but yet the speaker
of the <hi>Classis</hi> told him, he must take more paines at his book, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could allow of him, as a fit Minister. Hereupon Master
<hi>Hocknell</hi> and they fell out: and he (contemning their censure)
did proceede, and tooke possession of his benefice.</p>
               <p>When they call a man, that is not alreadie a Minister: then
hauing vsed the order before mentioned, they command him to
goe to the Bishops, as to a ciuile Magistrate, for his writinges,
(<hi>which they tearme by a prettie name that this ex. hath
forgotten:</hi> and this they say, is onely for his safe standing in his
former calling, receiued of them: not that thereby hee receaueth
any power to be a Minister. On this sort was Master <hi>Lark</hi> (dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
a little from <hi>Wellingborow</hi>) called.</p>
               <p>After this calling by them, the parties so called, may preache
here and there, as he thinketh good, vntill hee bee called to a
charge: &amp; then he must go to the Bishop, for his better standing,
and so the people calling him, he is a full Minister.</p>
               <p>Maister <hi>Snape</hi> being a Minister already, renounced that his
first calling: was called by the <hi>Classis:</hi> by that calling hee prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
but would not administer the Lords Supper. After the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> knowing, that he must not account himselfe
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:774:62"/>
a full Minister, vntill some particular congregation, had chosen
him, they chose him for their Minister, and so he standeth at this
present. <hi>Thus farre</hi> Hawger.</p>
               <p>It is likewise deposed by two,<note place="margin">Rich. Holmes. Rich. Hawgar before the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missioners.</note> that Maister <hi>Snape</hi> for the
answering of a question propounded vnto him, said, that
<hi>rather then he would haue stood, by vertue of any Letters of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
he would haue bin hanged vpon the gallowes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But let Maister</hi> Snape <hi>speake himselfe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Snape in a writing of his owne hand.</note> Touching the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of my calling to the ministerie: I affirme, that I had it of
the church of God, being approued by the learned &amp; godly neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Ministers, and chosen by the people of my charge, to that
function. Touching that allowance, that I had of the Bishop, I
take it to be a thing meerely ciuile, belonging to a ciuile Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate:
which authoritie he hath by Act of Parliament, &amp; which
therefore I might lawfully receaue at his hands, for the peaceable
execution of my Ministery.</p>
               <p>Againe, concerning the <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> (which the booke
affirmeth should be in euery parish:) they (want in effect)
nothing of all their whole platforme: if they could but
once attaine vnto the publike erecting vp of those <hi>thrones.</hi>
And how far it is likely they haue already preuailed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
without staying any longer for her Maiestie; let these
thinges following, whereof some haue beene touched al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie,
make it knowne vnto you. Mention hath beene
made of a <hi>Presbytery</hi> set vp at <hi>Wandesworth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ma. Edmonds</note> It was a decree
of the London brethren, <hi>that the Ministers should by little &amp;
little, as much as possibly they might, draw the Discipline into
practise, though they concealed the names, eyther of Presbytery,
Elder or Deaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, making little account of the names for the time,
so their offices might secretly be established.</hi> There was an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
sette downe, in an assembly (1583. as I take it) <hi>for
the conuerting of Churchwardens and Collectors into El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:774:63"/>
and Deacons:</hi> as before in the Actes themselues it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth.
According to this order the brethren afterward
sent their directions abroad, to their fellowes, for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of it.<note place="margin">Barbon to Field.</note> I receiued (<hi>saith Master</hi> Barbon) from our faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
brother Maister <hi>Gelibrande,</hi> a direction of the brethren,
concerning the Conuerting of Churchwardens into Elders, and
Collectors into Deacons.<note place="margin">Holmes.</note> 
                  <hi>Richard Holmes affirmeth that</hi> by
such speeches as he hath heard, hee doth verily thinke, that the
Ministers in their <hi>Classes</hi> haue resolued, to erect vp their seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Presbyteryes, in their owne parishes. <hi>With him agreeth
Master</hi> Iohnson:<note place="margin">Iohnson,</note> according to the rules of that booke, I thinke
that sercetly in most places, where the brethren of the <hi>Classes</hi>
are, there are Elders chosen, and that they put the Discipline in
practise, so farre as they may, amongst themselues, without any
apparant shew thereof, to the ouerthrow of their <hi>safe-standing.
Further also he deposeth, that</hi> he himselfe hath beene blamed
diuers times, priuatelie, in that he would make no such choise of
Elders, (where he preached,) to practise the Discipline. <hi>And
what els should</hi> Gellibrand <hi>meane, by these words in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to</hi> Field? I haue written to Maister Cartwright seuerally,
and ioyntly to him and the Elders, signifying my readines, and
what aduersaries there are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly there was a nomination of Elders, at</hi> Kilsby <hi>in</hi>
Northampton-shiere, <hi>made by Maister</hi> Lee <hi>the Pastor, in the
yeare 1588. Their names as it was deposed before Sir</hi>
George Farmer <hi>and Sir</hi> Iohn Spencer, <hi>were,</hi> William Greene,
Roger Cowley,<note place="margin">Ioh. Browne.</note> Thomas Hall, Richard Wolfe, Iohn Browne, <hi>and</hi>
William Mariat: which sixe (saith the deponent,) Maister <hi>Lee</hi>
thought sufficient to determine and end all matters of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
in the said towne. <hi>Henry Pinson</hi> also affirmeth, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enformed of this election of Elders, by the said <hi>Browne</hi> and
others would not yeelde his consent thereunto, but said hee would
stand to the lawes of this realme, appointed by her Maiestie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:774:63"/>
One especiall reason, (as it was enformed) why <hi>Pinson</hi>
refused in this sort to ioyne with his neighbours, was: for
that there should haue beene some punishment, inflicted
by the said Elders vppon his sonne, for flinging a stone at
<hi>Elder-Mariats</hi> window, which he would none of, but was
faine to flie to her Maiesties lawes.</p>
               <p>So here then it appeareth (in some sort,) whether the
brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meant, to stay any more for the ciuile Magistrate,
in erecting of their <hi>Presbyteries:</hi> then they confesse they
did, concerning their <hi>vniformitie</hi> in Sermons and tripar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
<hi>meetings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides, it doth also appertaine to the further proofe of
the said <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> that (as it seemeth) some of those cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
haue beene vsed: for example, <hi>excommunication:</hi>
Which (by the rules of the Discipline booke) are of right
to be exercised by them. One <hi>Bluet</hi> a Minister (as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose)
being exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated (as it seemeth) did write a
Letter to <hi>Field</hi> and <hi>Egerton:</hi> wherein hee is most earnest,
that vpon his repentaunce hee might bee restored againe
to the Church. <hi>Woe is me</hi> (saith he) <hi>that I am cast out of your
presence this day: but shame and sorrow is vnto the cause. And
if this woe and shame did but touch the bodie, it were tollerable:
for then at the day of death I should end my miserie, and no more
heare the words of reproach. For now euery one that seeth mee,
reprooueth me: and I am become a rebuke vnto all men. But this
is not all. Woe is me, that there is a partition-wall, betweene hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and my conscience, &amp;c. If my offence may not bee passed by,
without further confession: euen before God and his Church in</hi>
London, <hi>will I lie downe and licke the dust at your feet, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
more against my selfe then any of you know.</hi> Seuere <hi>Catoes,</hi>
I warrant you. But is this the matter they contend for,
that men may fall downe, and kisse their feete?</p>
               <p>There is also another example to this effect, worthie of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:774:64"/>
your remembrance: one <hi>La. Thomson</hi> writeth in this sort
of it. <hi>I thinke of him as an vnsound member, vnfit to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in the bodie, vnles he would be subiect to the gouernment
of a bodie, especially the bodie of our sauing God.</hi> The partie
meant by <hi>Thomson,</hi> was (as I take it) maister <hi>Wilcox,</hi> the
author of that <hi>admonition,</hi> which caused the first breaking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
of all those troubles, that since haue ensued. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by foure letters, written about the yeare 1583.
three of them from <hi>Field</hi> to <hi>Wilcox,</hi> and one from <hi>Wilcox</hi>
to <hi>Field.</hi> What the cause was, though it bee expressed in
one of the said Letters, I omit to rehearse it, no waies min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to touch any mans priuate behauiour or infirmities.
But this I must tel you, that the brethren, (that is in <hi>Thom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
sense, <hi>the body of our sauing God,</hi>) were so displeased and
angrie with him, that they suspended him from his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie,
and did vse their censure of <hi>excommunication</hi> against
him.</p>
               <p>If you aske mee how <hi>Wilcox</hi> tooke this course at their
handes, I answere, euen as <hi>Pinson</hi> before named did, when
his sonne should haue beene punished: hee disliked it so
much, as that hee began to call their authoritie (for such
kind of their proceedings,) in question, he refused to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
himselfe to their censures, and told <hi>Field</hi> plainely, <hi>that
he had bin dealt disorderly withall, both for matter and manner:</hi>
adding <hi>that hee had perhaps concealed as great infirmities of</hi>
Fields, <hi>and of some others, as his were.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With these and many such like words</hi> Field <hi>was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prouoked, and for his owne part defied him.</hi> Whereas
<hi>(saith hee)</hi> for the hiding of your owne shame, you beginne to
score vp my faults, which you say are sixe in number, as great as
yours, if you should vtter them: I say it is no help to you, but te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth
that old pride, hipocrisie and malice, which long time hath
lurked in that cankered heart of yours, &amp;c. But I doe defie you,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:774:64"/>
&amp;c. <hi>And for his refusing of their proceedinges:</hi> you ought
not (<hi>saith</hi> Field) so lightly to esteeme, that holy censure of the
brethren, but in true repentance to haue hidden your face, &amp;c.
<hi>Againe:</hi> if God hath made you an instrument, to seeke for the
aduancement of Christs Scepter: kisse it your selfe and bee subiect
vnto it &amp;c. <hi>Againe,</hi> if you loue Christ and his Church, before
your owne glorie, and your owne sinnes haue shut vp your mouth:
then be silent for euer. <hi>And notwithstanding that</hi> Wilcox
<hi>tooke exception to their authoritie, yet in the Letter
wherein</hi> Field <hi>answereth that point, and many others, he
beginneth thus.</hi> The Lord Iesus open your eyes, and giue you
such a true sence, and feeling of your sins, that howsoeuer you for)
a time) be throwne to Sathan; in the end your soule may be saued,
and you may feele assurance of eternall life, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>What the issue of this matter was amongst them, I find
it not. It seemeth that in the end, <hi>Wilcoxe</hi> for lacke of his
former maintenance, (which was withheld from him by
the brethrens procurement, &amp; vpon perswasion that after
a time he should be restored to his ministerie againe, and
in the meane space be relieued) he was faine to yeeld and
to submit himselfe vnto their censure, (by them tearmed
<hi>the Scepter of Christ.</hi>) Marrie still he thought himselfe to be
hardly vsed, and after some time of expectation, desired (as
it seemeth) to know, how long hee should vndergoe their
heauie indignation. Whereunto <hi>Field</hi> answered thus.
<hi>The brethren thought meet to admonish you, vtterly to surcease.
For how long or how short, mee thinkes you should not enquire,
considering the circumstances: who know very well your selfe,
that if an otherwere in your case, that no time can bee limited.
Neuerthelesse, if you doubt the iudgement to bee too hard, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
is giuen, you may aske the priuate opinions of others your
best friends, as of Master</hi> Cartwright, <hi>and M.</hi> Thomson, <hi>who
are of mind that you are for euer disabled to that function, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>When Salutations are written,<note place="margin">Iohnson.</note> (<hi>saith</hi> maister Iohnson) by the

meaning is, (as I euer tooke it) to such as haue submitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
vnto the holy Discipline. <hi>Againe,</hi> when the name brother,
is giuen to ministers, it signifieth them to be of some <hi>Classis,</hi> for
their consulting and setting vp of Christes kingdome: and when
to the laitie, those that generally do ioyne with the ministers for

of some of the <hi>Classis,</hi> &amp;c. And these, both ministers and

much to the same purpose, both in the</hi> Starre-chamber, <hi>&amp;



before her Maiesties</hi> Commissioners for causes ecclesiasticall.
This <hi>(saith he)</hi> I do know, that when salutations were sent, or let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
written to <hi>London</hi> from some Ministers abroad, as from
<hi>Fen</hi> or <hi>Cartwright,</hi> &amp;c. to maister <hi>Field</hi> &amp; the rest, &amp;c. therby
was alwaies meant, properly, the ministers or the brotherhood of

of godly brethren, or sisters, or godly brotherhood or sisterhood,
they meane generally both all the said Ministers, and likewise
as many, as do depend vpon them for the cause of reformation. So
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:774:66"/>
as the rest of the Ministers and people, who and wheresoeuer, that

the Church with you: Our Churches<note n="b" place="margin">Knewstub to Field.</note> are in danger of such, as
hauing beene of vs, do renounce all fellowship with vs.</p>
               <p>The<note n="c" place="margin">Knewstub to Field.</note> hand of God is like to be heauy vpon our Churches here,
if the malice of Sathan and his instruments be not preuented. A
woman with vs, &amp;c. sometimes thought to be a friend to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
&amp;c: giueth it forth, that Maister <hi>Walsh</hi> had laid witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft
vpon her. She would haue had him conuented, by some of the
Iustices: but when he was once named she was repelled. Now she
is come to <hi>London</hi> &amp;c: She deuiseth newe matter against him,
and against vs all,<note place="margin">Good Iustice.</note> as that wee should haue had meetinges at her
house &amp;c. and that wee haue a priuate iurisdiction among our
selues, thinking that this will make her entrance vnto the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop,</hi>
or high <hi>Commissioners</hi> &amp;c. I pray you first conferre
with maister <hi>Walsh:</hi> and then deale, (as secretly as you may) to
medicine these mischiefes.</p>
               <p>It is long<note n="d" place="margin">Blake to Field.</note> since I heard from you, <hi>(saith one Blake)</hi> of the
state of the Church of <hi>London. Another,</hi> By M. <hi>West</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Gelibrand to Field.</note> &amp; M.
<hi>Browne,</hi> you shall vnderstand the state of the Churches, wherein
we are. <hi>A third:</hi> If my offence<note n="f" place="margin">Rob. Bluet to Field and Egerton.</note> may not be passed by, without a
further confession, euen before God and his Church, in <hi>London</hi>
will I lie downe, and licke the dust at your feete, and confesse &amp;c.
<hi>A fourth:</hi> I receiued a letter<note n="g" place="margin">Fenne to Field.</note> from you in the name of the rest
of the brethren: whereby I vnderstand your ioyning together, in
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:774:66"/>
choosing of my selfe, vnto the seruice of the Church, vnder the
<hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Leicester, &amp;c.</hi> I am ready to runne, if the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
me, according to the holy decrees and orders of the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.
<hi>By these their speeches it appeareth, that as they
haue cut off themselues from the fellowship of the rest of
the</hi> Christians <hi>in</hi> England, <hi>by ioyning themselues into a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
brotherhood: so haue they already seduced her
Maiesties subiects, by gathering them together into a new
societie, whereunto they doe appropriat the name of the
Church: as though all other Churches in the realme, were
but as</hi> Iewish Sinagogues <hi>or heathenish assemblies. This is
not, (you shall see) my bare collection: heare the witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
what they hereof haue deposed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In these brethrens speaches of the Church or Churches:<note place="margin">Iohnson.</note> it is to
be vnderstood, that by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> they meane the
Church according to humaine lawes and the Popes: which is ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
(as they terme it) by an Antichristian gouernement. And
by the <hi>Godly Churches,</hi> or the <hi>Churches of God</hi> in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
they meane such places, congregations, or assemblies, as doe
embrace the reformation, and haue such a minister, as is of some
Classis.</p>
               <p>Sometime also by the Church, (as the Church of God in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>)
is meant the <hi>Classis</hi> of the brethren, or their Synods. <hi>And
so maister</hi> Edmondes:<note place="margin">Edmondes.</note> when they vse these, or the like speaches,
in their writing or otherwise: vz. the Church or Churches of
God heere, with this or that, or the Church in <hi>London</hi> hath done
this or that: they by they especially meane the Ministers the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But for the further clearing of this matter: because the
chiefe</hi> Rabbies <hi>of this conspiracie, do themselues preach in
our material Churches, it is to be obserued, that the parish
where they preach, being assembled, is not the Church
properly in their sence: but as many thereof onely, as are
ioyned vnto them with that inuiolable bond mentioned:
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:774:67"/>
vz.</hi> the desire of the godly discipline: <hi>and those further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
who leauing their owne</hi> parish Churches, <hi>doe come
vnto them. As for example: The Church of God (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth)
in the</hi> Black Fryers, <hi>doth consist, besides that parish,
of a number of men and Marchauntes wiues, dispersed
here and there throughout the whole Citie. Be content to
hear the depositions, that are taken to like purpose.</hi> Maister
Snape<note place="margin">Snape.</note> affirmed (as Richard Holmes<note place="margin">Holmes.</note> 
                  <hi>and</hi> Richard Hawgar<note place="margin">Hawgar.</note> haue
deposed): that here one, &amp; there one, picked out of the Prophane
and common multitude, and put a-part to serue the Lord: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the Church of God, and not the generall multitude. Maister
Iohnson saith, that the brethren of the laitie doe seldome come to
their owne parish Churches, nor receiue the communion there, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
then they are compelled for feare of trouble. For they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
those their pastors onely, whom they do so choose. <hi>And mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
Edmonds,<note place="margin">Edmondes.</note> 
                  <hi>vpon his experience in</hi> London. The people of
this brotherhood, do seldome come to their owne parish Churches,
otherwise then for feare, to incurre some daunger of lawes: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do they accompt the minister of their parishes, to bee any of
their pastors properly: except he be some one of the <hi>brethren Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,</hi>
before specified, or very effectually inclining that way.</p>
               <p>It is likewise to bee obserued, that if any of this faction, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood,
or sisterhood, do lie dangerously sicke: they do seldome or
neuer, send for their owne pastors to visite them: nor moue them
to pray for them, publikely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in their owne parish as neglecting
their praiers: but do send to the Readers abroad, whom they haue
chosen for their pastors, both to come vnto them, &amp; to pray with
them, and for them, in their assemblies.</p>
               <p>This also is to bee obserued, that the stricter sort of this crue,
when they lie at the point of death, will haue no bell tolled for
them: and many of them do take order, before their death: that
afterwardes, they be not buried in any Church: that there bee no
sermon: nor any wanner of buriall vsed, which is prescribed.</p>

               </p>
               <p>When you shall reade these strange assertions, so farre
passing any ordinary bounds of common modestie: think
with your selues, that it is no maruaile, to see their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges
so full of authorities. For I do assure you, that euen
in the like sort, and with the same sinceritie &amp; faithfulnes,
doe they alledge for their platformes, both Scriptures,

               <p>Moreouer, what with the pretence of Gods law, of mans
law, and (I know not) of what law, they haue been suffered
to go so farre against all lawes: that now they haue taken
such heart, as that some of them are not affraid to affirme
(and that in print because the people might take notice of
it):
that there is no authoritie, which may lawfully sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse

                  <hi>No Magistrate (saith one

               </p>
               <p>And thus hither to you haue seen the proceedings of our
English reformers according to their ringleaders actions in
Scotland: they haue had their draughts of discipline: they
haue subscribed a particular book for England: they haue
put their former platformes, &amp; their said particular booke,
(for the most part of it) in practise, as neare as they could:
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:774:68"/>
they haue had their meetinges and <hi>Synodes,</hi> generally
throughout all the lande: they haue made decrees &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions,
not only to further their own conspiracy, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to ouerthrow the present gouernment of the <hi>Church:</hi>
they haue had in some places their <hi>Elders:</hi> they haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
themselues from the ecclesiastical gouernment in
this Realme, accounting the same, (in some respects,) to
be <hi>Antichristian,</hi> and so not to be obeyed, (&amp; in some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
to be a meere ciuile, and <hi>a parliament church-gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
and in that regard, onely after a sort, to bee yeelded
vnto, for their better &amp; <hi>safer standing,</hi> in their owne sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and consistorian waies. They haue, by their false glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
seduced many of her Maiesties subiectes: they haue
combined themselues together, into a strange brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.
They challenge to their vnlawfull and seditious
assemblies, the true and most proper name of <hi>the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They say their doings are according to law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They affirme (in effect) that no Magistrate may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ouerthrow that, which they haue builded: in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">The humble motion pa. 84.</note>
                  <hi>as now it is saide, that the</hi> Bishops, in seeking <hi>by the
authority which her Maiestie hath giuen and confirmed
vnto them, to maintaine (as they are bound) the present
church-gouernment and state, established by her highnes
lawes within this Realme, and to suppresse and reforme
their schismaticall &amp; seditious disorders, and such like, are
the disturbers of the peace of the church: that the Bishops
beginne the</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">The hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble motion pa. 84.</note> quarrel <hi>in disquieting of them, who</hi> in towne

together, for the profiting of the Church. That<note n="c" place="margin">Epistle to the discouerie of R B. &amp;c.</note> the Bishops are
the schismatickes, and not they: that the crime of schisme, which
the prelates woulde fasten vppon them, doth iustly cleaue to the
Bishops: and that<note n="d" place="margin">Register pa. 69</note> Bishops may be discharged by the Church.</p>
               <p>And they haue entred alreadie into this consideration,

                  <hi>how Archbishops, Bishops, Chauncellors, Deanes, Cannons,

                  <hi>Commissaries, Registers, Apparitors &amp;c. (All

               </p>
               <p>Whereby it appeareth, that (in their owne conceites)
they haue already attained their soueraintie. They and
their conuenticles (forsooth) are the true Church: and all
England besides is in a schisme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So as now it may be dayly expected, when these godly
brethren, for a full conclusion of their attempts, will take

the estate of</hi> Bishops,<note place="margin">Declaration B 2.</note> 
                  <hi>and to direct their commissioners; to

I was sent, together with this my frend <hi>(Tertullus,)</hi> who
came out of Fraunce into England: to goe and seeke the subuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of their great assemblies, and the rest of their iurisdiction:
wherein I preuailed a while, but now it is worse then euer it was.
And it came so to passe: because the whole land cried for Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
againe; and the Noble men so stifly did stand to it: and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Ministers that came home from England, dealt so boldly
with the king; that I was vtterly cast out, without all hope euer to
doe any good there againe, and now I make homeward in hast,
least I loose all there also.</p>
               <p>Here you haue the brethrens approbation of the afor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saide
attempt in <hi>Scotland:</hi> whereby it is apparaunt, that if
they shal be able to bring the people to such a kind of cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,
and the nobility to such a manner of stifnes: they can
be wel content for their partes, to haue her maiestie vsed,
as the <hi>Scottish king</hi> was: for it is according to their <hi>Geneua</hi>

               <p>

do relate to the <hi>Bishop</hi> those occurrents in <hi>Englande,</hi>
which had fallen out and hapned in his absence. And
vppon the occasion of this question, asked by the <hi>Bishop:</hi>
vz. <hi>haue not the Bishops yet suppressed the Puritans, neither
with countenance, nor by authority? Tertullus</hi> maketh this
aunswere. <hi>Suppressed? no, my Lord: a friend of mine writte
vnto me, that one of their preachers saide in the Pulpit; he was
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:774:71"/>
perswaded that there were a 100000. of them in England, and
that the number of them increased dayly in euery place, of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states

               </p>
               <p>Is it not time for the Magistrates to looke about
them? They do take it in scorne to bee thought so
weake, as that they could bee suppressed. Bee it, they
flatter themselues therein: yet their desire is apparant,
that (if they be suffered, and shall euer be able) they will
bring it to that passe. And if this be not a necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
of the premisses: my iudgement faileth me. But

<hi>Bishops:</hi> saying that <hi>no bloud can handsomly be spilt, vnlesse they
be the butchers.</hi> But he passeth cunningly by his own mind,
as very wel knowing his companions capacities. Indeed, if
they do take vpon them to spil bloud, they cannot (thanks
be to God) as yet, do it handsomely. The Lord of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite

do neuer serue them better, then hitherto they haue

bee drawne, I leaue it to be considered of, by those that

you of, that (vppon what grounds I know not) through

perswaded my self, that his spirite did giue me many straunge di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
wherein the Lord would vse me to doe seruice to his most

this <hi>Copinger</hi> and <hi>Arthington,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cop. to T. C.</note> held another fast by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
<hi>Whereupon</hi> (saith <hi>Copinger) I was againe stirred vp, to
such businesse of such importance, as in the eyes of flesh and bloud,
was likelie to bring much danger to my selfe, and vnlikely to bring
any good successe to the Church of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of these his instigations, or reuelations, hee writ <hi>to

                  <hi>and to some without:</hi> as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

doe keepe Christ Iesus from gouerning in his kingdome.</hi> And
then hee addeth. <hi>My selfe am acquainted with some, who, to
do seruice herein, would aduenture the losse of their liues, so that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:774:78"/>
they might haue warrant from the worde, for their so doing, and
haue approbation by the Church. And to this end they fancy to
themselues to haue receiued an extraordinary calling, wherein
they feare to be abused by Sathan.</hi> Then followeth his petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<hi>And therefore I, thogh most vnworthy, haue aduentured to write
vnto you, to beseech you in the bowels of Christ Iesus, to haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with such, as are most able to aduise you on our behalfe,
and to returne answere, how a man may examine himselfe in this
matter, and what be the extraordinarie thinges, which must bee
in him, that is so called: what course he is to take, to haue his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie
calling knowne: first to himselfe, and then to the
Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After hee had sent away this letter into <hi>Scotland</hi> hee
began to draw his doubts into some Methode: and did
propound them all in eight questions. The chiefe
summe whereof, it this, <hi>whether in these dayes, and in
this countrey, where there is but preaching heere and there,
where the Discipline is not established, but oppugned, by the
publike Magistrates, whether there bee place for any extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
calling, immediately from God, of workers and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to his Church &amp;c.</hi> These questions thus contriued
hee sent them to his olde acquaintance <hi>Wigginton:</hi> who
iustly according to <hi>Copingers</hi> humor, aunswered them all
affirmatiuely: as his aunswers are to be shewed, vnder his
owne hand, and as <hi>Copinger</hi> did also write vnto maister

               <p>Vpon <hi>Copingers</hi> receite of this aunswere, that there
was high time, for such extraordinary callings: <hi>presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ther was an other fast procured by Copinger,</hi> for a better co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

of such his manner of calling,<note place="margin">Cop. to <hi>T.</hi> C.</note> and to see, if any

fast was held vppon the Wednesday, in a Marchauntes house,

                  <hi>and Wigginton himselfe with three
or fower others was present at it.</hi> But before this fast was held,
<hi>meanes was vsed</hi> (saith <hi>Copinger) to haue some notice giuen to
some of the Preachers in Prison, of the day of their humiliation,
and of their desire to haue them commend vnto God in their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
the holy purposes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cop. to T. C.</note> 
                  <hi>which any fearing God, should in time at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt

They humbly beseech Almighty God, that if hee had appointed
to vse any of them, to doe any special seruice to him and his: and
that to that end would extraordinarily call them,<note place="margin">Cop to T. C.</note> that he would
seale vp his or their so calling by some special manner, and by his
holy spirite, and giue such extraordinarie graces and giftes, as
were fitte for so waightie an action.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How the rest of this company sped hereby, I finde it
not: but</hi> Copinger <hi>(as hee sayth)</hi> was called againe the same
night in a dreame.<note place="margin">Copin. exam.</note> 
                  <hi>The manner whereof, he thus descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</hi>
About the midde part of the night, I thought my selfe in
my sleepe, to be carried into Heauen, and there being wonderfullie
astonished with the Maiestie of God, and brightnes of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
I made a lowde and most strong noice &amp;c. since which time, I
find euery day more &amp; more comfort: and suppose, there is som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
in me &amp;c. to worke <hi>(he meaneth some strange reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As before it hath bene partly touched, <hi>Copinger</hi> did not
only craue the aduise of some ministers in these his great
actions, (as oft he tearmed them): but also of such of the
Laity, as he thought were most fitte to ioine with him, or
to aduise him: and I doubt not, but that he dealt as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with them, as he had done before with <hi>Dauison</hi> a <hi>Scotte</hi>
and others. This doth appeare in some sort, by a Letter
written vnto <hi>Copinger</hi> by <hi>Peter Went worth,</hi> the fiue and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:774:79"/>
twentith of Ianuarie 1590. in answere of one sent vnto
him before, from <hi>Copinger.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. W. to Cop. 25. lan, 1590.</note> It seemeth that <hi>Copinger</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
desired maister <hi>Wentworth</hi> to come vnto him to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
that they might conferre together, &amp;c. for answere
he excuseth himselfe in respect of his lamenes. &amp;c. and
<hi>of his debillitie and weakenes, to giue aduise in matters of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
wherein I perceiue</hi> (saith hee) <hi>you are labouring.</hi>
And further (saith hee,) <hi>I do assure my selfe, that the purpose
tendeth vnto the true seruice of God, and of her Maiestie. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you resort to the Lorde, to direct your labours both in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and manner. For an ill manner may marre a good mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

               </p>
               <p>Besides it appeareth by a Letter of <hi>Copingers</hi> to <hi>Thomas
Lancaster,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cop. to L. 29, Iau. 15. 19</note> the Icholemaister, dated the nine and twentith
of <hi>Ianuarie:</hi> that he had disclosed, (as it should seeme, all

to haue had <hi>some conference with them:</hi> and offering
himselfe to be <hi>directed either to proceede, or draw backe, as the
Church should aduise.</hi> But they supposing the <hi>matter to bee
too harde to bee effected: and him an vnfitte man to manage it,</hi>
refused to admitte of any such conference. In the same let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it is also euident, that <hi>Copinger</hi> had made <hi>the night before
a rude discourse</hi> (as he tearmeth it) to <hi>Lancaster</hi> of these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
which <hi>Lancaster</hi> disliked. And touching some spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
had with maister <hi>Egerton,</hi> thus he there writeth. <hi>Most
true it is, that he refused to take triall of mee, and of my giftes: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging,
that he was a meane ordinarie man &amp;c. and one that
could not iudge of extraordinary giftes: and withall, most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianly,
wisely, and louinglie perswaded me, to be carefull &amp; cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect
ouer my selfe: to take heede least I was deceiued by the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:774:79"/>
subtiltie of Sathan, and so misse-led: whereby I might endanger
my selfe, both for my liberty, estate, and credit, and also bee an
hinderance to the great cause, which I would seeme to be most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to further. But withall he concluded, that he would bee
loath, to quench the spirite of God in mee, or to hinder my
zeale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In another letter also, to the said <hi>Lancaster</hi> from <hi>Copinger:</hi>
concerning other his proceedings with <hi>Egerton,</hi> he saith:
<hi>it cannot bee denied, but that the cause is good, which I desire to
be an actor in: but it is saide by some, that it is impossible that I
should be fit to meddle therein.</hi> He also desireth <hi>Lancaster,</hi> to
deal with <hi>Egerton,</hi> that he might haue <hi>a sight of al the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

these matters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About this time it also appeareth, that <hi>Copinger</hi> fell in
to some dealings with <hi>M. Cartwright,</hi> concerning the
premises: and that he had sent vnto him, the questions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                  <hi>After M.</hi> Cartwright <hi>had receaued this letter from</hi> Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinger,
<hi>he sent vnto him a message,</hi> that he should attempt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

<hi>Besides it seemeth,</hi>

be true, by a second letter of</hi> Coppingers <hi>to</hi> Cartwright, <hi>the
13. of February. Wherin he greatly complaned that</hi> he had
beene put backe from that seruice of god and his church, which he
had in hand, (and that hy his frends:) he desired M. Cartwright
that the day appointed for conference might holde, <hi>and hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

hee writeth very cunningly, touching <hi>Coppingers</hi> que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
and shifteth it ouer (like his craftes-maister) with
an indirect and vncertaine aunswere. But in these
pointes hee is very plaine: vz. that hee <hi>had shewed Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pingers

the best of their Ministerie: that their Church was not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful
to do al good offices, for the weale of the brethren here: that
there was a writing ready to send to</hi> Germany <hi>to</hi> Iunius, <hi>that
he would trauaile with some of the good &amp; wel affected professors

it may be performed, when it please God. The next terme, (you

you shall find, that I will be glad of your christian conference, or of
any other brothers, by whom I may be enlightened. Lord deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
mee, from that pride of heart, to reiect or refuse that while I
liue. That course you speake of, intended by you, I was neuer (you
know) in particular acquainted with. And therefore, for mee
to like or dislike a matter, that I had no knowledge of, had beene
(I take it) without ground or warrant. Onlie I confesse, I heard
some buzzes abroad, of a sole and singular course, that either you,
or some other had plotted in his head, which was greatly feared,
and condemned of the brethren. What that was, as I know not,
so had I small reason to speake of it with preiudice. Onelie I would
wish you, and all that beare good will to the holie cause, in this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous
age of ours, to take both your eyes in your handes, (as they
saie) and to be sure of your ground and warrant, before you striue
to put in exeecution. For as I like not of coldnes of zeale, vnder
colour of discretion: so on the other side, I think that this sentence
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:774:82"/>
of our sauiour <hi>(be ye wise as serpents)</hi> was not written in vain
neither, and had great neede to be practised of some in this age.
A sanctified cause, (you know) would alwayes haue a sanctified
course. Our rule and square, must be the word of truth, which
so long as we lay before vs, as our leuel, we shall not lightly swarue
much from the marke. The Lord therefore direct vs, in these
feareful and miserable daies, and let not our infirmities be a barre
to his mercies. I know, (my good Brother,) that the greatest
workes of the Lord: are wrought by the weakest instrumeuts, least
men should boast in the arme of flesh. And therefore, (were it
not for my sinnes and vnworthynes,) I could easilie perswade my
selfe, in regarde of my weaknes, that the Lord might effect some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by me, who am priuy to mine owne wants, and farre short of
those good giftes, it pleaseth you (of your loue) to loade mee with.
But this worke, that you speake of, (howsoeuer the instrument bee
compassed with weaknes,) must sure be wrought by a more san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
heart, then my selfe can yet without hypocrisie boast of. And
therefore, though in affection and good will I ioyne, yet I resigne
the honor of the worke, to those, that the Lord hath more enabled.
The man you speake of, (if he be at Oundhell,) dwelleth hard by a
Sister of mine, and thereupon I shall haue the better occasion to
see him, when it please God. Forget me not in your holy praiers
and meditations, and salute good Giles with many thankes, whose
debtor I am in the Lord. Blessing vpon Syon: confusion vpon Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell:

him, and other discouragementes) yet now the Lord hath not
onelie enabled him to fight, but at the length (in some sort, to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish

a holy fast, in regard of the afflicted Saintes in generall, &amp;c. <hi>He
greatly</hi> commendeth the Ministers cause and suffringes, that are
in prison, assuring himselfe that God will blesse all the actions in
it. <hi>He saith, there were diuerse</hi> out of prison, lying hid, that
in this great worke were hammering their heads, bestowing their
braines,<note place="margin">Hacket and his fellowes.</note> and spending their spirites: who doe hope (in short tyme)
to be brought forth into the sight of their and your enemies, to
defend the cause you stand for: whose presence (God assisting
them,) will daunt the enemies more then yours: for that they be
men voyde of learning, wisedome, and gifts, such as can challenge
nothing to themselues, but must giue all to God: who in all the
greatest workes, that euer haue beene wrought, hath vsed the
weakest meanes, least men should boast in the arme of flesh. And
therefore (I beseeche you) cheare vp your selues in the Lord: for
the day of our redemption is at hand: and pray, that the hand of

to take part with you in this cause.</p>
               <p>Here (you see) he was growne to a wonderfull resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But yet there is another letter of his, that wil make the
same more euident, and likewise lay open more plainelie,
some of the premises, then hitherto they haue beene. Hee
sheweth therein, that hee could be still well contented,<note place="margin">The Copy of Cop. letter to a friend 21 May. 1591.</note> 
                  <hi>to
haue some conference with Maister Charke, Maister Trauers,

               </p>
               <p>You haue heard before, how these Ministers haue refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

thinke, the cause might be? Surelie a feare they had: least
he shoulde (by entring into some particulars) bring them,
within the compasse of his dangerous complots. This may
be necessarily there also gathered, in that as shewing hee
could be content, to conferre with the said parties, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
(he protesteth) that he would seeke any approbation
from them: so doth he likewise remou that doubt, saying,
that <hi>he purposed not to acquaint them with the courses, which he
purposed, by Gods assistance, to take in hand, whereby great daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
might growe to them, and little good to him: but that they
might be witnesses of his humilitie, &amp;c.</hi>

Whereunto it should seeme, that (although at the first he

                  <hi>for satisfying mee in

                  <note place="margin">4. Iune. 1591.</note> and after dinner, he beganne his Pageant, vz.
to crie out against certaine of her Maiesties most honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

to haue heard Maister Cooper: but seeing a Surples lie there, he
departed thence, and went to</hi> Maister <hi>Egertons</hi> Sermon. At
night, <hi>not knowing where to lie, hee went to Wigginton: where
he mette with Coppinger, and by Wiggintons appointment, hee
lodged at Maister Lawsons.</hi> The next morning, viz. the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth
of <hi>Iune,</hi> he proceeded with his slanderous outcries
against the said honorable Councellors: and so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
two dayes after. In the one of which two dayes, <hi>hee
was commaunded,</hi> (as is sette downe) <hi>to goe out of Paules by
London gate, and say:</hi> by your leaue London: <hi>because hee

                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> in the streets, of exclaiming against
such persons &amp;c. did proceede (as it seemeth) by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise,
or at least by the allowance of <hi>Wigginton.</hi> For it
appeareth vnder his owne hand, that he approued (after
his fashion) such outcries in the streetes to be lawfull, by
two examples: <hi>one out of</hi> Iosephus, <hi>and an other of a Yorke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire

I desire you to send me a Coppie of a writing, which you
had from Maister Cartwright, vppon the Court matters, when
Goodman Hacket was with you the first time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Also, shortlie after the aforesaid outcries were finished,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:774:85"/>
and many other things thought vppon amongst them,
(you may be sure to such seditious purposes:) the end of

that <hi>Cartwright</hi> and the other ministers in prison,
should haue come to their answere openly in the <hi>Starre-chamber.</hi>
Whereupon a Letter was written, by <hi>Copinger</hi>
to his most deare friend <hi>Thomas Lancaster,</hi> the Schoole-maister,
from whom he could keepe nothing, that <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>

Sir &amp;c. I do not denie (good Sir) but I haue now a long
time taken a strange and extraordinary course, but such as hath
offered occasion of suspition, of my not onely doing hurt to my
selfe, but also to the best sort of men now in question, and to the
cause it selfe. But by what warrant I haue done this, that is all.
For if the holy Ghost hath beene my warrant, and carieth mee
into such actions, as are differing from other mens &amp;c. What
flesh and blood dare speake against it, &amp;c. Forbeare to censure me
and such other, as should deale extraordinarily with mee, in the
Lordes busines, committed to our charge, and iudge of vs, by the
effectes which follow: which if you heareafter see to bee wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
great, then let all ordinary men call themselues to an exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination &amp;c.
<hi>And after.</hi> The waste of the Church cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
to be greate, so that there is a place for extraordinary men,
&amp;c. <hi>Againe,</hi> my desire heretofore hath beene to haue hadde
counsaile and direction: but now by comfortable experience, I
finde, that the action which the Lorde hath drawn me into is his
owne: and he will direct it himselfe by the holy Ghost &amp;c, <hi>To
conclude,</hi> I beseech you <hi>(saith he)</hi> to shew this letter to M. Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers

these wordes, which (<hi>Copinger</hi> saith) were ment of
him, in respect of his foresaide letter: <hi>there are some persons
so desperate, that they would willingly thrust themselues vpon the
rockes of the land.</hi> This also appeareth by an other letter,
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning this second sermon,<note place="margin">Copin. to a preacher the 13. or 14. of Iuly.</note> written about the 13. or 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:774:87"/>
it had beene to good purpose, if hee had beene na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
For it seemeth hee was as throughly acquainted
with <hi>Coppinger,</hi> and his fellowes designements, as it may
be well supposed, that <hi>Wigginton</hi> was.</p>
               <p>In my letter (<hi>vnto Charke</hi>) I manifested my selfe to haue an
extraordinarie calling, and signifyed, that the Lord had so called
others besides my selfe, who would approue our selues, to bee the
seruantes of the Lorde, in a high calling. <hi>Againe</hi> the ship (<hi>that
is the Church</hi>) had perished, if the Lord had not immediately
called three of vs, to helpe to recouer it <hi>&amp;c.</hi> My calling is es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
to deale with Magistrates: another hath to doe with
Ministers, who hath written a letter to you of the Citie &amp;c. The
thirde is the chiefe, who can neither write nor reade, so that hee is
the executioner of the Lords most holy wil. <hi>He further</hi> offereth
to acquaint this Minister, with their whole course, and willeth
him to shew this letter to his brethren, and to publish it, where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
hee should goe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hacket</hi> confessed,<note place="margin">Hack. last ext.</note> that being about this time, (as I take it)
with <hi>Wigginton,</hi> the saide <hi>Wigginton</hi> affirmed, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence

did not gouerne well, the people might draw themselues together

               <p>Vpon the 15. day of <hi>Iuly, Copinger</hi> and <hi>Arthington</hi> did
write a iointe letter of purpose to haue drawne <hi>Lancaster</hi>

                  <hi>to one Walkers house at Broken wharfe, where

great account this <hi>Lancaster</hi> and some others were, with

followeth.<note place="margin">16. of Iuly</note> The same day in the morning that <hi>Copinger</hi>

came vnto <hi>Wigginton,</hi> &amp; amongst many things, (as <hi>Wigin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
himselfe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesseth) they told him; that M. <hi>Cartwright
had done more against Antichrist then any in the worlde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, since the Apostles times; and that Wigginton, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
vnto him, and that M. Lancaster was aboue them both,
in the estate of heauenlie glorie, because he had kept himselfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled
from the common corruptions of these times, and had a
most simple hart to God.</hi> Likewise also they saide to <hi>Wiggin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
at the same time, that <hi>Reformation and the Lordes disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
should now forthwith bee established: and therefore charged
Wigginton in the Lordes name to put all Christians in comfort,
that they should see a ioyfull alteration, in the state of Church
gouernment, shortly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arthington,</hi> after being examined said, that <hi>Penry</hi> had
sent him word by a letter out of <hi>Scotland, that reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
must shortlie be erected in England: and that he tooke him (in

that <hi>Penry</hi> was a Prouoker of these men to such their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages:
hoping, that vpon their outcries &amp; proclamations
the people would haue risen. For <hi>he was then in London</hi> to

those, not of the meanest of our</hi> Disciplinarian
<hi>Ministers, and are therby verie pertinent (in my opinion)
to shew the point, I haue in hand, of the brethrens imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the</hi> Scottish <hi>ministers reformation. For I trust (as I
said, in the entrance to this part,) it wil not now be denied
but that great &amp; many threatning speaches are published:
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:774:89"/>
One telleth vs,</hi> that great troubles will come of it, if that bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
may not be suffered <hi>to do what they list: another,</hi> that
they can no longer endure to bee vsed as they are: <hi>another in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:</hi>
that our Bishops shalbe vsed, as they were in Scotland: <hi>and
that there</hi> are moe <hi>of this confederacy,</hi> then can be suppressed:
<hi>another,</hi> that it is more then time, for the hottest brethren to set
vp the Discipline themselues, without any further staying for
Parliaments: <hi>a Synode,</hi> that the people, being first instructed,
are then to bee thrust into the publike practise of the Discipline:
<hi>another man,</hi> that seeing the brethren cannot obtain their wils,
by sute nor dispute, the multitude and people must worke the feat:
<hi>another,</hi> that inferior Magistrates of their owne authority,
within their limits, are to make this new reformation: <hi>another,</hi>
that it is a shame for all the fauorers of this faction, in that for
feare of disturbing of our state, (for sooth,) and offending of her
Maiestie, they had not before this time cast out our Bishops: <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
that there are a hundred thousand of this brotherhoode in
England, who if they come with a petition for the discipline to her
Maiestie, cannot in pollicie be reiected, without danger: <hi>another</hi>
that approoued and worthy men of euerie shire haue already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to this Discipline: that the Eldership is at hande: <hi>that</hi> the
people are inflamed with zeale, <hi>&amp;</hi> that it is impossible to stand
against it: <hi>another,</hi> that there is a deuise amongst them, how to
obteine their desires all in one day: <hi>another,</hi> that Bishops are
to be packing after the Fryers and Monkes: <hi>another,</hi> that they
will haue their Discipline in spight of all the aduersaries of it:
<hi>another,</hi> that it is dangerous to the state, if they haue not their
willes, in regard of the discontentment, which wil ensue thereby,
in the heartes of her Maiesties subiectes: <hi>another</hi> in <hi>effect,</hi> that
the Discipline is like to come into our Church, by such a meanes,
as will make all the Bishoppes heartes to ake: <hi>and another,</hi>
that he is of this minde, that reformation wil not be had without
bloud.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:774:90"/>
Now if any man, to extenuate these things, shal say:
let euery man beare his own burthen, &amp; be charged with
his own particular actions: what some in the heate of their
zeale haue published it ought to haue a charitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
&amp; cannot wel be further extended, to touch any
other: as if al the factioners had entred into such a seditious
conspiracie, as the said threatning speeches do import, I
answere, that some indeede there be, that do cast these &amp;
such like colours ouer this matter, to bleare mens eyes
withall. Some commends their zeale, but not their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion:
some allow their matter, but not their manner:
and some will take vpon them to excuse both: but as yet
I neuer heard any of that crue, but hee would eyther in
one respect or other, find some occasion to commend the
worst of them.</p>
               <p>Besides where so many of any one sect do concurre in
their writings, about any new point: it is commonly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to be the iudgement of them all. And who knoweth
not, that if <hi>Cartwright</hi> and the rest, had not secretly clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
such fellowes on the backs for their zeale, and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their sleeues to see them go so forward, but had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked
them: his earnest reproofe of the first (being their
<hi>Apostle</hi> and <hi>worthy</hi>) would haue preuented all the others
that followed, being his <hi>Disciples.</hi> But if it be true, (that
I haue heard reported) that vpon the comming forth of
<hi>Martins</hi> Epistle: <hi>Maister Cartwright</hi> should say: <hi>seeing the
Bishops would take no warning: it is no matter that they are
thus handled:</hi> Surely those words, from him were enough
to set these men agogge. So as, that which is commonly
reported of great robberies: may fitly serue to satisfie the
bowlsterers of such lewdnesse.</p>
               <p>There are (say they) in such attemptes not onely exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners,
but also setters, receiuers, and fauourers: and in
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:774:90"/>
matters of treason concealers: who are all of them
within the daunger &amp; compasse of law. How this may be
applied, I leaue it, to any reasonable mans consideration,
that shall be pleased to weigh the premisses, aswell
concerning the said threatning speaches &amp; great bragges:
as also the course which was helde, by the ministers in
prison, and those of the <hi>London-fraternitie,</hi> together
with some others, touching the attemptes, which
<hi>Coppinger</hi> and his fellowes tooke vpon them to effect.</p>

so dreameth of a way, howe to worke

to themselues such a manner of calling, who would hazard their
liues, that Christ himselfe, by the abolishing of the Antichristian

others, <hi>do thereupon fast againe, to know which of them should
be so called.</hi> The lot (forsooth) falling vpon <hi>Copinger chiefly</hi>
he is not silent: but maister <hi>Wentworth</hi> (amongst others)
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:774:91"/>
                  <hi>must be of his priuy Councel. He also disclosed himselfe,
(after a sort) as you haue heard,</hi> to certaine of the Ministers
in London <hi>before mentioned: and namely</hi> to Maister Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright,
imparting vnto him his seuerall callings to an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
course for the discipline, &amp;c. His said writings into Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>and</hi> Wiggintons said approbation of an extraordinary cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
<hi>He sent</hi> Maister Cartwright the same propositions, that
Wigginton had allowed: <hi>whereof maister</hi> Cartwright, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
thought, there might bee good vse: <hi>hee signified vnto
him,</hi> that by his calling, he was to take in hand such busines, as
in the eyes of flesh and bloud, was likely to bring great danger to
himselfe, and vnlikely to bring any good successe to the Church:
<hi>he told him,</hi> that if he had not beene discouraged, he had before
that day procured the release of some, that stoode then in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of their liues, <hi>meaning (as I suppose)</hi> Vdall, <hi>and</hi> New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>As he dealt with <hi>Cartwright,</hi> so did he with the other
Ministers, and with some of them more plainely, desiring
still of them all, both <hi>Cartwright and the rest, and that most
instantlie, that he might be conferred withall, offering himselfe
to be altogether ruled by them, either to proceede (if they thought
meete) in his saide so dangerous businesse, or otherwise wholy to
desist and leaue it off.</hi> He also offered to imparte <hi>vnto them
all his designements, as to M. Cartwright,</hi> not onely <hi>in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
what he intended, but also the particular meanes, whereby
he purposed to bring the same to passe.</hi> Afterwardes when
through his acquaintance with <hi>Hacket,</hi> by <hi>Wiggintons</hi>
meanes, &amp; other incouragements giuen him by <hi>an other
of his lay friendes:</hi> and by <hi>Wigginton &amp;c,</hi> that he grew to be
more resolute: hee signifyed the same to <hi>M. Charke,</hi> (not

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Onsider I pray you the policy, which
the saide ministers (mentioned in the
end of the former Chap.) vsed. They
at the beginning, no sooner heard of
<hi>Copingers</hi> conceit of an extraordinary
calling, to worke such great matters:
but by &amp; by, (as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> acquainted with
the fore-saide <hi>Geneua</hi> positions,) they very well knewe,
wherunto that matter tended. And therefore wher-as the
poore misse-led gentleman, would haue imparted vnto
them, al his secretes: they started from that point, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
wholy to take from him any knowledge of them.</p>
               <p>They sent him some cold messages, of their dislike of
his proceedings, (which they after qualified, as it hath
been shewed,) not so much to with-draw him from his
lewdenesse, as that therby if thinges fell out amisse, they
might haue some meanes to cleare themselues, by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
of such their messengers, as <hi>Hockenhull</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
And touching conference that was also by them
denied, and surely vpon good and prouident reasons. For
if therby, they should haue yelded in opinion vnto him,
they knewe it might haue broughr them into apparant
danger. Besides, they were not vnlike by sufficient ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to haue disswaded him, from such a fantasie:
which (as it seemeth) was very farre from their meaning.
And lastly, it was almost impossible, but that in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:774:92"/>
with him of his pretended calling, he must needes
haue made some mention of such particulars, as with their
own safety they durst not haue concealed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; so that way
also his platforme would haue beene dashed. The safest
way therefore, for them was, not to haue any conference
at all with him: and that course (for ought I finde)
they tooke: to the hardning of <hi>Coppingers</hi> hart, and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes:
and to the greate aduenturing of all the mischiefes,
that were intended.</p>
               <p>It was not denied amongst them, (as <hi>Coppinger</hi> sayth,)
<hi>but that the cause was good, which he desired to be an actor in: but
the thing that stucke</hi> in their teeth, was this: vz. <hi>they thought
it impossible that he should be fit to intermeddle in it, without the
endaungering both of himselfe</hi> (as Egerton saide,) <hi>and of
the greate cause which hee would seeme to bee most desirous to
further.</hi> Howbeit though <hi>Egerton</hi> would not take v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
him, to approue his <hi>extraordinarie</hi> calling, (for
feare of him-selfe:) yet (for all the saide daunger) hee
thought it no pollicy greatly to discourage him, when
he qualified his speeches after this sort: vz. <hi>hee would bee
loth to quench the spirite of God in Coppinger, or to hinder his
zeale.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Iosuah</hi> was called <hi>extraordinarily</hi> by God him-selfe,<note place="margin">Numb. 27. Deut. 31</note> to

(as he saide,) with <hi>Copingers</hi> particular platformes: yet
in that he confesseth, <hi>he had heard some buzzes abroade of a

sole and singular course intended,</hi> &amp; doth not only <hi>aduise him

be, but that <hi>Coppinger</hi> was thereby greatly animated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When</hi> Copinger <hi>tolde</hi> Vdall <hi>that certaine</hi> vnlearned
men, then lyinge hid, would shortlie take vpon them the defence
of the cause, which hee and his brethren in prison stood-for, and
woulde thereby daunt all their ennemies, more then they coulde,
<hi>willinge</hi> both him and the rest, ther-vpon to cheare vp them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
(for the day of their redemption was at hand: <hi>I doe
greately maruaile, what</hi> Vdall <hi>thought to bee</hi> Copingers
<hi>meaning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It might well haue stoode with <hi>M. Charkes</hi> duety, (seeing
<hi>Coppingers</hi> full resolution to enter into some desperate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
by vertue of his extraordinarie calling,) to haue
disclosed the same to the state. When he preached in the
<hi>Blacke Friers,</hi> to the brotherhood there, about two days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his said intelligence of <hi>Copingers</hi> resolution, and but
fiue or six daies before their proclamation that <hi>there were
some persons, so desperate that they would willinglie thrust them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
vpon the rockes of the Land,</hi> thereby to haue disswaded
<hi>Copinger,</hi> (who then was present,) or for what other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<hi>I</hi> know not: hee should forth with haue acquainted
the saide rockes also, what boisterous tempestes and viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
stormes had beene ready to assault them.</p>
               <p>In this briefe summary, I omitte the rest of <hi>Wiggintons</hi>
actions, referring you to his fellow <hi>Hackets</hi> iudgement,
both of him and them. They are so apparant, by that
which hath been sayd, as they seeme to me, to be past con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectures.
And I would withal my hart, that all which hath
bene hetherto saide of the other ministers, touching this
pointe, did onely depende vpon probabilities. For then
charity would binde vs to iudge the best. But men may

<hi>Norman,</hi> with 16, or 17. moe, entred by a wile into the

themselues of the castle, <hi>Norman Lesly, Iames Meluin, and

finding him set in his chayre, and crying vnto them: <hi>I am

man, you may be sure, of nature most gentle and most modest,)
perceiuing them both in choller, withdrew them, and saide: This
worke and iudgement of God, (although it be secrete,) ought to

               <p>Some amongst vs in <hi>Englande,</hi> haue laboured very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestlie

would throw some fearefull iudgement amongst the Lordes, so as
some the chiefe of them should not goe aliue out of the place:</hi> as
though there had beene no violent course intended by
him &amp; his associates, but that (in his fond conceit (he had
imagined, that God himselfe from heauen, should haue
shewed that iudgement, for the deliuerance of <hi>Cartwright</hi>
and the rest. And in my conscience, one gentelman of
good credit, not acquainted at all with the <hi>Consistorian</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
in these &amp; such like matters thought so in his hart.
But here this maske is pluckt from such faces as could not

the like murthers, and the doctrine thereof is stoutely
iustified according to the heathenish conceit, of a certaine
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:774:94"/>
tyrant, whom <hi>Cicero</hi> also (a heathen man, but yet of better
iudgement) doth confute.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dionisius,</hi> hauing spoiled the temple of <hi>Proserpina,</hi> at <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cris,</hi>
of <hi>Iupiter</hi> in <hi>Peloponesus,</hi> of <hi>Aesculapius</hi> at <hi>Epidaurus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Proserpina</hi> drowned him not,<note place="margin">Cicer. de na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura deorum lib. 3.</note> as he sayled to <hi>Syracuse</hi>
nor <hi>Iupiter</hi> stroke him in peeces with his thunderboltes,
nor <hi>Aesculapius</hi> made an ende of him by some long &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
consumption, both he himselfe, and many others,
accounted such his sacrilege, to be both iust and lawfull.
And euen so it falleth out, for the murther I speake of. He
that hath eyes to see let him see.</p>
               <p>After the foresaid Castel was surprised, and the <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi>
was murthered, <hi>Lesly</hi> with his company, <hi>Knox</hi> and the
rest kept the same Castel by force against the Gouernor.<note place="margin">The hist. of the church Scotland.</note>
But at the last they were compelled to yeeld it vp: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereupon sent (as prisonners) into <hi>Fraunce,</hi> they were
(by directions there) committed some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and some to other prisons. Howbeit in the ende
they all escaped with their liues, by one meanes or other,
sauing the saide <hi>Iames Meluin,</hi> who dyed in prison, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
commeth in this notable <hi>Consistorian</hi> doctrine, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
of the said heathenish conclusions.</p>
               <p>This we write, <hi>vz. (how all but</hi> Meluin <hi>escaped</hi>) to let the
posterities to come vnderstand, (<hi>saith</hi> Knox <hi>and his fellowes</hi>)
how potently God wrought, in preseruing and deliuering of these
that had but a smal knowledge of his truth, &amp; for the loue of the
same hazarded all. That if that, eyther we (now in our dayes,)
hauing greater light, or our posterities, (that shall follow vs) shal
see a fearefull dispersion of such as oppone themselues to impiety,
or take vpon them to punish the same, otherwise then lawes of
men will permit: if (wee say) we or they shall see such left of men
yea as it were despised and punished of God, yet let vs not damne
the persons that punish vice, (and that for iust cause:) nor yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:774:95"/>
but that the same God, that deiects (for causes vnknowen
to vs) will raise vp againe the persons deiected to his glorie, and
their comfort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Againe if our said seditious persons had preuailed with
the multitude, (in their other plot) concerning their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
of remouing some of her maiesties most honorable</hi>
Priuy Councell, <hi>from her seruice in that place: and in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
others to succeede them, (whom they fancied to
be fauourers of their Discipline): you should haue heard
(I warrant you) no cries of the brotherhood, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
in your streets, of any of that faction. It would haue
beene saide, as</hi> Goodman <hi>taught at</hi> Geneua, <hi>that seeing the
saide</hi> Councellors were enemies to Christes kingdome, and did
seduce her Maiestie now, that God had raised them vp, an <hi>Otho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
or a <hi>Ionathan</hi> to assist them, <hi>why should they not haue
ioyned themselues vnto him? Oh (would some haue said)</hi>
the holy discipline, the holy discipline, the holy discipline: what
Prince or Potentate may resist the holy discipline and prosper? <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
See the hand of the Lorde: when men do faile what God
can doe. <hi>Others,</hi> the greatest workes, that euer were done in the
behalfe of the Church, haue beene brought to passe by the basest
meanes. <hi>Others,</hi> this is the worke of God, and it is admirable in
our eyes. <hi>Others,</hi> thus <hi>Iosuah</hi> being extraordinarily strengthned
by God, threw thirty kings out of the land of Canaan. <hi>Others,</hi>
sufficient warning was giuen, &amp; what would they haue had men
to haue done? <hi>Then should you haue had such a declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or proclamation, as you haue before heard of: penned
(no doubt) by some of the</hi> Consistorian ministers in Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d:

                  <hi>as else where such attempts haue been colored.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewise, if yet thinges had not squared to their likings,
and that they had gone further with good successe in any
violent course against her maiesty, (as it is confessed they
purposed to haue done,) then also the <hi>Geneua-diuinity</hi> must
haue borne the brunt, for the iustification of such extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
iudgementes of God. And thus you should haue
had these matters smoothed ouer, as partly it may appeare
by the assault mentioned at <hi>Sterling,</hi> wherein the king was
present in person: and partly by the <hi>Consistorian</hi> propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
(before set down) touching this point, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, both to be noted in the premises, and also in
those bookes, out of the which the saide propositions are
drawen.</p>
               <p>I will not trouble you any further with <hi>Ifs,</hi> although I
could adde, that if the said traitors had proceeded on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
with their confessed purposes, to haue touched her
maisties estate: there wanteth no lesse defence, by <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinarian</hi>
learning, for such a matter, then for the premises.
You may remember the seditious &amp; intollerable propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
before mentioned, as they are truely collected out
of our own countrey mens books, infected at <hi>Geneua</hi> with
that pestilent doctrine. Many examples also would haue
beene brought, for that purpose, out of <hi>Buchanan, Beza,
Knox</hi> and the rest of that humor: especiallie the graue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
giuen by <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Wollocke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Histo. of the Church of Scotland. pa. 372. 373.</note> generally against all
Princes, but particularly then vrged and effected, by the
deposing of the king of <hi>Scots</hi> grandmother, from her ciuil
gouernment of that land. And peraduenture a part of the
said <hi>Knox</hi> his exhortation to <hi>England</hi> written from <hi>Geneua</hi>
the twelfth of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1559.<note place="margin">Exhort pag. 91. 92.</note> (as soone as he hearde of her
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:774:96"/>
maiesties possession of the royall Crown of this Realme,)
would haue beene iustified: where he saith, that <hi>no power,
nor liberty, ought to be permitted to any state, degree, or authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
(whatsoeuer they bee:) to liue without the yoke of Discipline,
&amp;c: and that if Prince, King or Emperour, would enterprise to
change or disanull the same, he ought to be reputed an ennemie to
God, and therefore vnworthy to raigne aboue his people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus you see how al these treasons, if they had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
with what <hi>Consistorian</hi> zeale they might haue been
defended afterward, by the <hi>Disciplinarian</hi> doctrine, which
hath beene sent abroade into this Iland from <hi>Geneua:</hi> and
meetely well practised already, in some partes thereof, by
men of that stampe. Whereupon I do collect, (the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
considered) by <hi>Cartwrights</hi> &amp; other the ministers intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
with <hi>Copingers</hi> desperate purposes, that they cared
not what mischiefs had ensued, so they themselues might
haue beene safe. For (as it is most euident, by the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
speeches before mentioned,) there is nothing more
laboured for, amongst that sect, then to thrust their many
thousandes, or some of them into some mutiny or blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
attempt. Their hope was, that vpon any such occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
their chiefe fauourers would not cease to solicit her
maiesty, (for feare of further trouble) to graunt their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
or (at the least) to take some other course, for theyr
contentment, then hitherto (in their opinions) there hath
beene taken. They knew, that whatsoeuer either could
or should fal out, vnder the prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of seeking for Christs
kingdome, and for the extirpation of the present gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Church (tearmed by them to bee so <hi>abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable</hi>
&amp; <hi>Antichristian,</hi>) if it had good successe for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised
platformes, yet the said <hi>Consistorian</hi> examples, with
their <hi>Allobrogicall</hi> new learning, would haue borne it out
sufficiently, and maintained it. I pray God deliuer <hi>Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</hi>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:774:96"/>
from these and such like points of <hi>Discipline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For mine own part, I would not haue, vrged matters in
this sort, were it not, that I thinke (in my conscience) it is
more then high time, that her maiesties faithfull subiectes
should learne to know these practises, and withall to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of such sectaries, as (vnder their many, both godly
and goodly pretences) do thus seditiously endeuour to
disturbe the land. And the rather also, I did it, because I
see there are diuerse, that will needes hood-winke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and stop their eares, with the Serpent in the <hi>Psalme</hi>
of purpose, because they would gladly haue these things
smoothered vp. For hereby it will be apparant to our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
that if any such mischiefes, (which God forbid)
shal happen hereafter, they were sufficiently warned, that
both should and might (in good time) haue preuented
them, and withall it would then be found true which <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie</hi>
saith: <hi>vrgentibus rempublicam fatis, Dei &amp; hominum sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutares
