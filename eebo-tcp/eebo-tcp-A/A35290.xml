            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT was on a day, that as Time rode by in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
of the Sun, I reſolved to go in Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
to <hi>Parnaſſus;</hi> and borrowing ſome few
idle hours of that old bald-pated Uſurer to bear my
expences, I weaved me a Hermits Gown of Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
for clock, and took for a Staff a Sun-beam,
and ſo accoutred I went to do my devoire to the nine
Patroneſſes of Poeſie. Where after a long and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
peregrination I arrived; but no ſooner arrived
than I beheld to my aſtoniſhment, the Widowed cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
that once had embraced the Caſtalian Springs
ſweet off ſpring, deſtitute of its murmuring ſociety,
and of the delight it once took in its moiſt kiſſes, and
proſtitute to a new black complexion'd Lover; the
bubling womb whence that progeny was extracted,
being turned to a Grave, where Oblivion lay en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombed;
that treaſury of liquid Pearls that uſed of
yore to enrich old Poets Brains, wherewith they ſo
oft beſpangled their Poems, being quite exhauſted.
Some ſaid it was thence conveyed into little Ciſterns,
and ſo conducted thorough ſlender pipes into a vaſt
Conduit. Others ſaid the thirſty throats of Lovers,
parch't with Beauties Raies had ſwill'd it up. I as
an impartial Judge imputed it to both. Next I
looked round to ſee if I could eſpy the Muſes; but
Time it ſeemed had long ago raviſhed thoſe ſweet
<pb facs="tcp:52129:4"/>
Virgins from that ſolitary place. Some ſaid they
were dead and Coffin'd up in Poets Souls. Others
ſaid, they ſerved as Handmaids to fond Lovers Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramors.
I as an unintereſſed Umpire imputed it to
neither, but judged they were fled to heaven to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
their Bankrupted ſtores. Thus grieved to ſee
my journey fruſtrate, I reſolved however to Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
my eyes with the ſight of that forked moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that once had been the pleaſant Throne where
the nine Virgin Queens were wont to ſit, Crowned
with Lawrel, on a green Carpet wrought with <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re's</hi>
embroidery, tuning their enchanting Laies to

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nts; but turning to behold
it, I ſaw nothing but the Plain whoſe ſhoulders had
once born that huge pile of earth; when ſtruck into
a tranſport with admiration at this monſtrous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Time, I was told by the ſtanders by, that
ſome Modern Gyants of w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t had born it thence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to ſcal Heaven, and plunder it of its choiceſt
rarities, wherewith to fill the heavenly Coffers of
their minds. Theſe words were as an alarum to
my murmuring thoughts, which now began to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny
againſt my repoſe; whom whilſt I ſtrove to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe,
I heard from a confuſed Maſs of Rocks and
Stones, the moſt ſoul-entrancing-melody that ever
was begotten of the Airs fluid womb; ſuch as would
have compelled a Stoick to ſleep his mind in thoſe
ſoft pleaſures, whoſe every tone ſounded like a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pason,
and all its accents like the very reliſhes and
cloſes of that heavenly Muſick, Angels and beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb facs="tcp:52129:4"/>
ſouls compoſe, when in their Silver Bowers,
they joyn in Conſort, and make the Arches of that
Empyreal Orb reſound the Eulogies they ſing in
praiſe of their immortal ſolace. No ſooner were
theſe Airs convey'd into the Labyrinth of my ear, but
I felt my ſelf confounded with ſudden raviſhment;
when demanding of the Auditory, whether Melody
it ſelf lay interred under that Chaos? Reply was
made, that they were onely ſome few Reliques of thoſe
raviſhing ſtrains <hi>Apollo</hi> uſed to charm ſouls with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
when playing on his Viol he made the Air dance
her rarest meaſures, in thouſands of ſweet forms,
after his nimbly quavering fingers, whoſe melody
made the very ſenſeleſs ſtones become Epicures, who
loath to part with their delight, hoorded up its Silver
ſound in their obdurate, treaſuries. Scarce had my
mind lent attendance to the cadence of their ſpeech,
ere I was ſnatcht I knew not how, I knew not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Whilſt I lay extaſied with this harmony, I
ſaw in a Viſion, a young Muſe in tattered habit, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in her hand the pourtraiture of a man, drawn by
the Pencil of Nature ſo exquiſitely, that it ſeemed
the perfect Character of a Divine Idea, for no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
fancy could deviſe ſuch an excellent draught.
His looks were the Enſigns of ſome eminence in
him, more than humane; ſo that he ſeemed the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of the whole worlds excellencies: The Princely
Air of his countenance ſeeming as a refracting
medium of the beams of an illustrious Soul; that he
almost confirmed in me, that before doubted Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,
<pb facs="tcp:52129:5"/>
               <hi>That Angels are united to bodies.</hi> As I
was feeding my admiration with this admirable
ſight, I heard a voice proclame in my ears, Copy
out this repreſentation. Fain would I have made
my own inability the excuſe of my neglect, and made
anſwer, that ſuch ſuperlative excellencies did tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
my comprehenſion, much more my expreſſions;
and that it ſufficed that they were their own blazons,
ſince none could ſufficiently emblazon them; and
as for me, I would imitate the adorers of the Sun, not
being able to encircle his head in a Lawrel Crown,
I'de ſacrifize ſome few Poetick Flowers to his praiſe.
Theſe thoughts reſtored my revolted ſenſes to their
Offices, when no ſooner awaked, and that I had
taken acquaintance with my ſelf, but I ſaw the
Muſe that appeared to me in my Viſion, who came
running to me, and preſently Midwived ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts,
that my Brain was then in travail withall;
which when born ſhe wrapped up in ſome ſcattered
plumes that the Muſes had left behind them, and ſo
preſented it to the Nurſery of wits the Preſs; which
(Reader) here I devote unto thee. Who if thou
beeſt one of thoſe whoſe ſqueamiſh ſtomacks nauſeat
every thing, but what's of their own dreſsing, I
ſhall not wonder if thou canst not empanch this ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt-garbage,
ſince the rarities of a more curious
fancy, Cook't by a cleanlier Muſe, offend thy palate.
Doubtleſs Brains is the beſt ſauce for this ſort of
diſhes, but Neceſſity is the beſt Apology. Want and
ſordidneſs are like <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Achates</hi> inſeparable
<pb facs="tcp:52129:5"/>
coitinerants. As her youth may eaſily excuſe her
want of skill to weave a fine-ſpun-webb wherein to
array her Progeny. She is not yet emancipata, and
therefore no wonder if not ſo ſinewy, vigorous and
ſprightly, as thoſe that have arrived to the third or
fourth climacterical. The way then for thee to ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
thy own Genius, is not to feed on theſe jejune
weak conceipts, but rather on ſome more polite, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate
piece of thy own compoſing, whoſe excellency
may be ſet off by the foil of my deficiency; for ſo
men augment the Suns refulgency, by comparing
them with the gloomy ſhades. Again, if thou beeſt
one, who ſetteſt up theſe few Pictures of my fancies
confuſed Ideaes, in the Gallery of thy thoughts,
thinking to adorn it, with the quaint alluſions, acute
Criticiſms, high-flown raptures, and big-ſwollen
words, that may be expected to fall from a Pen that
endeavors to limn out the pourtraiture of Vertue;
let me anticipate that wonder, a rational conjecture
tells me an unexſpected deluſion will create in thee,
by telling thee before hand, this Cabinet encloſes no
ſuch treaſure. I cannot tell which I was moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
in, in my perambulation, whether to forget to
paſs thorough <hi>France,</hi> and there to have adapted
my tongue and pen to the moding complements
wherewith that Ceremonious Nation ſo neatly give
the lye to themſelves; or elſe that during my abode
in <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> I could not procure ſome of the golden
Fleece, which <hi>Jaſon</hi> with the <hi>Argonautes</hi> brought
from <hi>Colchis,</hi> of which to have ſpun my Muſe a
<pb facs="tcp:52129:6"/>
gliſtering Veſture. I muſt confeſs, ambitious I was
to ſtrut it with the moſt boyſtrous and <hi>Alla-mode</hi>
Royſters of our times, and therefore ſent my Wits a
Wool-gathering, to ſee if they could pick up ſome
locks of it, and thats the reaſon they come home ſo
ragged. Some though they live in the frozen Zone
of a <hi>Plebeian</hi> ſtupidity, will yet apparel their minds
in fuſtian, which ſure is the reaſon they Cough and
ſpit out ſuch Phlegmatick conceipts; which oyſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
dotes, they will (in deſpite of any) fancy to
enſhrine the richeſt Pearls. To bolſter up a crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
invention with fungous words, and putid phraſes
(methinks) makes the deformity more apparent.
Volumes filled with ſuch empty inflations, inherit the
Office of a foot-ball. As I ever hated ſuch barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſms,
ſo I never delighted in complemental falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
and as I am a ſtranger to Silken language, ſo
neither am I familiar with the expreſſions moſt in
Vogue. My endeavors have been rather to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neate
humors and affections, than to affect humorous
delineations. Or again, if thou beest a Lover, I
marvail not if thou eſteemeſt this Poem reliſhleſs, if
thy eye dazled with the Rays of Beauty, can ſee no
luſtre in this ſhady repreſentation of that Paſſion:
for there wants that pure Vestal fire, that ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
my thoughts, and diſtill my notions into a quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence.</p>
            <p>Or laſtly, to be brief, if thou beeſt ſome Antick

at firſt the abundance of delight, for a while
overwhelmed her Melancholike paſſions, but recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her ſelf, ſhe thus began to complain, What fatall
Star is this whoſe Peſtilential influence doth afflict me
with ſuccedaneous ſorrows, and makes me daily fill
the air with Complaints, as if my ſoul were griefs Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer?
Miſery and deſpair hath arreſted all my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
that all my words and thoughts are ſteeped in brine
ſorrows, and not a part of me, but is forced to bear
<hi>a part</hi> in this Conſort, to make a <hi>horrid harmony</hi> in woe.
My tongue, the Organ of my ſoul, blown by the ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Bellows of my heart, never ceaſeth its mournful
tones, whilſt the tears flow in ſuch unmeaſurable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
from the floud-gates of my Eyes, as if my very
Soul would be diſfuſed out of thoſe perpetual ſtreaming
ſluces. Not a thought but is ſacrificed to him, on the
Altar of a conſtant mind. And that that confounds me
with endleſs woe, and makes my woes endleſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found,
is not only an utter deſpair of ever being bleſt
with the fruition of him (which alone were able to kill
a lip-ſick Lover, who with quaint Rhetorications can
paint his Miſtreſs face, and curl her hair with better
art than ſhe her ſelf, and think her tears love philters,
each ſentence a heart-charming Exorciſm, and every

worth and valour, and all that might render him excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52129:9"/>
I am wholly ignorant of. But Ah! my Soul,
how dareſt thou entertain a diſhonorable thought of
one, by externals, Natures Minion, and thy darling?
would Nature have Compiled ſo beautiful a fabrick, to
be a receptacle for a deformed ſoul? Certainly ſhe
would not have made ſuch a Cabinet, but to place a
Jewel in it, and that of no mean value neither; do we
not ſee how ſhe hath framed the heavenly Orbes,
of a more pure quinteſſential nature, than theſe courſe-grained
Elementary bodies, ſet with gliſtring ſpangles,
garniſhed with millions of golden Scutchions, and all
to be a fit Pavilion for the Sun, the worlds great Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral?
And what is this dull <hi>blockiſh</hi> earth, but for blind
Moles, Dens of wild Beaſts, graves of dead putriſying
Corps, and at beſt for man to tread on? and as for
Trees, Plants, and Flowers, do we not ſee how they
not induring to be impriſoned within its bowels, break
forth, ſtriving to aſcend, and leave it; but that the
Earth as loth to part with them, fetters them by the
roots; And wherefore hath ſhe made this Microſm,
Man, the Epitome and total ſumm of all the worlds
Excellencies, but that it may befit to contain ſuch an
Angelical Soul? And will ſhe now be ſo prepoſterous,
as to make <hi>Pauſanias</hi> excell all in beauty, but that he
excels all in vertue? But what's all this to me? I do
but Tantalize my ſelf with theſe fond thoughts, ſince
cruel Fortune ſeparates me from him.</p>
            <p>Thus ſhe walked, regardleſs whither ſhe went, until
ſhe was ſurprized with a glimmering light, appearing
through the leaves and boughes; the ſuddenneſs
whereof ſilenced her incompoſed thoughts, ſo that
now ſhe be took her ſelf to ſee, what ſhould cauſe theſe
twinkling ſparks of light; and having gone ſome few
paces forward, ſhe came to a little Plain, at the foot of
a Hill, where lay the Relicks of a ſtately Edifice, as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52129:10"/>
might plainly appear by the ruins of it, upon which there
ſtood a Chapel defaced by Antiquity, ſo that it was
rather venerable than beautiful, only the ſituation of
it made it ſeem one of the ſweeteſt places in the earth;
neer the Chapel, there was a Cryſtall Rivulet, whoſe
curled ſtreams ran ſoftly along, murmuring that their
Envious purſuers would crowd them thence ſo ſoon.
And paſſing through a Grove ſhe came to the Chapel,
and entering into it, ſhe eſpyed a Lamp, and an Ink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn
and Paper lying upon a Table of Stone; ſhe took
the Paper, and looked into it, in which were written
theſe Verſes:
<q>
                  <l>Then muſt I live, and will none pitty lend,</l>
                  <l>By ending me, at once to put an end</l>

                  <l>Then when (O Soul) wilt flye and leave theſe Chains,</l>
                  <l>Wherewith this Body cloggs thee, and theſe pains,</l>
                  <l>Theſe never ceaſing pains, tormenting fires,</l>
                  <l>Which daily burn, to feed ſome fond deſires?</l>
                  <l>But (Ah!) poor Soul, long ſince th' art fled and gone</l>
                  <l>To her, 'twixt whom ther's ſuch an union,</l>
                  <l>Made by affection, that although by death</l>
                  <l>I ſhould this body to the grave bequeath,</l>
                  <l>Yet ſooner can thy ſelf diſſolved be,</l>

                  <l>To looſe that Union, which Love makes ſo ſtable.</l>
                  <l>Paſsions are like the flame, which once being felt</l>

                  <l>Th' Idea is th' Impreſsion, which receiv'd,</l>
                  <l>Of it the ſpirit ne'er can be bereav'd.</l>
                  <l>What then if thou above the Clouds wert fled,</l>
                  <l>And left this clayie body, pale as Lead,</l>
                  <l>

What wilt avail, if when thon doſt diveſt</l>
                  <l>Thy ſelf of it, thou canſt not be at reſt?</l>
                  <l>Though left this Priſon, if theſe paſsions fly,</l>
                  <l>And ſtill bereave thee of thy liberty?</l>
                  <l>If when this body's burnt, and in an Urn,</l>
                  <l>Yet then with greater endleſs fires doſt burn?</l>
                  <l>Only this hope remains, that though they may</l>
                  <l>Aſcend great Natures dictates to obey;</l>
                  <l>When thou their flaming Center doſt attain,</l>
                  <l>They with that fiery Element will remain.</l>
                  <l>Mean while to all vain pleaſures bid farewell,</l>
                  <l>Since th'art exil'd from her that doth excell</l>
                  <l>What Earths vaſt Wombe, or Heavens influence,</l>
                  <l>Did e're produce, all other excellence</l>
                  <l>Is but an Empty name, if not in her,</l>
                  <l>She is the ſubſtance, others ſhadows are;</l>
                  <l>They'r wiſe, fair, vertuous, if like her, for ſhe</l>
                  <l>Is Wit and Beauty, patience, chaſtity.</l>
                  <l>Then ſince by cruel fates, we parted are,</l>
                  <l>Henceforth I will be wedded to deſpair.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>She read the Verſes, and her own Experience made
her to pity the Author, ſo that more out of Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
than deſert, ſhe commended them; conſidering
alſo they were the lines of one ſubmerſt in ſorrows, and
therefore unable to ſoar aloft, on the wings of an airy
fancy. And having pauſed a while, ſhe heard a ſigh
accompanied with a ſilent, but a deep-fetcht groan,
which was eccho'd back by another from her, being
moved thereto by the thoughts of her own hard for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
which thoughts made her the more to pity him,
whoſe condition ſo neerly reſembled hers, inſomuch
that a Pearl-like tear was ready to diſtill from her Eyes;
but her curioſity putting her upon a farther inquiry, ſhe
took the Lamp, and went to the place whence the air
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52129:11"/>
convey'd thoſe ſad accents to her ears. The firſt Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
that preſented it ſelf to her view, was one in black
upon a bed, and ſeeing him poſſeſs'd with Sleep, Deaths
image, together with his pale looks, ſorrows continual
concomitant, ſhe almoſt thought he was a Carcaſe, not
a man, but that ſhe remembred ſhe heard him ſigh.
About his wriſt was a Bracelet of Hair, in which were
wrought in Letters of Gold theſe verſes,</p>
            <p>
               <floatingText xml:lang="unk">

            <p>With her looking upon the Bracelet, by the dazeling

inſeparable from the beſt Natures, made her thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
her ſpeech to him; <hi>Sir,</hi> whoever you are, that thus
ſeparate your ſelf from the World, by being Cloyſtered
within theſe <hi>doleful</hi> walls, let not a too paſſionate ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
prevail over all the faculties of your Soul, and
Reaſon it ſelf, which ought to be the helm whereby we
ſteer our courſe through the fluctuating billows of
ſorrow. Take advice of one, who though a ſtranger
to you, yet not to theſe paſſions wherewith I perceive
you burn; do not laviſh out your ſelf in a ſpontaneous
grief, leſt your tears prove Omens, and preſage a
greater evil. Tears are too brackiſh to quench, and
Sighs are but wind, and more apt to excite than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh
theſe flames; therefore leave this retiredneſs,
and who knows but <hi>Florinda</hi> may be yours, although
hitherto ſome Siniſter frowns of Fortune hath blaſted
your proceedings, which continually attend thoſe who
by Vertue aſpire to Honour and Happineſs.—<hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>'s
ſpirits (for ſuch was his name) receiving ſo
ſweet an alarm, uttered in ſuch a compaſſionate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52129:11"/>
as made it plainly evident, her own paſſions bred
that ſympathy, made him think ſhe was ſome tutelary
Angel ſent from Heaven out of pity to direct him;
and as if the very name of <hi>Florinda</hi> had as it were by a
prophetick Enthuſiaſm thus derived to him, breathed
new life into him, he rouzed up his ſenſes, and with a
trembling, and as it were dying voice uttered this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply;
Who is it that thus by endeavours cruelly mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful,
rips up my wounds, fondly thinking thereby to
cure them? Is that the way to eaſe a grief-burthened
ſoul, to deny all eaſe? ſure the moſt Flagitious Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain
the Earth bears, whom the World abhorrs for his
improbous actions, may not be denyed a leave to
mourn; The moſt inhumane Tyrants that ever plagued
the world with their horrid immanity, when they
ſtrove to make a dying ſoul ſurvive with cruciating
pain, would ſuffer them to bewail their State; ſouls
laden with Woe, though ballaſted with Hope, will ſink
under Fortunes ſtormy frowns, unleſs they pump out
thoſe griefs that threaten deſtruction. But ah! my
heart is toſs'd with the ſurges of deſpair, and charged
with overwhelming ſorrows, which unleſs I ſeek to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthen,
will augment to my unrecoverable ruine.
And what though I ſhould abandon all <hi>Corroding</hi> Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
would that repair my <hi>irreparable</hi> State? would
that regain <hi>Florinda?</hi> Oh what more vain than ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding
thoughts? Heaven juſtly thinks me unworthy
of ſo much Bliſs, and therefore interdicts me its enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Oh, if there be any ſparks of pity yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
either put a period to my miſeries, by ending my
life, that I may no longer contemplate in my ſelf a
ſpectacle of woe, or elſe remove this light, that ſo no
Object may be preſented to my eyes, that may divert
my mind from the thoughts of deſpair, and leave this
penſive place to me alone, being fit for none but thoſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52129:12"/>
devoted to miſery, that ſo I may take my fill of ſorrow,
ſince nothing without <hi>Florinda,</hi> will give me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
but that wherein there is no content. And
with that he fetcht a deep ſigh from the Heart, which
intimated where the diſtemper lay, which <hi>Cleodora</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſhe was at firſt perplext in her mind, not knowing
what courſe to ſteer; one while ſhe deſpair'd of ever
framing conſolation able to appeaſe ſuch vehement
ſorrow, and therefore according to his deſire thought
to leave him a prey to his paſſions; but then compaſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
would utterly forbid that; at length the natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
that is iucident to all humane ſpirits of knowing
others afflictions, with the hope of giving ſome eaſe
by her adviſe added, cauſed her thus to break ſilence;
Sir (ſaid ſhe) though the black clouds of Deſpair have
ſo over-ſpread your Soul, as that there is not the
leaſt ray or glympſe of hope, whoſe bright aſpect
might revive you, yet let it not cauſe you to degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from Vertue, which makes the poſſeſſor inflexible
under all adverſity, like the rock that remains unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
though aſſaulted with the impetuous rage of the
hoiſterous Winds and roaring ſurges of the troubled
Sea. He in whoſe rich Soul Vertue hath once taken
up her reſidence, hath always a <hi>Halcion</hi> ſerenity
within, whatever the tempeſtuous changes and <hi>chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
of Fortune may be without; ſuch a one is placed in
the mids of the variety of Viciſſitudes, as the Centre
in a Globe, which remains fixt, notwithſtanding all
the Gyrations and ſucceſſive <hi>Changes</hi> of poſture in its
adjacent parts. Hence Vertue to a wiſe man is not
only as a lofty mountain, on which he may overtop
the miſty region where Fortune minteth and <hi>Contrives</hi>
her various accidents, but as wings, that tranſport his
Spirit above the Stars, by which means he over-rules,
controules, and bridles them at his pleaſure, and hath
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52129:12"/>
a greater influence on his own felicity, than all the
Conſtellations in the Heavens. And though there are
none have a Charter of Exemption from the enmities
of croſs miſchances, yet can they not infringe a wiſe
mans happineſs, ſince it depends not either on For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
inconſtant ſmiles, or the uncertain diſpoſitions
of men, but on the conſtant and certain exerciſe of
Vertue, which ſad misfortunes can no more impede,
than the air can oppoſe the lights penetration. Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
will ſhine through the thickeſt clouds of adverſity,
nay, its luſtre will then moſt appear; that ruſt which
with too much eaſe is apt to contract, is ſcoured off
by the filing of adverſe fortune, like the fire that lies
hid in the boſom of a ſlint, content with its own
warmth, and never <hi>ventures forth</hi> out of its rocky
dwelling, nor appeareth to the view of others, unleſs
rouſed by the Steels rude <hi>knocks.</hi> Hence Calamities
ſhould be the exerciſe, not the overthrow of Vertue,
and therefore to be overcome with every infelicity ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
rather too much of a Feminine Spirit, whom Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath not indulged with that Heroical power of
ſelf-Conqueſt, which is indeed the greateſt victory.
Therefore forſake any other retiredneſs than that into
your own vertue, where you may Sanctuary your ſelf
againſt Fortunes aſſaults, and impart a relation of your
condition, and who knows but theſe black lines of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
may tend to a centre of happineſs, which if my
<hi>Fortunes</hi> can in any meaſure avail to produce, aſſure
your ſelf you ſhall not be more ready to deſire or
command, than I ſhall be to obey, in what I may have
the happineſs to ſerve you.</p>
            <p>Theſe words were as water caſt upon thoſe flames
of Love, but as wind to thoſe ſparks of Honour that
lay buried in the aſhes of <hi>ſorrow,</hi> which it kindled to
ſuch a dame, that Honour got the victory over Love,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52129:13"/>
and rendred his reaſon triumphant, which <hi>Cleodora</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured
by a Crimſon bluſh that over-ſpread <hi>Perian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
face, and diſpoſſeſt ſorrows pale ſymptomes. At
length <hi>Periander</hi> returned her this reply. <hi>Madam,</hi>
(ſaid he) your Expreſſions ſpeak you no leſs rich in
Vertue than Beauty, my grief muſt have preſſed me
a degree beneath humanity, if ſuch weighty reaſons
couched under ſuch Eloquence could not have coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſed
it. I ſhould be more ſavage then the
Beaſts that <hi>Orpheus</hi> charmed into civility, ſhould I
remain inexorable to the intreaties of ſo ſweet an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
whoſe perfections are ſuch, that I cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it as great a glory to obey you, as it would
make me ſenſible of ſhame to refuſe any thing you
ſhould command, though it were to ſacrifice my life
and honour, which are the only Jewels I ever prized
in my proſperity, and which is all that Fortune hath
left to my diſpoſal in my adverſity. Therefore though
it be to rip up my wounds and make them bleed
afreſh, to acquaint you with my ſtory, which cannot
be done without recollecting thoſe thoughts, which
are as the ſource of all perplexing agonies, yet becauſe
it is in obedience to your command, I ſhall not refuſe.
Know you then in the City of <hi>Corinth,</hi> there dwelt a
Nobleman, by name <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> who as he was equal
to any, both for deſcent, being derived of an ancient

ſo he did excel all in the place where he lived
for liberality; He was both magnificently expenſive
in his gifts and preſents, to thoſe whom Birth and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
had made his equals and ſuperiours, and almoſt
prodigally liberal, <hi>in his ſupplying the neceſsities</hi> too of
his inferiours, and in neither exceeding the bounds of
mediocrity. But eſpecially when publick occaſions
required it, he was a Preſident to all, admired at by

moſt, and envyed at by ſome, whoſe malice, though
it made them repine and carp at his actions, yet it
could not ſtir the ſpirits of others any farther than to
retort thoſe malicious detractings with the greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
upon themſelves, ſo that the calumniating darts
which they with ſuch peeviſh violence caſt, thinking to
wound his Honour, flew back with the greater reproach
upon themſelves. Now as <hi>Corinth</hi> did reap the fruits
of <hi>Eleutherius</hi> his magnificence, ſo the City did repay
him with reſpect and honour; And as Fortune had
heaped ſuch favours upon him as made him ſeem her
darling, ſo Heavens bleſt him with a Son and a
Daughter, whoſe incomparable excellencies were
ſuch, that as their Parents were an Honour to them,
ſo they were to their Parents, and both were happy
in each other. But eſpecially ſuch was the <hi>raviſhing</hi>
beauty of <hi>Florinda,</hi> as that it did attract the eyes and
hearts of all; All her Vertues, and Graces, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments,
were as ſo many nets to inthrall each be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder.
Among the reſt, it was my unhappy fortune
at a feaſt, to view that beauty, which had captivated
ſo many; As ſoon as ever ſhe came, I felt my ſelf ſo
ſtrangely tranſported, as if my ſoul had been <hi>ſnatched
ont of my eyes,</hi> the ſparkling glances that came from
her eyes were as ſo many <hi>Charms</hi> that <hi>inchanted</hi> me
into a paſſionate Feaver. The changing my colour
ſufficiently diſcovered the convulſions of my mind,
one while bluſhing, ſeating leſt my ſtollen views
ſhould betray my diſtemper, and then deſpairing
thoughts would cauſe a paleneſs to over-ſpread my
countenance. Thus I continued one while blaming
my eyes for giving entrance to thoſe deſires that had
wholly ſtollen away my heart, then my mind for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
thoſe thoughts which fed thoſe deſires, and
cauſed that torment. No <hi>delights</hi> could give me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52129:14"/>
whilſt that <hi>delightful</hi> object was preſent.
A faint qualm made me nauſeat the rarities which were
provided, onely my eyes fed upon <hi>Florinda</hi>'s rare per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
which the more they fed, the more I pined,
and remained the leſs ſatisfied; and thoſe melodious
Conſorts of Muſick made the greater diſcord in thoſe
paſſions, which had ſo furiouſly agitated my ſpirits, and
at the beſt bred a melancholy, which as fuell did but
foment the flames. The variety of company did
but abridge the freedom of converſing with my
thoughts.</p>
            <p>Thus did <hi>Florinda</hi> tyrannize over my affections, till
at length Night, which puts no difference between the
rareſt Beauty and the greateſt deformity, and cauſes all
things to return to that Chaos, out of which they
were created, cauſed her to withdraw, and ſo ſeparated
us. But alas, though theſe beauteous rays which had ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
my heart, were Eclipſed by Nights black veil, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could reſtrain the Eyes of my thoughts from view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Picture which my fancy had limned in my mind.
But as the Moon is the cauſe of the various eſtuations
of the Sea, ſo her Idea cauſed ſuch Ebbings and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of paſſion, as would not permit the leaſt repoſe,
which I termed an amorous Lunacy. Thus for a time
I ſtrove to retain my paſſion a priſoner within my breaſt,
till a convenient opportunity tendring it ſelf, being
not able to endure the torment, I diſcloſed the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of my affections to her, which were no ſooner diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
but I perceived alterations in her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
modeſty and diſdain ſeemed to contend for <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority;</hi>
the former by rendring her the more amiable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
my ſlames, and the latter my deſpair; ſo that I
ſtood like a priſoner at the Bar, expecting the ſentence
to be paſt upon him. But <hi>Florinda</hi> which had by her
Eyes diſplayed the thoughts of her mind, did more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52129:14"/>
them by her expreſſions, telling me how diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
ſuch diſcourſes were to her; and that ſhe could
not but look upon them as tryals of her <hi>levity,</hi> and that
ſhe was none of thoſe whoſe over-fond Credulity
made them yield to the allurements of men, whoſe
hearts and tongues ſeldom concurr, but firſt with falſe
perſwaſions enſnare, and after deſert them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
caſt ſuch a blot of contempt upon them, as no tears
nor repentance can wipe away. That ſhe rather
thought my words proceeded from an inſolent deſire of
tyrannizing over her, than from any ſincerity in me, as
I pretended. But my words could not be ſo diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to her, as hers were to me; my looks had been an
invincible Argument of my integrity, if ſhe had view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them with an Eye leſs Cruel than Charitable; for
my ſpirits which before, ſear had cauſed to retire to my
heart, were now ready to take wing, but that they
were recalled by the ſudden arrival of the waiting wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
which gave me occaſion to take leave of her, with
whom it was death to part. Home I went, fraught
with a thouſand perplexing agonies, fluttering about my
ears like birds of prey, devouring all thoſe Cates of
conſolation that Hope would ſet before me. Neither day
nor night could give any eaſe to my torments; ſleep it
ſelf, that gives reſt to the tyred labourer, made me but
the more reſtleſs, by torturing my imaginations with
the moſt extravagant <hi>Chymaeraes,</hi> that could be fancyed.
Frequent ſolicitations I made, which were not more
frequent, than vain. Till at length theſe ſtorms were
over-blown, by one ſweet blaſt, from her more <hi>ſweet</hi>
mouth, which was ſo much the more ſweet, becauſe it
aſſured me, not onely that ſhe was convinced of the
honor and integrity of my pretenſions, but alſo, of the
reality of her affections to me. Heavens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to what an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie
did theſe words raiſe me? that joy which had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52129:15"/>
tranſported my ſpirits, without the ſuperficies of
my body, cannot be contained within the anguſt limits
of expreſſion. My ſelf was too narrow to contain my
ſelf. I could almoſt have imagined I had been in a
dream, but that ſuch dreams to me were unuſual.
Exceſs of contentment ſtopped the paſſage of our
ſpeech, but kiſſes and embraces were the language of
our hearts, wherein we both ſtrove to be moſt eloquent,
and each word or ſentence from either ſtrugling for
birth, was ſmothered with a kiſs, and became abortive.
Mutual promiſes and engagements were made each to
other. Nothing we wanted to the conſummation of
our joys, but the joyning of us in Marriage, who were
inſeparably linked in affection; but, alas, this joy was
too great to laſt long, the fates had otherwiſe decreed;
and who can divert its ſtream, or break the Iron Chains
of neceſſity? for thus it happened. Some two days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the day appointed, wherein a happy Hymen ſhould
Crown our deſires with ſucceſs, and our love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
with honor, the Kings birth-day was to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated,
with the greateſt ſolemnity imaginable, ſuch
as befitted the dignity of the Prince, and the love of
the Subjects. All the Gallants of the City did reſort
to the Court at that time, to be both Actors and Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
who appeared like ſo many radiant Stars in that
Sphere, receiving from, and adding luſtre to it. And
to avoid ſingularity, I alſo went, to wait upon <hi>Florinda,</hi>
not imagining the Kings birth-day ſhould be the death
of all my joy and happineſs. Nothing but Tiltings and
Turnaments, Maskings and Dancings, Muſick, and all
delights that the heart of men could either deſire or
deviſe, the Court did abound in; ſo that it ſeemed an
earthly Paradiſe. And that which added the greateſt
glory to the day, was the dazling train of beauties that
did attend upon the Queen, whoſe glory made every
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52129:15"/>
Eye greedy to gaze upon them, amongſt whom was
<hi>Florinda,</hi> who appeared like <hi>Diana</hi> amongſt her
Nymphs. Never did Eye vowed to <hi>Cupids</hi> ſervice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
a more lovely face. A <hi>Tinſell</hi> veil did ſhrowd
her locks, and ſtrove to cover what it could not hide.
Her ſparkling Eyes darted flames of love into each be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders
heart, and ſeemed to be like two Cryſtall
thrones, where <hi>Cnpid</hi> ſate triumphant; neither was the
King himſelf able to withſtand theſe beautiful aſſaults,
but of a King became her Subject; and though the
Queen had beauty enough to have quencht any ſuch
diſloyal flames, yet when the King compared her with
<hi>Florinda,</hi> ſhe ſeemed but for a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oyl of <hi>Florinda</hi>'s beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Great enquiry he made after her, who and what
ſhe was; and though every one was able to ſatisfie him
in that, yet none was able to give contentment but
<hi>Florinda,</hi> whom the next day he ſent for to the Court, by
a Gentleman of his own Bed-chamber. Accordingly
ſhe went, little thinking her loyalty to her Prince ſhould
contradict her fidelity to her Lover. All ſhe feared was,
leſt this unexpected accident might cauſe me to ſuſpect
her conſtancy. But Kings as they cannot brook Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors
in rule and power, ſo neither will they admit
of Rivals in affection. So it was wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h King <hi>Acaſtus,</hi>
who hearing not onely how we affected each other,
but alſo how deeply we were contracted, it did at firſt
ſtartle him, and cauſe his love to degenerate into jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie.
But remembring the ſword he bare was ſharp
enough to cut in ſunder ſuch Gordian Knots, and
thereby able to make himſelf ſole Monarch of her,
who ruled over ſo many hearts, he ſentenced me to
baniſhment, the better to ſecure her to his poſſeſſion,
who already poſſeſſed his heart. But all the while
this tempeſt was gathering over my head, did I remain
ignorant, till an Officer from the King, came to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52129:16"/>
me with his Majeſties command, how that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pain of death I muſt not be ſeen within any part of
his dominions after ten days. He had no ſooner deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
his meſſage, but if as the transforming influence
which was in <hi>Meduſae's</hi> head to metamorphiſe all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders
into ſtone, had been in him; So did I remain
more like a lively ſtatue, than a living man. At length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
my ſelf, I told him that I would obey the Kings
command, but I knew not the reaſon of that ſentence;
He anſwered, neither did he, but the Kings will. I was
no ſooner parted from him, but with all ſpeed poſſible,
I went to <hi>Eleutherius</hi> houſe, thinking to acquaint <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi>
with the Kings Decree, and the hope of having
her partaker with me in my exile, did for a while ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
the <hi>raging pains of ſorrow;</hi> but when I came and
found all my hopes blaſted in their bloſſoms, with the
fatal tidings of <hi>Florinda</hi>'s invitation to the Court, to
what degree of ſorrow was I <hi>tranſported?</hi> my baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from my Country, was worſe than death; but
to be exil'd from her, was worſe than ten thouſand
deaths. However, before my departure, I reſolved to
take my laſt farewell of her; and to that end, with a
heart ſwollen with grief, I went to the Court, but
when I came there, ſooner might any one have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
a rape upon <hi>Danae,</hi> when ſhe was incloſed
within the Brazen Tower, ſo that <hi>Jupiter</hi> was fain in a
Golden ſhower to deſcend into her lap, than have ſpoke
with <hi>Florinda,</hi> impriſoned in the Kings arms. Onely
thus far Fortune ſmiled upon me, that as I was paſſing
by, thinking to have bid adieu to thoſe Walls, more
happy than my ſelf; <hi>Florinda</hi> chanced to eſpy me
thorough the window, ſhe opened it, and flung down this
Bracelet, as the laſt pledge of her never-dying affection.
When I ſaw her, how did I at once bleſs and curſe my
happy unhappy fortune! happy to ſee her, but unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py

to ſee her in that <hi>ſorrowful</hi> condition, more unhappy
to think, that I muſt never ſee her more; on the other
ſide, the thoughts of our ſeparation did as much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
her. The fear leſt her Keepers who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
in the room ſhould diſcover this paſſage, did for a
while impriſon her ſorrows within her Breaſt, but at
length being not able to conceal it any longer, it brake
forth at the <hi>windows</hi> of her eyes, and diſtilled in a <hi>Pearly
ſhower (more precious</hi> than that Golden one, in which
<hi>Jove</hi> was <hi>transformed)</hi> upon her Lily cheeks.</p>
            <p>Thus for a while, not being able to part, we tarried,
but then not being able to tarry, we parted. The Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
I took up, and with a thouſand kiſſes tyed it about
my arm, and with it home I went, where I took what
I thought convenient, and departed; and riding along,
hapning upon this place, where you find me, I entred
into it, and ſeeing it agreeable to my condition, and
with a mournful ſilence to ſympathize with me, here I
reſolved to ſpend the reſidue of my days.</p>
            <p>And thus you have my ſtory, wherein I ſee no other
crime I have committed, either to merit the Kings
heavy ſentence, or your cenſure, than this ardent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
which may ſeem to reliſh of too much levity;
but that may eaſily be connived at by them, who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted

and remembring her words, wherein ſhe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

to poyſe her words, yet ſeeing ſuch weighty arguments
as Love and Honor at the end, it could not but ſink
deep into him, and ſway his judgment to the latter, to

            <p>By this time <hi>Sols</hi> reſplendent Rays had exhaled the
Cryſtall drops of dew, that hang like iiquid Pearls on

when as <hi>Cleodora</hi> arriving at the Palace, retired
her ſelf to her Chamber, where we leave her to her

you with his Adventures, who had not travelled
far, muſing upon his paſt happy condition, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

a ſudden voyce, which was not more ſudden than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhing,
and the more aſtoniſhing, becauſe uttered
in ſuch a manner, and that in theſe words. Oh! bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Villaines, can ſuch Treachery, and Cowardize,

beheld at once a ſpectacle of pity and revenge, a young
Knight beſet with four armed men, threatning him with
the cruelleſt of death, both in words and looks. His
youth, beauty and valour would have moved any that
had the leaſt ſpark of true nobleneſs in them to revenge
his quarrel, againſt thoſe villaines who diſcovered the
horrid impiety of their minds by their deformed aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects,
but eſpecially his condition, for though he had
almoſt ſlain one, and dangerouſly wounded the reſt, yet
through loſs of bloud began to faiut, and ready to yield
himſelf a priſoner unto death, leſs cruel then his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
(as appeared by his pale looks, which had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
redneſs, than what they received from his own and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52129:18"/>
enemies bloud.) Which ſight did ſo animate <hi>Perianders</hi>
courage, as that with a Lyon-like fury, he flew upon the
firſt, and ſheathed his ſword in his bowels, but ere he
could recover his weapon he was wounded in the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
by another, which <hi>Periander</hi> feeling, it ſo increaſed
the flames of his fury within him, as that it flew in ſparks
from his Eys, &amp; enraged he fell upon him, never ceaſing
till he had ſeparated his murderous Soul from his body,
&amp; made both him and the other the Trophies of his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.
<hi>Periander</hi> leaving them weltering in their gore,
turned to <hi>Athalus,</hi> for ſo was the young Knight named,
thinking to revive his dying Spirits, and to acquaint
him with the death of his enemies. But <hi>Athalus</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

of death) with the preſence of this ſtrange Knight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan

well as owed his life to him, after millions of thanks
returned, deſired him to accompany him to his Caſtle,
which was not far diſtant from them, ſo that <hi>Periander</hi>
accerting of the invitation, they in a ſhort time there
arrived, which for its magnificence might more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
be termed a Palace, being invironed with a Wall
of Stone, whoſe height enviouſly ſeemed to hinder
them from beholding the Fabrick it did encompaſs.
The Pillars on which the Gate was hung, were made

Gilded Griffons, whoſe Wings ſpread with the ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and cloſed with its opening, by the means of a

When they were entred in, they came into a ſtately

the Nine Muſes, each holding a melodious Inſtrument
in her hand, wherein the Artificer ſeemed to excell
himſelf, for underneath the Pavement there was a
ſecret bubling Spring, whoſe Streams were through
Pipes conveyed to each Statue, ſo that at the turning
of a Silver Cock, as if they had been inſpired with life

would ſound with ſuch melodious conſent and

ſo that with what he ſaw and heard, he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
himſelf in a Paradiſe, where the more he admired,
the more he deſired to ſtay, to ſatisfie his Curioſity,
and yet the longer he ſtayed, the more his admiration
was augmented. But <hi>Athalus</hi> faintneſs would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any long delay, ſo that into the Caſtle they went,
where the ſpacious Rooms were hung with Arras, Tape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
and Cloth of Tiſſue, &amp; adorned with lively Pictures.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Athalus</hi> had taken ſome repoſe, and repaired

entreated him to relate the occaſion of the quarrel,
at whoſe requeſt <hi>Athalus</hi> thus began: Sir (ſaid he) the
obligements I have received from you are of ſo high a
nature, that I cannot but acknowledge them above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital,
there being nothing of an equal worth with
Life, which I muſt acknowledge, I have received from

deſires as Commands, and my diſobedience to them as
Rebellion againſt the Laws of Nature; therefore to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie

he out of affection to her, and I out of cordial love to
him, but ſtill he miſconſtrued all, and there wherein I

thought I moſt pleaſed him, I moſt offended him, he
interpreting all <hi>I did to him, was done to her,</hi> ſo that
though his love to me was not preſently converted to
raging jealouſie, yet it ſoon begot ſuſpition, which is
jealouſie in its infancy, which I aſſoon perceived, by
the conſtant watch his eyes kept. Home we returned
to try what ſucceſs Fortune would crown our loves
withall; but as if the Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

croſs our affections and our happineſs together, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda</hi>
had placed her delight in <hi>Plivio,</hi> and <hi>Arriteſia,</hi>
the object of <hi>Plivios</hi> delight, was pleaſed to eſteem
of me, far above my deſerts, and above <hi>Plivio;</hi> ſo
that this was the ſpring and ſource of all our future un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs;
for <hi>Plivio's</hi> jealouſie by this was daily aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
and begot hatred, and hatred made him put
the worſt conſtruction upon each thing I ſaid or did.
He took my viſits to <hi>Matilda;</hi> to be only pretences,
thereby the more ſecurely to rob him of <hi>Arriteſia,</hi> and
the cold entertainment, and ſlights he received of
her, to proceed from thence (which latter was truth)
though I was both innocent and ignorant. All my
vows and proteſtations wherewith I laboured to clear
my ſelf, did but the more confirm him in his opinion,
ſo that as our love encreaſed, our love diminiſhed.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Beauty is like the Sun, whoſe Beams darting upon a

to <hi>Arriteſia</hi> daily did augment, ſo it cauſed the
flames of our former Friendſhip to languiſh. At length
unfortunately it happened that we both met at once at
<hi>Pirotes</hi> his houſe. As ſoon as ever we ſaw each other,
anger and jealouſie made our blood ſo boil within us,
as our paſſions were ready to over-flow the banks of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility,
and make us commit an Act of the higheſt rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

               </hi> (ſaid

thy friend is apparent, which hitherto thou haſt masked

he charged me they were as falſe as diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and that I wore by my ſide wherewithall to give
ſatisfaction to him, ſince nothing elſe could. And ſo
accordingly we appointed the time, place and weapon;

            <p>By that time <hi>Athalus</hi> had finiſhed his ſtory, night

after many fruitleſs endeavours for his ſtay, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
ſome miles of his way. Having travelled
ſome diſtance from the Caſtle, riding thorough a wood,
on the ſudden they heard behind them a noyſe of
Horſes trampling, and men diſcourſing, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Ambuſh; and looking behind them, they ſaw a Troop of
Horſemen armed with Lances and Spears, whom they
took to be Huntſmen, as indeed they proved, but they
were the prey they ſought after; for they were as ſoon
taken as overtaken, and no ſooner overtaken but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>med,
and bound. <hi>Athalus</hi> and <hi>Periander</hi> amazed at
this unexpected accident, demanded what they
meant? they anſwered that they came to revenge the
bloud of their Friends whom they had murthered,
and that nothing ſhould ſatisfy them but their lives;
which they had no ſooner ſpoken, but one of them pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<hi>Athalus</hi> body with a Spear, ſo that he fell down
dead before them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Periander</hi> ſeeing this, wounded in his ſoul with
heart-breaking grief, craved of them the freedome to
perform his laſt obſequies to his friend. I crave not
my life (ſaid he) for that I ſcorn, now he is dead whom
I prefer above it, I only beg this ſmall requeſt which
humanity cannot deny. After many intreaties they
granted. <hi>Periander</hi> perceiving his hands at liberty,
ſuddenly ſnatched a Sword out of the Villains Scabbard
that ſtood next, and therewithall preſently procured a
Lance, and then fiercely charging amongſt them, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
two of them with one ſhock. The reſt amazed with
this ſudden accident, thought there had been a mutiny,
and were ready to oppoſe themſelves againſt their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
but who they were they knew not, until they
were informed by <hi>Perianders</hi> blows, who had no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
made ſome underſtand who was their Antagoniſt
but he put them paſt all underſtanding. At length the
ſurvivers animated with <hi>fury,</hi> revenge, and ſhame,
unanimouſly aſſaulted him with ſuch violence, that he
no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> being able to ſtand before ſuch a torrent of fury,
was re-taken. Valour it ſelf may be over-preſſed with
the weight of multitude. Now they reſolve to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52129:21"/>
upon him the moſt ſavage cruelty, their inhumane
minds (full of revenge) could deviſe. Some counſelled
one thing, others another, all agreeing that he ſhould
dye a horrid death, but all diſagreeing in the manner
of it: thus extremity of cruelty was for a while a ſtop
to their cruelty. But as theſe barbarous <hi>Senators</hi> were
thus ſat in conſultation, a Stag ſwiftly ruſhed through
the Woods, which put them all into ſuch a fright,
that disburthening themſelves of their Arms, they all
fled, leaving their condemned Priſoner behind them,
and happy was he that was ſwifteſt.</p>
            <p>Thus guilt makes all things ſeem to menace danger,
and like a falſe Medium repreſents every thing as in
an armed poſture, ready to bid defiance to the

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Periander</hi> ſeeing himſelf thus miraculouſly releaſed,
arms himſelf, and mounted, purſues his jaylers, and
thoſe whom he could overtake he ſent to the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ernal
priſon, to anſwer for this their horrid barbarity. But
long he could not ſtay to ſatisfie himſelf with the
ſlaughter of his bloud thirſty enemies, but he returned
to pay his laſt debt to his friend, and to ſee whether the
wound was wholly mortal or not; but when he found
the cruel Spaer had thruſt his Soul out of his Body,
how did he fall down and embrace him, and kiſs his
pale cheeks! how did he ſigh, as if with thoſe ſighs he
could breathe new life into him! and groan, as if with
thoſe groans he could awake him out of his endleſs
ſleep! At length he was ſo overcome with grief,
that he fell down ſenſeleſs upon his more ſenſeleſs
friend. But he continued not long ere his ſpirits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to the performance of their natural function,
and he thus bewailed his condition. Hard hearted
fate, (ſaid he) that wouldſt ſuffer ſuch vile miſcreants
to diſlodge ſo brave a Soul! what a ſpark of Honour
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52129:22"/>
hath this ſtream of Bloud from his ſide extinguiſhed?
thus doth Fortune make me a mark to ſhoot her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venom'd
Arrows at, as if the ſeparation from <hi>Florinda</hi>
was not enough to torment we (with endleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable
torture) but I muſt be robbed of my dear
friend <hi>Athalus.</hi> Ah <hi>Athalus!</hi> can I ſigh forth thy
Death, and not my Soul expire with the cadence of
that deadly word? better had it been for thee to have
died before, couragiouſly fighting, when thy enemies
carkaſſes would have been monuments of thy valour,
than thus to be barbarouſly aſſaſinated by inhumane
Villains, more ſavage than the Beaſts that inhabit this
wilderneſs. Oh why did my Spirits return from that
pleaſing trance, to make me thus ſenſible of my miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries?
Fortune I ſee will compel me to ſurvive the
Funerals of my own happineſs.</p>
            <p>As he was thus mourning and complaining, there
came a youth tripping along like the wind, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Stag, which paſſed not long before; his habit
and lovely ſhape made <hi>Periander</hi> almoſt think he was
<hi>Diana,</hi> but that too much virility appeared in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.
His Hair hung in waving Curles upon his
ſhoulders, which the wind, the better to diſplay his
comelineſs, wantonly toſſed from his face. His looks
were ſomething wild, yet withall there was ſuch a
mixture of Civility, as diſcovered his birth and merits
did deſerve a better habit; for he was girt with a
skin, his arm bare, and a Bow and Arrows in his hand.
He no ſooner eſpied that heap of Carkaſſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he
left his ſport, and fled homewards with all ſpeed, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
with the ſpectacle. But as he was going he
checkt himſelf for his fooliſh cowardiſe, to be afraid
of he knew not what, ſo he reſolved to return, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to reſolve himſelf what they were, and coming
back he met <hi>Periander,</hi> who was following this ſtrange

Youth, not willing to loſe ſuch a guide; but the Youth
not knowing what he was, bent his Bow, and was
ready to ſhoot at <hi>Periander;</hi> which he ſeeing, deſired
him to forbear, and told him he was one in diſtreſs, and
that he was dragged by Villains into this wood, whence
he knew not how to return. The Youth told him that
he was as unacquainted as himſelf in thoſe deſerts, and
therefore could not direct him, but he would lead him
to his Cave, where there dwelt an old Hermite that
would and could aſſiſt him. So following his Convoy,
in a ſhort time he arrived at the Hermits Cell, whoſe
ſweet retiredneſs, and retired ſweetneſs would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
any to ſolita<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ineſs, and a contemplative life, but
thoſe whoſe earthly Souls are involved in the Worlds
cares, or drencht in Epicurean delights, for Nature had
carved his Manſion out of a Rock, with ſuch curioſity, as
would have puzled the greateſt Artiſts to have imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Underneath there crept a little Rivulet, which
with its bubling ſtreams bedewed the Rock with Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal
drops, as though it wept <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or its impriſonment,
and ſometimes with ſilent murmurs ſeemed to intreat
for its inlargement. Round the Caves mouth there
grew a ſhady Grove of ſpreading Oaks, whoſe
buſhy tops protected it from the Suns parching beams.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Periander,</hi> whoſe ſobbing Breaſt was filled with
ſorrow for the death of <hi>Athalus,</hi> little regarded thoſe
pretty pleaſing delights, wherewith the place did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
him, and with a ſweet, though ſilent El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>quence
ſeemed to bid him welcome. But entring in, he ſaw
the Hermit apparalled in a Gown of Grey, kneeling
upon his Knees, with his Eyes and Hands lifted up;
Gravity was written in his looks, Devotion in his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures,
and Age in both, for his ſnowy Hairs, and ſhaking
Hands argued that the Summer of his Age was paſt.</p>
            <p>Grave Father ſaid <hi>Periander)</hi> my bleeding Wounds,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52129:24"/>
ſighing Heart, and ſorrowful Countenance are better
able to apologize for my rude interruption of your
ſerious Devotions, than my tongue, which if it ſpeak
at all, it can be no other than lamentations of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Fortune. And therefore read there what I
would ſay, which cannot, I hope, but be ſatisfactory.
The Hermit anſwered him, that he knew no errour he
had commited that needed an Apology, except it were
for making a groundleſs Apology, and that if he had
committed any offence, it was only againſt himſelf,
offence being grounded upon injury, and it was himſelf
alone that he had injured, by deferting the healing of
his wounds by his diſcourſe. With that the tears deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
in ſhowres upon <hi>Perianders</hi> cheeks. Ah <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalus,</hi>
that my Death could purchaſe thy Life, ſince I
deſerve not Life, that have ſo neglected thy Death!
A thouſand times I beg thee pardon, but alas, thou
art not alive to give it; happy ſhould I eſteem my
ſelf in the midſt of the greateſt miſery, wert thou but
alive <hi>to ſentence me to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſudden <hi>ſorrowful Rapture</hi> of ſorrow, filled the
Hermit with as much Amazement, as <hi>Periander</hi> was
with Grief; and as the ſuddenneſs of it bred Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſo the ſadneſſe bred Pity; ſo that he wept, as if
the heat of <hi>Perianders</hi> paſſion had thawed his frozen
Age into Tears. At length his compaſſion for Perian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<hi>paſſion was not converted, but</hi> encreaſed to a deſire
of knowing the cauſe of his ſorrow. Alas (ſaid he)
what can I do that am thus informed by the Ears one
way, and by the Eyes another? you tell me Sacrifice
muſt give place to Mercy, and yet you Sacrifice your
ſelf to Cruelty; for what greater Cruelty can there be
than to be Unmerciful to thoſe over whom Fortune
hath exerciſed her greateſt cruelty? do you not ſee
how the Bloud trickles down in Streams, and your
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52129:24"/>
Armour ſeems to weep in tears of Bloud for your cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
to your ſelf, and your Wounds like ſo many
mouths intreating for mercy? And with that the
Hermit was going to dreſs <hi>Perianders</hi> wounds, but
he would not permit him, until he had gone and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
<hi>Athalus</hi>'s body into the Cave, where after
they had chafed his Limbs, the Hermit took down a
little glaſs, within whoſe tranſparent wall there was
incloſed a Spirit of ſuch a reviving Vertue, as it was
able to recal the <hi>revolted</hi> ſenſes.</p>
            <p>After they had <hi>transfuſed</hi> ſome few drops thereof
into him, his <hi>panting Breaſt</hi> faintly began to beat, his
<hi>unclouded</hi> eyes that had been Eclipſed with a veil of
darkneſs, began weakly to ſtruggle with the <hi>over-daze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
light. <hi>Periander</hi> ſeeing this, began to faint with
joy, but he was quickly revived with <hi>Athalus</hi> his firſt
ſaluting the light. Oh, ſaid he, where am I? with
him, ſaid <hi>Periander,</hi> who is haſtening to dye with you,
ſince it is worſe than Death to Live, while you are
dead: No ſaid he, I am haſtening to live with you,
ſince it is the worſt of deaths to dye while you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live.
But <hi>Athalus</hi> who had hardly ſo much life in
him as to perceive he had life, and yet ſo much as to
diſcern that he was incloſed within a dark place,
which had only ſo much light in it, as to let them ſee
they were in darkneſs, (for ſo the Hermit had made
it, to keep out the intruding air, leſt it ſhould pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
<hi>Athalus</hi> his wounds, and cauſe relapſe,) and
finding that it was not inroll'd in the Records of his
memory, how he came there, he more and more grew
to a perſwaſion that the former conceipt, that he was
alive, was but a deceit, that he and <hi>Periander</hi> were
but Ghoſts, and remembring how that with his life
he had loſt <hi>Matilda,</hi> more precious to him than ten
thouſand lives, he began to faint again, as though he
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52129:25"/>
would dye to avoid Death, <hi>and his ſences ſenſible
of inſenſibility, grew weary of being ſenſible,</hi> and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
themſelves fled as voluntary exiles from
their proper habitation. But the Hermit continuing
his charitable office, recovered him from the confines
of Death. But yet ſo ſtrongly was he confirmed in
that apprehenſion, that he imagined the Cave either
his Tomb, or elſe a dark entrance into that Region of
darkneſs, the Hermit to be Charon, and the River to
be the Stygian lake; the Gloomineſs of the firſt, the
Gravity of the ſecond, and the whiſpering Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of the laſt, ſeeming to combine together to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him.</p>
            <p>And as the Fancy is not only capable to receive
and apprehend thoſe ſpecies, which the external Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
as its Organs, convey into it from external Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
but alſo to create Phantaſmes within it ſelf,
which never had a being in Natnre, ſo did <hi>Athalus</hi> his
fancy repreſent to his eyes Legions of Ghoſts, doomed
to their eternal habitations.</p>
            <p>But though his thoughts were thus filled with
ſhadows, yet were they not able to crowd <hi>Matilda</hi>
thence, but remembring how that in loſing his life he
loſt her, and in loſing her, he loſt the life of his life,
and which only made Life precious, and Death mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable;
he fell to a paſſionate lamenting his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
till he was convinced by <hi>Perianders</hi> perſuaſions,
and a more liberal acceſs of light. And then the very
joy of his ſudden redemption from that Hell <hi>that tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured</hi>
his mind, was ſuch a reſtorative, that it was
not long ere by the Hermits aſſiſtance, he had regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a great degree of ſtrength, ſo that looking about
him, and obſerving the Hermits little ſolitary dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
he eſpied the Youth that attended upon him, and
that directed <hi>Periander</hi> to the Cave. And taking
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52129:25"/>
notice of his Starry Eyes, and beauteous promiſing
countenance, he demanded of the Hermit, who he
was; who to ſatisfie his curioſity, and to paſs away the
time, which otherwiſe through the Melancholy lone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
of the place might ſeem tedious, he told them
this ſtory.</p>
            <p>This youth (ſaid he) is <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ndion,</hi> Son to <hi>Agis</hi> King of
<hi>Theſſaly,</hi> a Prince of ſuch a melancholy conſtitution,
both of body and mind, as that it was rare for the moſt
curious wits in his Court, ever to wreſt a ſmile from
him, or once to diſcompoſe his countenance; always
retiring himſelf within the Cloſet of his thoughts, and
thoſe thoughts conſiſting moſt of horrid matters. And
as melancholy by reaſon of thoſe ſable fumes which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
from that feculent humor, and with a gloomy
darkneſs over-ſpread the mind is the cauſe of fear, ſo
fear is the mother of ſuperſtition, as is apparent in him
who never thinks himſelf ſecure, if the leaſt more of
danger flotes in the air of his imagination; or while
that fear, which his thoughts, ever muſing upon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightful
matters, doth repreſent unto him, hath the
leaſt poſſibility of event. And therefore ever ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all men of evil, becauſe he had not the leaſt ray of
goodneſs in himſelf, to enable him to diſcern it in
others. And this timorouſneſs begat ſuch ſuperſtition,
that each dream was an Oracle, and the Screech of a
Night Raven, an Omen and preſage of ſome future
diſmall event. This over-fond and contemptible fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
rendered him not only odious, but deſpicable
to his people, which he daily more and more percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
ſlighting the former, reſolved to countermine the
latter, if not by honor, yet by terror; and ſince they
would not love him, they ſhould fear him, and their
dread of him ſhould counterpoiſe their hatted. In the
one, as in all things elſe, ſhewing himſelf tyrannical,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52129:26"/>
in the other, as in nothing elſe, truly Royal; there
being nothing more averſe to a generous and noble ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
eſpecially if refined by honor and advancement, than
to be ſlighted; and this he abſolutely determined to
free himſelf from, by puniſhing all in whom there was
the appearance of a crime, and where there was none,
excellency became a fault, by being oppoſite to him,
into whom to have diſtilled any Vertue, had been to
have deſtroyed the very conſtitution and temperament
of his nature.</p>
            <p>And thus a more ſenſible ſervitude came inſenſibly
upon that people, which <hi>Hiarbas</hi> King of <hi>Caonia,</hi> his
Son-in-law, by the marriage with <hi>Melana,</hi> daughter to
<hi>Formoſa,</hi> a man both ambitious and politick, and a

by means of his Spies, diving into the temper and
ſpirits of that people, who though they were lovers of
loyalty and fidelity, yet haters of tyranny, and were
not able to brook ſuch a ſervil ſubjection, reſolved
now to improve his opportunity, and at once both to
free himſelf of jealouſies and fears, and ſubvert the
whole Kingdom of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> by diverting the ſtream
of the affections of the people, from the King, and of
the King from the people, and converting it into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Chanel, where they might flow more ſafely for
the working of his deſigns: And to that end, he had
thoſe in <hi>Agis</hi> Court, who by nothing better, than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing
the people to him, could inſinuate themſelves
into his favour; and thoſe in the Kingdom, who fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
diviſions, by condemning the King to the
people, and emblazoning and pourtraying his vices,
and their ſlavery, the more to encreaſe their hatred and
contempt towards him, and deſire of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iberty to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
by theſe means to make a gap for him, when
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52129:26"/>
things were come to maturity, both to invade and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
<hi>Theſſalia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agis,</hi> though he had many enemies, yet he wanted
not ſome friends, who acquainted him with theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derminings.
The leaſt whiſper of any danger, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm
loud enough, to arouſe him out of any ſecurity, if
it was poſſible for him, ever to have been guilty of that,
a thing ſo diſagreeing to his temper. And therefore he
intercepts <hi>Hiarbas</hi> deſigns, by ſending an Embaſſador
to denounce War againſt him, and to tell him, that
he would ſave him the labor of ſo long a March into
his Kingdom, for he would viſit him ere long in his
own. Though umbrages and light fantaſtick jealouſies
created by cowardly timorous fancies, are too narrow a
Baſis, to found a quarrel upon, yet a preventive War is
both juſt and honorable, and no way diſſonant from all
principles of Policy.</p>
            <p>Accordingly he had ſcarce diſpatched his Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
ere he had raiſed his Forces, and was upon his
March to proſecute his intent, according to the tenor
of the Embaſſie; and to be brief, it was his Fortune
to encampe neer <hi>Dodona's</hi> Grove, a place that had

inquired of the Oracle, whether his undertakings
would be ſucceſsful or not, and to that end at Night,
unſeen, unknown to all, he ſteals from his Guards,
and haſts to the Grove, from which he receives this
Anſwer,
<q>
                  <l>If thou'lt preſerve thy tottering Kingdoms fall,</l>
                  <l>Thy Sons own bloud, then muſt Cement the wall.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This horrid Counſel, though it did both aſtoniſh and
affright him, being uttered in ſuch a manner, at ſuch a
time, in ſuch a place; yet notwithſtanding, that which
did moſt perplex and peſter his mind, was, how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
this intricate <hi>aenigma.</hi> One while he thought
it could be meant of none but his Son-in-law <hi>Hiarbas,</hi>
in which he was partly confirmed, when he called to
mind <hi>Hiarbas</hi> proceedings, whereby he already ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to fulfill it; but then obſerving that term, <hi>thy Sons
own bloud,</hi> by tranſpoſition, he conſtrued it, <hi>thy

though upon leſs groun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, and with leaſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
as will after appear; and indeed upon this only
ground, that it is the Cuſtom of Oracles, to wrap up
truths, within a cloud of ambiguities.</p>
            <p>As he was thus revolving in his thoughts how to
wind himſelf out of this inextricable Labyrinth, he was
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52129:27"/>
interrupted by a ſudden whiſpering noiſe, juſt as if
ſome vapour had aſcended out of the Earths hollow
pores, and whisked thorow the leaves. But ere he had
gone ſome few ſteps further, his attentive ear might
hear two earneſt in diſcourſe. My Lord, ſaith one, can
it poſſible once enter into your thoughts, and not thence
expell all reaſon, that you can withſtand his mighty
force? Certainly, if that hath once his free vote, it
will ſoon tell you, that a people who have been ſo long
unacquainted with War as yours, and have had their
ſpirits debaſed, enfeebled, and unmaſculined, by a
long luxurious and effeminate peace, cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
its rude knocks and blows as harſh and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing;
whilſt your enemies have not only been trained
up in <hi>Mars</hi>'s School, but have had their ſpirits height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by Victory and Succeſſes. What will your Army
ſerve for elſe if you give him battel, but to whet their
ſwords upon, and make them the ſharper to cut down
all oppoſition, that ſhall withſtand his attaining your
Kingdom? and the greatneſs of your force will ſerve
him but to erect the Pyramids of his renown, ſo much
the higher. And however, my Lord, you may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>latter
your ſelf with thoughts, that you need ingage againſt
none but his perſon, conceiving that his death will put
a period to all your troubles, and be the onely means
to inveſt you with the Soveraignty of <hi>Theſſalia,</hi> as the
Oracle fondly adviſes you; I tell you, if you inquire of
Reaſon the only Oracle, placed in the Soul, for man to
follow, it will inform you, that in ſtead of opening a
Gap, to enter and poſſeſs his Kingdom, it will open
the floud-gates for a torrent of ruine to ruſh upon you;
but the beſt and only way to conſummate all their miſery
and ſalve their State ſores; for whilſt he lives, all
thoſe diſſentions, diviſions, and diſtractions, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
have brought the Kingdom to a gaſping conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52129:28"/>
(ſo that they are fain to addreſs themſelves to you
for redreſs) will be rather augmented than diminiſhed.
For as in the Body Natural, ſo in the Body Politick, ill
vapors are not contented alone to diſtemper the head,
but thence, as from a Limbeck diſtilling, diſperſe
themſelves into the whole body, and there beget facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the mother of ruine, and that which above all
things ſtrikes at the vitals of a Commonwealth, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to clip aſunder that bond of Union, which
knits Soveraigns, and Subjects together; and ſo if
you view the preſent condition of his eſtate with an
impartial Eye, you will find that that Kingdom, which,
while all private concernments flowed in one ſtream of
publike good, was able to bear down all oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it, is now cut into ſo many ſmall rivulets of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
intereſts, as that if it obſtruct not their courſe
by War, but let each ſtream flow in its own Chanel,
the whole power of that Kingdom will ſoon be dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up. Whereas were he dead, thoſe who now
out of contempt and hatred forſake the Father, would,
if not out of loyalty and fidelity, yet out of pitty ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to the Son; and all thoſe factions which like miſts
obſcure the luſtre of that Government, will then all
vaniſh, before the rays of that riſing Sun: and if he be
once ſeated in his Throne, you will find it a more than
<hi>Herculean</hi> labor, to crowd him out from thence, or to
wreſt the Scepter out of his tender hands. Rather ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
and part with part, than be forced from all, which
will inevitably be the event, if you follow your intended
reſolutions.</p>

which as it were out of revenge for their blow, with a

their diſcourſe interrupted by ſuch a ſudden noiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
fear and amazement, aroſe, and no ſooner riſen,
but as well as the Nights darkneſs would permit, they
diſcerned <hi>Agis</hi> newly recovered from his fall; whom

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52129:29"/>
not far diſtant from thence; where they committed
him to ſafe cuſtody, untill the light ſhould diſcover
what the darkneſs concealed.</p>
            <p>No ſooner did the morning appear, and the light
diſpell the darkneſs, but this Royal priſoner was called
forth to give an account to <hi>Hiarbas</hi> who and what he
was. I ſhould be guilty of too much profuſeneſs both
of words and time, if I ſhould ſtand to declare, what
variety and contrariety of paſſions domineer'd within
them, when they ſaw, and in ſeeing knew each other.
Hard it is to ſay, whether joy or admiration had prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
in <hi>Hiarbas,</hi> whilſt grief, fear and ſhame conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for priority in <hi>Agis;</hi> This is certain, if any paſſion
did exceed another, when they all exceeded the bounds
of moderation, it was joy in <hi>Hiarbas,</hi> to think that
in him he ſaw the <hi>Exit,</hi> and concluſion of all his
troubles, and grief in <hi>Agis</hi> to think that this was but
the entrance and <hi>exordium</hi> of his, and that now he did
but enter upon the Stage to Act his Tragedial part, in
compariſon of which, all his former Reign had been
only Comical. And indeed no wonder, if he who in
the cleareſt Sun-ſhine of proſperity, when there was
not the leaſt ſhadow of a Cloud that might portend any
danger, but onely the vapours in his own head, or any
enemies to oppoſe, but the inhabitants of his own brai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

could not ſtop the mouth of fear; I ſay, no wonder

            <p>But as fear is a greater evil, than the evil it fears, ſo
it was with him, for <hi>Hiarbas</hi> who ſought not after the
King but the Kingdom, nor the Soveraign but the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty,

ſhewed all Princely reſpect, and honor; and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

what by alluring perſwaſions mixed with threatnings, he
might accompliſh his ambitious ends; and indeed in a
little time they took ſuch an impreſſion upon him, as
procured from him a total reſignation of the Crown
and Dignity of <hi>Theſſalia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to the Army, who when in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they found their King was miſſing, and that after
the moſt curious inquiry of all perſons, and diligent
ſcrutiny into all places, no news could be heard of him,
you would be amazed to hear, what a medly of diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifyed
opinions there was about him, which ro avoid
the imputation of falſhood, I ſhall forbear to recite.
But for their confuſions they were innumerable, being
divided into as many factions, as intereſts, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts

who what by the terror of a potent Army, which he

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52129:30"/>
to all their diſcords, and cauſed them all to Center in an
unanimous ſubmiſſion to his power, ſo that within
ſome few days, he had the Crown ſet upon his head,
by <hi>Agis</hi> himſelf, in the chief City of the Realm, whom
for that day, he brought forth, and to the admiration
of all the people declared unto them, by what happy
Fortune he thus unhappily fell into his hands. But
<hi>Agis</hi> not being able to ſurvive the loſs of his Kingdom,
and having his heart broken with extremity of grief, he
in a ſhort time exchanged his Throne for a Grave, his
Purple Robe, the Enſign of Royal power and Majeſty,
for a Winding ſheet, his Courtiers, for the Wormes,
and infernall ſhades: And thus as Fortune put
an end to his happineſs, ſo Death to his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Hiarbas</hi> though thus carried aloft upon the wings
of a proſperous Fortune, yet he ſoared not ſo high, but
that he was able to look down and ſee, upon what a

And as a Tower, whoſe parts may be ſound and ſtrong,
yet, if held together only by force, is nothing but a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inous
maſs, and ſubject to fall with the leaſt aſſault;
ſo the beſt Government, that hath no other ſupport but
the ſword, and is not cemented by the peoples affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is ſubject to diſſolution, upon the leaſt popular
motion and diſturbance, much more that, where there
can be other right pretended, but what is carved out by
the ſword. And therefore that he might gild over his
ſudden intruſion, with ſome glittering pretences of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52129:31"/>
right, by which he thought to dazle the dim eyes of
the vulgar, he cauſed himſelf to be proclamed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all the <hi>Theſſalian</hi> dominions, heir and ſucceſſor to
<hi>Agis</hi> deceaſed, by vertue of that reſignation which he
enforced from him in the time of his impriſonment.
And that he might for ever remove away all grounds
for <hi>Pandions</hi> hopes, when he came to age, to attain, or
his own fears to loſe the Kingdom, he ſent him to a
Foreſter to be educated as his own, that thus by cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
him to move in ſo low a Sphere, he might prevent
an Eclipſe of his pretended right, which he juſtly fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
would be totally obſcured, ſhould <hi>Pandion</hi> have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed
his.</p>
            <p>And as for the Princeſs, <hi>Pandions</hi> onely ſiſter,
though I cannot but ſay, he hath dealt moſt honorably
with her, having regard not onely to her high deſcent
and extraction, but excellency and worth; for indeed,
what is there that can deſervedly merit the title of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert,
that is not moſt tranſcendently in her? yet fearing
leſt in time, her matchleſs wit and beauty might match
her, to ſome perſon of great eminency, who in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
with her, would eſpouſe her intereſt, he hath
Cloyſtered her in a Nunnery, and made her vow per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Chaſtity.</p>
            <p>And thus did this Politicke man improve his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
whilſt poor <hi>Pandion</hi> born to a Crown is bred up
in a ſervile obſcure condition, having a Foreſt for a
Kingdom, and wild beaſts for his Subjects, with whom
he is daily converſant, exerciſing a pretty kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
tyranny over them, in chaſing ſome, ſettering
others, and killing others, as his fancy pleaſes; and
one day as he ran ſo far in the purſute of a Deer, that he
knew not which way to return, but wandring to and
fro, he happened to eſpy me, walking neer the mouth
of my Cave, and with all ſpeed came running to me. I
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52129:31"/>
was no leſs aſtoniſhed at the beauty of the youth, than
amazed to ſee him in ſuch an unfrequented place; for
during thirty years that I ſpent in this ſolitary place,
I never beheld the face of any here before him, whom
after my mean manner, I have entertained, for ſome
years, not being able to direct him to the Foreſters
habitation.</p>
            <p>This ſtory told with ſo much gravity and deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſo moved <hi>Periander</hi> to compaſſion, as that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to accompany young <hi>Pandion</hi> into <hi>Theſſalia,</hi> and
there by all means endeavor his reſtauration, which
however if he could not effect, yet, he would render
himſelf renowned for his high Attempt, and therefore
bleſſed his Fortune, which though hitherto had been
adverſe to him, yet now had preſented him with ſuch
an happy occaſion, and ſo fit a place for a Theatre,
whereon to Act the Heroick Exploits which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
tranſacted within his thoughts. Neither was
<hi>Athalus</hi> leſs deſirous of acting a part in that honorable
enterpriſe, ſo much of his ſpirits had not ſteamed forth,
from thoſe ſtreams of bloud, as to enfeeble both his
body and mind; but ſtill he was as propenſe to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
any action that required valour for its perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
as ever, but the weakneſs of his body would not
permit him to undertake any thing proportionable to
the greatneſs of his mind. For though the care and
diligence of the Hermit had brought him from a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
of life, yet not out of danger of death, ſhould he
be too negligent of himſelf; ſo that with a ſeeming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
willingneſs he yielded to <hi>Perianders,</hi> and the
Hermits perſwaſions, rather to return to his Caſtle, and
when neceſſity ſhould require, aſſiſt them with Forces
from thence. And though it was the wound uncured
in his body that was the pretence, it was chiefly the
wound incurable in his heart, that made him withdraw<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:52129:32"/>
which nothing could heal but a Sympathetick Plaiſter,
applyed to the Dart that gave the wound, and that
was <hi>Matilda's</hi> Beauty; and therefore to her muſt he
return, if he will ever find eaſe, which accordingly he
determined to do.</p>
            <p>Having made theſe concluſions among themſelves,
they walked abroad to refreſh themſelves, and <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
who for ſeveral days had not taſted the freſh Air, the
Hermit entertaining them with diſcourſes, one while of
the vanity of Sublunary delights, how that their greateſt
perfection is but imperfection, and in their beſt injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
attended with annoy, and how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and fading<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and how unreaſonable for a reaſonable
Soul, of ſuch a <hi>depurate,</hi> immaterial, and ſuperceleſtial
Nature, and therefore a fit ſoil for the moſt ſublime
thoughts and enraviſhing affections to ſpring up in, to
delight it ſelf in ſuch courſe embracements. Then he
would be laviſh in the praiſes of a contemplative life,
the happineſs and ſweet repoſe of ſolitude, how that
freed from the worlds tumultuary diſtractions, and
Corroding cares, the Soul doth mount aloft, upon the
Wings of Contemplation, above the Star-gliſtring
Heavens, and ſatiate her ſelf with Angelical delights,
that reſide in a higher Sphere than Nature, and thence
deſcending taſte what excellency Heaven and Earth
will preſent, which as a ſolemne repaſt, after ſuch
tranſporting and rapturous delights, fills and dilates
the Soul with exceſs of joy and contentation. Can
any humane Artifice (ſaid he) pleaſe and delight the
eye, as it doth the intellectual eye of the Soul, to
ſee with what unwearied ſwiftneſs, the rowling Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
whirl the ſparkling Globes of light? and with
ſuch violence, as if it meant to ſling them out of the
Univerſe, had not Nature there unmoveably riveted
them; to ſee how the envious Moon, as it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52129:32"/>
at her brothers glories, ſtrives maliciouſly to
obſcure and hide them, from the view of the admiring
world, by interpoſing her opake body between it and
the Suns refulgent Beams? and then how the Earth to

               </gap>e that maligne interpoſition, wrappeth her in a

to all ſublunary beings? To read the events of all
things written in Golden Characters, by the hand of
the All-ſeeing Deity? To ſee how the revolutions and
alterations of perſons and actions depend upon their
circumvolutions; what earthly Palace can compare
with that where the worlds great Monarch keeps his
Court? invironed with an Aethereal Wall, whoſe ten
arched ſtories borders upon the Empyreal Palace; moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with a Cryſtalline Ocean, guarded with hoaſts of
twinkling partizans, whoſe gilded ſhields and gliſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Spears reflect back the Suns radiant glances; to
ſee the flaming Courtiers clad in golden Treaſſes, dance
to the Muſick of the Spheres, roving and traverſing
the tranſparent floor with ſuch confuſed order, as if
they meaſured each pace by the ſweet Charmes of the
Muſicks modulations, whoſe harmonious accents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
of diſagreeing concords, ſo they are moſt conſtant
and regular, when moſt irregularly inconſtant. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are there wanting Tiltings and Turnaments, and
feats of Chivalry: for how often doth the Sun himſelf,
mounted in his glory-beaming Chariot, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>od with
burning boſſes, run the Celeſtial Ring, with all his
flaming attendants, purſuing after in their full career,
through Heavens arched Galleries? The Air is his
Kitchin, where his Cates are prepared, the Clouds
the ſteam that aſcends from his boyling Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:52129:33"/>
Thus they went, the Hermit beguiling the time
with his grave diſcourſes, till they came to the top
of the Hill, which proudly elevating it ſelf above the
humble valleys, and levelling plains, bleſt their Eyes
with the moſt delightſom proſpects the Country could
afford; there might you have ſeen Art and Nature
joyn in Conſort, and ſtrive to preſent a moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Harmony to the eyes. There were the natural The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atres
of lofty Hills, where the moſt refined guſts of
air would dance to the warbles of the winged Chori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
chirping under the green Canopies of ſhady
Groves. Vales treaſuring up ſilver Rivers, which
gently gliding, would ſteal away beholders ſenſes; by
which the Shepherds would ſit feeding their Flocks,
whilſt the wanton Lambs would dance to the Muſick
of their Oaten Pipes.</p>
            <p>Not far diſtant, ſtood a pleaſant Town on the ſide
of a Hill, compaſſed with green Meadows, water'd
with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ilver ſtreams of little bubling Rivers, that
ſtrayed to and fro in wanton Meanders; the ſtreets ſo
intermixed with ſhady Trees, ſeemed as if the Woods
had left their melancholy retiredneſs, and grown ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable,
meant to inhabit the Town; or as if the
Town had left its chearful ſociableneſſe, and
grown to a kind of civil wildneſs, meant to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
the Woods, or rather as a marriage between
both.</p>
            <p>Hither did <hi>Peri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nder, Pandion</hi> and <hi>Athalus</hi> repair to
furniſh themſelves, and <hi>Pandion</hi> eſpecially with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and all acouttements fit for their intended under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings,
having firſt taken leave of the good old Hermit,
and returned millions of thanks for his charitable kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
telling him that they counted their preſent unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
chiefly to conſiſt in this, that thereby they were
put in an incapacity of giving due teſtimonies of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52129:33"/>
their gratitude to him, and that if their Fortunes
might be raiſed equal to their deſires, it ſhould be that
they might be able to return requital equal to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts.
The Hermit anſwered, that as his deſerts were
ſmall in themſelves, ſo they would be leſs, ſhould he
be ſo mercenary as to ſhew kindneſs, in expectation of
a requital; but however, if he had merited any thing,
that they had ſufficiently repaid him by their ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>
            <p>Thus after ſome ceremonies paſt between them, they
left the Hermit, who at parting could no longer retain
his gravity, nor refrain from weeping tears of joy and
ſorrow; of ſorrow to part with them all, but eſpecially
<hi>Pandion,</hi> whom he had ſo long entertained as his
Pupil, and inſtilled thoſe excellent principles, the effects
whereof ſhall be made apparent in the ſequel of the
ſtory; but of joy, through the conceived hopes of his
future proſperous Fortune.</p>
            <p>Theſe three noble Conſorts having travelled for
ſome few days together, came at length to a parting
way, which might properly be ſo called, for it was
the means of parting <hi>Athalus</hi> from the other two, whom
we ſhall alſo part from for a time, and leaving him,
aſſociate our ſelves to <hi>Pandion</hi> and <hi>Periander;</hi> who
amongſt many other adventures they encountred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
in their journey, this was one.</p>
            <p>Travelling along one ſcorching day, the Sun darted
his rayes with ſuch vehement violence as that they
were forced to betake themſelves to a neer adjoyning
ſhady Grove for protection, where the ſpreading
boughs ſo embraced each other, as if they had combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
together to exclude the Suns proud beams from
entring there; where being invited by the pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the place, and their own weariſomneſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh
themſelves, they lighted off their Horſes, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52129:34"/>
pulled their bits out of their mouths, turned them
to feed upon the Graſs, which there grew in great
plenty, whilſt themſelves being overcome with the
murmurings of the ſweet bubling ſtreams, and the
whilſtlings of the quivering leaves were lulled aſleep.
But long they had not yielded to ſleeps pleaſing
charms, when their ears were ſuddenly filled with a
ſudden ſhriek, which pierced and rent the air with
ſuch a dividing ſhrilneſs, as plainly appeared it came
from a heart pierced, <hi>rent and divided</hi> with ſorrow; and
withall ſo ſmall and clear, as they knew it came from
ſome Female Breaſt; neither came it alone, but was
preſently followed by a train of doleful groans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which purſued it with hue and cry as a Thief for ſtealing
her joyes from her. They no ſooner heard it, but
they aroſe and guided their ſteps by the mournful
noiſe, till they came to a place where they ſaw a
beautiful Lady lying along upon the ground, leaning
upon her elbow; Nature had painted her Face with
more than ordinary Beauty, ſo that Sorrow ſeemed to
appear in the livelieſt colour; her Face, Geſtures,
Sighs and Tears, and all made apparent, that ſorrow
had tuned her heart to ſo high a Key, that the ſtrings
were near cracking. Loath they were to interrupt her,
and yet deſirous to ſerve her. At length they heard
her fetch a groan, and that ſeconded by a ſigh, and
both uſhered in theſe words. Hard-hearted enemies!
could your tyrant minds invent no other way, to vent
your mercileſs cruelty, but by being thus cruelly mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
to leave me behind to weep his obſequies? what
wrong did you ever receive from his guiltleſs hands?
as nothing could ſatisfie your boundleſs rage, nor ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
your thirſty ſouls but his deareſt bloud? and if it
was I that did the wrong, why did you not ſheath your
Swords in this breaſt, that my Death might expiate his?
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52129:34"/>
and why do you not come and ſteep your ſulphrous
ſouls in my diffuſed bloud, that ſo both they as well
as their horrid actions, their monſtrous of-ſprings, may
be of a Crimſon dye? O ye celeſtial powers, ſince
'twas your pleaſure to joyn our Hands and unite our
Hearts by <hi>Hymens</hi> ſacred and inviolable bands, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodge
this Soul of mine, and take it up into that
heavenly Chorus, whereof he is one, that ſo out of
the reach of dull-browd ſorrow, we may ſing prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Anthems of Peace together, and being no longer
intangled with this Worlds turmoyles, my Soul may
be involved in that bottomleſs Abyſs, and boundleſs
Ocean of immortal happineſs. Oh ſweet Death,
come and welcome, put a period to my Griefs, and
rid me of this dying life; oh how the thoughts of
thy approach revive me! fruſtrate then not my hopes
and expectations, the way to kill me is to let me live.
Oh then augment not my griefs by adding new, let
me not ever languiſh here in perpetual anguiſh; but
come, oh come, and if my enemies have extracted
the quinteſſence of all cruelty, and ſwilled it up into
their parboyl'd Souls, that ſo there is none left for
thee, what then? it is mercy, not cruelty that I crave;
for what greater mercy can there be than to unlooſe a
ſoul intangled and hamper'd with griefs and ſorrows?
oh then unty this knot of dull mortality, that pineons
my ſoul and makes her flutter here below, and let her
fly to him who is my Life, my Heart, my Joyes, and
all that my higheſt deſires can attain unto. And if
with killing him, thou haſt ſpent thy Arrows, for ſure
his great ſoul would not ſurrender up her manſion on
too eaſie terms) here's Shafts within my Heart ſhot
both from Love and adverſe Fortune, enough to fill
thy Quiver, and let that remain full ſtill; Come then
and draw thy Bow, and give that wound that ſhall
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52129:35"/>
heal all other wounds. And therewithall ſhe gave a
ſigh, as if Death had indeed made a divo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ce between
her Soul and Body, and her tender heart had bid adieu
to this lower world, and fled into the Empyreal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions.
But proceeding, <hi>Charon</hi> (ſaid ſhe) prepare thy
Boat to waft me over the <hi>Stygian Lake;</hi> and if thou
feareſt it is too ſhoul to tranſport ſuch a Cargo of Woes
and Griefs as I am filled withall, here's tears enough
that flow in uncontroled Streams from Griefs Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
to make it at its loweſt Ebb, over-flow the Banks,
and if that will not ſuffice, open my Veins, drain my
Heart dry, rather than let me tarry behind; for what
Joys can ever accrew to me, now <hi>Theon,</hi> in whom my
Joys are plac't, hath bid farwell? And then ſhe ſtopt,
giving a groan, as if her Heart had been reſt in ſunder,
and folding her fair Arms, as if ſhe went about to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pandion</hi> and <hi>Periander</hi> hearing this, no longer able
to contain, diſcovered themſelves to her, and craving
pardon for their intruſion, begged to know the cauſe
of her ſorrow, telling her, they would ſpend their dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

my deſire is to be with my dear <hi>Theon,</hi> hand me to the

wept a floud of tears, making her language to ebb.

Nay, ſaid <hi>Roxana,</hi> it is not your valour I
doubt of, but contrarywiſe, it is the heavens mercy
that I deſpair of: for can I think that they who have ſo
frown'd upon me, frown'd do I ſay? rather conſpired
to make me miſerable, have any love or mercy reſerved
for me? for whence can ſuch extremity of cruelty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

renowned acts? where hath not Fame blazed his honor?
who are there that would be liberal, courteous, magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous,

            <p>This <hi>Theon</hi> is Son to <hi>Harpalus</hi> King of <hi>Thrace;</hi> his
Father being deſirous to make him compleat in all
things that were deſirable, ſent him when he was a

thereby to inſtill into him thoſe Vertues both
Moral and Political, which commonly thrive better

wherewith all Princes Courts abound, and alſo

would be better inſtructed in the intereſt of his own,

hands to manage the affairs of State with greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
Vain it would be for me to enumerate the
great adventures he atchieved in his travels, ſince they
were ſo great, as that all the world not onely heard of,
but admired and envyed, and therefore they may ſeem
ſtrange to you, but I cannot think, you are ſtrangers to
them.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other places it was his hap to come to my
Fathers Court, where he had not been long, ere his
incomparable Beauty, unconquerable Valour, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable
Excellencies ſo enraviſh't my affections, that
<hi>Theon</hi> was the Saint at whoſe ſhrine I offered up my

methought I felt my heart chained to his eyes,
and when he ſpake, his lips ſeemed to dance to the

Soul, and led me Captive at the triumphing Chariot of
his conquering Beauty; ſuch Grace, ſuch Majeſty, ſuch
Perfection were united in him, as the moſt curious
quick-ſighed Symmetrians were not able to diſcern the
leaſt diſproportion in him, much leſs mine, which was
wholly dedicated to his Perfections. Neither was he
wanting to repay me with mutual affections, but as
my contentment and happineſs was placed in him, ſo
he ever thought himſelf unhappy without me; and
ſo had affection blinded his judgement, as he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to beſtow large Encomiums on my Beauty, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
me rather like a fond Lover, than a Judicious
Artiſt in Beauties Heraldry; which had it as far tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
his expreſſions, as his expreſſions did me, I
ſhould not have merited his affections. And that that
was no ſmall addition to my Felicity, my Father <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lampus</hi>
was exceedingly delighted in his ſweet Society,
and Witty pleaſantneſs, and brave deportment, but
moſt of all pleaſed with the affections we bare each
other; inſomuch that in a ſhort time, by agreement of
our Parents, the day of our happy conjunction in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
was appointed. Oh that ſweet diſuniting union,

thus it happened, <hi>Theon</hi> and I, walking together, one
Evening into the Fields, we over-heard <hi>Idomeneus</hi> his
Squire, and another quarrelling; what the cauſe of the
contention was, we could not underſtand; this we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
that they were ready to leave their Verbal ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
and betake themſelves to ſharper than any
their Wit could invent, but their immoderate Paſſion
had not ſo renounced the moderation of Reaſon, but
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52129:38"/>
that they could conſider, that neither the time nor
place was ſeaſonable; they made therefore a Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
each to other, to meet next morning at ſuch a
ſet hour, which they both vowed to obſerve. <hi>Theon</hi>
over-hearing this diſcourſe, reſolved not to interrupt
them, but at the time appointed to be an unſeen Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of this combat. I diſſwaded him from both, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the event, but with ſuch faint dubious perſwaſions,
as they nothing prevailed, delighting in his preſence,
and yet taking pleaſure in every thing that delighted
him, though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t deprived me of my deſired happineſs:
for our hearts being one, our deſires and delights muſt

            <p>But when night came, no ſooner had <hi>Morpheus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed
all my ſenſes, and ſleeped them in <hi>Lethe,</hi> but
the drowſie Deity, that forges thoſe wild phantaſms on

for a ſignal Act of Loyalty, to be exempted
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52129:39"/>
from all penalties for any Act whatſoever, excepting
high Treaſon. By vertue of which, <hi>Clauſus</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
poſſeſſor hath committed, and doth continue ſtill
to commit many outrages, impriſoning all Ladies, and
Gentlemen, whoſe hard hap it is to come within their
reach, ſo that there are many now of eminency, who
are there condemned by this Tyrant to perpetual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement.
And not onely himſelf, but all Villaines
whatſoever, that can pretend any relation to him
(though often the kindred conſiſts not in ſameneſs of
bloud, but bloudy actions) have the privilege of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity
for whatſoever wickedneſs they perpetrate. And
by this means this Caſtle hath been as a Neſt of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
a Moth and Canker in the Bowels of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Kingdom, ſo that he hath been ſo tyred out with
the daily complaints of his Subjects, for injuries and
affronts received from them, that he reſolved to raze
the Caſtle to the ground, intending not to leave
the leaſt veſtigium of it, to preſerve the memory of
ſuch a wicked place. A freedom for Vice, is an unfit
reward for Vertue. But he was prevented by a ſubtile
politick trick of <hi>Clauſus,</hi> which was this, <hi>Clauſus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
intelligence of my Fathers reſolutions, and
how the daily provocations from his party incenſed him
more and more, knowing himſelf to be a man of little
leſs than Gigantick bigneſs of body, and to ſay truth,
the greatneſs of ſpirit being proportionable, imagining
himſelf invincible, he hath of late made this Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge,
that what Knight ſoever could overcome him in
the Field, he would ſurrender up his Caſtle to him, and
renounce his privilege.</p>
            <p>This fair and honorable propoſal, my Father conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
to, and for the encouragement of any Knight
to undertake the Combat, he hath proclamed, that
whoſoever ſhould Conquer <hi>Clauſus,</hi> ſhould not onely
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52129:39"/>
have the Caſtle for his reward, but ſhould have the
higheſt honors, his Kingdom was capable to beſtow,
conferred upon him. Hither me thoughts I ſaw <hi>Theon</hi>
diſhonorably dragged.</p>
            <p>I was no ſooner awaked, and freed from my reſtleſs
reſt, and my Dream had forſook me, but a Tyrant fear
ſucceeded it, and uſurped dominion over my amazed
thoughts, ſo that ſpurred on with a diſtracted mind, I
haſtily aroſe, and ruſhed into his Chamber. But when
I ſaw he was gone, and that his ſolitary Bed was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of its happineſs, to incloſe and embrace ſo ſweet
an inhabitant; how did my tormenting fears add wings
to my ſteps? ſo that in a moment before I knew whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I was throughly recovered of my Dream, I
came to the Caſtle, where I found to my miſery, my
Dream fulfilled, and thoſe Villaines triumphing over
his beautiful, though lifeleſs body.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir Knight, ſince you have your requeſt, let
me have alſo mine, that you will not hazard your ſelves
with that cruel Tyrant, but proceed in your journey,
and leave me here to bewail my miſerable condition,
which is the onely ſatisfaction and content you can give
to my unſatisfied diſcontented mind.</p>
            <p>In all things, Madam, ſaid <hi>Periander,</hi> conſiſtent with
my honor, I ſhall obey you, but where thats ingaged,
pardon me, if I hearken rather to its dictates, than
your commands; and, ſaid he, it cannot but reflect
with diſhonor upon this noble perſon, who honors me
with his company, and my ſelf, ſhould we refuſe the
Combat, when there is ſuch high provocations, as the
revenging your quarrel, the redeeming ſo many Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tived
Knights and Ladies, and the freeing the whole
Kingdom from ſuch a common peſt. And what though
I loſe my life in it? life is but a tribute, that we muſt
pay to Nature, and that the beſt and moſt valiant is
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52129:40"/>
mortal, and ſubject to the breath of every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate

think to trample the Stars under her feet, and with
her frowns to Eclipſe the Sun, as to depoſe him that

               <hi>Roxana</hi> hearing this, directed them to the Caſtle,

doubting whether he was able to withſtand ſo fierce an

made him the more deſirous to undertake it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Pandion</hi> being equally ambitious of Honor with
the other, and ſuſpecting leſt <hi>Periander</hi> doubted of his

condeſcended to his deſires, with this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that if he ſaw him in any danger of being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
(which he much feared, by reaſon of his youth)
he would interpoſe, and they would both ſtand or fall
together. <hi>Pandion</hi> gratefully accepted it, and ſo they
paſſed on, till they came to the Caſtle, upon the
Gate whereof hung Armor, all of Silver, upon the
Breaſt-plate whereof there were engraven two An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
holding a Wreath of Laurel, in the midſt
of which was this Impreſſa, <hi>Valours Reward.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <hi>Pandion</hi> having Read the Verſes, drew out his Sword,
and with the Pommel of it, gave ſuch a blow upon the
Armor, that it reſounded through all the parts of the

flaming countenance and fiery look, gave ſuch a rude

his Friends and his own Life, and the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of accompliſhing it, made it ſo ſwell within his
breaſt, with the madneſs of a terrible fury, that to the
deſtruction and admiration of his enemies, he went
beyond himſelf in his atchievements, killing where
he hit, and hitting where he pleaſed, ſeparating ſome
not only their Souls from their Bodies, but their upper
parts from their nether; others that were aiming
where to lodge their blow, with the greateſt advantage,
he deprived of blow and ſight and all: Whilſt <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dion,</hi>
not able to aſſiſt his friend, was forced to refreſh
his fainting body by reſting himſelf upon the ground.
But they were ſoon aſſiſted by the Knights impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
within the Caſtle, who knowing that their Jaylors
were impriſoned by Death, and ſeeing <hi>Pandion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrid

they unanimouſly aſſaulted them, all agreeing in the

though all diſagreeing in the end, ſome fighting
to preſerve their own honour, diſdaining to be enſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by ſuch unworthy Villains; others for their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
ſome out of Love to the Commonwealth, to
quit it from ſuch a neſt of Peſtilent Fellows; others
out of hatred to their enemies; ſo that in fine there
grew a deſperate combat, as it muſt needs—the
Combatants growing deſperate, the <hi>Clauſian</hi> Knights
reſolving rather to loſe their lives by whole-ſale on the
point of the Sword, than retail them out by the hand
of Juſtice, which they knew would befall them
ſhould they ſurrender, grew fearleſs through fear, ſo
that Courage in the Valiant grew deſperate, and deſpair
made the Coward couragious; that at length the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
grew ſo cruel, that the very ground was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown
with a deluge of bloud, and the earth that was
wont to bury mens bodies, mens bodies now buried
the earth; ſo that it ſeemed like <hi>Mars</hi>'s ſowing time,
the ſeeds of cruelty being implanted in each Breaſt,
and watered with Bloud; but like Deaths reaping
time, ſuch an Harveſt of Bodies there lay in heaps,
ſerving as Bridges to tranſport over Rivers of Bloud,

            </p>
            <p>Hard it was to determine which way the ballance of
victory would poize, Fortune for a while carrying her
ſelf a Neuter; till at length <hi>Periander</hi> being a too
partial Umpire, by the mediation of his valour deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the controverſy, ſending ſuch throngs of Souls
of the <hi>Clauſian</hi> Knights, that were loth to anſwer for
their unanſwerable crimes before <hi>Melampus</hi> his Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
to receive their eternal doom, that the ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
yielded, craving mercy, which they found.
Then <hi>Periander</hi> receiving the Keys of the Gate, gave
the Captives that were the Keepers, to the Keepers
that were the Captives, till <hi>Pandion</hi> whoſe right it
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52129:44"/>

Sentinels on the wall, and a watch for that
night, intending the next morning to march in triumph
to King <hi>Melampus</hi>'s Court.</p>
            <p>But no ſooner had each man took his Station, but
their Ears were arreſted with the crys of a Female
voice, which as well as they could underſtand, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
entrance; the Gates being opened, they all
ſtraight knew her to be <hi>Roxana</hi> their Kings Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
who ſeeing the event of the Combat, came with
ſpeed to the Caſtle to perform her laſt obſequies to
<hi>Theon,</hi> and to return thanks to <hi>Pandion</hi> and <hi>Periander</hi>
for their hazardous adventure. And being admitted
into the Caſtle, ſhe was received with all reſpect
and joy, by all the Knights and Ladies there, but
eſpecially by <hi>Pandion,</hi> who bleſt her ears with the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
tidings that <hi>Theon</hi> was yet alive, pointing where
his Chamber was, who would have ſaid more, but
the tranſporting joy, not only divorced all ſorrow from
her Heart, but her Body from the place; ſo that
both his words and thoughts were prevented with her

nay his Heart, nay his Soul was raviſhed with the ſight
of <hi>Roxana,</hi> as if her beauty had been ſome divine quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſential
extract, or ſome ray of that celeſtial fire,
that inſpired life into <hi>Prometheus</hi> Image, he felt a
vigour infuſed into all his fainting limbs, and the
Darts of Beauty to triumph over the Darts of Death,
and her words to blow up the dying ſparks of Life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a flame, ſo that aſſembling all his powers together,
he caſt himſelf into her Arms, his Legs being unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and feeble ſupporters of his Body. But, alas! as
their arms were linked each in other, and their very

Souls intwin'd by a ſweet ſympathy, <hi>Theons</hi> Spirits
that, like the dying blaze of a Taper, before gave ſuch

between the extrems of joy and grief; all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of her Soul being overwhelmed with a ſudden con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.
Two extrems over-flowing Tides of contrary
paſſions meeting together in one Breaſt muſt needs
ſink it in a Whirl-pool of amazement. But ſhe was
recovered from that living trance, by the recovery of
<hi>Theon,</hi> who did but by the ſhortneſs as it were coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
a Death, that he might be buried in that

            <p>What wanton reaks, ſaid <hi>Rozana,</hi> doth Fortune
play, bandying me from one extreme to another? no

followed by a Gentleman that came from her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who having firſt performed his duty to her,

that after the burials of the dead, <hi>Pandion</hi> attending

moſt of the Knights, excepting ſome few that he left
in the Caſtle to keep it in the Kings behalf, marched
towards <hi>Melampus</hi>'s Court; but they were met by a
gliſtring train of Nobles, Knights, and Gentlemen,
ſome coming in obedience to the Kings Commands,
others to meet their delivered Ladies, and all to
bring <hi>Roxana</hi> and <hi>Pandion</hi> to the Court with great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity;
having performed their dutiful ſalutation to

to the latter for his great ſervice to the Kingdom, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
him with what high acceptance his heroick
Act was received by the King, and beſtowing large
Encomiums on his valour; who yet willing that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riander,</hi>
that was ſo great a partner in the victory,
might alſo ſhare in the honour, endeavoured to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the chief praiſe of the Action upon him, extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
his own part, but extolling his, to whom alſo
they performed many Ceremonies; All which being
paſt, they proceeded in their joyrny, beguiling the time
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52129:45"/>
with delightful pleaſancy, till the end of their journy
put an end to their diſcourſe, where they were brought
to the Palace of the King, being conducted into ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Courts, adorned with ſuch beauty, riches, and
pompous magnificence, as tranſported <hi>Pandion</hi> (who
never beheld ſuch State) with an exceſs of aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that he thought <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> could not
have afforded ſo much glory. Such was the gliſtring
habit of the Nobles, as ſeemed to contend with the
golden Pillars which ſhould reflect the Suns rays with
the greateſt luſtre, or rather with the Sun himſelf for
brightneſs; ſuch the rich Attire, reſplendent Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and admirable Beauty of the Ladies, their
Ornaments adorning their Beauty, and their Beauty
beautifying their Ornaments, and both adding ſuch
particular graces to the ſolemnity, that held the Eyes
and Heart of <hi>Pandion</hi> and <hi>Periander</hi> dazled between
contentment and admiration.</p>
            <p>Being convened into the Kings preſence, he aroſe
from his throne, and after he had embraced his
Daughter with joy and affection, turned to <hi>Pandion</hi>
and ſaluted him with as great Condeſcention as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
would permit, telling him that he eſteemed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
beholding to Fortune, not ſo much for ſending
one who by his valour had rid his State from ſuch a
brood of Villains, as honouring his Court, by that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
with the preſence of a Perſon of ſo great worth
as he approved himſelf to be; and requeſted him to
acquaint him with his name, and what he was, that he
might know on whom, as well as for what he ſhould
confer his intended Honour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pandion</hi> (who had reſolved to conceal his name,
knowing that to reveal it would be utterly deſtructive
to his deſign, and therefore agreed with <hi>Periander</hi> to

            <p>Great Sir, ſaid he, the Honour you have already

he led them into the walks, where the lofty Trees
were ranked in ſuch delightful order, as that none
durſt retreat, and all ſeemed equally ambitious of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
foremoſt, their plumy tops, waving with gentle

goodly Gardens, where the ſmooth Lillies were
incloſed with fragrant hedges, underneath whoſe ſweet

had a freſh begun, with pining lamentations, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail
her more pining <hi>Narciſſus;</hi> but er'e he could
conſider what it was, or whence it came, his ears were
arreſted with a train of mournful tones, that followed
their flying predeceſſor, and then a peircing drilling
cry would ſeem to be a treble to a murmuring Groan;
but drawing neer, hoping to find one to ſympathize with
him in his miſery, he heard the voice formed into theſe
words.</p>
            <p>Oh heavens, were it not enough to take her hence,
but you muſt take all mercy with her; alas, what need
is there for mercy, where there is no miſery? there is
nothing but a boundleſs Sea of Happineſs, and here no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a bottomleſs abyſſe of Wo. Oh command
Death to unlock the doors of happineſs, that I may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in and exchange theſe Heart-infringing Groans, for
the Heaven-bred Raptures of that Seraphick Quire
that ſurround the Heavenly Throne, and theſe Soul-melting
Tears, for thoſe <hi>Nectarian</hi> ſtream<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
pleaſures. Come, Death, thou that art ſo prodigal of
thy Darts, to ſhoot a Virgin in the <hi>Aurora</hi> of her days,
whoſe freſh ſmiles would have melted the moſt flinty
heart into mercy, come ſpare a ſhaft to me, whoſe age
aſwell as miſeries inviteth. Oh! why art thou grown
thus prepoſterous to take the young, and leave the old?
would not her Beauty move pity in thy heart? Methinks
her bluſhing Cheeks might have made thee aſhamed
of thy cruelty. How couldſt thou find in thy heart to
thruſt thy Sithe into her tender ſides? Sure, no ſuch
thing as Love could be the cauſe, no, Love never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
in an obdurate Heart. And ah, the Grave is too
hard a marriage Bed, and thy looks too gaſtly for her
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52129:50"/>
to delight in thy cold embracements. Come then to
me, to whom thou ſhalt be wellcome, puff out this
blaze of Life, and let my fledgd Soul take her Wing.
Thinkeſt thou that a few Tears can ſupply with moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
what ſo many griefs and years have dryed up?
No ſurely, long it cannot be, ere my ſublime Soul
muſt bid farewell to all theſe tranſitory Griefs and Joys.</p>
            <p>Having ſpoken this, he concluded with ſuch a groan,
as if he had ended his ſpeech and Life together. But
<hi>Periander,</hi> no longer able to conceal himſelf from, nor
from himſelf him that was the author of theſe ſad lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
which he thought could ſuit with none as with
him, accounting (as it is the property of all men) his
own condition moſt lamentable, diſcovered to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and himſelf to an ancient man apparelled in a Gown
of gray, reſembling a Pilgrims weed, lying along in a
darkſom Cave, the darkſomneſs whereof made it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
a Vaul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a Ghoſt, ſo that he lay as if he had been entomb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
alive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Periander</hi> at firſt ſtood ſtill, having his thoughts di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
between pity and amazement, and gazed upon
him, but then returning to himſelf, he requeſted the
Pilgrim (for ſo he ſeemed to be) to inform him of the
cauſe of his mournful complaints, telling him, that he
had a ſufficient ſhare of ſorrow, and therefore knew
how to bear a part in that doleful Conſort, and that he
had found by experience, that when he had a partner
in grief, it eaſed him of half his miſery, two being
able to ſupport that burthen, that one will ſink under.
And that if it lay in his power, no way elſe to avail him,
yet he could ſympathize with him. True (anſwered the
Pilgrim) but you your ſelf ſay you have a ſufficient
ſhare already, and therefore I need make no addition:
and alas the ſtory of my fortunes would make an Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantine
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52129:51"/>
heart relent, and move pity in a Soul that had
for ever exiled all mercy from it. The relation (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Periander)</hi> may add to my griefs, not to my
miſery, and detract from them, as much as their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
may give eaſe to you, which will be ſome
though ſmall, becauſe one grief concealed, more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
is, than ten imparted. Since you are thus deſirous
(replyed the Pilgrim) of a thing ſo undeſirable, I ſhall
conſent.</p>
            <p>Know then that my name is <hi>Geryon,</hi> by birth a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of this Realm, I had a Daughter (and then the
tears ſtood in his eyes, as doubtful whether they ſhould
leave their Aged Manſions, or continue there) her
name was <hi>Helena,</hi> her Parts and Beauty made her
both deſireable and deſired, by many principal Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in the Court. Many ſuters ſhe had; among the
reſt, there came a young Gentleman, named <hi>Pentheus,</hi>
a man (as I muſt needs ſay) of incomparable worth;
though as I then thought, too undeſerving for my
Daughter, but now I both ſee and rue my pride (and
then the tears guſhed forth, but proceeding) the wealth
and honor of the reſt ſo eclipſed his merits, and dazled
the eyes of my judgement, that I thought him fitter
for her menial ſervant, than a ſervant in affection. But
I diſliked him not ſo much as my Daughter liked him,
or rather I diſliked him the more, becauſe ſhe liked
him, not out of want, but exceſs of over-vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
affection to her. But my hate to him, could
not quench her love to him, but rather encreaſed it,
which for a while was interrupted upon this occaſion.
Often had I forbad him coming to my houſe, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
little leſs than Death, charging my Daughter alſo
upon penalty of my utter diſpleaſure, not to entertain
him in her Arms, or in her heart; but as the latter was
impoſſible for her to effect, ſo the former was attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52129:51"/>
with little leſs difficulty, being as unwilling to do
the one, as unable to do the other; ſo that they continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

ſtill their ſtollen meetings, which was not ſo private,
but it came to my ear, ſo that perceiving, they little
minded my threatnings, I minded little to threaten,
but laid an Ambuſhment to entrap them one Evening,
who paſſing along as they were toying and diſcourſing
and uſing their wonted Dalliances, my ſervants ſtarted
up and apprehended them; her they brought home,
and him they carried into a Wood, that was ſome miles
diſtant from thence, with intentions to kill him, but
they were ſet upon by the Knights of <hi>Clauſus</hi> Caſtle,
and ſome killed, others wounded, and many carried
priſoners to the Caſtle, among which he was one.
Thoſe few that remained and eſcaped, fled in haſt to
acquaint me with the event of the action, which did
then exceedingly delight and content me, ſuch was my
wicked folly, that I never conſidered what would be
the event of ſuch a wicked event; the eyes of my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and judgement being blinded with the dazling
of that happineſs I flattered my ſelf withall, which I
thought nothing then could impede, when ſuch an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle
and impediment was removed away; but ah,
there was a greater obſtruction, my wickedneſs, that I
minded not to remove, which is that that now more
afflicts me, than all the miſery and misfortune that is
inflicted upon me; ſuch is the adverſity that attends
wicked proſperity, and ſucceeds proſperous ſucceſſes in
wickedneſſes, they do but harden the actor in his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormous
courſes, and by that means fit him for inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
ruine, whilſt he taken with the appearing ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of ſuch tranſient happineſs, regards not to repreſs
thoſe exorbitances, which in the end depreſs him with
miſery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:52129:52"/>
               <hi>Pentheus</hi> being gone, nothing now remained, but to
match my Daughter to the moſt deſerving of her noble
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uters, amongſt whom was one <hi>Trebonius,</hi> a young
Nobleman, of great eſtate and power. As his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were moſt vehemently bent towards my Daughter,
ſo were mine towards him, eſteeming him in my over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
judgement as far to excell <hi>Pentheus,</hi> in worth
and excellency, as he did exceed him in riches, though
that worth to my grief I found chiefly conſiſted in
worthleſs wealth and honor. To him was I determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
reſolved to marry my Daughter, and to that end
uſed what arguments and perſwaſions I was able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
upon her affections; but as they were not in my
power to command, ſo neither could ſhe compell
them to obey; which I perceiving, was forced to uſe
my paternal authority, by which at length, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
arguments and threatnings, I got her conſent, not
becauſe ſhe was pleaſed in her choice, but becauſe her
choice was to pleaſe me, ſo that in fine marryed they
were, to my great joy and contentment. But, alas,
what conſtancy is there in humane eſtates? for when
we are ſurrounded with the greateſt proſperity, then
many times are we alſo invironed with the greateſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters;
good nor evil never abiding in one poſture, ſo
it was with me. Little did I preconceive what a part
Fortune, or rather misfortune had to act in this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi-comedy.
But whatever I conceived, that monſtruous
birth, that Fortune was then conceiving, made me a
monſter of miſery, which was Midwived by this occaſion.</p>
            <p>Of late two ſtrange Knights by their valour, killed
the Captain <hi>Clauſus,</hi> took the Caſtle, and redeemed
the priſoners, (all which I ſuppoſe, you cannot be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of, for its not only the diſcourſe, but the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
both of Court and Kingdom) amongſt which he
was one, that was releaſed from that Captivity, but,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52129:52"/>
ah! to be inſnared in a greater Captivity both of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and miſery. For no ſooner was the Caſtle won,
but with all ſpeed poſſible, he ran, firſt to inform the
King, of the Caſtles ſurprizal, and then with greater
haſt, ſpurred on by a deſpairing hope, to inform my
Daughter, the Queen of his heart, of his own deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.
But the firſt object that ſaluted his eyes, was
to behold <hi>Helena</hi> in <hi>Trebonius</hi> arms.</p>
            <p>Here a moſt Rhetorical Orator might have a fair
field to emblazon with Eloquence, the ſtrange diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Paſſions, that abounded in their hearts at the firſt
encountering. He whoſe mind before was diſtracted
between deſpair, and hope, was now wholly diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with deſpair. In his face, one might have read a
combat between the Beams of Love and Beauty, and
Cloud of grief and hatred, and all theſe ſtunned with
a maze of amazement; whilſt ſhe no leſs anſwered his
affection with reciprocal interchanges of Paſſion, at
firſt ſhe bluſhed, as aſhamed of her unfaithfulneſs, and
then looked pale with fear, leſt I ſhould perceive her
bluſhing; but then ſhe bluſhed again, leſt her paleneſs
ſhould be diſcovered, ſo that there ſeemed a ſweet
contention between the Roſe and the Lily, which
ſhould have the poſſeſſion of her face.</p>
            <p>At length <hi>Pentheus,</hi> like one returned from a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rance,
flung away with ſuch a frowning mourning diſdainful
pale countenance, as if anger, grief, hatred, and death
it ſelf, had all begun to prey upon him, and all ſtrove
which ſhould have the greateſt ſhare. Which poor
<hi>Helena</hi> ſeeing, no longer able to contain, gave a ſigh, as
if that breath had been her laſt, after which the tears
guſhed out, which trickled down her Cheeks, like
Pearls diſſolved, juſt as the bluſhing Roſe, watered
with Heavenly dew, when the ſoft Air gently breaths
upon it, thoſe Cryſtall drops leave their perfumed
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52129:53"/>
dwelling, and diſtill upon the ground; ſo did her tears
blown with ſweet gales of gentle ſighs, leave the
Cryſtalline manſions of her eyes, and deſcend upon
the floor; which ſhe ſtrove againſt with ſo ſweet a
violence, as added ſuch a grace to her ſorrow, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of reſtraining it ſhe conſtrained us to imitate her
ſtormy eyes, ſo that there were ſcarce any preſent,
who were not drawn into ſociety of their tears. But at
length ſwinging out of her Husbands arms, with a
hateful look in a lovely countenance, counting him
the only object of her hatred, and cauſe of all her
miſery, ſhe run to her chamber, and there made this
complaint to her ſelf, which I her Husband ſtealing
after her, over-heard.</p>
            <p>Hard-hearted Father (ſaid ſhe, and well thou maiſt
call me ſo) could a little eſtate bribe your affection ſo,
as not to regard the miſerable eſtate of your poor
Daughter? True it is I derived my being from you, a
bleſſing which I can never requite, but alas, the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of a being cannot countervail the miſery of a
miſerable being, which I have alſo derived from you:
for better never come into this miſerable world, than
come into ſuch a world of miſery, as I am now invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in, ſo that my Heart, Head, Eyes and Tongue are
too barren of Sighs, Thoughts, Tears and Words,
to expreſs my unexpreſſible grief; come all you foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
fill my head with Springs of Tears, and all you
Clouds diſſolve in ſhoures, and come and inhabit my
eyes, that ſo theſe thirſty Eyes which before quaffed in
ſuch draughts of Love, may now be puniſhed for their
ſweet intemperance, and ſatiated with over-flowing
ſtreams of briny tears, or rather that this ſinking ſoul
of mine might be ſwallowed up in a deluge of ſurging
griefs. Ah hateful <hi>Trebonius,</hi> from thee flows all
my miſery, oh that my eyes had been masked with
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52129:53"/>
an eternal night, when firſt they beheld thy loathed
face, or that my marriage bed had been my grave, and
inſtead of my <hi>Epithalamum,</hi> that they had warbled
out my <hi>Epicaedium;</hi> then might my touring ſoul,
whilſt they were chanting forth their dolefull tones
here below, have bore a part among the Angelical
Hierarchy, and there unskreen thoſe awful ſecrets,
which are only reſerved for the eyes of purified ſouls,
where no woes dare crave for entrance, but all joys
injoyed in their full perfection. Ah my dear <hi>Pentheus,</hi>
little thinkſt thou what a faithful lover thy poor <hi>Helena</hi>
is to thee, and what a killing thought it is to me to
think that my fooliſh, but neceſſitated levity, ſhould
occaſion thee to harbour any hard thoughts of me,
the very thought is able to put me beyond all think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Oh my ſweet guardian Angel (if any ſuch be
allotted to my protection, which ſure if there were, all
theſe miſeries would not befall me) I ſay, if any ſuch
I have, prepare thy wings, haſte quickly, fly to my <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus,</hi>
and tell him that he is more dear to <hi>Helena<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi>
than ever, and that a forced marriage hath only chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
her State, not her, and though another to her
endleſs grief enjoyed her Body, yet none her Heart,
which ſhe hath kept intire for him, and that her chaſt
unſtained ſoul, hath not embraced a thought or deſire,
that hath thought of or deſired any other but him.
But why do I fondly bemoan my ſelf to theſe ſenſeleſs
walls, haſte I will to him, without whom to Live, were
worſe than Death, and with whom to Dye, is better
than Life. And therewithall ſhe ran out of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and ran down ſtayres, but her ſpeed was ſtopt by
an affrightful meſſenger, that lookt like one ariſen
from the dead, to bring news from thoſe dark Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and as one that regarded not, or indeed knew,
neither what nor to whom he ſpake, in a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52129:54"/>
tone, belched out by parcels the death of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Helena,</hi> whoſe former griefs had carried her to ſuch
an exceſſive raging, that they had tranſported her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
her ſelf, ſo that at firſt ſhe minded not what the
meſſenger ſpake, but <hi>Trebonius</hi> and I who ſtill follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her, he jealous of her, and I, what would be the iſſue,
demanded of the man the manner of it; He like one
newly awak'd from a terrible dream, who looks about to
ſee whether his paſt thoughts were realities, or only the
productions of his fancy, muſtering up his ſences, and
collecting his thoughts, told us, that paſſing by, it was his
fortune to come juſt as <hi>Pentheus</hi> was ſpeaking his laſt
words, ſome of which, as well as his confuſed memory
could retain, he ſaid were theſe, Oh <hi>Helena,</hi> how
willingly would I reſign my life, might my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
but lye intombed in thy ſweet thoughts, where
thy dayly meditations of me would be better than em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balming
ſpices; would Heaven grant me ſuch a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
I ſhould then count the divorce between my
ſoul and body, the ſweeteſt marriage to the greateſt
happineſs. How ſoon would I build my Funeral
Pile of woes and miſeries, and enkindle them with
the flames of Love, and therein conſume my ſelf to
Aſhes, might thoſe Aſhes be kept as a relique of one
of Loves Martyrs, within the Urn of thy breaſt.
Well may I call thy Heart, a glaſſy Urine, ſeeing I
have found it both brittle and tranſparent. But ah!
what woman is not ſo? ſhe muſt have degenerated
from her Feminine nature, or have been ſome third ſex,
had ſhe been endued with a faithful conſtancy; for
Woman ſhe could not be, and Man ſhe was not;
Oh what a thing were Woman, ſhould her viſage al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with her mind, and her external form ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
conſtant figurations from that inconſtant mould!
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52129:54"/>
ſhe would be twenty ſeveral women in a moment.
Never was any <hi>Chamelion</hi> or <hi>Proteus</hi> more ſubject to
various mutabilities. But why do I blame the whole
Sex for the unfaithfulneſs of one, and why do I blame
her for my own unworthineſs? ah it was not her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy
to me, but my inconſtancy to any thing of
worth, that made her hate me. I that was the reaſon,
I am not worthy of her; of her? no, not to live.
Then once more I bid farewell to all my hopes, fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
all falſe deluding pleaſures, painted woes, ſugred
lyes, and farewell <hi>Helena,</hi> the ſum of all; thou haſt
already peirced my heart with a wound more deep
though not ſo deadly as this; with that I ran in, but
ere my trembling feet could convey me to him, his
bloudy knife had made paſſage for his ſoul to fly from
her claiy priſon. My daughter who had by this time
ſo far come to her ſenſes, as ſenſibly to underſtand
the ſequel of the ſtory; no ſooner heard it, but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with the raging agony of a furious paſſion,
ran up ſtairs, whom ſtill we carefully purſued; but ah!
my tongue falters, and my heart fails to ſpeak the reſt,
and then the tears began to glide down his Cheeks in
ſuch a liberal manner, that <hi>Periander</hi> could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to incorporate his with them, but intreating him
to proceed, he thus went on. Ah ſaid he, the reſt
is ſo tragical, that it cannot be heard or related with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a fractured heart; for we could not follow her
ſo faſt as ſhe followed death, neither did we overtake
her, ere ſhe had overtaken it; for ſeeing her ſelf purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and no other way to bereave her ſelf of life, ſhe
leapt out of the window; which <hi>Trebonius</hi> ſeeing, as
one already carried out of himſelf with horror, deſpair,
and amazement, knowing himſelf to be the cauſe of
all theſe bloudy Tragedies, to appeaſe their Ghoſts,
which otherwiſe he thought might continually attend
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52129:55"/>
him with affrighting repreſentations in this world, he
would attend them in the other, and thereupon leapt
after her; ſo that as if Fortune had ſtudied how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
her uttermoſt power in making me miſerable in
one moment, I was deprived of Son and Daughter,
Joy and Comforts all at once, ſo that hopeleſs of
ever ſuperviving ſuch extremity of miſeries, I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to ſpend the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>idue of my few days in preparing
for death, which my age now begins to ſummon to.
Scarce had he concluded his lamentable relation of a
more lamentable ſtory, but a panting meſſenger came
running with ſuch haſte, as if his ambitious legs unſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of their burthen, had contended which ſhould be
eſteemed the ſwifteſt, or attain the period of their
journy the ſooneſt. His meſſage was to require
<hi>Geryon</hi> from the King with ſpeed to haſte to Court; who
accordingly aroſe, and accompanied with <hi>Periander,</hi>
preſently walked thither, where the firſt ſpecies that
did greet his eyes was the King and his Daughter
<hi>Helena,</hi> with their hands intermixed, coming to meet
him; no ſooner had his eyes beheld her, but as if they
had retained their viſive power only for ſuch a ſight,
and now ſatiated with that, reſolved for ever to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude

no leſs dutiful affection to him dead, than living,
after many vain endeavours to recall his revolted ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52129:55"/>
cauſed his funerals to be ſolemnized with as much
ſtate, as his quality required and her ability could
perform. Fortune who had hitherto filled the eyes
and ears of all men, with nothing but diſmal Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
was now minded to play a wanton reak, and as
ſated with ſo much bloud, for its better digeſtion
brought in this Comical adventure amongſt them.</p>
            <p>It happened that one evening as they newly conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
their Supper, a meſſenger came, and privately
whiſpered in <hi>Helena</hi>'s ear, telling her that an ancient

invite him in. He drawing neer, after humble obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance
made to the King, and the reſt there preſent,
directed his ſpeech to the Lady <hi>Helena</hi> in this ſort.</p>
            <p>Madam, ſaid he, it was my fortune to be preſent at

               </gap>lf?)
who bequeathed his laſt gaſp into my mouth, which
as well as I could underſtand, breathed out theſe words.
Go tell dear <hi>Helena,</hi> ſaid he, (and dear may I well call
her, ſince ſhe hath coſt me my life) that here I dye, a
mirror of Love and Faithfulneſs, and a true pattern of a
faithful Lover. And moreover commanded me to beg
of you, that if any ſparks of love or mercy to him yet
remained, and conjure you by the former teſtimonys
of affection, and the ſweet remembrance of your more
ſweet embracings, you would for your own ſake, if not
for his (for otherwiſe his unquiet Ghoſt would never
reſt appeaſed) entertain my Son as your ſervant, whilſt
<hi>Trebonius</hi> remains alive, and after as your husband,
that ſo the reſemblance that he bears of him, may be a

he, I have performed the Will of the dead on my
part, the reſidue of obedience only remains on yours.

of which I cannot but promiſe my ſelf performance;
for ſure ſo much cruelty and unfaithfulneſs as to deny,

hath adorned your face withall. And then he ſtopt,
earneſtly waiting <hi>Helena</hi>'s anſwer, who firſt making
many ſighs and tears a prologue to her diſcourſe, made
this Reply. Sir, ſaid ſhe, I call heaven to witneſs to
my faithfulneſs and conſtancy, whoſe All-ſurveying
Eye ſees into the moſt abſtruſe retirements of the Soul,
and knoweth all its moſt ſecret productions, to whom I
dare appear. Surely, had I been faithleſs to ſuch a one,
had the whole worlds contracted powers, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Barricado me againſt heavens vengeance, all their
united force had been but as paper bulwarks. My
ſpotleſs innocency is the only Brazen Wall, that can
protect me from its Cannon ſhot, which I humbly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune

Clouds might diſcharge againſt this breaſt, if there be
any other than truth and faithfulneſs in me toward my

are unneceſſary; he whoſe diſtruſtful breaſt, dares lodge
an unbelieving thought of what comes from ſo ſweet a

            <p>It is my confidence of your perſeverence, that
makes me perſevere in confidence, to urge his dying
requeſt, than the conceſſion of which, there can be
no greater manifeſtation of your love and conſtancy;
but the refuſal would not onely by actions contradict
your words, but oppoſe that which Fate and Nature
ſeem to conjoyn their powers, and combine together

to accompliſh; the former, by removing away your
husband <hi>Trebonius,</hi> the only Remora, and the latter
by beſtowing ſuch a reſemblance of <hi>Pentheus</hi> on my

not eaſily be convinced, that it is any other than he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.

And whatever ſimilitude your Son may have of

            <p>Then (ſaid he) ſince you will have none but him,

that hard it was by all Arguments for him to eradicate
the belief of it thence, but ſhe ſtood rather as if ſhe

telling her the truth, how that when he went
away from her, he was ſo tranſported with the rage of
a paſſionate madneſs, that he reſolved to kill himſelf,
and therefore fled into the next Wood, where meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

into his breaſts, but his good fate more careful of him,
than he of himſelf, fenced ſo well for him, as broke
both his thruſt, and his weapon, by glancing it on a

to his ears, and every circumſtance of it, how ſhe leapt
out of the window, and her Husband <hi>Trebonius</hi> after
her; how her fall brake his heart, but his, his neck,
and how ſhe had onely bruiſed her fair limbs, and the
breath for a while expelled out of her body, but that
loath ſo ſoon to be turned out of its ſweet Tenement,
reſolved ſtill to continue, and bleſs the world with the
injoyment of ſo much excellency. This news (he
ſaid) was a greater Cordial and reſtorative to him, than
all the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> and <hi>Paracelſians</hi> in the world were able
to compoſe, and he that before was ſo deſirous of
death, was now as eager of life, and had rather he had
a thouſand lives to regain, that he might ſpend them all
in the fruition of <hi>Helena</hi>'s ſweet ſociety; ſo that now
willingly accepting, whatſoever might reſtore him, he
was in a ſhort time, by the diligence and care of the
Chirurgeons, perfectly cured, and reſolving to make a

a reward that would tranſcend an Angels merits, much
more my poor deſerts, which if I have any thing mine,
that can arrogate this title, it is but the reflection of
yours. If I have any worth in me (anſwered the

met with many ſtrange adventures, at length they came
to <hi>Tempe,</hi> a place not undeſervedly renowned for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
It ſeemed as if the whole worlds delights had
been there Epitomized, and contracted into a leſſer
volume, but more excellent Character. There were
delicious fragrant Gardens, enamelled with odoriſerous
flowers, large and invious Woods, whoſe ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſwept the Chambers of the Air, and ſeemed to dance
to the harmonious retortings of the reverberating Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choe's;
delightful Groves, within whoſe embracing
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52129:58"/>
boughs dwell the winged Muſicians of the Air, chant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth their Love Sonnets in Care-charming accents;
walks of love beſtrewed with Roſes and Lilies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed
with the ſweet drops ſpouted from Cryſtall
Fountaines; freſh purling rivulets, whoſe delightful
ſtreams tuned their agreeing murmurs to the ſoft whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of the wagging leaves, frizled by <hi>Zephyrus</hi> wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
wings, the ſpreading boughs caſting ſuch pleaſing
ſhades on the ſmiling ground, like the ſhadowy ſtrokes
in a picture, made it more florid and delightſome;
the trembling leaves moved by the freſh breathings of
the healthful Air, dancing to the harmonious curlings
of the Azure ſtreams, with ſuch peaceful pleaſure, as
would have forced a Stoick to have indulged his moſt
obdurate mind to loves melting paſſions. And all this
ſurrounded partly with lofty mountains, whoſe high
towring tops ſeemed to ſcale the Clouds, as ambitious
both to behold and embrace theſe rare delights, and
partly with little hills of meaner aſcent, whereon there
blew the moſt pure refined guſts of clarified Air. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Palaces here were, for the nobles and Knights of
<hi>Theſſalia,</hi> but in the centre of all ſtood the Kings, a
moſt magnificent ſtructure, the Walls of Porphiry,
rough-caſt with ſhining Carbuncles, and other preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſtones, caſt in deviſes, Scutcheons, and Emblems,
incloſed with a Quadrangle-platform of Jaſper, made
level with battlements. At each corner, a ſumptuous
convent, wherein was a ſtately Temple dedicated to
<hi>Venus, Diana,</hi> and <hi>Pallas,</hi> ſignifying the three chief fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine
Excellencies, Chaſtity, Wiſdom, and Beauty.
Within, were Magazines of Arms, Wardrobes, rich
edifices, for the Kings Attendants, beſides many
Groves of Cypreſs and Cedar, goodly Gardens and
Fountains encompaſſed with Balliſters of Copper, and
fair Arches, ſupported with Brazen Pillars.</p>

               <hi>Danpion</hi> and <hi>Periander,</hi> that they might the better
view theſe gliſtering buildings, and the other raviſhing
delights, that the place did abound withall, went up
a little hill, on whoſe brow, they beheld in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
a pleaſant Vale, with a more pleaſant Garden. In
the midſt of which there was a Bath, ſurrounded with a
Wall of Jet, and over head to defend it from the Suns
peircing rays, an Arched Roof, ſupported by Statues,
ſtanding upon gilded Columnes, each Statue holding in
her hand a ſilver Rod, on which hung Curtaines of
white Damask, fringed with green Silk and Gold; one
of which being drawn, <hi>Pandion</hi> eſpied a moſt lovely
Lady, reſting her ſoft Limbs in a Chair of Jet, made
at the Baſis of a Pillar, Combing her golden Treſſes,
newly come out of the Bath, ſo that the Silver drops,
as it were grown ponderous, with over-burdening grief,
that there nature ſhould compell them to leave the
poſſeſſion of ſo much perfection, fell in Tears from her
Snow-white Limbs. Each part was enſhrined in ſo
much excellency, that <hi>Pandion</hi> felt his heart arreſted
with ſtrange paſſions, ſo that he could not reſtrain his
eyes from ſurveying her rapting features, and the more
he gazed the more he deſired to gaze, and the more
admirable ſhe ſeemed.</p>
            <p>Her eyes like two Lucent Stars, ſhining with ſuch a
tranſporting influence, as <hi>Pandion</hi> grew an Aſtrologian,
and his eyes Star-gazers, fixedly obſerving the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of theſe two wandring Planets, whoſe every Beam
darted a living death. Her arched brows, where ſat a
mild ſweet Majeſty, ſeemed like two bows of love,
ſtrung with his heart ſtrings. Her eye-lids like Ivory
covers to two Cabinets, filled with Diamonds, at their
opening a thouſand ſparkling Gemms would ſhine with
a radiant fulgor, and at their cloſing, as many would
be eclipſed. Each cheek ſeemed a Roſie Paradiſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52129:59"/>
with Lilies. Her lips like ſhreds of Vermili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Sattin, incloſed two poliſht rows of Ivory teeth,
from whence ſuch ſweet perſuming fumes ſteamed
forth, as the very Air, when ſhe drew her breath, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to preſs with delight into her delicate mouth. Her
noſe, chin and neck were of ſo pure a whiteneſs, as
the Lilies lookt pale with grief to ſee themſelves ſo far
excelled. Her breaſts were like two Ivory Caskes of
Nectar, from whence leads a milky way to <hi>Cupids</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.
Her lovely hair, which the wanton wind ſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
toſſed to and fro, one while from her, that it
might the more freely kiſs her Snowy skin, then twiſt
it in intricate Curles, and then divide it, now take a
Treſs, and fan her face, and then a golden thread, and
dally with her eye, ſo that it ſeemed to weave a Net to
entangle <hi>Pandions</hi> heart, whiles her Lily hand endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to repreſs thoſe laſcivious exorbitancies with a
ſilver Combe, ſo that <hi>Pandion</hi> was in doubt, which
was the more happy, her hair to be methodized by ſo
ſweet a hand, or her hand to handle ſuch excellent
hair, ſo ſweet both by Art and Nature, as would make
one wiſh for <hi>Mars</hi> his fortune, to be enſnared in a <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi>
Net, were it made of ſuch Heavenly Wire. Her
leggs like two Columnes of Alabaſter, or <hi>Atlaſſes,</hi>
which ſupported this little world of Excellency. <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dion</hi>
whoſe ſight was reſiſted by nothing, but his avari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious

with thoſe ſweet treaſures, had the flames of affection
ſo augmented with admiration and delight, that loath

untill they came on the top of the hill, whence they
beheld in a great Plain beſet with many rankes of Trees,
a fair houſe, bordering on a River, whither with ſpeed
they rode. The houſe was built of fair Free-ſtone, both
ſtrong and delightfully ſeated, that ſhewed a kind of

both to profit and pleaſure; where having entred in a

Ariſtocracy, which neither derogates from the Royal

Soveraign remedy to heal all differentes, the Lady
<hi>Amphigenia</hi> being in all reſpects ſo incomparably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
that none but would eſteem themſelves gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
to exchange a Kingdom for the poſſeſſion of her;
Her eyes containing more precious Gems, than ever
yet adorned a Princes Diadem; her fingers Scepters
for the God of Love, ſuch as all Kingly Scepters
muſt do homage to. If your eyes ever were bleſt
with the ſight of her, I am ſure you would ſay, that
none but would refuſe a Crown, to be Crowned with
her Love, much leſs would any reject ſuch a Paragon,
laden not only with all Heavenly perfections, but with
Earthly Crowns and Scepters, having one Kingdom
in preſent poſſeſſion, and another in reverſion, and
all to purchaſe <hi>Pandions</hi> conſent to his own happineſs,
which notwithſtanding he more blind than the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
that doth attend him ſees not, but proceeds in
his warlike preparations, and reſolves to have all or
none, whether it be evil Counſellours that inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately
ſtimulate him to theſe raſh proceedings, or
what the reaſon is, ſome conjecture, few know, and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52129:61"/>
moſt admire. But however theſe two things are known
to be the main obſtructers of our peace, the one is,
<hi>Pandion</hi> hath long been in love with a Nun, who by
reaſon of her indiſpenſable vow, cannot conſent to his
deſires, ſo that he is reſolved not to purchaſe a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
with the loſs of his Love, which he conceives he
can obtain by force. The other is, the Lady <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genia</hi>
hath ſuch a perfect Antipathy againſt all men,
(but her Father, which nature forbids, leſt it ſhould
contradict it ſelf,) that ſhe abho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s the ſight of any,
and will not endure to hear of marriage, though upon
the moſt advantagious and honourable terms, and with
the moſt excellent and abſolutely compleat perſon
the whole world could afford. And her Father
<hi>Hiarbas,</hi> taking exceeding joy and delight in her, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
her the only prop and ſtaff of his age, hath
granted her this requeſt, that as ſhe hath vowed, that
if ever ſhe become an Amoriſt, and place her affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon any perſon, ſhe will never joyn her ſelf in
marriage without her Fathers conſent, ſo neither ſhall
he injoyn her marriage with any without hers. And
moreover hath obtained this, that none ſhall ſo much
as make ſute to her, or once behold her, without their
mutual conſent; And who ſhould dare ignorantly or
otherwiſe to caſt an intruding look into that Bath
and Garden whither ſhe frequently reſorts to ſport
her ſelf with her Female companions, forfeit no leſs
than their eyes for their ſaw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y preſumption. And that
was the reaſon that I beckned to you to come away
with ſpeed, not daring ingage my ſelf to run ſo great
a hazard as to go to inform you of your errour, which
otherwiſe civility would have obliged me to, leſt we
ſhould all be enſnated, and then my puniſhment had
been equal, if not exceeding yours. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> five of
<hi>Pandions</hi> Knights were riding over that hill, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52129:62"/>
exceedingly taken with the gallantry of the place,
ſtood awhile to gaze, ignorant what would be the event,
and it happened that at the ſame time King <hi>Hiarbas,</hi>
and his Daughter <hi>Amphigenia</hi> were walking together
in the Garden, and no ſooner eſpied them, but ſent
ſeveral Knights after them, who overtook and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
them, and brought them to the King, to whom
they acknowledged who they were, and humbly cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of him, that ſince their chief crime was ignorance,
and their ſight as precious as their lives, they might
dye like men, by the valiant hands of ſome of his
hardy Knights, who durſt encounter them. Some of
<hi>Hiarbas</hi> Knights being preſent, provoked with ſo bold
a challenge, begged of the King to permit the combat,
who after much perſuaſions granted it; but becauſe
<hi>Pandions</hi> Knights were then unprovided of all accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trements
fit for the duels, and <hi>Hiarbas</hi> Knights ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to take any diſhonourable advantage, the day was
appointed, which will be about three days hence, the
place in an open plain, equally diſtant from <hi>Hiarbas</hi>
palace, and <hi>Pandions</hi> Caſtle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Danpion</hi> hearing this ſtory was ſtruck with ſuch a
maze of diſtracting thoughts, that all the whole ſtrength
of reaſon could hardly curb, deſpairing of ever obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Kingdom, or her whom he prized above it,
and amazed to hear that another had uſurped his name
and power, all which he endeavoured to conceal, as
well as his unbridled paſſions would permit. But both
he and <hi>Periander,</hi> betraying by their looks the thoughts
of their mind, that they were deſirous of ſome private
conference, the Gentleman withdrew and left them
to their deſired privacy, when after ſome diſcourſes
that paſſed betwixt them, they concluded that the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
way to accompliſh their ends, was for the one to
inſinuate himſelf into the Kings favour, the other into
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52129:62"/>
the Impoſtors, that ſo they might be informed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
each other of the moſt private determinations of
them both, and by that means foment new diviſions
in either party, and interrupt any reconcilement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, and ſo in time deſtroy them both; and
then <hi>Danpion</hi> engaged, that if ever he attained to the
Crown, he would raiſe what forces he was able, and
invade <hi>Corinth</hi> for the regaining of <hi>Florinda.</hi> And
(ſaid <hi>Danpion)</hi> the fates themſelves could not have
deviſed a more fit and happy opportunity than this
that now preſents it ſelf, for when the combat is, we
will ſtand at ſuch a diſtance, where unſeen of any, we
may behold which party hath the advantage, and are
moſt probable to prove victorious, and which decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
and ſaid he, if <hi>Hiarbas</hi> Knights are much worſted
then will I come in and defend them, and if I chance
to prove a victor, do you then immediately come and
make a challenge to me, which I'le accept, and after a
few skirmiſhes betwixt us, you may kill my Horſe,
and with ſome other accidents, that our wits refined
in the heat of courage, will be then pregnant to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
you may diſarm me and give me my Life. And
the ſame part ſhall you act if <hi>Pandions</hi> Knights are
overcome, by which means we may both be accepted
of, the one by <hi>Hiarbas,</hi> the other by <hi>Pandion. Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
much approved of his witty politick adviſe,
and willingly embraced what <hi>Danpion</hi> had propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>The day being come, whereon <hi>Mars</hi> was to be the
bloudy arbitrator between the two diſcording parties,
<hi>Danpion</hi> and <hi>Periander</hi> having fitly armed themſelves
for their intended enterprize, rode to the place appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
where they found the Tents were pitched, and
two Scaffolds erected on either ſide the liſts, covered
with crimſon velvet, and Chairs of cloth of Gold
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52129:63"/>
within, the one for <hi>Hiarbas,</hi> the other for <hi>Pandion,</hi>
each holding a golden Rod in his hand, and attended
according to agreement, with two hundred armed
Knights.</p>
            <p>Then came Lord <hi>Petronius,</hi> clothed in a robe of
Gold, that by conſent of both was choſen Lord High
Conſtable for that day, and entred the Liſts, before
whom came ſixty Gentlemen and Squires, bearing two
Royal ſwords before him, the one ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eathed, as Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to <hi>Hiarbas,</hi> ſignifying that the power of his ſword
was inveſted with ſoveraign authority; and the other
naked, as <hi>Pandions</hi> Lieutenant, betokening that as he
was unjuſtly ſtripped from his power by the ſword, ſo
he would defend his juſt right, naked, from any falſe
deluding gloſſes, with the ſword.</p>
            <p>After them followed two Heralds clothed with the
Apparel of their Office, and carrying two Coates of
Arms, the one belonging to <hi>Hiarbas,</hi> being his Coat,
quartered with the Arms of the two Kingdoms of <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaly</hi>
and <hi>Caonia,</hi> and the other <hi>Pandions</hi> Arms, quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only with the Arms of <hi>Theſſalia.</hi> After them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
young Pages, in Vermilion Sattin, richly embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
with Gold.</p>
            <p>The Lord Conſtable having ſurrounded the Camp,
and viewed it every where, he cauſed the Kings Heralds
to make this proclamation, in the name of King <hi>Hiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi>
that if Fortune ſhould incline to his adverſe party,
and his Knights ſhould be conquered, he pronounced
freedom for any hardy Knight (excepting thoſe appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to guard his perſon) that out of loyalty to their
King, and to defend his juſt Authority, and to merit
honor, would hazard his perſon againſt the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
to encounter them, at the holding of the Kings
golden Rod, and if he overcame, he ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded,
according to his high merits. The ſame,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52129:63"/>
               <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> was alſo proclamed by <hi>Pandions</hi>
Herald.</p>
            <p>Then entred the Combatants into the Liſts, where
after the ſounding of the Trumpets, and other warlike
noiſes, that were the terrible preludes to a more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
and ill-agreeing Muſick, of breaking of Lances,
claſhing of Armour, neighing of horſes, and reſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of blows that preſently followed. The <hi>Hiarbian</hi>
Knights, as ſcorning that their valour ſhould be tryed
by condemned Rebels, who were rather deſperate than
couragious, gave them ſo fierce a rancounter, as if they
meant at once to ſwallow them up with an over-flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tyde of valour. But this torrent of fury was ſoon
ſtopped by a more violent Cataract of rage from the
<hi>Pandionians,</hi> who fought for their lives, but the other
onely for their honors, ſo that the ſhivered Lances
ſlew in pieces, ſome one way, and ſome another, as if
they had ſled to avoid the madneſs of their guiders.
But the place was ſoon ſupplyed by the mercileſs
ſwords, wherewith they ſo minced each other, ſteeping
their fleſh in one anothers blood, as if each had been
an infernal Cook ſent from Hell, to dreſs a Breakfaſt
for <hi>Pluto.</hi> So that terror it ſelf grew more terrible, by
being dreſſed in a terrible garb. The glittering of
ſwords, the ſhining of gilded Armor, that at firſt
made terror it ſelf delightful, being now totally defiled
and defaced with blood, duſt, wounds, and fractured
bones, incloſed with mangled fleſh, and that again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with broken Armor.</p>
            <p>In fine fortune had long been dubious and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
whom to beſtow the victory on, till at length
<hi>Zethus</hi> and <hi>Alcanor</hi> the two principal <hi>Hiarbian</hi> Knights,
being too confident of their valour, that had rendred
them triumphant, over ſo many victorious Champions,
too frequently ingaged themſelves, in the midſt of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52129:64"/>
their enemies, and never retreated without ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
markes of their Antagoniſts reſolute fury, untill at
laſt their lives ſtreamed out with their blood; which
the other three perceiving, as if with them, they had
loſt their valour and all ſenſe of honor, ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
exceeded both in number and reſolution, they
retyred, endeavoring to ſave their lives, though with
the irreparable loſs of their honor. King <hi>Hiarbas</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
this, waved his golden rod, whereupon came
ſeveral Knights, ruſhing into the Liſts, contending
which ſhould be foremoſt; but <hi>Danpion</hi> watching his
opportunity came in ſooneſt, ſo that by the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Lord High Conſtable, he had the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and the Combat was allotted him, with theſe
conditions, That he was to fight with them ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and not at once, and that if he conquered he
ſhould not be ingaged to incounter with any more than
one freſh Knight, that would undertake to defend
<hi>Pandions</hi> intereſt. Then entering the Liſts, apparell'd
in sky-coloured Armour, where the firmament ſeemed
to be over-caſt with Clouds, excepting in ſome few
places, where the tenuity of the Air would not ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly
reſiſt his rays, and there the Sun was painted to
peep through, and ſteal a view of the Earth, ſo to the
life, that the reflection of the Sun Beams from that
counterfeit Sun delineated in <hi>Pandions</hi> Armor,
made the dazled beholders believe, they ſaw a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

            </p>
            <p>On the Cloud there was engraven this Impreſſa,
<hi>Hope appears.</hi> In his ſhield he had a Cancer. His horſe
was of a coal black, but his furniture all of ſilver Swans,
whoſe gli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tering made it look like Stars at midnight.
The Trumpets being ſounded, <hi>Scodius</hi> came forth, but
in ſuch a bloudy poſture, and ſo deformed with wounds,
that <hi>Danpion</hi> could hardly diſtinguiſh, whether he was
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52129:64"/>
a man or a monſter, but ere they had exchanged many
blows, <hi>Danpion</hi> perceiving himſelf much to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power
him, diſdaining to conquer a conquered man,
referred the victory to his horſe, who enraged with
ſome blows he received, fell into his Career, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-turned
both <hi>Scodius</hi> and his horſe, and with his
hinder food ſtrake the wind out of his body; the
Chirurgions having conveyed him away into his
Tent.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, which was <hi>Gentius,</hi> appeared in the
Liſts, but he having loſt his right eye, <hi>Danpion</hi> had the
better aim at his blind ſide, ſo that having a dexterous
and ſteady hand to direct his horſe, and his horſe as
nimble to obſerve the motions of his hand, he ere <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
was aware, cut off his right hand; ſo that he loſt
both weapon, hand and all, and had alſo loſt his life,
had he not begged it of <hi>Danpions</hi> hand.</p>
            <p>The third that came was <hi>Maſſurius,</hi> who encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<hi>Danpion,</hi> with another manner of violence than
his predeceſſors, his confidence and reſolution being
chiefly augmented by the prophecy of a blind Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
who ſome few days before had told him, that he
ſhould dye by an intemperate ſatisfying of an immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
thirſt, and therefore fearleſs of <hi>Danpions</hi> ſword,
he boldly and fiercely charged him, confiding in that
prediction: but his own raſhneſs ſoon unridled the
meaning, for <hi>Danpion</hi> gave ſuch a wound overthwart
his mouth, from whence ſuch an inundation of blood
ſtreamed down his throat, that having two mouthes,
that ſluce-like exonerated themſelves into that narrow
gullet, ſoon ſatisfied his unſatiable blood-thirſtineſs, by
putting him in a capacity never to thirſt more.</p>
            <p>Then came <hi>Hypenor,</hi> who aſſaulted <hi>Danpion</hi> with
ſuch an impetuous ſtorm of rage, as if he thought all
valour had centred in him, which preſerved by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52129:65"/>
ſuperficies of his Steely Armor, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
him from the deſtructive influence of that traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Planet, whoſe terrible (though beautiful) aſpect,
had ſtruck ſuch a kind of delightful terrifying amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into the ſpectators, and amazing terror into his
enemys; but he ſoon ſound that <hi>Danpions</hi> ſword had
made large Pores in his Armor, through which he had
too frequent recourſe to, and intimacy with his body;
but the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

and courage, but <hi>Hypenor</hi> awarding his blow, it light
upon his horſe, which ſtunned with the ſtrength and
fury of it, ſtumbled and fell upon his rider, ſo that
whereas before, his horſe bore him, he now bears his
horſe, which <hi>Danpion</hi> perceiving alighted, and in a
Martial ſcorn ſtamped with his victorious foot upon
his bruiſed paunch with ſuch a madneſs, that the
blood iſſued out of <hi>Hypernors</hi> mouth, but compleating
his victory, he buryed his dagger in his bowels.</p>
            <p>The fift and laſt was <hi>Machaon,</hi> but he approving
himſelf, rather a Forlorn than a Reſerve, ſeeing ſo many
puiſſant Champions conquered before him, and perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf to faint through want of blood, but more
through want of valour, he came with unbended brows,
and a flattering look to <hi>Danpion,</hi> extending his arm, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to deliver up his Weapon. But <hi>Danpion</hi>
thinking he had contemned his youth, more en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aged
with thoſe glozing looks, than he could be with the
moſt grim threatning and ſtern viſage, the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52129:65"/>
of a <hi>Hercules</hi> could have framed, gave <hi>Machaon</hi>
ſo fierce a blow on his head, that down he fell, ſhaking
his heels, as if he ſpurned at heaven, becauſe it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him no more protection, or as if he ſtrove to
ride in the Air, ſince his horſe proved ſuch an unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſupporter.</p>
            <p>Scarce had <hi>Pandion</hi> given the ſignal, by ſhaking his
golden rod, but <hi>Periander</hi> appeared in the Liſts, his
horſe was of a Cheſtnut colour, on his Baſes and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
was embroidred two gilded Eagles, which
ſpreading their Wings, with every motion, made the
horſe ſeem as if he flew. On his Armour was painted
a waving Sea, which caſt ſuch a reflection, as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
doth, when the Sun in the Meridian views it. On
his ſhield, for his Impreſſa, he had the Fiſh called
<hi>Cantharus.</hi> The word was, <hi>Living conſtant, though
living in unconſtancy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They no ſooner ſaw each other, but they charged
with ſuch a diſſembled fury, as if at the firſt ſhock they
meant no leſs than to ſend each other to the dark infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Regions, when as they meant nothing leſs, for if
they hit, they miſſed of their intents, but if they miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
they hit of their will. And yet with ſuch guileful
Art, caſting a miſt of rage before the ſpectators eys, each
aſſaulting, and retorting with ſuch ſtormy Cuffes, and
counterbuffes, as when they miſt, it was imputed to the
Defenders skill, not the Offenders will. The Lances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
broken, they drew out their ſwords, and with a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited
gallant bravery, encountred each other, but
<hi>Danpion</hi> feigning a faintneſs, which his horſe Capariſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with bloud, and his Armor of the ſame dye, not a
little confirmed, tumbled off his horſe upon the ground,
and with the fall, brake his ſword, which <hi>Periander</hi>
perceiving, pretending to uſe the favour of occaſion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted,
and would have redoubled his blows, but the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52129:66"/>
Lord Conſtable commanded the contrary, affirming,
that it was neither according to the Law of Arms, and
true Chivalry, much leſs to principles of Honor, to
kill a diſarmed man, and one that had diſabled himſelf
with the Conqueſt of ſo many. <hi>Periander</hi> told them,
that they fought not for their own honors, but for the
intereſt of their Princes, and he was aſſured, private
quirks muſt ever veil to publike concernments, and
therefore craved the Combate might be concluded.
The Conſtable Replyed, that his will muſt veil to
his commands, and they had already put a period
to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Periander</hi> in fine, with a ſeeming unperſuableneſs,
was forced to conſent. All being diſmiſt, the two
Champions <hi>Danpion</hi> and <hi>Periander,</hi> that had defended
the differing quarrels with ſuch puiſſant bravery, were
received with all honor and applauſe, into the ſeveral
Campes, eſpecially <hi>Danpion,</hi> who had ſhewed incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
Gallantry in all the Combats, ſo far exceeding the
expectations of any from ſuch a youth, that it was to
admiration of all, ſo that there was none that did not
bear a part in the Conſort of his praiſes, ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
him for his graceful deportment on his horſe,
how faſt, ſteady and ſtreight he ſate, how he made him
perform all his neceſſary motions, with ſuch time-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
skill, as that his hand and the horſe ſeemed to
move both together, as if the horſe and rider had both
willed together, and the ſame, or rather both had the
ſame will. Others for his dextrous management of
his Lance, how the advancing it from his thigh, the
couching it in his reſt, and the letring it ſink down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
ſeemed ſo to be done, as if they could hardly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
whether they were done at all, whilſt their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
not to be done, made the doing more delect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and graceful. Some extolled him for his force and

courage, others for his beauty, which as it rendered
him more delightful, ſo his valour more admirable, that
one that ſeemed more fit for the ſoft Camps of <hi>Venus,</hi>
ſhould be a Scholar of ſo high a Claſſis, in the School
of <hi>Mars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, their diſagreeings in the matter of his praiſe,
made the more agreeable Muſick in the harmony of his
applauſe. Neither was the King a leſs admirer of him,
but vehemently deſired his abode with him, telling, that
his great worth had made him ambitious of having ſuch
a Phoenix to adorn his Court. <hi>Danpion</hi> replyed, that his
Court already abounded with perſons of ſuch incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
worth, that he ſhould be no other ornament to it

And ſince your Majeſty is pleaſed (ſaid he) to term me
a Phoenix, although its not my happineſs to merit it by
any thing elſe, yet it ſhall by this, that my fortunes,
life and honor, ſhall be ready to be ſacrificed, when
the rays of your commands ſhall enkindle, and I
ſhould account ſuch an immolation, as the greateſt fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
the heavens could beſtow, it being the onely way
to conſecrate me to an eternity of honor, among po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity;
Acts of Loyalty to ones Prince, being as em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balming
ſpices, to the names of faithful ſubjects. Oh
that it were my fortune to expire in ſuch a neſt of
ſpices, inflamed by your Royal Mandates. Let this
command (anſwered the King) to remain with me, be
for an exploration of your obedience, which you ſo
highly profeſs. Let me be ſtigmatized with an eternal
brand of infamy (ſaid <hi>Pandion)</hi> if ever I let a command
drop from your mouth in vain.</p>

Thus with theſe, and ſome other expreſſions, was
<hi>Pandions</hi> abode there concluded, and he was led among
them to the Palace.</p>
            <p>And thus did <hi>Danpion</hi> play this firſt Act of that real
enterlude, whoſe Scenes as they had been hitherto
generally mourntul, Fortune dreſſing her ſelf in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
attire, ſo they continued; for during the ſpace of
ſeveral Months, that he remained in the Court, he
never could have opportunity, either to reveal himſelf
to <hi>Amphigenia,</hi> the Miſtris of his heart, the main rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of his continuance there, nor to meet with his
friend <hi>Periander,</hi> at the place appointed, and agreed
betwixt them. Some few groundleſs hopes he flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf withall, was his only ſupport, which daily
encreaſed, as his favour with the King increaſed, which
was alſo every day more and more, ſo that in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
within a ſhort time, his graceful deportments,
unconquerable valour, acute wit, and all beyond his
years, and that which added grace to all, his delicate
beauty, were all as ſo many letters of admiſſion into
the Kings heart; ſo that nothing of moment was done
in Court or Kingdom, without <hi>Danpions</hi> conſent and
advice. All Offices and favors were diſtributed and
diſpenſed by him; no affairs of conſequence in the
State, but he had an influence upon and inſpection in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
A great ſoleciſm in Policy for ſo great a Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
as <hi>Hiarbas</hi> was to commit, for by theſe favors, did
he weave a webb to intangle himſelf to his utter ruine.
Princes had need beware, whom they imbrace in the
boſoms of their affections, much more whom they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
in their Cabinet Counſels. For as the eye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the moſt tender part of the body, will therefore
leaſt endure any injurious uſage, and we are moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to preſerve it; being the directrix of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſo a Princes underſtanding being the eye of a
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52129:68"/>
Kingdom, which ought to be of a Lynceous Sagacity
and acuteneſs in the diſcerning of Counſels and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors,
and be able to peirce not only into the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of their advice, but integrity of their very thoughts
and purpoſes, therefore moſt perillous to have it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by the poyſonings of unfaithful Counſel, which
like falſe Mediums repreſent the ſtate of things, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
poſture than as they are in themſelves, and by
that means their Government is under-min'd, their
honor eclipſed, and a gap made for all innovations.
This <hi>Hiarbas</hi> conſidered not, his judgement being
blinded by his affection, but let all things be ſwayed by
<hi>Danpion,</hi> who notwithſtanding was little ſatisfied with
all, whilſt he was barred all means of obtaining her,
whom he preferred before all. And one Evening as he
walked out, to feed his love-ſtarved heart, with the
ſweet repaſt of his fancy, he heard a voice deliver it
ſelf in ſuch raviſhing Airs, as might have compared
with the Spheres dancing harmony, and drawing neer,
the more to enrich and refine his thoughts, with thoſe
heart-pleaſing ſtrains, with the diſtance interrupted, he
ſaw a Lady playing on a Lute, with accents ſo ſweet
and ſoft, as if each note had been a cloze of Angels
Muſick; the Air with ſuch ſweet vibrations danced af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
her fingers, as if the wind of it ſelf had breathed
Muſical Tones, and drawing near, he heard her ſing
this Song.</p>

Having ended her Song, there aroſe a Knight that
had lain undiſcovered on the ground, and taking the
Lady by the hand, thus proffered to ſalute her, Come
my divided Soul (ſaid he) my ſweeteſt half, let me
fix on thy Roſie Lips, the ſeal of my conſtant affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;

            <p>
               <hi>Danpion</hi> calling to mind, he had heard that voice,
and therefore preſumed he might not he unacquainted

not a little rejoyced, he demanded of him, if that
was not the Lady <hi>Florinda,</hi> which honored him with

grew fondly amorous, and carried me to the Palace,

whole matter, who no ſooner heard it, but her heart
was arreſted with the Tyrant pangs of Jealouſie, in as
great a meaſure as <hi>Octavia;</hi> ſo that between them
both they thus plotted my deſtruction, either to convey

ſtars, whoſe benign rays were as ſo many Bucklets to
protect me from the inſolence of theſe two Furies,
would not permit this horrid contrivement to take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
For one morning when <hi>Octavia</hi> had reſolved to

to go to the King, and impetrate a releaſment from

and thus addreſt my ſelf to him.</p>

Before I could have ended my ſpeech, the King
aroſe, and with a ſmiling countenance took me by the

theſe embraces, and let us mingle our united ſouls

for his private meditations; but with this proviſo,
that the Queen ſhould be conveyed the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               </gap>
bedchamber: But long it was not ere my ignorant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverers
came, and ſuppoſing me to be the Queen,
ſubmiſſively delivered this meſſage.</p>
            <p>Madam (ſaid they) the Kings Majeſty attends your
preſence below, intending to bleſs himſelf with your
company abroad this morning, to alienate thoſe griefs
from his breaſt, which your abſence hath revived.
Many perſwaſions you may conceive were ſuperfluous
to me, who deſired nothing more than this happy
means of releaſment. Therefore thus attended, I
rode abroad in the Kings coach, ſome miles from the
Palace, untill I perceived a place where I thought an
opportunity to eſcape preſented it ſelf: Then I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the coachman to ſet me down, for I told him the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52129:72"/>
time and place ſeemed to invite to contemplation,
and ſo commanding him to wait untill I came, I wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
out; but when I thought my ſelf out of his fight,
I ran to a Town adjacent, whence the next day I went
to range the wide univerſe in ſearch of my dear <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
and hearing of his abode in <hi>Theſſalia,</hi> hither I
fled on the wings of Love, and by the means of ſome
Ladies in the court, who have ſhewed extraordinary
favour to me, I got to be an attendant to the Princeſs
<hi>Amphigenia,</hi> who is ſo male affected to the Male
ſex, that ſhe will not admit any to have a view of
her, not retain any of her Ladies of Honour, whom ſhe
finds in the leaſt degree amorouſly affected; ſo that
now I am chained with as great a bondage as before,
though not ſo dangerous and diſhonourable. And as
for my happy meeting with the Crown of my joyes
<hi>Periander,</hi> it was this evening, that walking out to
take the freſh air, I heard a Lute, ſo admirably played
on, that methought I felt my very ſoul tuned in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort
with the ſtrings; ſo that nothing would ſatisfie
me till I had reſolved my ſelf who was the Author of
thoſe melodious ſtrains, but ere I had taken many
ſteps, I plainly perceived it to be <hi>Periander,</hi> the ſweet
Saint, to whom I had gone ſo far in Pilgrimage,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Florinda</hi> having finiſht her relation, <hi>Danpion</hi> and
<hi>Periander</hi> informed each other of the ſtate of affairs in
both Factions, how they much debilitated the ſtrength
of both parties, the one by perſwading the King, and
the other the counterfeit <hi>Pandion,</hi> to turn out many,
and frown on moſt of thoſe Lords and commanders,
who were moſt faithful to their truſt, and placing ſuch
of mercenary ſpirits, who muſt be cudgel'd to loyalty
with a ſilver wand, and others, that had revolted through
diſaffection, and the ſecret inſinuations of private
perſons ſet on work by them for that purpoſe; and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52129:73"/>
farther, how that m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ny great perſons on either ſide,
that might prove potent and irremoveable obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to their germinating deſign, that through diſeſteem
they had cauſed to turn from the one ſide, they had
alſo diſobliged them on the other, by repoſing little
or no confidence at all in them, that ſo they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
as Neuters, and finding Incivility from both
parties, they might be affected to neither, and in fine
when their contrivements were come to maturity,
<hi>Pardion</hi> diſcovering himſelf as he intended, theſe
might be the perſons that might defend his intereſt.
And for men of ſervice and action, that ſtill adhered to
their ingagements, and that by their magnanimous
exploits had fixed themſelves in favor paſt all remove,
they endeavoured that as little countenance might be
ſhewed, and reward conferr'd as poſſible, thereby to
ſuffocate theſe Martial ſparks, in thoſe brave loyal
ſpiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, which every blaſt of infamy blown at their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
honour, was ready to increaſe to a flame of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
to conſume the detractors to Aſhes. Then
they agreed on the time and place where they would
meet, to acquaint each other with their Plots and
Counſells, that ſo what the one had adviſed to or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
from, by the others aſſiſtance might take effect,
and both be confirmed and fixed in their Maſters fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p>And laſtly they concluded, that <hi>Florinda</hi> ſhould
yet continue to wait on the Princeſs, who having ſo
great an influence on her Father, by the mediation
of <hi>Florinda,</hi> many things might be done, which <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion</hi>
would be unwilling to appear in. After mutual

               </gap>imonies of great affection, they parted to their

            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:52129:73"/>
               <hi>Danpion</hi> that had conſumed many days in fruitleſs
endeavours to get but a minutes conference with <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phigenia,</hi>
could not during all that time that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in <hi>Hiarbas</hi> Court, by all the ſubtilties his Wit
could invent, once bleſs his eyes with the ſight of her,
but he daily pined in the midſt of exceſs; ſo that his
cuſtom was to withdraw himſelf frequently from all
ſociety, to converſe with his thoughts, accounting
himſelf never more accompanied, than when ſecluded
from all company, entertaining himſelf with ſolilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies
and paſſionate diſcourſes; one while lamenting
his hopeleſs condition, then extolling the beauties of
<hi>Amghigenia;</hi> ſometimes charging himſelf with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
folly, and baſeneſs of ſpirit, that he was not able
to bridle his paſſion. Hath propitious heavens (would
he ſay) profuſely ſhowred down their choiſeſt favours
on me, and ſhall my ingrateful ſoul repine, becauſe it is
their pleaſure to detain <hi>Amphigenia</hi> from me? It may be
the Powers Divine ſent her hither, to triumph over the

that are able to diffect me to inviſible, to indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
Atomes, when with their bounty they have ſo
liberally bribed me? Am I not above expectation ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
riveted in the Kings boſom? Am I not placed

Orbs receive motion from me, as their ſecond move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able?
and all powers dye or vegetate according as they
receive warmth from the Sun-ſhine of my favour?
What can be more ſatisfactory to a lofty ſpirit than Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
and ſhall I lament becauſe the Stars of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phigenia</hi>'s
eyes refuſe to ſhew their luſtre at the high
noon of my proſperity? <hi>Amphigenia</hi> did I ſay? Can I
name that name and not adore it? Could I in a Poetick
rapture admire her tranſcendent beauty, and not be
thought an Idolizer, I would tranſlate my very Soul
into a verſe, that might expreſs the moſt pure Elixar of
my Love, which if I thought ſhe would vouchſafe the
reading, I would diſſolve my heart into a tear, which
black with conſtant griefs might ſerve for Ink to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterize
my mind. With theſe and the like ſpeeches
would he bewail his deſpairing and deſperate affection.
All his hope was in <hi>Florinda,</hi> whom he had prevailed
with to be his Interceſſor to <hi>Amphigenia,</hi> to ſpeak in his
commendation, and to dive into her thoughts, what
ſhe could, and to try whether it were poſſible to root
out that humor in her, ſo antipathetical to the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect,
and inſect her with amorous inclinations, and laſtly
to adviſe him how he might procure a view of her. To all
which he received little ſatisfaction, the laſt excepted;
For <hi>Florinda</hi> had diſcovered a ſecret vault under
ground that conducted to <hi>Amphigenia's</hi> Chamber, this
ſhe informed <hi>Danpion</hi> off, who as <hi>Florinda</hi> had adviſed
him, on an Evening took a Lute, and ſtole to <hi>Amphige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia's</hi>
Chamber, and there behind the hangings thorough
a crevice unſeen, he might diſcern all over the room;
on whoſe Arched top, ſome rare <hi>Apelles</hi> had deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phered
many excellent Hieroglyphicks, deviſes and
Impreſſa's. There was <hi>This<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Cave, where ſhe had hid her ſelf from the Lioneſs,
and beholding her lover <hi>Pyramus</hi> fallen on his ſword,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52129:74"/>
ſhe ſtood as if ſhe was ſtatuized, the Painter having
pourtrayed in her countenance, the paſſions of grief,
grown inſenſibly profound, and confounding admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſo to the life, that the beholder might ſee a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
between them both, and yet a predominancy
of neither. Not far diſtant was <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> kneeling
over a Fountain, beholding his face in the Cryſtall
ſtreams, augmenting them with his tears, and with a
ſweet lovely pining countenance lamenting, that ſuch a
thin tranſparent Wall ſhould part him from his imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
love, whilſt the feigned ſpecies ſo lively reflected
back his ſweetly languiſhing looks, that one could not
tell, which moſt deſired the others embraces, which
moſt lamented and pined for their unhappy ſeparation.
There ſtood the fair <hi>Phrygian</hi> Shepherd giving the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Ball to <hi>Venus,</hi> who receiving it with a pretty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting

revenge and envy diſplay themſelves in <hi>Juno's</hi> counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
but a modeſt bluſh veils <hi>Pallas</hi>'s beauty. There
was <hi>Jupiter</hi> courting <hi>Io,</hi> with a look diſcovering both
a venereous affection, and a fear to be diſcovered by
jealous <hi>Juno,</hi> who was painted to come out of the
Clouds with ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſuch Art, that if you looked on the one ſide, it was as

<hi>Io</hi> meramorphoſed into a Cow, therein imitating <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>

his Concubine into a Heifer, thinking thereby to
hide his ſalacity under a Cows Hide, from his wives
jealouſie. Hard by this ſat <hi>Hercules</hi> in womans attire,
ſpinning at Queen <hi>Omphales</hi> commandment, with a
furious countenance, and a Beard like the Tow on his
Diſtaff; who would have moved a Stoicks ſpleen to
laughter, whilſt the Queen ſits in State, and with a

Majeſtick ſmile beholds him. By theſe in Landskips
was double-topt <hi>Parnaſſus, Atlas</hi>-like ſupporting the
Clouds, on his ſide ſat the Nine Muſes, and <hi>Apollo</hi>
the Preſident of that Virgin Quire; from his top ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
rivulets ſtreamed down. Near that was <hi>Mercury</hi>
like a Shepherds Boy, toying with <hi>Hebe</hi> under a ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Oak. In one part <hi>Ganymede,</hi> carryed by an Eagle
up to the Clouds, and wanton <hi>Jupiter,</hi> looking down
from heaven, with a greedy delight on his fair
Boy, and blaming his winged Embaſſador for his loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering.
In another, was <hi>Phaeton,</hi> thrown among the

tumbling, and Heaven and Earth of a blaze, as if the

forſaking its lofty dwelling, and comming to feed on

His ſiſters bewailing his misfortune, weeping, as if
thoſe flames had exhaled all their moyſture, or as if
with the moyſture of their tears they endeavoured to
quench thoſe flames, are turned into Trees, but ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
their natural forms, as it was difficult to ſay,
whether the drops fell from dewy boughs, or tears from
their eyes. Under a Canopy repreſented like a Cloud,
held up by four winged Angels, whoſe golden plumes
ſpread ſerved for Curtaines, was a rich Bed, covered
with a counterpane of Tiſſue. The Table was ſpread
with Carpets, of Violet Damask, bordered with Gold.
<hi>Amphigenia</hi> was ſet in an Ebony Chair, covered with
purple Velvet, attired in Carnation Sattin, embroid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

               <hi>Amphigenia</hi> that had attended to this Song with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and aſtoniſhment, admiring whence the Muſick
came, for by reaſon of the thickneſs of the hangings,
and largeneſs of the room, the Lutes ſweet Airs were
not ſo cleerly conveyed to her ear: But directing her
ſteps by the ſobbing voice, ſhe came to the hangings,
behind which <hi>Danpion</hi> ſat; where calling for <hi>Florinda,</hi>
demanded of her, if ſhe knew whence thoſe ſtrains
ſhould come. Who replyed, that it muſt be ſome
Angel that was turned inamorate, and fled to her
Chamber, miſtaking it for Loves Paradiſe, for ſure no
mortal dares or can attempt (ſaid ſhe) ſo neer an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
when reſtrained by your Fathers ſpecial prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Danpion</hi> hearing <hi>Amphigenia</hi> make ſuch ſtrict inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
haſted thence, leſt he ſhould be diſcovered; but
now the flames of Love burned with more vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
than before; ſo that the torment had been inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
had it not been fanned and cooled with hope,
which began to breath upon him with ſome gentle
guſts. For having ſuch a paſſage, where undiſcovered
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:52129:77"/>
to any, he might have reſort to her Chamber, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to perſonate ſome Intelligence, till he might
have free admittance to her preſence, which in time he
thought he might be able to effect, by reaſon of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda's</hi>
intimacy with her, who by her inſinuations,
would confirm in <hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s apprehenſions what he
ſhould do, not to be deluſions, but realities. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
the next night after, when he thought the time
of night might invite fair <hi>Amphigenia</hi> to refreſh her ſelf
with ſweet ſlumber, he took his Lute (as before) and
ſoftly ſtole to her Chamber. But as he went, his mind
was filled with diſtracting thoughts, How well (did he
ſay) doth this blind paſſage reſſemble thoſe blinder
paths I thus tread to my happineſs! Theſe dark wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and craggy turnings, that this Vault abounds in,
methinks lightſomly repreſents the inexſucerable diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
and inextricable intricacies, I am forced to
paſs thorough, and muſt be involved in, ere I can ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
at any glimmerings of hope. But my comfort is,
that, as this conducts to an <hi>Elyzium,</hi> ſuch a one, as
the Gods would exchange theirs for, ſuch a one as the
Antick Poets inſpired with a prophetick as well as
Poetick fury did but typifie in their fictions; ſo the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
windings of my unhappy love, when my Cloudy
fortune ſhall unmask her dusky face, will at length
be unwound, and come to a bottom, where they'l
centre in an <hi>Elyzium</hi> of happineſs.</p>
            <p>Being come to the end of the Cave, he perceived
<hi>Amphigenia</hi> faſt aſleep, her Wax Taper burning by
her. As ſhe lay his eyes carved ſuch raviſhing ſweets,
as tranſported with the violence of ſo many Darts, he
thought he had attained the Zenith of his felicity. The
Pillow bleſt with a kiſs from her Cheeks, as pregnant
with delight, ſwelled on either ſide. Her eyes Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed
in ſleeps dark veil, ſhewed lifes triumph in the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:52129:78"/>
Map of death. Her hand contended with the Lawn
for whiteneſs, and being partly covered with it looked
like a Lilly through pureſt Cryſtall. A lock that had
ſtollen from its ſweet priſon, folded in cloudy curls lay
dallying with her breath, ſometimes ſtriving to get a
kiſs, and then repulſed flew back, ſometimes obtaining
its deſired bliſs, and then as rapt with joy, retreats in
wanton caperings. Her body that lay arayed, or rather
diſarayed in a thin Smock, wrought with blew ſilk and
ſilver, obſcured not her skin, but rather made it appear
the lovelier, if lovelier it could be. Her breaſts at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
diſplayed, were of ſo pure a whiteneſs, as if ones
eye through the tranſparent skin, had viewed the milky
treaſures they incloſed. Her Violet veins that ſtreamed
in branched Rivers, ſeemed like Azure paths in a milky
heaven. This confluence of delights, put <hi>Danpion</hi>
beſides himſelf for a while, but recollecting his
thoughts, he took his Lute, and tuning it in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort
with his Soul, in a Love rapture ſang this Song.</p>

            <p>No ſooner were the ſhadows of the miſty Night

the ſleepy Deity diſmiſſed ſweet <hi>Amphigena</hi>'s ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
out of his drowzy priſon, when calling to mind,
what her ears had been entertained withall, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning

was not a viſion; but long ſhe had not revolved theſe
things in her ambiguous thoughts, ere <hi>Florinda</hi> came
into her Chamber, and after ſalutations that paſſed
betwixt them, <hi>Amphigenia</hi> acquainted her with the
whole relation of what ſhe heard, demanding what her
judgement was concerning it, telling her, ſhe was
perſwaded it was a deluſion, for (ſaid ſhe) it conſiſts
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:52129:79"/>
not with Angelical purity to admit of muddy paſſions,
we may as well think a dunghill can ſtain the Sun
beams, becauſe they view it, as that an Angel ſhould be
enamored with humane beauty. Will they whom Nature
hath refined to ſuch a pureneſs, that they ſeem to be
termed ſpirits, in that they are the very ſpirits and quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſential
extracts of heavenly excellencies, will they,
I ſay, delight in ſuch earthly droſs as we are, who are
at beſt but well-complexioned duſt, cemented with a
little moyſture? our Souls, though their inferiours,
could not be blurred with fond contaminating paſſions,
were they not immerſed in fleſh and blood. 'Tis true,
what you ſay, Madam, replyed <hi>Florinda,</hi> but yet the
loud fame of your tranſcendent beauty, which Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choes
from one Kingdom to another, might reſound
thorough heavens hollow Arches, and the ſpiritual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
might draw the Azure Curtain of the sky,
and gaze upon their Makers workmanſhip; and ſome
one of that winged crew, more raviſhed than the reſt,
with his Creators power and wiſdom, in framing ſuch
a compoſition, out of ſuch courſe principles, might
deſcend to bleſs himſelf with a cleerer view of you,
which he ſaw, but imperfectly at ſo great a diſtance. I

heed thy words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and were it not that my conſtant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of thee confirms in me the reality of thy
affection, I ſhould think thy hatred to me, made thee
uſe thoſe adulatory expreſſions to make me conceited
of my ſelf, and thereby to render me ridiculous. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
anſwered <hi>Florinda,</hi> you are above the power of

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:52129:80"/>
and glut his ſenſe with me, as he termed it, muſt he
deflour me? You put too hard a conſtruction on it,
ſaid <hi>Florinda, Danpion</hi> is a perſon of too much honor,

him ſo near gave a ſhriek that ecchoed thorough the
Grove, and ran as faſt as her fair Leggs could carry her,

for the ſawcy wind too immodeſtly ſporting with her

concealed: ſo that ere he was gone, <hi>Florinda</hi> was
come to her reſcue, with ſome other Ladies that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
her, which when he perceived, he ſecretly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed

ſhe began to conclude with her ſelf, that her pretended

This Letter ſhe gave unto one of her principal
Pages, commanding that with all diligence, care, and
celerity, it ſhould be preſented to her Fathers hands.
But now to acquaint you with the raging fury, that
even diſtracted <hi>Danpion,</hi> when <hi>Florinda</hi> told him of
<hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s hatred, and what ſhe had done to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe
her Father againſt him; I had need to dip my
pen in <hi>Neſſus</hi> blood, or infuſe <hi>Alecto</hi>'s poyſon into my
Ink, for never did any one ſo neerly reſemble raving
<hi>Hercules,</hi> when he had put on <hi>Deianira</hi>'s invenomed
Shirt, as he, when he conſidered, not only that now
he was unhappy, but fallen from ſo high a pitch of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
and that through his raſh folly, and that not
onely he had incenſed the Miſtreſs of his heart, but the
Maſter of his life, and by one inconſiderate action at
once cut off all hopes of ever attaining that happineſs
he promiſed himſelf, both in his Throne, and in his
Bed.</p>
            <p>But this tempeſt laſted not long, for though he had
not <hi>Socrates</hi> his compoſure of ſpirit, under all fortunes
to remain the ſame; yet he had ſuch a power over his
Paſſions, as they ſeldom raged beyond ſuppreſſion, or
could claim ſuch a predominancy, but he would make
them ſubmit to his Reaſon, as now appeared. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting
with his thoughts, how he ſhould prevent this
ſtorm, that threatned his ruine, he concluded there
was no way but it muſt inevitably fall upon him, unleſs
<hi>Florinda</hi> would prove his friend, but yet ſeem his
enemy; which ſhe conſenting to, they both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
agreed upon a plot, which we ſhall after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>
            <p>The King, when he had received the Letter, and
read the Contents, Heavens! how did he lift up his
hand and admire, as though he was viewing ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prodigious
Comet in the Air. What an Age is this (ſaid
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52129:84"/>
he) what dares not man attempt? Faithleſs <hi>Danpion!</hi>
is this the requital for my unparallel'd goodneſs to
thee? is this thy gratitude? how am I abuſed through
fond credulity? is it not enough that I have a publike
adverſary, that daily incroaches upon my honor, and
ſeeks to uſurp my Royal Power and Dignity, but I
muſt have a private Pioner to undermine them all? but
no matter, Ile make him know, that Kings have thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolts
to hurl at thoſe that dare to mount the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
of Majeſty, and take the reigns of Soveraignty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their preſumptuous hands, And ſince he dare to
Arouze my anger, he ſhall ſoon find its Lion-like
roarings ſhall awake him, out of his dream of imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
dignity, and then hee'l wiſh his ambitious thoughts
had flown at lower diſtance.</p>
            <p>Thus the King ſtormed for a while, but recovering
himſelf, he began to conſider, that it was not ſafe to
continue his Daughter and family under the command
and inſpection of <hi>Danpion,</hi> that ſought ſo baſely both
to blow up her honor, and his power; and that it was
leſs ſafe, to call him before the Tribunal of publike
Juſtice, his affairs being now in ſuch a diſtracted po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
ready to be beleagured with a potent Army;
and therefore he had more need endeavour union a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
his men, and by that means, to fortifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
againſt his common enemy, than to diminiſh his
ſtrength, by augmenting and fomenting more diviſions,
which he feared would follow, if he ſhould on the
ſudden totally degrade him, and confer his honor on
another.</p>
            <p>And therefore to avoid this <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charybdis,</hi>
he reſolves to couch his reſolutions underneath his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
thoughts, and ſend for <hi>Danpion</hi> from the Palace,
and put him upon ſomething that could not be effected
without the loſs of his honor or life, or both. And
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52129:84"/>
this way he counted the more ſecure, remembring,
that ſuch Court Minions, that like Stars of the greateſt
magnitude, move in ſo high a Sphere, are ſeldom eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and obſcured by the interpoſition of a new Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
but rather by the bright luſtre of the rays of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>
            <p>To proſecute his intents, he ſends for <hi>Danpion,</hi> who
in obedience to his ſummons, marches from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
and as he thought from all his honors, hopes and
preferments, but being of an unconquerable ſpirit,
bears it with as much magnanimity as he was able, and
comes to the Kings Camp; but above and beyond all
his hopes and expectations, the King looks upon him
with a ſmooth brow, and tells him, he had found him
to be a man of an impavid ſpirit, and greedy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown,
and therefore he had ſent for him, to perform
a piece of ſervice, the very attempt whereof would
redound to his great honor, but the execution of it,
would not only crown him with immortal fame, but
be highly advantageous to the Kingdom; <hi>Danpion</hi> ſee-ſuch
an unexpected event, began in his thoughts to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
over this reſult of Fortune, and thus replyed,
Great Sir (ſaid he) I were unworthy of either life, or
honor, ſhould I refuſe, at your commands, to part with
either, ſince to your exceeding munificence I owe
more than both; neither can all I were able to do,
could I accompliſh more than <hi>Hercules,</hi> return ſuch
retributions as might compenſate thoſe tranſcendent
favours, your Royal goodneſs hath been pleaſed to
confer upon me. Therefore were it to ſcale the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and fetch <hi>Atlas</hi> thence, to conquer the Rebels
your enemies, though your valour needs it not, yet
were it your commands, I would do it, or dye in the
attempt.</p>
            <p>Then (ſaid <hi>Hiarbas)</hi> I am informed that <hi>Pandion</hi> hath
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52129:85"/>
an inchanted Standard, whoſe Magical force, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages
all the Subterranean powers, <hi>Pluto's</hi> black Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
on his ſide, that he is invincible, untill ſome va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
Knight, by his ſingle fortitude, takes it from him,
and I know none in my Army or Kingdom, whoſe
great undanted courage would provoke them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
ſuch an enterpriſe, except your ſelf. If that be
all (ſaid <hi>Danpion)</hi> my ſword ſhall ſoon cut the Charm
in ſunder, and ſend the infernal ſpirits themſelves
down to their dark manſions. Whereupon he went
and furniſhed himſelf with Horſe and Armour, and all
things requiſite for his encounter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pandion</hi> being come with his Army in ken of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
draws them up into a Battalia, intending to
fight, which <hi>Hiarbas</hi> having notice of before, by his
Scouts, he draws his men alſo up into a form, and after
a brave Oration, to incourage them to fight, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in perſon marches before them into the field.
Where, as if the very fight of their enemies had been a
Loadſtone to their courage, their Martial ſpirits were
ſo provoked, as that it was difficult for their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
to reſtrain them from making an untimely
onſet.</p>
            <p>The ſignal for the battail being given, there began
ſuch a terrible conflict, as that within a ſhort time,
thouſands lay dead in the place, both ſides main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
their aſſaults with ſuch impetuous rage, as if
the Gyants had been come, to heap mountains of
Carcaſſes, to aſſail heaven, and beſiege the Gods;
nothing but fury reigned in every b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that were thruſt thorough with Lances, would yet
run themſelves farther on to reach their enemies,
and require that morral wound; others, that were juſt
expiring through want of bloud, would yet ſtrive to
bequeath another death as their laſt Legacy to their

enemies; the earth grew of a ſanguine complexion,
being covered with bloud, as if every ſoldier had been
deaths Herald, and had come to emblazon <hi>Mars</hi>'s
Arms, with a Sword Argent, on a Field Gules<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There
was <hi>Panomphaeus</hi> a Commander under <hi>Hiarbas,</hi> that
fought a ſingle combat with <hi>Sabillus,</hi> who after he had
his Breaſt ript open by an unfortunate blow, yet held
his ſides together with one hand, as if he had bee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
buttoning an upper Garment, whilſt he encountred
<hi>Sabillus</hi> with the other, till <hi>Bonoſus</hi> came, and thruſt
his hand into his body, as if he would have pull'd his
Soul out of her dwelling by violence, and tare away his
Vitals.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sabillus</hi> enraged that he had thus ſnatch'd his victory
out of his hands, lifted his Arm, intending to have
cleft <hi>Bonoſus</hi>'s head, but the ſword by an accident fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of his hand, only cut off his Noſe; which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
blow ſo ſtunnied <hi>Bonoſus,</hi> as in an amazed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
looking on one ſide, and the other, to ſee which
way the blow came, as if he would not take the advice
of his eyes, now he had loſt the Moderator that uſed
to interpoſe betwixt them, and in a fury ran forward,
and (as the Proverb hath it) followed his Noſe, and
ere he himſelf, or <hi>Sabillus</hi> were aware, thruſt him
thorough the throat. Here lay ſhivered Lances, and
broken ſwords, and there dead Horſes, and Carcaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of men mangled, as if they had been newly anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mized.</p>
            <p>In one place lay Heads depoſed from their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignties,

               </gap>ing as if they looked for
their Bodies; In another heaps of mutilated Arms,
Hands, and Legs, as if Death had there kept its
Shambles. Long did the fight continue dubious, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
equally ſharing the Laurels, untill at length it
began ſomething to incline to <hi>Hiarbas;</hi> which <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:52129:87"/>
a valiant Warrier and great Commander under
<hi>Pandion</hi> eſpying, rage and contempt ſo burned in his
boſome, that his eyes flamed, as if they had contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the whole Element of fire, and he thundered forth a
roring voice, as if his Lungs had ſucked in the middle
Region of the Air, and with his breath he could blow
away a World, upbraiding the Soldiers for their baſe
puſillanimity, to give ground to ſuch a daſtardly crew
as he conceived his enemies to be, and running into
the mids of <hi>Hiarbas</hi> men, with ſuch a boiſterous mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as if with his ſingle valour he could ſend an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to <hi>Tartarus,</hi> and by his ſtrength could unhinge
the Poles, and ſtop the <hi>primum mobile</hi>'s career, he ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
all that ſtood within the reach of his weapon,
decollating ſome, making them ſhorter by the head,
and diſſecting others, ſome he thruſt thorough with his
Sword, pointing out plainly what death they ſhould
dye, and cleft others skulls, and thus he unmercifully
triumphed over his enemies, till at length Death put
an end to his victory, by a flight of Arrows that, feather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with deſtruction, lighted upon him. And thus was
he ſlain by this winged Army, which otherwiſe would
have ſlain an Army had he lived, and at his Death
haled hundreds of ſouls out of their claiy priſons,
and compelled them to attend him in the other
world.</p>
            <p>His followers provoked by his example, to make
good what he by his valour had gotten, had engaged
themſelves ſo far in the mids of their adverſaries, that
at length they were ſurrounded on all ſides by <hi>Hiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi>
his policy, who had cauſed his men before to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
ſome paces backward for that end. <hi>Danpion</hi> who
had all this while been butcherring of his enemies in
the rear, intending to cut his way thorough them to
come to the Standard-bearer, perceiving ſo great a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:52129:87"/>
breach, and Chaſm (as it were) in his enemies party,
improves the benefit of opportunity, and rides up to
the Standard-bearer, kills him, and in the fight of all
his enemies carries away the Standard, which <hi>Phoedon</hi>
a Commander of Horſe under <hi>Pandion</hi> eſpying, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
with full ſpeed with all the men under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
Others that knew not of this accident, ſeeing
their Standard flying, and ſo great a party fled after,
thought the day was loſt, and time to ſecure themſelves,
and thereupon flung down their weapons, and haſted
after the reſt, with ſuch confuſion, as put them into no
leſs diſorder than themſelves. With that a party of
the <hi>Hiarbian</hi> Horſe, to compleat their victory, purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, and put them ſo to the rout, that they le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t
few to complain of their harſh uſage, and ſome reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Danpion,</hi> who being overtaken, having indeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to keep his prey in deſpight of his adverſaries, that
invironed him, had almoſt reſigned it up, had he not
been relieved by this fortunate chance. In the mean
time thoſe few that were incloſed by the <hi>Hiarbians,</hi>
were ſacrificed to appeaſe the revengful fury of their
enemies.</p>
            <p>The victory being thus obtained, and <hi>Danpion</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to <hi>Hiarbas</hi> hopes and expectations won the
Standard, by this valiant act got ſo much renown,
that he was more admired than before; the general
applauſe of the Army ſo cried him up, that <hi>Hiarbas</hi>
grew more jealous of him than ever, and reſolved if
that which his Daughter had writ was true, to caſt
him out of favour wholly, and put him in an utter inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
to accompliſh any of his high projects. But though
theſe were his ſecret intentions, yet he carried himſelf
with as much external ſerenity towards him as before,
and arriving with great triumph at the palace, after he
had abode there ſome time, he ſecretly inquires
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:52129:88"/>
of his Daughter, whether any one elſe could affirm,
what ſhe had writ, to be truth.</p>
            <p>She told him every circumſtance of it, and how that
<hi>Florinda</hi> was come to her reſcue, before he had fled
from her, and that ſhe preſumed, that ſhe was able to
inform him more diſtinctly of his intentions, than her
ſelf, to whom ſhe was and ever ſhould be an utter
ſtranger.</p>
            <p>With that a Lady was preſently diſpatched as a
meſſenger to <hi>Florinda,</hi> to acquaint her that the King
deſired a few minutes conference with her in <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genias</hi>
Gardens, where he ſtayed expecting her coming.
<hi>Florinda</hi> obeys the ſummons, and accompanies the
meſſenger to the King, who after ſome private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
with her, is exceeding inquiſitive to know of
her whether ſhe could give him any particular infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
about <hi>Danpions</hi> deſign; whether ſhe ever had
dived into his thoughts, and could tell whether he had
any aim at the Soveraignty or not, and many other
queſtions to the ſame effect, he demanded of her.
<hi>Florinda</hi> gives him little or no ſatisfaction to all his
Quae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies, but endeavours to confirm his ſuſpition,
what ſhe could, and inveighs againſt <hi>Danpion</hi> with
more bitterneſs than <hi>Amphigenia,</hi> and at length ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
to the King this Counſel, that ſince they had
no reaſons to convince any man of <hi>Danpions</hi> treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery
and diſloyalty, but what was grounded chiefly on
ſuſpition: if his Majeſty would deign to honour their
advice with his acceptance, ſhe would inform him a
way, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>how he might ranſack his very intrals, and
diſcover all his intentions, and read the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
of his heart. The way ſhe ſaid was this,
that the King would pleaſe to counterfeit himſelf
ſuddenly ſeized upon with a malignant diſtemper, and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52129:88"/>
for a time retire himſelf in his Chamber, and admit
none of his greateſt favourites to wait upon him,
nor viſit him, but only the princeſs his Daughter, and
her ſelf, that ſo there might be no grounds of ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for <hi>Danpion;</hi> and in concluſion to feign himſelf
dead. And then (ſhe ſaid) ſhe queſtioned not but
that ſhe had ſuch an influence upon him, by reaſon
of more than ordinary affection that <hi>Danpion</hi> bare to
her, as in his preſence to make him confeſs to her,
if he had any thoughts tending to <hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
or of diſloyalty to the King.</p>
            <p>This advice was accepted of, both by <hi>Hiarbas</hi> and
<hi>Amphigenia,</hi> and accordingly put in execution; So
that ſuddenly the ears of all were filled with the ſad
news that the King was fallen dangerouſly ſick. The
Courtiers ſwarm like Bees at the King Chamber
door, to perform their Allegiance to him, but
none admitted, amongſt whom <hi>Danpion</hi> was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
viſitant, but as conſtantly as the reſt repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p>In fine, <hi>Danpion</hi> was ſecretly informed that the King
was dead, and that care muſt be taken for eſtabliſhing
his ſucceſſor before his Death ſhould be divulged,
leſt the knowledge of it ſhould cauſe any broils and
tumults in the Kingdom, which it might be apt to
occaſion, there being ſuch ſwarms of diſcontented
perſons, and thoſe that affected novelties and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
though for the worſe. And if he received not
this information for truth, his eyes ſhould convince
him, if he would come to his chamber, for <hi>Amphige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
(they told him) durſt not diſoblige ſuch a potent
perſon as himſelf, who might hazard to interrupt her
ſucceſſion.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being privately buzzed, and whiſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into <hi>Danpions</hi> ears, by ſome that were <hi>Florindas</hi>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:52129:89"/>
engines, he accordingly repairs to the Kings chamber,
where he finds him ſtretched out on a bed of State,
and covered with a Pall of black Velvet, the body
lying in a poſture lively repreſenting Death, and none
but <hi>Florinda</hi> in the room. <hi>Danpion</hi> having contrived all
this before hand, and by the aſſiſtance and fidelity of
<hi>Florinda,</hi> thus far effected it, was not now to ſeek
in the latter part of his plot, but thus begins to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
with <hi>Florinda.</hi> Since Heavens (ſaid he, ſeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
weeping) have thus deprived us of our King, and
me of my Royal Maſter, accounting us unworthy of
him, and him more worthy to inhabit among the
celeſtial dwellers, than ſuch as we are, it is both our
wiſdom and duty, firſt to proclame his Daughter <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phigenia,</hi>
leſt an <hi>interregnum</hi> ſhould occaſion any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections
among this people, prone to rebellion and
diſorder; And then to honour his Memorial, with the
celebration of his Funerals in as great State as may be,
both to teſtify to the World our Loyal affections to
our deceaſed King, and alſo that our Forein and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine
wars have not ſo exhauſted the publick treaſury,
but that we are able to ſupport and maintain the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of our King and Country. Tell not me (my
deareſt) ſaid <hi>Florinda,</hi> of State affairs, they belong not
to our Sex, but if I have found any place in thy Heart,
let me conjure thee by the many vehement proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of affection, to diſcloſe a ſecret to me, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
revealing of which, I ſhall eſteem as a far greater
confirmation of thy loves reality, than ten thouſand
aſſeverations. Prethee be free and ingenuous in thy
expreſſion, and leave not my thoughts a prey to their
own anxiety, to doubt will more torment me than all
thy tongue can utter, Firſt let me dye (ſaid <hi>Danpion)</hi>
before I let a word drop from thy mouth in vain. Then
(ſaid <hi>Florinda)</hi> what was the meaning of your attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:52129:89"/>
to invade <hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s chaſtity in the Grove? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
<hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s chaſtity (ſaid <hi>Danpion)</hi> may I ſink
to the Center of the Earth, if ever ſuch a thought poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
my mind; what Devil breathed this abominable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of me? ſhould I rip up my breaſt, and diſſect my
heart, thou ſhouldſt find nothing but Conſtancy and
Loyalty there, which when it is otherwiſe, may the
powers above tear it out of my body, for a preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
pattern to future Ages. What occaſioned your
being there? (ſaid <hi>Florinda)</hi> were not my eyes ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of her affrightful flight? did I not ſee how a palli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
whiteneſs had uſurped the poſſeſſion of her beauteous
face, and expelled the Roſie redneſs thence? did I not
ſee, how every part of her fair body was ſhook with a
timorous Palſey, juſt as the Aſpen leaves tremble,
when the gentle Air ſoftly breaths upon them? did I
not ſee you in the Grove ſtand benummed with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
or pannick fear, I know not which, as if you
had been Planet-ſtrucken, or ſome unſeen <hi>Nemeſis</hi>
had ſtatuized you, on purpoſe to diſcover that diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
intention of yours, which you would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed?
Prethee then diſcloſe the cauſe of this that I
have ſaid, unboſom thy thoughts to me, how can I
think thou doſt include me in thy heart, when thou
doſt exclude me out of thy moſt retired reſolves? If I
ſhould deny what you ſay (ſaid <hi>Danpion)</hi> it were juſt

me alive in her dark Cavernes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But (ſaid he) the cauſe
of <hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s flight, may ſoon be conjectured by
any that ever heard of her Antipathy towards all of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Sex, for ſhe had no ſooner glanced her eye upon me,
but as if I had been ſome <hi>Demon,</hi> or horrid apparition,
ſhe fled, as though my very looks had infuſed a ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
into her. But I'le a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:52129:90"/>
it was my fond curioſity, that prompted me to take a
view of that Paradiſe, which ſince, I underſtand is
reſerved only for <hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s privacy. So that my
ignorance put me upon that uncivil intruſion which
otherwiſe the torture of a thouſand deaths ſhould not
have compelled me to. But I hope my future fidelity
ſhall crave my remiſſion at <hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s hands, and
confirm my innocence.</p>
            <p>No ſooner had <hi>Danpion</hi> ended his ſpeech, but the
King ſtarted up out of the Bed, at which <hi>Danpion</hi> flew
back, pretendingly amazed, at this ſuddain reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Nay (ſaid the King) let not our ſeeming reſtitution
to life, ſurpriſe thee with a cauſeleſs fear. Our ears
have been auditors of thy expreſſions. This was but
a contrivance to ſearch the truth of that which my ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious
thoughts ſuggeſted to me. We have found
thee truly Loyal, and thou ſhalt find out Royal good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
extended to recompence thy all-deſerving worth.
Thou art now faſter rivetted in our boſom, than before.
<hi>Danpion</hi> hearing this, fell down on his knees, and
humbly begged pardon for his offence, which was no
ſooner craved than gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And thus was he more confirmed in the Kings fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
than before. And now he reſolves to acquaint
<hi>Periander</hi> with his ſucceſs, and adviſe with him, how
he might proceed in his deſign of obtaining the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which he had daily more and more hopes of,
by reaſon the breach between <hi>Hiarbas</hi> and <hi>Pandion</hi> was

one Evening, when as the Sun drawing nee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſecretly ſteals to the Cave, that little Senate-houſe,
where <hi>Periander</hi> and he had agreed to meet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
about their deſigns; and having waited there ſome
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:52129:90"/>

of affection and mutual congratulations, <hi>Danpion</hi>
relates the whole ſtory of his unfortunate love, and
how he had almoſt loſt the Kings favour, and by what
means he regained it, and what poſture <hi>Hiarbas</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

the affections of the people, which the further they are

returning him many thanks for his condancy and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

as if ſhe would have whiſpered ſomething into her own
ear, and gaping as if ſhe would catch the hony tears
that dropt from her eyes, fell down at her Grandams
feet, and was entring into an ill compiled excuſe,
but ſhe was prevented; for the old hag, wanting her
for her crutch, and being on the ſuddain deprived of
her prop, by this humble reverence, fell with her crown
upon <hi>Daphins</hi> back, who riſing on the ſuddain to aſſiſt
her, tumbled her Grandam with her heels over her

threw her bum with ſuch a force upon the door <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſtone, wherewith inſtead of a warming-pan, ſhe uſed
to heat her Grandams bed; ſo that the old woman un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares
clapping her buttocks on it, ſhrivelled them up
like a leathern pouch; but in the night <hi>Daphins</hi> (it
ſeems) was arreſted with a laxative humor, ſo that ſhe
was forced to ariſe and disburthen her ſelf into a great
cloſe-ſtool-pan, that always ſtood under her Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers
bed, and was pretty ſpatious, that ſo it might
contain the excrementitious evacuations of the whole
family. <hi>Daphins</hi> having purged what ſhe could with
conveniency, loath that the old woman ſhould diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
her loathſome beſtiality, ſets the pan on the teſter
of the bed, intending to purifie it the next day, which
for many moneths before, and by its complexion one
might think years, had eſcaped a ſcowring. But ſhe
had not been long gone, and warm in her bed, ere
<hi>Daphins</hi> evil genius maliciouſly awaked her Grandam,
who whether ſhe had taken cold when ſhe lay on the
ground, or through a loving ſympathy with her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I can't tell, but ſhe was afflicted with the ſame
running diſtemper, and making a ſhift to crawl out
of her bed to look for the cloſe-ſtool, it was too cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
hid for her to find, ſo that ſhe raging that her
Daughter had again ſerved her ſo vilely, takes a
crutch, and pounces at the chamber floor for <hi>Daphins</hi>
to come and aſſiſt her, but the Cat unhappily lying
over the bed, ſuddenly awaked, and affrighted with
the noiſe, intending to have leapt away, jumps ful upon
the cloſe-ſtool, and over-turns it, and tumbles it, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:52129:96"/>
all that it contained, upon the poor old womans noddle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Daphins</hi> who had not ſlept all this while, through
fear that <hi>Anus</hi> ſhould awake at this ſad ſummons, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes,
and tremblingly comes down at her call, to ſee
what is the matter; But as ſoon as ſhe ſaw <hi>Anus</hi> with
the pan on her head, and the crutch in her hand, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
at her with might and main, for ſcold ſhe could
not, being querkned with the filthy ordure, ſhe thought
her Grandſire <hi>Battus</hi> had been come home drunk as
he had wont, with his Helmit on his head, and had
been fencing with his quarter ſtaff, ſo that ſhe was
fain to awake <hi>Bion</hi> to hold him, leſt he ſhould wrong
her Grandam; but ſhe was ſoon ſaved that labour,
for ſtealing to <hi>Bions</hi> treſſels, thinking unſeen and out
of any danger of a blow to arouſe him, <hi>Anus</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
perceiving her cunning, thought to have
reacht her ſuch a blow, as ſhould ſufficiently recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
all her abuſes, but it unluckily, as fortune would
have it, alighted on <hi>Bions</hi> panch neer to his midriff,
with ſuch a force, that he was even compelled to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorge
thoſe ſuperfluities of the pan, that at its over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw,
had extravagantly fled into his mouth, being
wide open, as if he was d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>vouring of ſleep by mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls,
and that he had been all this while ſtrugling to
digeſt. <hi>Bion</hi> enraged with this blow, between ſleep
and wake, ariſes, and gets up one of his four tripodes,
and threatens apparent deſtruction to all that came
neer him. And as if <hi>Apollo</hi>-like he had from that tripos
given forth an Oracle, he ſtrikes ſuch a blow on old
<hi>Anus</hi> one tooth, that grew like an Unicorns born out
of her nether gum, that not only deprived her under
chop, and her upper lip of that ornament, but laid her
flat on her back, and made her kick up her heels, and
Hieroglyphically repreſent her husbands fortune, and
doubtleſs had quite ſpoiled her face, had it not been
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:52129:97"/>
well defended and fortified by the cloſe-ſtool-pan.
But not to detain the honourable gueſts <hi>Danpion</hi> and
<hi>Periander</hi> any longer from their ſleep, by the rude rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
and brawlings of this unſeemly crew, this blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
fray was ſoon ended by their mutual interceſſion,
all being of a loving nature, and willing to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled,
every one framing a wiſe Apology, and <hi>Daphins</hi>
having firſt cleanſed her Grandam, and the Pan, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before much of a complexion, as well as ſhe
could, they again betook themſelves to their
reſt.</p>
            <p>Scarce had the early Lark, the winged Herald of the

the bright watchmen of the night to prepare for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
and <hi>Aurora</hi> had opened the vermilion Oriental
gate to make room for <hi>Titans</hi> radiant beams, to ſlide
through the gloomy air, when <hi>Danpion</hi> and <hi>Periander</hi>
weary of their uneaſy pallet, aroſe and left <hi>Daphins</hi>

and her mouth ſlabbering her fingers, as if ſhe had

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:52129:97"/>
about the houſe, ſo that having catcht them they
rode up and down to ſee if there were any other
houſe or hamlet neer adjoyning, where they might be
better accommodated, until they could meet with a
guide, but finding no place elſe thereabouts, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to ride too far, they returned to the houſe,
where by this time the three goodly inhabitants were
all ariſen from their couches, and had prepared a ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
breakfaſt for the ſtrangers, ſo that now they
could have a full view of <hi>Daphins,</hi> whoſe beauty the

               </gap>able night had masked, whom they took the better
notice of, becauſe ſhe was all the cook they had. And
indeed ſhe was an exquiſite piece, and ſo youl'd ſay if
you had ſeen her; and ſo <hi>Anus</hi> her mother, <hi>Moſchus</hi>
her ſuter, and <hi>Bion</hi> her well-wiſher ſaid, and I ſhould
think the verdict of ſuch curious perſons might be
ſomething regarded; but you'l object, that their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were byaſſed with intereſt and affection; ſo
may be yourn is for ought I know. But then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
you further I'le deſcribe her.</p>
            <p>To begin with the crown of her Head, kind Nature
the better to diſcover the pure whiteneſs of the skin,
that covered her thick Scull, had lovingly unthatched
her crown, and peel'd away all the unneceſſary hai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
thereabouts, and leſt her a dainty ſoft ridge of moſs,
that fringed her head round like a garland, ſo that if
you had ſeen her, you would have certainly thought
ſhe had a night cap on, thrumnd with furs. This hair
was ſomething ſhort, leſt it ſhould hide her comly
ſpatious Ears; ſpatious they were, that ſo they might
hear the biggeſt ſounds diſtinctly, which was the reaſon
that ſhe often gave why ſhe had the ſenſe of hearing ſo
admirable, and could diſtinguiſh of ſounds ſo acutely,
for ſhe would ſtand without doors, and if the Dog
threw down the tonges in the kitchen, or the Sow
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:52129:98"/>
overſet the Milk pan in the Dairy, ſhe would tell you
exactly what it was fell down, and never go into the
houſe at all to know, and therefore ſhe would often
wiſely admire, how it was poſſible for little ears to hear
great ſounds, for (ſaid ſhe) how ſhould great ſounds,
get in at little ears? but I think that Objection
might be anſwered by your Naturaliſts, that make it
their buſineſs to pry into Natures abſtruſe and abſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condite
ſecrets, and therefore to their wiſdoms I
leave the diſcuſſion of it, and proceed in my deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Her head was triangular, that being (as <hi>Moſchus</hi>
would often ſay) the beſt and moſt commodious ſhape;
for, ſaid he (for you muſt note he was book learned) a
head of a rotund figure cannot poſſibly be ſo commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to lodge the three Organs of the Soul, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſenſe, phantaſie, and the memory, nor contain
ſo much wit as a three ſquare noddle; for a Globical
head (quoth he learnedly) confuſedly jumbles all the
three together, which is the reaſon that many are
ſo troubled with the Vertigo in their brain, it is becauſe
they are round heads; their conceits endleſly running
in a circle of fancy, having neither rational beginning
nor ending. But now a tripple corner'd noddle hath
three convenient cavities, where the three things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid
may lye diſtinctly and ſeverally undiſturbed,
like Hares on their Forms, or Foxes in their holes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
they are ſtarted and unkennel'd by the barkings of
Reaſon. And further (ſaid he) I'me ſure, its plain, it
cannot contain ſo much wit, for a Globe cannot fill a
triangle, much leſs can that that is contained in it fill
it. For (quoth he) this is an undeniable rule, that
body that can contain both the thing containing and
the thing contained, can much more contain the thing
contained, that can be contained in thing containing.

            <p>Her purple forehead (that colour betokening Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty)
was ſtreaked with lovely wrinkles, which black
with atomes of dirt, that as it were in love with her

            <p>Eye-brows ſhe had none, leſt ſhe ſhould ſrown, and

at which <hi>Cupid</hi> enkindled the Torches of Affection,
and ſet them on fire for her Lovers hearts. Matches
did I ſay? They were not Matches, for the one was
as big again as the other.</p>
            <p>Her right Eye being of a Hazel brown, ſtood peep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of its Den, like a Mouſe catched in a Trap; for

the Sun being in love with her rare beauty, as the
Moon was with <hi>Endymion,</hi> had often all to be—kiſst
her (what had I like to have ſaid, but if I had, I think
you would have believed me, if you had ſeen her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion)
I ſay, he often ſmacked her countenance, and
left the print of his lips behind. Indeed a dainty crop
of hair ſhe had upon her upper lip, which ſome ſaid,
was made for an eye-brow, becauſe ſhe being ſingular
in her other parts, was therein to have been a miracle,
and had her eyes placed under her noſe, that ſhe might
the better ſee the way to her mouth. But <hi>Moſchus</hi>
(whoſe judgement I chiefly follow) replyed, That the
comely latitude of her mouth, made it an eaſie mark
for her fingers, and then, had they been placed there,
a conſtant Flux of Rheum from her noſe had interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their ſight.</p>
            <p>But as for that curious hay-mow on her lip, for ſo I
may properly term it, by reaſon of pretty mops and
mews ſhe uſed to make, would provoke any one to
ſpue out a laughter, and becauſe once in twenty five
hours ſhe uſed to mow it, but if that term will not
pleaſe, then that thorn-hedge on her lip, was but to
fence round the dike, her mouth, to keep her noſe from
treſpaſſing on her chin. But <hi>Moſchus</hi> ſaid, they were
the prickles that grew about the Roſes of her lips. Her
teeth as if afraid they ſhould eat one another, were
ranked in their open order, to give the freer paſſage to
her words. Rankt do I ſay? I that they were, like the
dregs of putrefaction, or the corrupted funk, that

Her neck warpt awry, that made her head ſtand

her other parts, I leave the deſcription of them, to

to a little hill, upon whoſe aſpiring brow, you might

with enamel'd Meadows, ſpread with <hi>Flora</hi>'s Tapeſtry,
and Paſtures for Sheep to graze on, watered with
bubling Springs and murmuring Streams, and all things

Woods and Forreſts, not pervious for any but thoſe
well acquainted with the paſſages, ſo that it ſeemed

            <p>
               <hi>Troilus</hi> and <hi>Theſtylus</hi> (for ſo they now termed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves)
having a while viewed the pretty delightſom
proſpects that the Country preſented to their ſight,
went into the houſe with <hi>Thyrſis,</hi> where there was his
two Daughters <hi>Phyllis</hi> and <hi>Arethuſa,</hi> as buſie as Bees,
running up and down the houſe to fit it againſt their
Father came home. <hi>Phyllis</hi> was a pretty black wench,
of a loving nature, but proud and coy, and though deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of a Husband, yet thought few good enough for
her, but would lift up her noſe, and wag her head with
many a coy nod, as though ſhe lookt higher than ſuch
as they, and tell them, that truly ſhe could live without
a Husband, whatever they thought. <hi>Arethuſa</hi> was
fair and modeſt, and mightily itched for a Husband,
and therefore would caſt many loving ſheeps eyes at
young men that came in; but yet if any came to her,
her fooliſh baſhfulneſs would not let her conſent,
but ſhe would pule them out all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Aſſoon as theſe two ſaw <hi>Troilus</hi> and <hi>Theſtylus</hi> come
in with their Father, obſerving diligently that they
were prettier and more proper men than ordinary, and
hoping they might come as Suters, fell inamoured pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
with them; <hi>Phyllis</hi> ſhe began to feel her heart
tumble up and down in her, and ſhe could not but
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:52129:101"/>
skeu at <hi>Troilus</hi> and wiſh that he was her Husband;
when his lips opened to ſpeak, ſhe imagined they
ſmack'd together, as if they were kiſſing of her, and
if he chanced to look awry, ſhe thought preſently it
was an amorous look at her; and ſhe would make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
occaſions to paſs by, and then ſhe would look more
demurely than ordinary, and skrue her face into a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
that a bit of looking glaſs flatteringly made her
believe was handſom, and dip down many dainty
dops, as though ſomebody had ſtruck her in the hams.
<hi>Arethuſa,</hi> ſhe was taken with <hi>Theſtylus,</hi> and ſhe was
not ſo confident as her ſiſter, but would ſtand behind
the pantry door, and peep through the key hole at him,
and oh! ſhe wiſhed that ſhe could entice him a milk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with her, and ſhe reſolved if ever he came a wooing
to her, that ſhe would pluck up a good heart, and ſay
Yes at firſt word, for by that ugly word No, ſhe had
loſt many a well favoured ſuter, that would have had
her otherwiſe. But hey, the joy there was when their
Father came and told them, that theſe young men
were come to be their Husbands, and bid them be
kind to them; that is a very unneceſſary command,
thought they. <hi>Phyllis</hi> ſhe felt her heart wamble, and
pant, and keep ſuch a ſtir in her, that ſhe could not
reſt in a place, but muſt needs hop up and down the
houſe, and was ready to go to <hi>Troilus</hi> and tell him ſhe
conſented, before ſhe knew whether he would have her
or no. <hi>Arethuſa</hi> was ſo netled, that ſhe flung to and
fro, as if ſhe had a gad ſly in her tail, and both of them
were ſo over joy'd, that neither of them knew what
they did. And thus were the poor wenches ſenſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
rackt out of courſe between the extremes of Joy
and Love.</p>
            <p>Many days <hi>Troilus</hi> and <hi>Theſtylus</hi> here continued to

many flocks of Sheep he would give <hi>Arethuſa,</hi> and what
Meadows and Paſturage he would beſtow upon them,
and thus continually ty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Troilus</hi> had his brother Shepherd, ſince he ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:52129:104"/>
to ſhare with him in the ſame fortune, and almoſt
cut off his arm that it depended only upon a little mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
of fleſh, that kept it from falling to the ground, ſo
that as his tother arm hung without a ſleeve, ſo this
hung like a ſleeve without an arm; but feeling the
ſmart of the blow, and ſeeing the ſad effect of encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
with a champion, he flings away his Bill, and
falls down on his knees, juſt as the other had made
a ſhift to ſcramble upon his knees, and asks forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
laying all the fault on his brother Shepherd, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that he had not come but for him, and calling him
logger-head, and all the ruſtical names that his beetle
brain could invent, for bringing him into ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire.
With that the other fellow inraged, gives
him the lye, and a box on the ear, which was retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him again to the full, with intereſt, ſo that there
had been a combat between theſe one handed men on
their knees, had they not been parted by <hi>Theſtylus:</hi>
who before he would fully pardon them, laid this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
upon them, that to procure their remiſſion for
their uncivil abuſes, they ſhould one of them run to
<hi>Battuſes</hi> houſe, to ſee if he was returned yet, and the
other remain as an hoſtage. They replyed that he had
been at home theſe three days at leaſt. <hi>Troilus</hi> and
<hi>Theſtylus</hi> hearing this, commanded preſently that their
Horſes ſhould be fitted ready for their journey, which
was readily performed, ſo that taking leave of old
<hi>Thyrſis</hi> and returning him thanks for his courteous
hoſpitality towards them (who poor man could not
refrain from weeping, to ſee that he muſt part with
them, and in parting with them, part with all that
felicity he flatteringly promiſed himſelf in them) they
went on their journy towards <hi>Battuſes,</hi> but taking the
Shepherds along with them leſt they ſhould deceive
them. And by the way <hi>Troilus</hi> begins to examine
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:52129:104"/>
the fellow that had ſo rudely affronted him, what was
the reaſon that he came and challenged a ſtranger in
that unmannerly manner as he did? Ah! (ſaid the
Shepherd) Love, Love was the cauſe, you would have
beſtirred your ſelf an you ſhould have loſt your love I
warrant you; Why are you in love (ſaid <hi>Troilus)</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee
tell us how thou cameſt about to be troubled with
that diſtemper, and with whom? Why (ſaid the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd)
one fine Somers-day, as you ſhou'd ha' ſeen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
twenty, I walked out to look birds neſts to and
fro among the hedges and buſhes, but weas me! in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of finding what I ſought, I found what I ſought
not, as well as ſought not what I found; for ſtragling
up and down juſt like a ſtray'd ſheep after my ſport,
I hapned to eſpy in <hi>Thyrſis</hi> Garden, a Buſh made of
Cupids Arrows, where <hi>Venus</hi> Doves had built their
neſts, and poor I, ingrant of loves matters, thinking
cunningly to have catcht them ere they were aware,
as we do other birds, was cunningly caught my ſelf,
with the lime twigs of beauty; ſo that though I now
deſire what I found, yet I found not what I deſired:
and who d'ye think I found? why it was 'eene <hi>Phyllis,</hi>
amiable <hi>Phyllis,</hi> dainty fine <hi>Phyllis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Phyllis</hi> with face fairer than any new waſhed Lamb,
with eyes black as Berry, and lips as red as Coral;
this <hi>Phyllis,</hi> I no ſooner ſaw her, but as if her look;
had bewitched me, I could not for my life reſtrain my
eyes from ſtragling after her, but I muſt be looking at
her, though to my coſt, I found, that every look (me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought)
conveyed a piece of my heart, to her til at length
ſhe monopoliz'd it all to her ſelf, ſo that I minded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but thinking of her, and neglecting my Sheep,
would walk all alone and talk of her, ne're caring what
a murrain became of my flock, for now I my ſelf was
become one of <hi>Cupids</hi> flock, and <hi>Phyllis</hi> eyes were the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:52129:105"/>
ſheephooks wherewith he caught me, her mouth the
Tar-box, and her comforting words the Tar, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he kept me from pining away with the Love-rot;
the pond where he daily waſht my fleece was made of
tears, for indeed when I was by my ſelf, I could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but whine, as oft as I thought of <hi>Phyllis;</hi> and as
he daily waſhed me, ſo he daily fleeced me, that I
was become 'een nothing but skin and bone, that I
looked juſt like a Skillet (as Doctors call a man, after
they have picked his bones) ſo that when I came
amongſt the reſt of my companions, they amazed got
about me like Birds about an Owl, and made jeſts of
me, ſome ſaid, I lookt as I had got the Murrain, and
would rub Tar over my face; others ſaid my bones
lookt like a ſet of keiles, and would toſs their bowles at
me; and indeed I did look moſt piteouſly, for I have
often ſeen my face in a Spring, but for all that, I in the
end obtained <hi>Phyllis</hi>'s love, and was to have been mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to her, juſt as you came to the houſe, but aſſoon
as you came, the caſe was altered, <hi>Phyllis</hi> looks coy
(forſooth) as though I were not good enough for an
husband for her, and ſhe lookt for another-gates hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
than I, and the like. Whereupon (dy' ſee) I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
after you, who and what you were, and whether
you came to marry <hi>Phyllis</hi> or not, and amongſt my
neighbors, at length I heard, that you came to ſteal
away <hi>Thyrſiſſes</hi> daughters privately, and no body know
of it, but the old man, who had conſented, and
brought you to his houſe for that purpoſe, and the
young Maids, be ſure you would not long ſtay for their
good will, for they were ſo much taken with you, it
paſſed, that none of we durſt ſpeak to them, the
Gentlewomen were grown ſo proud, whereupon (dy'
ſee) I was ſo provoked, that I ſhould be ſo diſdained,
and my Fathers eldeſt Son and all, that I reſolved to try
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:52129:105"/>
a touch with you, for I would have you to know, that
though you now were too hard for me, yet I could
make my party good with e're a young man of my
inches, in theſe parts, let him be who he will. And
then the fellow began to puff, and look bigger
than ordnary, and with that ſwelling made an end of
his ſtory.</p>
            <p>But by this time they had gotten to <hi>Battuſſes</hi> houſe,
where (as their fellows had told them) they found him
at home, ſo that having diſmiſſed them they applyed
themſelves to <hi>Battus,</hi> and requeſted him to conduct
them out of this Foreſt, and they would recompenſe
him for his labor. <hi>Battus</hi> willingly conſented, and ſo they
went on their journey, when by that time the Worlds
great Luminary had hid himſelf behind the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and was deſcending to take his reſt on <hi>Thetiſſes</hi>
watry couch, they came to the place where they firſt
met, where having firſt gratified <hi>Battus</hi> for his pains,
the two friends <hi>Danpion</hi> and <hi>Periander</hi> (now no more
<hi>Troilus</hi> and <hi>Theſtylus)</hi> agreed upon time and place,
where again they might have recourſe to inform each
other of the affairs of State, and of the ſtate of affairs
in both parties; and ſo they parted, <hi>Periander</hi> betaking
himſelf to <hi>Pandions</hi> Caſtle, and <hi>Danpion</hi> to the Kings
Court, whither by that time the torches of the night
were enkindled in the heavens, he arrived. But ſcarce
had he alighted off his horſe, ere winged Fame had
carried tidings of it to the ears of moſt, and by reaſon
of his eminency it was not long, before it was known
to all, ſo that the King having notice of it, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
ſends for him to come to his preſence, to give
an account of his abſence, for there wanted not in the
Court, thoſe malitious and yet ambitious ſpirits, that
repining at <hi>Danpions</hi> ſupereminent glories, took all
advantages againſt him, and in particular this of his
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:52129:106"/>
withdrawing from the Court to beget ſuſpitious
thoughts of him in the King, that ſo by degrees they
might bring him to his Occident, whoſe preſence thus
in the Meridian favour, totally obſcured their luſtre,
and in whoſe abſence only their dim Star-light could
appear. And knowing him to be too potent with the
King, and too ſtrongly fixed in his boſom, to remove
by apparent violence, and impetuoſity, they therefore
imitating thoſe that when they cannot take a Fort by
ſtorm, ſeek to undermine it, ſought privately to calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate
and reproach him with treachery an infidelity,
to which this preſent abſence of his ſeemed to add no
ſmall confirmation.</p>
            <p>But all theſe obtrectations proved in the end but like
Dogs barkings at the Moon, who ſlackens her pace ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the more, nor wraps her face in a Cloud never the
ſooner, for all his Cholerick yelpings. So <hi>Danpion</hi>
ſoon obtained his former favour, when he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
the King, that the occaſion of his abſence was
only an accidental loſs of his way, as he rode out on an
Evening for his recreation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Danpion</hi> having continued ſome time in the Court,
ſeeks by all means poſſible to acquaint <hi>Florinda,</hi> that he
was returned, that ſhe might give him intelligence
whether there were any hopes of reconciliation with
<hi>Amphigenia,</hi> and whether all endeavors to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
would be fruitleſs or not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Florinda</hi> having notice by this means that <hi>Danpion</hi>
was come, ſecretly repairs to his Chamber, and there
tells how deſperate averſe the Lady <hi>Amphigenia</hi> yet
continued to all his Sex, and in particular to him, by
reaſon of the laſt affront he offered her (for ſo ſhe
eſteemed it) but yet incourages him to proſecute his
intents, with what prudence and ſecreſie he could, for
ſhe ſaid the proſecution of ſuch a deſign required both
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:52129:106"/>
in the full extent of their natures; and moreover ſhe
promiſed him that wherein her aſſiſtance could be avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
ſhe did oblige her whole power to his ſervice.
<hi>Danpion</hi> returning her infinite thanks for her unimitable
civilities, takes his leave and goeth and ponders by
himſelf, and at length concludes upon a plot, which in
ſhort time he thus puts in execution.</p>
            <p>It was when the black brow'd night triumphing over
the day, ſate ſhaking her dewy locks in her Ebony
throne, having ſpred her rorid Carpet over the ſable
Hemiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Charmes, and huſht the tyred ſenſes to their reſt,
when <hi>Danpion</hi> attended on by his Page, ſecretly ſteals
through the crankling vault, to <hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
whom he finds juſt as the drowſie Deity had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed
her ſenſes, a book in her hand, and her wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
Taper, a Lovers true Hieroglyphick, burning by
her, as if compoſed of Lovers hearts, it had fetcht
flames from her eyes, and with thoſe flames conſumed
it ſelf to aſhes. And perceiving the opportunity fit for
his intended enterprize, he attires his beautiful Boy
like one of heavens ſwift Purſivants, with golden
Wings, which by reaſon of a private Engine, ſo poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
his body in the Air, like <hi>Archytas</hi> Dove, that as
if ſome ſecret ſpirit lurkt in thoſe gilded plumes, he
could convey himſelf whether he pleaſed. About his
fair naked body was girt a ſilken weed, which partly
of a Caerulean-colour, ſweetly intermixed with purple
ſtreaks, ſeemed as if he had been clothed in a piece of
<hi>Aurora's</hi> mantle, and partly of a miſty gloomy colour,
artificially interwoven with Gold, looked as if he had
ſnatcht a Sun-beam, ſheathed in a dewy cloud; that
golden Zone that encompaſſed his middle, looked like
the Zodiack, the Jewels wherewith it was emboſt, like
the Planets, and the rich Carbuncle, that ſerved for a
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:52129:107"/>
button, whoſe nature is to be moſt reſulgent in the
darkeſt night, ſhone with ſo much reſplendency, as in
the midſt of that darkneſs, it moſt lightſomely repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
the Sun. In the one hand, he put a Harp,
and in the other a Letter, which was thus ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.<q>
                  <hi>Venus</hi> Queen of Beauty, to <hi>Amphigenia,</hi> her
Succeſſor.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In this Garb he conveys him into the room, through
a ſecret paſſage, like a trap-door, made in the roof of
the Chamber, that he had carved out for that purpoſe.
The lovely Boy, being thus entred into the room, and
inſtructed in all things, gently moves his Air-dividing
Pineons, and marrying his ſweet quavering voyce, to
the Harpes raviſhing Airs, as he flys, ſings this Song.</p>

Beauty; therefore the powers ſublime have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,

that though in me (ah me!) their protraicture's
defac'd, the tranſcript's ſoiled, the ſoil is ſpoiled, the
Plant is withered, the reflection ſhaded and eclipſed
by deaths malevolent interpoſition; yet that in thee

varniſhed, the ſoil enriched, the Plant tranſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and the reflection with greater luſtre augmented,
and the quinteſſence of that purity which made all
hearts adore me, and gave me a divine ſoveraignty,
and unlimited prerogative, muſt be tranſmigrated into
thee. Then ſince by the univerſal determination and
ſuffrage of the Gods, You muſt ſucceed me in my
dominion, take this advice, as the counſel of a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Queen, and your predeceſſor, Avoid theſe two
extremes.</p>
                  <p>1. Let not your beauty be a pander to venereous
deſires.</p>
                  <p>2. Nor let it raiſe your thoughts to ſo high a pitch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
humane nature, as to diſdain any community in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
to divinity.</p>
                  <p>The conſumption of that heap of rich perfections
once treaſured up in me, ſufficiently teſtifieth the bad
conſequence that attends the former error. For though
my revenews were large, and ſo large, as that they
were not capable of augmentation, without increaſing
to Infinity, both heaven and earth as tributaries, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the choiceſt of their treaſures, and contending
who ſhould moſt enrich the Exchequer of my beauty,
of which I need not trouble you with an Inventory,
ſince in your ſelf you may read the Total ſumm, yet
my too prodigal expence hath made me turn bankrupt,
ſo that now grim death hath arreſted me, and would
convey me into the earths hollow womb, there end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly
to pore upon my miſery, did not fulminating
<hi>Jove</hi> pawn his divinity to Bail me. But what need I
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:52129:109"/>
uſe ſuch expreſſions as theſe, to one whoſe unpolluted
mind was never yet ſtained with an unchaſt thought?
Elſe I might have added, that this counſel is not only
conſonant to Prudence but Policy, for by that means you
may contract an inviolable league with <hi>Diana,</hi> my ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable
enemy, whilſt I reigned, and procure an
union between the two principalities, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
will be a continual peſt each to other. But as for
the latter extreme, what ever you do, avoid that, as a
notorious Soleciſm in policy, and that that will inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
tend to the devaſtation of your Kingdom. For
who do ye think will make your ſacred Altars ſmoke
with incenſe, if you incenſe them with auſtere reryred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and ſupercilious behaviour, which above all
things Lovers hate? If you would have acceſs to your
peoples hearts, and be honored and adored in the moſt
recondite parts of their ſouls, your Throne muſt not be
inacceſſible. You will ſoon find that love-wounded
mortals will diſdain your Ceremonious rites, if you
deny them Hymeneal rights, a fundamental privilege,
which all your ſubjects will claim as their proper inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.</p>
                  <p>Beauty is Natures Ivy-buſh, now, you will be a
Cheat to the world, if you either ſell that thats naught,
or there's nought to ſell. What would my ſubjects
ſay of me, think you, if you ſhould prove a ſuperficial
Queen, having little of the ſubſtance of Royalty, and
they ſhould ſee themſelves compelled to embrace a
miſty reſemblance of ſoveraignty in their affections?
truely there's cauſe to fear, if you ſhould thus ſimulize
<hi>Ixions</hi> Cloud, you'd be forc'd to ſuffer <hi>Ixions</hi> penalty,
endleſly to turn about the Wheel of your Fortune, and
ſpin the thread of your own miſery. To ſhun then both
theſe extremes, and tread upright, verging to neither
ſide, the only Counſel I can give you is this.</p>

was not (ſhe ſaid) to reveal ſo much of his folly; But
if he was ſo ambitious of praiſe, it had been more wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to have had another tongue, and not his own, to
be laviſh in his praiſes, or that if he muſt needs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend

by his actions, than by his words; for ſhe was ſure
the wiſeſt ſort of people would eſteem him, whoſe
name was renowned for brave exploits, was ſounded
forth by the Trumpet of fame, to merit higher ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe,
than he whoſe own tongue babled forth his
own commendations in ſuch an exuberant manner; but
truly (ſaid ſhe) for his actions, thoſe that I have had

moſt of theſe paſſages. But when he was more fully
informed, how ſhe ſuſpected the plot, and with what
diſdain and fury ſhe toſſed the letter to his Page, he
preſently haſts to his Chamber, commands his Boy to

up and down the room, lamenting his condition, and

and anon ſerene, the wave now rough, and anon calm;
ſo who knows how ſoon ſhe may calm and ſmooth
her ſtormy brow, and be of a milder aſpect? it is but
waiting till her gameſome vein ſurprize her, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
her rigid thoughts, and then ſhe will be as toyiſh,
as now ſhe is coy. But ſtay, who is it, that my thoughts
thus malape<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tly preſume to accuſe of levity, coyneſs,
retyredneſs, and what not? is it not <hi>Amphigenia?
Amphigenia,</hi> the model of heaven, the Paragon of
Beauty, the glory of Nature, the worlds ornament,
the pride of <hi>Theſſalia,</hi> and the Miſtreſs of my heart?
<hi>Amphigenia</hi> whoſe peerleſs perfections ſo far tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
the Criticiſm of Owl-ey'd judgement, as that
their dazling luſtre renders them even unapprehenſible,
much more incomprehenſible, and moſt of all uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertible.
Can my dim-ſighted ſoul then think to
diſcern a ſpot in that reſplendent Beauty, whoſe reful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
rays, though ſeen but by reflection in my thoughts,
obſcure its purblind ſight, with a dusky miſt? what if
ſhe be coy, and inexorable to the Petitions of her poor
Love-ſick ſuppliants? it may be ſhe is an Angel clad in
fleſh, and if ſo, her purity debats all thoughts of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
conjunction, but if not, ſhe is a woman clothed
with Angelical Beauty, and that thought ſubverts all
hopes of fruition. Her body though framed by Nature,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:52129:113"/>
of a marvellous Architecture, yet is but a temporary
Cell, where her immaculate Soul, for the freer and
more uninterrupted commerce with heaven, ſeparated
from all converſe may reſide, exchanging ſacred and
ſublime meditations, the moſt pure offerings and
ſweet exhalations of a Chaſt uncontaminated mind, for
divine enthuſiaſms and inſpirations. Shall I then to
purchaſe this tranſitory Cell, ſell my joys, my life, my
reſt, my heart and all? no my immaterial Soul will not
admit of commixture with the moſt refined earth,
and therefore it is not her corporal part alone, though
moulded into an Angelical form, that doth rapt my
heart with a tranſporting affection; but her Soul, her
vertuous Soul, whoſe beams ſhining through her eyes,
as through a Cryſtal medium, reflect round her face,
and exhale my affections; but alas! that's too much
wedded to Virginity, and taken up with the raviſhing
delicacies of Chaſtity, ever to be adulterated and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed
with paſſion, ſo as to parturiate amorous deſires,
the off-ſprings of love-enthralled ſouls. Deſpair then
henceforth ſhall be the ſable hearſe of my diſturbing
thoughts, I'le now compoſe my interior, diſordered
by the jarrings of rebellious paſſions, and make my ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational
part reſign and ſurrender up all her faculties to
the governance and direction of my intellectuals. And
if my diſcourteous Stars have not deſtined me to that
happineſs, to be linked in matrimonial union, with
ſuch a ſuperexcellent Beauty, and to have our hearts
diſſolved into one, with the ardent flames of pure af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
I muſt frame a content, and make my Soul
acquieſce in heavens determination. But if the kind
fates have decreed the contrary, I ſhall with unwearied
patience await, till the happy hour of <hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s
miraculous converſion (Elixar-like) ſhall turn all my
tormenting thoughts, and corroding anxieties into true
bliſs and contentation.</p>

had ſhe eſcaped out of the Nunnery, but a curſed Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
ſnatcht her up, and conveyed her to his Ship, where
he daily ſolicited her to part with her Chaſtity, more
precious to her than her life; but ſhe abhorring the
motion, continually rejected him, ſo that in the end,
that Rebel to Vertue, hells firſt-born, and heir in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriting
its damnable practices, perceiving himſelf to
be ſlighted, and no means to accompliſh his hell-bred
deſires, reſolved to crop the ſweet bud of her Virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

Vertue, which her ſweet ſoul bound for heaven con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained;
and to that end having on a day moſt importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
urged her, with all the intreaties and intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

her devouring jaws, and intomb him alive in her vaſt
womb, as he would not have the Clouds diſtill down
vengeance upon his head, not to make her innocency

            <p>But alas! ſhe (poor Lady) when through the liquid

weak ſtrugling, ſhe muſt part with her Virginity, that
redolent perfume, which had wont to aſcend to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
as the ſweet ſacrifice of her Chaſt mind, how did
ſhe bluſh, and weep, and wring her hands, as if ſhe
would ſqueeze tears from them too, and then look
pale, as if grief had wrapped her beauty in the winding
ſheet of a Snowy paleneſs, being ready to be buried
with her Vertue in the loathſome Grave of his luſt?
and then bluſh again, as aſhamed to think of her ſhame,

a Lawn ſheet caſt over a bed of Roſes. One while the
thoughts of her dying honor, but never-dying reproach,
would dye her Cheeks with a Crimſon tincture, as if
her heart bleeding for her miſery meant to ſend ſome
ſtreams out at the Cryſtal sluces of her eyes, but ah!
they were anticipated by an inundation of tears. And
then the thoughts of her afflicted, forſaken, hopeleſs
condition, the ſad thoughts of her unheard, unpittyed,

thoughts of her woful diſhonor, at length quite chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
her countenance (ſweet countenance, in which

preſently run to the Maſters Cabbin, and force open

them, that in the end they thought her to be ſome
Mermaid, ſo that they were clapping on all the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſs

her, but by that time they had sailed ſome few leagues,

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:52129:121"/>
but rather determined to ſtay, untill ſhe came up with
them, which was in a ſhort time, for by that time they
had put their Sails in the wind, ſhe was come ſo neer
as they might diſcern it to be a ſorrowful Lady, ſitting
(as on horſeback) on a Dolphin, her face, the Index
of a grieved mind, ſeemed to be beauties Coffin, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

breath formed into words, have broken the ſweet pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

Jaylor, would not permit it, but converted them into
groans. At length giving liberty to her tongue to
Midwive the dolours which her heart pregnant with
was in travel withall, ſhe with lamentable demeanor
thus ſpake.</p>
            <p>Ah wo is me, wo is me (ſaid ſhe) but then the tears
interrupted her ſpeech, and her eyes to aſſiſt her fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
voice in ſorrows doleful language, diſcourſt her
griefs, but then tears again as it were ratifyed into
ſighs, and ſighs framed into words, ſhe thus lamented
her condition.</p>
            <p>Ah (ſaid ſhe) little did I ever think that heaven had
thus many plagues in ſtore for me. Never was poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
diſtreſt like me; as though one death were not
enough to kill a poor dying woman, but I muſt daily
be tormented with partial deaths, that methinks tear
my ſoul piece-meal from my body; Oh! ſhew ſome

and pity my ſorrows, as you would ever hope that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

with the terrors of death-threatning calamities, which
how ſoon may be your lot is known only to the great

            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:52129:121"/>
Theſe doleful expreſſions, expreſſed ſo dolefully by a
Lady beleagured with extremity of miſery, would have
ſcrued tears from a Rock, and made an Adamant turn
<hi>Niobe,</hi> but yet took no impreſſion upon the Maſter, but
he rather (like an inhumane Churl) commands them
to ſail away, What (ſaid he) have we nothing to do but
to mind a fooliſh womans babling? let her alone to
prate to the Dolphin, and mind you your employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
But no ſooner had he tacked about to be gone,
but the poor Lady gave a ſhriek would have rent a
heart in ſunder, and cryed out to them as loud as her
feeble voice could utter; Oh! (ſaid ſhe) have your
hearts made a league with cruelty? though your ears
ſhould be deaf to the lamentable crys of a diſtreſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
yet methinks, your eyes might intercede a little
for me with your rocky hearts. Oh that ever ſo much

is vertues attendant, and reſides not where vertue is
exil'd, and vertue is ever exil'd from an obdurate
heart. Oh you powers above, will you give no truce
to my ſorrows? muſt I be quite bereft of all relief?
and then ſhe gave a groan, as if ſhe had torn her vital
ſtrings, and lifting up her eyes and hands, ſhe thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored
Heaven:</p>
            <p>Since it is your will (ſaid ſhe) to drench and pickle
up my ſoul in Briny ſorrows, to preſerve it pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted,
and that the ſtormy guſts of adverſe fortune
muſt drive me through a Sea of Tears, ere I can arrive
at the Haven that ſhall put an end to the turmoiling
Navigation of this life; Oh then (ſaid ſhe) let this

that inconſiderable inſtant that links paſt and future,

it arrive at that bleſt <hi>Elizium,</hi> where one eternal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible

of unconceivable felicity.</p>
            <p>The Fiſher-men hearing theſe woful complaints, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be enraged at the Maſters ſavage cruelty, and in
a mutinous manner, with threatnings compelled him to

from Heaven, ſwimming ſo near the Veſſel, as that
they could caſt a Rope to draw her in; which in the
end they did, the Maſter not daring to oppoſe.</p>
            <p>The Veſſel thus fraught, with more Treaſure than
all the Eaſtern Junks or Caravans, (her Eyes rich Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets
of Diamonds, containing more Gems, and her
Breath more Aromatick Spices, than ever yet adorned
and perfumed the Orient) moved with ſoft and gentle
Gales, thus ſmoothly ſlyded along the Seas Briny ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
for the ſpace of 48 hours; at the end of which,
they arrived at <hi>Cyprus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Maſter, who while he was at Sea, terrified with
the bold threatnings of his men, durſt not vent his
Cruelty towards this poor Lady; yet being at <hi>Cyprus,</hi>
he reſolved to revenge the affronts he received for her
ſake, upon her; and to that end, one night, when he
had after great intreaties, given her his promiſe for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to go aſhore, he unknown to any, ſold her to an
ill-favoured Ruſtick, that had all the marks of Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
almoſt about him; who in a rude manner haled
her aſhore, and that night conveyed her to his Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
ſome miles diſtant from the Sea, intending the
next morning to compleat his felicity by marriage.</p>
            <p>But when <hi>Glycera</hi> ſaw that Heaven had redeemed
her out of a Purgatory of miſery, to fling her into a Hell
of calamities, Oh, with what doleful lamentations did
ſhe (ſad Lady) conſume the night? Now wring her
hands and groan, as if ſhe rang her own Knell; and then
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:52129:122"/>
weep and ſob, as if her Eyes and Lungs, rivalls in Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
had contended which ſhould expreſs moſt to the
life, a killing Paſſion. Sometimes her fainting ſpirits,
as not able to endure the intollerable tyranny of domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering
Grief, would ſeem condenſed into Tears,
which diffuſed through the flood-gates of her Eyes,
would leave her ſurprized with dying languor: but then
her ſenſes reſtored to their natural functions, ſorrow,
with a vigorous impetuouſneſs, would break the damms
of moderation, and like a Torrent for a while reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
return with greater fury. Sometimes ſhe would
begin to importune Heaven for mercy: O thou great
Rector of our Deſtinies (ſaid ſhe) muſt my heart be the
Rendeſvouz, where all miſeries meet? Thou art the
Circumference, from whence theſe black lines of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
ſtream; muſt I be the Centre where they ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate?
Oh let not tyrannizing ſorrow uſurp thy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
over all my Faculties, and ſubject thoſe Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to its Rule, which onely ought to obey thy Divine
Impoſitions: Oh deſtroy not the ſoul which thou haſt

thou didſt propoſe to thy ſelf in my Creation; but ſhew
mercy, if ever ſhew mercy, ſhew mercy to one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſt
in miſery.</p>
            <p>Having ſaid this, ſhe would pauſe a while, as it were
liſtning what Anſwer Heaven would return, and with
ſome faint ſighs, ſeem as it were to parley with Death;
and then a chilly Paleneſs would arreſt her Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
as if Heaven, mindeful of her Petitions, had
hung out their white Flagg of Truce, and diſplayed it
in her face, as a Token of that inviolable League, ſhould
ere long be contracted between her ſoul, and eternal
Bliſs; and that now they were ſending their black Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
Death, to ſign and ſeal the Articles.</p>
            <p>Dear <hi>Danpion</hi> excuſe me, if I am thus Copious in the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:52129:123"/>
relation of this ſad Ladies misfortune; but truly, when
I heard the ſtory firſt related by the Knight (that (as I
told you) lately came from <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and heard her ſelf
relate, what his eyes were not ſpectators of) I could not
but ſilently bequeath ſome drops to the ground; drops
do I ſay? Alas, had I not been in <hi>Pandion</hi>'s preſence,
but where I might have let looſe the reigns to my Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
I could have drowned my ſelf in Tears; for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts
I felt my vey ſoul transformed into ſorrow
it ſelf. But to proceed, thus I ſay, She lamentably
ſpent this lamentable night, in Weeping, Sighing, Sob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing,
Groaning, Praying, till the bright morning had
diſpelled the ſhadowes of the miſty night, and <hi>Aurora</hi>
wrapping up her face in a Vermilion-mantle, ſilently
bewailed her ſorrows in Cryſtal Tears.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Lacon</hi> (for ſo was the Ruſtick named) awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
by his own loud ſnoring, called to mind his new
Bride, and raviſhed with joy, his heart clambring up
into his mouth, almoaſt choaked him with exceſs of
contentment, he ariſes, and in haſte runs to bleſs his
Eyes with the ſight of her Beauty, and ere he or ſhe
was aware, ſtumbles upon her, who had choſen the
darkeſt corner in the Cottage, to lament her miſeries;
and when ſhe ſaw her ſelf thus ſurprized, modeſty ſo
ſweetly apparelled her Face, in a Vermilion veſture, as
that her Cheeks, beſprinkled with Tears, looked like
Roſes impearled with Heavenly dew.</p>
            <p>No ſooner did <hi>Lacon</hi> behold his new Sweet-hearts
ſweet-heart-attracting feature, but her Eyes, that
might vye Stars with Heaven, darted ſuch ſparkling
glances, as ſoon ſet on fire the tinder of his Affections;
ſo that tranſported with the Extaſies of love, he boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſly
ſeizeth on her, and after his rude manner, prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
to fix the Seal of his Affections on her melting
Lips: Come (ſaid he) ſweet Lombe, let me buſs thy
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:52129:123"/>
Honny-combe Lips, and with that, by force he ſmackt
her, as if he was ſucking the ſweet contained in thoſe
Vermilion Hives of Beauty.</p>
            <p>Much of the day being ſpent in this manner, <hi>Lacon</hi>
Wooing, and <hi>Glycera</hi> Weeping, he ſlabbering her
Cheeks with his frothy Lips, and ſhe bedewing his with
her Pearly Tears, at length he reſolved to conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
his joyes with Marriage, and compels her to go
with him to <hi>Venus</hi>-Temple, to ſacrifize a pair of Turtle-Doves,
thereby to procure the Goddeſſes Benediction.
But all the way as ſhe went, ſuch a Mart of Beauties
met in her ſweet Countenance, as purchaſed her as
many Admirers, as Beholders, and Beholders, as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
her Eyes inviting all eyes to behold, and her
ſuper-eminent Excellencies, alluring all Beholders to
adore her; ſo that few there were, whoſe Sex rendred
them not incapable to enjoy her Perfections, but would
have even pawned their ſouls to have bought ſo rich a
Treaſury of Beauties.</p>
            <p>Her beautious Face, wherein ſhined the Perfection
of all Perfections, was a viſible heart-melting Muſick;
which, as if compoſed of Charmes, entranc't Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and ſtruck Harmonious Raptures into adoring
mindes. Thus were the Eyes, and Hearts, and Tongues
of all led Captive by her Beauty, and forced to pay the
Tribute of looking, loving, and commending, to the
ſoveraignty of her Excellencies.</p>
            <p>At length Superſtition wedded to Admiration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
a conceit in their mindes, that ſure ſhe was more
than what her external form ſpake her to be; for there
ſeemed a greater mixture of Divine Exellencies in her
Beauty, than ever frail Mortality could boaſt of; and
her tranſcendent Glories ſeemed to run Parallel with
thoſe that have bribed Superſtitious ſouls to aſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

higheſt degree of Sacrilege, for any Mortal whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
to monopolize thoſe Treaſured in the pure vivid
Temple of her Beauty, which are only conſecrated to
the Gods; but much more for ſuch a deformed <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi>
as <hi>Lacon,</hi> to enjoy ſo fair a <hi>Venus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongſt the many Captives, that were enthralled
by <hi>Glyceras</hi> Beauty, whoſe hearts were drawn by its
magnetick force, it ſeems, this Knight was one; who
(as I told you) is the relater of of theſe ſad tydings,
whoſe fortune it was to eſpie her, as ſhe paſſed along
to the Temple: But no ſooner were his eyes fixed on
her, but ſhe, as a burning Mirour, wherein all the rayes
of Beauty centred, inflamed his heart with the pure
fire of chaſt Affection; and perceiving her Eyes with
an inundation of Tears ready to overflow their own
Beauties and with ſilent lamentation to bewail her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
innocency, (for though ſhe endeavoured to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
any inſurrections of Paſſion, what ſhe could, yet
Nature would exact ſome tears, that wonted Tribute,
that grief extorts in ſuch like Accidents) but I ſay, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
that internal ſorrow ſhe diſcloſed in her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
which (as he rightly interpreted it) could be
for nothing, but that ſhe, ſuch a miracle of Beauty,
ſhould be linked in Hymeneal Conjunction with ſuch
a Monſter of deformity, he ſaid was ſo moved with
compaſſion, that he thought he felt the quinteſsence
of each tear diſtil down into his Soul; and diſdaining
that ſuch a wonder of Uglineſs, ſhould be his Corrival
in affection, who might more aptly have contended in
Rivalry with ſome of <hi>Pluto</hi>'s fiends for deformity, he
drew his Sword, and compelled him to reſign her up
to himſelf, unleſs he prized a moments ſight of her, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
his life.</p>
            <p>No ſooner <hi>Lacon</hi> ſaw the naked ſteel, but he flies
like an Arrow out of a Bow, not for his ſwiftneſs, but
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:52129:125"/>
for the reſemblance his ſhrimpiſh-ſlimgut body had to
an Arrow, as each legg had to a Bow; and all the way as
he goes, he howls, and yells, as if he had been beſet with
armed Theeves; ſo that in a ſhort ſpace, ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of People ſurrounds the Knight, and his Lady,
as if ſome wonder had dropped down from Heaven;
ſome coming to behold the beauty of the Lady, whoſe
perfections fame, in ſo high a ſtyle, had proclamed in
their ears, but could not obtrude upon their belief;
others to ſee what was the reaſon of that Tumult: So
that though at firſt <hi>Glycera</hi> was the wonder that drew
the concourſe, yet at length the concourſe it ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the wonder.</p>
            <p>And as is the manner of ſuch Plebeian diſorders, they
ſeldom end without ſome ſlaughter; and ſo it happened
here: For ſeeing the Knight with his Sword drawn,
many thought he would have offered violence to the
Lady; others hearing <hi>Lacon</hi>'s roaring, thought he had
murdered him; others that were no leſs wounded with
her Beauty, than the Knight that had raviſhed her from
<hi>Lacon,</hi> and thought their Swords might purchaſe them
as good a Title to her, as he, reſolved either to have
her, or his life, or both; ſo that in an inſtant there was
nothing to be heard, but claſhings of Swords, cryes of
dead men, and all the ſymptomes of reigning confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>The Knight, that for a great ſpace had gallantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
himſelf and his Lady, making many of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of his Oppoſers fall, and do homage to his rage,
and their ſouls, which, to what their bodies had done,
would not conſent, he ſent to <hi>Tartarus,</hi> there to endure
an eternal Vaſſalage under <hi>Pluto:</hi> But yet having no
other Bulwark than his Buckler, to fortifie himſelf
againſt the incurſions of his Enemies, he at laſt received
a Wound, out of which ſuch plenty of Blood effuſed,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:52129:126"/>
that he was forced to ſurrender up himſelf, and his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to the mercy of his Opponents, and by that means,
he eſcaped from amongſt them.</p>
            <p>But now the quarrel grew as hot amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
which ſhould bear away the Prize; every man
accounting the loſs of his blood a cheap price, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
ſo rich a Treaſure; thus there grew no end of
their diſorders, till at length ſome Officers from the
King came, and with the Point of the Sword of Juſtice,
put a full point and Period to the rude ſcufflings of this
Rabble.</p>
            <p>But when enquiry was made after <hi>Glycera,</hi> no newes
could be heard of her; for taking her opportunity, when
her bloody Suters were all pleading their Intereſts,
with the Swords ſharp-peircing Rhetorick, ſhe eſcaped
away in the Crowd, and fled to a Wood not farr diſtant,
where ſhe ſpent all that night in bewailing her ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
eſtate; where her Soul would quaff in huge draughts
of woe, which, as not able to concoct, ſhe would pour
out again in Tears; Tears, that fell like melted Stars
from the Heaven of her Beauty.</p>
            <p>Thus did ſhe give up her ſelf to the dominion of an
unreaſonable Paſſion, which yet her Paſſion perſwaded
her was reaſonable. Sometimes grief would permit
her thus to lament her Woes: Oh Me! of all women
diſtreſt! Muſt I be ſhe in whom miſeries combine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
to make miſerable? Muſt all things have their
ſtint, but my griefs alone be boundleſs? The Sea hath
its ſhore, the Winds their limits, the Earth its centre,
and this ſpacious Globe of Heaven and Earth its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference;
but Ah! No ſhore, no limits, no centre,
no circumference to my ſorrows: No ſhore to the Seas
of my Tears, no limits to the Wind of my ſighs, no
centre to my deep-rooted griefs, nor no circumference
to the infinity of my miſeries: But I am become For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:52129:126"/>
Ware-houſe, where ſhe hoords up her ſtore of
ſorrowes; Hells Butt, where my Innocency is the
White, at which they ſhoot their invenomed Arrowes,
Winged with Malice, and Piled with Deſtruction; and
Heavens Tennis ball, when if with the vehemency of
the blow, my Soul chance to bound upwards towards
a Heaven of hope (for grief is ever at the loweſt, when
it is at the higheſt; and extremity of miſery, is ever
the dawning of mercy;) I ſay, if it chance to bound,
ſome diſmal Accident takes me at the re-bound, and
toſſes me into a Hell of calamities: Come then Death,
come quickly, bend thy Bow, and ſend thy ſharp-piled
Arrowes into this Pile of Duſt, that entombs my Soul.
But then her Breaſts would be brim-full with a raging
pang, which would ſtruggle for birth; but in ſtriving to
vent all, it could vent nothing, but only ſtop the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of her ſpeech; till at length her breath would be
delivered of a Groan, which capring thorow the Bowes
and Leaves, would be re-bounded to her Ears by Eccho;
which <hi>Glycera</hi> hearing, the better to paſs away the
mournful hours of the night, began thus to entertain
a Dialogue with her; which becauſe the Knight thought
worthy the relation to <hi>Pandion,</hi> as well as I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
I ſhall relate to you.</p>
            <p>Who is that (ſaid <hi>Glycera)</hi> derides my miſery? I,

            <p>Thus did ſhe ſpend that night, in wayling, weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſighing, ſobbing, grieving, groaning, till <hi>Titan</hi>'s
fiery Steeds had chaſed away the leſſer luminaries, that
had uſurped his Throne; but yet no Day-break of
hope dawned upon her with beams of comfort, but in
that woful deſpairing condition, did ſhe run through
invious Woods, rocky Deſarts, and hollow Caves,
where night kept houſe, with mournful ſolitarineſs, and
over hills and mountains inhabited only by the Clouds,
until at length ſhe came into a pleaſant Vale, incircled
with a murmuring River, which ſeemed with ſilent
mutterings to repine at her ſorrows; and over-ſpread
with a gloomy ſhade, by reaſon of hanging Rocks, that
defended it from the Suns invaſion, ſeemed, as it were,
d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Glycera</hi> obſerving this Vale to be a fit place, where
ſhe might bid her Adieu to the world, and all ſubluna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
contentments, reſolved there to ſit her down, and
dye: For of four dayes and nights, that ſhe had wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
through thoſe Deſarts, had ſhe not received the
leaſt ſuſtenance; and therefore her fainting ſpirits, too
weak Chains to faſten her Soul to her Body, were oft
ready to let looſe their Priſoner.</p>
            <p>By this River ſhe ſat down, and prayed to Heaven,
to let looſe the bands of Life, and not to retard ſlow-pac'd
Death any longer, but to conſort her among
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:52129:128"/>
the ſhades, that wander in the <hi>Elizium</hi> Plains: And
further begg'd, That when Death ſhould crumble her
body to Atomes, and reſolve it into individual Units,
that then her ſoul might be united to the great and
only Eternal Individual, and dwell among thoſe bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
Souls, that float like Atomes in the Sun-ſhine of
his reſplendent glory.</p>
            <p>This having ſaid, ſhe laid her down upon the Brink
of the mournfully-grumbling River, and cloſed her
Eyes, thinking never more to behold the loathed
Light, and hourly expected the ſweet Gaol-delivery of
her ſoul; but the Deſtinies that had inter-woven, and
twiſted the Threeds of her life, and miſery, ſo toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as neither could be clipped aſunder, without
clipping both, reſolved that the bottom of her life, and
miſery, ſhould not yet be unwound by the wounds of
Death; but nevertheleſs, a little to ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Vapour out of its moiſt bed of dirt, and ſent it to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock

            <p>But no ſooner had ſleep allayed the ſurges of Paſſion,
but <hi>Morpheus</hi> began to form ſtrange <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

imagination: Somtimes he would erect a high preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice
in her Fancy, ſo high, as the blended Clobe of
earth and water would look like an Atom, and then
tumble her down from thence, into ſome profound
abyſs, peopled with Adders, Toads, and Snakes, and
other venemous vermine; and then ſhe would ſtart
and give a ſhriek, that the whole Foreſt would re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ound
with the Eccho; but then the purlings of the ſilver
ſtream would huſh her aſleep again; and then the
drowſie Deity would Plant a Foreſt in her Brain, where
he would digg dens for Lions, Bears, and howling
Wolves, and build neſts for Owls, Batts, and Night-Ravens,
and other Birds of darkneſſe, and then the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:52129:129"/>
howling, roaring, bellowing, ſhrieking, croaking of
theſe wild inhabitants, would attach her faculties
with hideous terrors, and impriſon them in amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Thus in a confuſed manner ſhe ſpent the greateſt
part of the night, till about the time when <hi>Orion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins

with thouſands of miſeries, which ſhall flutter
forth out of that wound, and by heavens vengeance
glewed to thy ſoul, ſhall at length poſſeſs thee with a

reſign up thy ſelf to my luſt, or, by heavens (if there

but no matter, when I have poured out my

thy blood thoſe pollutions wherewith thy ſoul in the
commixture may have ſtained mine. This ſaid, he
binds her fair hands with her hair, that lovely hair, that
had fettered and bound ſo many hearts, muſt now bind
her own hands, and tears her garments, and in deſpight
of all her ſhrieking, groaning, crying, weeping, he at
length unloads his luſt, and not content only to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
her of her honor, after he had thus demoliſhed the
Cittadel of her vertue, but he with his Ponyard diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enthrones
thoſe powers, that ſhould govern her facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and ſeals pale death in the majeſtick throne of her
Beauty; and thus he leaves her like a fair flower nipt
with the mornings Froſt, hanging down her head, as if
aſhamed of her declining glory; her face covered with
hoary paleneſs, as if deaths cold blaſt had congealed
the dew of her tears into a hoary Froſt.</p>
            <p>But by this time the Sun having notice of the Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
acted in his abſence, by Nights permiſſion, had
ſent the morning as his Scout, to draw the Curtain of
the night, and deſcry whether any ſuch horrid Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies,
as even reſounded thorough the arches of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
were committed under the protection of the
Night; whilſt he came after with an Army of beams to
depoſe her from her Throne of Jet: but no ſooner had
he ſhaken his dewy locks, wet with toying too long
with <hi>Thetis</hi> in her watery bower, but he beheld this ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed
wounded Lady; and no ſooner beheld than he
ſent his light to call away a loytring dream that was
ſent of an Embaſſie from heaven to <hi>Polienus,</hi> a great
Nobleman of <hi>Crete,</hi> that dwelt in that Foreſt, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
of this curſed act, and to command him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:52129:130"/>
her. When a deep ſilence hath fixt an intenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
upon the ſouls faculties, then is the fitteſt time for
divine impreſſions. Though exemption from ſad fates,
is not alwaies entailed upon innocence, yet that unſeen
<hi>Nemeſis</hi> that runs through the whole machine of the
univerſe, ſeldom connives at the wrongs of diſtreſt
Vertue.</p>
            <p>The bloody wretch had no ſooner ſent his Ponyard
as a meſſenger of death to her, but heaven ſtabbed
his ſoul with horrors, that in a frenzy he leaps from a
Rock, and daſhes his body into as many pieces, as his
ſoul was torn with Fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ies. So apt a death did heaven
prepare for one, whoſe rocky heart had broke the neck
of a Ladies chaſtity. <hi>Polienus,</hi> who (as I ſaid) had been
divinely informed of this Ladies miſery, awakens out
of his dream, and ſeemes to have a bloody miſt before
his eyes, that repreſents all things to his ſurprized
fancy, horrid and tragical; ſo that in amazement he
ariſes, ſlips on his morning Gown, takes his ſword in
his hand, and haſts he knows not whither, to aſſiſt he
knows not what. But the heavenly powers who make
uſe of earthly inſtruments to execute their reaſonable
decrees, whilſt men only act their own unreaſonable
paſſions; and range humane diſorders into a divine
kind of order; ſo ordered his diſorderly ſteps, as that
in a ſhort moment, he came to a place where he heard
a mournful groan, which uſhered in theſe words, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens!
ſeparate my ſpotleſs ſoul, from this defiled bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and as my life doth, ſo oh! let the extravagant
follies of my youth, paſs out together. Oh! Receive

            <p>
               <hi>Polienus</hi> hearing this runs in a deep amazement
ſome paces farther, till he finds this poor Lady in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

For ſhe lay imbalmed in her own blood, her hands en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled

as deluged thoſe beauties that inhabited her skin. <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enus</hi>
ſeeing this woful ſpectacle, ſtood as if a profound
ſenſe of her miſery, had ſtruck him into an inſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>At length recovering himſelf he runs to her, ſnatches
out the Steel that lay bathed in a fountain of blood, and
ſtops up the wound, and feels her pulſe, to ſee if life
had yet forſaken its fortreſs the heart, where it laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires,
and perceiving the living bloud to move in her
veins, and ſent as an Envoy from the heart, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him, that though life was ſtreightly beſieged in
its Cittadel, with ſquadrons of pangs, yet it had not
quite ſurrendered to the government of death, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs
the bloody breach, as well as he could, and runs
home and fetched men from his Caſtle, that conveyed
her thither with all ſpeed upon a downy Couch; where
her ſent for Chirurgions with ſpeed to her, who with
their extraordinary care and skill, in a few days reſtored
her to her primitive health and beauty. When <hi>Polienus</hi>
ſaw that ſhe was recovered, and no pretence of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
could hinder his enquiry what ſhould be the cauſe
of her miſery, he uſing ſomething more freedom of
diſcourſe than ordinary, requeſted her to acquaint him,
whether ſome direful chance, arm'd with mercileſs and
inevitable fate, or ſome accurſed hand had endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to put that untimely date, to her life and happineſs?
<hi>Glycera</hi> conſidering what great engagements he had

how ſhe fled from the Nunnery in <hi>Theſſalia,</hi>

to avoid the tedious Love of <hi>Pandion;</hi> and how ſnatcht
up by a Pirate, who at Sea endeavoured to raviſh her,
and then how in his rage, being diſappointed of his
deſires, he threw her over-board; but then how ſhe
was moſt miraculouſly preſerved by a Dolphin (that
faithful friend to mankind in adverſities) upon whom
ſhe had rid up and down for the ſpace of ſeveral hours
without any hope of ſuccour; how ſhe was relieved by a
Fiſherman, and by him brought to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> but when
he had conveyed her hither, how in all particulars he
miſuſed her, not permitting her to go aſhore, and then
to make amends for all his abuſes, how at laſt he ſold
her to a deformed Swain, that carried her to his cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and how the next day, as ſhe was going to be
joyned with him by <hi>Hymens</hi> bands in <hi>Venus</hi> Temple, a
Knight came and reſcued her from him, but then what
a tumult there was raiſed with the ruſticks roaring, and
how that occaſioned a combate, between the Knight
and others, that thought to have forc't her from him,
as he had from <hi>Lacon;</hi> how at length he was forc't to
reſign her up to them, by that means to ſave himſelf:
but then how when they had obtained their prize, they
could not agree among themſelves, but fell upon one

about the cauſe, ſo that with vehement impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuning
he ſcrued thus much from her, in a broken man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that a villain would have forced her, and would
have killed her. As ſoon as <hi>Polienus</hi> heard this, he
felt his heart even divided between the two paſſions of
pity and revenge, at length pity augmenting revenge,
gave that the ſoveraignty over his will; ſo that in a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
he kneels down, and implores heaven, that the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
due to ſuch an accurſed act might light on him,
if he permitted that to the unrevenged; and with
that <hi>Glycera</hi> having given him a Character of him, as
well as ſhe could, he takes his ſword, and mounts his
Steed, and ſo rides out into the Foreſt in purſute of
this wretch, but ere he had gone a quarter of a mile, he
found him dead upon the ground, having broke his
neck with the fall from the Rock. When <hi>Polienus</hi> ſaw
this, he was glad that heavens vengeance had found him
out, but ſorry that any one had been the executioner
beſides himſelf, but however he goes home to his
Caſtle, and commands his men to fetch the body, and
give it to his dogs.</p>
            <p>Juſtice thus being done upon him, <hi>Glycera</hi> began a
little to allay the pangs of ſorrow, that daily had wont
to ſtir up ſome great commotions in her breſt, and to
entertain ſome ſmall familiarity with mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th, which had
ſo long been exiled from her, ſo that in a ſhort time
ſhe was reſtored to her health, and pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ine beauty,
which thoſe excellencies before drowned in ſorrow,
now ſwimming in her countenance, ſufficiently teſtified,
ſo that <hi>Polienus</hi> who before beheld her only with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
now looks upon her with admiration, for ſhe
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:52129:132"/>
ſeemed to him not compoſed of the common princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
but of ſome heavenly materials, even refined to
an immateriality, fit to captivate an immaterial ſoul, ſo
that at length he never viewed her, but he ſaw ſome
ſweetneſs, ſome grace, ſome delicacy, that gradually
converted his admiration into affection, and by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible
aſcenſion gave love the ſoveraignty over his
heart; and now <hi>Glycera,</hi> and none but <hi>Glycera</hi> grew
the object of his thoughts, the ſubject of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
and the joy of his heart. Long did <hi>Polienus</hi>
cover his affection with the veil of ſilence, but love,
though its chiefeſt reſidence is in the heart, yet it will
oft peep forth at the Caſements of the eyes, and like
the Bee, though its dwelling is in the Hive of the heart,
yet it muſt come forth to feed it ſelf with the heavenly
ſweets imparadized in thoſe flowers that grow in the
Garden of Beauty; ſo <hi>Polienus</hi> though he endeavoured
to conceal his griefs, yet his eyes would diſcloſe what
his heart incloſed, for if ever he was in her preſence,
her beauties attracted both his eyes and heart, and the
radiant beams that glanc'd from hers would ſeem to
ſtrike upon his heart ſtrings, and compoſe ſuch a ſoft en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trancing
melody, as he thought he felt his very Soul
charmed into a love extaſie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Polienus</hi> thus obſerving daily how love did degree it
ſelf into his heart, and a crowd of inevitable inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
iſſuing thereupon, thronging into his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
he ſtrove to ſuppreſs all inſurrections of that
paſſion that thus endeavoured to depoſe his will, and
make his Reaſon do homage to it what he could. For
you muſt know, this <hi>Polienus</hi> was one of prime quality,
having both a great wit, and a greater fortune, ſo that
what the former could deviſe, the latter could accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh;
his perſon alſo not being meanly beautiful, yet
his beauty conſiſting in a mean between a maſculine
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:52129:133"/>
comelineſs, and a feminine ſweetneſs, and one who as
he was never a hater, ſo neither ever any great admirer
of the female ſex, but looked on them as piles of well
complexioned duſt, that like <hi>Sodoms</hi> Apples with the
leaſt touch of Times finger would moulder to nothing,
or as Natures painted Gallipots, where you may meet
as oft with poiſon as with a potion; where he ſaw Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
enſhrined in the Temple of Beauty, there he could
even adore, and counted ſuch as Angels inveſted in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
fleſh, but where he ſaw Vertue lye bleeding in a
Roſie cheek, and Lillyed beauty to ſerve only for Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtities
winding ſheet, thoſe he counted as Devils
clothed in an Angels form, and born to tempt men to
recede from vertue, and ſent to be plagues to the
minds of men, and preſerved for eternal peſtilence to
the world.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Polienus</hi> had been beloved by <hi>Amoroſia</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to <hi>Loritus</hi> King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> a Lady whoſe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments
might well have challenged a reciprocal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
having a delicate wit treaſured in the Ivory
Cabinet of a beautiful body, and as ſhe had powerful
paſſions in a great mind, ſo her mind had great power
over her paſſions, ſo that long ſhe could conceal her love,
ſealing it under the impreſſion of her memory; but
(you know) love is ſuch a ſtrong paſſion that you may as
well think to ſqueez down the Sun-beams, and hinder
their reflection, as to ſuppreſs the flames of love, but
in deſpight of all oppoſition, yea the more for oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they will rebound from the heart to the eyes, and
are legible there to any that are not unacquainted with
the Characters of affections; and beſides, in women
that paſſion is ever moſt viſible, their Ivory faireneſs is
but as white paper where they pourtray the picture of
their minds, which their tongues are loth to betray,
their thin skins being as tranſparent Cryſtal, through
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:52129:133"/>
which the beams of love wil ſhine, &amp; therefore the moſt
Chaſt in that reſpect have not the gift of continence,
but though they may think to Cloyſter up Love as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſe
in the chaſt Nunneries of their hearts, yet alas,
upon the leaſt allurements of their beloveds beauty,
they will ſuffer all ſuch vain reſolves to be raviſhed
from them, and their eyes and tongues to be wedded to
a heart-inflaming eye; ſo it was with <hi>Amoroſia,</hi> in his
abſence, his praiſes was all the entertainment of her
diſcourſe, in his preſence, her eyes muſt move with his,
as if the beams that came from his had chained hers,
and as oft as ſhe ſpake, ſhe muſt accent her ſentences
with ſighs, by thoſe fumes plainly diſcovering the fire
in her heart; which though <hi>Polienus</hi> obſerved, yet he
would not be obſerved to have obſerved it, but rather
penned down his obſervations in the leiger of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Amoroſia</hi>'s affection that had thus long been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned
in her heart, would no longer endure reſtraint,
but muſt either come forth, or break the priſon, ſo that
no longer able to endure the unſupportable tyranny of
her paſſion, ſhe goes to <hi>Polienus,</hi> and with as much
eloquence as a mind wracked between the extremiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s
of two violent paſſions, Love and Fear, and diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the contrary thoughts of pondering how to
ſpeak, and whether to ſpeak at all, could frame, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciphering
firſt in her ſweet countenance the prologue
of her diſcourſe, ſhe diſplays the ſtorehouſe of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
and withall craves of him to poize them in the
ballances of honor, and not to let this condeſcenſion
of hers exhale any miſts of uncharitable thoughts,
that might obſcure her Vertue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Polienus</hi> obſerving in what coſtly robes both her
ſpeech and countenance was apparelled, the former
clad in the refined Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:52129:134"/>
mind with admiration, but in the latter ſuch a Majeſty
clothed in purple ſat inthroned, as ſeemed rather to
dazle than delight, ſo that he could not but wonder,
though he could not love, or rather he wondred why
he could not love; but though her perſwaſive ſpeeches,
and ſpeaking looks could not dart affection into him,
yet they even tran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fixt his heart with compaſſion,
which procured from him only a ſhort reply, wiſhing
that heaven would crown him with ſo much happineſs,
as to raiſe his merits to that height, that deſervedly he
might be ſeated in the throne of her heart, but till then
he craved pardon if he rejected her ſute, and begged of
her, rather to accuſe his fortunes than him, that did
thus incapacitate him to ſatisfie ſo great a debt as the
high honor ſhe had done him did oblige him to.
But however, ſince he could not retaliate her affection,
nor retribute her unparallel'd favours, yet he would
accept them with a deſire to compenſate, when
his benign Stars ſhould bleſs him with a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>With this anſwer ſhe went home, endeavoring to
caſt as charitable a gloſs upon it, as expreſſions of ſo
deep a ſable dye would bear; ſo eaſie it is to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
a ſoul that beholds all things through the refracted
medium of affection, which will repreſent things
ſtreight though in themſelves never ſo oblique. Thus
ſhe remained for a long time, great with child with
expectation of ſome not only verbal but real teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of <hi>Polienus</hi>'s affection, and longed for that time
that ſhould Midwive ſome ſuch happy production. But
<hi>Polienus,</hi> whoſe heart was not con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thoſe exquiſite methods he uſed to avoid and anſwer her
importunities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amoroſia</hi> obſerving no fruit of her endeav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:52129:134"/>
her hopes to wane, but deſpair growing to the
full, began to wax pale and wan, and pine away;
and thoſe beauties that had hitherto retained their
luſtre, though weather-beat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n with the ſtormy
frowns of misfortune, as if they had been immar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible,
now began to fade with his cold replies,
like a fair flower nipt with the morning Froſt; thus did
her love feed upon her beauty, as if <hi>Cupid</hi> were turned
Cannibal, and would devour his mother for want of
other repaſt. Concealed affection is like a Wolf in a
womans Breaſt, if no other refection be provided, be
ſure it feeds on that. The ſimilitudes indeed are home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but apt and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ignificative to expreſs the nature of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned
paſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Loritus</hi> her Father obſerving her withered beauty
on a day, ſtrictly charged her to tell him what was the
worm that bit the root of ſo ſweet a flower, and withall
promiſed that the one half of his Kingdom ſhould
freely be given to purchaſe her content; with that
ſhe gave him a full relation of her unſucceeding af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Loritus</hi> hearing this, ſends with ſpeed for <hi>Polienus,</hi>
and ſmoothing the rough furrows of his countenance
(being a little moved, when he firſt heard how his
Daughter was rejected) he endeavors with ſoft and
mild perſwaſions to allure his conſent to his own felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
but when he ſaw all to be in vain, he conjures him
by all the terrifying words, and enraged mind could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite,
and Majeſty utter, to give him his final anſwer,
which was only this, that Nature had engaged him to
perpetual Chaſtity.</p>
            <p>Theſe words were as fire, put under the Cauldron of
his boyling blood; ſo that he ſwears by <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Revenge, like Lightning, ſhould find him out, and
hurl him to deſtruction: And believe me (ſaid he)
Kings ſwords reach from Pole to Pole, and run paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
with all Climates.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Polienus</hi> hearing this, fearing he ſhould be entrapt
with the delicate Baits of beauty that Court did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
in, he ſequeſtred himſelf wholly from their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
and built him a ſtately Caſtle, where now <hi>Gly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera</hi>
found him.</p>
            <p>But I have too much digreſſed with this long rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet it is only to ſhew what Squadrons of misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
attended his affection, ſo that he durſt not har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
a thought, that would counſel him to harbour his
Paſſion, but ſtrove to drive away his new gueſt, with
bad entertainment; but then Love began ſo to play
the Tyrant, that nothing would ſatisfie him, but the
conſtant Tribute of ſighs and groans; neither could
ſuch windy meat, ſatiate his hungry deſire, but he muſt
now and then feed upon the dainties of <hi>Glycera</hi>'s beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
ſo that at laſt, <hi>Polienus</hi> was forced to unlock the
Cabinet of his thoughts, and diſcover what a Jewel
he there treaſured up; no other than <hi>Glycera</hi>'s Picture,
lively engraven on a rich Tablet, gilded with affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and incloſed in a Wounded-Heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Glycera</hi> beholding <hi>Polienus</hi> ſo accompliſhed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
how her body was abuſed, thought if e're ſhe
conſented to him, it might be a means to obſcure that
ſhame, which otherwiſe would obſcure her Honour;
therefore began to embrace his motion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Polienus</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eeing her thus to ſtoop to his lure, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to ſqueeze the quinteſſence of benefit out of this
opportunity, and to give ſuch a thruſt to the falling-ſtone
of her Paſſion, that it ſhould never reſt, till it
came to the Centre of Felicity: So that, to be brief, the
day was appointed when <hi>Hymen</hi>'s Bonds ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate
their joyes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:52129:135"/>
Thus long did heaven give intermiſſion to <hi>Glycera</hi>'s
ſorrows; but alas, many times ther's a reſerve of miſery,
that puts to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>light all our happineſs; when we think we
have routed the main Battel, and begin to erect Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies
of joyes, and to lead Captive all our former ſad
Accidents, at the Chariot of our triumphing fortune;
ſo it was with <hi>Glycera,</hi> joy began to triumph in her
Eyes, and her heart bid Adieu to all diſcontent, and
the ſudden delight ſhe took in thoſe rich Excellencies,
wherewith Nature had endued <hi>Polienus,</hi> elevated her
mind to ſo high a pitch of contentment, that ſhe almoſt
thought ſome heavenly Apparition had imparadized her
thoughts in a golden repreſentation of <hi>Elizium:</hi> but
theſe towring joyes did but lead her to a precipice of
miſery, that ſo her fall might be the greater; for before
the marriage-day, the King had intelligence of it.</p>
            <p>The multitude may be well compared to a Foreſt,
that Ecchoes all things ſpoke or done, to their Kings
ears.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Loritus</hi> hearing this, reſolved that his revenge ſhould
be of an equal Latitude with his threatning, and though
<hi>Amoroſia</hi> upon her knees entreated for his Pardon, yet
he ſhook her off, and told her, That the heavens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
though more powerful, yet are not more juſt
and reſolute to execute their Decrees, than he was.
And accordingly, he ſends a Party of Horſe in the
night, who being let into the Caſtle by ſome Loyal
Perſons, but treacherous ſervants to <hi>Polienus,</hi> they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
both him and <hi>Glycera</hi> in theis beds, who little
dreamt of ſuch a ſad interception of their happineſs, or
that their new-coyn'd joyes ſhould thus prove Droſs,
and not paſs current.</p>
            <p>Thus doth a black ſhadow of miſery attend a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine
of proſperity. Thus doth Hope, as a Proſpective-glaſs,
preſent to our dim-e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:52129:136"/>
joy; but in the end, it proves nothing but a vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Cloud, or a Rock to ſhip-wrack our hopes and
contents upon.</p>
            <p>Thus many times when we think to be conducted by
the glimmering glories of this World, through a night
of ſorrows, to ſome Haven, where our deluded thoughts
perſwade us Bliſs reſides, they indeed prove but an
<hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> that lights us through the invious Paths,
and Miſts of airy deluſions, to a precipice of miſery,
where they leave us.</p>
            <p>So it was with <hi>Polienus</hi> and <hi>Glycera,</hi> Hope, the bright
Harbinger of the dawning day of Comfort, had riſen
upon them, and the Morning had diſtilled her Dew up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their blooming joyes; but ah! The one was no
ſooner riſen, than ſet; and the other no ſooner fallen, than
frozen, by the cold blaſts of Deſpair, that nipt their
ſpringing happineſs in the Bud: for that night they
were conveyed to <hi>Gortyna,</hi> a Town of great reſort in
<hi>Cyprus,</hi> being the Centre of it, and ſtands near the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Lethaeus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next morning, <hi>Polienus</hi> was adjudged to be
thrown off a high Rock, but whether or no executed,
the Knight could not reſolve; but <hi>Glycera</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to <hi>Kolax</hi> his houſe, one who was much favoured
of the King, not for his merit, but for his flattery, being
a man of a ſervile leaden ſpirit, and one that would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
bow, and comply with the Kings humour, and
receive any Form, or Impreſſion he would ſtamp upon
him; and thus by this counterfeit Coyn, gilded over
with fair pretences, did he purchaſe his Kings favour,
and poſſeſs his eaſie nature; ſo that if any thing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
extraordinary fidelity, was to be done, he was
the Perſon Elected, and for that reaſon, <hi>Glycera</hi> became
his Priſoner.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Glycera,</hi> under all theſe inquietudes, behaved her
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:52129:136"/>
ſelf with ſo much aequanimity, as plainly ſhewed, that
her ſoul had more Antidote in it, than misfortune had
Poyſon; as if her conſtant ſuffering Fortunes inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
had hardned her ſoul, contrary to the nature of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
to an impenetrability: Which <hi>Kolax</hi> obſerving,
together with the vivacity of her Wit, the magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of her Spirit, the ſolidity of her Judgment, and the
Majeſty that attended them all, could not ſufficiently
behold her; and at length fell from beholding, to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and from admiring, to affecting; and thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
his Priſoners Priſoner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Glycera</hi> perceiving both viſible and audible effects of
his paſſion, thought a favourable entertainment of him,
ſo far as vertue would permit, might be a means to
procure ſome liberty from her ſtrict reſtraint; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
received him ſtill with a Countenance as full of

and from thence (ſhe ſaid) the paſſage to <hi>Theſſalia</hi> was
not difficult.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Glycera</hi> poizing theſe Propoſals in her judgment,
thought it not inconſiſtent with prudence to accept of
them; for all thoſe mountains of diſcouragements, that
deſpair raiſed in her thoughts, now lay level to her wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
and what would be the concluſion of her Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſhe knew not; but however, this ſhe reſolved
ſhould be the Concluſion of her doubtfully revolving
thoughts, that a few dayes ſhould put a Concluſion to
her abode there.</p>
            <p>The next day <hi>Zelota</hi> comes to <hi>Glycera,</hi> with a Cup
commixt, not with a ſleepy, but a poyſonous drug (oh
heavens, what will not a malitious mind, animated with
Revenge, be provoked unto? What venemous gore
will not diſtil out of the ranklings of a gangrened
mind, feſtered with the incurable wounds of jealouſie?)
<hi>Glycera</hi> not at all imagining what a horrid enterprize
ſhe went about to atchive, yet all the way as ſhe went,
a ſtrange kind of horror ſeized upon her ſpirits, the very
Ayr ſeemed to fetter her leggs, and every ſhadowy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
or even ſhadow of ſuch an appearance, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to interrupt her Progreſs, that ſhe even thought her
ſelf hurryed away, by a ſtrange kind of fate, contrary to
the bent of her own Genius; however, ſhe ſtops not, but
goes to <hi>Kolax,</hi> and tells him, that ſhe had brought him
a Love-po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion, that would incite amorous deſires in
the coldeſt nature: <hi>Kolax</hi> accepts it with gratitude,
(as love you know inveſts all things with an amability,
that proceeds from the Object beloved) and drinks of
it with ſuch exceſs, as if he had a mind to convert him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:52129:137"/>
into Loves individual ſubſtance. But no ſooner
had he emptyed the Cup of Poyſon, than the poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Cup had filled him with pain and horror; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
roared out ſome curſes on <hi>Glycera,</hi> he dyed, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her overwhelmed with amazing Terrors, and rer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying
amazement.</p>
            <p>The Servants of the houſe, hearing this hidious cry,
ran up to their Maſters Chamber, where they found
him dead with Poyſon, and <hi>Glycera</hi> with aſtoniſhment;
affrighted with this woful ſight, ſome ran to find <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lota,</hi>
but ſhe that morning had taken a walk abroad, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to be abſent at the execution of her bloody
Plot, thereby to avoid ſuſpition: Others apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to recall <hi>Glycera</hi>'s miſerable ſenſes, but ah! to be
the more ſenſible of her miſery, and others ran to call
near-adjoyning Inhabitants, to behold this lamentable
Spectacle; ſo that in a ſhort time, Fame had blazed
abroad this direful Tragedy, that it re-ſounded in the
Kings Court, and at length came to the Kings ears al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo;
who no ſooner heard it, but he grew even diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with ſorrow, for the loſs of his minion, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
preſently to ſend <hi>Glycera</hi> after him, of a meſſage
to <hi>Pluto,</hi> to require him in his name, to releaſe <hi>Kolax</hi>
from his dark Priſons, and ſend him among the living,
or elſe, if he could provoke all the Powers in Heaven
and Earth to deſtroy his Kingdom, he would do it.
<hi>Amoroſia</hi> his Daughter, that had a Character given her
by ſome of <hi>Kolax</hi> his Servants, of <hi>Glycera,</hi> how ſhe
was a woman endued with ſolid Vertue, profound Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and ſtrong Judgment, and hated not ſo much the
name of Vice, as to be vitious; that if the Air had a
voyce, it could proclaim no ſuch infection from her,
as conſtantly ſteams from an impious ſoul; ſo that an
Angel in his moſt recluſe retirements, is not more
chaſt than ſhe; and whoever had an eye, that could
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:52129:138"/>
have pierced into her heart, would have been a greater
admirer of her Internal Vertue, than External Beauty;
though in that was ſufficiently pourtrayed all the linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of a mind fraught with goodneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amoroſia</hi> I ſay, having this deſcription given her,
could not let common fame commit ſuch a Rape on
her Charity, or entice her to wed her belief to the tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
reports that all places abounded in, but fell down
on her knees, and in a paſſionate manner implored <hi>Gly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera</hi>'s
remiſſion of her father, or at leaſt a forbearance
of Execution, till her Cauſe was heard. But the King,
the more enraged with her Petitions, thus replyed:
What, ſaid he, we ſhall have you Attorney to every
Strumpet, to plead for their unlawful courſes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede
for perverting juſtice; no Daughter, let this
reſolve of mine henceforth make you ceaſe the renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of this ſort of entreaties; for, believe it, I'll not
ſuffer an Innocents blood to ruſt that Sword of juſtice,
that hath hitherto been kept bright, to the dazling of
admiring Beholders.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amoroſia</hi> hearing this, forbore any further ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
till her father freed from his paſſionate Feaver,
might be able to reliſh her counſel; which being not
long after, ſhe goeth to him, and informs him of her
ſtate, and lays before him all the probabilities of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
a mind diſcreet and charitable could ſuppoſe,
together with the inconveniences might enſue a raſh
execution of a Forein Lady, allyed (as ſhe heard) to
the blood Royal of <hi>Theſſalia,</hi> and courted by Prince
<hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>dion,</hi> and withall gave him ſuch a deſcription of her,
that at laſt divorced the former reſolutions from his
mind, and wrought in him ſuch a compaſſion for <hi>Gly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera</hi>'s
adverſity, that he commanded ſhe ſhould be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norably
attended and entertained, but yet impriſoned,
for the ſpace of about a year and half, within which
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:52129:138"/>
time, if <hi>Pandion</hi> ſent not ſome Knight, that by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring
with and overcoming ſome Knight of <hi>Cyprus,</hi>
ſhould releaſe her, that then ſhe ſhould endure the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
of the Law; but in the mean time, he would
diſpatch a meſſenger unto him, to give him intelligence
of her condition, and his determination. The meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
that he ſent, was the Knight that I ſpake of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and the perſon elected to atchieve this enterpriſe,
is my ſelf.</p>
            <p>No ſooner had he ſpoke theſe words, than a ſhrill
noiſe peirced their ears, with ſuch an acuteneſs, as if it
had fled before to make way for a groan that preſently
ſucceeded it, which they hearing, imagining they
came from ſome diſtreſſed Lady, ran with ſpeed to help
her, and juſt as they turned round, they eſpied <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi>
under a Tree, hard by the place where they had
ſate and diſcourſed, fallen upon the ground in a
ſwound. <hi>Periander</hi> ſeeing this, chafes her tender
limbs, and recovers her out of her deadly trance, who
when ſhe perceived her ſelf reſtored to her ſelf, ſhe
falls a weeping and ſighing; ah, ſaid ſhe, can my <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
find in his heart to leave me? I can and will
leave thee with all my heart (ſaid <hi>Periander)</hi> I mean, all
my heart with thee; but to find in my heart to leave
thee, I cannot, ſince I can find nothing there but thee.
Oh but <hi>Periander</hi> ſhall not go (ſaid ſhe) <hi>Periander</hi> will
not go (ſaid he) for hee'l leave his ſoul with thee, his
better part.</p>
            <p>And will you then be gone (ſaid <hi>Florinda</hi> weeping)
what ſhall become of me the while, think you? Live in
as much repoſe (ſaid <hi>Periander)</hi> as a vertuous mind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
by heaven with earthly joys can extract from
its own internal felicity. Can true Lovers part then
with ſo much eaſe (ſaid ſhe) I had hoped—(and
then the tears diſtilled down her Cheeks in ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:52129:139"/>
as interrupted her ſpeech, yet fain ſhe would
have ſpoke, but her ſtriving to ſpeak, made her ſpeech
the more difficult, ſo that grief made ſo large a Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis,
as if it would have put a period to her life, in the
midſt of her ſentence) but proceeding, I had hoped
(ſaid ſhe) <hi>Periander</hi> had thought I had loved him too
dearly, ever to take any repoſe in his abſence. But
though he can part from me, and exchange a ſpotleſs
affection, for a little blood-ſtained honor, though he
can inſatiably carowſe my tears, yet I could not ſee a tear
drop from his eyes, but 'twould corrode my ſoul, nor
can I part from him, and retain my ſelf, for affection
hath ſo glewed him to my heart, as the leaſt ſeparation
would rend it in pieces.</p>
            <p>But he diſcourſing to her, how much it did import
his honor, and of what evil conſequence to <hi>Danpions</hi>
affairs his negligence in that reſpect would be, ſhe
hung on his neck, and kiſſed his cheeks, and all the
while bathed her kiſſes and his cheeks in tears. Oh
(ſaid ſhe) do not, do not go, if we muſt part now, we
muſt part for ever. But with that, as if every letter in
the word, <hi>Ever,</hi> had been a thunderbolt ſhot from the
ſulphurous clouds of love mixt with ſorrow in her heart,
her ſenſes were on a ſudden overwhelmed with extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
and ſhe falls down into a ſwoun. <hi>Periander</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, was forc't to take an abrupt leave of <hi>Danpion,</hi>
whoſe dear affection each to other would elſe have
compelled them to be more copious in their parting
ceremonies, and takes <hi>Florinda</hi> in his arms, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
her to a houſe neer adjoyning, where we leave
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Danpion</hi> being thus unhappily deprived of his friends,
and with them of his hopes of ever attaining either his
Love, or his Kingdom, began moſt paſſionately to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
his condition. For <hi>Periander</hi> that had ſo far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:52129:139"/>
him on <hi>Pandions</hi> ſide, and <hi>Florinda</hi> by whoſe
means he had accompliſhed many projects in <hi>Hiarba</hi>'s
Court, and who had defended him ſo often from <hi>Hiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi>
and <hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s diſpleaſure, were now both
gone, ſo that he ſeemed at once to have loſt both his
ſword and buckler, and left alone to manage his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
and bear the brunt of all.</p>
            <p>In this condition he returned to his Chamber, and
there gave vent to his ſorrows, and in the midſt of all
his ſadneſs, he ſets down this reſolution with himſelf,
that ſince all his hopes were fled with <hi>Periander</hi> and
<hi>Florinda,</hi> he would quench that Veſtal fire of chaſt
love that flamed in his heart, which could only be kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
at the beams of <hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s beauty, and with the
ſmoke of that extinguiſhed flame, ſmother his grief,
and deface that image of ſorrow deciphered in his de-dejected
countenance, and ſtreight apply himſelf
to <hi>Hiarbas</hi> will, and comply with his humors, by that
means not onely to enter into, but to interr him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
alive during his dying life in his affection.</p>
            <p>But humane determinations are but as gliſtering Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
where ſome bright reflections may pleaſe the fancy
for a while, but ſoon vaniſh into Air with the leaſt blaſt
of a divine decree; every beam of a Planet comes laden
with transformations, which though it cannot have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
commerce with the immaterial ſoul, yet it will
bribe the Organs, and by that means unhinge the doors
of reſolution that exclude inconſtancy from the
mind.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Danpion,</hi> however for a time he flattered his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
with the thoughts of blotting out the Characters
of love with black oblivion, yet at length he found
love to be of ſuch a ſtrange invincible unreſiſtable force,
that the more he endeavoured to conquer its rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the more it rebelled and conquered his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:52129:140"/>
ſo that in deſpight of his reaſon, he was led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
by his paſſion. Flaſhes of beauty may dazle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders
eyes, but where they light to purpoſe, they
melt the ſteelieſt hearts, and make them receive impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of love, which cannot ſoon be obliterated: which
<hi>Danpions</hi> experience could confirm, for the more he
endeavoured to extinguiſh the flames of affection with
the cold blaſts of deſpair, the more ardent they grew,
and the leſs tolerable; ſo that at length with conſtant
pining, not onely the colour, but the figure of his face
began to be altered; which many obſerved, as alſo
how he affected ſolitarineſs, to walk and talk alone,
ſometimes breathing forth his complaints in the Groves
and Gardens, ſometimes inwardly ſighing, and groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as if his heart held a dialogue with ſorrow. And
when he was in company, his thoughts ran ſo much of
<hi>Amphigenia,</hi> as all the jollity and recreation the
Court did abound in, ſeemed to him but unneceſſary
Parentheſes, and tedious digreſſions, to that ſweet
ſubject that his ſoul ſilently diſcourſed of. And when
he was in <hi>Hiarbas</hi> preſence, though his policy would
compell him to throw off thoſe mourning weeds
wherein grief had attired his countenance, leſt he
ſhould lay a foundation for ſuſpicion in <hi>Hiarbas</hi>
thoughts, yet the countenance holds ſuch a ſympathy
with the mind, that it is very difficult, ſo to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
a contrary affection, that a judicious eye in every
lineament of the face may not read the diſſimulation;
ſo that <hi>Hiarbas</hi> could not but by every action diſcern
the paſſion, wherewith he was affected, his dull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
looks, his impertinent diſcourſe, his frequent
ſobbing, abrupt ſighing, and the very tone of his
voice, that did plainly proclame his heart held a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
with ſorrow.</p>
            <p>This ſuddain alteration in <hi>Danpions</hi> countenance
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:52129:140"/>
and behaviour, bred admiration in many Noblemen of
the Court, but eſpecially one <hi>Baſcanius</hi> a great emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
and corrival of <hi>Danpions,</hi> obſerving his deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that he might diſcover the cauſe of his grief
(which he conjectured could not be ordinary, ſince
the effect was ſo ſuperlative and extraordinary) he on a
day in a private place meeting with <hi>Kalapiſtus, Danpions</hi>
Page, examined him very ſtrictly, concerning his Lord,
what the cauſe was of his extremity of grief, whether
he was in love, and had received ſome repulſe, or
whether he had committed any traiterous fact, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
diſcovery, the latter of which he chiefly hoped
might be the diſtemper, and if ſo, he in his thoughts
had ſoon found a remedy, to wit, remedileſs diſgrace and
ruine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kalapiſtus</hi> of late having unjuſtly (as he thought) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a box on the ear from his Maſter, as he was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with him in the Cypreſs-grove; the occaſion of
which, being onely this, <hi>Danpion</hi> (as was ſaid) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting
much in ſolitudes, and ſoliloquies, one morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
walked forth with his Page into the Grove, where
through intenſneſs of mind, forgetting that he was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
he fell into a lamentation of his hopeleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and deſpairing affection, and through vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
of paſſion, at length giving liberty to his voice
to declare his ſorrows, ſomething louder than ordinary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
his words were retorted back to his ears by Eccho,
which <hi>Danpion</hi> hearing, minding not whence the
voice came, on a ſudden turned round, and eſpying his
Page, preſently entertained a conceit, it was he that
repeated his words, and ſo for his miſconceived ſaw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
gave him that correction, which being more
than his due, he with an ingrateful kind of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
reſolved to requite it, when opportunity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:52129:141"/>
And now fortune endeavouring like <hi>Penelope</hi> in a
night of black adverſity, to unweave that golden web
of happineſs, wherewith ſhe had hitherto inveſted
<hi>Danpion,</hi> incited this faithleſs Boys evil Genius, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
his mind with ſo much helliſh rancor, as to betray
his Lord, which he did to <hi>Baſcanius</hi>'s great ſatisfaction;
telling him how his Lord was in Love with <hi>Amphigenia,</hi>
and what means he uſed to gain her affection, and how
he once ſent him in the night into her Chamber, attired
like an Angel, with a pretended letter from <hi>Venus,</hi> and
what a ſecret paſſage he had through a crankling vault
to her Chamber, and many things ſo to <hi>Baſcanius</hi>'s
content, as that he gave him fifty Seſtercies, telling
him, my ſweet Boy (ſaid he) thou art my <hi>Paris,</hi> and I
accept this news from thee with higher reſentments,
than the <hi>Cytherean</hi> Queen on <hi>Ida</hi>'s top received the
golden Apple from the fair <hi>Trojan</hi> ſhepherd, and I
doubt not but by thy means to procure that <hi>Helena</hi> of
glory ſo courted by us, but yet by him raviſhed from
us. With theſe words they parted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Baſcanius</hi> being a man of an implacable malice, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining
at every beam of honor that ſhone from his
Peers, never allaying the ſurges of rage and envy, till
he had ſwallowed up his Competitors, a great ſuter to
fortune, and had obtained her for his Paramour, till
of late ſhe wedded her ſelf to <hi>Danpion,</hi> bringing with
her, her whole dowry of honor and riches, and every
thing elſe that makes her ſo deſirable, having thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
a paſſage to the haven of contentment, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ſince the wind blew ſo proſperouſly from ſuch a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the heavens, not to loſe the benefit of ſucceſs,
proffered him in the acceſs of ſo fit a means to procure
<hi>Danpions</hi> declenſion; but though he was rejected by
fortune, yet ſince he was thus courted by opportunity,
he would not ſlight its importunities. And being <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion</hi>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:52129:141"/>
was ſo great a Favourite, it was not therefore ſafe
for him to obey the violent impulſe of his inordinate
Paſſion, which prompted him to nothing, but preſent
ſatisfying of his Malice, that thirſted for <hi>Danpion</hi>'s im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
ruine; but rather to wake ſlowly, and ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
For having no other to teſtifie <hi>Danpion</hi>'s affection
to <hi>Amphigenia,</hi> but his Page, he feared, leſt if he ſhould
inconſiderately inform the King, without ſome more
pregnant confirmations of it, than his own, and the
Boyes bare affirmations, the King ſhould diſcern his
envy, and ſo the ruine he intended <hi>Danpion,</hi> might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
himſelf.</p>
            <p>And therefore to bring about his purpoſes, he intices
<hi>Kalapiſtus</hi> with promiſe of a moſt liberal reward, to
bring him thoſe clothes in which his Maſter was array<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

               </gap> on a day attires
himſelf in them, and watching his opportunity, when
<hi>Amphigenia</hi> was bathing her ſelf, he rudely ruſhes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Garden, and comes upon her juſt as ſhe was
come out of the ſilver ſtreams, which ſeemed to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
for her departure, having onely a rich thin mantle
caſt over her naked body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Baſcanius,</hi> who had never before beheld ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
contracted and united, could not but gaze
himſelf into admiration and aſtoniſhment, that he
thought her to be the very refined Elixar of all perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and every part of her a ſmall volume of all creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
excellencies in heaven or earth epitomiz'd, and
writ in golden Characters; he thought her to be ſome
incarnate Angel clad with a body compoſed of the
ſame quinteſſential matter with the heavens, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to ſuch a purity and even tranſparency, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
part ſeemed a burning mirror, wherein the Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
beams it incloſed were united, to the inflaming of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:52129:142"/>
all beholders, in fine ſhe ſeemed in a definite circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to ſet forth an infinite beauty, ſo that <hi>Baſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
ſtood a while even raviſhed with a ſtupefying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation,
as if he had loſt his ſoul in that world of
beauty, or as if all the faculties of his mind throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together to behold that wonder, had overwhelmed
each other.</p>
            <p>What ſhall I ſay? to deſcribe his unexpreſſible ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
were a task fitter for thoſe ſublime ſouls who
are acquainted with rapturous contemplations, and
know what it is to be ſnatcht into an extaſie. But oh,
the vehemence of <hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s paſſion, at this ſudden
ſurprizal! At firſt ſhe ſtood wondring rather whether
ſhe ſaw at all, than what ſhe ſaw, ſo that ſhe ſtood a
while even entranced with aſtoniſhment, but at length
awakned out of her dream of amazement, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
her ſelf for refuge to her leggs, and runs, and
ſhrieks, with ſuch a peircing ſhrilneſs, as the Air
ſeemed to hand her voice to the heavens, to implore
revenge for ſuch hideous preſumption; but as it fled the
Air ſeemed delighted with ſo ſweet a traveller, as it
bandyed it to and fro, as if each part was ambitious to
entertain it.</p>
            <p>The Ladies that were walking up and down in the
Gardens, ſome beheading flowers, to purifie their
brains with fragrant exhalations that ſteam from thoſe
neſts of ſweets, others ſumming up the riches of the

thus on a ſuddain their Lady ſhriek, preſently run
for her ſuccour, and at length they might ſee the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
nimbly tripping along upon the verdant Graſs,
which as proud to be depreſſed with ſo ſweet a foot,
would erect it ſelf with a pretty kind of ſtatelineſs,
after her departure, whilſt ſhe ran with ſo much ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:52129:142"/>
as even robbed their eyes of a plenary view of

of her, who no ſooner ſaw this beautiful train, but
he fled with as much celerity from them, as before he
did towards them, and hardly eſcaped ere the King
hearing a whole Conſort of ſhrieks and crys, among the
Ladies in the Garden, came with ſpeed to know the
cauſe, and found his daughter ſurrounded with her
Ladies, like <hi>Diana</hi> amongſt her Nymphs, ſo that ſhe
ſeemed like <hi>Sol</hi> among the Planets, where all beauty
center'd, theirs being onely reflections of hers.</p>
            <p>The King ſeeing that, called ſome of them to him,
to inform him of the reaſon of their outcries, who told
him, that <hi>Danpion</hi> (as was conjectured by his Garb)
had endeavoured to force the Lady <hi>Amphigenia; Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion</hi>
(ſaid the King) <hi>Danpion</hi> a raviſher! <hi>Danpion</hi> a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſher
of my daughter! oh monſtrous impiety! horrid

can never be. He who hath received ſuch tranſcend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Orient, or make the Sea vomit up her treaſures,
ſuch as though he would ſurrender up his ſoul it would
be too poor a reſtitution, and can it be, that he ſhould
attempt mine or my daughters diſhonor? heaven and
earth would conſpire their forces in avengement of ſuch
aſtoniſhing ingratitude. But if I find it true, by all the
Celeſtial powers, he had better have mounted on the
wings of his ambition to heaven and de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>This ſaid, the King in a fury returns to the Palace,
and baniſhes <hi>Danpion</hi> the Court, and confined him to
a houſe, ſome miles from the Palace, upon pain of
death at the leaſt attempt of liberty. <hi>Baſcanius</hi> ſeeing
ſuch a happy reſult of his plot, inwardly ſo ſwelled
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:52129:143"/>
with content, that he could not contain his venemous
rancor from burſting forth to the poiſoning of <hi>Danpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
honor, but privately gives forth ſcandalous libells,
and publikely teaches Fame the language of <hi>Danpions</hi>
diſgrace, which hitherto ſhe had been wholly unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with, and makes her declame on nothing but
the Theme of his luſt and ruine; and not contended
onely with this, but he relates at large to the King,
<hi>Danpions</hi> affection to <hi>Amphigenia,</hi> his former at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
to ſatiate (as he termed it) his libidinous deſires,
to which this late event ſtood as a teſt for confirmation.
And now all <hi>Danpions</hi> oppoſits in the Court, that had
born him inveterate malice, ſpurn at this muzled Lion,
and vent their malicious fumes to obſcure his luſtre.
Every one can lend a hand to thruſt down a tottering
Wall.</p>
            <p>Thus this innocent Prince was on the ſudden made
the ſubject of Fortunes hate, and his enemies malice,
and his new hatcht glory choaked by the black Ache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rontick

malignity.</p>
            <p>But now to tell you how this gallant and Princely

linke of time chains him as a ſlave to the Galley of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery

pairs of ſervil eyes that did attend his beck, is
now plundered of all ſtate, of all reſpect, unpittyed,
unregarded.</p>
            <p>But though miſery like <hi>Circes</hi> cup can thus meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſe
our externals, yet it can have no influence
on the rational part. None but caduque beings are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the tyranny of Time and Change; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
abſtracted beings, that come not under the predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament
of corporeity, as their eſſence, ſo their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is of an immutable permanency; and though
ſome abject ſouls that ſteep their Intellectuals in ſence,
and can reliſh nothing but Epicurean pleaſures, may
have their delights as tranſient as time, yet a compoſed
ſoul, truly fortified with Vertue, is its own deſtiny,
and depends not for its felicity on any other than
its own arbitrement, and that of an eternal Fate,
which guiding all things according to their natures,
conſequently rules free Agents, their Actions and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
happy or unhappy, as the former are attended
with Vertue or Vice, according to the principles it
hath placed within them, as its Vicegerents and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives
to govern them. Now ſuch a one miſeries
may try, cannot diſcompoſe or diſorder; ſuch a one no
revolution of time can drive from reſolution in the
midſt of extremities, and ſuch a one was <hi>Danpion.</hi> For
he ſeemed a man to whom whatever can merit the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thete
of Excellent might be attributed to him, having
a ſublime ſpirit in a matchleſs body; the former ſeemed
a ray of <hi>Prometheu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> fire, ſomething ratifyed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
with a more pure and active quality, not having
the leaſt mixture of thoſe ponde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>s elements that
clogg the mind, but all of rare aſcending fire, that
clarified his blood from thoſe feculent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>umors that flow
from the groſſier elements, and compoſed ſuch a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
in his ſoul, as no misfortune could make a jarr,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:52129:144"/>
and the latter was ſo ſweet a compoſition of all thoſe
maſculine graces that at once feed both delight and
wonder, as it ſeemed that Nature with Lilied beauty
had chalked out his ſoul a lodging proportionable to its
own greatneſs, and given him a body ſuitable to the
vigorous activity of his ſpirit.</p>
            <p>In fine, he that will give a perfect repreſentation of
the former, muſt not be raviſhed with an ordinary fury;
but his mind muſt be wholly purified from all droſſie
conceits; his fancy tarified and heightened with Ethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
fire, and his ſoul inſpired, actuated, and inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with a beam of Empyreal glory, which muſt form
ſublime fancys in it, as the Sun gives form to ſublunary
matter. And he that would give a true lively and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
draught of the latter, he muſt either fix his eyes on
ſome perſon, whoſe complexion, features and harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
hold ſome proportion with the delicacy, ſweetneſs
and grace, of which <hi>Danpions</hi> beauty was compoſed;
or elſe leave the ſoul of his love and paſs by tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration
into him, that ſo by that <hi>Idea</hi> love forms in the
mind, to copy out ſome imperfect adumbration of his
perfections; but the one being unlikely, and the other
impoſſible, renders the Painter unable.</p>
            <p>Now what inundation of miſery could overwhelm
ſo great a ſpirit, which like a rich mount of Oar, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to bid defiance to the turbulent waves of Fortune?
That that did moſt ſtrongly invade his breaſt, was the
remembrance of the loſs of <hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s favour; and
that indeed compelled him to let his ſorrow diſſolve in
drops, and to indulge himſelf to melting paſſions.
One while hee'd huſh his griefs with eaſie ſighes, as if
they whiſpered in his liſtning ear the pleaſing news of
<hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s pitty; and then each groan would ſeem
a note of Love, and with thoſe raptures hee'd lye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranc'd
a while.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:52129:144"/>
Thus ſubtilly did ſorrow inſinuate it ſelf into his
heart, by coming hid under a bait of pleaſure. But
then a deep fetcht ſigh would tell him roundly in his
ear, thoſe pleaſing dreams were but deluſions; then
grief would change the former <hi>Phrygian</hi> harmony, in
his thoughts to the <hi>Dorick</hi> tone, compoſed of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſtrains and doleful airs, where every note ſounds
like a groan, and every quaver like the trembling ſigh
of one that weeps; And then a flowing Sea of ſorrow
would ſupply his eyes with tears, which ſoftly trickling
down his cheeks would ſeem to draw a Map of grief in
his face; here Iſlands inhabited with ſweets and graces,
and their Garden filled with Roſes and Lilies; here a
lake of liquid Pearls, and there a briny ſtream ſoftly
kiſſing his cheeks. Then he would even break out to
curſing <hi>Baſcanius</hi> and his Pages treachery, but then
<hi>Amphigenia</hi> would fill his thoughts, and make him
break off abruptly, as he broke out paſſionately. At
length eſpying a Lute that hung behind the hangings in
a corner of the chamber, he took it down; and made it
diſcourſe his griefs in ſuch melting accents, as every
note ſeemed to flye gently into the ſtill entrance of his
charmed ear, and intrance him with a ſoft pleaſing paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
ſometimes it would ſeem even to ſteal his very
ſoul and impriſon it in the Lute; the anti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>athies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the chirping Trebles, and the grumbling Baſe,
being ſo ſweetly reconciled by the mean, as ſeemed in
Muſicks language, to teach him Vertues mediocrity.
But he making no other commentary on it, than that
of grief, would think the quavering ſtrings did tremble
at his ſorrows, and the Lutes heart-diſſolving airs to
ſigh forth the lamentations of his unfortunate but paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
love, in ſuch ſympathizing ſtrains, as made him
almoſt think the ſpirit of ſome unhappy Lover had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up its <hi>Elizium</hi> in its belly, and there in ſilent
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:52129:145"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ones breathed forth his woes, which the trembling
ſtrings in imitation of Fame would ſeem to eccho to his
ears; and then laying his mouth to the carved Navel
of the Lutes ſweet womb, he would call aloud, If any
Lovers ſoul by tranſmigration dwells within this little
cell of pleaſure, let him come forth and tune his groans
to mine, and we will charm our ſorrows, and ſtop the
Spheres, who liſtning to our tones may not whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le our
woful fates ſo faſt upon us, and bribe the Deſtinies to
cancel their decrees; but then nothing but a hollow
ſound would give reply to his words, as 'twere to ſhew,
what little ſubſtantial comfort ſuch any conceipts affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
It is not ſo eaſie to ſtanch a Lovers bleeding
heart.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing the Lute refuſed to coffin up his woes, he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lings it down, and takes his Pen and Inke, and fain
would wrap up his griefs in the winding ſheet of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which embalmed in tears he would ſend to <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phigenia</hi>
to bury them in her pittying thoughts. And
that each ſentence might more lively expreſs his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
hee'd ſteep every letter in a tear; but then the
letters as not able to ſwim on the briny drops, would
ſink into the tear-bedabled-paper, and as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> were drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in ſorrow would loſe their forms, and rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
a monſtrous draught of horror.</p>
            <p>Then he would fling away his paper, as not fit to
contain the name of <hi>Amphigenia;</hi> and toſſe his pen,
which would ſeem to weep for its neglect, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprinkle
the wall with its tears; tears that clad in black,
ſeemed as dark mirors, or the quinteſſential extracts
of ſorrow; where each Globe-like-drop, that trund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
among the duſt, ſeemed a little bottle that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a livelyer reſemblance of griefs Elixar, than
<hi>Danpion</hi> coul diſtil out of his brain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:52129:145"/>
But then he would take it again and write, and blot,
and enter-line; here he thought the expreſſion was too
flat, and there too full of big-ſounding, bum-baſte words,
containing more ſyllables, than ſenſe, and fuller of
noiſe, than reaſon; and not like the Amber-phraſes,
wherein witty Lovers dreſs their Paſſions, where any
Love-ſchooled eye, in every clear conceit may deſcry
<hi>Cupid</hi> plac'd, as in a Cryſtal ſhrine: Then he would
condemn his wit, which now would ſeem too barren,
then ſo full of unlickt fancies, as their number would
choak their grace, and render his Style an indigeſted
maſs of ſenſe-confounding-nonſenſe, and not like thoſe
quick lively raptures, begotten by the wanton Boy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Invention, which ſo reſemble their Father, as
ſeem to be his perfect Picture; and no ſooner born, than
borne on his Wings, out of the view of vulgar eyes.
Then he would bid fie on his Genius, that now
ſhould fill his head with nothing but Barbariſms, when
his brain had more need been a Florilegium of ſublime
Stories; a Store-houſe of acute Metaphors, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> up in every

               </gap> in mind of
<hi>Amphigenia,</hi> and then he would blame his Tongue for
its unpardonable preſump<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion, to mention with the
leaſt deteſtation, any thing that had but the ſhadow
of an Image of that, that might be call'd hers.</p>
            <p>Thus did his ſorrow variouſly vent it ſelf, having none
to commiſerate him, but the ſenſleſs Walls, (which
with a dull noiſe, would repeat his moans, and ſay <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
to his cryes) and the Marble of the Chimney, which
would weep and ſweat, as 't were with ſympathizing
pain; but grief would transform the Form of every
thing, that had the ſhape of comfort, and make the
Walls echo his groans, with a ſad dolefulneſs, and the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:52129:146"/>
Marble drops to reflect his viſage, and therein the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture
of ſorrow. True grief delights in ſolitudes,
if it may be ſaid to have any delight; and he mourns
with a witneſs, that mourns without a witneſs.</p>
            <p>But now, to leave him in his lamentations, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to <hi>Amphigenia,</hi> who with the fright ſhe took at
her ſurprizal, fell into ſuch a dangerous diſtemper, as
threatned little leſs than her ſudden diſſolution; every
moment the fatal Thief, would ſteal ſome portion of her
Roſy-excellence, or rather the Graces enſhrined in her
beautious Face, by a myſterious tranſition paſſed into
my ſoul, to make her fit to inhabit among the Celeſtial
dwellers; which when her Father ſaw, he grew ſo
enraged with <hi>Danpion,</hi> as he reſolved not to be partial,
but gave ſtrict command to his Keeper, that night to
put out his eyes, as others before had ſuffered for an
offence of the like kind, though without thoſe high
aggravations that attended his: and moreover, to keep
him Priſoner, until they ſaw whether <hi>Amphigenia</hi>
would recover, or not; if not, he ſhould be ſacrificed
on her Tomb, and her Epitaph ſhould be written in
his Aſhes, and engraven with the point of a Sword on
his Skull; but if the contrary, he ſhould have his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>The Jailor, to execute the Kings commands, in
the depth and dead of all the night, ſoftly ſteals up to
<hi>Danpion</hi>'s chamber, whom care and ſorrow, and a
ſtrange noiſe of confuſed thoughts, would not permit
to ſleep, ſo that he was only laid down on his bed, a
little wax Taper burning by him, and was reading the
ſad ſtory of <hi>Hero</hi> and <hi>Leander</hi>'s love, and was ſo moved
with its woful concluſion, as that he could not but
ſhed ſome drops on the Book, and by drowning their
names with Tears, make them act over again their own
Tragedy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:52129:146"/>
The Keeper perceiving a dim light in his Chamber,
(which gave him to ſee his hopes to take him aſleep
were vaniſhed) ruſhes in violently with a naked Sword
in his hand, and with all the terror a deformed coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
(expreſſing more horror in a gaſtly look, than
could be otherwiſe contained in a Volume) could
frame, he delivers the meſſage, and commands him
to ſubmit with patience, as he expected to meet with
better uſage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Danpion</hi> hearing this unexpected tidings, fixed his
eye undauntedly upon him, whoſe Majeſty might
have ſtruck an awful terror into the moſt ruthleſs Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains
heart, and enraged more with the churliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his ſpeech, than with the terribleneſs of his
meſſage, he, with a reſolute fury, leaps upon the Jaylor,
and on the ſudden writhes the ſword out of his hand,
and redeems himſelf, giving him blowes for his Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom.
Extremity is Vertues Opportunity, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
appears clad with greater luſtre, than when ſtript
naked by Fortune.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Danpion</hi> having releaſed himſelf, runs to a near ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
Wood, where he ſpends that night in ſighing
forth his woes; ſomtimes raving at the Kings mercileſs
tyranny, ſomtimes curſing <hi>Baſcanius</hi>'s treachery, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
lamenting <hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s cruelty. His Mind float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a tempeſtuous Sea of thoughts, would be wreck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſomtimes upon Rocks of inſuperable difficulties,
ſomtimes overwhelmed in a Gulf of deſpair: Then his
Tongue, the ſervant of his Mind, to give ſome little
eaſe, would vent ſome ſtreams, out of the over-flowings
of his thoughts. Words are airy ſucceſſors to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtate
comforts: Flitting Shadows, and vaniſhing
Pictures of our mindes, or our mindes transformed into
Air, and that formed into Words; inviſible tranſcripts
of our thoughts, writ upon Air, and copyed out by our
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:52129:147"/>
Tongues; poor breathing Orators of our woes, whoſe
Rhetorick will for a while huſh them to ſilence; who
give eaſe, though they give no ſuccour.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Danpion,</hi> with the wind of his words, would a
little diſperſe the Clouds of grief in his mind. Somtimes
he would inveigh againſt Envy, calling it the putrid
Blain of a corrupt mind, or the very Impoſthume of all
vitious humours; which burſting with its own venom,
ſends forth an infectious gore, called Slaunder: Slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that baſe canker of Renown, filthy vapour of an
ulcerous mind, whoſe ſteam obſcures Vertues bright
Ray; vile demoliſher of the Temple of Honour, and
the accurſed ſpawn of a helliſh mind.</p>
            <p>But then his Hate to Envy, would bring to his mind
the contrary oppoſite, a Love to Vertue; and both theſe
would be as alarms, to awaken the thoughts of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phigenia,</hi>
the Object of the firſt, and the Subject of the
latter; And then he would condemn his too too ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturous
eyes, for their preſumptuous beholding of
that miracle of beauty; but more his remembrance, for
retaining that Soul-captivating Species, her Idea; but
moſt of all, his Heart, for ſurrendring up its Cittadel to
the tyranny of love.</p>
            <p>And then he would call out, Ah! Why did I love?
Alas! alas! Why did I love? Thus to be made a
ſlave to Beauty; but how could I chuſe but love? love?
nay adore ſo Divine a Form? Rather why do I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber?
ſince it is remembrance that is the life of my
grief, and that that renews my woes; but how can I
chuſe but remember ſuch a heavenly ſhape, in whom
all unparalleld Excellencies meet like parallels in their
proper Centre; whoſe every beam glanced from her
eyes, writ a compleat ſtory in my mind, of Beauties
Perfection, and Loves Prerogative? But ah! Why did
I then give liberty to my eyes to ſee that model of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:52129:147"/>
perfections? ſince the eyes are the Cryſtal doors
of the mind, at which all Objects enter that enthrall
the affections; but alas! who could but gaze, and gaze
himſelf to admiration, and admire himſelf into an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie,
to behold one, in whoſe Eye lay the diapazon of
beauties viſible harmony, which with their motions,
like the Spheres, would ſtrike Entrancing Raptures into
all chaſt hearts; and where thouſands of Stars lay
couched under a ſable Veil, reſembling nights Canopy,
whoſe rapting influence, would compel all eyes to ſee,
all thoughts to remember, and all hearts to love and
adore?</p>
            <p>Thus his thoughts flying from one oppoſite to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
would ſtill centre on <hi>Amphigenia;</hi> like the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles,
that flying from Eaſt to VVeſt, met in <hi>Delphos;</hi>
and thus he conſumed the night, untill about the dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the morn; that impartially partial hour, which
whileſt it ſeems to ſtand as a Neuter, between night
and day, and to take to neither, doth indeed incline to
both; when remembring, that though his eſcape had
freed him from preſent miſery, yet not from future ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine,
he therefore reſolved to flee to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> after his
friend <hi>Periander,</hi> and aſſiſt him in the releaſment of
<hi>Glycera,</hi> and then return with him to <hi>Theſſalia,</hi> and by

not but to procure a conſiderable Party that ſhould
revolt from <hi>Hiarbas,</hi> upon the leaſt knowledge of his

            <p>As he was thus walking and pondering, there ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
came upon him about five Horſmen, who by
force (he having no weapon to defend himſelf) car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
him about the ſpace of a mile, to a green Valley,
where there lay great numbers of Souldiers, as in a Buſh;
in the midſt of whom, was a rich <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, drawn by four
milk-white Horſes abreaſt, wherein there ſat a moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:52129:148"/>
Lady, clad in rich attire, in whoſe face was
diſplayed all the Enſignes and Trophaes of conquering
beauty, and in her looks there ſat not only an attractive
ſweetneſs, but a Majeſtick ſtatelineſs; ſo that ſhe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at once to allure and command affection, to behold,
conquer, and tryumph: So that <hi>Caeſars</hi> Motto, <hi>Veni,
vidi, vici,</hi> tranſlated into the language of Love, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
written on every feature, in the Roſie-Characters
of beauty.</p>
            <p>In this tryumphant poſture ſhe rode, four Virgins
that were her Attendants, ſitting at her feet, a proper
Gentleman, all in Armour, well mounted, riding by
her as a captive to her beauty; whoſe ſoul peeping
thorow the Priſon-windows of his eyes, plainly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
it ſelf to be fettered with the Beams that came
from hers. To this Gentleman they carried <hi>Danpion,</hi>
who no ſooner ſaw him, but he diſ-mounted, and ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him with all the teſtimonies of reſpect and honour,
an innate civility, together with a true grounded af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and a juſt reſpect, founded upon great worth,
all meeting in one Perſon, could poſſibly diſpoſe him
to utter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Danpion</hi> amazed with this unexpected manner of
encounter, and the more amazed, becauſe ſo unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
was at firſt (contrary to his wonted manner of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deep engagements upon others, with his unimita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
courteſie) carried with aſtoniſhment to that extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
that borders on the confines of Incivility; till at
length, called out of his amazement, with exceſs of
amazement, (as waters chilneſs recalls the ſpirits) he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torts
back his ſalutation, with the like manner of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
and craving pardon for his rudeneſs, requeſts
him therein to accuſe his bad fortunes, who rendring
him unworthy to chalenge, had alſo baniſhed all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
to meet with any ſuch honour; and withall,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:52129:148"/>
condemning his memory, that could retain his ſorrows,
but not the name and Idea of a Perſon of ſo much
worth. The Gentleman hearing this told him, that
his name was <hi>Athalus,</hi> who, that his actions might be
of an equal latitude with his promiſes, he, with ſome
few men, came to ſerve him in the attaining of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Danpion</hi> called to mind, that this was the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that came with <hi>Periander</hi> to the Hermits Cave,
and alſo what engagements he made at his parting from
thence, and thereupon embraced him with all poſſible
joy, and gave him Millions of thanks for his oblige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
telling him, how ſeaſonable his aſſiſtance came,
and therewithall fully informing him of his condition,
and what Plots he had uſed, and what ſucceſs of his
Plots, and what advantage by that ſucceſs, and in
what ſtate and poſture his affairs were in for the preſent;
how much weakned by the ſudden departure of <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
whoſe counſel and aſſiſtance had exceedingly
farthered his Deſignes: And then he told him of <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>'s
happy meeting with <hi>Florinda,</hi> and by what
wile ſhe had eſcaped from <hi>Acaſtus;</hi> neither did he
ſtick to tell him of his own affection to <hi>Amphigenia,</hi>
though neither by his manner of ſpeech, countenance,
or geſture, did he accuſe in himſelf any ſuch Paſſion;
not like thoſe puny Lovers, who can coyn no expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
but in the Mint-houſe of Paſſion; and when they
ſpeak, their ſpeech is nothing but a bundle of incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities,
and incohaerent Phraſes, and all the while their
<hi>April</hi>-faces muſt now moiſten the ground with a
ſhowr of Tears, anon the clouds of grief muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed,
and nothing but ſerenity; and thus by exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
inconſtancy, deſcribing their inward conſtancy.
But then <hi>Danpion</hi> began to enquire of <hi>Athalus,</hi> about
the event of his love to <hi>Matilda</hi> (for <hi>Periander,</hi> as they
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:52129:149"/>
came along from the Hermitage, had told him the
whole ſtory) and whether that excellent Lady, that
beautified the Coach with her Beauty, were not ſhe:
To whom <hi>Athalus</hi> replyed, that that indeed was the
Lady, that was the Pole-ſtar of all his endeavours,
through whoſe favour he breathed, through whoſe
breath he lived, through the life of whoſe love he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his life, and by which he poized all his felicity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Danpion</hi> having performed his ſalutations to her, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalus</hi>
began his relation. It hapned (ſaid he) that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the time my wounds were healing in the Cave,
where firſt it was my happineſs to meet with your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<hi>Plirio</hi> (through whoſe means <hi>Periander</hi> and I
were ſet upon, by the Villains that dragged us into
thoſe Woods, with intents to kill us) became Lord of
<hi>Parrhaſia,</hi> by the death of his Father; he being the
only preſerver of his name, was left the only Poſſeſſor
of his Lordſhip; who having now ability to execute
what only before he had wickedneſs to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ire, hoping
that both of us, but eſpecially my ſelf, had taſted the
fruit of his baſe revenge, ſeizes upon my Caſtle in my
abſence, under pretence of a forfeiture for Treaſons,
Murders, and Conſpiracies ſaid to be acted and ploted
by me and my Complices. And that he might co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
over theſe unjuſt pretences, with pretences of
Juſtice, he cauſed thoſe that eſcaped from <hi>Periander</hi>
by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>light, after they had acted their bloody Tragedy
upon me, vehemently to petition for juſtice againſt me;
who being men not only of murderous, but mercenary
ſpirits, and never would refuſe to dive into a Sea of
wickedneſs, to find that Pearl called Gain, and ever
thought it the greateſt piece of folly in the world, for
men to recede from their own Intereſt, through a
childiſh dread of impiety, and to be affrighted from
the beaten rode of Vice, if it leads to a Mine of wealth,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:52129:149"/>
with the fooliſh Bug-bear terrors that haunt that path;
and therefore they'd no leſs deride at thoſe, that not
ſteering their actions by the compaſs of Profit, would
ſail where ever thoſe guſts of popular breath entituled
Honor ſhould drive them; than a skillful experienced
Mariner would at a freſh-water Seaman, that neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Compaſs, ſhould flatter himſelf with hopes of a
ſpeedy arrival at his Port, becauſe he runs afore the
wind, though it blow from a quite contrary quarter.
Theſe men being thus a fit matter for him to ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
any form upon, he transforms their former ſhapes,
and makes them become of lovers to Vice, pretended
lovers of Vertue; and therefore deſirous of juſtice, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
not only becauſe it was juſtly ranked in the catalogue of
Vertues, but becauſe it was the deſtroyer of Vice, and
the cheriſher and protector of Vertue</p>
            <p>And this he did to obſcure his own malice, and their
revenge, from the popular view; that ſo his actions ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an image of juſtice impreſſed upon them, might
paſs current.</p>
            <p>Having thus by policy and ſubtilty, plundered me
of my eſtate, the next thing he had to do was to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
himſelf of <hi>Arriteſia,</hi> without whom all the other
iſſues of his brain would prove abortive; and to that
end he invites both the ſiſters <hi>Arriteſia</hi> and <hi>Matilda,</hi>
(to intercept all jealouſies in them or their Father, that
might intercept his plot) to a moſt magnificent feaſt,
where (as was reported) luxury and exceſs ſeemed to
ride in triumph in every diſh, as though the ſtorehouſes
of the elements had been ranſacked to furniſh his
Table; as if he had been rather to have courted his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſſes
appetite, than her affection; ſo that his Table
ſeemed the Scene of Prodigality, whereon was acted
the Tragedy of Temperance and true Liberalty; the
moſt poinant meats being poiſons to the former,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:52129:150"/>
as exceſſive profuſeneſs is deſtructive to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>But the Feaſt being concluded, <hi>Plivio</hi> had another
play to act, to which this ſerved but for a Prologue;
and that was to ſeize upon <hi>Arriteſia;</hi> that ſince (as the
Philoſopher ſaith) every one is the framer of his own
fate, he reſolved that none ſhould accuſe his negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
for his infelicity, but he would purchaſe that by
compulſion, to which milder means he ſaw would
prove ineffectual. For (my Lord) you muſt know <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riteſia</hi>
was a Lady in whom appeared all the delicate
attractives of beauty, and external demonſtrations of
internal Vertue; ſo that as the former would ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
excuſe a Stoick ſhould he become an amoriſt:
excuſe? nay accuſe him of a baſe ignorance of worth,
ſhould he not admire her perfections; ſo the influence
of the latter, might have created goodneſs in the worſt
of men, and rendered him inexcuſable in whoſe breaſt
was the leaſt ſpark of an impure fire. Now no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if a vertuous ſoul enſhrined in ſo ſweet a body, by
a reflex act viewing its own internal beauty, be like
<hi>Narciſſus</hi> gazing on his picture limned by the Sun-beams
in a Fountain, enamoured with its own excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies;
and ſo was <hi>Arriteſia,</hi> yet not ſo as to obſcure
her worth, with being void of humility, but rather
made Humility a means to diſcover the worthineſs of
her worth, and ſo her Vertues as they became more
perſpicuous, ſo more delectable; ſo that if her humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
was apt to entice hope, her dazling worth would
again ſtupiſie and confound it. But as none can caſt
up their eyes at the Sun, with more confidence, and leſs
dazling, than the blind; ſo none are leſs raviſhed with
true worth, than thoſe whoſe ignorance of it, makes
them leaſt admire it.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Plivio,</hi> though none had leſs grounds for hope,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:52129:150"/>
yet none had greater confidence than he; not becauſe
he ſo far excelled others, as that his tranſcending de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts
ſhould excite her to pitch upon him, but becauſe
his worth being ſhort of many, made him leſs able to
diſcern of anothers, and begat conceits of himſelf
above what his deſerts could challenge, and ſuch
thoughts in any will ſoon augment hope to a preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but this did but create the more diſeſteemes of
him in <hi>Arriteſia</hi>'s thoughts, who by the light of her
own worth was able to ſee his worthleſneſs, and where
diſeſteem once gets entrance, its hard to crowd out
diſaffection, they being inſeparably linked together, as
love and contempt are irreconcileably ſeparated; ſo
that <hi>Arriteſia</hi> thus ſlighting his perſon would much
more contemn his importunings, that ſhe let all his
words dye in their own ſounds, his moſt pathetick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
taking no more impreſſion on her, than puffs
of Air upon an Adamant.</p>
            <p>Her mind was a Paradiſe, where ſwarmed Angels of
high thoughts, ſuch thoughts as each deſerved a
Crown, and could he think ſuch thoughts would admit
of ſociety with ſo mean and abject meditations as his
imaginary Vertues? But whither doth my paſſion tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
me! <hi>Plivio</hi> finding her thus (as he tearmed her)
an obſtinate piece, bent his wit more to deviſe ſome
ſtratagem, how to procure her by the favour of policy,
than before he did to compoſe his ſmooth courting
ſpeeches to ſtorm her by the force of eloquence. And
having by that ſubtilty enticed her to his Caſtle (as I
told you) after the Feaſt was concluded, and the ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ceremonies to them both to delay their ſudden depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but eſpecially to <hi>Arriteſia,</hi> to whom he applies
himſelf in all the dilatory poſtures of a parling Lover;
ſo that <hi>Matilda</hi> by this time was entered into her
Coach, and all their attendants ſtood without, waiting
when <hi>Plivio</hi> would diſmiſs their Lady, whoſe ear was
ſurfeited with his tedious complements. But <hi>Plivio</hi>
having now brought about what he deſired, thought it
not prudence to dally with opportunity, but on the
ſuddain gives the watch-word to his ſervants, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to interpret the meaning, make faſt the Gate,
and by force drew in <hi>Arriteſia</hi> into the Caſtle, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
her pittiful ſhrieks and crys, and tears, able to
wound the flintyeſt heart, and peirce the moſt impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable
ears. Oh! that heaven ſhould ever permit any
to fix the ſuperſcription of love, upon actions ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
viſible to the dimmeſt eye, to be nothing but the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprings
of a luxurious paſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Matilda,</hi> with the company that were without,
hearing <hi>Arriteſia</hi>'s crys, and ſeeing the ſad effects of
his plot, and that his former delays were but the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of occaſion, they in a confuſed manner run
home to <hi>Pirotes</hi>'s houſe, to inform him of his Daughters
ſurprizal; but as they went, amazing fear had ſo diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
ſome, and fearleſs amazement tranſported others,
that when <hi>Pirotes</hi> at their arrival (having his heart no
leſs filled with terror, than his ears were with the noiſe
of that rout) inquired of them the cauſe of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
as the one (at firſt) could not tell what to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
ſo neither could the other tell how to deliver their
doleful meſſage, but made their countenances ſupply
the defects of their ſpeech; till at length they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the villany of <hi>Plivio,</hi> and the miſery of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:52129:151"/>
               <hi>Pirotes,</hi> whoſe ears with ſuch greedy haſte hunted for
words, had now over-taken the prey that preyed upon
him, and pulling his hat over his face (as I was told)
tears fell in ſuch abundance, as if his heart diſſolved
into drops, had diſtilled thorough his eyes; ſuch a
ſource of ſorrow did over-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>low him, as even drowned
his ſenſes, and with too much ſenſe of grief, made
grief become ſenſeleſs. Sorrow when it ſwells above
the dam of moderation confounds it ſelf.</p>
            <p>In this confuſed conflict of mind, he fixes this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
in his thoughts (if an unſteadfaſt mind, float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the inconſtant waves of grief, can ever be ſaid to
reſolve) that a few womaniſh complaints ſhould not
ſatisfie his revenge, but he would give the coyn that
<hi>Mars</hi> uſes to purchaſe Kingdoms with for her
Dowry.</p>
            <p>The next day, according to his reſolution, he ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
all his Tenants together; and as many as tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
either envy or hatred to <hi>Plivio,</hi> or love to <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſia</hi>

whoſe merits far over-ballanced his, though his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
exceeded theirs) would appear in arms againſt
him, and beſieges him in his Caſtle before his ſpies could
give any information; ſo that all his preparations were
to fight <hi>Cupids</hi> battels, for inſtead of that miſcellany of
noiſes and combuſtions that are the uſual effects of
ſudden alarms, they might hear nothing but Muſick
and dancing, and all things that argued a fearleſs ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity;

            <p>Thus many times, ſome unthought of miſchief ſteals

benummed with a dream of pleaſure, and ſeldom that

any that move upon the ſtill waters of content, but
like that inauſpicious meteor called <hi>Helena,</hi> it preſages
a ſtorm.</p>
            <p>And ſo it was with <hi>Plivio,</hi> he was reaping the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
of delight with one hand, whilſt he ſowed the
ſeeds of his own ruin with the other. And had not
the Gates been happily faſtned (thanks more to his
good fortune than his vigilance) he had been ſurprized
in the midſt of all his jollity; but by that means they
were forced to uſe ſcaling Ladders, battering Rams,
and other Engines of War, to force a paſſage into the
Caſtle. And ſo ſtrongly was it fortified by Art and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that notwithſtanding they were interrupted with
ſo ſmall reſiſtance, as onely from ſome few of <hi>Plivio</hi>'s
menial attendants, that were more beholding to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for valour than their Maſter, and had made what
oppoſition, men grown deſperate with courage and
neceſſity would dare to attempt, yet ſucceſs had not put
a period to their enterprize, untill the ſetting of the Sun
had concluded the day. And juſt then (as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ortune
would have it) it was my happineſs to arrive at the
Caſtle, to the admiration of <hi>Pirotes</hi> and all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
who before were fully poſſeſſed with the belief
of my death. But after ſome congratulations that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
betwixt us, he gave me a full information of the
reaſons of his proceedings, and what had been
<hi>Plivio</hi>'s deſigns in my abſence, and how that fate that
commonly attends ſuch actions, had now diſſipated all
his endeavors.</p>
            <p>The whilſt he held me in this diſcourſe, the reſt of
the men were ranſacking the Caſtle for <hi>Plivio</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riteſia,</hi>
the one the onely prey for their revenge, and
the latter the onely treaſure they ſought after: but
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:52129:152"/>
notwithſtanding all the care and diligence that could
be expected in men ſearching for a Jewel, that muſt ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
them from the killing tortures of a living death,
not the leaſt footſteps of either could be found. But
how, or when, or which way, or whither they eſcaped,
was as great a ſubject of our admiration, as if the Sun
had droped down from heaven. But I ſhall never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
how the good old man, when the news of his

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lew to his ears, how he at once both
wept and wondered, grief and aſtoniſhment having
both taken the Fortreſs of his heart, and both at once
diſplayed their Banners in his countenance, and there
I ſaw at once an agreement betwixt them to tyrannize
over him, and a diſagreement about dominion over
each other; his amazement did at once tranſport him
and confound grief, his grief would at once overflow
him and drown his amazement.</p>
            <p>But at length after a tedious ſearch for <hi>Arriteſia,</hi> for
whom they looked with more curioſity than <hi>Ceres</hi> did
for <hi>Proſerpina,</hi> and the time of night being come, that
is wont to ſteal our ſenſes, and hide them in a <hi>Pando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>'s
box of dreams, <hi>Pirotes</hi> returned home (for home
he would return) though (as common civility obliged)
I much preſſed him to the contrary. But as he went
(poor Gentleman) methoughts I ſaw a doleful hearſe
of ſorrow in his looks, his heavy eyes with their dim
lights pointing towards <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he ground, as if there he
meant to inhabit next, and ſeemed like torches in a

            <p>But to be ſhort, ſorrow had ſo cloſed up all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries

thing that ſeemed an enemy to mourning, ſo that he
converſed with nothing but ſolitaryneſs, ſaw nothing
but darkneſs, heard nothing but inward ſighs, ſpake
nothing but ſilent moans, felt nothing but pangs that
ſtupified his feeling, and taſted nothing but inſipid
grief, till at length death that unties the Gordian knots
of nature, that untunes the harmony of compounded
beings; the poor mans wiſh, the rich mans fear, the
ſad mans joy, the ſtout mans Page, the young mans

               </gap>oy, and the old mans expectation; that thief that
ſteals man away, and leaves his picture for a while,
ſtole <hi>Pirotes</hi> out of this world, who amongſt many
other grave counſels to <hi>Matilda</hi> (the rare off-ſprings of
thoſe ſevere but excellent thoughts, that ſteam forth
from a departing ſoul, carried above it ſelf with that
exceſs of joy extracted from thoſe pleaſureable medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that a well-paſſed life in this world do afford) I
ſay much and ſo excellent advice he gave her, as if he
would have contracted the former goodneſs of the
whole ſpan of his life into a punctum, of all his years
into that laſt moment, and then like the laſt blaze of an
Aromatick Torch, breath forth the fragrant odors of
his life in his laſt inſtant; and then my good Angel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
him with ſuch high thoughts of me, as (indeed)
it would be the greateſt preſumption to think my merits
could challenge a farr inferior reputation: So that at
his laſt hour he charged her, that if ever (as he pleaſed
to tearm it) ſo much happineſs was reſerved for her, as
that I ſhould pitch upon her as the object of my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
not to be ſo great an enemy to her ſelf (he might
more properly have ſaid an enemy to me) as to ſlight
me, though my ſmall worth might be a ſufficient excuſe,
having nothing that might merit the contrary, except
in that I love her; but however, this was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:52129:153"/>
freſh remembrance of his death was a little withered
(as nothing ever continues verdant, though farr be it
from me to expunge the remembrance of him, 'twould
be an eternal blot to my name, and might juſtly make
me remembred onely for infamy) but I ſay, after the
verdant freſhneſs of it, though watered with the dew
of many tears, began to decay, I went to <hi>Matilda,</hi>
and unbreaſted my thoughts to her, and diſcloſed the
beauteous image of her ſelf there incloſed; and how
pure a flame was ſhot from her eyes into my heart, and
in a broken manner (for ſuch is the language of Lovers,
the commotions of their hearts diſturbing their ſpeech)
I ſay brokenly I begged of her to love me, if not for
my own ſake, yet as the Cabinet of ſuch a Jewel as
her Idea, and if not for that, yet for her Fathers ſake,
who had bequeathed ſo excellent a Legacy unto me as
her ſelf, the Jewel of the world, the pattern of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
in whoſe preſence all beauties loſe their
luſtre, as the Suns refulgent beams drown the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
of the Stars; and in compariſon of whom <hi>Venus</hi>
was but a blowze, and might juſtly be accuſed of
the higheſt arrogance, ſhould ſhe account her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
worth eſtimation when compared with
hers.</p>
            <p>In fine, I left nothing unſaid that Love could dictate
(and Love did dictate as much as can be within the
compaſs of invention) ſo that at length with theſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults
I battered down all thoſe reaſons that fortified her
heart againſt me; and forced her to bluſh forth a dumb
conſent, when methoughts I ſaw her former thoughts
marching out of her mind with the colours flying in the
lovely Air of her countenance, with ſuch a delicate
bravery, as ſhe ſeemed at once to yield and tryumph;
ſo that I became o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a captive a victor, but yet ſuch a
victor, as my conqueſt did but augment my captivity.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:52129:154"/>
And before ſhe would ſurrender up her heart to my
poſſeſſion, ſhe compelled me by many Vows to ſwear,
not to deface her ſpotleſs Vertue, but that chaſtity
ſhould retain its governance; and withall to pay a large
ſum of merits, towards the building a Temple of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
where her Vertue ſhould lye enſhrined; and
ſince that no deſerts purchaſe greater renown, than
thoſe that are founded on Valour and Deeds of Arms,
therefore ſhe engaged me to travel with her thorough
<hi>Greece</hi> to hunt for fame with heroick exploits. And
remembring that there was no better way to eternize
my name, than to ſerve ſo excellent a Prince as your
ſelf, in ſo juſt and honorable a cauſe, I raiſed what
forces I could in <hi>Parrhaſia,</hi> and am now come to obey
<hi>Matilda,</hi> and ſerve your Lordſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Athalus</hi> having thus finiſhed his ſtory, <hi>Danpion</hi> and
he began to conſult about their deſigns. Great affairs
being ſurrounded with difficulties, for their better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment,
require as well <hi>Argus</hi>'s eyes as
<hi>Briarcus</hi> hands. And therefore as a Prince would
proclame himſelf guilty of no great prudence, whoſe
confidence on anothers judgement ſhould create in
him a diffidence of his own, and by that means make
another the <hi>Atlas</hi> of his Crown; ſo neither would it
argue height of policy, ſhould an over-valuing opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of himſelf, beget in him a contempt of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel:
For by that means, viewing his reaſons thorough
the ſpectacles of ſelf-conceipt, be ſure they will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
(however empty in themſelves) more full of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
more forcible, and more demonſtrative than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
That Prince had need have a brain pregnant
with <hi>Minerva</hi> that needs no co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nſel, as he ſhews him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a Prince (ſcarce a man I ſhould ſay) with a head,
empty of brains, that refuſes all counſel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:52129:154"/>
But to digreſs from this digreſſion. <hi>Pandion</hi> and
<hi>Athalus</hi> (as I ſaid) fell into conſultation about the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aging
this cauſe in which they were embarqued, and
how to ſteer it ſafely to the Port of Soveraignty. Now
in all determinable caſes, controverted by a Councel,
theſe three points are chiefly to be inſiſted on.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Juſtneſs of the cauſe: for who can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to return crowned with a Lawrel, that at once
fightt againſt the powers of heaven and earth?</p>
            <p>Secondly, The facility of accompliſhing; and
therein is to be conſidered the inſtrumental cauſes: for
never was any ſo in league with Heaven, as to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
ſupernatural aſſiſtance. None could free him
from the imputation of madneſs, that would endeavor
to effect an enterprize without endeavors; that were
to create not to get victories.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The honor and profit: ſince man acting as a
rational creature by voluntary election, not by inſtinct
of Nature, or compulſive impulſe of Senſe, always
propounds ſome thing to himſelf, which appearing
under the notion of good, is called the final cauſe,
which though laſt in execution<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, is firſt in intention;
therefore much more in the management of the higheſt
affairs, man is entruſted with on earth, they ought to
uſe the greateſt reaſon; and Reaſon never excites the
will to proceed to election of any thing for its object,
that contains not real worth to render it eligible, or is
at leaſt gilded over with an amability.</p>
            <p>Now theſe three things were chiefly conſidered in
their deliberation.</p>
            <p>And as to the firſt, namely, The juſtneſs of the
Cauſe; that was affirmed to be as apparent as the Sun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
by whom all things are apparent; it being the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a perſecuted right, and ſuch a right, that had
been founded upon an indubitate ſucceſſion for many
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:52129:155"/>
generations, proclamed by the voyce of heaven the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and confirmed by the Law of Nature and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>And to that Objection that <hi>Hiarbas</hi> his right, both by
Conqueſt, and by <hi>Agis</hi> his reſignation, had ſwallowed
up <hi>Danpion</hi>'s, Reply was made: To the firſt Part of
the Objection, That Nature was an impartial Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and Univerſals were equally ſhared among Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
and Individuals: Now if it was an Univerſal Rule,
That Might could purchaſe Right, then it was as juſt
for <hi>Danpion</hi> to regain the Kingdom by force, as <hi>Hiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi>
by force to poſſeſs it. If the longeſt ſword is a fit
tool to carve Crowns for one, it is for another. If the
Trophies of Conqueſt can afford materials for a
Throne for one, they can for another. But the Sword
uſing no other Arguments, than thoſe of Victory and
Succeſs, cannot be a fit way to conſtitute, nor a fit Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
to determine Right: And though it may plead
Cuſtom and Example, yet ſuch Pleas are only valid
with thoſe, whoſe ignorance of the Original and true
conſtitution of Right, Equity, and Juſtice, diſpoſeth
them to adhere to a Precedent; and though they follow
the example of one, whoſe actions were probably enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled
juſt, becauſe they eſcaped that vengeance that
purſues injuſtice: We are not to ſquare our actions by
anothers, unleſs he ſquares his by the rules of juſtice:
And though (it is true) in the ſtate of War, that all
men are in, before the inſtitution of Common-wealths,
(every man by nature being as a little World, ſo a little
Republick) a Right procured by the Sword is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,
becauſe unjuſtice is the wrongful detaining of
anothers Propriety; now one man having as much
right to all things as another, there can be no Propriety,
until a coercive Power is eſtabliſhed, that muſt divide
this vaſt Common into Incloſures; yet after Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:52129:155"/>
are inſtituted, to invade anothers right, is not
to procure a Propriety, but a Poſſeſſion; for Propriety is
a Right to enjoy and improve any thing transferred by
mutual voluntary compact, under a coercive Power,
that can render the Contract valid, by compelling the
mutual performance: Now a Covenant being an act
of the Will, and the Will having only ſome good for
its Object, and no greater evil, than to abandon means
of ſelf-preſervation (which is the end and uſe of all
things we ſeek to enjoy) therefore none can be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
voluntarily to renounce his right of enjoyment of
that, the loſs whereof tends to his deſtruction; becauſe
he therein cannot be thought to aim at any good to
himſelf.</p>
            <p>Again, a Covenant being a voluntary act, muſt be
free from all coercion: For though the Elicit actions
of the Will are not ſubject to compulſion, yet the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
actions are ſomtimes forced to rebel againſt its
commands and dictates: Now a Covenant being a
voluntary transferring of Right, that is, not a conferring
a Right upon another that he had not before, becauſe
Nature equally ſhares all things, among all perſons,
but a deveſting ones ſelf of a liberty of interrupting
anothers Original Right, in the thing alienated, or a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
ſtanding out of the way, that another may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
his Original Right derived to him by Nature: As
<hi>Alexander,</hi> when he eclipſed the Sun, by his interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
between it and <hi>Diogines</hi>'s little Hermitage, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his ſtation at the <hi>Cynicks</hi> requeſt: But an enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
purchaſed by force, doth not by a reciprical tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
of ſome good, move the Will of any one by
compact, voluntarily to renounce his Right, or liberty
of impeding anothers uſe of his own Right Original,
and to remove himſelf away the main obſtacle, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thruſts ſuch a one away by force; as if <hi>Diogines</hi>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:52129:156"/>
ſhould have crowded <hi>Alexander</hi> from between him
and the Suns Rayes.</p>
            <p>And therefore a Right ſo procured, is only a preſent
fruition, that is Poſſeſſion, until a ſtronger ſnatches the
Prey. Hence, no one can inveſt himſelf with a right
of Soveraignety only by force, a power of governing
ſo procured, being not a Soveraignty, but a Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
For all Soveraigntie, or Power of governing
others, is Originally derived from a certain number of
Perſons, covenanting one with another, to ſurrender
up their natural right of Self-gubernation, to one or
more Perſons, who repreſenting the whole, ſo united
by mutual compact, may uſe the power and ſtrength
of them all for the ſafety, and benefit, and weal of the
Publick.</p>
            <p>Therefore a Power attained by violence, is not a
Power to rule, but tyrannize; the multitude having
never ſo much as implicitly transferred over their right,
and conſequently not obliged to obedience, any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than as their Non-obedience may turn to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction:
And in that reſpect, the right of Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
being equally ſhared among all Perſons, by nature,
the diſproportion only remains in this, Thar ſuch a
one hath the longeſt Sword.</p>
            <p>But concerning the ſecond part of the Objection,
<hi>viz:</hi> That <hi>Agis</hi> had transferred over his right to <hi>Hiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi>
by Reſignation, this was the ſolution:</p>
            <p>Firſt, though it is true, Covenants entred into by
force are Obligatory, from the Law of Nature that
commands Self-preſervation, and conſequently an
Election of thoſe means that tend thereunto; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if an extorted reſignation be a means to procure
ſuch a good, as a freedom from that evil that is the
Object of fear, it cannot but be binding, where there
is no other Law (as in the conditihn of meer Nature)
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:52129:156"/>
forbiddeth the performance; but ſuch Covenants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
acts of men, conſidered as in the condition of War,
are therefore obliging no longer, than until there ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
a new and juſt cauſe of fear, and then he is much
obliged by the ſame Law, that for Self-conſervation
commanded him to reſign up ſuch a Right, becauſe
the reſervation of it was inconſiſtent with his preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
to re-inveſt himſelf with that right he relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed,
if it be the only means for his ſafety, as before
he was to reſign it up.</p>
            <p>But it was alleged, That there was a juſt cauſe of
fear, though not in <hi>Agis,</hi> yet in <hi>Danpion</hi> his Heir, or
Repreſentative, who had the ſentence of Death paſſed
upon him, and therefore might juſtly ſeek to re-gain
the Kingdom, not only as his lawful inheritance, but
to preſerve himſelf from the invaſions of <hi>Hiarbas,</hi>
there being nothing more reaſonable than Anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that is, the over-powring thoſe Perſons that ſeek
ones deſtruction.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, The people of <hi>Theſſalia</hi> had given
the ſoveraignty to thoſe that were lineally deſcended
of <hi>Agis</hi>'s Anceſtors, and therefore were bound by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
to obey them, as their lawful Soveraigns:
Conſequently <hi>Agis,</hi> though he might diſpoſe of the
Government during his life, yet not of the Succeſſion;
becauſe he derived no ſuch authority from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Soveraigntie, the Multitude, in the firſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and therefore the transferring of the right of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
from his Poſterity to a ſtranger, was the giving
away anothers Propriety, or an aſſiſting of one, in the
invaſion of another.</p>
            <p>Hence, <hi>Hiarbas</hi> was but a temporary King, to whom
the entire exerciſe of Power was committed for a time;
which once expired, his Power muſt alſo expire with
it: after which, his Government was but an unjuſt U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:52129:157"/>
or a wrongful detaining of anothers Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing they conſulted about, was the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility
of accompliſhing: For Policy forbids any man
to ingage in a War, though for a juſt and lawful reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of his own; unleſs he can produce pregnant and
demonſtrative aſſurances, that he ſhall be ſeconded
with ſucceſs. But they did not doubt of ſucceſs, for
theſe Reaſons:</p>
            <p>Firſt becauſe, the ſooner any thing comes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
the ſooner it declines to corruption and diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution;
ſo the ſooner any arrives at the height of power,
the nearer he is to his declenſion. And this was <hi>Hiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi>
caſe, being on a ſudden rebounded, by a ſtrange
fortune, into the throne, from the ground of a hopeleſs
irreſolution.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As in Nature, ſo in Government, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is permanent that is violent. For though for a
time a Tyrant <hi>(i.e.</hi> an unjuſt Uſurper, or poſſeſſor of
anothers Power, to whom the right of ſoveraignty in
Propriety belongs) though for ſome time he may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derprop
his ſtate with the Sword and Policy; yet in the
end, Divine Juſtice ſnaps the Sword in ſunder, infatuates
his Council, and makes his own the ſubaltern cauſes of
his down-fall.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Hiarbas,</hi> as he came to his Government by a
Politick violence, ſo he upheld it by the ſame; and
therefore they feared not, but that falſe pretended right,
inſcribed by the Sword-point, on the leaf of a Laurel,
would be diſſipated, like the Prophecies of that <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bill,</hi>
that uſed Leaves for her Paper, by the blaſts of
Heavens Vengeance.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That Government that is erected on the
Baſis of a Faction, cannot ſtand; becauſe the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being too narrow for the Fabrick, and it having no
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:52129:157"/>
Internal Principle of ſtability, muſt be upheld by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Props, and conſequently ſubject to diſſolution,
upon the leaſt failing of that force, by which it was
conſtituted.</p>
            <p>But as the former was moſt apparently true in <hi>Hiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi>
his Government, ſo alſo the latter; <hi>viz:</hi> That that
force that was the Architect of his ſoveraignty, daily
declined thorow inteſtine diſorder. Theſe, and many
other Reaſons that were then given, encouraged them
in their high enterprize.</p>
            <p>But as for the third thing, <hi>viz:</hi> the Honour and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
that would redound, if their atchivements were
crowned with ſucceſs, that was ſo conſpicuous, as it
required no great conſideration. So that in Fine, this was
the reſult of the conſultation, That <hi>Athalus</hi> ſhould
march with his men to the Court, and pretend to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted
from <hi>Pandion,</hi> through an opinion of the merit
of <hi>Hiarbas</hi>'s Cauſe; that ſince <hi>Danpion</hi> was exiled
from thence, and none to nouriſh Faction in the Court
or Kingdom, <hi>Athalus</hi> by that means might ingratiate
himſelf with the King, and breed emulation among the
Nobles, and diſſentions among the Commonalty; that
ſo by that means, they might fit all things in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
againſt the firſt acceſs of a ſmiling fortune. And
as for <hi>Danpion,</hi> it was thought not ſafe for him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt
himſelf in any part of the Kingdom, unleſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed;
it was therefore reſolved, that he ſhould attire
himſelf in the habit of a Lady, and go to the Court as
a companion of <hi>Matilda</hi>'s, and ſo make that mask a
ſtep at once to reach the prize of his Ambition and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>Theſe things thus agreed on, <hi>Danpion</hi> arrayes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in a white ſilken Robe, that taught from his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to the ground, the train whereof ſtrayed a pretty
diſtance from his heels, and before was bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ned with
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:52129:158"/>
rich Jewels, from his neck, to his knees, and there left
open to diſcover the pure whiteneſs of his skin: His
leggs and feet were impriſoned within the gilded La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth
of rich Buskins, which were faſtned under his
knee, with a moſt precious Jewel, where the ends of
all the Knots did centre and unite: His hair being
very long, after the <hi>Theſſalian</hi> manner, hung looſely,
and careleſly upon his ſhoulders, having no other at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
upon his head, than a lawn Veil caſt over his head,
face, and ſhoulder, on the top of which, he wore a
Coronet of Gold, ſet with Diamonds, the antient Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
of Virgin-Princeſſes in ſome parts of <hi>Greece.</hi> Thus
arrayed, he ſteps up into the Chariot, and ſits on the
right hand of <hi>Matilda,</hi> and accompanies her to the
Court, under the name of <hi>Celania;</hi> where in a ſhort
time they arrived, and were received by <hi>Hiarbas</hi> (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
notice given by a Herauld from <hi>Athalus,</hi> what they
were, and what the intents of their coming) with all
poſſible demonſtrations of Honour; not neglecting any
ceremonies or complements that appertain to State, but
manifeſting all things that might expreſs the greatneſs
of a Princes mind, who ſcorns to be overcome in cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie.</p>
            <p>And as for the two Ladies, <hi>Celania</hi> and <hi>Matilda,</hi>
with the four Virgins that were the Attendants, they
were conducted by a chief Gentleman-Uſher, thorow
the outward Court, to a ſtately Gallery, that led into
a moſt beautiful Garden; where they were received by
a Lady of Honour, and thence led to the Princeſs <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phigenia;</hi>
who in her Chamber was ſet in a Chair of
State, under a moſt rich Canopy of cloth of gold, with
many young beautiful Ladies, clad in Crimſon Damask,
attending on her.</p>
            <p>Amongſt whom, her moſt tranſcendent beauty made
her ſhine, with as much ſuperiority, as the Sun doth over
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:52129:158"/>
the leſſer Luminaries; ſo excellent and incomparable
were the Graces that ſat enſhrined in her lively Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
as ſhe ſeemed as a perfect mirror of all beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Majeſty; ſuch a miraculous compoſition of all
thoſe Excellencies, that can at once both enraviſh with
delight, and tranſport with admiration: She ſeemed
(as indeed ſhe was) a fitter ſubject for the pen of

to comprehend, as their being converſant with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Glories, to deſcribe the ſublimity of her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
than any Mortal whatſoever; becauſe, though
he had an underſtanding as vaſt as the Creation, that he
could put a Girdle upon Nature, and might, like the
Bee, here and there extract the choyceſt Flowers, that
grow in her Garden, to fill his invention with ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
yet being cooped within the Univerſe, he can
no more deſcribe the perfection of her beauties, than a

            <p>In this ſtately poſture ſhe ſate, until the Ladies were
conducted into her preſence, and then ſhe aroſe and
ſaluted them, with a countenance and geſture expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
ſo much ſweetneſs, but yet tempered with ſuch a
lovely, but ſtately reſervedneſs, as ſhe at once gave
them their due Honour, and yet retained her own
State; ſo that Majeſty in her deportments ſeemed to
deſcend on the wings of Humility, like <hi>Phaebus</hi>'s Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,
ruled by <hi>Phaeton,</hi> and inflamed their hearts with
admiration; but eſpecially <hi>Celanias</hi>'s who was ſtruck
into a ſtrange kind of tranſport, that had near diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her, had not conſcience recovered her; for her heart
fell into ſuch a vehement panting, and her body was
arreſted with ſuch a quiv'ring, as even hindred both her
ſpeech and geſtures, at leaſt the grace of them, ſo that
ſhe at firſt wiſhed ſhe could purchaſe a hanſom convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
out of the Room, with the loſs of thoſe delights
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:52129:159"/>
               <hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s preſence afforded: And no wonder,
for ſhe was never before acquainted with the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of ſo near an acceſs; much leſs therefore with the
effects of love, when extafied with ſo near an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to the object beloved, and leaſt of all with
an Antidote againſt the ſtrange influence of thoſe
effects.</p>
            <p>But at length the conſideration of thoſe miſeries
that would be in the event of her diſcovery, conquered
thoſe pangs, and gave his reaſon the ſoveraignty over
his paſſion; ſo that though at firſt Paſſion diſdained to
hearken to Reaſon as a Councellor, it now refuſed not
to be ſubject to it as a Prince.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Celania</hi> being now in a capacity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

into conference with <hi>Amphigenia,</hi> the cadences of
whoſe words ſeemed to her a melody beyond the very
reliſhes and cloſes of Angels Muſick, as her features
ſeemed to tranſcend Angelical Beauty. After ſome
time conſumed in pleaſant diſcourſes, <hi>Amphigenia</hi>
led them into the Gardens, and there ſhewed them all
the delights might have ſated an Epicure. Such a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
had Art and Nature there ſet forth to feaſt the
ſight, as might ſatiate the moſt greedy pomp-expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
eyes, ſatiate? rather aſtoniſh. Neither were the
eyes alone partakers of the mollitious pleaſures of that
Paradiſe, but the ears were enriched with all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
a well-touched Lute (that ſweet Exchequer of
delights) could afford, whoſe reſounding womb
ſeemed the Limbeck of harmony, where its quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
was diſtilled, which gently dropping thorough
the ear into the Cabinet of Senſe, the Brain, with its
ſoft pleaſures charms the ſoul.</p>
            <p>But this was but a prelude to a conſort of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
excellently plaid on by delicate Ladies, ſitting
under a Sun-proof Arbor, whoſe features ſeemed as
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:52129:159"/>
full of harmony to their eyes, as their Muſick was
beautiful to the ears. But whilſt they were keeping
time in Muſick, time danced by ſo nimbly, as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in keeping loſt it, each minute crowded on ſo faſt,
and ſeemed to tread on its predeceſſors heels, as if it
feared the others loytering might intercept its plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures:
ſo that it was not long ere the farr-extended
ſhadows of the mountains, ſeemed ſent as meſſengers
from <hi>Titan,</hi> to tell them the news of his declenſion,
when ſupper was in great ſtate ſerved into the Banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
houſe; a ſtately building ſuſpended in the Air on
Marble pillars, ſtanding on a flowry plain, embraced
with the Silver ſtreams of a purlling River that gently
crept along: the Chamber above was hung with cloth
of Tiſſue, in the midſt of it was a round Tribunal
made of Porphyry, on the top of which was a chair of
State, wherein was placed the Statue of <hi>Diana,</hi> richly
apparelled, a golden ſcepter in her hand, and the three
Graces attending on her, playing on wind Inſtruments,
which were carved ſo lively, that as their figure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the ſight, ſo did the Muſick the hearing, which
the water conveyed by ſilver pipes thorough the pillars
made them compoſe.</p>
            <p>But all theſe glories ſeemed to <hi>Celania</hi> onely to
adorn the tryumph of <hi>Amphigena</hi>'s beauty, which
lead captive more hearts than they did eyes, or the
Muſick ears; ſo that ſhe viewed them onely with a
careleſs eye, accounting nothing worth the ſeeing in
<hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s preſence but her, nor ſcarce ever caſting
a glance on any thing; unleſs it were on that whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
excellence might juſtly challenge a look
from a Criticks eye, and then ſhe would compare it with
her, to render her Beauty incomparable. But if <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phigenia</hi>
chanced to crop a ſlower, or treaſure up the
perfumes of a Roſe, or diſperſe the rays of her f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

eyes on any object, then ſhe would look and look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
envy the flower, grow jealous of the Roſe, and
grieve that ſhe her ſelf was not the object. Ah! (would
ſhe ſay) thou pretty Martyre, how happy art thou to
loſe thy life by ſo ſweet an executioner! And when
ſhe ſaw it wither in her hands: Poor ſenſeleſs flower
(ſaid ſhe) cannot a glance from that eye revive thee?
nor a touch of that hand (whoſe ſoft delicacy would
warm a heart bennumed with Age, and in deſpight of
years recall Youth fled with Time) cannot ſuch a hand
(I ſay) ſtop the career of thy beauties? Poor fooliſh
flower, what meaneſt thou to let death raviſh thy
ſweets? deface that portraiture of beauty, pencil'd by
Nature in thy leaves? demoliſh thy lovely Cittadel of
lovelineſs? thinkeſt thou to reſume more ſweetneſs,
more beauty, more lovelineſs, from her moſt ſweet,
moſt beautiful, and moſt lovely hand? no (fond thing)
her chaſtneſs hates a proſtitute. What then? what is
the matter? doſt thou bequeath thy ſweets to her? and
do they by a ſecret tranſition paſs away from thee, and
by tranſmigration dwell in her? no ſure, her Ocean of
beauty needs not thy drop, her infinite treaſures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
on her by too prodigal heaven, ſure needs not the
addition of thy poor mite: no, no, thou pineſt away
with grief, and ſo do I.</p>
            <p>Again, when ſhe ſaw her extract the fragrancy of a
Roſe: Oh! too happy flower (would ſhe ſay) and in
this onely unhappy, that thou art ignorant of thy hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
Little thinkeſt thou where thy fading ſweets do
lye entomb'd; thou wouldſt not grutch to part with all
thy wealth, kneweſt thou but where its treaſured, nor

Her pure hand that divides thee from thy root, doth
but tranſport thee from thy native dwelling, to the
Vermilion Orient of her lips, where ſhe changes the
Aromaticks of her breath for thy poor odours. Oh!
Oh! might my ſoul be refined by the heat of Loves

            </p>
            <p>Theſe and the like ſpeeches would ſhe wiſper to her
ſelf upon every occaſion, extracting out of that Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of delights, onely what might feed the appetite of
love. And when Supper was ſerved in, though there was

               </gap>e rarities that could be expected at a refection in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by an Epicure, to feaſt his Senſe without ſenſe

let her eyes riot in the moſt luxuriant banquet of
<hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s beauty, which ſhe did with the more
confidence, preſuming her diſguize might make her
looks unregarded, or at moſt unſuſpected. Such ſtrange
effects did Love work in <hi>Celania</hi>'s heart. If <hi>Amphige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
ſpake, the ſweet harmony of her voice, and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
in her ſpeech, would ſtrike <hi>Celania</hi> mute. If
<hi>Amphigenia</hi> afforded her a glance, the luſtre of her
eyes (like the Sun whoſe own brightneſs is his ſhade,
and ſends a drop to veil a gazers eye) would ſtrike <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lania</hi>
blind. If <hi>Amphigenia</hi> graced a Lute with h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſtrike <hi>Celania</hi> motionleſs.</p>
            <p>And thus did <hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s preſence abſent <hi>Celania</hi>
from her ſelf. But ſupper being ended, after a great

This <hi>Dokimaſtus</hi> being preſent at the Mask, giving
liberty to his eyes to range among that Paradiſe of
Beauties, chanced among other Ladies to eſpye <hi>Celania</hi>
covered with her Veil, according to her wonted garb;
who having not her education among thoſe of that Sex
which ſhe ſeemed to perſonate, and therefore unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with many female accompliſhments, in the
catalogue of which the compleat deportment of the
body in Dancing is eſteemed not the leaſt, which ſhe
being wholly a ſtranger to, and therefore juſtly fearing

The ſtrangeneſs of her garb and deportment,
as they made many other objects ungazed on, by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording
as much matter for admiration as they for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
ſo in particular they drew a more curious obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation

begat a conceipt in him that was not in others,
<hi>viz.</hi> that this <hi>Celania</hi> was no other then <hi>Glycera</hi> the

and for love of ſome Courtier or other fled thither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

            <p>This conceipt having admiſſion into his thoughts,
did by degrees conquer all oppoſition, bribe his belief
with accumulation of Arguments from his continued

            <p>Theſe reſolves he cloſetted in his thoughts, till
Time the winged Poſt-horſe of opportunity, that
Whet-ſtone of reſolution that keenes the edge of the

next morning by that time <hi>Aurora</hi>'s bluſhing cheeks
had wept her pearly drops, and ſitting in her gilded
Chariot drawn with purple Steeds, had chaſt away the
Stars, and triumphed over the gloomy Night, the two
Princeſſes <hi>Amphigenia</hi> and <hi>Celania</hi> having forſaken the
Snowy Paradiſe of their beds, walked forth into the
Groves and Gardens, to ſhare in the Morns refined

            <p>It happened that at this time <hi>Ternotus</hi> a Squire that
attended on <hi>Dokimaſtus,</hi> invited forth by the Morns
mollitious ſweets, was walking upon a little hill to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh
himſelf with <hi>Zephyres</hi> cooling gales, where he
chanced to eſpy theſe two Ladies, ſitting under the
green Canopy of a ſhady Bower, and earneſt in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
<hi>Celania</hi> had her beauty eclipſed with her Lilly
Veil, as ſhe had wont; but <hi>Amphigenia</hi> fully diſplayed
the treaſure of her beauty, where ſhe ſeemed to ſhew
all the riches of Nature; as ſhe ſat under the Bower
her eyes ſeemed pearly Bowers where thouſands of
Loves and Graces ſeemed to flutter up and down, and
with their ſwift Arrows feathered with Majeſtick love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
and tipt with Diamonds, would wound behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
hearts: So that the Bower ſeemed a ſhady Palace,
where heart-commanding beauty, attended with a

great retinue of perfections, ſeemed to keep its Court;
or as an <hi>Aſylum</hi> under whoſe verdant Roof, the Stars
in day time kept their reſidence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ternotus</hi> having paid a little duty to admiration (as
whom would it not tranſport with wonder, to behold
ſo many wonders?) run to his Maſter, and told him
what lovely objects that morning had ſaluted his eyes
withall. <hi>Dokimaſtus</hi> hearing that, went by his Squires
direction to the place where he beheld thoſe two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Ladies, whom he had no ſooner ſeen, but he
knew to be <hi>Celania</hi> and <hi>Amphigenia;</hi> the rays of whoſe
beauty made the day-break of occaſion, for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of his plot; ſo that he preſently diſcloſes his
intents to <hi>Ternotus</hi> (having firſt ſworn him to ſecreſie.)
Much time they ſpent not in traverſing of their
thoughts, till at length having agreed upon a way,
which their reaſon perſwaded them would prove effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual,
They on a ſudden ruſh into the Grove, where the
Ladies ſat <hi>(Ternotus</hi> having firſt fetcht their weapons,

Valley, ſome diſtance from the Gardens, where
they diſrobed <hi>Celania</hi> of her Garments, and clothed
her in that habit, and ſet <hi>Amphigenia</hi> in a Coach that
they had prepared ready for that purpoſe; but by that
time they had accompliſht their endeavors, the ſhrieks
of <hi>Amphigenia</hi> (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s out-crys, the Airy meſſengers of her

ears of many in the Court, and with a doleful ſhrill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:52129:163"/>
challenged ſpeedy ſuccour; who hearkning
more to the noiſe, than to diſcretion or deliberation, ran
out, ſome dreſt, ſome undreſt, ſome with Weapons, ſome
without, but uſing the ſtill mourning voice, as a winged
guide, by which they directed their ſteps, until they
came to the Valley, where they beheld <hi>Dokimaſtus</hi> deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately
engaged in a Combat with <hi>Celania,</hi> whom now
in that garb they knew to be <hi>Danpion;</hi> and as for
<hi>Amphigenia,</hi> ſhe was hurried away in the Coach, with
ſo much ſwiftneſs, as to prevent being overtaken with
the nimbleſt Foot-man; yet not ſo as to prevent their
ears from overtaking the voyce, which like winged
<hi>Pegaſus,</hi> rode on the ayr, and cryed, Help <hi>Amphigenia,</hi>
Help <hi>Amphigenia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſight and voice ſo filled the eyes and ears of the
new arrived company, did ſo diſtract and confound
them with amazement, and all thoſe Paſſions that aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
ſpirits with amazing confuſion at ſuch ſudden ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,
as that whilſt their hatred to <hi>Danpion,</hi> but love
and duty to <hi>Amphigenia,</hi> prompted them both to kill
the one, and ſave the other, and at once to do all
things, the ſwelling Torrent of Amazement, dammed
up the Current of their deſires, and compelled them to
do nothing: Some would purſue <hi>Amphigenia,</hi> whileſt

would fight with <hi>Danpion,</hi> whileſt themſelves were
conquered with a mad rage.</p>
            <p>Thus the fight continued for a time, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

ran furiouſly among them, as if it had been one of <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s
mad Palfreys, and killed ſome, trampled on others,
and diſperſt them all; ſo that <hi>Danpion</hi> watched his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
catched hold of the Reigns, and wanting
neither agility of body, ſprightfulneſs of mind, nor
skill in horſman-ſhip, nimbly vaulted upon him, and

               </gap>ight of them all, made his eſcape.</p>
            <p>By this time newes was fled to the King, that <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion</hi>
had carried away by force his Daughter, and with
her, the princeſs <hi>Celania,</hi> and how that <hi>Dokimaſtus</hi> was
much wounded in their defence, and many others ſlain,
and how that his juſt revenge for all theſe villainous
acts, was anticipated by <hi>Danpion</hi>'s flight: But as if
theſe wounding words, Force, and Flight, had forc'd
his Reaſon to flight, he ſo unreaſonably ſtormed, as he
ſeemed nothing but an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

What (ſaid he) <hi>Amphigenia</hi> gone? And with that he
ſtampt on the ground with his foot, and made the earth
quake with his fury, whilſt fury made an Earth-quake
in him: But then he went on,—<hi>Amphigenia!</hi> The life
of all my Comforts, the ſtay of all my Hopes, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
treaſury of my Joyes; and is ſhe gone? Gone? Nay
raviſhed; raviſhed? Nay dead, for ought I know. Oh!
Deadly word! Dead! and I live, and live to ſee all
this unrevenged? Oh! Tyrant-heaven! Was it not
enough to rob me of my Daughter? My only Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but you muſt plunder me of all means for revenge
too? For Revenge, for Juſtice; if it be not juſt to rid
the world of ſuch a Monſter, I know not what is juſt;
and if ſo, Why did you blindly put the Sword of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
into my hands? But oh! you Powers! If you
will tyrannize, I am your Vice-gerent, and am war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
by your example; and with that he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Courtiers ſpeedily to purſue them, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to hang them, if they came back without one, or

But now, to return to <hi>Danpion,</hi> who had overtaken
<hi>Amphigenia,</hi> by that time the Coach was arrived at
<hi>Pandion</hi>'s Caſtle; ſo that ſome of the Souldiers that
were upon the Walls, ſeeing a gallant and beautiful
Lady, hunted by a man on Horſ-back, with a drawn
Sword (for <hi>Danpion,</hi> by reaſon of the madneſs of the
Horſe, had not time to impriſon it in the Scabbard, and

               </gap> terms,
began to treat with them in the churliſh language
of War, and diſpute his Title to Liberty; till at laſt he
was confuted by the ſharp Sophiſtry of multiplyed
Swords: who, after they had argued a while in the
ſchool of War, at laſt prevailed, and led them to <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dions</hi>
General; who at the firſt view of theſe two excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and beautiful Perſonages, was poſſeſt with ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
wonder, that every beam of their Beauty, was a
bright Key, that lockt up his ſenſes in the Priſon of
amazement.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Danpion,</hi> though his Habit became not one of
his Birth and Greatneſs, yet he ſo became his Habit,
as he ſeemed to put a Majeſty on Poverty; that whileſt
his garb preſented him as anothers ſervant, all thoſe
excellent endowments, that give height of mind in
the loweſt fortune, attended on him: His Eyes were
graced with ſuch a verecundious ſternneſs, as ſeemed
at once to allure and threaten; ſome terrifying flaſhes
would glance from them, but yet with ſuch a mixture
of a well-becoming ſuavity, as inflamed the heart with
a greater admiration of his Beauty: His Countenance
(in which appeared no common Ayr) though ſomthing
clouded, not with a dejecting, but rather ſuch a tumid
grief, as uſually attends thoſe great ſouls, whom no
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:52129:165"/>
fortunes can diſcompoſe, but thoſe that deprive them
of the exerciſe of Vertue; yet thorow thoſe Clouds
there ſhined ſuch Rayes of an undaunted Majeſty, as
might well deſerve the higheſt admiration in thoſe
mindes that eſteem nothing vulgar.</p>
            <p>But as for <hi>Amphigenia,</hi> ſhe ſeemed a Perſon ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
excellent, tis fitter to leave the Soul
extaſied with the contemplation of her Beauty, than to
attmept its Delineation, ſince no Tongue, nor Pen can
pourtray them, but muſt be vaſt debtors to her Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And that that added no ſmal luſtre to her Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
was her Magnanimity under this misfortune, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
rather that her heart ſhould break within, than her
ſorrow break out; and reſolving, that Death ſhould
raviſh her Soul from her Body, ſooner than the ſaddeſt
accident her Vertue from her Soul; and making it the
chiefeſt point of Vertue, to be commander of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Paſſions, whileſt her outward eſtate was a ſervant
to Fortune: And this preſent miſery, though circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced
with all the evils that envy could wiſh for, or
her ſelf deteſt, not only her Perſon, but her Chaſtity
being at the diſpoſal of one, whom a double Antipathy,
both as a man, and an enemy made infinitely hateful;
yet by foyling it with her Vertue, ſhe made ſerve, but
as an Ornament to the beauty of her Vertues: So that
the Clouds of ſadneſs in her Countenance, made the
brighter reflections of the beams of a ſtately Majeſty.</p>
            <p>Whileſt <hi>Pandion</hi> was taken up with the Proſpect of
ſuch Heavenly Aſpects, the Coach-man (that had been
the <hi>Charon</hi> that had hurried this ſad Princeſs to ſuch a
Hell of miſery) comes to him, and humbly craves a
minutes conference: He conſenting, the Coach-man
informs him, who that beautiful Subject of his admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was, and by what, and whoſe means, and for what
end he had conveyed her thither; and as for the other,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:52129:165"/>
he preſumed he was ſome Attendant of the Kings, by
whoſe command he purſued them.</p>
            <p>This news was as a Charm to <hi>Pandion</hi>'s Paſſion, that
gently did allay the ſurges of aſtoniſhment, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
them into a ſmooth Sea of contentment: For
now he doubted not but to procure the Kingdom, ſince
he had gotten the Inherit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ix within his Power, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her to reſign up her Right, to ranſom her Chaſtity,
or her Farher his Power, to ranſom her. And obſerving
in the looks of <hi>Danpion,</hi> the Enſigns of a brave reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
mind, and fearing leſt by his valour he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe
the Princeſs, he gave ſtrict charge to the chief
Commander of the Caſtle, that if within a ſhort ſpace
none came to redeem him, he ſhould be put to Death,
to ſatisfie for the blood of thoſe of his men whom he
had ſlain.</p>
            <p>But as he was farther ſpeaking, he was interrupted
by a ſudden Allarm, given to the Souldiers within by
the Watch; who (it ſeems) had not only ſeen a Cloud
of duſt ariſe, as if ſome <hi>Demogorgon</hi> had belcht through
a porous part of the earth, but they had alſo eſpyed, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially,
when the Wind made a chaſm in this duſty
Region, the ſhining of Armour, which like portentous
Comets threatned Deſtructions; or as gliſtring Stars
were the Harbingers of a bloody day to enſue.</p>
            <p>This Martial noiſe coming to <hi>Pandions</hi> ears, as the
Prologue of a bloody Scene, by reaſon of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
did challenge, with Authority from him, a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Attendance; who loath to make negligence
the Author of an irrecoverable Ruine, or his Ruine
the mark of an unredeemable neglect, preſently runs
upon the Caſtle-walls, where he might eſpye vaſt
Numbers of ſhining Swords, which though naked,

               </gap>d their too ſpeedy aſſault, by ſending a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauld
with Propoſals, and a challenge; which, after
conſultation with ſome of the chief Commanders,
he did; the purport of whoſe Meſſage was this: That
both for putting a Period to that deſtructive War,
whoſe terrible effects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had hitherto been no other
than the ſacking of many famous Towns and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
the ranſacking and plundring of many Lords
and Gentlemen, and the general depopulating of
the whole Kingdom; That the whole quarrel ſhould
be decided by the Perſons moſt and onely concern'd,
(which was the King and himſelf) in a ſingle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate;
which proffer, in regard of the advantage he
had in poſſeſſing, not onely the greater part of the
Realm, but the Realms immediate Heir, he could not
but judge juſt and honourable, upon which grounds
he hoped it would be ſo eſteemed and accepted.</p>
            <p>The Herauld having his Meſſage given him, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
in the Apparel of his Office, attended by a
Trumpet, and (as <hi>Pandion</hi> had commanded) carrying
a Gantlet dipt in blood, rides to the Army, where he
craves audience of the King; which being granted, he

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ung down his Gantlet, and delivered his Challenge.</p>
            <p>The King hearing it, replyed, That it was not the
cuſtom of Kings to deſcend to a private Duell with a
Subject, much leſs with a Rebel; but if it was, that
his Cauſe was not ſo unjuſt, that he feared ſucceſs, nor
his Souldiers ſuch Cowards, as they feared to fight,
nor his Condition ſo low, as to uſe deſperate means,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:52129:166"/>
nor himſelf ſo unwiſe, as to leave his Cauſe, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
Perſon, and Army, to the Governance and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitration
of For<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>une and Chaunce, which is apt ever
to favour the raſh and fooliſh: And were his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
never ſo low, he would have him know, that
Kings in their loweſt eſtate, are highly conſiderable,
and one grain of Majeſty will weigh down many
light pretences; though may be not in the Ballance of
popular judgment, yet in theirs who poize the Univerſe.</p>
            <p>And for his Kingdom and Daughter, though by
he did not know what blind fortune he had attained
ſome part of the firſt, and by a baſe inferior Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
with Traytors, ſuch as himſelf, he had inſnared
the latter; yet let not (ſaid he) that ſucceſs heighten
his preſumption, nor encourage his perſeverance, ſince
the one will but add Unpardonableneſs, and the
other an impoſſibility of recovery to his horrid Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion:
Therefore (ſaid he) I ſhall not ſeek to ranſom
the one with the other, but if he means to redeem him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
let him reſign both to my Protection, and himſelf
to my Mercy. With this anſwer the Herauld return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and acquainted <hi>Pandion,</hi> who expected, and indeed
deſired no other; the end of his Meſſage being onely
to dally with Time, that paced by faſter, than conſiſted
with the well-fare of his affairs. But having now all
things in a readineſs, he marches forth with his men,
and as he goes, commands the Captain of the Caſtle,
that ſpeedy execution be done upon <hi>Hiarbas</hi>'s ſervant,
and charges him to be as vigilant of <hi>Amphigenia,</hi> as he
would of his ſoul, were it in anothers keeping. The
Captain having thus his Orders given hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, goes to
the Room where <hi>Danpion</hi> was, intending to releaſe him
out of the Priſon, but to impriſon him in the Grave;
but as ſoon as he ſeeth him, as if <hi>Danpion</hi>'s beauty had
turned him into Marble, he ſtands ſtill, as if he grew to
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:52129:167"/>
the ground, and fixes his eye ſtedfaſtly upon him, as if
he would inoculate his ſoul into him; at length, like one
returned out of a Trance, he kneels down and kiſſes
his hand. <hi>Danpion</hi> ſeeing this, at firſt amazed at his
amazement, and now no leſs aſtoniſht at this Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
thus ſpake to him: Sir (ſaid he) my fortunes
require no ſuch condeſcenſions. Sir (ſaid the other)
not onely the loweſt condeſcenſions, but the higheſt
ſoveraignty is your due by Deſcent and Deſert. Sir
(replyed <hi>Danpion)</hi> as I have not ſo much vanity to
think my ſelf worthy of the honour you impoſe upon
me, nor ſo little gratitude, as not to teſtifie my reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
though in huge diſproportion to your civilities;
ſo neither am I ſo happy, as not to be able to accuſe my
thoughts with the ſurrendry of your Name and Perſon
to Oblivion; which I muſt needs regiſter in the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of my misfortunes. Sir (ſaid the other) your
Noble thoughts are too much buſied in the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of goodneſs, ever to admit of ſuch diverſions,
as the remembrance of ſo mean a Perſon as my ſelf,
who have nothing in me that may merit regard, but
that I once ſerved your Highneſs in the quality of a
Foſter-father, being that ſame <hi>Celadon</hi> the Foreſter,
who once had the care of your Royal Perſon in your
infancy, whilſt your tender age, unable for ſelf-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
expoſed you to the malice and tyranny of your
Enemy <hi>Hiarbas. Danpion</hi> hearing this, fell upon his
neck, and embraced him, and even wept with joy, the
tears trickling down, like rain in Sun-ſhine. After
ſome mutual teſtimony of great endearments that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
betwixt them, the Foreſter kneeled down, and
asked him pardon for his trayterous adhering to his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy;
but the reaſon of it (he ſaid) was partly through
fear, being terrified with the loſs of all that nature and
affection could entitle Precious, upon the leaſt intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:52129:167"/>
of diſcovery; and partly for gain, being bribed
with liberal gifts, and great honors, above what he
knew how to manage, being made Commander of
the Caſtle where <hi>Pandion</hi> chiefly had his reſidence;
all which he the more freely accepted, becauſe he then
diſpaired of ever bleſſing his eyes with the ſight of his
Highneſs; ſuppoſing he had been torn in peices with
ſome of that brutiſh Nation, whom he uſed for his
ſport to perſecute.</p>
            <p>This ſaid, they fell into diſcourſe about <hi>Danpions</hi>
condition, whether there was any hopes or means for
eſcape; the Foreſter having firſt informed him, how
that <hi>Hiarbas</hi> was come with an Army to redeem his
Daughter; then whether it was poſſible to procure ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to <hi>Amphigenia;</hi> and whether <hi>Pandion</hi> intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any injury or diſhonor to her; and whether by force
or ſtratagem ſhe might be relea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed: but as they were
thus diſcourſing, ſome ſouldiers with a haſte too ſlow
for their minds, though too faſt for their leggs, came
ſtumbling into the room, and called away the Foreſter
their Captain.</p>
            <p>Long had they not been ſeparated, ere <hi>Danpion</hi>
heard a noiſe that ſounded like a rude conſort of many
ill-agreeing voices, which ſeemed to keep time to the
Martial Muſick of claſhing of ſwords, and juſtling of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor;
amongſt which he heard from a neighboring Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
ſuch ſhrieks, as ſeemed to teach the Air in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
manner the prefect language of miſery, which
by reaſon of its diſordered convoy (the Air being vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
divided with a ſtrange confuſion of noiſes) came
not to his ears ſo diſtinctly as to give him information
of the Autho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, yet by a ſtrange ſymyathy, it ſeemed to
wound his ſoul. His mind in travail with multitudes
of conceptions, would fain have been eaſed of its tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
with the knowledge of <hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s condition,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:52129:168"/>
which he endeavored by a near acceſs to the Chamber,
where all thoſe doleful births were generated; but ah!
not to a freedom f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>om, but an augmentation of his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
for he plainly, too plainly knew it be the voice of
<hi>Amphigenia.</hi> With that, as if every ſhriek had been a
Dart, not from ſorrow but from death, not from an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
death, but from a ſoul-torturing death, from a death
made deadly with torments, having his ſenſes ſtupified,
and his reaſon confounded, not with a ſorrow, rather
a deſperate madneſs, he ran about exclaiming againſt
Heaven, Hell, Earth, Men, Devils; Heaven for permitting
her to be abuſed, Earth for being the Theatre of ſuch an
accurſed Tragedy; Men for the Actors, &amp; the Devils for
the Inſpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ers. Then he would cry out; Oh! <hi>Celadon!</hi> why
didſt thou reſerve me for this? theſe are torments would
make an <hi>Atlas</hi> grown, ſhould a thouſand Lyons Den
within my breaſt, they would not tear me like one groan
of <hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s. Oh! curſed walls that hinder all my
attempts. And cruel Heaven! that denyes me the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
cure of miſery, a way to dye, which every ſlave
can command; one dying groan would ſumm up all
my miſeries. Tis true, as a Prince I ought to reſerve
my ſelf for better fortunes, and not to abandon my ſelf
though all the world forſake me; yet as a Lover of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phigenia,</hi>
I ought not to hope for joy whilſt ſhe remains
a Captive to her enemies, and the contrary paſſion.
Theſe and the like words did <hi>Danpion</hi> utter; and thus
did he ſacrifize himſelf to an unexpreſſible paſſion, who
in all things elſe ſhewed himſelf commander of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
mind. But now to leave him, and return to <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dion,</hi>
who perceiving that <hi>Hiarbas</hi> was reſolute in his
purpoſes, and wiſe in his reſolutions, and ſtrong to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
what his wiſdom had reſolved upon, thought it
more wiſdom to Treat with him peaceably, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr
his cauſe to the Arbitration of War, whoſe partial
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:52129:168"/>
deciſion he feared, eſpecially conſidering the unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his cauſe had made him an Out-law to Heaven,
from whom he could challenge no protection, and
therefore he again ſends an Envoy with certain Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals
to the King. The ſum of which was this, That if
the King regarded either his own or his Daughters
ſafety or honor, he ſhould retreat with his men, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
he muſt not hope for any other entertainment for
himſelf or her, than what a mortal enemy would beſtow
on the moſt hateful perſon. And to let them ſee that
his performance ſhould be of an equal extent with his
threatnings, before the meſſenger could deliver his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
receive an anſwer, and return, <hi>Pandion</hi> had cauſed
a Scaffold to be erected, whereon preſently appeared
a moſt excellent Lady, lead between two executioners,
whom both by her Garments, and the Majeſty that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrelled
her deportments, <hi>Hiarbas</hi> knew to be his
Daughter, for there ſeemed in her (as well as he could
perceive at ſuch a diſtance) the ſame delicate lovelineſs,
lovely excellency, Majeſtick ſweetneſs, as were the
ingredients of ſo divine a compoſition as <hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s
Beauty; and if the ſame perfections, then ſure the
ſame perſon, ſince none could boaſt of an equality with
her, in whom appeared all the excellencies, not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Nature had, but wherewith ſhe could beautifie a
body. A lamentable ſight it was to ſee, the Diamond
of the World ſet in an endleſs Ring of miſeries; to ſee
her act her own Tragedy, whoſe countenance ſeemed
the Theatre of Love and Beauty; to ſee her to whom
all hearts do homage, to bow to an injurious fortune.
And that that did extort pity from the cruelleſt heart,
was the manner of her geſtures, wherewith ſhe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Antedate her miſery, and make miſery it ſelf
more miſerable, at leaſt more lamentable; for her eyes
were fixt on Heaven, as if ſhe meant to dart her Soul
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:52129:169"/>
thither, and prevent her enemies cruelty; her tongue
not profuſe of words, her ſorrow ſeeming to feed it ſelf
with inward contemplation; yet thoſe few wherein ſhe
embodied her thoughts, were guarded with ſuch a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating
force, as would have compelled a Tyrants heart,
to pitty her ſorrow; but they were no ſooner Midwived
by her tongue, than ſwadled up in Air, and ſo bequeath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Heaven, that few ears could boaſt themſelves to
be the Nurſeries of ſuch Divine off-ſprings of a Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Soul. Her hands were claſped and folded each in
other, and ſeemed to take their laſt embracements; her
arms not extended at their length, but ſomething bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſeemed to embrace ſorrow, not as an unjuſt effect
of humane malice, but as a juſt reſult of a Divine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.</p>
            <p>In fine, in all her geſtures, there was ſuch a Majeſtick
humility, conquering ſubmiſſion, unconquered Piety,
ſolid devotion, as made a lively and beautiful repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of what a great mind could do, depreſſed under the
loweſt fortune. But though the beholders, yea the actors
were ſo acted by pity, as to pour forth their ſenſe of
her condition in tears, and (as it were) by a repentance
to waſh way the crime before Commiſſion, yet at length
as if the neceſſity of Commiſſion had baniſhed away all
thoughts of the crime, not the act, when they ſaw
<hi>Hiarbas</hi>'s men, marching in the order and poſture they
came into the Field<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> differing in nothing but in ſpeedy
motion, which too ſpeedily gave them to underſtand,
that their purpoſe was to redeem <hi>Amphigenia</hi> by force
not by Treaty, they by <hi>Pandions</hi> command, preſently
ſeparate her Head and Soul from her Body. But no
ſooner did the Air convey this ſad and bloody ſpectacle
to the eyes of <hi>Hiarbas,</hi> but he ſeemed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s if rage and

               </gap>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:52129:169"/>
Flaſhes flew from his eyes, as if he meant to ſet the
world on fire in revenge of his Daughter; or as if he
thought to uſe no other light, in ſcorn of the Sun,
whom in his thoughts he accuſed of conſpiracy with
them. And he commands his men to fall on, and
ſpare none but <hi>Pandion,</hi> that as he had been ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
in his Treaſons, ſo he might be exemplary in his
tortures. The King had no ſooner ſpoke theſe, or the
like words, but the ſignal was given, not for the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
but (to the aſtoniſhment of <hi>Pandion</hi> and his whole
Army, and of the Sun it ſelf, which then hid his face
in a cloud) for the execution of a plot between the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
and his Commanders, which was to take their
own King priſoner in the head of his Army, and to
deliver him up to <hi>Pandion;</hi> which by reaſon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination
was ſo ſtrong, was ſoon and eaſily effected
without ſedition or mutiny.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pandion</hi> amazed at this ſudden turn of the wheel of
Fortune, knew not at firſt how to interpret it, but ſtill
ſtood upon his defence expecting ſome ſtratagem. And
no leſs were his whole Army, though now by a ſtrange
fate Victorious, conquered with extremity of wonder;
aſtoniſhment viſibly tryumphing in every mans coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
till at length their wonder was converted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
joy, by the reſignation of <hi>Hiarbas</hi> into <hi>Pandions</hi>
poſſeſſion; who conſidering it was not a time to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
himſelf to any paſſion, when ſuch ſtrength of
reaſon was required for the wiſe improvement of ſuch
an overture of fortune, thought it the beſt way now
if ever, to fit <hi>Hiarbas</hi>'s Crown for his own head,
when melted in a Fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nace of misfortune, it ſeemed
apt to receive any form; and therefore cauſes ſtrong
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uards to be placed every where, and particularly
about himſelf, and now ſtronger then ever, his neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
being greater, and his force more, by the addition
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:52129:170"/>
of <hi>Hiarbias</hi>'s men. This done, he commands the
Royal Robes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o be produced, and in them <hi>Hiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi>
to be attired, and ſo attired to go up on the Scaffold,
which was by this time covered with purple Velvet,
fringed and embroydered with Gold, and there to ſeat
himſelf in a Throne on purpoſe prepared, with a
Crown on his head, the Scepter in his hand, and the
Sword born before him.</p>
            <p>The King thus forced to act over a Pageant-like
ſhew of Majeſty, to adorn the tryumph of treachery,
and to add ſolemnity to cruelty, ſits in the Throne,
with a heavy but imperious look, that the Beams of
Majeſty ſeemed to unite and centre in his contracted
brow, and with a ſtrange kind of force to write a Law,
not of pity, but of a reverential adoring a King though
diſtreſt.</p>
            <p>And whilſt he thus ſits, ſometimes looking with an
auſtere and ſcornful eye on <hi>Pandion,</hi> ſometimes darting
threats with a dauntleſs look at his ſouldiers, <hi>Pandion</hi>
cauſes Heralds to proclame;</p>
            <p>Firſt, That he had ignobly uſurped the Royal digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and detained it by force and fraud, from himſelf the
lawful heir; which words pronounced, an Officer of
State, appointed for that purpoſe, took away the Crown,
and ſet it on <hi>Pandions</hi> head.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That he had unjuſtly uſurped the power of
adminiſtration of Juſtice, to the general endamage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the whole Realm, and to the particular inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the juſt and lawful Soveraign; which pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
they took away the Sword, and cauſed it to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to <hi>Pandion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, That as he had uſurped the ſupreme pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of judicature, ſo of Government; this proclam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they took from him the Scepter, and gave it <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:52129:170"/>
Fourth, That he had uſurped the Royal Throne,
from the lawful inheritor; this was no ſooner with a
lowder voice than ordinary proclaimed, than the King
was compelled to ariſe out of the Throne.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, It was proclaimed, that as he was by univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
conſent of the whole Kingdom, depoſed from all
ſoveraignty, ſo he muſt be deſpoyled of all Enſigns of
Majeſty, that <hi>Pandion</hi> might be therewith inveſted, to
whom by an indubitate ſucceſſion they belonged; upon
which words <hi>Hiarbas</hi> was deveſted of the purple Robe,
and forced to aſſiſt in the inveſtiture of <hi>Pandion;</hi> which
done, <hi>Pandion</hi> ſits down in the Throne, and was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
King of <hi>Tbeſſalia,</hi> whilſt <hi>Hiarbas</hi> was lead
away a priſoner into the Caſtle, chained in fetters of
Gold; who as he went would have ſpoke to the ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
who conſiſted moſt of ſouldiers, but he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
by great acclamations of the people, that
cryed, <hi>God ſave King</hi> Pandion.</p>
            <p>Thus was this great Prince, one not undeſerving
that title and power, had he not uſed unjuſt means to
entitle him to that power, one whoſe ſoul was richly
furniſht with all thoſe endowments of Fortitude,
Juſtice, Prudence, and Temperance, which are the
ſimples that conſtitute a true Princely mind, and
one who never before was unfortunate, unleſs in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too great a courter of Fortune; thus (I ſay) was
this ſo brave, ſo great a Prince on the ſudden thrown
from the top of the higheſt pinacle of honor and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,
being lead captive at Noon, for the world to
behold a clear mirror of Fortunes prodigious levity,
and an exact model of the inconſtancy of humane
felicity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pandion</hi> having ſat a while in great ſtate, ariſes out
of his Throne, comes down from the Scaffold, and
goes into his Caſtle attended with great numbers of
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:52129:171"/>
Lords and Commanders, and guarded with ſouldiers,
<hi>Hiarbas</hi>'s General all the while bearing the ſword be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him; where having pauſed a while on this ſudden,
and no leſs ſtrange, than ſudden mutation, the thoughts
of all men being at a ſtand, and not able to flye higher
with admiration, to ſee an imperious ſword melted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an imperial Diadem, to ſee a Crown formed into
fetters, treachery to generate Royalty, and Royalty
to degenerate into miſery.</p>
            <p>In fine, to ſee him who late thundered from a
Throne, whoſe voice was power, and whoſe looks
were Majeſty, to be dethron'd with the thunder of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
plundered of all power, and deplum'd of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty:
They at laſt fell into conſultation, how to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
that power by prudence, they had acquired by
policy; great fortunes requiring as great force of
mind, to conquer thoſe difficulties that attended them
once gotten, as they did force of body to conquer
thoſe enemies that oppoſed their getting. After ſome
time ſpent in bandying to and fro, the various exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of State, the mutynies, ſeditious uproars and
tumults, that are the uſual effects of alterations in a
Monarchical Government, and the beſt means to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the one, and ſubdue the other, the reſult of all
was this, that being <hi>Pandion</hi> would be thought to come
to the Throne, not as a conqueror, but inheritor; and
conſidering that the manyfold exactions and impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
laid upon the people by <hi>Hiarbas</hi> to maintain his
Army, had provoked them againſt both himſelf and
them, the ſad effect whereof was palpably viſible in
his depoſition and deſtruction; and that the greateſt
part of the Kingdom was already in ſubjection and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the command of his Garriſons, and it was eaſie to
raiſe a force to ſubdue that part that ſhould rebell, that
therefore his Armies ſhould be disbanded, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:52129:171"/>
of plenary ſatisfaction for their ſervice, which
(they ſaid) would be a great engagement to his people
to Loyalty, when they ſaw him eſteem their love, as
his principal protection.</p>
            <p>And as for the General, that had done ſuch eminent
and loyal ſervice, he ſhould be eminently and Royally
rewarded, and diſmiſſed with his me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to march at his
leiſure. And as for a Life-guard, it was thought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
decent, than convenient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not any neceſſity, but
ceremony of State requiring it. Therefore a certain
number of choice Warlike Gentlemen were culled out,
to guard his Perſon, whereof <hi>Celadon</hi> was made Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander.</p>
            <p>Theſe things concluded on, were accordingly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted;
the Army being diſmi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, with great thanks for
their gallant ſervice; the perſon imployed in that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
telling them how highly the King reſented their
fidelity, and e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eemed their valour, and that his rewards
ſhould be parallel to his reſentment and eſteem.</p>
            <p>This done, they further conſult about the diſpoſal
of <hi>Hiarbas</hi>'s Perſon; but as they ſat in Council, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> ſome making plain ſpeeches the Keys
to their thoughts; others, Pathetical Orations, as win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
to their deſires, but others attiring both their
thoughts and deſires in ambiguous Expreſſions, which
like changable Taffata might variouſly reflect their
minds; they heard in a Room underneath, ſuch a
conſort of doleful moans, as expreſt the wofull muſick
of a grieved mind. Somtimes they might hear groans
formed into words, and words transformed into groans,
that ſorrow ſeemed to build an Airy Pyramis, under
which it entombed all joy; the deep-fetcht groans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
the Baſis, as the ſhrill cries the Spire. <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dion</hi>
hearing that, gave command, that the Authors of
thoſe lamentations ſhould be brought before him, to
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:52129:172"/>
give an account wherefore they temporize with ſorrow,
when joy was the Genius of thoſe ſmiling hours. No
ſooner was the command given forth, than obeyed, the
Perſon being cauſed to appear, and no ſooner appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
than was known to be <hi>Danpion,</hi> by many of the
Lords that had acquaintance with him, whilſt he had
acquaintance with a bright proſperity in <hi>Hiarbas</hi>'s
Court; but to <hi>Pandion</hi> only to be that ſervant of <hi>Hiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi>
whom he had ſentenced to dye; which when he
ſaw not executed, he ſeemed like one that travelled
far from himſelf, till the conſideration that variety of
occaſions might well divert the mind of <hi>Celadon,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
the farther progreſs of his thoughts, and
gave him occaſion to charge ſtrictly, that executi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n be
ſpeedily performed, threatning with a look ſo ſevere
as ſeemed to antedate his threatning, no leſs than death
for the leaſt delay.</p>
            <p>This ſaid, the Priſoner was led away; but as he went,
none but might have ſeen in him, a perfect image of
captiv'd courage; his rage, not becauſe he was to dye,
but that any other than a victorious Launce ſhould
force him to dye, though impriſoned in his thoughts by
reſolution, yet fluſht forth at his eyes; his countenance
all the while repreſenting the undaunted conſtancy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
wherewith he armed his mind, now he was to run the
gauntlet with an invincible Enemy, yet at the ſame time
attiring his looks in ſuch a graceful Majeſty, as if this
was but his marriage-day with Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
rather to what might become his own Princely
greatneſs, than the ſordidneſs of his pale Spouſe.</p>
            <p>But juſt as he was going out of the door, on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
a voice bolted forth theſe words, <hi>A Crown becoms
not a Peaſants head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pandion</hi> hearing that, cryed out, What Treaſon's
that? But ſcarce had the cadence of his voyce put a
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:52129:172"/>
period to his ſpeech, but a fearfull ſpectacle ſoon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
his fearfull Interrogation, and deprived him of
his fear, by preſenting the evil he feared; for preſently
there iſſued out from under the Hangings, men clad in
Armour, with naked Swords, who ſeized on <hi>Pandion</hi>
in the midſt of all his Pomp, whilſt he was dictating
Lawes with his Looks, and commanding obſervance
with his Brow, and hale him out of his Throne, diſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray
him of his Robes, rob him of that golden Jayl that
impriſon'd his head, and plunder him of all his ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor:
So ſoon can a tempeſt of miſery waſh away a new
gilded Fortune: Thus every Jewel of a Princes Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
is a Star of moſt malignant influence to Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</p>
            <p>Scarce this was done, before <hi>Danpion</hi> was call'd
back with ſpeed; and no ſooner turned, than received
by <hi>Hiarbas</hi>'s General, with all humility upon his knees;
whom <hi>Danpion</hi> ſtrictly obſerving, he knew to be his

and with great joy embraced him, telling him, that
now he had found him to be a compoſition of ſincere
friendſhip, and that his ſoul was a meer extract of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

Theſe things thus ſtrangely brought about, Royal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel

<hi>Hiarbas</hi>'s ſpeedy releaſment, and that he ſhould

known to him, returning him infinite thanks for all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
favours, telling him what a high-ſumm'd debt
he had contracted from his Royal goodneſs.</p>
            <p>After which, he began to clear himſelf of that inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable
incivility, <hi>Baſcanius</hi>'s malice and treachery had
reproched him withall, confeſſing what flames <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phigenia</hi>
had inkindled in his heart, which neither life
nor death—but as he was farther ſpeaking, the thoughts
of <hi>Amphigenia</hi> divorced his mind from every thing but

            <p>And as for <hi>Pandion,</hi> the exceſs of joy at the firſt
ſight almoſt took away the act of ſeeing, and pillaged
his memory of thoſe high-flown expreſſions that the
raptures of love had created in his fancy; but in an
humble manner begged pardon for whatſoever of his,
that in the ſtricteſt ſenſe might be interpreted rudeneſs,
which (he ſaid) proceeded from an irreſiſtible impulſe
of affection: And further he craved of her, that ſince
it was not her pleaſure, ſo much as to inparadize his
Form in her thoughts, (for her eyes were ſomthing
caſt aſide upon the wall, ſhewing a lofty kind of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility)
but to make an inanimate creature the object
of his envy, that yet ſhe would permit his lips, as Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims
from his heart, to ſacrifize the pure Oblations of
his Love upon her hand, that pure ſhrine of pureneſs,
and there to inſcribe its Image, that when the beauties
of her hand, might challenge a glance from her eyes,
that glance might challenge remembrance from her
thoughts, of the humbleſt of her ſervants, and the moſt
paſſionately devoted to her Princely Vertues.</p>
            <p>Having ſaid this, he adventured to take her hand,
and ſteal the riches of a Kiſs, from that ſoft and delicate
Treaſury; which ſhe permitted, with a countenance
that ſhewed rather how ſhe hated her captivity, than
loved her Captive.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſalutations being paſt, <hi>Amphigenia</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
to ſome Ladies, that hearing of all theſe Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
were come to congratulate their Princeſſes ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and to wait upon her home to the Palace.</p>
            <p>After which <hi>Pandion</hi> accompanyed by <hi>Hiarbas,</hi>
attended by all the Lords and Gentlemen, guarded by
<hi>Athalus</hi>'s Army (having left <hi>Celadon</hi> Commander

ſteeped ſome time in an Ocean of delights, and
bribed it with the choyceſt of Pleaſures, to mend its
pace, <hi>Pandion</hi> was crowned in the chief City of <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
with all the joy and contentment, pomp and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry,
as might either beget Loyalty to Soveraignty,
or Reverence to Majeſty; both which, that the people
might expreſs, they ſent up ſuch volleys of acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to the Clouds, as if they meant to ſtorm Heaven,
and plunder it of its choyſeſt glories, wherewith to
crown their King.</p>
            <p>After which, <hi>Hiarbas</hi> would have departed to his
own Kingdom of <hi>Caonia,</hi> together with his Daughter
<hi>Amphigenia,</hi> there to have ſpent the ſmall remainder
of his dayes: But <hi>Pandion</hi> would by no means permit
it, telling him, that the whole Kingdom ſhould be as
much at his command, as ever, only reſerving the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
to himſelf, acquainting him alſo, what Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
of affection his Daughters worth had laid upon
him; for which reaſons <hi>Hiarbas</hi> conſented to take up
his abode in <hi>Pandion</hi>'s Court, chiefly perſwaded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
by the hopes of having ſuch an incomparable
Prince for his Son in Law, by whoſe happy conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with his Daughter in marriage, the Soveraignty of
<hi>Theſſalia</hi> might run in his Reins, which was ever the
higheſt aym of his ambition.</p>
            <p>Having thus led my Hero through all difficulties,
into the Throne, and layd him in the lap of Fortune,
it may be expected, that to compleat his happineſs,
I ſhould have placed him in the Arms of his beloved
<hi>Amphigenia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they that know the tedious intricacy, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing
(but yet fidling) difficulty there is in getting
the love of a Coy Miſtreſs, will I hope excuſe me, if I
give my Pen a <hi>quietus eſt,</hi> after ſo long a Pilgrimage.
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:52129:174"/>
I eſteem Ambition a more tolerable, and Maſculine
diſtraction than Love: And therefore I had rather
place my Hero in the more noble embraces of Fortune,
than in the ſoft Effeminate Arms of a Lady; about
which, I have not impertinent thoughts enow to
ſpend.</p>
            <p>Poſſibly I may be alſo thought too hard-hearted, in
leaving my other Lovers ſuccourleſs in their miſeries,
and not leading them out of their Labyrinths, by the
Threed of my diſcourſe: But the vulgar Rule of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

may ſalve all, That the Knight muſt kill the
Gyant, and get the Lady.</p>
            <p>And thoſe that are not pleaſed with this Concluſion,
let them throw away as many idle hours as I have done,
and they may compleat that Story, which hath now
quite jaded and dull'd my Pen.</p>
