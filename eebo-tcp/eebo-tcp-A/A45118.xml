         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Works of God call for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Obſervation from all who
are Spectators of them, and are
very inſtructive to the Children of Men.
By theſe God may be ſaid to ſpeak
Once, yea Twice, yet Man perceives it
not. We are with the utmoſt Diligence
to apply our ſelves to the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of the Voice of God in them,
Pſal. 111. 2. <hi>The Works of the
Lord are great,</hi> particularly the
Works of Creation, which do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſpeak with a loud Voice to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the Earth, <hi>Pſal. 19. 1,
2, 3. The Heavens declare the
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:37649:3"/>
Glory of God, and the Firmament
ſheweth his Handy-work. Day
unto Day uttereth Speech,</hi> &amp;c.
The viſible Heavens, ſo vaſt and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
richly adorned with Sun, Moon,
and Stars, which are admirable in their
Courſe, and powerful in their Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
theſe are a legible Book, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we may read what a glorious Being
God is, who is the Maker and Former
of theſe glorious Creatures: and from
the Conſideration thereof reflect on Man
as a vile contemptible Creature; <hi>Pſal.
8. 3, 4. When I conſider thy Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
the Work of thy Fingers, the
Moon and the Stars which thou
haſt ordained, what is Man that
thou art mindful of him?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And as the Works of Creation are
great, ſo the Works of Providence
(whereby he governs, preſerves, orders
and diſpoſes of all things in the World)
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:37649:3"/>
are great alſo, eſpecially in and for his
Church and People; the Infinite Power,
Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
manifeſted in them. Theſe
Works of God are to be narrowly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected,
found out, and ſearched into
by all thoſe that take Pleaſure therein:
And it is a God-provoking Sin not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the Works of the Lord, and the
Operations of his Hands. For this Sin
God threatens to deſtroy a People, and
not build them up, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28. 5. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
God goes out of his uſual Courſe
of Providence, and works miraculouſly
(an eminent Inſtance whereof we have
in this Narrative). This he doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
immediately, <hi>Mark 6. 52. Joh.</hi>
2. 11. ſometimes mediately, <hi>Mark 9.
38, 39. Acts</hi> 4. 16, 22.</p>
            <p>Here might be conſidered what the
glorious Deſign of God is in his miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Works.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:37649:4"/>
As, 1. To convince an Atheiſtical
Generation of Men, that there is a God
that acts above the Power of Nature or
natural Cauſes, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5. 15.</p>
            <p>2. That thoſe who contemn and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
value the Lord Jeſus Chriſt (through
Faith in whoſe Name <hi>Lepers</hi> were
cleanſed, the Blind received their
Sight, a Bloody Iſſue ſtopped, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)
might be convinced that he was the true
<hi>Meſſiah,</hi> yea God as well as Man.</p>
            <p>Though Chriſt came in the Form of a
Servant, yet the Glory of his Deity
ſparkled forth in divers Ways, and on
divers Occaſions, particularly in his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
Works, which none but a God
could do, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 3. &amp; 2 11. Chriſt
turns Water into Wine, and thereby
ſhewed forth his Glory, even the Glory
of the only begotten of the Father.</p>
            <p>The Diſciples of Chriſt wrought
Miracles; but this they did in the Name
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:37649:4"/>
of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. Whereas Christ
wrought his by his own Divine Power,
which may juſtly ſtrike a Damp upon
thoſe who of late have been ſo unhappy as
to deny the Divinity of our Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p>3. Chriſt's miraculous Works are
deſigned to ſtrengthen the Faith of his
People; <hi>John</hi> 2. 11. When Chriſt
had wrought that Miracle of turning
Water into Wine, it's ſaid, <hi>his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
believed on him.</hi> They believed
before, but now they were confirmed in
their Faith.</p>
            <p>And if ſo, then Chriſt's curing the
Leproſy and other Diſtempers in our
day, which in the Judgment of the
ableſt Phyſicians were incurable, is not
ſlightly to be paſſed over.</p>
            <p>That divers miraculous Cures have
been wrought of late, immediately by the
Divine Power of Chriſt without hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Means, is not to be denied by any
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:37649:5"/>
but ſuch as are hardning themſelves
againſt Chriſt and his Works, as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
Jews did, who though Chriſt
had done many mighty Works amongst
them, yet they believed not on him,
<hi>John</hi> 12. 37.</p>
            <p>Amongst other wonderful Cures
which the Lord Jeſus hath lately
wrought, this ſeems not to be the leaſt
which he hath wrought on the Body of
<hi>Suſannah Arch;</hi> of which this Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
gives an impartial Account.</p>
            <p>She is known to be a Woman of an
holy Converſation, enjoys much Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God, and is a Member of
a Congregation, meeting in <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire-Square</hi>
in <hi>London.</hi> She lives
at <hi>Battle-Bridg</hi> in <hi>Southwark,</hi> where
any that deſire it may receive further
Satisfaction.</p>

            <head>A NARRATIVE of the
Miraculous Cure of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſannah
Arch, of a Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy
and Ptyſick, wherewith
for ſome Years paſt ſhe had
been ſorely afflicted.</head>
            <p>I <hi>Suſannah Arch</hi> do ſolemnly declare, in
the Fear of God, that my Diſtemper
began about four Years ago with an
extraordinary Itching and Scurf on my
Head, and afterwards it ſpread over my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
This continued about three Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I adviſed with any Phyſician to know
what it was; and then my Husband died,
whoſe Death was attended with many ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating
Circumſtances, occaſioning much
Sorrow and Grief; all which conduced to
increaſe my Diſtemper. Under my great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
of Body and Mind I was lamenting
my ſelf, ſaying, What, a poor diſtreſſed
Widow! a poor afflicted Widow! Then
the Lord was pleaſed to give me in that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37649:6"/>
Scripture, <hi>Rom. 8. 32. He that ſpared not his
own Son, but gave him up for us all, how ſhall
he not with him freely give us all things?</hi> This
I took as a Bond from the Lord, wherein he
was pleaſed graciouſly to bind himſelf to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
all my Neceſſities, which was much to
my Support at that time. Immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
my Husband's Burial, being left in a poor
and deſolate Condition, that Scripture came
to my Mind, <hi>Job 1. 21. Naked came I out of
my Mother's Womb, and naked ſhall I return
again. The Lord hath given, and the Lord
hath taken away, and bleſſed be the Name of
the Lord.</hi> Under theſe ſad Exerciſes I was
help'd to conſider, that my outward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
was not worſe than my Lords and
Maſter's; of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Matth. 8. 20.
The Foxes have Holes, and the Birds of the Air
have Neſts, but the Son of Man hath not wh<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e
to lay his Head.</hi> Then was I help'd to ſay,
I have loſt all, and yet have all; and to
plead with God in the Words of <hi>Jacob,</hi>
Gen. 32. 12. <hi>Thou ſaidſt, I will do thee good.</hi>
Theſe and many other precious Words were
powerfully impreſſed on my Soul for my
Support and Comfort.</p>
            <p>After theſe Troubles my Diſtemper much
increaſed, and then I adviſed with Mr. <hi>Forty</hi>
an Apothecary, who told me my Diſtemper
was a Leproſy. I asked him whether it was
curable: He told me, it was not curable.
Then was I adviſed by his Wife to go to one
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37649:6"/>
Mrs. <hi>Griffin,</hi> who is skilful in curing Scald
Heads, and ſhe perſwaded me to go to the
Hoſpital, but I found a Reluctancy in my
ſelf thereto, having a Perſwaſion in my Mind
from the time that Mr. <hi>Forty</hi> told me it was
incurable, that Jeſus Chriſt would cure it.
Nevertheleſs conſidering that Paſſage of the
Woman that had the Bloody Iſſue, though
ſhe ſpent all on Phyſicians, yet this did not
hinder her being cured by Chriſt when ſhe
came to him: So I concluded my going to
the Hoſpital might not hinder Chriſt's curing
me: Thereupon I was ſatisfied in my ſelf to
go; and when I preſented my ſelf to the
Phyſician and Chirurgeons, they told me
it was a Leproſy, and asked me what I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
of them. I deſired to be an Out-pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
and they preſcribed me ſome things,
but I had no Faith in the Succeſs of them,
and ſo took but one Doſe, and threw the
reſt away, looking to an higher Hand for
my Cure. However I went a ſecond time,
and then they who gave out the Medicines,
ſeeing my Diſtemper, told me, it was in
vain to ſpend my time in attending any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on them, for it was a Leproſy, and
could not be cured. Not long after this I
was ſent by a Friend of mine, on her own
Account, to Dr. <hi>Bourne,</hi> and I took that
Opportunity to ſhew him my Diſtemper:
And when he ſaw it, he lift up his Hands,
ſaying, Good Lord have Mercy upon thee!
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37649:7"/>
it is a Leproſy. He likewiſe told me, there
might be ſomething given to curb it (but
not to cure it) if I had wherewithal to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray
the Charge. I told him I was a poor
Widow, and ſo concerned my ſelf no more
with him. I went away from him full of
Comfort, having this Perſwaſion, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt would be my Phyſician, and would
cure me.</p>
            <p>After this I was ſent by the ſame Friend,
and on her own Account, to Dr. <hi>Clarke,</hi>
and took that Opportunity to diſcover my
Caſe to him, who knowing me, ſympathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
with me, ſaying, Alas, poor Woman,
it is a Leproſy! I asked him whether it could
be cured: He told me, that ſomething might
be given to check it, but not to cure it; and
that if I would go to Mr. <hi>Humes</hi> an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary,
he would give Directions to him,
and would do what he could for me. But
having no Hopes of Cure from any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Means, I concerned my ſelf no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with him in this Matter. One Reaſon
why I had no Expectation of Cure from Man
was, the occurring of that Scripture fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to my Mind, <hi>Mat. 8. 2. Lord, if
thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean.</hi> This I
was enabled to plead before him with ſome
Degree of Confidence that at laſt I ſhould
prevail.</p>
            <p>After this another Friend and Neighbour
of mine being ſick, deſired me to go for her
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37649:7"/>
to Dr. <hi>Nicholls;</hi> and when I had diſcourſed
with him concerning my Friend, I asked
him what he thought of my Diſtemper? who
anſwered, Alas! poor Woman, how came
you by this Surfeit? I asked him what the
Diſtemper was? and he likewiſe told me, as
the others had done before, that it was a
Leproſy, and incurable.</p>
            <p>This I can truly ſay, that all along my
Faith was fix'd on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: It
was on him I did and was reſolved to rely,
who in the Days of his Fleſh, when on Earth,
cured all Diſeaſes and Sickneſſes among the
People; and I was confident, that he had
the ſame Power now he was glorified in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
as he had in the Days of his Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>There is one thing I think good to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
<hi>viz.</hi> when I conſidered that I was a
poor polluted unclean Leper, I was under
ſome doubt (though afterwards I concluded
it was from Satan) whether I might and
ought to come to the Congregation of the
Lord's People to whom I belong, to partake
of that Bleſſed Ordinance of the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
amongſt them. Labouring under ſtrong
Conflicts about this Matter, as I was going
to the Congregation, that Text came with
Power on my Soul, <hi>Gal. 5. 1. Stand faſt in
the Liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made you
free, and be not intangled again with the Yoke
of Bondage.</hi> By this Text I underſtood that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37649:8"/>
the Law of the Leper, being part of the
Ceremonial Law, is done away; and ſo that
Doubt was removed.</p>
            <p>Upon the laſt Day of <hi>May,</hi> 1694. at Night,
when I was aſleep in my Bed, I was pleading
with God in thoſe Words of the Pſalmiſt,
Pſal. 57. 2. <hi>I will cry unto God moſt High, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him that performeth all things for me:</hi> And
then I thought I ſaw a Man ſtanding by me,
and laying his Hand on me, ſaying, <hi>I will
be thou clean.</hi> I anſwered, <hi>Lord, if thou ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
the Word, it is done.</hi> To which I received
this Reply, <hi>All things are poſſible to him that
believeth.</hi> I anſwered, <hi>Lord, I believe, help
thou my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief.</hi> To which it was anſwered,
<hi>He that believes, needs not to ſay, but is whole
every whit,</hi> (the Hand being all the while
upon my Hand) and thereupon I awaked,
and perceived that it was a Dream. From
that time (though I grew worſe and worſe)
I was ſtrongly perſwaded that I ſhould be
made whole.</p>
            <p>The next Morning a Chriſtian Friend of
mine came to ſee me, and brought a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
with her, telling me, that ſhe had
brought one that could cure the Leproſy.
I then ſaid to the Woman, Can you cure
the Leproſy? She ſaid, Yes. But ſaid I,
You ſhall not cure me, for I have thrown
my ſelf on the Phyſician of Value, and he
will cure me: And though you, or all the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37649:8"/>
greateſt Doctors or Chirurgions in <hi>London,</hi>
would give me a great Sum of Money, you
ſhould none of you take me in hand.</p>
            <p>After this I had divers Conflicts and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
to weaken my Confidence; but God
was pleaſed to give in divers ſeaſonable
Words for my Relief, and for the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of my Faith: As at one time that Text
came with Power on my Soul, <hi>Mark 11. 22.
Have Faith in God.</hi> And at another time
that Text, <hi>John 11. 40. Said I not unto thee,
that if thou wouldſt believe thou ſhouldſt ſee the
Glory of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And at another time that Text, <hi>Heb. 10.
35. Caſt not away your Confidence which hath
great Recompence of Reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas I had been afflicted with a
Ptyſick for many Years, wherewith I was laid
vp every Winter; in <hi>November</hi> laſt it pleaſed
the Lord to remove that Diſtemper, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Uſe of any humane Means. And
this was to me a Token for Good, that God
would likewiſe cure me of my Leproſy.
Soon after this, being at Mr. <hi>Beverley</hi>'s Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and hearing the People talk of a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Cure of one that was lame, I asked
one that ſat by me concerning it: and ſhe
told me, that a Maid that had been lame 17
Years was miraculouſly cured on a ſudden.
Then I told her, I was waiting at the Pool,
believing that I ſhould be made whole. From
that time my Heart was drawn out to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37649:9"/>
wreſtle more earneſtly with God for Cure,
crying out, <hi>Lord! why not I? why not I,
a poor Leper?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>December</hi> my Diſtemper growing worſe
and worſe, both on my Head and Body, I
met with ſome inward Struglings, but was
help'd to ſay, in the Words of <hi>Job, I know,
O Lord, that thou canſt do every thing.</hi> I was
likewiſe help'd to ſay, from that of the three
Worthies, <hi>Dan. 3. 17. My God whom I ſerve
is able to deliver me:</hi> However I am reſolved
to truſt in him.</p>
            <p>And now to give a true and faithful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
how I was healed.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>26th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> at Night I went
to Bed, as bad as ever I was; and in the
Night I had grievous and ſore Temptations
from my Adverſary, who told me I had no
Faith; and that if I had Faith I might be
healed; thoſe Words being caſt into my
Mind, <hi>O ye of little Faith:</hi> and I was temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to think I had no Faith, and that God
did not love me, but I perceived this was to
beat me off from my Confidence in God.
Then was I help'd to look back to former
Experience, and remembred that about 30
Years ago, when I was under great Diſtreſs
about the State of my Soul, being under a
deep Senſe of my Sin. I was help'd to caſt
my Soul on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And
from that Conſideration many times ſince,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37649:9"/>
when I have been in great Diſtreſs, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to my outward Condition, I have been
enabled to caſt my bodily Concerns upon
him; and then I cried out, Lord, I have
caſt my Soul upon thee, and my Body upon
thee, and now I am reſolved to caſt all my
Diſeaſes upon thee. Then was I help'd to
plead with God, ſaying, Lord, if I have true
Faith, if thou loveſt me, if I have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in Chriſt, take away this Diſtemper
before I die. Then Satan ſuggeſted to me,
that I had ſinned with a witneſs in that I
had limited God. But I was help'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
the ſame Petitions to the Lord, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I had not limited the Lord, only that
he would cure me before I die. Then that
Scripture was brought to my Mind, <hi>Jam. 4.
7. Reſiſt the Devil, and he will flee from thee.</hi>
From which I was encouraged to reſiſt him,
knowing that he was a conquered Enemy.
Then I lay quiet and with a compoſed Mind
till Morning. Next Day I found a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Alteration, being much better and more
chearful, which was diſcerned by a Friend
of mine, who told me, that ſhe did perceive
that I was much better.</p>
            <p>The next Night after this, which was
Thurſday Night, as I was in my Bed, I put
my Hand to my Head, firſt on one ſide, and
then on the other, and felt Skin on both
Sides of it, which at firſt was ſurprizing and
amazing to me. Then I ſaid, <hi>Lord Jeſus!
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37649:10"/>
haſt thou begun? thou wilt carry it on.</hi> When
I aroſe in the Morning, and had taken off
my Head-clothes, I found the Scurf was
gone from off my Head, only there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
like a little Cap on the Crown of my
Head, which was eaſily taken off with a
Comb, which I made uſe of for that end:
And then appeared firm Skin all over my
Head. At the ſame time my Diſtemper,
which was ſpread over my whole Body from
Head to Foot, even to my very Toes, was
likewiſe taken away. And whereas I had
neither Skin nor Hair on my Head before,
my Hair is now grown to the Admiration of
them that behold it. And to this Day,
through the Lord's Goodneſs, I remain free
both from Leproſy and Ptyſick.</p>

               <hi>I Robert Hume</hi> do declare, in the
fear of the All-ſeeing, Heart-ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God, concerning <hi>Suſannah Arch,</hi>
whom I have known for ſeveral Years, as
followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. She was, to my Knowledg, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly
afflicted with an <hi>Aſthma,</hi> common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called a Ptyſick; yea I have ſeen her
ſcarce able to go along the Street ſo faſt
as a Child of two Years old. When her
Husband was ill of the Sickneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he died, if ſhe went but croſs the
Chamber, ſhe would pant like one almoſt
expiring, inſomuch that I thought ſhe
was more like to die than he: and ſo
ſhe commonly was in the Winter, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in ſuch Weather as increaſes that
Diſtemper.</p>
            <p>2. One Day ſhe came to me, which I think
was about <hi>July</hi> laſt, and ſhowed me her
Head, ſaying, Sir, Can you tell me what
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37649:12"/>
I have got here? I anſwered, It is a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſy
(for ſo I think it was indeed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Deſcription of the beſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors):
Ay, ſays ſhe, ſo every Body tells
me, for I have been at the Hoſpital, and
they all ſay ſo of it, and tell me there
is no Cure for it. I adviſed her to go
to Doctor <hi>Clark,</hi> to hear what he would
ſay of it. In a little time after ſhe came
and told we, ſhe had ſhowed it to Dr.
<hi>Clark,</hi> and that he was of the ſame Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the reſt, however deſired to ſpeak
with me about it: I went to him, but do
not punctually remember what he ſaid,
but this I remember, that he look'd upon
it to be a very ſad difficult Caſe; ſo that
I all along took it for granted that he
look'd upon it to be a <hi>Leproſy,</hi> and that
there was no Hope of Cure, for he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
nothing for her.</p>
            <p>Now as to theſe Matters I do further
declare;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> As to her <hi>Aſthma:</hi> I could not
but admire when I was with her a little
after ſhe was cured of the <hi>Leproſy,</hi> and
ſaw how ſhe went a pretty way along the
Street, and up a pair of Stairs, and that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37649:12"/>
in froſty Weather, without puffing and
blowing, as ſhe was uſed to do. I did
take particular Notice how ſhe could ſpeak
without fetching her Breath longer than
a great many that never were afflicted with
any ſuch Indiſpoſition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> As for the <hi>Leproſy:</hi> It was no
leſs Wonder to me, that when I came to
look upon that which formerly was in my
Judgment Leprous as Snow, I found now
was become as the Fleſh of a young Child.
I do verily believe ſhe is wholly cured of
it, there being all Symptoms of Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and the Hair does grow apace. Let
any doubtful, make what Search they will,
I am not afraid of being found in a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
