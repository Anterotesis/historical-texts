            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is well known that there are in the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> a great many Learned Persons, that do not approve of all which it teacheth, and that do earnestly long for a Reformation, although they remain within its bosome. But it is no less true that there's but very few, that have the courage to make their thoughts known, and 'tis no hard matter to guess at the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of it.</p>
            <p>In the last Age, one <hi>Picherel,</hi> and some others of great note, wrote solid Treatises on certain matters of Controversie, and explain'd themselves just as Protestants do now. And in the present, <hi>Monsieur de Marca</hi> did the same, on the Doctine of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> and <hi>Barnes,</hi> an Eminent <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictine,</hi> on most of the principal Questions wherein Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants differ from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But as if every one feared such usage as Father <hi>Paolo,</hi> and poor <hi>Barnes</hi> found, for the Liberty they had taken, the works of these sincere and learned Men, have almost always been supprest during their Life-time, and not suffer'd to come abroad till after their Decease.</p>
            <p>It is therefore something more than ordinary, to behold the Work of a Person now living, and of the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that dares shew the like affection for the Reformation of his Church in the Doctrine of the
<pb facs="tcp:66013:3"/>
               <hi>Eucharist,</hi> and that heartily wishes, the Bishops and Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> would take it into their serious consideration. This Person is considerable for his Quality, but much more for his great Learning. He was an intimate friend of the late <hi>Monsieur de Launoy's,</hi> a noted Divine of the Faculty of <hi>Paris,</hi> who mightily desired to see a free Council, wherein Men might speak their thoughts touching the Reforming of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church; and it plainly appears he was of the same judgment with this Eminent Person, touching the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reader may rest assured that the Author's Manuscript Copy has been exactly follow'd in the Edition of this Work; which not only his Letters, now in our Hands, will justifie, but also the Original of these Papers, which he sent to a Friend to be Printed.</p>
            <p>It is to be hoped the World will not take it ill, if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this Work be not more particularly described, which could not be done without exposing him to the malice of those who use all manner of ways to destroy such of their party, as do own the Truth. It nearly behoves the Bishops and Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> to make some serious Reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what the Author thought fit to represent to them concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> The same might have been said to the other Articles of the <hi>Romish</hi> belief, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by Protestants, as so many additions to the ancient Faith of the Primitive Christians; which are impos'd upon Mens consciences by the Clergy, by such unheard-of ways, and that are so contrary to the nature of Religion. If such Remonstrances as these, are not of sufficient force to make them change their proceedings against Protestants; they will at least serve to shew their Injustice before Men, and will one day aggravate their condemnation before the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of God.</p>

            <head>AN HISTORICAL TREATISE OF <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> Written by one of the <hi>CHURCH</hi> of <hi>ROME.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Bishops of <hi>France</hi> in their last <hi>Assembly</hi> held at <hi>Paris</hi> in the year 1682. compos'd a <hi>Pastoral Letter</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Clergy of <hi>France</hi>'s Method to judge of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith.</note> addressed to the Protestants, to invite them to return to the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And because in order to put an end to their differences in Matters of Religion, some <hi>Rule</hi> must be agreed on to be received by the different Parties; they laid down several Principles which they called <hi>Methods,</hi> as fit to be made use of, whereby to judge what should be received as an <hi>Article of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Fourth <hi>Method</hi> they laid down as a <hi>Maxim,</hi> that the true means to discern what relates to matter of Faith, or not; is to see if the Article which is to be admitted, was always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved as Matter of Faith; that is to say, <hi>that</hi> the French Bishops admitted in their pastoral Letter, the Maxim which <hi>Vincentius Lyrinensis</hi> left us above 1100. years ago; <hi>That great Care must be taken to retain in the Catholick Church, what hath been believed every where, by all, and at all times,</hi> as being the true Means whereby to discern what is Matter of Faith, and what is not. This same is the Rule given by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth, who obliges them to swear in the profession of Faith, added to the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:66013:6"/>
That the Holy Scriptures should not be Interpreted, <note n="†" place="margin">Secundum unanimem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensum Patrum.</note> 
               <hi>But by the unanimous consent of the Ancient Fathers.</hi>

            <p>The Protestants have thought this Maxim so reasonable, that Monsieur <hi>Larroque</hi> a French Minister, saith in his Preface to the <hi>History of the Eucharist,</hi> that he believes there is no Man of Sense, <note place="margin">Admitted by the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants.</note> but ought to admit of it. And it was received as a <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> by the Reform'd <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> by <hi>Philip Melancthon,</hi> by <hi>Peter Martyr, Gallasius, Scultetus, Casaubon, Grotius, Vessius, Beza,</hi> and by <hi>Gesselius,</hi> (who recites their Authorities,) in the Preface of his <hi>History of Memorable things from the Creation of the World, to the year of Christ,</hi> 1125.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore that the Bishops of <hi>France</hi> have propos'd to <note place="margin">Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation to be examined by it.</note> us so just a <hi>Method,</hi> let us examine if the Doctrine of <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation</hi> be a <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Faith;</hi> and prove it, not because the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> has defin'd it so; Or that the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Lateran</hi> in the year 1215. suppos'd it to be so, <hi>non quia ipsam quam tenemus fidem commendaverit Milevitanus Optatus, vel Mediolanensis Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brosius, aut quia Collegarum Nostrorum Conciliis ipsa praedicta est,</hi> saith S. <hi>Austin</hi> against the Donatists, <hi>De unit.

But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause 'tis contain'd in the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> and understood in that Sense by the unanimous consent of the <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi> that have gone before us.</p>
            <p>This is what we now undertake to perform by the assistance of God's holy Spirit, and with a disposition of Mind free from all Malice and Prejudice, according to what <hi>Caesar</hi> saith in <hi>Salust,</hi> in the beginning of the Book of <hi>Cataline, Omnes homines qui de Rebus dubiis consultant, ab ira &amp; odio vacuos esse debere, &amp; haud facile animum pervidere verum, ubi illa officiunt.</hi> And St. <hi>Austin</hi> upon the Book against the Letter of the <hi>Manichean,</hi> by them called the Letter of Foundation; <hi>Ut autem facilius mitescatis, &amp;c. nemo nostrum se jam quaeramus quasi ab utrisque nesciatur, ita enim diligenter &amp; concorditer quaeri poterit, si nulla temeraria prasumptions inventa &amp; cognita esse credatur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But not to over-burthen this small Treatise with too great a number of Arguments or Citations, we will chiefly examine two things; First, <hi>Who those Catholick Doctors are, that believed the Doctrine of</hi> Transubstantiation <hi>not to be ancient.</hi> Secondly, <hi>If what those Doctors have writ be true: And whether we can indeed produce sufficient Authorities to believe that the ancient Church did not hold nor believe it.</hi>

               <p>AS for the <hi>Second Point,</hi> which is to see if there is effectively to be found in the Writings of the Ancients, sufficient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities <note place="margin">That the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients indeed did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Before I alledge their Authorities, two Reflections may be made.</p>
               <p>First, that our own Authors do observe, that <hi>Transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi>

                  <hi>Ockam</hi> saith of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> that it cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by natural Reason, nor by Authority of the Bible, but only by the Authority of the Ancients.</p>

               <p>The second Reflection, is that <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">

                  </note> a great many Difficulties quite contrary to natural Reason, none of the Jews nor Pagan Philosophers, disputing against the ancient Christians, ever dream'd of making any objections against it in their Disputations. <hi>Trypho</hi> the Jew charges us with things monstrous, incredible, and strangely invented; as what we teach of <hi>Jesus Christ's being before Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>he took on him our Nature,</hi> that <hi>he was horn of a Virgin,</hi> that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66013:8"/>
                  <hi>God should be born, be made Man;</hi> that <hi>we should adore a Man,</hi> that <hi>we should put our trust in him,</hi> and <hi>that we should invoke another God besides the Creator,</hi> all this appears in S. <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> in his <hi>Dialogue</hi> against <hi>Trypho.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Pagans</hi> reproach us for saying <hi>God</hi> has a <hi>Son,</hi> that this <hi>Son should appear in humane shape,</hi> and they stile it <hi>the Follies of the Christian Discipline;</hi> that <hi>God should be born,</hi> and that he should <hi>be born of a Virgin,</hi> and be <hi>a God of flesh, crucised and buried;</hi> The last <hi>Judgment,</hi> the <hi>pains of eternal Fire,</hi> the <hi>Joys of Heaven,</hi> the <hi>Resurrection of the Dead.</hi> All this appears by <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria Stromat.</hi> l. 6. by <hi>Tertullian</hi> his <hi>Apologet.</hi> ch. 21. 47. in his <hi>Treatise</hi> of the <hi>Flesh of Christ,</hi> ch. 4. and 5.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66013:8"/>
                  <hi>Phineas,</hi> that thrust his Javelin through the Body of an <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite</hi> that committed <hi>Folly</hi> with a <hi>Midianitish Woman,</hi> which turn'd away <hi>God's</hi> Anger from the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him from consuming them. <hi>Let us suppose,</hi> saith he, <hi>that there had been to the Number of one Thousand that had attempted to have transgressed the Law of God, ought six hundred Thousand to have been destroy'd for the sake of one Thousand; it seems to me to have been much juster to have saved one ill Man with so many good ones, than to involve so much good Men in the ruine of one bad one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There's scarce any of our <hi>Mysteries</hi> that have not been cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd by the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Pagans;</hi> yet 'tis very strange that not one should accuse us of admitting in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> accidents with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>substance,</hi> whiteness without any thing that's <hi>white, roundness</hi> without any thing <hi>round; weight</hi> without any thing that's <hi>weighty;</hi> a <hi>corruption</hi> whereunto the <hi>species</hi> are subject, without any thing that's capable of being <hi>corrupted;</hi> a <hi>Nourishment</hi> in the <hi>Symbols,</hi> without any thing that can <hi>nourish;</hi> a power in the <hi>Wine</hi> to be smelt without any thing that may be smelled. No body ever reproach'd us with so strange a thing, that a Man with one word should destroy a substance which he holdeth in his hands, and that never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless against the testimony of all the Senses, I <hi>see</hi> that which is <hi>no more;</hi> I <hi>feel</hi> that which I do <hi>not feel,</hi> I <hi>taste</hi> that which I do <hi>not taste,</hi> I <hi>understand</hi> that which I do <hi>not understand;</hi> I <hi>touch</hi> that which I do <hi>not touch,</hi> that I should be <hi>nourished</hi> with <hi>nothing;</hi> that my <hi>taste</hi> should be delighted with <hi>nothing;</hi> that my <hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>Ears</hi> should de struck with <hi>Nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The three Reflections we have hitherto made, That many of the <note place="margin">Hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> was not antient.</note> antient Catholick Doctors have not believed <hi>Transubstantiation to</hi> be antient; That they have Judged it could not evidently be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the <hi>Holy Scriptures;</hi> and, That the antient Pagan <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> have not reproached us with it, are three very strong Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions to make us mightily doubt the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of this <hi>Doctrine.</hi> But to shew evidently that 'twas but in the <hi>last Ages</hi> that this opinion was made an <hi>Article of Faith,</hi> we need only consult the Doctors of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> and see if they have effectively explain'd the <hi>Eucharist</hi> by the <hi>Systeme of Transubstantiation.</hi>

                  <p>S. <hi>Iustin Martyr saith,</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>That after the common Prayers were ended, there was presented to the chief of the Brethren, which was God's Minister, the</hi> Bread <hi>and the</hi> Wine, <hi>mixt with</hi> Water, <hi>which he receiv'd into his hands, and giving thanks and glory to the Father of Heaven and Earth, through Iesus Christ his Son, and the Holy Ghost, &amp;c. and the said</hi> President <hi>or</hi> Minister <hi>having ended his thanksgiving, the People ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all said</hi> Amen, <hi>those whom we call</hi> Deacons <hi>and</hi> Ministers, <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on this Holy Service, give to every one present at the Holy Communion, part of this Holy Bread, so blessed and glorify'd; and also of the Holy liquor mixt of Wine and Water, upon which Prayers had been made.</hi>
                     </q> And a little lower,<q> 
                        <hi>Behold, Lord, we do not receive this</hi> Bread <hi>nor this</hi> Wine <hi>as common</hi> Bread <hi>and</hi> Wine, <hi>but as Iesus Christ is become</hi> Flesh <hi>and</hi> Blood <hi>by the Word, so also the nourishment which by the Word is become a</hi> Sacrament, <hi>and of which by</hi> conversion and change, our flesh and Blood are nourish'd, <hi>is as we have learned, the</hi> Flesh and Blood <hi>of Iesus Christ incarnate.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If St. <hi>Iustin</hi> had believed that the substance of the <hi>Bread, Wine,</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> had been <hi>changed</hi> after Consecration, so that they had been destroy'd, how could he have said, that after Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Deacons did distribute to the People the <hi>Bread,</hi> the <hi>Wine,</hi> and the <hi>Water?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, When he saith, we do not take this <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> as <hi>common Bread and Wine:</hi> this language amongst the antient Doctors intimates, that both the one and the other do still subsist, but that by Consecration, they have acquir'd a new use and quality. As when <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> Catech. 3. <hi>Ad Illum.</hi> saith, <hi>Approach not to Baptism as to common Water.</hi> Or as <hi>Gregory Nyssen</hi> saith of Baptism, <hi>Do not despise the Holy Font, and look not upon it as common Water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude, this blessed Martyr saith, Our <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood are nourish'd by the change of the Eucharistical food, which converts</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:66013:9"/>
                     <hi>and turns it self into our Flesh and Blood.</hi> These words plainly shew, that 'tis the Bread and Wine which are turn'd into our <hi>Substance,</hi> into our <hi>Flesh,</hi> and into our <hi>Blood,</hi> seeing that 'tis certain, that the <hi>real Flesh and Blood</hi> of Jesus Christ, is not converted into our <note place="margin">Iustin Martyr.</note> 
                     <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood.</hi> So when <hi>Iustin</hi> saith, That the Sacramental Food is the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Jesus Christ, that imports, that 'tis not common <hi>Bread and Wine,</hi> but a <hi>Bread</hi> and Wine which is to be consider'd as the <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood of</hi> the <hi>Word incarnate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> proves against <hi>Valentine</hi> and his followers, that our Bodies shall not be destroy'd, and by consequence that they shall <note place="margin">Irenaeus</note> be raised incorruptible by receiving the Sacrament, as the <hi>Bread</hi> of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> becomes supernatural by the invocation of the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We establish in the Eucharist,</hi> saith S. Irenaeus, <hi>the Communion</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Adversus He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 24.</note> 
                     <hi>and unity of the Flesh and of the Spirit; for as the Bread which is of the Earth, receiving the invocation of God, is no longer common Bread, but is the Sacrament compos'd of two things, one Terrestrial, and the other Celestial: So also our Bodies which receive the Eucharist, are no longer corruptible, but have the Hope of a future Resurrection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This passage doth suppose, that the <hi>Bread</hi> remains in the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist;</hi> in the first place, because if Consecration did destroy the <hi>substance</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> it must be confess'd the Holy Doctor had taken wrong measures, to shew that the Flesh is not destroy'd by the grace of the Holy Spirit, by the Bread of the Eucharist, which it self should be destroy'd by the grace of the Spirit which comes upon it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Because a little before, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> saith, <hi>How is it they say, the Flesh shall be destroy'd and turn to corruption, seeing it is nourish'd with the body and blood of Christ?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Flesh</hi> is fed by the conversion of nourishment into the body, which not being to be said of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> is only to be apply'd to the <hi>Bread.</hi> Moreover these words, That <hi>the Eucharist is compos'd of two things,</hi> sufficiently shew, that the <hi>Bread</hi> remains; for to say <hi>Irenaeus</hi> means by a <hi>Terrestrial thing,</hi> the <hi>accidents</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> &amp; <hi>Wine,</hi> besides that S. <hi>Austin</hi> saith in the second Book of <hi>Soliloquies,</hi> Chap. 12. that 'tis a thing monstrous to say that accidents subfist without a subject; <hi>Irenaeus</hi> also himself saith, Book 2. cap. 14. that Water cannot be without moisture, Fire without heat, a Stone without hardness. For these things are so united, that the one cannot be separated from the other, but the one must subsist in the other. So in like manner, by this <hi>Terrestrial thing</hi> must be
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66013:10"/>
understood the <hi>Bread,</hi> as S. <hi>Gregory Naz.</hi> saith in his fourth Oration according to <hi>Bilius</hi> his version, <hi>Baptism also is compos'd of two things, Water and the Spirit; the one is visible and is meant in a corporal manner, but the other is invisible and operates after a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Irenaeus</note> 
                     <hi>manner; the one is Typical, the other cleanseth that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and most hidden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> saith the same in different terms. <q>

                           <hi>Clem. Alexand. P. edag. l.</hi> 2.</note> Blood <hi>of Christ is twofold, the one is</hi> carnal, <hi>whereby we are deliver'd from corruption, the other is</hi> spiritual, <hi>whereby we are anointed, and that is to</hi> drink <hi>the</hi> Blood of <hi>Iesus Christ, to be partakers of the incorruption of the Lord. Now the virtue of the Word is the Holy Spirit, as the Blood is the vertue of the Flesh. By Analogy then, the Wine, mixt with Water, as the Spirit with Man; and this mixture makes the Wine the pleasanter to drink, but the Spirit leadeth to incorruption. Now this mixture of the one with the other, to wit, of the Wine and the Word, is called</hi> Eucharist, <hi>which is highly esteem'd, whereby those who worthily partake of it by Faith, are sanctify'd both in their Body and Soul.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> said that the <hi>Eucharist</hi> is a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">Graece <gap reason="foreign">

For a mixture is at least of two things. So the Fathers have called <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> a mixture of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man. The Body of Man,</hi> saith S. Austin, <hi>is a mixture of Body and Soul; the Person of</hi>

                     <hi>Christ is a mixture of God and Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Epitome of <hi>Theodotus</hi> saith, <hi>The Bread and Oyl are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>

                     <hi>by the virtue of the name, and they remain not what they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though to look on them they seem to be the same, but by virtue, they are are changed into a Spiritual force. So water sanctified is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Baptism, it not only retains what's less, but also acquires a sanctification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The author saith, The <hi>Bread</hi> is <hi>changed,</hi> but when he adds that 'tis into a <hi>Spiritual virtue,</hi> he quite excludes the change of its <hi>substance;</hi> for by <hi>virtue,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual,</hi> cannot be understood any other change but that of <hi>virtue</hi> and <hi>quality,</hi> seeing this Author speaks of this change, as being common to the Water of Baptism, to the Oyl of Unction, and to the Bread of the Eucharist.</p>

                     <hi>TErtullian</hi> in his first Book against <hi>Marcion,</hi> shewing that <note place="margin">Tertullian.</note> Jesus Christ is not contrary to the Creator, as this Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick affirm'd, saith in his 14th. Chap. <hi>Hitherto Jesus Christ has not condemn'd the Water wherewith he cleanseth his Children, nor the Oyl wherewith he anoints them, nor the Hony nor the Milk where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he makes them his Children, nor the Bread by which he represents his body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this passage, the <hi>Bread represents the Body of Jesus Christ,</hi> therefore the <hi>Bread</hi> remains in the Sacrament, and this <hi>Bread</hi> is not <hi>really</hi> Jesus Christ, because what doth <hi>represent,</hi> is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing than what is <hi>represented.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Two things have been said on this place of <hi>Tertullian;</hi> first, that the <hi>Bread</hi> signifies the <hi>accidents of Bread;</hi> the second that the Word <hi>represent,</hi> does signify in this place, <hi>to make present:</hi> As when in a Court of Justice a Prisoner is made appear as often as he is demanded.</p>
                  <p>Against the former, there's no reason to believe that <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaking of <hi>Water,</hi> of <hi>Oyl,</hi> of <hi>Hony,</hi> and <hi>Milk,</hi> should intend to speak of their <hi>accidents,</hi> but of their very <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> and that speaking of <hi>Bread,</hi> he should speak only of its <hi>accidents.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Against the second it's most certain that in matter of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, the term to <hi>signify</hi> is taken literally, to <hi>signify.</hi> S. <hi>Austin</hi> saith, Ep. 5. <hi>the signs, when applyed to Holy things, are called Sacraments. Tertullian</hi> explains himself clearly Lib. 3. against <hi>Marcion,</hi> so that there's no cause of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when he saith, <hi>That Jesus Christ has given to the Bread the priviledge of being the figure of his Body.</hi> The same <hi>Tertullian</hi> lib. 4. <hi>contra Marcion.</hi> cap. 40. doth prove that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> had a <hi>real Body,</hi> and not one in <hi>shew</hi> only, as <hi>Marcion</hi> dream'd, and he proves it by this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: That which hath a <hi>figure</hi> ought to be <hi>real</hi> and <hi>true;</hi>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:66013:11"/>
now Jesus Christ hath in the Eucharist a <hi>figure of his Body,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Body</hi> of Jesus Christ is <hi>real</hi> and <hi>true,</hi> and not a <hi>Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> saith <hi>Tertullian, having taken the Bread which</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Tertullian.</note> 
                     <hi>he distributed amongst his Disciples, he made it his Body, saying, This is the figure of my Body: now it had been no figure, if Jesus Christ had not had a real and true Body; for an empty thing as a Phantasm is, is not capable of having any figure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From hence 'tis concluded, that the <hi>Bread</hi> being the <hi>figure of the Body of Jesus Christ,</hi> and that which is a <hi>figure,</hi> being distinguished from the thing <hi>signified,</hi> the <hi>Bread</hi> of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> is not <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>truely</hi> the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and so the <hi>Bread</hi> is not destroy'd, but remains to be the <hi>figure</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it be said, the <hi>Bread</hi> is destroy'd, and that the <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> are the <hi>figure</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> this gives up the victory to <hi>Marcion,</hi> to prove, that Jesus Christ had a <hi>true Body,</hi> and not one in <hi>shew only,</hi> because Jesus Christ hath in the <hi>Eucharist</hi> the <hi>figure</hi> of <hi>Bread,</hi> which is <hi>Bread</hi> only in appearance. <hi>Marcion</hi> might have retorted the argument and said, according to you, <hi>Tertullian,</hi> the Sacrament is the <hi>figure</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> of Jesus Christ; now as this <hi>figure</hi> is <hi>Bread</hi> in <hi>appearance,</hi> and is called <hi>Bread</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because of the outward <hi>accidents</hi> and <hi>qualities</hi> which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, so also the <hi>Body</hi> of Jesus Christ was only a <hi>Body</hi> in <hi>appearance,</hi> and was called a <hi>Body</hi> because it had the outward <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents</hi> and <hi>qualities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith, That Jesus Christ distributed to his Disciples the <hi>Bread</hi> which he had taken to make it the <hi>figure of his Body;</hi> it is most certain he took true <hi>Bread,</hi> and by consequence, that he distributed <hi>true Bread.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The same <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his <hi>Treatise of the Soul,</hi> disputing against the <hi>Accademitians</hi> that questioned the truth of the testimony of the <hi>Senses,</hi> saith to them, that we must not at all doubt of the testimony of the Senses, lest occasion might farther be taken to doubt the actions of the humanity of Jesus Christ, that it might not be said, That it was untrue that he saw <hi>Satan</hi> fall from Heaven; That it was not true, that he heard the Father's voice from heaven bearing witness to his Son;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66013:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
That he was deceived when he touched <hi>Peter</hi>'s Wifes Mother; That he was deceived when he smelt the sweet odour which he was pleas'd to accept for the preparation to his Death; or, That he tasted the Wine that he consecrated in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance <note place="margin">Tertullian.</note> of his Blood.</p>
                  <p>It is evident that to consecrate <hi>Wine</hi> in remembrance of <hi>Blood,</hi> cannot be understood of a <hi>substance</hi> which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd all saving the <hi>accidents;</hi> This manner of expression in the language of the Ancients signifying no more, but that a substance remains always in its first state, only at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to a higher degree, which is, to be the Sacrament of a Heavenly and supernatural thing. To conclude, if <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> had believed that the Wine had been destroy'd, and that nothing but the appearance was left, against the testimony of all the Senses, had it not been an unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable fault in <hi>Tertullian,</hi> to prove that the Senses could not be deceived by the Example of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> where the Senses are quite deceived?</p>

If all that enters into the Mouth goes into the Belly, and there is cast out into the draught, this food which is sanctifyed by the word of God, and by Prayer, goes also into the Belly and is cast out into the draught, according to its material substance; But according to the Prayer which has been thereunto added, it becomes profitable according to the measure of Faith, by causing the mind to become inlightned, having regard to what is profitable; And 'tis not the matter of Bread, but the words which have been pronounc'd upon it, that avails him which eateth in such a manner as is not unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Lord, and this may be said of the Body Typical, or Symbolical; Many things might be said also of the Word made</hi>

The same <hi>Origen</hi> in the Seventh Homily on <hi>Leviticus,</hi> saith, That <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> before his Passion, drank Wine, but being ready to suffer, he refused to drink it; <hi>Ubi vero tempus advenit Crucis suae, accipiens, inquit, Galicem benedixit, &amp; dedit Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulis</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Origen.</note> 
                     <hi>suis, dicens, Accipite &amp; Bibite ex hoc. Vos, inquit, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite quia non accessuri estis and altare, ipse autem tanquam accessurus ad altare dicit, Amen, dico vobis quia non bibam de generatione vitis hujus, usque quò bibam illud novum vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biscum in Regno Patris mei. Origen</hi> affirms, That our Saviour in celebrating the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> did not drink Wine, because he was ready to approach the Altar (of his Passion) and that the Apostles did drink Wine, because they were not yet ready to approach to the Altar of Martyrdom. And that in this sense, the Figure of the Old Testament was accomplished, where 'twas forbidden to <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Priests to drink Wine when they were about to approach to the Altar. All this Discourse is false, if Jesus Christ spake not these words of <hi>true Wine, I will not drink,</hi> &amp;c. and if what the Apostles drank was not <hi>true Wine.</hi>

                     <hi>Lord recommends to us Unity: for when Jesus Christ called his Body, the Bread which is made of several Grains, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended the Unity of Christian People; and when he called his Blood, the Wine, made of several Grains and Grapes, he represented one Flock united by the Band of Charity.</hi> Now these words, where Jesus Christ called the <hi>Bread</hi> his <hi>Body,</hi> and the <hi>Wine</hi> his <hi>Blood,</hi> is as if he had said of the <hi>Bread, This is my Body,</hi> and <hi>of</hi> the <hi>Wine, This is my Blood.</hi> And if hereunto we add the words of the Jesuite <hi>Salmeron,</hi> who said, <hi>If</hi>

                     <hi>Jesus Christ had said, This Bread is my Body, and this Wine is my Blood, it would have obliged us to have understood these words in a figurative sense, because the Bread cannot be a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Body, nor the Wine Blood, but in a figurative Sense.

Therefore assuring them that they should see him after his Resurrection, and that he would stay with them, and that they might bear witness of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, might see and behold him, tells them, I will no more drink the Fruit of the Vine, until I drink it with you in a new manner, whereof you shall bear testimony, for you shall see me after my Resurrection; But wherefore,</hi> continues S.

                  <p>The same <hi>Father</hi> in his Commentary upon the Epistle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> Chap. 5. explaining these words of the Apostle, <hi>The Flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the Flesh;</hi> The <hi>Manicheans</hi> understood by the <hi>Flesh,</hi> the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Body,</hi> and by the <hi>Spirit</hi> they understood the <hi>Soul;</hi> and they said, That the Apostle cut Man into two, and intimated, that Man was compos'd of two contrary Substances, one bad, which was the Flesh; and the other good, which was the Spirit, which proceeded from the good God, and the Body from the bad God—S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom</hi> answers, That the Apostle in this place doth not call the Flesh the Body, <hi>Apostolum non hic carnem appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare Corpus,</hi> as the <hi>Manicheans</hi> supposed, and saith, That the Apostle do's not always mean by the <hi>Flesh,</hi> the <hi>nature of the Body, Naturam Corporis,</hi> but that very often by the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66013:17"/>
                     <hi>Flesh,</hi> he means something else, as <hi>evil Desires;</hi> and having proved this by sundry passages of the Apostle, and other holy Writers, he proves it at last by the example of the <hi>Iucharist,</hi> and of the Church, which, he saith, is <note place="margin">Chrysostom.</note> called Body in the Holy Scriptures; he saith farther, That the Scripture is wont to call by the name of <hi>Flesh,</hi> as well the <hi>Church,</hi> as the <hi>Mysteries,</hi> saving, It is his Body, <hi>Rursum Carnis vocabulo Scriptura solet appellare tum Mysteria, tum totam Ecclesiam, dicens eam Christi Corpus esse.</hi> It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by these words of St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s, That he did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Consecrated <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> were the same with the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> seeing he proves by the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> that the <hi>Consecraeted Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> are called <hi>Flesh;</hi> and that the Word <hi>Flesh</hi> in this place, is taken for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else besides <hi>Body,</hi> and that he puts the Term <hi>Flesh,</hi> given to the <hi>Consecrated Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> which are the <hi>Mysteries,</hi> in the rank of other Terms of Flesh given to <hi>evil Desires,</hi> and to the <hi>Church,</hi> which are <hi>mystical</hi> and <hi>figurative</hi> Terms.

                  <p>The same St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> wrote a Letter to <hi>Caesarius,</hi> which indeed is not inserted in his Works, but is sound in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript in the Library at <hi>Florence,</hi> and it was also found in <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Archbishop Cranmer</hi>'s Library, it is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in the <hi>Bibliotheca Patrum,</hi> Printed at <hi>Collen,</hi> 1618. in this <hi>Bibliotheque,</hi> Tom. 4. there is found the Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of an ancient nameless Author, who wrote against the <hi>Severian,</hi> and <hi>Acephalian</hi> Hereticks, wherein is recited a Passage taken out of this Letter.

one Lord, both Natures united making but one, the same Power, the same Dominion; although they be two different Natures, each conserves its own Nature, because they are two, and yet without confusion; for as the Bread before it is sanctified, is called Bread, when by the intercession of the Priest, Divine <note place="margin">Chrysostom.</note> Grace has sanctified it, it loses the name of Bread, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes worthy to be called the Body of Jesus Christ, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Nature of Bread abides in it, so that they are not two Bodies, but one sole Body of the Son; so the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature being united to the Humane Nature of Jesus Christ, it did not make two Persons, but one only Person and one Son.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> saith plainly, That the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth after <hi>Consecration;</hi> and this Father's Argument would be of no validity, if this <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but in shew, for <hi>Apollinarius</hi> might have made ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opposite Argument, and say, That indeed it might be said there were two <hi>Natures</hi> in Jesus Christ, but that the Humane <hi>Nature</hi> was only in appearance, as the <hi>Bread</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist</hi> is but in <hi>shew,</hi> and hath only outward and visible qualities remaining in it, whereby it is term'd to be <hi>Bread.</hi>

                  <p>The same S. <hi>Jerom</hi> in his Commentary upon the 26 Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> saith, <hi>Jesus Christ having eaten the Paschal Lamb, took Bread which strengthens the Heart of Man, and proceeded to the accomplishment of the Sacrament of the true Passover, that as Melchisedeck had offered Bread and Wine in Figure, he also him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self would represent the truth of his Body.</hi>

                  <p>In the same sense he saith; That Jesus Christ although in Heaven, yet the <hi>Bread</hi> is the <hi>Body,</hi> and the <hi>Wine</hi> the <hi>Blood,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are the <hi>Sacraments</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>He saith, What one sees hath a <hi>bodily species;</hi> now in this Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, by <hi>bodily species,</hi> he means the <hi>very Substance,</hi> and not the <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents.</hi> For he saith afterwards, speaking of <hi>Bread</hi> in general, as <hi>Bread</hi> to be a visible <hi>species of Bread,</hi> must be made of several Grains reduced into one lump; now by the <hi>species of Bread,</hi> it is plain, St. <hi>Austin</hi> there means <hi>true Bread,</hi> and a <hi>true Substance.</hi>

                  <p>He saith, What you <hi>see,</hi> is <hi>Bread,</hi> and a <hi>Cup;</hi> now by <hi>Cup,</hi> he doth not mean the <hi>appearance of a Cup,</hi> he means a <hi>true Cup.</hi> He saith this <hi>Bread</hi> is the <hi>Mystery</hi> of the Lord.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66013:19"/>
                     <hi>Bread</hi> is the <hi>Mystery of Believers. Mysterium vestrum in Mensa Domini accipitis.</hi> That is to say, That the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> are the <hi>Figure</hi> of Jesus Christ, as they are the <hi>Mystical Body</hi> of Jesus Christ. To conclude, St. <hi>Austin</hi> saith, The Faith of the <note place="margin">St. <hi>Austin.</hi>
                     </note> New-baptized was to be strengthened; it was therefore here the proper place for him to have said, That the <hi>Bread</hi> was no more <hi>Bread,</hi> that the <hi>Wine</hi> was no longer <hi>Wine,</hi> but that there remained only the <hi>Accidents</hi> of the one and the other.</p>
                  <p>The same Holy Father answering Bishop <hi>Boniface,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to know how it might be said of an Infant newly Baptis'd, <note place="margin">Ep. 23. ad Bonif.</note> he hath <hi>Faith,</hi> he <hi>Believes,</hi> who is incapable of believing, and of whom no assurance can be given what he will be afterwards; he saith, <hi>That as every Sunday, and Easter Day, is called Easter, and the Resurrection, although the Lords Easter, and Resurrection, are things happened several Ages past; so it may be said, An Infant hath Faith, because he hath the Sacrament of Faith. For, saith he, if the Sacraments had not some resemblance with the things whereof they are Sacraments, they would be no Sacraments; as therefore in some sort the Sacrament of the Body of Jesus Christ is the Body of Jesus Christ, and the Sacrament of his Blood, is the Blood of Christ, so also the Sacrament of Faith, is Faith; now to believe, is nothing else but to have Faith.</hi>

                  <p>He saith, The <hi>Eucharist</hi> is called <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> because it is both the one and the other in some sort: now according to St. <hi>Gregory Nyssen, What is not truly that by the name by which it</hi>

sense; and that so much the rather, because this manner of speech, <hi>Jesus Christ made no difficulty,</hi> plainly shews, that Jesus Christ did not speak in a <hi>proper</hi> but in a <hi>figurative sense,</hi> as <hi>Fulgentius</hi> saith, <hi>Although the Apostle saith, That Jesus</hi>

                  <p>The same holy <hi>Doctor</hi> saith in several places after the Apostle, That the <hi>Bread</hi> in the Sacrament after Consecration, is <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> and <hi>distributed;</hi> and he doth very well recommend this breaking the Bread, as being a great mystery.

                     <hi>breaking was the Sacrament whereby Jesus Christ brings us all to the knowledge of his Person.</hi> A little before he saith; <hi>By the</hi> Prayers, <hi>we mean those which are said before one begins to bless what is upon the Lords Table. The Prayers</hi> are said when that which is on the Lords Table is blessed, sanctifyed, and distributed. In his Epistle to <hi>Casulanus</hi> he saith of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that in the night time he went <hi>to break Bread,</hi> as it is broken <note place="margin">

We are then secure; we break Bread, and we know the Lord.</hi> If then after consecration we <hi>break Bread</hi> to distribute, then of necessity the <hi>Bread</hi> must remain: for to say that 'tis the <hi>accidents</hi> which are <hi>broken,</hi> and <hi>distributed,</hi> S. <hi>Austin</hi> doth say the contrary, when he affirms, that one <hi>breaks</hi> and <hi>distributes</hi> what is on the Table, being <hi>blessed</hi> and <hi>sanctify'd.</hi> Now to <hi>bless</hi> and <hi>sanctify,</hi> one shall never find to have signifi'd to <hi>destroy,</hi> and <hi>change the substance.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The same Father in his 52 Sermon, <hi>de verbis Domini,</hi> saith, <hi>almost all do call the Sacrament the Body of Jesus Christ.</hi> Now if the <hi>Bread</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Penè quidem Sacramentum omnes corpus ejus dicunt.</note> were the <hi>real Body</hi> of Jesus Christ, wherefore should S. <hi>Anstin</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that all called it the <hi>Body</hi> of Jesus Christ? For one cannot make such a remark, but when one saith of a thing, that 'tis that which properly it is not. It would be ridiculous to say, almost all call <hi>Lewis</hi> 14 King; &amp; the reason is, because 'tis not strange that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons should be called by their names: but on the contrary, it is very strange, to call one by a name that doth not at all belong to him.</p>
                  <p>The same <hi>Father</hi> in his 26. Treatise upon S. <hi>John,</hi> going to shew upon these words of the Apostle, <hi>They did all eat the same Spiritual meat, and drink the same Spiritual drink: The</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and difference there is betwixt the Sacraments of the old and new Testament, saith, <hi>The Fathers did eat the same spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual food as we do, not the same corporal food as we do; because they did eat Manna, and as for us, we eat something else; They drank the same spiritual drink we do, the same as to the significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but different as to visible and outward kind.</hi> And upon S. <hi>John,</hi> Treatise 45. <hi>If you consider the visible species, it was another drink, if you consider what was signify'd by their drink, and ours, it was one and the same thing. Si speciem visibilem intendas aliud est, si intelligibilem significationem, cundem potum spiritualem biberunt.</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:66013:21"/>
And upon the 77. Psalm, <hi>Their food was the very same with ours, the same as to what it signify'd, but different in kind. Idem in mysterio cibus illorum qui noster; Sed significatione idem, non specie.</hi> This reasoning does intimate, That the Fathers under the old <note place="margin">St. <hi>Austin.</hi>
                     </note> Testament did, and we now do eat a corporal food, and that we drink a corporal liquor. Now by this corporal meat and drink, we must understand either the <hi>accidents</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> or the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Jesus Christ, or the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine it self.</hi> It cannot be spoken of the first, because the <hi>accidents</hi> of Bread and Wine are only <hi>qualities,</hi> or <hi>dimensions;</hi> now <hi>qualities</hi> and <hi>dimensions</hi> are not <hi>corporal.</hi> The <hi>quality</hi> is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is <hi>incorporeal,</hi> saith <hi>Nemesius,</hi> of the Soul; as concerning <hi>dimensions,</hi> S. <hi>Austin de genesi ad literam,</hi> saith, <hi>We call that a Body which taketh up some space by its length, by its breadth, and by its depth. Nemesius</hi> gives the reason of it, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,</hi> saith he, <hi>nothing that is immaterial is a Body, for all Bodies are material.</hi> There being nothing material then in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist, as is suppos'd, there being nothing that takes up place, that is large or long, or deep; There is nothing corporeal in the Sacrament, and by consequence, nothing that can be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med corporal meat or drink. Moreover, when Jesus Christ speaks of corporal nourishment and drink in the Eucharist, as the Fathers under the old Testament had done, he speaks of bodily meat and drink, S. <hi>Austin</hi> did not understand the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral meat and drink spoke of by the Fathers of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be only the <hi>accidents</hi> of one and the other, so that S. <hi>Austin</hi> speaking in the same terms of bodily meat and drink, in relation to that of the Antients, he did not mean meer acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents or qualities. The <hi>Body of Jesus Christ</hi> nor his <hi>Hood,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be this corporal nourishment which S. <hi>Austin</hi> compares to that of the Fathers under the Law: for by bodily meat and drink which he saith we receive in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> he means a visible subject, <hi>aliud illi, aliud nos, sed specie visibili, si speciem visibilem inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, aliud est.</hi> It remains then that in S. <hi>Austin</hi>'s sense, we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand by the <hi>corporal nature</hi> of the Eucharist the <hi>visible Bread,</hi> the <hi>visible Wine,</hi> and not their <hi>qualities</hi> and <hi>accidents.</hi>

                  <p>The same Father in the third Book of the Trin. cap. 10. speaking of things that are taken to signify, saith, <hi>a thing is taken to signify, either after such a manner, as that the thing should subsist and remain some time, as did the Brazen Serpent, lift up in</hi>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>passeth away and is consumed in receiving the Sacrament.</hi> S. <hi>Austin</hi> there saith, That the Bread of the Sacrament which is taken to signify, passeth and is consumed in receiving the Sacrament; Now if the Bread be destroyed and Transubstantiated by these words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> then it passeth not away, and is not consumed in the act of receiving.</p>
                  <p>The same Doctor in the seventeenth <hi>Of the City of God</hi> saith, <hi>To eat Bread, is in the New Testament the sacrifice of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;</hi> and against the Enemy of the Law. l. 7. c. 20. <hi>Those,</hi> saith he, <hi>which read know what Melchisedeck offered where he blessed Abraham, and those which are partakers, see that the like sacrifice is now offer'd through all the World.</hi> How is it that the Sacrifice of Christians, is to <hi>eat Bread,</hi> if the <hi>Bread</hi> do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main? How is it that communicating, one is partaker of what <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> offer'd, if in communicating, one do not receive neither <hi>Bread,</hi> nor <hi>Wine?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The same Father in the third Book against <hi>Parmenian,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the <hi>Donatists</hi> for forsaking the Church, tells them, S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and the other Bishops, did not separate themselves because they would not communicate with covetous persons, and Usurers; <hi>but that on the contrary, they did eat with them the Bread of the Lord, and drank his Cup.</hi> This passage sheweth, that when S. <hi>Austin</hi> said to the new Baptised, as hath been shewn, that the <hi>Bread</hi> is the <hi>Body</hi> of Jesus Christ, it could not be understood but <hi>figuratively:</hi> for here the <hi>Bread</hi> is said to be of the <hi>Lord;</hi> now saith S. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> that which is another's is not that other himself, to whom it belongs. <hi>Id quod ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cujus est, non idipsum est cujus est.</hi> And S. <hi>Austin</hi> elsewhere distinguisheth betwixt the <hi>Bread</hi> which belongs to the Lord, and the <hi>Bread</hi> which is the Lord. Speaking of <hi>Judas</hi> and the <note place="margin">

                        <hi>advantage to have been present at that Supper that he gave with his own hands to his Disciples, without Faith; Faith afterwards was of greater advantage than treachery was then; St.</hi> Paul <hi>who believed, was not there present, and</hi> Judas <hi>who betray'd his Master, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. How many be there now that come to the Communion, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho they did not see that Table, and tho they never saw with their Eyes, nor tasted with their Palate, the Bread which the Lord held in his hands, nevertheless, because the same Supper is still prepared, do there eat and drink their own Damnation?</hi>
                     </q> It plainly appears, That the <hi>Bread</hi> which St. <hi>Austin</hi> saith our Saviour had in his hands during the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> was <hi>true Bread,</hi> because St. <hi>Austin</hi> saith, That those who at present participate of the Sacrament, do not <hi>Tast,</hi> nor <hi>Eat</hi> the <hi>Bread</hi> which our Saviour held in his hands, and which he distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, and of which the Disciples did formerly eat.</p>
                  <p>The same Father teaching that the Good might participate of the Divine Sacraments with the Wicked, saith, Judas <hi>and</hi> Peter <hi>had</hi>

What is this <hi>Bread,</hi> whereof one receives one Portion, and another, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Part? Are they <hi>Accidents?</hi> But <hi>Accidents</hi> are neither <hi>Bread</hi> nor <hi>Food.</hi> It is not the <hi>real Body</hi> of Jesus Christ, for it cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by Parcels; it must then be <hi>true Bread</hi> which remains after Consecration, and which is, as is said before, <hi>Blessed, Sanctified,</hi> and <hi>Broke</hi> in Pieces on the Holy Table to be distributed. <hi>Benedicitur &amp; Sanctificatur, &amp; ad distribuendum comminuitur.</hi>

It is what St. <hi>Austin</hi> intends, when he saith, <hi>Nec quando manduca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> (when we eat Jesus Christ) <hi>de illo partes facimus; equidem in Sacramento sic fit.</hi> We do not make Morsels, but it is done in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, that is to say, That we break and divide the <hi>Sign</hi> and the <hi>Bread,</hi> which is the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>The same Father saying that the <hi>Accidents</hi> cannot in any wise subsist without their <hi>Subject,</hi> saith in his <hi>2d</hi> Book of Soliloquies, Chap. 12. <hi>What can reconcile what you demand? Or who can think it possible to be done, that that which is in a Subject should remain, the Subject it self ceasing to be? For 'tis a thing monstrous, and very far from the Truth, that that which doth not subsist, if it be not in a Subject, can be, the Subject it self not remaining.</hi> Also in the <hi>13th</hi> Chap. <hi>19th</hi> Book, and in the Book of the Immortality of the Soul, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>The Subject being changed, of necessity all that was in the Subject must be changed.</hi> In the <hi>8th</hi> Chap. <hi>What is not of it self, if it be abandoned by that by which it is, must undoubtedly cease to be.</hi> Also in the <hi>10th Chap.</hi> and in the Book of <hi>Categories,</hi> speaking of <hi>Accidents, A colour cannot be without a Subject.</hi> And in the Epistle to <hi>Dardanus, Take away the Bodies from the qualities of Bodies, they will have no place to remain in, and by consequence it is necessary that they cannot be.</hi> And against <hi>Julian,</hi> Chap. 5. <hi>It's true,</hi> saith St. <hi>Austin, that the things that are in a Subject as the qualities are, cannot be without the Subject wherein they are, as the colour or form,</hi> &amp;c. It's impossible, had St. <hi>Austin</hi> believed that the <hi>Bread</hi> did not remain in the <hi>Eucharist</hi> after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration, that he should have esteemed that absurd and ridiculous which happened every day. It also seems that St. <hi>Austin</hi> had been too wide, when he doubts in the <hi>146th Ep.</hi> to <hi>Consentius;</hi> Whether Jesus Christ has <hi>Blood,</hi> when he saith on the <hi>98th</hi> Psalm, <hi>You shall</hi>

                  <p>To conclude, St. <hi>Austin</hi> in his <hi>33d</hi> Sermon on <hi>the Words of our Lord,</hi> having said, as hath been seen before, That of things which are put to signify, there are some that are to remain, others to be destroy'd, when the Ministry of their Signification is accomplish'd; as the <hi>Bread</hi> of the Sacrament; he adds, <hi>But because these things are obvious to men, as being practic'd by Men, they may deserve our Veneration, as being Holy and Religious things; but they cannot cause any wonder in us, as if they were miraculous.</hi> Certainly if St. <hi>Austin</hi> had held <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> as it comprehends many things repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to natural Reason, which are so many astonishing Miracles, St. <hi>Austin</hi> could not have said, That the Sacraments, wherein he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> have something in them that deserves our <hi>Respect and Veneration;</hi> but have nothing that deserves our <hi>Astonishment and Admiration.</hi>

                  <p>These are some of the Reasons which made Monsieur <hi>De Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Paris,</hi> Predecessor to him that with so much <note place="margin">
                        <hi>French</hi> Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hum. Treatise of the Euch.</note> Reputation now fills the chiefest. See of <hi>France,</hi> say, That the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Doctors are to blame, when they pretend that St. <hi>Austin</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the Text of the Institution of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> as it is done in the Schools. And a little before; that in St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Divinity, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> should be expounded in this manner, <hi>This Bread is the Sign and Sacrament of my Body:</hi> For according to St. <hi>Austin,</hi> saith Monsieur <hi>De Marca,</hi> The <hi>Bread,</hi> to speak properly, is but the <hi>Sign</hi> and <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> to which Jesus Christ made no scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to give the name of the thing signified. It is also the Judgment of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> when he saith, <hi>When Jesus Christ said, this is my Body, That is to say, this is the Figure of my Body;</hi> and saith Monsieur <hi>De Marca,</hi> The Reasons that are given to the contrary, are not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory.</p>

                     <hi>his Antitype, and is distributed to Believers by the Priest, are not two Bodies.</hi> It appears by this comparison, That <hi>Theodoret</hi> did believe the <hi>Bread</hi> of the Eucharist is something else besides the <hi>Body</hi> of Christ; and by consequence, he believed that there remained <note place="margin">Theodoret.</note>

                     <hi>the Divine Mysteries, should not have any regard to the nature of the things that are seen; but that they should believe by the change of Names, the change that is made by Grace: For having called his</hi> Body, Wheat <hi>and</hi> Bread, <hi>and having called himself a</hi> Vine, <hi>he honours the</hi> visible Symbols <hi>with the name of his</hi> Body <hi>and</hi> Blood, <hi>not in changing their</hi> Nature, <hi>but in adding</hi> Grace <hi>to their</hi> Nature.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:66013:25"/>
                     <hi>true Wine:</hi> and by the <hi>whitness</hi> of the <hi>Mystical food,</hi> he meant the whiteness of the <hi>Bread</hi> which is both food and Image, which cannot be understood of the <hi>true Body</hi> of Jesus Christ, which is neither the <hi>Image</hi> of himself, nor <hi>bodily food;</hi> nor of the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, <note place="margin">Procopius.</note> which cannot nourish the Body, because nourishment pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from matter.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Certainly, if the Sacrament of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> is not <hi>properly</hi> the <hi>Body</hi> of Jesus Christ, as <hi>Facundus</hi> saith, but barely <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> as <hi>Baptism</hi> is <hi>Adoption;</hi> the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> are not <hi>Transubstantiated</hi> into the Eucharist, and are but simple signs, and something that is distinguished from the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Jesus Christ.</p>

                     <hi>which we break, is the Participation of the body of Christ, so also the Bread of Idols, is the Participation of Devils.</hi> Now as the Participation of the Bread of Idols, is no <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> or real change into De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils: so also the Participation of the Bread of the Lord, is not a <hi>real</hi> and <hi>substantial change</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> into the <hi>Body</hi> of the Lord.</p>

                     <hi>ISidore</hi> Bishop of <hi>Sevil, Anno</hi> 600. saith, That by the command of Jesus Christ himself, we do call <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> that which <note place="margin">Isidorus Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spalensis.</note> being the Fruits of the Earth, is sanctified and made a Sacrament by the invisible Operation of the Holy Ghost. In the <hi>1st</hi> Book of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical <note place="margin">Orig. l. 6. c 19.</note> Offices, he saith, <hi>That the Bread is called the Body of Jesus Christ, because it strengthens the Body, and that the Wine is called his Blood, because it increaseth Blood in the Body; and that the Bread and Wine are two visible things, which being sanctified by the Holy Ghost, do go on to be the Sacrament of the Divine Body.</hi> Now a <hi>Sacrament</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a <hi>holy Sign.</hi> It would therefore be a strange kind of way of <hi>Isidore,</hi> if he had believ'd the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> were <hi>transubstantiated,</hi> to say, the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> are two things visible, which being san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the Holy Ghost, do become the Sacraments of the Divine Body. By this Language it might as well be said, That the Fathers believed that the <hi>Water</hi> of Baptism was <hi>transubstantiated</hi> after their Consecration.</p>
                  <p>The same Bishop saith, <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> that offer'd of the Fruits of <note place="margin">In Alleg. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> cap. 26. <hi>These are not any longer Jewish Sacrifices, such as were offer'd by</hi> Aaron <hi>the Priest, which are now offer'd by Believers, but they are such Sacrifices as were presented by</hi> Melchisedeck <hi>King of</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, <hi>that is to say, it is Bread and Wine, the true Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ.</hi> He saith, The <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Jesus Christ is <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> That both the one and the other are such Sacrifices as those offer'd by <hi>Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck;</hi> there is therefore no question, but St. <hi>Isidore</hi> did not believe that the <hi>Bread</hi> was destroy'd in the Sacrament, because he esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishes the Sacrament in the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> such as <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> had offer'd.</p>

                     <hi>Beda,</hi> an English Priest, saith, <hi>That Jesus Christ having ended the Ceremony of the Ancient Passover, which was celebrated in Commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bondage in</hi> Egypt, <hi>out of which the</hi> Jews <hi>had been deliver'd, proceeded to the new Passover, which the Church celebrates in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>In the same place he adds, <hi>That as in Baptism, because men are wont to wash with Water, and anoint them with Oyl, God has added to the Water and Oyl, the Grace of his Holy Spirit, and has made it the washing of Regeneration; so also, they being accustom'd to eat Bread, and to drink Wine and Water, he has joined them to his Divinity, and has made them his Body and Blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the same place, <hi>The Prophet Esay saw a light Coal; now the Coal is not of meer Wood, but it is joined to Fire; so also the Bread of the Eucharist is not common Bread, but it is united to the Divinity, and the Body which is united to the Divinity, is not one and the same Nature, but the Nature of the Body is one, and that of the Divinity which is united to it, is another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the same place, <hi>How is it that the Bread is made the Body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, and the Wine and Water his Blood? He answers, The Holy Ghost comes and disposes these things after such a manner as surpasseth our Thoughts and Expressions.</hi> The <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> are taken, <hi>Panis &amp; Vinum assumuntur,</hi> in Greek <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> composed of 338 Bishops, held in the <hi>viiith Century,</hi> for regulating the business of <hi>Image-worship,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <note place="margin">

Behold then, say they, <hi>the Image of his quickned Body, which was made after a precious and honourable manner.</hi> They affirm, that as the Word did not take a Person,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:66013:28"/>
that so the addition of a Person might not be made to the Divinity: so also he appointed, that an Image should be offered, which is a chosen matter, to wit, the <hi>Substance of Bread,</hi> that has not the Figure of Man, to avoid giving occasion of Idolatry: As then, <note place="margin">Conc. Const.</note> say they, the Body of Jesus Christ which is according to Nature, is Holy, as having been Deified; so also 'tis apparent, that that Body also that is by Institution, is Holy, and it's Image is Holy, as having been Deified by Grace, by a kind of Sanctification. They maintain, that as the Human Nature was Deified by its Union with the Word, so also the <hi>Bread</hi> of the Sacrament, as the true Image of the natural Flesh of Jesus Christ, is sanctified by the coming of the Holy Ghost, and becomes the Body of Jesus Christ, <hi>because the Priest transfers the Oblation from the state of a common thing, to something that is Holy.</hi> To conclude, they clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly distinguish the natural Flesh of Jesus Christ, which is living and intelligent, from his Image, which is the Heavenly Bread, filled with the Holy Spirit. All these continued Expressions are so far from any <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> that one must needs see, that the <hi>destruction of the Bread and Wine</hi> in the Sacrament, was not believed by the Fathers of the Council, nor by the Church in their time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alcuin</hi> speaking of the Consecrating of Bread and Wine to be the Body and Blood of Christ, saith, that the Sanctification of this <note place="margin">Alcuinus.</note> Mystery doth foreshew to us the effect of our Salvation: <hi>That by the Water is signified the Christian People; by the grains of the Wheat</hi>

                     <hi>ground into Meal to make Bread, is meant the Union of the Universal Church which is made one Body by the Fire of the Holy Ghost, which unites the Members to the Head; and that by the Wine is shewed the Blood of the Passion of the Lord.</hi> Doubtless <hi>Alcuin</hi> did not believe <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> seeing he places in the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Jesus Christ; and that he saith by the <hi>Wine</hi> is shewed the <hi>Blood</hi> of Jesus Christ; for that which is a Figure, and that which is figured; that which sheweth, and that which is shewed, are two different things, the one of which is not the other.

Can it be said that one doth bite the <hi>true Body</hi> of Jesus Christ, and that one breaks off part of it? <hi>4thly,</hi> It adds, <hi>he is to take great heed that no part of the Body and Blood of the Lord doth remain in the Chalice, or on the Plate.</hi> By these words, the <hi>Roman</hi> Order gives us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that it speaks of such a <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> that a part of it may be separated from the whole: Now this is what can only be said of the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>VVine,</hi> improperly called the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ.</p>

The now <hi>Roman</hi> Order at present used in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> doth also furnish us with the like reflections. It expresly marketh, That Jesus Christ gave in the Oblation, <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Mysteries of his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood.</hi> Therein is desired, That <note place="margin">Ordo Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</note> this Blessed Oblation may be accepted of God in such a manner, as that it might be made <hi>to us</hi> the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Jesus Christ; after all which, is recited the History of the Institution, and the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal words. The Eucharist is called, <hi>the Sacred Bread of Eternal Life; and the Cup, the Cup of everlasting Salvation.</hi> To conclude, They pray God to behold those Gifts, and that he will accept them as he did the offering of <hi>Abel,</hi> and the Sacrifice of <hi>Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck,</hi> which it's very well known, was <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine.</hi> All which doth plainly shew, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Order at this time observed, cannot reasonably be interpreted, but in supposing that the <hi>Bread and Wine remain in the Eucharist after Consecration.</hi>

It is this Mystery which the Church doth celebrate, having put an end to the ancient sacrifices, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bread, because of the bread which came down from Heaven; and wine, because of him which said, I am the true Vine; to the end that by the visible Oblation of Priests, and by the invisible consecration of the Holy Ghost, the bread and wine should have the dignity of the body and blood of our Lord, with which blood there is mingled some water, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because there came out of the side of our Saviour water with the blood; or because according to the Interpretation of our Ancestors, as Jesus Christ is signify'd by the wine, so also the people is signify'd by the water.</hi>

The Opposers of <hi>Paschasius Radbertus</hi> Frier of the Monastry of <hi>Corby,</hi> who wrote a Book of the <hi>body</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> of Jesus Christ, did not believe <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> That the said <hi>Paschasius</hi> had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral adversaries, appears by his own Writings, for towards the <note place="margin">Opposers of <hi>Paschasius Radbertus.</hi>
                     </note> end of his Commentary upon St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> he saith himself, <hi>I have inlarged upon the Lords Supper a little more than the brevity of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary would permit, because there be several others that are of a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent judgment touching these holy Mysteries, and that several are blind, and do not perceive that this bread and cup is nothing else but what is seen with the eyes, and tasted with the palate.</hi> And in his Epistle to <hi>Frudegard,</hi> as well as in his Commentary on St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> ch. 12. it appears he had Opposers, because in his Epist. to <hi>Frudegard,</hi> he saith, <hi>You advise with me touching a thing that many do make doubt of.</hi> And in his Commentary, <hi>I am told that many,</hi> saith he, <hi>do cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure me, as if I had attributed to the words of our Lord, either more, or something quite contrary to what the genuine sense permits.</hi> So that <hi>Paschasius</hi> had adversaries, and they did not believe <hi>Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> because they held that in the Eucharist, <hi>there was only the virtue of the flesh, and not the very flesh; the virtue of the blood, and not the very blood of Christ. That the Eucharist was figure, and not verity; shadow of the body, and not the body it self. They would,</hi> saith Paschasius, <hi>extenuate the word,</hi> body, <hi>and perswade, Quod non sit ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra caro Christi, sed quaedam virtus &amp; figura corporis Christi.</hi> Now <hi>Paschasius Rathbertus</hi> was the first Author that wrote fully and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously of the <hi>truth</hi> of the <hi>body</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> of Jesus Christ in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> saith, <hi>de Scriptoribus Ecclesiasticis in Paschasio Ratberto.</hi> And Father <hi>Sirmond</hi> saith, he is the first that hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd the sense of the Church touching this <hi>Mystery;</hi> so that, saith he, he hath opened the way to others, <hi>In vitae Ratberti prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixa ejus operibus.</hi> Therefore it is nothing strange that <hi>Paschasius</hi> had enemies, and that he was accused for departing from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Faith, and to have spread abroad Visions of a young Man. For he saith to <hi>Frudegard, You have,</hi> saith he, <hi>at the end of this Work, the Authorities of Catholick Fathers succinctly marked, by which you may perceive, that 'twas not through rashness, that formerly when I was young I believed these things, but by Divine authority.</hi> He also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to clear himself from this charge in alledging passages, as of Saint <hi>Austins,</hi> the which nevertheless are not to be found in him; as these words, <hi>Receive in the Bread what hung on the Cross, receive in the Cup what issued out of the side of Jesus Christ.</hi> Which is not to be found in St. <hi>Austin.</hi>

For as the material food, doth materially nourish the Body and support it, so also the Word of God doth nourish the Soul inwardly, and doth strengthen it.</hi> And in the same place, <hi>The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is one thing, and the virtue of the Sacrament is another. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is turned into the nourishment of the Body, but by the virtue of the Sacrament one acquires everlasting life. As the Sacrament therefore is turn'd into our selves, when we do eat and drink it, so also we are converted into the Body of Jesus Christ, when we live with Piety and Obedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The same Doctor on St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> Chap. 26. saith with Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Beda,</hi> that Jesus Christ hath substituted instead of the Flesh and Blood of the Paschal Lamb, the <hi>Sacrament of his Body and Blood.</hi> That the Creator of the World, and the Redeemer of Mankind, <hi>making of the very fruits of the Earth, that is to say, of Bread and Wine, a fit Mystery, turn'd it into the Sacrament of his Body and Blood, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened Bread and Wine mixt with water, must be sanctified to be the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Afterwards he gives the reason wherefore our Saviour chose <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> to make them Sacraments of his <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> and saith, that 'tis because <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> offer'd <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> and that Jesus Christ being a Priest after the Order of <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> he was to imitate his Oblation. And shewing the Reason why the Sacrament takes the name of the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of the Lord, he saith with <hi>Isidore</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Sevil, 'Tis because Bread strengthens the Body, it is conveniently called the Body of Jesus Christ; and because Wine augments Blood in the Flesh and Veins, for this reason it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to the Blood. Now both these things are visible, nevertheless being sanctifi'd by the Holy Ghost, they pass into the Sacrament of the Divine Body.</hi> A Sacrament which in the 33. <hi>Chap.</hi> he calls the <hi>Mystical Body</hi> of Jesus Christ, in opposition to his <hi>Natural Body,</hi> from which he distinguishes it, and draws a resemblance from the Mystical Body, to the proper Body of Jesus Christ. <hi>The holy Vessels,</hi> saith he, <hi>are set on the Altar,</hi> viz. <hi>the Cup and Patten, which in some sort are the figure of the Grave of Jesus Christ; for as at that time the Body of</hi>

                     <hi>Jesus Christ was laid in the Sepulcher, having been embalm'd by godly People; so also at present, the Mystical Body of Jesus Christ, as it were imbalm'd with holy Prayers, is kept in the holy Vessels to be administred to Believers by the hands of the Ministers.</hi>

As for the Sacrament of the Body and Blood, it is made of corporeal and visible things, but it produceth an invisible sanctification, as well to the Body as to the Soul. What reason is there, that that which is digested in the Stomack, and is cast out into the draft, should return to its former state, there being never any that affirmed that such a thing was done? For of late some persons not having a right Judgment of the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ, have said, that the same Body, and the same Blood of the Lord which was Born of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>and in which the Lord suffered on the Cross, and rose again from the Dead, is the same which is taken at the Altar; against which Error we have as much as was necessary written to the Abbot</hi> Egilon, <hi>explaining what ought truly to be believed of the Body of Christ in the Eucharist.</hi>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:66013:32"/>
some part may be flung out of the Mouth; That he will not dispute whether this <hi>Body</hi> evaporates in the Air, or whether it departs out of the <hi>body</hi> with the <hi>blood,</hi> or whether it goes out at the pores, or into the Draft, all this doth sufficiently shew, That this Doctor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished <note place="margin">Amalarius.</note> the <hi>Bread and Wine,</hi> as a <hi>Typical body,</hi> from the <hi>real Body</hi> of Jesus Christ; and that by consequence, he believed the <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine</hi> remained after Consecration, to be called the <hi>body and blood</hi> of Jesus Christ, but improperly.</p>

                        <hi>Divine Virtue and Efficacy.</hi> A little after he saith again, <hi>As the Water represents the People in the Sacrament, if it were true, that the Bread consecrated by Ministers was corporally changed into the Body of Jesus Christ, it must also necessarily follow, that the Water which is mingled with it were changed into the Blood of the faithful people; for where there is but one Sanctification, there ought to be but one Operation; and the Mystery should be equal where the Reason of the Mystery is the same. It is evident there is no corporal change in the Water, and by consequence, there is no corporal change to be expected in the wine. All that is said of the Body of the people represented by water, is understood spiritually; it is then a necessary consequence, that what is said of the Blood of Jesus Christ represented by the wine, must be understood spiritually. Again, The things which differ amongst themselves, are not one and the same thing. The Body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ which was dead and rose again, and become immortal, doth dye no more, Death has no more dominion over it, it is Eternal, and can no more suffer; but that which is celebrated in the Church is temporal and not eternal, and it is corruptible and not incorruptible.</hi> And again; <hi>it must then be said, that the body of Jesus Christ, such as it is made in the Church, was incorruptible and eternal. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it cannot be denied that what is so cut into morsels to be eat, changed and corrupted, and that being eat with the teeth, it goes into the Body.</hi> Again, <hi>Now 'tis true that the figure and the reallity are things distinct, therefore the body and blood which are celebrated in the Church, are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the flesh and blood of the Body of Jesus Christ, which it is well known, is glorious since his Resurrection, therefore the body that we celebrate is a pledg and figure.</hi>

                        <hi>ought much rather to be attributed to the spiritual Bread which perfectly strengthens all Men, and all Creatures, because 'tis by him we Live, Move, and have our Being.</hi> He blessed it: <hi>He</hi> blessed <hi>it first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as in his Person he blessed all Mankind, then afterwards he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Christianus Drutmanes.</note> 
                        <hi>that the blessing and power of the Divine and Immortal Nature was truly in that Nature which he had taken from the Virgin</hi> Mary. He broke it: <hi>He</hi> broke <hi>the Bread which was Himself, because exprsing himself willingly to Death, he broke and shattered the Habitation of his Soul, to the end that he might satisfie us, according to what himself saith,</hi> I have power to lay down my Life, or to save it. <hi>And</hi> he gave it to his Disciples, saying to them, Take and Eat, this is my Body. <hi>He</hi> gave <hi>to his Disciples the Sacrament of his Body for the Remission of Sins, and for the keeping of Charity, to the end that not forgetting this action, they should always perform this in Figure, and that they should not be unmindful of what he was about to do for them.</hi> This is my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>that is to say,</hi> Sacramentally; <hi>and having taken the</hi> Cup, <hi>he</hi> bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>it, and</hi> gave <hi>it to his Disciples. As amongst all things which are necessary to preserve Life, Bread and Wine are those that do most of all repair and strengthen the weakness of Nature: It is with great reason that our Saviour was pleas'd in these two things to establish the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Sacrament; for Wine rejoyces the heart, and increases Blood, therefore it is very fit to</hi> represent <hi>the Blood of Jesus Christ, because whatsoever comes from him, rejoyces with true Joy, and encreaseth whatsoever there is of good in us. To conclude, as a Person that is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a long Journey, leaves to those u hom be loves, some particular pledg of his kindness, on condition that they should look daily upon it, to the end that they may retain him always in Remembrance; so in like manner, God by</hi> spiritually changing <hi>the Bread into his Body, and the Wine into his Blood, has commanded us to celebrate this Mystery, that these two things should make us never forget what he hath done for us with his Body and Blood, and keep us from being unthankful and ungrateful for his so tender Love. Now because water is wont to be mingled with the Sacrament of his Blood, this Water represents the People for whom Jesus Christ was pleas'd to suffer, and the Water is not without the Wine, nor the Wine without the Water, because as he died for us, so also we should be ready to die for Him, and for our Brethren, that is to say, for the Church, therefore there came out of his side Water and Blood.</hi>

He is eaten by parcels in the Sacrament, and remains whole and intire in Heaven, and whole and intire in our Hearts. Again, All that is done in this Oblation of the Body and Blood of our Saviour, is a Mystery, we there see one thing, and we understand another; what we see, hath a corporal substance; what we understand, hath a spiritual Fruit.</hi> He saith, <hi>Jesus Christ saith to them, take, eat ye all of this; and speaking of the Cup, The Wine,</hi> saith he, <hi>was the Mystery of our Redemption, and he proves it by these words, I will drink no more of the Fruit of the Vine.</hi> To conclude, Explaining these last words of the Canon, <hi>By which, O Lord, thou daily makest these good things for us,</hi> which contain a kind of Thanksgiving, which in the <hi>Latin</hi> Liturgy does follow the Consecration; he sufficiently intimates to us, that he did not believe the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> were changed into the substance of the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Jesus Christ, seeing he speaks of them, as things God had created from the beginning of the World, which he creates every year by Propagation and Reparation, which he san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies, which he sills with Grace and Heavenly Benediction, the which himself expounds to be <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine.</hi>

                     <hi>Eucharist, is compos'd of several Grains of Wheat, without Blood, without Bones, Nerves, and without a Soul. The Body of Christ which suffer'd Death, and rose again, shall never dye more, it is Eternal and Immortal; but the Eucharist is temporal and not eternal, it is corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>

                     <hi>and divided into sundry parcels, ground by the Teeth, and goes along with the other Excrements. This Sacrament is a pledg and figure; the Body of Jesus Christ is the Truth it self; we have this pledg Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally until we attain to the Truth, and then the pledg shall be fulfill'd.</hi> And a little lower, <hi>If we consider the Eucharist after a corporal man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, we see 'tis a changeable and corruptible Creature; but if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the spiritual Virtue that is in it, we easily see that Life abides in it, and that it gives Immortality to those that receive it with Faith. There is great difference betwixt the invisible Virtue of this Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and the visible Form of its proper Nature. By Nature it is corruptible Bread, and corruptible Wine, but by the Virtue of the Word of God, it is truly his Body and Blood, yet not corporally but spiritually.</hi> A little below, he explains this change, in saying, <hi>Jesus Christ by an invisible Virtue did change the Bread and Wine into his Body and Blood; but 'twas after the same manner as he heretofore changed Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, and the Water that came out of the Rock, into the same Body and Blood.</hi>

                     <hi>Ratherius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Verona</hi> saith, As to the Corporal substance which the Communicant doth receive, seeing that 'tis I that do <note place="margin">Ratherius.</note> now ask the Question, I must also answer my self, and <hi>I</hi> thereto <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Opinions of Authors of the</hi> THIRTEENTH CENTURY, <hi>and afterwards, touching</hi> Transubstantiation.</head>
                  <p>IT's true, Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> did condemn this <hi>Amaury</hi> at the Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> after his Death, in the year 1215. but 'tis not said wherefore; and what was transacted in this Council, deserves not to be much regarded, if it be consider'd after what manner things were there transacted. The Pope, who then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided, was a man full of vain Glory and Ambition; <hi>Mathew Paris</hi> and <hi>Mathew of Westminster</hi> intimate so much of him, and that the liberty of voting and speaking was denied to the Prelates of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, for they were not seen to propose, nor deliberate, nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise, nor prepare any of the Constitutions which were there in great numbers; but they were presented to the Council ready drawn up, it not appearing that the advice of the Assembly was taken on each of them, as is usually practis'd in all free and lawful Councils. <hi>Mathew Paris,</hi> on the year 1215. speaks in these terms, Every one being Assembled in the place abovesaid, and each having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the custom of the General Councils, taken their place, the Pope having first made an Exhortatory Sermon, there was read in full Council Sixty Articles; which were liked by some, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked by others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Godfry</hi> a Fryer of St. <hi>Pantalion</hi> at <hi>Cologne,</hi> saith, There was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth the remembrance done at this Council, only that the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ad Ann.</hi> 1215.</note> 
                     <hi>Eastern</hi> Church submitted to the <hi>Western,</hi> which before was never known. <hi>Naucerlus</hi> and <hi>Platina,</hi> in the Life of <hi>Innocent</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> affirm the same, for they mark, that several things were there propos'd, but that nothing was clearly determin'd. And Kings and Princes have no Reason to allow of this Council, because in the <hi>3d</hi> Chap. of the said Council, Power is given to the Pope to deprive Princes and Lords of their Lands, and to give them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>

                     <hi>Guy leGros</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Narbonne,</hi> in the year 1268. did not believe <hi>Transubstantiation;</hi> for being at <hi>Rome,</hi> and discovering his
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:66013:40"/>
mind to a certain Doctor, being return'd to <hi>Narbonne,</hi> Pope <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the IV. wrote him a Letter, telling him that a certain Doctor inform'd him, that discoursing with him, he held that the Body of Christ was not essentially in the Sacrament, and no otherwise than as the thing signified is in the Sign; and that he said also this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was common at <hi>Paris.</hi> This appears by the Register'd Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript of the Letters of <hi>Clement</hi> the IV. And to shew that the Arch Bishop of <hi>Narbonne</hi> said this Doctrine was very frequent at <hi>Paris;</hi> we find that two years after, that is to say, in the year 1270. which was in the year St. <hi>Lewis</hi> died; <hi>Stephen</hi> Bishop of <hi>Paris,</hi> by advice of some Doctors in Divinity, condemned those which held, that God cannot make an Accident to be without a Subject, because it is of its Essence to be actually in its Subject. <hi>2ly,</hi> That the Accident without a Subject, is not evident, unless it be equivocal. <hi>3ly,</hi> That to make the Accident subsist without its Subject, as we think it does in the Eucharist, is a thing impossible, and implies a Contradiction. <hi>4ly,</hi> That God cannot make the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident be without its Subject, neither that it should have several Dimensions. Which Maxims being inconsistent with <hi>Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> doth plainly shew, that even at that time, Men were divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Subject of <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> One <hi>William,</hi> saith the Fryer <hi>Walsingham,</hi> in the Life of <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> on the year 1381. Preached at <hi>Leicester</hi> on <hi>Palm-Sunday, That the Sacrament of the Altar is real Bread after Consecration;</hi> and that the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> going to punish him for it, the People appearing concern'd for him, made the Bishop not dare do any thing against him, which doth plainly shew, that in that time the Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> had not taken any deep root in the minds of the People.</p>

                  <p>The same <hi>John de Paris</hi> wrote the Treatise above mention'd, about the year 1300. he was a <hi>Jacobin,</hi> and Doctor of the <hi>Sorbon;</hi> he held that the Eucharist is the Body of Christ, as <hi>Rupert de Duits,</hi> and <hi>Guy</hi> of <hi>Cluvigny</hi> did, to wit, by Assumption, Jesus Christ ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken the Bread into the Unity of his <hi>Suppositum,</hi> as he took the human Nature into the Unity of his Person. And towards the end of the Manuscript it is said, That the faculty thought fit, that the manner of explaining the Eucharist, by <hi>Assumption</hi> of the <hi>Bread,</hi> or by <hi>Conversion,</hi> was a <hi>probable Opinion; but that neither the one nor the other was decided as a matter of Faith; and that whoever said otherwise, did not say well,</hi> and run the risque of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. <hi>In praesentia Collegii Magistrorum in Theologia dictum est;</hi> (says the end of the Manuscript) <hi>utrumque modum ponendi Corpus Christi esse in Altare tenet pro Opinioni probabili, &amp; approbat utrumque per.—Et per dicta Sanctorum.
