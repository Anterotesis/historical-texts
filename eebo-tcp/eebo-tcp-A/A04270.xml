            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. DA. M.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath been the cuſtome of them
that penned the Booke of Bookes,
the Bible, to direct ſeuerall wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
to ſome particular and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
perſons, although it was in
their mindes, that the Church in
generall ſhould alſo receiue edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and comfort by them. So then I haue in this reſpect
trod in their ſtepps, whoſe patterne cannot but be worth
the imitation. Were it as conuenient, as lawfull, I would
fully haue ſet downe your name: but (to auoide the leaſt
appearance of euill) I haue omitted that; and though
many reaſons might be produced, why I made choice of
you before others, yet it would be tedious, and to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to relate them; wherefore let theſe following ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
I aſſure my ſelfe that it will be well accepted, and
(as from the hands of a true (though meane) friend)
receiued. I alſo (ſo farre as my iudgement leades me)
verily beleeue, that the Lord hath begun his good worke
in you: wherefore, though the meanes be but weake, the
powerfull Creator can vſe it, as an instrument to fur-ther
<pb facs="tcp:16882:3"/>
the ſame. He that could cure the blind man with clay
and ſpittle, can produce the like effects by an ordinarie
meanes, who doubteth? I will not proclaime to the eares
of the world, what kindneſſes I haue receiued from you
(for that might ſeeme to ſmell of flattery; or by a more
ſecret manner of begging, to craue ſome future fauour).
But this I will onely mention, that it is out of Christian
affection, and a ſingular deſire of your good &amp; comfort;
as alſo to declare my remembrance of you, that I haue in
this kind put pen to paper. And to ſay much in one
word: If I haue more than an ordinary affection to any
priuate perſon, the current thereof runneth towards your
ſelfe. Let theſe lines (what euer they be) therefore the
rather find a friendly entertainement: and not ſo onely,
but eſpecially ſtriue to apply them to what end I haue
aimed at, in the penning of them. They will plainely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
vnto you, by what meanes we are to ſtand iust be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God; of which mystery the vulgar people are (for
the most part) ignorant of, or not thorowly grounded in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Againe, you ſhall find in them, that the ſpiritual eſtate
of a Christian is ſecret, not onely to others, but often hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
from himſelfe, eſpecially at the time of his effectuall
vocation; for then he is like the late manured field, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and bare, without the leaſt true apprehenſion, or
ſight of ſauing grace, and good graine in the furrowes of
his ſoule. By this you may vnderſtand, who are the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of Gods greatest benefits. And finally, you ſhall
euidently ſee confuted the opinion of thoſe, that hold
there is no mirth or comfort in a Christian courſe; who
cry out, what? turne Puritane? become a Preciſian?
then farewell all ioy, and welcome melancholy. But we
ſay (leauing thoſe names to whom they of right pertaine)
<pb facs="tcp:16882:3"/>
that faith in the promiſes of God, and obedience to his
precepts, will expell feare, quiet the troubled ſoule, and
make a ſad heart the merriest man in the world: for
faith in the Goſpell ſets vs euen with God; and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the Law, will bring vs to his preſence, where all
the righteous and vpright-hearted, ſhall bathe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
in Riuers of pleaſure, that ſhall neuer be dried vp,
but ſpring, flow, and be full for euer. To the which
the Lord bring you in a conuenient ſeaſon,

               <bibl>PSAL. 97. 11.</bibl>
               <q>Light is ſowne for the righteous, and ioy for the vpright
in heart.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe words conſiſt of a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
propoſition; but ſome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
that, like <hi>Pharaohs</hi>
dreames, though diuers, the
ſame thing is onely meant.
Others thus;<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1. Pſal. 32. 2.</note> that the firſt
part of the verſe is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
of <hi>Iustification,</hi> the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Sanctification;</hi> for they both vſually goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and the one is neuer in Gods children ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the other: for if the Lord iuſtifie any
perſon through Chriſt, in ſome meaſure he ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
the ſame by his Spirit; theſe (like <hi>Naomi</hi> and
<hi>Ruth)</hi> runne together.</p>
            <p>In the former propoſition are two things to be
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:16882:5"/>
conſidered: firſt, that <hi>light is ſowen:</hi> ſecondly, for
whom, and that is <hi>for the righteous.</hi> Againe, in the
latter propoſition, are two things alſo to be noted;
the one, that <hi>ioy is ſowne;</hi> the other, who ſhall reape
it, <hi>viz. the vpright in heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for the better vnderſtanding of the words,
we muſt know, that this Text is an Allegory; that
is, a continued ſimilitude, wherein we may obſerue
fower things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the ſower; and that is <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the ſeede; and that is <hi>ioy and light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the reapers, and they be <hi>the iust and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
in heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, the ground where, and that is in <hi>Gods</hi>
Word and workes, earth and heauen, within vs
and without vs.</p>
            <p>This metaphor of huſbandry is often vſed in the
Scripture: for</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is of antiquitie; our firſt parents were to
till the ground.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is of good report; therefore to bee
thought vpon.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is profitable; for he that ſoweth ſhall
reape.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, it is of neceſſitie; for grounds muſt bee
plowed vp, or they will not bring forth any good
fruite, but briars, thiſtles, and all vnprofitable rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh.
Now wee will proceede to the meaning of
the words.</p>
            <p>And firſt for <hi>Light: Light</hi> is either taken litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
or tropically. Litterally two waies:</p>
            <p>Firſt, either for an accident or qualitie in a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16882:5"/>
as in the Sunne,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 3.</note> or any cleare body: or</p>
            <p>Secondly, as an effect, proceeding from its
cauſe; and ſo the Fier, Moone and ſtarres are ſaid
to be <hi>Lights,</hi> and <hi>to giue light, Gen.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11. 9.</p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>light</hi> is metaphorically applied many
waies.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>God</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>light,</hi> 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Christ</hi> is called <hi>the light, Iohn</hi> 3. 19.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Miniſters are ſtiled <hi>Lights, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
5. 14.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the Goſpell; <hi>walke in the light, Iohn</hi>
12. 36.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, the precepts and word was to <hi>Dauid, a
Lanthorne,</hi> or <hi>light, Pſal.</hi> 119. 105.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Grace is called <hi>light, Epheſ.</hi> 5. 13. 14.</p>
            <p>Seuenthly, deliuerance from danger, <hi>Esth.</hi> 8. 16.</p>
            <p>In a word, <hi>light</hi> is taken for all true comfort, and
ſpirituall bleſſings that wee receiue from God,
through Chriſt, temporal or eternal; and ſo it may
be taken in this place (though more particularly) of
deliuerance from trouble, or ſome preſent danger
the people of God were caſt into: for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Chriſt is fore-ſpoke of,<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 6.</note> and prophecied in

               <hi>For the righteous]</hi> Wee muſt vnderſtand, that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16882:6"/>
there is a twofold righteouſneſſe; and that either
perſonall, or by imputation.</p>
            <p>Perſonall righteouſneſſe hath in it two things;
firſt, integritie; ſecondly, conformitie: for there is
one frame of the perſon, another of his actions. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie
of nature muſt be in him that is perſonally
righteous,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7 vlt.</note> ſo was <hi>Adam, Eue</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> by creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
hence ſome conclude, that onely they three
were created in the image of God, and none other:
for <hi>God</hi> (in the beginning) <hi>made man righteous</hi>
(righteous in reſpect of his nature and being), and
<hi>Christ</hi> (afterward) as hee was man; for the Spirit
did ouerſhadow the Virgin, and purifie the matter
and maſſe of which his humane body conſiſted, ſo
that it was perfect, and without the ſtaine of the
leaſt originall ſinne. And againe, conformitie of
action is alſo of neceſſitie, to make a man perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and abſolutely righteous: the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had
the one, but failed in the other; therefore becauſe
he kept not the rule of iuſtice, he was neuer actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and perſonally righteous: the ſecond <hi>Adam,
Christ,</hi> had both; and ſo was able to abide the Law,
yea, the very rigour of it, either for puritie of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or holineſſe of conuerſation; and he onely,
and none but hee.<note place="margin">1. Iohn 2. 1.</note> Hence he is called, <hi>Ieſus Christ
the righteous:</hi> for he was righteous euery manner
of way. And although the firſt may bee without
the ſecond, yet the ſecond cannot be without the
firſt; becauſe the latter (as an effect, ſpringeth and
floweth from the former, as his true and proper
cauſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 24.</p>
            <p>And thus hauing declared what perſonall righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16882:6"/>
is, wee come to ſee what is meant by
righteouſneſſe imputed.</p>
            <p>Now imputed righteouſneſſe, is that righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
which is not in mans ſelfe, or from himſelfe,
but from and by another; not by creation, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.
This ſeemes to me to be prefigured by
the skinnes, wherewith the Lord, after the fall, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
our firſt Parents; the bodies of the beaſts
were for ſacrifice, the skinnes to put them in mind,
that their owne righteouſneſſe was like the figge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaues,
imperfect; and therefore they muſt bee iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
another way. Yet howeuer that be, <hi>Paul</hi> is
plaine for this diſtribution of double righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
for (ſaith he) <hi>I labour not to be found in mine
owne righteouſnes, which is by the Law, but that which
is by faith in Christ, Phil.</hi> 3. 9. So that it is manifeſt,
there is an imputatiue, as well as a perſonall righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.
And here we are to note two things in
righteouſneſſe imputed: firſt, what it is that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
righteous: ſecondly, how or by what meanes
we are made partakers of this that maketh vs righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.
The thing or matter is <hi>Christ</hi> and his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
<hi>Christ is made our righteouſneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi>
1. 30. And we muſt haue both his perſon and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to be the matter of our iuſtification: for we are
conceiued in ſinne; therefore we muſt haue a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
to ſatisfie the iuſtice of the Law in that:
for the parts of Diuinitie at the Creation, ſeeme to
be Holineſſe of nature, and Perfection of life; ſo
that this rule being iuſt and good, muſt be fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
either by our ſelues, or ſome other, elſe no
fleſh ſhould be iuſtified, or ſaued. Againe (I ſay) his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16882:7"/>
obedience muſt be imputed alſo, and that actiue
and paſſiue (the which ſome, but without iuſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
deny; affirming, that the paſſiue is of it ſelfe
ſufficient).</p>
            <p>And the reaſon is this: the Law after <hi>Adams</hi> fall
required a double debt; the one, that the breach
thereof might be repaired; the other, perfectly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed;
that, that was done, muſt be vndone; and
that which was vndone, muſt bee done: and by
whom? euen by <hi>Christ</hi> our ſurety. And obſerue
how fitly the actiue and paſſiue obedience of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
anſwere theſe two: for his paſſion remooued the
curſe, and his actiue obedience brings the bleſſing,
and confirmes man being reconciled. And this is
that which the Apoſtle intendeth (though ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
expound the place) where he ſaith, <hi>If by
the death of Christ</hi> (that is, his paſſiue obedience) <hi>we
be reconciled to God, when wee were enemies; much
more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaued by his life</hi> (that
is, his actiue obedience); <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10.</p>
            <p>For the better vnderſtanding of this, let vs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<hi>Adam</hi> vnto a pot, or ſome ſuch earthen veſſell;
firſt, it is framed, molded, and well figured; then it
is put into the ouen or furnace, and hardned. Now
ſuppoſe that this veſſell bee hit with a foote, and
daſhed in pieces before it was hardned; muſt it
not haue a double act to make it perfect, one to
mould it anew, another to ſeaſon and harden it?
Why, man by Creation was by God excellently
framed; but he was not hardned and confirmed by
the obedience of the Law, but broken to pieces in
daſhing himſelfe againſt it: ſo that now hee ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16882:7"/>
in need of more than at his creation; for he is
broken, therefore wants molding, and then harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
too; elſe notwithſtanding his caſe were mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and his condition ſubiect to breaking ſtill.
Now the paſſiue obedience of Chriſt doth frame
him anew, that is, ſet him in that condition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he was at the firſt by creation; and then his actiue
obedience like the furnace, doth confirme and
make him a veſſell vnchangeable, and fit for the
Lords vſe for euer. And doth it not ſtand with
iuſtice, that death ſhould remooue death, and
life procure life? I write my opinion (ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
my ſelfe to the iudgement of the reuerend
and learned), that the ground of this error had its
beginning from miſunderſtanding of perſonall
righteouſneſſe: for <hi>Adam</hi> was iuſt by creation, in
reſpect of his eſſentiall properties: but neuer actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
righteous in the obedience of the precepts by
practiſe; ſo that <hi>Adam</hi> was no ſinner, yet not iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:
for <hi>not a ſinner</hi> and <hi>a righteous perſon</hi> are not
equall and equiualent termes, they may not bee
conuerted; for <hi>Adam,</hi> though iuſt by creation, yet
not by action; ſo that he did but anſwere to one
part of the rule, not the other; neither could hee,
vntill this created righteouſneſſe had been produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
into act; for as the breach of the Law made
him actually a ſinner &amp; vniuſt, ſo the performance
of it would haue made him actually righteous, the
which he neuer was. The death of Chriſt will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
vs to that eſtate, from which we fell in <hi>Adam,</hi>
and that is, of <hi>enemies</hi> to make vs <hi>friends;</hi> and to
heale (meritoriouſly) our wounded nature: but his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16882:8"/>
life muſt confirme vs, and make vs actually iuſt:
and there can be no danger at all in holding this
doctrine; and I wonder that any man can either
aſcribe too much to <hi>Christ,</hi> or beleeue too much
in him: for if the breach, and the not keeping of the
Law be debts (as in truth they be), then (as <hi>Paul</hi>
writeth to <hi>Philemon</hi> concerning <hi>Oneſimus)</hi> let vs (in
all humilitie of heart by the hand of faith) <hi>ſet both
on Christs ſcore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much for the matter of our iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by which we are made righteous. The manner
how or by what meanes it is applied, followeth,
and that is <hi>faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 3.</note> and <hi>faith onely: for we are iustified
by faith onely,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note>
               <hi>as by an instrumentall cauſe;</hi> for faith
laieth hold on the obiect matter of our iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>his</hi> obedience;<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1. 10.</note> and ſo vniting the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer
to him, hee is iuſtified, though not by his
owne inherent and actuall righteouſneſſe. So that
<hi>God</hi> the Father accepteth of this ſatisfaction, as if
we in our owne perſons had, both for holineſſe of
nature, and perfection of obedience, abſolutely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
and fulfilled the Lawes iuſtice.</p>
            <p>And from this that I haue ſaid, we may gather
theſe concluſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, that</hi> None was euer perſonally righteous, but
Christ onely.</p>
            <p>For if his Father <hi>would marke what was done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe,</hi>
yet he was, and is, and euer ſhall be <hi>able to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
it:</hi> for he was holy for nature, and perfect for
life.</p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 9.</note> hence it will follow, that <hi>all men ſtand in
neede of Chriſts merits;</hi> and <hi>all cauſe of boaſting is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:16882:8"/>
excluded from mankind:</hi> yea (whatſoeuer Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
babble) the bleſſed Virgin her ſelfe. So that
the perſon for whom light is ſowne, is hee that by
faith applieth Chriſt and his obedience (being offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the Father) to himſelfe in particular.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, we may from this ſafely conclude,
that</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They who haue no faith cannot be iustified, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
ſaued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For wee muſt of neceſſitie haue faith to apply
Chriſt as an inſtrument;<note place="margin">Rom. 13. vlt.</note> for faith is as a hand to
receiue, and put on the righteouſneſſe and merits
of the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hab. 2. 4.</note> We are ſaid to <hi>liue by faith:</hi>
that is, in <hi>beleeuing</hi> in the Lord of life. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that haue no faith,<note place="margin">Epheſ 2. 1.</note> are <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and
ſinnes. Adam</hi> had life in himſelfe at the creation:
now we haue it out of our ſelues from Chriſt at our
iuſtification.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And laſt of all we may collect, that</hi> the obiect of
faith and matter of iustification is not within vs, but
without vs; <hi>and that</hi> we ſtand in need of the ſame, elſe
no ſaluation; <hi>whence theſe three Corollaries fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, that</hi> ſinnes before conuerſion cannot hinder
mans perfect iuſtification. <hi>Let this bee well obeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, that <hi>good workes after our effectuall vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
doe not further our iustification before the Lord,
they</hi> will helpe to aſſure vs, that our faith is ſound;
and iuſtifie vs in the eyes of the world, but no other
waies.</p>
            <p>And laſtly from this I alſo conclude, that <hi>They
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16882:9"/>
are in a great errour, who hold the bare act of faith
without the application of Christ and his obedience to
iustifie.</hi> We are ſaid to liue by our hands, yet wee
vnderſtand, that it is meant by that we get by labor
and trauell; for no man eates his fingers: ſo wee
may truly be ſaid to be iuſtified and ſaued through
faith; but wee muſt know, that it is by what faith
reſteth on, and applieth to the perſon, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe;
this is the plaine meaning.</p>
            <p>And now I come to the ſecond branch of my
text, <hi>and ioy].</hi> Some expound the firſt part by the
ſecond, and ſay, that by <hi>light</hi> is meant <hi>ioy;</hi> and by
<hi>iuſt, vpright</hi> in <hi>heart.</hi> But I rather vnderſtand, that
<hi>ſanctification</hi> is meant in this clauſe: for many are
apt to ſay, they haue faith, yet want holineſſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ſpirit would take away that falſe cauill.</p>
            <p>Againe, good and righteous perſons call the
ſoundneſſe of their faith ſometimes into queſtion,
doubting of the truth of their ſpirituall condition;
therefore to remoue that ſcruple, and to comfort
and ſettle their wauering minds, the Prophet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexeth
as a helpe this other clauſe, wherein is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
<hi>ſanctification.</hi> And vſually in the holy
Booke, theſe two are coupled together, and they
may not be put aſunder, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11.</p>
            <p>Now for the interpretation of the words: ſome
reade <hi>ioy,</hi> others <hi>gladneſſe;</hi> the difference of theſe
two I take to be this: Ioy is in the heart, ſecretly
hidden: and gladneſſe may be ſeene in the face, or
by ſome outward ſigne diſcerned: for where one
<hi>Euangeliſt</hi> writeth, <hi>Reioyce and bee glad;</hi> another
ſaith, <hi>Reioyce and leape.</hi> Feare and ioy are internall,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16882:9"/>
but trembling and gladneſſe externall: See <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.
12. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vpright]</hi> Seemes to be a Metaphor tooke from
a pillar, or thing that ſtandeth (as wee ſay) bolt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
not inclining more one way than another;
or ſome reade it <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Streight of heart;</hi> that is,
in whoſe thoughts, intentions and conuerſations is
no guile, like <hi>Nathanaël,</hi> or <hi>Ezekiah;</hi> and <hi>heart</hi> is
added, to ſhew the true roote of ſinceritie, as alſo
to condemne outward hypocriſie: for ſome, like
the old Phariſies, are iuſt outwardly, but inwardly
full of rottennes; the heart is not vpright, what
ſhew ſoeuer they make of holineſſe and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
or it may be annexed for the comfort of the
iuſt, that though they faile ſometimes in outward
act, yet it falleth foorth contrary to the intent and
former purpoſe of their heart: for the moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
hath his failings, whatſoeuer his reſolutions
haue been to the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now in few other words, thus may we plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſolue theſe.</hi> What if the faithfull be afflicted?
ouerwhelmed with the waues of ſorrow? compaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with great and manifold euils? drowned in the
depth of depths? and well neere ſwallowed vp of ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
heauineſſe? ſhall they not heare of glad tidings?
will not ioy breake out as light in the morning? and all
teares be wiped from their eyes? yes, this is an eternall
truth, that, All ſuch as are iuſtified by faith in Chriſt;
ſanctified (hauing hearts without guile) by the word
and ſpirit; though they ſow in teares, plow in paine, and
all their crop ſeeme to be blaſted; yet there be great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
appointed by God for them; which (though for a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16882:10"/>
ſeaſon they be couered, and hidden like corne in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes)
they ſhall one day reape and receiue in earth and
