            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His <hi>verse</hi> is a Prophecy of the deliverance
of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> from the siege by Sennacherib;
of which you have the compleat Hystory
afterwards in this Book: Chap. 36.
Chap. 37.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>first verse</hi> of this Chapter, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is made of <hi>Two</hi> dark seasons, which affected the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Israel. One</hi> was, when <hi>Tiglath Pilezer</hi> invaded
part of the Land, and carryed part of the people into
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100624:4"/>
Captivity; of which you may read, 2. <hi>Kings,</hi> 15. 29.
The <hi>other</hi> was, when <hi>Salmanaser</hi> over-run the whol Land,
carryed captive the generality of the people, and set an
end to that Kingdom. The Lord comforteth his people
of the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> that the trouble, which was to
come upon them by <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> should not be so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,
as either of these. For saith he; <hi>Nevertheles the
dimness shall not be such, as was in her vexation; when at the
first he lightly afflicted the land of</hi> Zebulun, <hi>and the Land of</hi>
Naphtali, <hi>and afterwards did more grievously affict her by the
way of the Sea,</hi> Jordan <hi>in</hi> Galile <hi>of the Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>second verse</hi> is a great Promise of Deliverance. <hi>The
people that walked in darkness, have seen a great light: they that
dwel in the Land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light
shined.</hi> The Prophet speaks of al the <hi>Jews</hi> in both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
as one Body. When the Kingdome of <hi>Israel</hi> was
laid wast, it is probable, that many of those ten Tribes
fled into the land of <hi>Judah.</hi> When <hi>Sennacherib</hi> invaded
<hi>Judah,</hi> ruining the Countreys, as he passed, with his
army; the multitude of the people retyred before him
into <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> The King of <hi>Assyria</hi> besiegeth that great
City, and with his mighty Army over shadows it, as with
<hi>Darkness,</hi> and the <hi>shadow of Death.</hi> Now in the thickness
of this darkness a light ariseth, and shines forth upon the
people by the prayer of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> the prophecy of <hi>Esaiah,</hi>
the descent of the Lord from Heaven by a mighty
<hi>Angel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Behold the difference, which God makes between the
Kingdom of <hi>Israel,</hi> and of <hi>Judah;</hi> those, who set up
Calves to themselves; who worship the maker of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and Earth, after the Imaginations of their own
heart, in the Images, and works of their own hands:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100624:4"/>
and those, who worship him in his own Temple at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
which is a figure of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> the only Image of
the Invisible God, as he makes himself known to us by
his own Spirit.</p>
            <p>You have <hi>three</hi> sences of the <hi>first</hi> part of the 3. verse,
<hi>Thou hast meltiplyed the Nation, and hast not increased the joy:</hi>
Some apply this to <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> Army, which was so nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,
and a Collection of so many Nations. The
Heathen were gathered together agaiust <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in vast
numbers: but they had no joy in it, proportionable to
their Combinations, and their Confidence. Others
interpret it of the <hi>Jews</hi> shut up in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> during
the siege. You may read the words, as the <hi>Margin</hi> points
it out to you, in stead of; <hi>Thou hast not increased the joy;
thou hast increased the joy to hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi> that is to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who
was then King of <hi>Judah;</hi> as if he should say; <hi>Thou hast by
occasion of this siege multiplied the people round about</hi> Hezekiah
<hi>in</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and now in the Eyes of them al thou settest him
up on high, and increas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st his joy, by that Miracle, which thou
workest to deliver them for his sake.</hi> Or else, there is a sweet
<hi>Antithesis,</hi> or <hi>Opposition</hi> in the words. <hi>On</hi> Sennacheribs
<hi>part thou multipliest the Nation, his Army, and outward stren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gths:
but thou increasest the joy to</hi> Hezekiah. <hi>They joy before
thee according to the joy of harvest, and as men rejoyce, when they
divide the Spoile.</hi> This was the joy of the people of God,
when they came forth from the City, and found the dead
bodys of their enemies lying in the fields, like Corn new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cut down, and their treasures, like ful Ears of
Corn.</p>
            <p>We may observe <hi>two</hi> things from this <hi>verse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, The end of affliction frequently is to gather up
beleevers close to <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in his own person, or in the
Anoyntings of his spirit upon some chosen ones; that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100624:5"/>
he may increase the honor, and joy of these in the sight
of al the people, by that Salvation, which he works
thorow them, and for their sakes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The joy of the Saints in their deliverances is
a <hi>Double</hi> joy; a <hi>Harvest</hi> of spiritual glories, and consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the appearances of God to them: the <hi>spoil</hi> of
the enemy, whose Power, and wealth becomes theirs,
while they are cut off by the appearances of God for his
beloved. Thus <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> at the same time ascended into
Heaven to the Father, and spoyled the powers, and
Principalities of this world, carrying Captivity Captive,
Thus our Savior tels the Saints, that what ever they lose,
that is dear to them in this world, they shal have it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<hi>an hundred-fold, and everlasting Life.</hi> There is the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
of Spiritual joyes, <hi>everlasting Life.</hi> There is the
spoil of the enemy, and Captivity Captivated, when they
recover al the Beautys, joyes, sweetnesses of this world
out of the hand of the enemy, and have them <hi>an hundred-fold;
by possessing</hi> al, even that, which was the enemies
too; <hi>by having</hi> al after a loss, a fight, by a victory; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
al natural joyes heighthned by their Vnion with spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
enjoyments.</p>
            <p>The deliverance of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> from <hi>Sennacherib</hi> is set out
in verse, 4. by a comparison with the destruction of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian.
Thou hast broken the yoke of his burthen, and the staff of
his Shoulder and the rod of his oppressour, as in the day of</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian.
You may see the story of <hi>Midian</hi> in the <hi>seventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of <hi>Judges.</hi> It was wholly miraculous, and had these
<hi>Eztraordinary</hi> things in it. First, God divided <hi>Gideon's</hi>
Army from him by one Division upon another, until he
had lessened it from <hi>thirty thousand,</hi> to <hi>three hundred;</hi> vers.
3. 6, 7. Secondly, The terror upon the spirit of the
<hi>Midianites,</hi> and courage infused into <hi>Gideon</hi> by a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100624:5"/>
dream; verse, 13, 14, 15. Thirdly, The manner of the
victory on <hi>Gideon's</hi> part, who with his men stood stil,
breaking their pitchers, holding forth their Lamps,
blowing with their Trumpets, crying; <hi>The Sword of the
Lord, and of</hi> Gideon; which were al signs of faith, and
Prayer, of the vertue of the Death, Resurrection, Glory,
and Spirit of the Lord Jesus in the Gospel: verse, 20 21.
Fourthly, the destruction of the <hi>Midianites</hi> one by another
before that <hi>Gideon,</hi> or his men strik one strok. The
overthrow of <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> and his Army holds a resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
with that of <hi>Midian;</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> in the miraculous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it; in <hi>particulars;</hi> First, Al the land of <hi>Judah</hi> was
over-run, and only <hi>Jerusalem</hi> left, where also was, as
commentatours tel us from the Scripture, a powerful,
&amp; numerous party divided from <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in a conspiracy
to deliver up the City to <hi>Sennacherib.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Hezehiah</hi>'s
mourning, and Humiliation was the breaking of the
Pitcher; <hi>Esaiah's</hi> prophecy, and message to him upon it,
which was ful of spirituality, of Evangelicalness, of
tryumph, which was, the <hi>Lamps</hi> shining forth upon the
breaking of the <hi>pitcher;</hi> the Comming down of the <hi>Angel,</hi>
by which the Army perished,, was the sounding of the
<hi>Trumpet,</hi> and the cry of the Sword of the Lord. Thirdly,
The Army was overthrown without a fight. Fourthly <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib</hi>
was slaine by his own Sons, as the <hi>Midianites</hi> set
every man his Sword against his fellow.</p>
            <p>In the 9. <hi>verse,</hi> the Reason of this wonderful Salvation
is given: <hi>For to us a Child is born, to us a Son is given &amp;c.</hi>
This in the letter is expounded of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> as he was a
figure of <hi>Christ.</hi> But the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves acknowledg
this whol Scripture to have a more sublime sense, and to
relate to the <hi>Messiah,</hi> which is Jesus Christ. We may
learn this from it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:100624:6"/>First, That al the eminent works, and wonders of
God in the world, by which he saves his people, or
executes vengeance on his enemies, are <hi>figures,</hi> and <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners</hi>
of the Day of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Some new birth and bringing forth of <hi>Christ</hi>
into the world in his own <hi>Person,</hi> or in his <hi>spirit,</hi> or in some
eminent <hi>Type,</hi> or <hi>Saint,</hi> or <hi>Dispensation,</hi> is the ground, on
which God builds his works of wonder in the world for
the good of his Church, or the Ruin of wicked men, and
powers.</p>
            <p>Having thus levelled the ground round about my
<hi>Text,</hi> I come to my <hi>Text</hi> it self, which compares the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of <hi>Sennacherib</hi> before <hi>Jerusalem</hi> with al warres by
way of transcendency. <hi>For every battel of the warrior is with
confused noyse, and garments rolled in Blood: but this shal be
with fire, and burning of Fuel.</hi> The difference between every
battail, and this slaughter of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> is three fold:
First, There are warriors on both sides: here <hi>Fire,</hi> and
<hi>Fuel</hi> meet. Secondly, There is a confused cry: here al
is in silence. Thirdly, There is a plentiful effusion of
blood: Here no blood is shed. An Angel went forth,
and smote of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> in one night one hundred,
fourscore, and five thousand: <hi>Esa.</hi> 37. 36.</p>
            <p>It is frequent in Scripture to set forth the Miraculous
Appearances, and Works of invisible Powers, either of
<hi>God,</hi> or of the <hi>Angels,</hi> or of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> by <hi>Fire,</hi> both
to the Ear, and to the Eye. A Pillar of Fire led the
Children of <hi>Israel</hi> through the Wilderness; Horses of
fire, and Chariots of fire, carried up <hi>Elijah</hi> into Heaven,
and encompassed the Servant of <hi>Elishah,</hi> when he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of an Army of Enemies; the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> descended
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100624:6"/>
in the form of fiery Tongues upon the <hi>Apostles.</hi> The
Lord promiseth by the Prophet <hi>Esaiah,</hi> to be a wall of
<hi>Fire</hi> round about his People. And <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> tells
us in the Gospel of St. <hi>Mathew,</hi> that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> shall
Baptize his People with the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and with
<hi>Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fire</hi> is the most potent, and glorious of all the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Some say, that the <hi>Sun,</hi> the chief, and the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Head of this visible World, is the Element of <hi>Fire;</hi>
and that <hi>Fire</hi> shal at last convert al the other Elements
into it self, and so give them their Perfection. <hi>Fire</hi> is
Burning, and consuming only on <hi>Earth,</hi> where it is strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened,
and meets with resistance. But in <hi>Heaven</hi> it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vital, transparent, shining, cheering, incorruptible. In
al these respects, how proper is it to represent the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
descents of God from above upon the Earth, as
he shines forth upon his Church, or flames forth upon
the world, by <hi>Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Doctrine</hi> which I shal observe to you from these
words, and insist upon, is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>DOCT.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>God makes it his Delight, and Praise, to go, New, and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
waies with his Church, and with the World for
his Churches sake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wil give you <hi>Two Arguments,</hi> for the cleering, and
proving of the <hi>Point:</hi> One from <hi>Christ:</hi> The other
from the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <div n="1" type="argument">
               <head>Arg. 1.</head>
               <p>The <hi>First Argument</hi> is taken from <hi>Christ. The way of God
with his Church, and with the World, in order to the Church, is in
Christ.</hi> I intreat you for the fuller understanding of this,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100624:7"/>
and how it makes to the Point in hand, to lay <hi>three Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
together. <hi>Ephes. 3. 8, 9, 10. Matth. 28. 8. Ephes.</hi>
1. 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 8. You read in the latter end of the verse, of
<hi>the unsearchable Riches of Christ. Two</hi> things go to make
up <hi>Riches: Preciousness,</hi> and <hi>Plenty.</hi> The things of <hi>Christ</hi>
are <hi>Rarities, Precious</hi> things; such, as are no where to be
found in the Creature. They are the <hi>Things of God,</hi> the
Righteousness of <hi>God,</hi> the Wisdom of <hi>God,</hi> the Power,
the Peace, the Grace, the Glory of <hi>God.</hi> Now <hi>Jesus Christ</hi>
hath <hi>Plenty</hi> of these <hi>Precious</hi> things, and this makes him
<hi>Rich.</hi> But the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> thinks not that word of <hi>Riches</hi>
enough to express the Excellency, and Fulness of <hi>Christ.</hi>
Therefore he adds to <hi>Riches, Vnsearchableness,</hi> and calls
them the <hi>Vnsearchable Riches of Christ. Vnsearchableness,</hi>
respects the <hi>Nature,</hi> or <hi>Number</hi> of things. The Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of <hi>Christ</hi> are <hi>both</hi> waies <hi>Vnsearchable.</hi> Every thing of
<hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>Vnvaluable:</hi> and those <hi>Vnvaluable</hi> things in Him,
are <hi>Innumerable.</hi> They are past our Understanding. We
cannot comprehend the <hi>Excellency,</hi> nor count the <hi>Number</hi>
of them. They swallow us up, and lose us in Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>At Verse 9. St. <hi>Paul</hi> goes on to shew, That the <hi>Mystery</hi>
of these Riches, in which al Saints, and Holy Spirits have
an immortal Fellowship one with another, as in a retired
<hi>Paradice,</hi> is that secret Wheel, hidden in God, on which
the whol Creation is turned from the beginning to the
End: <hi>And to make al men see, what is the fellowship of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
which from the beginning of the world is hidden in God,
who created al things by Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse, 10 We are taught, that the intent of God in
the <hi>Riches</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is, that the <hi>Angels</hi> themselvs, who rule
the whol world, as the Heads of al Created Beings,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100624:7"/>
Power, and Operations, even the highest of them, and
that in the midst of their Heavenly Glories, should have
new Discoveries of the Wisdom of God, in the variety
of its Wayes, and Contrivances by the workings of God,
<hi>according to Christ</hi> in the Church, and from the Church
upon the World: <hi>To the intent, That now unto the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities,
and Powers in Heavenly places may be known by the
Church the manifold wisdom of God:</hi> Verse 11. <hi>According to
the Eternal purpose, which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord.</hi>
The only Rule and Line, by which God walks and
works, is the eternal Draught or Platform in the Person
of <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us now lay to this Scripture, that of <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. 18.
<hi>All Power is given unto me in Heaven and Earth.</hi> They are the
words of our <hi>Savior,</hi> being risen from the dead. The
word <hi>Power,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Greek,</hi> signifieth <hi>Eminency, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
Magistracy, Rule. Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> have <hi>Four
Senses,</hi> which are all intended here. First, These <hi>Heavens</hi>
and <hi>Earth,</hi> which we see with our Eyes. Secondly,
Things <hi>Visible</hi> and <hi>Invisible.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Nature;</hi>
or the things of <hi>God,</hi> and of the <hi>Creature.</hi> Fourthly, The
<hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Common-wealth; Civil,</hi> and <hi>Religious</hi> Affairs, if
this be a distinct Sense from that before it. You see by
this <hi>Scripture,</hi> what use <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> hath for those <hi>Vnsear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable
Riches</hi> mentioned in the former <hi>Scripture,</hi> and to
what imployment he puts them; <hi>even</hi> to rule <hi>All</hi> in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
and in <hi>Earth;</hi> among <hi>Spirits, Angels,</hi> and <hi>Men;</hi> in
<hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Nature;</hi> in <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Common-wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I intreat you now to make a stand for a little while, and
to look back upon the joynt sense of these <hi>two Scriptures;</hi>
the <hi>Riches,</hi> and the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Christ;</hi> that we may see how
they make for our present purpose, for the opening, and
proving of our <hi>Point;</hi> that <hi>God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>lights to go new waies
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100624:8"/>
with his Church, and with the World;</hi> as also that we may be
affected with them in our own hearts. The Lord saith
in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> That <hi>a good man out of the good Treasury of his
heart, bringeth forth good things.</hi> We know, that if a man
speak, who is full, and hath much to say, he speaks
quick, passeth with a freshness from one thing to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and is still saying <hi>new</hi> things. What <hi>Rarities</hi> then,
what <hi>great,</hi> what <hi>new</hi> things may we expect every day in
the Affairs of the world for the Interest of the Church,
when as the <hi>Person</hi> who hath the Government of All, is
<hi>Hee,</hi> who hath in himself <hi>Vnsearchable Riches?</hi> What
Comforts is this to afflicted ones? what allurement to
sinners? what ground of Hope, and rejoycing to Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers?
what Light, and Direction to States-men? what
Humiliation in themselves, what Exaltation in <hi>Christ,</hi>
unto all? It is <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> who hath all Power in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
and <hi>Earth;</hi> in <hi>Spiritual, Civil,</hi> and <hi>Natural</hi> things;
who rules them all according to the <hi>Vnsearchable Riches,</hi>
which he hath in himself, of <hi>Mercy, Righteousness, Holiness,
Life, Joy, Glory, Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Power.</hi> Let every one now, that
is weary, and heavy laden with any burden of sin, guilt,
wrath, sickness, or sorrow, cry out; O the <hi>Preciousness</hi> of
the Love, and Vertue of <hi>Christ!</hi> how unvaluable are
they! O the Plentifulness of those Precious Loves, and
Vertues! how are they more for number, than the Sand
on the Sea-shore, or the Stars in Heaven! I will no more
look down upon the Darkness of mine own condition,
nor round about for Help or Happiness from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
I will wait upon him for visits every morning, for
influences every moment, upon my Soul, Body, Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Affairs; and those <hi>Great</hi> above my Understanding,
or Expectation, <hi>New</hi> without Number, or End.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:100624:8"/>
                  <hi>There is a</hi> third Scripture, <hi>which concurrs so fully
with these</hi> Two <hi>mentioned before, which so comprehends
the sence of them both, which gives so much light, and
strength to our present buisness, that I may not omit it.</hi>
Ephes. 1. <hi>verse,</hi> 20, 21, 22. Which he wrought in Christ, when
he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in
heavenly places, Farr above al principality, and power, and
every name, that is named, not only in this world, but in that,
which is to come, And hath put al things under his feet, and
gave him to be the head over al things to the Church.</p>
               <p>Pray observe some few short Particulars, which lye
faire in the very outside of the words. First, The Lord
<hi>Jesus</hi> stands not now in any Root of Nature, but upon a
supernatural Root in the Resurrection from the dead
by the Almighty power of the Father. Secondly, He is
not in the Capacity of his Humane, but of his divine
Nature. He is at the <hi>Right Hand</hi> of God, that is, in the
Love, strength, Joy, Glory of the God-head. As the
<hi>Left Hand</hi> of God is his wrath, his strange work, his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise:
so his <hi>Right Hand</hi> is Love, his naked Face, his
proper form, where he is seen, as he is, as the Saints shal
behold him. Thirdly, He is not rank't in any order of
the Creatures. He is set above al ranks, and orders of
Created things, both men, and Angels with their sever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
dignitys, and degrees: <hi>Farr above principalitys and powers.</hi>
Fourthly, He is cloath'd with an Image, a form, which
hath no Proportion, Similitude, or Agreement with any
thing of the Creature. <hi>He hath a Name above every Name,
that is Named in this world, and that, which is to come.</hi> The
Name of <hi>Christ,</hi> which is the Image of his Nature, is not
only above Sun, Moon, and Starres with al the powers
of these Visible Heavens, and Living men upon the
Earth: but also above the Angelical world in its freshest
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100624:9"/>
glory, as it is that world, which is next to be unvailed,
and come forth upon the stage before the Eyes of men,
when the Saints shal be, as the Angels of God. Fifthly,
<hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> as his Person is thus stated, and in this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity;
is made the <hi>Head over al things,</hi> to contrive, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
work al every where, as the Head doth in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
which is the seat of the understanding, the fountaine
of sence, and Motion. Sixthly, Al this is in order to the
<hi>Church,</hi> for the Churches sake <hi>He is given to be head over all to
the Church;</hi> that the Propriety, the pleasure, the Profite in
his Person, Power, and Rule might be the Churches.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Miracle</hi> is defined to be that, which is <hi>Supra ordinem
totius naturae creatae,</hi> Above <hi>the order of al Created Nature.</hi>
What new, what strange things, what Miracles may we
look for now in the government of the world, especially,
when the Church is concerned: seeing that our Lord
<hi>Jesus</hi> in this Capacity, as he is at the Right hand of God,
set above al Rankes, and orders of the whol Creation,
is made Head over al things for the Church? <hi>Jesus Christ</hi>
could work no Miracles in one place, because of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe
of the Inhabitants. Our unbeliefe, in that we
see not the Lord Jesus, as <hi>Esaiah</hi> saw him by a Spirit of
Prophesie, fitting upon this Throne of the divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
high and lifted up, above every Principality, and
Power, is the Reason, why we have no more Miracles,
no more of his new, and extraordinary Works in the
midst of us. It is our unbeleefe, that we do not see, and
acknowledg, those wonders, which he hath wrought, and
is stil working, while he fils the whol earth with his glory
from his Throne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John, 6. 57. Jesus</hi> saith. <hi>He, that eats me shal Live by me,
even, as I live by the Father. Revel.</hi> 10. 9. 11. The Angel
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100624:9"/>
give St. <hi>John</hi> a Book to Eate, and then tells him, that <hi>he
must prophesie before many peoples, and Nations, and Tongues, and Kings.</hi> If we did eate this spiritual, and Heavenly
Person of <hi>Christ,</hi> which is the <hi>Book</hi> of Life, that <hi>Word</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
forth from the mouth of God, on which alone man
Lives; If we did by faith, in the vnity of the spirit, take
in, concoct, digest, turn into Nature, and Nourishment
these Evangelical truths concerning the <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>
above al, given to his Church; the <hi>Headship</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> over
al, for his Church: how certainly then, and how spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
should we be fed with Honey from the Rock? we
should live in our own Persons, in our private, publike
Capacitys upon a constant, dayly Stream of <hi>Miracles</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
down from the Father; we should draw down, and
carry forth waters of life from the depth of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
before the Kings of the Earth, and into the midst
of the Nations. Thus much for the <hi>First Argument</hi> taken
from <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="argument">
               <head>Arg. 2.</head>
               <p>The <hi>Second Argument</hi> is drawn from the <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi>
As the way of God is in <hi>Christ</hi> having his <hi>New name</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
upon his Person: so the Way of <hi>Christ</hi> in his Church,
and in the world for his Church, is in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and after
the <hi>Newness</hi> of that.</p>
               <p>Rom 7. 6. <hi>But now we are delivered from the Law that being
dead, wherein we were held, that we should serve in Newness of
spirit, and not in the oldness of the Letter.</hi> The Soul of man is
here set forth, as having two Husbands. The first Husband
is the First <hi>Adam,</hi> the Flesh, the Natural Man. This
being slaine by the death of the Lord <hi>Jesus;</hi> the Soul is
set free from him, and from his Law, which is a Law of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100624:10"/>
sin, and Death. Her second Husband, to whom she is
married upon the Death of the first, is the last man, the
Glorified Person of Christ, as He is in the Resurrection
from the Dead. And now the Soul is subject only to
the Law of this Husband, which is the Law of Free
Grace, of Love, raigning by Righteousness, which is
the Beavty in the Face of the God-head, unto Eternal
Life, through Jesus Christ, by Vertue of our Marriage-union
with him; the Love, Righteousness, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
of God the Father letting it self forth upon his
Person first, then in, and through him upon us, unto
our Justification, Sanctification, and Glory. <hi>That we
should serve.</hi> As to <hi>Fear God</hi> in the old Testament, and to
<hi>beleeve</hi> in the new: so in both to <hi>serve</hi> him comprehends
al parts of Religion, the whol Communion between
God, and the Soul; by which God Ministers himself in
streams of Truth, Grace, and joy to the Soul; or the
Soul Ministers to him, by recejving him, by recejving
al from him, by receiving him together with al, and by
returning it self, and al things to him, in Love, humility,
obedience, thanksgiving.</p>
               <p>The <hi>two</hi> ways of this Service are the <hi>Oldness of the Letter,
and the newness of Spirit.</hi> The Letter is that Law, which is
proper, and fitted to the Principle of Nature, the flesh,
the first <hi>Adam</hi> in his power, and purity. The <hi>Spirit</hi> is the
Law of the New man, the Heavenly Image, and second
<hi>Adam,</hi> as He is risen from the dead, and stands in a Root
of Glory, from thence blossoming, and bringing forth
fruit in al his Members. The Letter is like unto a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern.
The Spirit is the Fountain. The water in a Cestern
hath its stint, and set measure; it is a standing water,
which hath no spring to quicken it, it is apt to corrupt
with standing, and to dry away. Such is the Law of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100624:10"/>
                  <hi>Letter.</hi> It is shut up in an outward, narrow form, and
measure; it hath not its root in it self; it grows old, it
darkens, withers, and dies away. But the <hi>Spirit</hi> is a
Fountain, and as a Fountain hath a <hi>Five-fold Newness;</hi> of
<hi>Life,</hi> of <hi>Lustre,</hi> of <hi>Purity,</hi> of <hi>Variety,</hi> of <hi>Immortality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here now, although it may seem to be a digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
from my present scope, yet give me leave by the
way to interpose a <hi>Caution</hi> very proper for this discourse
of the Letter, and the Spirit; which is, that you mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
not the Ryot, Excess, and Inordinacy of the flesh,
for the Newness, Freedom, aud Extraordinariness of the
Spirit. To assist you in this <hi>Caution,</hi> take this <hi>Distinction</hi>
between the Novelties, and Extravagancies of the flesh;
and the Newness, and Extraordinariness of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>First: There is a Newness in which there is somthing
unchangable, an inward Principle, a hidden Nature, a
Life, a Rellish, which is ever the same; however, the
outward operations and manifestations vary. The Life
of the Spirit is as a Tree. The Tree is new in the Spring,
the Summer, the Autumn; having for every Season, its
fresh puttings forth of Leaves, Blossoms, Fruit, ripe Fruit.
Yet the Tree is still the same, hath the same Root, Sap,
and Nature.</p>
               <p>Secondly: There is a Newness, where all things are
changed, not only the outward puttings forth, but the
most inward Principle, where there abides nothing of
the savor. This is like that change, where the Rod of
<hi>Moses</hi> being cast upon the ground, was made a real Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and the Dust of <hi>Egypt</hi> being cast up into the Air, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
living Lice.</p>
               <p>Now, as they say in Phylosophy, <hi>Species, et Essentiae re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
sunt sempiternae, et immobiles: The Essences, and Kinds of
things, are ever the same;</hi> however, there be an Infinitness
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100624:11"/>
of uncertainty, and change in the <hi>Individuals,</hi> by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety,
and change of outward Accidents: So in a Saint
compared with himself through the whol time of his
Regeneracy, or compared with all other Saints in all
Ages, ther is the same new nature, the same inward saver
in the Principle, in the Spirit, although the inward forms
upon the understanding, may have great change accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the different degrees, and wayes of Light; as
also the outward forms of life and Conversation, may
have great variety in answer to the Light within. But
where you see Persons, while they profess themselves
to be Saints, changing all, having nothing of the same
Nature, or Rellish left; there is great reason to fear,
that this is not the Newness of the Spirit, but the Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Flesh; not the freshness, and variety of the
living Spring, but the Endless turnings, and windings
of the old Serpent.</p>
               <p>But to return now, and to shew you how this <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
which hath occasioned this short stay by the way,
makes good that <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which we have in hand. All
the way of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in the Saints, and in the World
for the sake of the Saints, is after the newness of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
It follows then, that it must be it self New, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another</hi> Scripture <hi>compared with this, wil make the</hi>
Proof <hi>from both more strong, and cleer.</hi> Es. 43. 18, 19,
20, 21. Remember ye not the former things, neither consider
ye the things of Old. Behold I will do a new thing: now it shall
spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in
the Wilderness, and Rivers in the Desart. The Beast of the field
shall honor me, the Dragons, and the Owls, because I give Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in the Wilderness, and Rivers in the Desart, to give drink
to my People, my Chosen. This People have I formed for my self,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100624:11"/>
they shall shew forth my praise. <hi>There are</hi> Four Things <hi>to be
taken notice of in these words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First: The Deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> from the <hi>Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
is the proper subject of this Prophesie in the Letter
of it, as you shal see at verse 4. This Deliverance from
the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> is made in <hi>Scripture</hi> universally a Type of
every Deliverance of the People of God from the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Darkness, and of this world; but more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the Deliverance of the Church in the last daies
from <hi>Antichrist,</hi> which is Spiritual <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly: In this Deliverance, the Lord laies aside
all Presidents, every old Form, and Custom; he works
a <hi>New</hi> thing. What is this <hi>New</hi> thing? <hi>He makes a Way in
the Wilderness; and Rivers in the Desart.</hi> These Expressions
look backward by way of Allusion to the Coming of the
Children of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> when the Lord made a
way for them through the Wilderness, going himself
before them in the Pillar of a Cloud, and of Fire, and
gave them Rivers of Water from the Rock, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
them in the Desert. But this Literal Sense is not
that which the Lord here intends. For this had been no
New thing, but had only brought the former things to
remembrance by the Imitation, and Re-iteration of
them. Therefore the words look forward to an Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical,
and Mystical accomplishment in the times of the
Gospel. We all know, that <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> is frequently
held forth in the Gospel, as <hi>the Way. John,</hi> 14. 6. He cals
himself, <hi>The Way. Heb.</hi> 10. 20. He is said to be <hi>the New,
and Living Way,</hi> by the rending of the Vail of his Flesh,
and the raising of him up again in the Spirit. In like
manner it is an Evident thing, that the Spirit of <hi>Christ</hi>
in the Gospel, is resembled to <hi>Rivers of Water,</hi> as <hi>John,</hi> 7.
38. <hi>Out of his Belly shall flow Rivers of Living Water,</hi> ver. 39.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100624:12"/>
                  <hi>This spake he of the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This then is the <hi>New</hi> thing, which the Lord doth. He
turns the outward face of things in Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
into a Wilderness, puts al into Confusion,
that no humane Eye can see any way, either forward, or
backward. Then he comes forth with new, extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
appearances in <hi>Christ;</hi> as the Pillar of a Cloud bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
all the Light and Life of the Creature in the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of <hi>Christs</hi> Death; as a Pillar of Fire, shining, and
sparkling forth with a New Light, and Heat, from the
Glory of his Resurrection. These Extraordinary Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
in <hi>Christ</hi> the Lord makes his way, in which he
walks, and into which he leads his People to walk with
him in his wonders through the Churches, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>When the Spirit of man becomes a Desert, like a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-brook,
that is passed away, and decives the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the weary Traveller; all Springs of Wisdom,
Counsel, Help, Comfort in the Creature, are dryed up:
then the Lord comes forth in mighty and miraculous
workings after the Newness of the Spirit, in the fresh
flowings of that, and makes it to be, as Rivers in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert.
Rivers have these Properties: First, They are
from a Living Spiring: Secondly, They flow along with
a great breadth, depth, and force: Thirdly, They flow
continually, running along still with a fresh succession of
New waters from the Head of the River: Fourthly,
They make all things cheerful, and flourishing round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bont
them. So doth the Lord in the Desert of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
put forth himself by his Spirit with an irresistable
force, an uncessant Newness, with a quickness of life, a
breadth and depth of design, from the immediate Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the God-head.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:100624:12"/>Thirdly, It is observable here, that the Saints are
they, who peculiarly drink of these Rivers. They have
the immediate inward sence, Strength, Joy, Glory,
the cheif ends, and benefit of these <hi>Out-goings</hi> of the
God-head. But natural men signified by <hi>the Beasts of the
field,</hi> the powers of this world; yea the most ignorant,
and unbeleeving, that sit in the greatest darkness, which
are, as the <hi>Owles;</hi> Nay more, than that, the <hi>Dragons,</hi> the
profanenest, and wickedest persons both Princes, and
Stats, who have the greatest enmity to <hi>Christ,</hi> and his
Church; al these shal acknowledg, and give glory to
the Lord in these Miraculous workings of his from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
partly for the greatness of the Conviction by the
presence and cleerness of the Appearances of God in the
midst of them, before their Eyes; as is signified, verse,
19. <hi>Now it shal spring forth, shal ye not see it?</hi> partly for
the relife, and the refreshing, which shal be extended
to them also in their natural Man, and civil affayres.
For so it is said; verse, 20. <hi>They shal honor me, because
I give waters in the wilderness &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The end of al this is for the Saints; that they
may be formed, and wrought up to God, to Spirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Heavenlyness, to his Likness, to one Image, and
Nature with him, to the Immediate enjoyment of him,
to his Bosom, his Throne; there to raigne with him;
from thence as chosen Vessels to carry forth the Praises
of God in the Gospel, of his Love, his Righteousness,
his Holyness, his Beauties, his Joys, his Glorys, into the
Nations, that the Saints may be as a Holy first-fruits, and
the Nations, as a sanctified Lump through them. <hi>This
people have I formed for myself, to shew forth my praise.</hi> Verse,
21. I have now finished the <hi>two Arguments</hi> for the making
good of the Doctrine; one taken from the Person,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100624:13"/>
and Office of <hi>Christ;</hi> the other from the Influences, and
Operations of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> as both <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi>
are in the Newness of the highest, and most Evangelical
Glory; as both stand in relation first to the Church, then
to the world for the Churches sake. I come now to the.

               <head>Use, 1.</head>
               <p>The <hi>first Vse</hi> is of <hi>Thankfulness.</hi> God makes it his delight
and praise to go new, and extraordinary waies with his
Church, and with the world in order to his Church. Let
us then raise our delights, and his praises from the sense
of those new, and extraordinary paths, in which the
Lord hath walked forth before our Eyes in the midst of
al the nations round about us for our sake. That the
<hi>Newness</hi> of the divine footsteps in our dais, and in our
Land may leave the deeper print upon our spirits; let us
consider it in these <hi>Six Particulars. 1. Our Changes:</hi>
2. <hi>The Quickness of our changes. 3. The Freshness upon our
Changes. 4. The inward Life, whence our Changes spring.</hi>
5. <hi>The Seal upon our Changes from their Living Principle. 6. The
Spirit of Grace evidencing it self, as the Principle, and the
Seal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, <hi>The Changes,</hi> Which have been upon us, shew the
<hi>Newness</hi> of the Lords way with us. <hi>Jerem</hi> 48. 11. The Lord
complains. Moab, <hi>hath been at ease from his youth, and he
hath setled on his Lees, and he hath not been emptyed from Vessel
to Vessel: therefore his tast remained in him, and his sent is not
changed.</hi> How often hath <hi>England</hi> been changed from
Peace to Warr, from one Warr to another, from one
form of Government to another, from Extremities to
Enlargements, from Enlargements to Extremities again?
These <hi>Changes</hi> have been, as so many Vessels, out of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100624:13"/>
which, and into which we have been emptyed. Are
we stil upon the Lees of Carnality, and Corruption? If
we discern not God in a new Glory; if we discern not
<hi>Jesus Christ</hi> with his new name; if we discern not the
Newness of the Operations of the Spirit in al these
things; then doth our Earthly tast hitherto remain, and
our fleshly sent is not changed. O for a refinedness of
Soul now from the Lees of Earth to a pure wine of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality!
O for a heavenly tast, a heavenly sent! How
should we rellish this feast of new delicacys, which the
Lord sets forth for us? How should we love <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> for
the Savor of his new, and good Oyntments; in which he
powrs forth himself into the midst of us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. 12. We reade of the <hi>Sun</hi> turning <hi>black, as
Sack Cloath of Hair; the</hi> Moon, <hi>as blood.</hi> vers. 13. <hi>Stars of
Heaven fel unto the Earth, even as a Fig-tree casteth her untimely
Figs being shaken by a mighty winde</hi> Verse, 14. <hi>Heaven
departed, as a Scroule, rolled together. Verse,</hi> 16. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of al this, <hi>i. e. The Face of him, that sits on the Throne, and the
wrath of the Lamb.</hi> Many times over in this our little world
of these divided Islands we have seen, the <hi>Sun</hi> of our
Religious Formes, our Church-state becomming black,
as a Sack-Cloath of Hair, which is a mourning weed; the
<hi>Moon</hi> of our Civil affayres, as Blood, Nay al Blood: we
have seen the <hi>Heaven</hi> of the Supream power pass away,
as a scrol of Parchment roled up, and laid by; our Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Persons, which were, as <hi>Stars</hi> in the Heaven of
that Power, shining with a Lustre, and ruling with an
Influence of universal Authority, yet on a soden falling
from this Heaven to the Earth of a common rank, and
obscure condition. Do we not thorow al this perceive
the Face of God sitting upon his Throne among us, a
Throne of most exalted Grace, and loving kindness to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100624:14"/>
his people, but of the most exalted vengeance, and wrath
to his enemy? observe those two things, <hi>the Face,</hi> and
the Face of God <hi>sitting upon the Throne.</hi> What unvailings
of new, and extraordinary glorys do these Expressions
speak forth? Are not these the Seal, to which these
Nations, as Wax are turned, and changed? Blessed are
they, that stand within these Wheels, to be carryed a
long by them, and move together with them. Over
others, who see them not, these Wheels pass, and break
them to pieces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joel.</hi> 2. 30. The Lord saith; <hi>I wil shew wonders in the
Heavens and in the Earth, Blood, and Fire, and pillars of smoake.</hi>
Verse, 31. <hi>The Sun shal be turned into darkness, and the</hi>
Moon <hi>into blood before the great, and terrible day of the Lord
come.</hi> There are <hi>three daies</hi> of the <hi>Lords comming:</hi> First,
<hi>To a Particular Nation:</hi> Secondly, <hi>At his Incarnation:</hi>
Thirdly, <hi>To the last Judgment.</hi> Al these are Capable of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this <hi>Scripture</hi> applyed to them, especially where the
<hi>first</hi> of these daies, the <hi>Comming of Christ to a Nation</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
after the <hi>Second</hi> day of his <hi>Incarnation,</hi> and borders
upon the <hi>Third day</hi> of his <hi>last comming.</hi> This Scripture
hath been litterally fulfilled in our times, in our land.
What frequent Eclypses of Sun, and <hi>Moon</hi> have we seen?
What Comets? Concussions, and Prodigyes in al the
Elements, Earth-quakes, Tydes changing their Courses,
Meteors of al sorts in the Ayre, Devouring Fires? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
the Earth, the Air, the Waters, the Fire, the
Heavens see the Lord, and are troubled; shal his Saints
be insensible of him? shal not they shout, and say: This
is the day, which no Created, or usual light, but
the Lord hath made by his shinings forth; It is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in our Eyes, beyond the whol Course of Nature;
we wil rejoyce, and he glad in it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The Quickness of our Changes.</hi> This is the <hi>Second</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:100624:14"/>
thing, that argues the <hi>Newness</hi> of Gods way with us. I
intreate you here to compare 2 <hi>Scriptures; Hagg.</hi> 2. 6.
<hi>For thus saith the Lord of hosts, Yet once it is a little while, and
I wil shake the Heavens, and the Earth, and the Sea, and the
dry land,</hi> verse, 7. <hi>And I wil shake al Nations, and the desire
of al the Nations sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l come, and I wil fil this House with glory,
saith the Lord of hosts.</hi> Hebr. 12. 26. <hi>Whose voyce then shook
the Earth: but he hath promised saying; Yet once more I shake
not the Earth only, but also the Heaven:</hi> Verse, 27. <hi>And this
word, yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that
are made, that those things, which cannot be shaken, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi>
The comparing of these <hi>two Texts</hi> affords us
these Particular Observations: First, This word, <hi>Once,</hi>
signifies one continued act of shaking unto an universal,
and Total Change. Secondly, That which maks this
shaking is the Newness of <hi>Christs</hi> comming forth in the
unchangable Glory of his Father, and of the Spirit. For,
the Prophet <hi>Haggi</hi> seeming to speak of the first comming
of <hi>Christ</hi> in the flesh, to fil that present Temple, which
was then building, with the Glory of his Doctrine, and
Miracles, is by the Author of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
interpreted of the comming of <hi>Christ</hi> in Glory, as being
the truth, and the end, to which the other comming
was only a Type, and a Preparation. So also, that which
the <hi>Prophet</hi> calls. The <hi>Desire of the Nations;</hi> is in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi>
called, <hi>Those things, which cannot be shaken,</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to <hi>things, that are made, and to be taken away.</hi> Both
together cleerly describe <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in the <hi>Newness</hi> of a
Heavenly Glory, which can never fade. It is before
this <hi>Newness</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> at it secretly beames forth into the
Creation, that Old things shake, and fal away. Thirdly,
<hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> comes first in his Desirablenesses, to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
to those among the Nations, who desire him. This
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100624:15"/>
seemes to be signified by that expression: <hi>The desire of al
Nations shal come.</hi> He shal come under that formality, as
the <hi>Desire</hi> of the Nations. The Saints in every Nation
stand for the whol Nation in the esteem of God, they
being the Corn in the heap, the rest of the nation, as the
Chaffe. <hi>Esa.</hi> 43. 4. The Lord saith to his people: <hi>Since
thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honorable, and I
have Loved thee: therefore wil I give men for thee, and people
for thy life,</hi> or as it is in the Margin, <hi>for thy person.</hi> Those
whom the Lord loves in a Nation, are the only Figures
there; the rest are Cyphers, which signifie nothing of
themselves. <hi>James.</hi> 1. 14. The Children of God are said
to be a <hi>Kind of first fruites of his Creatures.</hi> So are they the
<hi>first fruits</hi> of every Nation. As the <hi>first fruits</hi> were presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to God every year at the Tabernacle, or Temple by
the hands of the Preist in the stead of the whol Lump: so
the beleevers are presented to God in the spirit by Jesus
Christ, as filling up the place of the whol Nation.</p>
               <p>Upon this account, when the prophet hath said: <hi>The
desire of al Nations shal come;</hi> he adds; <hi>He shal fil this House
with his Glory.</hi> Under the Gospel, and in the spiritual
truth, which answers the Judaical Tipe, the Saints are
the House of God. 1 <hi>Corin. 3. 16. Know ye not, that ye are
the Temple of God?</hi> When the Lord comes to work his
wonders in the world, he first comes into his Church, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the spirits of his Saints, fills them with that spiritual
Glory shining from his own person, which is the sign of
his outward commings forth, before he comes; and the
inside of them, when he is come. From hence, as from
his Temple, he shines forth by degrees upon the world;
from these, as the first fruites; he sends forth a blessing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100624:15"/>
to the whol Lump of the Creatures. Fourthly, When
these shakings begin to break forth from the Spirits of
the Saints into the World, they are swift, and spreading.
<hi>Yet a little while: And I wil once more shake Heaven, and Earth.</hi>
As when a stone fals into the Water, the Circles in the
Water made round about it, do in a moment Multiply,
and as they Multiply, grow wider each than other: So
when Jesus Christ comes with the Newness of a spiritual
Glory into his House, which is the heart of a Saint; from
thence he spreads himself in the newness of his Power,
and mighty works over the Nation round about; from
thence enlargeth himself in a wider Circle to the Neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Nations; so he goes on, til he ouerspreade with
his Changes not the Earth only, but also the Heavens;
and al this in a very little space, as fire catcheth, or the
lightning flyeth.</p>
               <p>Now let us look home. Our Changes, since the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of these times, have truely been so quick, and
thick; that they may wel appear one continued shaking.
You then in this Nation whose Souls love the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
is <hi>your Desire</hi> come? while others as Cyphers, do
bear the empty shadow of the outward work in these
new, and Extraordinary Motions; is his presence, his
person, his operation precious, and of great value to you?
Doth he fil you, who are his house, with the freshness
of his light, and Glory; while others stand without, at
a distance, seeing a throng of changes, and wonders;
but know not, what is the matter? Where then are your
cryes of Joy? The voyce of our beloved! Behold, he
comes, leaping over the Hils, passing with swift changes
over the powers of this world; he comes <hi>consuming</hi> al
old things, the old Heaven and Earth with the heat of
his presence; but <hi>changing</hi> his own and al things unto
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100624:16"/>
them into the newness, and Immortality of the Spirit;
making them new, together with a New Heaven, and a
New Earth round about them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The freshness of our Changes.</hi> Prov. 25. 4, 5.
<hi>Take away the dross from the Silver, there shall come forth a Vessel
for the finer. Take away the wicked from the King, and his
Throne shal be established in Righteousness.</hi> The former of
these verses is an Allegory explained in the latter. Both
have a Mystical sense pertayning to every Saint; and
Typical concerning Jesus Christ. Take away the Dross
of Corruption out of the Heart from the Silver of
Grace; and the Saint wil be a King in the Spirit upon a
Throne of Glory founded on the Righteousness of God,
and his Spirit in Jesus Christ; this King wil be a pure
Silver Vessel for God the finer to set on his table, and fil
with the Treasure of his Divinity. Take away the dross
of Corruption from the Silver of the Divine Image in
the Creature; then wil the whol Creation be a Vessel of
honor for the Father to fil with his Wine; then wil
it be a Throne founded on the Eternal Rock, on which
Jesus Christ shal sit down, as a King. This extends it
self to Nations, and Priuciples also. Let us take a view
of our selves in the Glass of this Truth.</p>
               <p>If we look to the great Parliament from the beginning
of it: was there not a Silver there, a precious Mettal of
excellent principles, and Eminent persons? But this
Silver was mingled with the Dross of much Carnality,
and Corruption. Hath not every change since that time
been, as a fire, to take away the Dross from the Silver?
Hath not every succeeding form of things when it hath
come first out of the fire of the fore-going Change, bin
as a Vessel for the finer, with a greater Preciousness,
Purity, Beauty, Lustre, Life, and usefulness unto God?
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100624:16"/>
How then is that day of the Lord risen upon us, which
is to try al things? How should our mouths be filled with
laughter, and praises for this <hi>New</hi> thing, which God
doth, this <hi>New</hi> day, which God bringeth forth from
Heaven? Say now to Hypocrites; Woe to you. But say
to the Righteouss, It shal be wel with you. For the
Beams of this day are a Manifesting light, a Refining fire
to al: but they are withal to the Saints a covering gloy,
and a Cherishing Love. Our King is come forth into our
Land, not only to march through it with his troupes;
but to establish his throne here in Righteonsness, and
to sit down upon it. O Dross, Dross, melt away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the presence of the Lord. For his Eyes are a flame
of fire. They are stil Kindling fresh Furnaces of
Change.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Life in these Changes from which they flow.
Rom.</hi> 12. 11. you have the knot of a three-fold Precept
held forth: <hi>Not slothful in business, fervent in spirit, serving
the Lord.</hi> This is likewise a Divine Character upon the
<hi>Newness</hi> of extraordinary Times, Works, and Persons.
When the Lord hath any fresh, and peculiar piece of
work, in which he is to be served, he fils men with a
strange unwonted vigor in his business, to contrive, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
and execute wonderful things. To this end, as
a man puts fire under a pot, so he sends forth his Spirit
after a new manner into their Hearts, that they boyl, and
run over; they are no more in their own power, they
can no longer contain themselves. Such a Description
as this, <hi>David</hi> makes of himself, <hi>Psal. 39. 1. I said I will
take heed to my wayes that I sin not with my tongue; I will keep
my mouth as with a Bridle, while the wicked are in presence: I
was dumb with silence, I held my peace from good, my sorrow
was stirred: My heart was hot within me, while I was musing,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100624:17"/>
the fire burned; then spake I with my tongue. David,</hi> and
<hi>Christ</hi> in him, were opprest by wicked men. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
to suffer in silence, and to suppress all Motions
towards the outward advancement of Goodness. At
length the Word of the Lord comes to him, first it warms
his heart, by degrees it grows hotter, while he museth
upon it, is irresolute, unwilling to come forth openly
upon the Stage; it becomes a fire, it breaks forth, burns
out like a mighty and irresistable flame.</p>
               <p>You have an Example like to this in St. <hi>Paul;</hi> Acts, 20.
22. <hi>And behold now I go bound in the Spirit unto Jerusalem, &amp;c.</hi>
God had a new, and great work for St <hi>Paul</hi> to do, to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
to the Gospel of <hi>Christ,</hi> by preaching, and by suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings;
at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> the chief City of the Jews; at <hi>Rome</hi>
the Head City of the World, before Rulers and Princes.
And now though afflictions, and death were Manifestly
before his Eyes in this journey; though friends, Saints,
Prophets, his own heart lay Weeping, Bleeding Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in his way, to stop him from going on in that
course, from whence he should returne no more; as ye
may see, verse, 23. 25. 27, 28. Chapter, 21. verse, 4.
11, 12, 13. Yet he shuts his Ears, and his Eyes to al
these, treads them under his feet: goes over them al.
Would you know the reason <hi>He was bound in Spirit.</hi> An
extraordinary power of the Spirit came upon him,
bound<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> up al his facultys in its heavenly chaines, and
carryed him Captive to its Divin Force, and Wil.</p>
               <p>There are many witnesses, that the like unto this
hath been heard, known, and felt often in our daies,
and affaires. Supernatural <hi>Impressions,</hi> Divine and Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistible
<hi>Impulsions,</hi> as gales of wind from Heavem, have
filled the Spirits, affections, counsels, and actions of men,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100624:17"/>
like sails, by which the ship of this Common-wealth hath
bin carryed on from port to port, from change to change.
When the two disciples wer going to Emaus, &amp; <hi>Jesus Christ</hi>
in the midst of them; they said; <hi>did not our hearts burn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
us, while he talked with us?</hi> but their Eyes were held
that they could not know him. If <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> have
been in the midst of us, as a fire; if he have made the
hearts of his Servants to burn within them, yea, to flame
forth, to lick up all the water of opposition, to consume
all the Damps of Discouragement, that have been cast
upon this fire, from their own reason, reputation, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
purposes, former principles within; from diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
dangers, disswasions of friends, combinations of
of Enemies without: Shal our Eyes stil be held that we
should not know him, who is thus a burning, and shining
Light among us? or shal our spirits be held from rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
and dancing in this Light, while its season la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth?</p>
               <p>Fiftly: <hi>The Inward Principle of Life being the Seal upon our
Outward Changes.</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 16. <hi>Nevertheless the Foundation
of the Lord standeth sure, having this Seal; the Lord knoweth
who are his. And let every one that nameth the Name of Christ,
depart from iniquity.</hi> This word, <hi>Nevertheless,</hi> implies a
tacite <hi>Objection</hi> arising from the foregoing words of the
Apostle, verse 17, 18. <hi>Hymeneus and Philetus</hi> of eminent
Beleevers, and Preachers of the Gospel, were become
<hi>Hereticks,</hi> whose words did spread, and kil like a <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene;</hi>
insomuch that they had <hi>overthrown the saith of
some.</hi> Now might a poor Saint say; <hi>Good God!</hi> what
way is there to attain to a sound and saving Faith, which
cannot be overthrown? or when shal I know that my
Faith is thus sound, and saving? Who can be sure of
their Faith, that it shal not fail them, when it hath failed
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100624:18"/>
these? The Apostle gives <hi>two Answers</hi> to this <hi>Objection:</hi>
First, <hi>The Foundation of the Lord standeth sure.</hi> God the
Father of our Lord Jesus, makes himself in the hearts of
his Children, to be a sure Foundation unto their Faith,
so that it can never be shaken. This Foundation he lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the fair colors of his own Spirit, of a mystical, and
peculiar Union in the Spirit, of an especial work of Grace
flowing from this Union. Secondly, This <hi>sure Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
at the bottom of our hearts, and faith, is also the Seal
of Assurance upon them both: <hi>Having this Seal, the
Lord knoweth who are his.</hi> In Spiritual things, that
which is the Life, is the only Light, which is therefore
so called in the Gospel; <hi>the Light of Life;</hi> the <hi>Principle</hi>
is the <hi>Seal; Ye mere sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise,</hi>
faith St. <hi>Paul, Ephes.</hi> 1. That Light of Knowledg which
is <hi>Originally</hi> the Knowledg of the Lord in us, that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municatively,</hi>
by Vertue of the Union, is our Knowledg,
and this Knowledg is our <hi>Seal.</hi> As in Natural things the
Eye sees not alone, neither doth the Soul; but both
concur in every act of sight. So is it in every act of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Sence; <hi>The Spirit of the Lord witnesseth together with
our Spirits,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8. The Spirit of the
Lord, and our Spirit, like the <hi>Soul</hi> and the <hi>Eye,</hi> joyntly
concur in every act of Spiritual Knowledg. The Lord
knoweth in us, we know in the Lord that we are his.
Thus this Union, which is the <hi>Principle of Life</hi> in us, is in
like manner the <hi>Seal of Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The world hath often objected to the servants of the
Lord in the great Works of our times: You plead in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Principles, Power, and Light, for your Justification
in extraordinary waies; that it is from the fervency of
your spirit in the Service of the Lord; and of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100624:18"/>
welfare: How shal we know this, that you do not
Cloath contrary designes, and corrupt interests with
these pretences? how can we, or you tel that your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
are not delusions?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What hath the answer been? Hath it not been, that
of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> to the Jews, when they refused to mourne
to his weeping, or to dance to his Musick: <hi>Wisdom is
justified of her Children, Matth.</hi> The Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> as he
is by his spirit the <hi>Power</hi> of God in us; from which we act
and on which we stand, as on a <hi>sure Foundation.</hi> So is he
in like manner the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God in us, by which we
know him, and his out-goings, by which we are also
known of him, and owned by him. This is our <hi>Seal.</hi> As
many, as have fellowship with us in the same principle
of divine Wisom, wil according to the measure of it, so
farr, as they are free from carnal prejudices, and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to exercise this <hi>Principle,</hi> know, and own this <hi>Seal.</hi>
The Manifestations of God are in the <hi>Flesh;</hi> but the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
of those Manifestations is in the <hi>Spirit.</hi> And
this is that, which makes, the whol way of Godliness a
<hi>Mystery: 1 Tim.</hi> 3. 16.</p>
               <p>But now it is necessary to interpose <hi>two Cautions</hi> for the
removing of <hi>two Objections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object. 1.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Principle seems to make the Light of <hi>Reason</hi> use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
even in Civil things; and to lay aside in Humane
Affairs the common Principles of <hi>Natural</hi> Light, by
which we should converse with men, as men, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
our selves to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object. 2.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This makes a Gap in the Hedg of all Civil Government
for Licenciousness; and Confusion to break in; when
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100624:19"/>
every man may alike pretend to an <hi>Inward</hi> Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>I intreat you therefore to keep your selves close to
these <hi>Cautions,</hi> which I shal now add for the cleering of
this matter from these Aspersions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caut. 1.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the duty of every person in every Affair, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for things honest, not only in the sight of God, but
in the sight of all <hi>men.</hi> This is a Principle and Law in
Christianity: <hi>Rom 12. 19. Provide for things honest in the
sight of all men: Honest,</hi> or <hi>Beautiful</hi> and <hi>Comely;</hi> for so
the word signifies; <hi>in the sight of all men;</hi> that is, in that
<hi>Light of Nature,</hi> which shines universally in al men. The
Natural Light in the Conscience, and Understanding of
Man, is a <hi>Picture</hi> of the Spiritual Light, which is the <hi>Life.
Reason</hi> is a Shadowy Figure of <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> Now as the
<hi>Life,</hi> and the <hi>Picture,</hi> if it be true, answer one another;
and that which is beautiful in the one, will be so in the
other too: so the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> mutually give their
testimony each to other; what is comely in the eye of
one, is so to both.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> prayes, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 3. to be delivered from <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
men; for al men have not Faith.</hi> It is true that
those, who are not <hi>Spiritual,</hi> are also <hi>unreasonable,</hi> the
wordis <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Absurd,</hi> uncapable of any common place
of <hi>Reason,</hi> any common Principles of <hi>Natural light.</hi> In
another place. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 15. The same <hi>Apostle</hi> tels us, that
<hi>to those, who are defiled, and unbeleeving al thing are impure,
even their minds, and consciences are defiled.</hi> As a Poet cals
the light of the <hi>Moon,</hi> when she is Ecclypsed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposal
of the Earth between the Sun, and her, that
his beams cannot flow freely, and purely unto her, <hi>Lucem
Malignam, a Malignant light:</hi> so is it in men meerly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100624:19"/>
the prince of darkness and a principle of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
inwardly; the world with carnal interests, and
Humors outwardly, put in between the Face of God,
the Fountaine of al light, and their Souls, to the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of such an <hi>Eclypse,</hi> that the light of their <hi>Minds,</hi> the
highest, and purest part of their spirits, the lights of
their <hi>Consciences,</hi> the divinest part of their <hi>Minds,</hi> like
the tops of the Mountaine which receive the beams of
the Sun neerest, first, and fairest; the light of <hi>both</hi> these
is <hi>defiled,</hi> and become <hi>Malignant.</hi> Upon this account,
they either are unable to judg a right of that Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
which the light of <hi>Nature</hi> inwardly gives, or else
unwilling outwardly to acknowledg this inward Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;
but do falsify, corrupt, deny it according to
their fleshly lusts, and ends. They only for the most part,
in most affaires, can understand, and submit to the light
of <hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> especially there, where <hi>Jesus Christ</hi>
comes forth in <hi>new,</hi> and extraordinary waies upon the
Face of <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> things; who have the <hi>Spirit</hi> in
them loosing their <hi>Reason,</hi> which <hi>Satan</hi> hath bowed down
for so many years, like the Woman in the Gospel.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithstanding al this, a Christian is in every thing
to follow after, whatsoever is praise-worthy, of good
report, comely, with God, and with men, in that,
which is the <hi>true light</hi> of men, and <hi>right Reason.</hi> So, if
their <hi>Minds</hi> be not altogether reprobate, and their <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi>
seared, if there be any spark of <hi>Natural</hi> light left
alive in them, you shal approve your selves to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
and minds of men inwardly; although they
outwardly speak evil of you. As the <hi>Historian</hi> says of the
<hi>Romans</hi> concerning that excellent Person, their deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<hi>Camillus; simul oderant, et Mirati sunt:</hi> they wil <hi>admire</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caut 2. Let every one, that nams the name of Christ, depart
from iniquity.</hi> Whoever pleads a <hi>Spiritual</hi> life, and light
for the <hi>Principle,</hi> and <hi>Seal</hi> of his actions, ought to beware
that he sow not divers seeds in this field, that he mingle
not <hi>Fleshly</hi> designes with <hi>Spiritual</hi> discoverys. <hi>Cursed be he,
that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully.</hi> If you undertake
the worke of the Lord to do your own work the better;
If you make a shew of the work of the Lord, or make
use of the work of the Lord so farr, to cover, and to
bring forth the works of the Flesh: there lies a curse up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you. The Name of the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> is like the water
of <hi>Jealousie,</hi> which the suspected woman was to drink.
If thou cal the name of the Lord <hi>Christ,</hi> and of his spirit
to witness falsly, while thou art unchast, and untrue to
thy spiritual principles, and ends; while thou knowest
thy spirit to have plaid the harlot, and to live in unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with this present world: this <hi>Name</hi> wil, like that
<hi>Drink,</hi> make thy belly to Swel, and thy Bowels to rot
within thee; it wil certainly bring thee to destruction
with shame, and abhorrency.</p>
               <p>He that sets upon <hi>Extraordinary</hi> things upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of an <hi>Extraordinary Principle, Seal,</hi> hath one of these
<hi>two</hi> things to rely upon; First, A <hi>Divine Power</hi> in an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistable
way to subdue the spirits, and Forces of men to
him: Secondly, or else a <hi>Divine Presence</hi> in an unexpressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sweetness to support him, when he shal suffer in the
thoughts of men, or at the Barr of <hi>Ordinary</hi> powers. How
watchful ought we to be in affayres of so high a nature,
or consequence, that neither <hi>Hypocricy,</hi> nor <hi>Delusion</hi> shut
the Door to these Confidences in us?</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>The spirit of Grace, the principle, and Seal of these
Changes.</hi> This is the last Argument of the <hi>Newness</hi> and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100624:20"/>
                  <hi>Extraordinariness</hi> of the way of the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> in the midst
of us. There are <hi>five Marks</hi> of the <hi>Spirit of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, <hi>The Spirit of Grace is a Spirit of Prayer.</hi> Zach. 12.
9, 10. <hi>And it shal come to pass in that day, that I wil seek to
destroy al the Nations, that come against Jerusalem: And I wil
poure upon the House of</hi> David, <hi>and upon the Inhabitants of
Jerusalem a Spirit of Grace, and Supplication. Two</hi> things
are observable here: First, It is an <hi>Argument,</hi> that the
Lord hath a designe by himself to destroy the enemies of
his people, when he pours out a <hi>Spirit of Grace</hi> upon his
people. Secondly, He alwaies, and more especially,
when he is seeking the ruine of his enemies, joynes these
<hi>two,</hi> a <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> and of <hi>Supplication.</hi> Are there not
many, that can testifie by their own experience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the works of these times; that the Heart of God,
in a <hi>Spirit of Grace</hi> hath bin let down into the Bosom of
his beloved ones; that thus their hearts have bin by a
<hi>Spirit</hi> of Supplication drawn up into the Bosom of God,
and have drawn forth these deliverances from the <hi>Wells
of Salvation</hi> there? These <hi>Wells</hi> are Deep, the Deep
things of God, his Love, his Wisdom, his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
his power, his Glory, as these lie in the very depths
of his Essence, and Divine Nature. But Saints have had
their <hi>Buckets,</hi> their <hi>Hearts,</hi> to draw with; and a <hi>line,</hi> a
<hi>Spirit of Supplication,</hi> long, and sure enough to let down
their hearts into these deep Wels of Salvation, which
are in the Heart of God. These <hi>Wells</hi> are stil ful of living
Waters; and these <hi>Buckets</hi> are stil going. Saints keep
your expectiations stil fresh.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The spirit of Grace is a spirit of Prophecy. Esai.</hi>
43. 9. God challengeth al the Nations: <hi>Let them bring
forth their witnesses, who among them can shew us former things?</hi>
that is, things before they come to pass, or, things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100624:21"/>
their times, before the world, by a spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie.
Verse, 12. <hi>I have declared, and have saved, and
I have shewed, when there was no strange God among you: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God.</hi> Hath
not the Lord many <hi>Witnesses</hi> in these Nations, yea, here
present? I know, he hath. In the former daies, when
ye were with him at your Banquets of spiritual enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
on your Bed of spiritual Loves; then did he by
his spirit before hand signifie within you the snfferings of
these times, and the Glory, which hath risen out of them.
And as he hath declared, so hath he saved us, by the
<hi>same Spirit.</hi> And now tel me, ye that are the Lords wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses;
when ye are in your holyest seasons, when there
is no strange God, or Love, but <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> alone shines
in the midst of your spirit; doth he not stil shew you
<hi>greater things, than these,</hi> which are yet to come?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The spirit of Grace is a spirit of Holiness. Ephes. 1.
13. <hi>It is called a</hi> Holy spirit. Ye were sealed with the Holy
spirit of Promise. Holiness <hi>is the Character, and Seal of that
spirit of Grace, which is promised to the Saints.</hi> Psal. 99.
8. Thou answeredst them, O Lord our God; thou wert a God
that forgavest them, though thou takest Vengeance of their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.
<hi>The</hi> Lord <hi>testified his presence with the</hi> Jews <hi>in
the Wilderness by his</hi> Holiness, in taking Vengeance of their
Inventions.</p>
               <p>There is a <hi>Three fold Vengance,</hi> which the <hi>Lord</hi> takes for
Sin. First, On the <hi>Persons,</hi> and this <hi>three waies:</hi> 1. By
Casting them off for ever: 2. By Cutting of the inward
Beams of spiritual Communion between himself, and
them for a season, perhaps for al their life long. 3. By
Clouding their outward Man with trouble, and sorrow.
God alwaies pardons iniquity to the <hi>Persons</hi> of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in respect to the first of these <hi>Vengances;</hi> He cannot
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100624:21"/>
give them over or cease to love them: sometimes also in
respect to the second, and third. He continues the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their Communion with him, and the Serenity of
their natural comforts un-interrupted. Secondly, The
<hi>Second Vengance</hi> for sin is on the <hi>publike Cause.</hi> Thus the
<hi>Lord</hi> did forgive the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the Wilderness, and not
take Vengeance on the <hi>publike Cause.</hi> For though they
al died in the desert, yet the Lord kept his cause a live,
carryed that Victoriously over <hi>Jordan</hi> into the Land of
<hi>Canaan,</hi> and planted it to grow there for many generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
The <hi>Third Vengance</hi> on the <hi>Inventions,</hi> on the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and Idols of the Heart. In this sense the <hi>Lord</hi>
never pardons any.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spirit,</hi> which hath bin our guide, hath <hi>Signally</hi>
declared it self a <hi>Spirit of Grace</hi> by its abundant <hi>Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi>
and a <hi>Spirit of Holiness</hi> by the <hi>Vengance,</hi> which it
hath taken for Sin. When any have risen up against <hi>him,</hi>
his <hi>Purity,</hi> his <hi>Progress,</hi> from the Enmity of the Serpent;
he hath made the <hi>Earth</hi> to open, and swallow them up
into the darknesses below by a <hi>Natural,</hi> or <hi>Civil</hi> Death:
he hath made <hi>fire</hi> to come down from Heaven, a spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual
fire of Divine judgement, and wrath, by which they
have bin so withered, dryed, and burnt up; that they
have lost al that Greenness of <hi>Religion, Honor, Honesty,
Morality, Natural light,</hi> which they seemed before
to have; and have fallen to open <hi>Perfidiousness,</hi> to
ranting <hi>Profanenesses,</hi> to a <hi>reprobate Sense,</hi> a stupid <hi>Atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calness.</hi>
But, when the Children of the Kingdom have
transgressed by temptations of Covetousness, Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Fleshliness, Passion, Delusions, Spiritual Pride,
have fallen to Murmurings, Divisions, Sensuality,
Worldly Designs: although this <hi>Spirit</hi> may have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
all this to their <hi>Persons,</hi> hiding them in the cleft
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100624:22"/>
of the Rock, in the wounds of <hi>Christ,</hi> there preserving
their <hi>Outward,</hi> their <hi>Inward</hi> Life, and Peace, while he
hath passed by: yet hath he taken open <hi>Vengeance</hi> of
their <hi>Inventions,</hi> by manifest, eminent Disappointments
in their Expectations, and endless confusions in the way
of their Designs. Yet all this while hath the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi>
pardoned the sins of all Parties to the <hi>Cause.</hi> He hath
not suffered that to fall, but hath gone on when it seems
to faint, renewing its strength, carrying it up on high, as
on an Eagles wing, enlarging it in Victory, Peace, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Liberties at home; spreading its Branches over the
Seas, and to Forraign, far distant Lands; breaking the
Head of the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> the chief strength of <hi>Antichrist</hi> in
the deep Waters.</p>
               <p>Fourthly: <hi>The Spirit of Grace is a Spirit of Vnity.</hi> Ephel.
4. 3. <hi>Endeavoring to keep the Vnity of the Spirit in the bond of
Peace. Vnity</hi> is the Character, the most immediate and
inseparable Property of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> The <hi>Bond of Peace</hi>
hath its strength, and root in the <hi>Vnity of the Spirit:</hi> as
the <hi>Sympathy</hi> and <hi>Vnion</hi> of all the Fellow members in the
Body arise from, and is preserved by <hi>One Soul,</hi> by the <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is a</hi> Twofold Vnity. <hi>First, of</hi> Inward Affection.
<hi>Secondly, of</hi> Outward Effect. <hi>As to the</hi> Latter <hi>of these, I
had rather much speak in silent Groans to God, than by
words to men; bleed inwardly, than breath forth out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Complaints for the Breaches of the Daughter of
my People. But so far, as concerns the</hi> First <hi>of these,
the</hi> Inward Affection <hi>to</hi> Vnity, <hi>let me call forth you, who
have the Testimony in your selves, that it hath been the
Spirit in the</hi> Living Creatures <hi>in the Hearts of the Saints,
quickened by the Life of</hi> Christ, <hi>which hath been in the</hi>
Wheels, <hi>that have turned about, and carried on this whol
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100624:22"/>
work from the beginning hitherto; I appeal to you.</hi>
What are the Meltings, the Weepings over the Divisions among the
Saints? What Yearnings, and turnings of Bowels after a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union?
Do you not in the secret of your hearts, in your secret Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
bleed forth your souls before the feet of your Savior, at every
breach in his Body; as at a Wound, or the Cutting off of some
Member in your own Body? As <hi>Jacob</hi> lamented over the loss of
his Children: <hi>Joseph</hi> is not, <hi>Simeon</hi> is taken away from me, you
would have <hi>Benjamin</hi> also; all these things are against me: So you
mourn; such Brethren left us at such a change; these Saints are not
with us in this change; and there are others ready to divide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from us at the next turn of affairs: al these things are against
us. As the spirit of God spreads it self over the deep of darkness at the
beginning of the Creation, like a Bird over her naked yong ones, till
they be hatcht up, and fledged, to form it to a beautiful, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
World, Light and Order: Do you not after the same
manner perceive the Spirit of Vnity on your souls stretch forth it
self over all your fellow Members, that lie in a Chaos, in a Deep of
Darkness, Division, and Confusion? As Iesus Christ once wept
forth these Words over <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> As a Hen gathereth her
Chickens under her wings; How often would I have gathered
thee, but thou would'st not? So he weeps, so he speaks the same
words in your Souls to all his divided Brethren in these Nations:
as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her wing; how long have I
called and waited, and longed to gather you up into the Vnity of my
Spirit, that you might not by your scatterings become a prey to the
Kite? but hitherto you will not. Joseph when he thought fit to
speak roughly, and deal severely with his Brethren; with much
difficulty concealed his affections, was forced to make hast into a
private room to weep. Hath this been your temper, when the
wisdom of State, or the season hath made it seem necessary to you to
handle any one of Christs Flock roughly? have your Bowels been
turned within you? hath it been hard, and grievous to you to act
this strange part, and to hide your affections? have you inwardly,
and privately melted into tears while you have openly thundered
out hard speeches? Do you not much more contend with God by
Spiritual Wrastlings to have the hearts of all his People, that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from you; than you do by outward force, or policy, with them,
to have the upper hand of them?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:100624:23"/>If these things be thus, go on, and prosper. When
<hi>Esau</hi> came with an Army against <hi>Jacob</hi> his Brother, <hi>Jacob</hi>
wrastled with God, at <hi>Penuel,</hi> which signifies the <hi>Face,</hi> or
<hi>Vision of God,</hi> he conquered his Brother the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
way, <hi>like a Prince,</hi> in conquering God, and carrying
away a Blessing by Conquest. <hi>Esau,</hi> when he met him,
instead of drawing his Sword upon <hi>Jacob,</hi> embraced him,
and offers him those Bands for his Guard, which came
forth Enemies. Could one <hi>Jacob</hi> thus subdue the Heart
of rough <hi>Esau?</hi> and shal not <hi>many Jacobs</hi> by their strong
cries in the Ears of God, and tears in his Bosom, prevail
with God for a Victory of Love over the Hearts of <hi>many
Jacobs,</hi> only disguised, and concealed under the rough
hairy Garments of <hi>Esau?</hi> Yes, the hour is coming, in
which you shall come forth hand in hand in Spiritual
Dances, and answer one another with Spiritual Songs,
saying; <hi>These our Brethren were lost, but now are they found
in our arms: These Brethren were dead one to another, but now
behold they live together in the Vnity of the Spirit.</hi> As <hi>Joseph,</hi>
and his Brethren; so shal you after long Concealments
be discovered one to another, in a Light of Heavenly
Love; then shal ye fal one upon anothers Necks, and
weep for joy; then shal you say, <hi>We meant evil, but it
was the Lords contrivance, who hath turned all to good.</hi> Thus
shal ye receive one another into the Glory of God, as
<hi>Christ</hi> hath received you.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, <hi>The Spirit of Grace</hi> is a spirit of love to <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
It makes his person alone, and the Glory of that to be
the <hi>Mark,</hi> and <hi>Price</hi> of our calling: <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 14. As water
wil ascend as high, as it first descends: so the spirite,
which is often compared to water, is like water in this,
if it come down from <hi>Christ,</hi> it wil carry the ayme, and
affections of the soul to <hi>Christ.</hi> That which is the first
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100624:23"/>
Principle, is the last end. If it be Jesus Christ, who hath
been the first principle of motion in our hearts, he wil
be our only End, we shal terminate, and rest no where,
but in him. When <hi>Jacob</hi> had served an Apprentice-ship
of seven years for the Love of beautiful <hi>Rachel,</hi> he was
marryed by <hi>Laban</hi> to bleare-eyed <hi>Leah.</hi> Did this satissie
<hi>Jacob?</hi> No, He chose to endure the hardship of another
service for seven years more, to suffer the heats by day,
and frosts by night in the open fields, that he might gain
his first Love. If it were a Conjugal Love to the person
of <hi>Christ,</hi> which moved us to undertake, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
the hard service of so many years in difficulty, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
in a field of warre, Blood, and Death: we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
now lie down, and take up our rest in the Embraces
of the blear-eyed Beavty of this World, though it be
given to us in marriage, and be exceedingly fruitful to
us. No, We shal begin another service of as many years
more in prayers, in conflicts, in sufferings of al sorts, til
he, whom our Souls love, come, and give his own
person into our Armes. As the <hi>Spouse</hi> in the <hi>Canticles;
Cant.</hi> 3, 4. We shal never cease, til we hold his glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
person in our Marriage-Embraces, never to let him
go more, until we bring him into our Mothers house,
into this visible World, to make al things new, and to
raigne here as he doth in Heaven. It is not this that a
Saint seeks thorow Seas of water and Blood, to rob the
Nations of their Gold, but to communicate to them this
God. It is not this, which is his joy, and tryumph, to
see his enemys drowned in the Floods: but to let in the
Rivers of <hi>Christs</hi> blood upon them to over flow them,
and that they may die the Death of Christ only.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Alexander</hi> drew neer to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
Army, he was met by the High Priest in all his
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100624:24"/>
Ornaments, his Garment, his Girdle, his Ephod, his
Urim, and Thummim, of Gold, Silk, Sky-color, Purple,
White, all sorts of precious Stones, with the most Holy
Crown upon his Head, which was the Figure of the
Glory of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> at the right hand of the Father in
Heaven, as he is our true High Priest. <hi>Alexander</hi> seeing
him, said; In this very form did that God appear to me
in a Dream by night in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> who commanded me
to pass over into <hi>Asia,</hi> and undertake this War. Upon
this account he used the Jews with all Kindness and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.
My end in bringing in this Story, is to make this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of it: If we have had any glimpses in our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of our dear Savior in the Heavenly Beauty and Glory
of his Person; if we have been carryed on to this Work
by his Spiritual Appearances, and Power in us: then wil
not our work be at an end, til we see him shining forth
in the ful Glory of his Person and Spirit, not upon us
only, but upon the whol Earth. The Vow of <hi>Christ</hi> is
upon us, not to give sleep to our Eyes, til we have found
a setled Habitation for our Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> as he is cloathed
with al his Spiritual Glories, in our own hearts, and with
men. I have done now with the last <hi>Evidence</hi> of the
Presence of our God with us in the <hi>New way</hi> of his <hi>Son,</hi>
and <hi>Spirit;</hi> which <hi>Evidence</hi> is this, That the <hi>Spirit of
Grace</hi> hath been the <hi>Principle,</hi> and <hi>Seal</hi> of these great
Works and Changes in the midst of us. The <hi>Vse</hi> that I
would make of it, is to enlarge us in our Praises, that
we may now see, and say with joy; The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> goes
up on high in our Land, he carries Captivity captive,
he gives Gifts to men, even to the rebellious, that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
may dwel among them. I have done with the <hi>First
Vse.</hi>

               <head>Vse 2. A Caution to beware of four things.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caut. 1. Limit not God.</hi> This was the sin of the <hi>Jews</hi>
in the Wilderness: <hi>They limited the Holy One of Israel,</hi> Psal.
7. 41. Princes love not to be prescribed, much less
doth God. <hi>To what will ye liken God, and to what likeness wil
ye compare him?</hi> Es. 40. 18. If the Lord be doing <hi>Great</hi>
things among us, according to the Exaltation of <hi>Christ,</hi>
if he doing <hi>New</hi> things according to his own <hi>Spirit;</hi>
what measure will ye take, what President wil ye make,
what likeness wil ye frame of his Way, by things past, or
present?</p>
               <p>Take heed of <hi>Two</hi> Wayes of <hi>Limiting</hi> God.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Shut not the Lord up into any Form, or way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</hi>
The <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> complains of the <hi>Jews,</hi> Psal. 78. 19.
<hi>They spake against God, they said, Can God furnish a Table in
the Wilderness?</hi> Let us take heed, that the Language of
our hearts and actions be not like to this, that we say not;
If we have no set Form, no Establisht way of Religion,
or Civil Government, Can God in the Wilderness, and
Confusion of such a Condition, continue, or encrease
Truth, Holiness, Prosperity, and Peace? Thus to limit
God, is to speak against him.</p>
               <p>Secondly: <hi>Shut not God out of any Form, or Way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</hi>
I speak here of the Lords Working in Love, not
Wrath: and accordingly of those Forms, and Waies,
out of which he hath not excluded his Love, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
between them, and his Divine, Holy Nature.
<hi>Nathaniel</hi> himself had like to have stumbled at <hi>Christ</hi> by
his narrow-sightedness in this kind. <hi>Can</hi> (said he) <hi>any
good come out of</hi> Nazareth? <hi>John,</hi> 1. 46. Yet, as <hi>Chrysostom</hi>
tels us, <hi>Nazareth</hi> signifies a <hi>flower, Christ</hi> out of <hi>Nazareth,</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:100624:25"/>
was <hi>Flos è Flore,</hi> a <hi>Flower out of a Flower.</hi> That form, or
way which seems to thee most uncapable of having any
good in it may be made by God a Sweet, and flourishing
flower, out of which another more glorious flower may
spring, even Jesus Christ in the spiritual, Civil, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Image of things. This is the <hi>first Caution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Caut. 2. <hi>Murmure not against the</hi> Lord. <hi>When Jesus
Christ</hi> had sent this marke of his being come to <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist;</hi>
That, <hi>To the poor the Gospel was preached,</hi> or as some
read it, and the <hi>Greek</hi> ful, as wel, bears it, <hi>The poor
preach the Gospel,</hi> he ads, <hi>and blessed is he, that is not offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at me; Matt.</hi> 11. 5, 6. How apt are men to murmure
against, to stumble at, to reject <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> himself, even
then, when he comes with glad tydings, with peace, and
glory from the Father in the Gospel, if the way, by
which he conveighes these things to them, answer not
their imagination, and expectation, but be in any
kind poor, obscure, and dis-esteemed. There are
<hi>two Cases,</hi> in which we are apt to be ensnared in this
kind.</p>
               <p>First, The <hi>Jews</hi> had setled their expectation of the
<hi>Messiah</hi> upon the Pompe, and Power of an outward King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
He comes with his cross instead of a Throne.
They therefore are offended at him, reject, and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
him. So men generally fix the accomplishment of
promises, the answer of prayers, the works of God, the
administration of Christ, the operations of the Spirit in
Religion, and Civil things, upon some way, that is
fairest in their fancyes, or understandings. If God come
not to bless them, and to save them in this way, but by
some other <hi>Person,</hi> or <hi>Thing,</hi> which is without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
in their Eye, they murmur and refuse him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:100624:25"/>Secondly, When the Soldiers had our faviour in their
hands, they put a Crown of Thornes upon his head, a
Reed for a Scepter into his hand, a purple robe upon his
back, then they mock him, and spit in his Face. I
humbly pray, that this spirit be not powerful in us, who
profess our selves Saints, and peace-makers, that we
do not after the same manner, when the Lord makes any
person, or way, which we have a low esteem of, to be
the instrument of his power, Majesty, and love, cloath
it with the most contemtuous disguises of Hypocrisie,
delusion, Ambition, Licentiousness, falshood, Atheisme,
and then spit in the Face of it, persecute it with al bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness,
and scorne under this Disguise.</p>
               <p>Cant. 3. <hi>Judg not things by the outward apperance, but
by the inward principle. Solomon</hi> saith: <hi>Al the waies of a man
are clean in his own eyes: but the Lord weigheth the spirit:
Prov.</hi> 16. 2. I have heard of a blind man, who could
distinguish, and judg of al mettals or precious stones by
weighing them in his hand. Thus judg alwaies, not by
the beauty of the outward forme, but by the weight of
the inward pinciple.</p>
               <p>It was a Starr in the Region of the Ayre above the
Earth, that led the wise men to the House, where <hi>Christ</hi>
was borne. So should it be the light of a principle in
the spirit above the outward form, by which we
should be gvided in our esteem, affections, and pursuits.</p>
               <p>Cant. 4. <hi>Judg every principle in the Light of the Holy
Spirit. Psal. 73. 16, 17. Asaph</hi> professeth that it was
too painful for him to understand things in this world by
their outward Appearances, until he went into the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
of God, then he understood the end, by discov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the principle, or beginning. Before this he was
<hi>Foolish, and Ignorant, as a beast,</hi> vers. 22. The Sanctuary
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100624:26"/>
was a Figure of our <hi>Savior</hi> in his <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agur</hi> Complaines, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 2, 3. That, <hi>He was
more brutish, than any man; and had not the understanding of a
man.</hi> He gives the reason of this, because, <hi>He had not
learned Wisdom,</hi> which is the Knowledge and judgment of
things in their inward principles, and he was without
this wisdom for want of the <hi>Knowledge of the Holy.</hi> This
expression of, <hi>the Holy,</hi> in Scripture signifies Glorified
Natures in Heaven somtimes, whether Angels, or Saints,
somtimes Saints on Earth, Whatever it be, the <hi>Knowledg
of the Holy,</hi> is that alone, which comes by the <hi>Infusion,</hi>
and <hi>Illumination</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> Cant. 1, 2, 3. <hi>For
the Savour of thy good Oyntments,</hi> saith the <hi>Spouse</hi> to <hi>Christ,
thy name is, as an Oyntment powered forth. Therefore do the
Virgins love thee. Draw us, and we wil run after thee.</hi> The
spirit of <hi>Christ</hi> in the brightness, and sweetness of its
light, Purity, Love, Joy, is this <hi>Oyntment powered</hi> forth.
No Savour is good to a <hi>Virgin-Spirit,</hi> but that alone of
these Oyntments. Where there is a <hi>Virgin love</hi> to <hi>Jesus
Christ,</hi> the Soul is drawn, to run after any excellency,
only by this Savor, by the light, and sweetness of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
as this Oyntment is poured forth there.</p>
               <p>As it is in the Objects of sight, there is the <hi>Material</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and the <hi>Formal.</hi> The <hi>Material</hi> is the thing seen,
as a flower, a Picture. The <hi>Formal</hi> is the colors, by
which it is seen. Besides these is the <hi>Light</hi> in the Ayre,
which actuates these colors, and makes them to appear.
So is it in things pertayning to the understanding, and
Judgment. The outward appearance is but the <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riality</hi>
of the <hi>Object,</hi> the shinings forth of the inward
principle is the <hi>Formality,</hi> the <hi>Color.</hi> But the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi>
is the only <hi>Light,</hi> by which the discoverys of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of things are drawn forth, and laid open. I have
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100624:26"/>
done now with the <hi>Second Vse,</hi> and come to the <hi>Third.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse,</hi> 2. This is for <hi>Exhortation.</hi> If God go forth in <hi>New</hi>
waies, let us be <hi>New,</hi> that we may be fit to meet him,
and go along with him. We read in the <hi>Gospel</hi> of the
Pool of <hi>Bethesda. John,</hi> 3. 2. An Angel at certain times
came down into this Pool, and troubling the waters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
a healing vertue into them. Many sick persons
lay round about the Pool ready to step in. There was
also a House to receive the poor, diseased waiters. This
House was called <hi>Bethesda,</hi> which signifies the <hi>House of
Free Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You who have the blackest Guilt, the deepest brand
of any Lust, the darkest despair upon your Spirits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
here a way for you to be made new this very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The Blood of <hi>Christ</hi> is before you, as a <hi>Healing,</hi>
and <hi>Clensing Pool.</hi> Your <hi>Savior</hi> himself is every moment
descending into it from Heaven, and ascending out of
it to Heaven, by the Vertue of his Death, Resurrection,
and Ascention, to impart the Efficacy of al these to it,
himself to take you into his bosom in the midst of these
Waters, to bath you throughly in them till you become
quite new; then to carry you up with himself into the
Newness of the Spirit, of Heaven, and of the Glory of the
Father. But perhaps you wil say; you are so sick, so
dead in sin, that you cannot move toward this <hi>Healing
Pool.</hi> Let not that discourage you, the Father himself is
ready to take hold of you, and by his strength to put you
in. He <hi>draws</hi> us to <hi>Christ.</hi> It may be you wil say, that
you are under the Wrath of the Father, and therefore
cannot hope, that he should give you his helping hand.
To answer this, he hath built a <hi>House of free Grace, a Bethes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da;</hi>
he hath called this Pool of most precious Blood, the
<hi>Pool of Bethesda,</hi> the <hi>Pool of free Grace.</hi> The Doors of this
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100624:27"/>
House stand continually open, day and night. All Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are invited, and press'd to come in. All, whom the
Father finds here, he himself takes, and carries in his
own Arms to this Pool, and laies them in the Arms of his
Son, who is alwaies descending into it, waiting in the
midst of it, and rejoycing exceedingly, when any sinful,
sick Soul comes thither to him. Open your Eyes, and
see Oye Sons and Daughters of Men. Here, now, in this
place, at this very hour, is the House of free Grace, the
Healing Pool before you, if you will enter into them.
Nay, even here, and now, you are already in the house of
Free Grace, and in the Arms of the Father; you are in
this healing Poole of your Saviors blood, you are in your
Saviors Armes, he is come down to you, he is carrying
you up with himself thither, where al things are <hi>New,</hi>
your being, Beauty, Life, company, delights new;
if only you wil beleeve, if only you wil open the Eye of
your spirit to see the truth, as it is in <hi>Jesus.</hi> The Lord
<hi>Jesus</hi> is set down upon the Throne of Grace, and fils the
whol Earth with the Glory of his Mediation. Only the
Eyes of men are held, that they see not this Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse,</hi> 4. This is my <hi>last Vse,</hi> which is for <hi>Consolation,</hi> and
Encoragement. You have now a warr with the most
potent Prince in the whol Christian world, who is Cheif
staff of the Papal, Anti-Christian strength. You have
reason to expect a Combination of al the powers of
darkness, and this world, Visible, and Invisible, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,

like other warrs, but after a <hi>new</hi> manner. It shal be

               <p>Take notice here for your Comfort, that this <hi>Fire</hi>
shal have contrary effects upon the Saints, and upon their
enemys.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:100624:27"/>First, This <hi>Fire</hi> upon your enemys shal have these <hi>Propertys;</hi>
It shal be; First, <hi>Dreadful,</hi> Secondly, <hi>Irresistible,</hi> Thirdly,
<hi>Devouring,</hi> Fourthly, <hi>Tormenting,</hi> Fiftly, <hi>Sodeine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, This <hi>Fire</hi> to its friends shal have these <hi>Property.</hi>
It shal be: First, <hi>Cherishing,</hi> Secondly, <hi>Enlightning</hi> Thirdly,

<hi>Vniting,</hi> melting the Gold, til it al run into one undivided
mass</p>
               <p>I shal conclude this use, and my Sermon with an allusion to the
story of <hi>Eliah,</hi> who sat upon the top of Mount <hi>Carmel,</hi> when the
Captaines, and their fiftys in the name of the King commanded the
man of God to come down. But he answered; if I be a man of
God let fire come down from Heaven, and destroy you with your
fiftys. <hi>Carmel</hi> signifies the <hi>Vineyard of God.</hi> This <hi>top of Mount
Carmel</hi> is the Church in the spirit of glory, in the glorified person
of Christ her head, where she is as a flourishing Vineyard to God
upon the top of a Mount of spirituality. Let Kings with their
Armys encompass us, if we be men of God, the seed of God, if this
be <hi>Mount Carmel,</hi> on the top of which we stand, the cause of
God, the Church, the spirit, the Mediation of Christ: then shal
the Holy Angels, the spirit, Christ himself, come down, as Fire
from Heaven, upon our enemys to consume them, but upon us to
carry us up on high, as in the Charriot of <hi>Eliah,</hi> burning with the
Love, and Glory of God.</p>
