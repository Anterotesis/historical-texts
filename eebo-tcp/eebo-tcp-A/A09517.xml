            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Not hath it bin the least of my care to cast an especiall eye uppon the seuerall victories, &amp; vnparaleld deliuerances (if wee take up all circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) which this state hath bin honored with. In the compasse of three yeares or there about, I haue seene strange turnings &amp; returnings of prouidence, ebbs of State that left vs (at least the wise-hearted) hopelesse of a flood: and then agayne high waters, that haue left many thoughtesse yea carelesse, of an ebb: heere haue I seene an enemy slighted at a great distance, &amp; too much feared neerer hand, many mountainous designes which haue prooued mole hills in execution, heere haue wee seene men looking one way &amp; the Lord bringing the thing about another, sometimes God destraining for his glory where men would not giue it him other wayes: In a word heere hath bin imploiments for all kinds of spirits, all kinds of men, heere the sad heart hath had matter to feed those black vapors that cherish melancholy, &amp; heere the freer spirit might h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Truly (S<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>) wee haue seene much of Gods faythful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse &amp; sufficiency, &amp; wee ar to bee blamed if wee have not also seene our owne inability &amp; nothingnesse.</p>
            <p>But whiles I haue let my meditations travel from one place to another they haue lodged longer in these two, viz: first in the consideration of our selues 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi> of the enemy: in the former whereof wee may take up matter of wonder, that the Lord continues vs instruments of his glory, &amp; the subiect of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

&amp; bounty, who may iustly take shame to our selues that wee ar no more sanctified in our drawing neare unto him, or doe sanctifie him soe little: alas (S<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>) strangers that looke uppon us may thinke that wee are his onely iewell, since wee are kept so safely: but the truth is our beauty is but black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, our deformities are the speech of neighbor nations, &amp; by the openesse of our folly wee make the daughters of the Philistims reioyce. Nor haue wee lesse worke in the contemplation of the enimy, being the center to which subtilty, cruelty, dilligence in euell, with many other the like, as so many lines haue their confluxe. What great cost haue they byn at in the not yet subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a handfull of people nay (which is admirable) that which hath bin the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> mon breake-back to other states &amp; countryes, hath bin the supplying of their treasures heere, &amp; filling of their Magazins, I meane their Army.

Heere I will not treate, I haue formerly advertisd about them: what mertie the Lord hath sent them from the sea, &amp; what siluer trophees from the enimy hath bin brought, is not now my purpose to speake: But since the Lord by an especiall hand led me to looke vppon the beginning &amp; end of this late deliuerance, I shall aduertise therein according to truth, in which I may not seeme (it may bee) soe particular as some may expect, because I dare not call Opinion, Fayth: nor so exact in tearmes, because a stranger to the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage though a freind to Souldiery: but this I shall doe, I will labor to shew truth in her nakednesse, or at least in her owne apparell; and the order I shall propose will bee this; First I shall present the bare history 2,<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> some obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from it, 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> I shall add some vses wee may make of it: and first for the history.</p>
            <p>Whilst the Illustrious Prince of Orange after a triple victory, viz: Groll, Wesell, and the Bosch, had sate downe the last summer to refresh him-selfe euen la den with honnor; Sanballat and Tobiah, I meane they of Spayne and Flaunders rose early, &amp; went to bed late, eating the bread of carefulnesse, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>

Now that you may vnderstand what
<pb facs="tcp:1613:3"/>
they had in their eye, that should exhaust so much of their treasure this yeare, and perswade with their cleargie like the neighboring channels soe f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>eely to emptie themselues into the common sea; I shall acquaint you with Marques Spinolaes last will and testament left in the hands of the Infanta at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur out of these wars. Two things hee aduised out of his lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>g experience &amp; best observations, that might infest the States, whereof the first was, that the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of their commerce with forreine parts might be stoppd, or at least lesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, &amp; therfore would that from Dunkerk, Osten, &amp; other parts ships should bee set forth for the intercepting them in the narrow seas, which counsaile the world obserues hath bin taken, &amp; that with noe ordinary successe: that to this day Dunkerk a meane Dunghill hauen, dare write her selfe a M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. The 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi> was this, that they should not spend themselues thus yeare after yeare, in the beseiging, beleaguring, &amp; taking in of any one towne, which did spend them much treasure, &amp; could not much disaduantage the enimy<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> but that they should (though with double cost) attempt the diuiding of the Provinces, especially Holland &amp; Zeeland, which hee demonstrated to bee feasable. And for the better understanding the way, may it please you to take notice that about two or three houres sailing from Dort, there lies a village calld the Plate, with a conuenient hauen able to receiue many smal vessels: this village with the whole Iland uppon which it stands is all together vnfortified, &amp; soe are all places about it: this hauen lookes right against Princeland a place of the same strenght with the Plate, betwixt these two passe all our shipps to Zeland, Bergen, Ter Goose, Tertoll, Zeerikze<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

This with the consequences being vnderstood I shall labor to show yow what faythfull ouerseers the Marquese had to his wil, and how tender they are on the other side to follow the mind of the dead. After the Prince of Orange had retreated out of fflaunders, &amp; (whether through the foreslowing of time, or too many loope holes made in their counsails or unfaithfulnesse in men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted, or correspondence by any false heart with the enimy) he had lost his designe, &amp; inquartered himselfe at Drunen, neare Huisden, little other ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings came to vs, but the constant and extraordinary prouisions of the enimy by land &amp; water, especially concerning certaine sloopes, &amp; flat bottomed boates, &amp; an engeneering Preist, who should haue spent much oyle &amp; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in the advancing of a strange designe. The tidings whereof comming thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, &amp; the child being neere the birth the towne of Bergen petition the

            <p>Vppon the 11. of Septem: being thursday at 4. or 5' of the clock at night wee heard shooting from Falconesse, and the Doel, and there-abous, and saw shipping, but did generally conceiue that the enemy had made an attempt to come forth and was beaten back by our men, when as it appeared otherwise t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And since wee haue spoken of Muschle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeke, I must tell you of a passage that concernes the said Generall of theirs, where by I may put you in mind how fooles oracles may prooue wise-mens truths: not long before this attempt Count Iohn sending a Trumpet to our army, wished him if the Prince should aske what became of their shallopes, to answer that they meant shortly to come eate some Muscles: hee came to y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> place indead, but I suppose hee had not time to fill his belly, or if hee tasted them I thinke hee hath not yet disgested them, that he cannot much reioyse at his banquet. Some other sloopes followed their Generall to Prince-land, and fired them at landing, so that betwene Willemstadt and Musclecreeke I saw diuers of the hulls of them lying by the shore; the rest quirred their boates with what speede they could, feare giuing them wings, and confusion and distraction taking away their wits: the reason they giue for making this great haste to the land is, because on these in-land waters they could expect noe quarter, and euery worme will reade us a lecture of the sweetenesse of life, 1400. seing a horse-man vppon a dike gaue themselues to him: a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest for one man! Divers in landing were drowned, many stript them selves to swim and so came naked to our army, most of their ships by the morning light were found in new Fosse-mere where they lay that day with our ships by them. Wee shall not neede to write what they returned the Preists for their benedictions, but certainely many Tuns of diuels, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the Preist who had the cheife hand in the plot, and did boaste great

of carriing shipps under water and promising to bring their souldiers into Berghen, which hee did truly performe: You must conceiue what a suddayne change heere was, when our men came to take possession of their vessels, &amp; they scrambled away in the mud, which mynds me of a merry answere of the Prince to one that told him the Preist would bring their men vnder the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hee sayd he then must send to Zeland for some fishermen to prick them vp vpon their Eel-speares. By 8. in the morning newes came to the Prince of their forfaking their boates, whereupon he commanded diuers companies to march towards Steen-berghen to enconter them supposing they might make head, but before our men were vpon their march, tidings came that most of them had giuen them selues prisoners; &amp; by 11. of the clock the first sight of them wee saw was 4, or 5. Captaynes with 2<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Capuchins presented to the Prince, with whome hee enterayned neere an houres talke, who all blamed Count Iohn for his starting at a pinch: The Capucians were presently begd by the Duke of vensdome, into whose tuition and fauor they were soone retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: the next sight that was presented to vs was a fat trumpetter of Count Iohns in a carr there followed him the Captaine of the Princes ship on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe behinde a Gentleman, with the colours of the Admirall of their fleete, being a Burgoignian crosse which hee presented to the Prince; after him fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in two diuifions the prisoners, garded by a troope of the Duke of Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, which were betweene 2. and 3000. before the last diuision was a wagon laden with their Officers; and this was obseruable, that among all these, and 900. more wich lay at Steen-bergen there was no English at all, but they were all Dutch, and Wallons; these were sent to such places, as the towne of Berg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen had to entertaine them in, especially an old peice of a Church receiued most.

The weeke following the Prince commanded most of the prisoners to bee set vppon ships without fayle or rudder, by the head at Berghen, till order should bee taken for ransome: the poore women at Antwerpe who had their husbands in the Service, with their heauy complaynts at Bergen gates made vs know how welcome those tidings were at Antwerpe: the last weeke the Drossart of Breda treated for their deliuery, and so they are departing home, you may iudge with what ioy they shall bee intertained; and presently vppon the miscarriage of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise their army marcheth both from Prince-land, and Rosendale, whereof 32. companies of foote are gone for Breda, and 10. of horse.</p>

            <p n="19">19, The Lord doth not bind himsele to any particular meanes that wee many times vse &amp; to often trust vnto, either for our deliuerance, or the confusi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on of our enemies: wee iudged of one meane, he vsed another in this great work, as was playne to be seene.</p>

It is admirable to see what a man or people may receiue in poynt of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor &amp; doe like wise in matter of Action, if the Lord goe out with them; as this is notable, this Prince of Orange neuer yet (since hee had the command) went out, but hee returued triumphing. the Lord euer make him triumphing &amp; victorious in his cause.</p>

The Vses wee may make in a word are these</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let vs euer heereafter learne to know the creature by their owne names, &amp; not to call a horse or a man a God, or a water or fort a Sauiour: wee may take vp <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he words of the repenting church Hos 14. The more fatherles the more merry, or the lesse wee Idolize vpon our selves the greater succor we may looke for from heauen.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Since the Lord can rule &amp; guide, dispatch &amp; ouercome workes of this nature so well; since hee hath thus graciously appeared in 31. as formerly in 88. let both England &amp; Holland bee willing to giue him the helme into his owne hands for euer. I wish his quarrell agaynst vs all bee not that wee haue vsed him too much like a Comon-man. wee see (though wee had never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued his word) that his place is at the sterne, let not Religion lackquey to Policy: Kisse the sonne least hee bee angry. Psal 2.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Giue him (who hath done all, &amp; deserueth all) all the glory: Ioseph may haue any thing in Potiphars house but his wife, &amp; in Pharaohs but his throne: as tender is the Lord of his honor &amp; glory as they of either. Shall wee euen greiue his good spirit more. shall wee euer slight his sabbaths? can it bee?</p>

               </gap>ay not our foolish harts: the skill will bee how to improoue the mercy. Sisera is then vndone when hee his careles in Iaels tent, who was a Neutrall: &amp; such is outward prosperity, good &amp; bad may share in it, the wisdome is how to vse it; hee need walke warily that goes on a glassy sea with iron shooes. But the wind is fayre, the sea-men call, the Dutch printer is weary hee craues pardon for his faults, I must end before I am halfe way the mayne. This at least may saue the writing many letters: You may trust the Intelligence for the Truth: &amp; to the God of Truth I commend You.</p>
