            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This libertie I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue taken to my self, that (now &amp; then) where an English word of a more full signification, by way of a Metaphor or otherwise, doth oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre, then the Latin affordeth (&amp;

this some times falleth out not by reason of any defect of the Authour, but through the fullnes of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish) I make choyce of the said Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish word for the greater redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancie of the sense. In like sort (here and there, though rarely) I haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted a word or two, to make the drift of the Authour to appeare more turgent and forcing in the English (and, thereby to begett a <hi>Pathos</hi> &amp; to moue the Reader, more fully) then the compendious short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Latin (being translated without anie addition) would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye.

            <p>WHEN this yeare past, by my chosen institution of life, and commaund of my Superiours (<hi>Most excellent Men)</hi> I returned into this Iland, I did finde stormes much more boysterous and rugged vpon the coasts of England, then those, which I had lately escaped in the Brittan Ocean. After <hi>I</hi> had entered into the hart of the Realme, I saw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more vsuall then vnusuall punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16690:17"/>
nothing more certaine, then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaintie of danger. I closed myself to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather, as well as the present state of things would permit, being mindefull of the Cause, mindefull of the Times. And for feare, that perhaps I should be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, before my entrance-in was ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured, I presently did set downe in wryting, Who I was, that was come; What I sought after; What manner of warre, and against whome, I did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime. The first draught of it, I eue<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> kept about me, that, if so I were taken, it also with me might be taken: A Copie thereof I deliuered to a friend, the which (truly without my intention and priuitie) was made knowne to manie. The Aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes doe with great indignitie and atroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie entertayne this Wryting being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged; And among other things, they most maliciously insist vpon, that I being but <hi>One,</hi> dare in matter of Religion send

this Challenge to them <hi>All;</hi> Although it is certaine, that I should not be alone in this Combat, if the disputation might procede by publike Warrant. <hi>Hanmer</hi> and <hi>Chark</hi> haue shaped an Answer to my Demaunds.

               <p>I here forbeare to speake, how these men in their Versions of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture haue peruerted the Scripture; they standing chargeable with most insufferable abuses of this nature. I am loath to snatch this labour out of the hands of <hi>Gregorie Martin</hi> my Collegue, and one most skilfull in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:16690:28"/>
the Tongues, who more accuratly can performe the same; vpon whom and some others this taske is now layed. The atrocitie, which here I labour to vn-fould, is far more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinorous, and scarcely piacular: There are certain pettie Doctours (forsooth) stept vp, who euen drunke with an impetuous phrensie, and bearing themselues <hi>great,</hi> as if they did carrye about with them the <hi>Holie-Ghost,</hi> haue layed their prophane fingars vpon God's owne Hand-wryting: condemning manie passages thereof as maymed, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, as false, as surreptitious: Some parts of it they haue correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, some (by circumcising the Text) corroded, and others wholy disauthorized. And for their San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie in these their irreligious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedures, they are glad to intrench
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:16690:28"/>
themselues in <hi>Luther's Spirit,</hi> as in a rampire fabricated of Phantasmes and paynted walles; that so they may not be wholy dumme or mute, when they fall vpon such Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, as doe impugne their Errours; And yet they finde no lesse difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to fortifye and strengthen their Cause thereby, then if they should, by endeauouring to supp vp sparks of fire, or eate stones.</p>
               <p>This then first Reason or Motiue (which I haue planted, as a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering-peece, in the foreparte of my challenge) seemeth to me most pressing and strong; the which, after it had (in my owne sight) fully played vpon the feeble &amp; broken forces of the Aduersarie, did (I confesse) giue courage to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Man, and to one trayned in this kinde of fight, to wage warre
