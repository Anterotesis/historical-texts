         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Parted from <hi>Breſt</hi> the third of
<hi>March,</hi> 1685. on the King's Ship,
called the <hi>Hawk,</hi> accompanied by
one of His Majeſties Frigats, named the
<hi>Maline,</hi> and that with ſo favourable a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60708:3"/>
Wind, that in ſeven days we arrived at
the <hi>Madera</hi> Iſlands; we thus happily
paſt on till we came to four or five de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
northward of the Equinoctial
line. When we were overtaken by a
calm, and ſuffered extreme heats, but
which yet did not much incommode us;
the wind began again to blow, and we
paſt the line three hundred and fifty
degrees five minutes of longitude, thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
days after our ſetting out. We
found the water here to be as freſh
and good, as if it had ſprang from ſome
pleaſant fountain, which made us neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
to uſe that in our Jarrs. At five
degrees ſouthward of the line we found
the Winds very inconſtant, but the
heats not troubleſom, and I left not
off my winter garments in all this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.
The Winds, though variable,
yet carried us our courſe, ſo that we
arrived at the Cape of Good Hope the
31ſt of <hi>May,</hi> to take in freſh water,
and other Proviſions, although my old
ſtore was not exhauſted. We caſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
late at night, and found in this
road four Dutch Veſſels, that came
from <hi>Holland,</hi> and had on Board a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60708:3"/>
who was to order affairs in
behalf of the Eaſt-India Company.
Monſieur <hi>St. Martin</hi> Major General, a
French man, who has been in the Dutch
ſervice this thirty years, was alſo in
one of theſe Veſſels, intending for <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavia,</hi>
where his Employment lay. The
Commiſſioner General ſent to comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

the next morning his Nephew and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary,
came to offer me whatſoever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            <p>The Dutch have here a ſmall Fort,
and near an hundred Houſes about a
Muſquet ſhot off it, which are well
built, and in good order. The ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this place is very pleaſant, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
bounded by a great Mountain,
inhabited by an infinite number of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kies,
which oft come down into their

are alſo ſeveral Summer-houſes, two

and beyond this vaſt Mountain
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60708:4"/>

               </gap>
and Roots which it ſupplies them with

when they come here to paſs to the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60708:4"/>
               <hi>Indies,</hi> or returning to their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
            <p>I found there a French Gardiner;
who had heretofore learnt his Trade
at the Gardens of Monſieur at <hi>St. Cloud.</hi>
The Soil is very good, and yields good
ſtore of grain. A perſon, worthy cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
has aſſured me he ſaw an hundred
and ſixty Ears of Corn on one ſtalk.
The Inhabitants of the Countrey have
fair Countenances, but herein deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
for they are mere bruits; they
go naked, excepting that part which
they cover with a naſty Skin of a beaſt.
They till not the Ground, yet abound
with Cattel, ſuch as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ows, Hogs
and Sheep. They ſcarce eat any of
theſe, their chiefeſt dyet being Milk
and Butter, which, for cleanlineſs
ſake, they make in Sheep Skins. They
have a root which hath the taſte of
the Kernel of one of our ſmall Nuts,
which ſerves them for bread. They
are indifferently skilled in Simples,
which they can uſe in the Cure of
Wounds, and other Diſtempers. The

that have moſt Cattle, which they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60708:5"/>

               </gap>
have wars with each other about their
paſtures. Are greatly annoyed with
wild Beaſts, there being more than a
few Lions, Leopards, Tygers, Wolves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
wild Dogs, Elephants, and other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
Creatures. All their Arms are
a kind of poiſoned Lance, to ſtrike
theſe Beaſts with. They have a kind
of Toyls wherewith they encloſe their
Cattel at night: They trouble not
themſelves much about Religion, yet
obſerve ſome ſlight Ceremonies to the
Full-moon, which do not ſignifie much.
Their Language ſeems difficult to be
underſtood. They have much game,
as Pheaſants, Partridges, three or four
ſorts, Peacocks, Hares, Coneys, and
Deer in ſuch abundance, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a Man ſhall ſee near twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
together in a plain. We ate ſome
of theſe before mentioned, and found
them admirable good. The Sheep are
here very large, of fourſcore pound
weight commonly. Here are great
quantity of Cows and Oxen. The Sea
in this Bay is full of Fiſh, which are of
good reliſh, ſome of them having the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60708:5"/>
taſte of Salmon. This place abounds
with Sea-wolves, and when in our Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop
we perceived an infinite number
came tumbling by us, of which we
could not kill one. Several wild Horſes
ſcamper along the plains, which, if I
miſtake not, are inferiour to none in
other parts, both in ſtrength, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
colours and ſhapes; I brought
along with me one of their Skins;
they are hard to be maſtered. This
being ſuch a good Countrey, the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
ſend continually freſh people to
it, who make every ſeaſon conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
diſcoveries. Some ſay they have
found out Gold and Silver Mines; of
which 'tis not to be expected they
ſhould ſay much themſelves. The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is here very good, proceeding from
ſeveral Springs, near Rivers which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,
as I already noted, with Fiſh.</p>
            <p>We parted from this Road the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
of <hi>June,</hi> with ſo favourable a
North Wind, and North North Weſt,
that we ſoon got into the open Sea,
and that night ſteered to <hi>Bantam:</hi> we
endured vehement Rains, and met with
great Seas, till we reached the Iſles of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60708:6"/>
               <hi>Madegaſcar,</hi> which was on the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of <hi>June.</hi> On theſe Seas you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
great quantity of Birds, but find
therein no Fiſh. Till <hi>July</hi> we encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
with boiſterous Seas, and met with
variable Winds, which forced us forty
degrees ſouthward, where we found a
Weſtern Wind, with which we made
great way. The twenty fourth the
<hi>Maline</hi> Frigat was ſeparated from us
by bad weather, being driven to the
North. The third of <hi>Auguſt</hi> we found
the Sea leſs troubleſome, and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more favourable, and at break of
day diſcovered an Iſland ſeven or eight
leagues before us, which ſurpriſed us,
it not being deſcribed in our Chart; It
is ſituated ten degrees nineteen minutes
of latitude Southward. This Iſle lies
convenient for the finding of the Iſle of
<hi>Java,</hi> which cannot be diſtant from it
above an hundred and fifty Leagues,
and ſince we underſtood 'tis called the
Iſle of <hi>Money,</hi> being ill ſet down in
our Maps, which place it near that of
<hi>Java.</hi> This Iſle lies very high; we
coaſted yet two days with a good gale,
and on the fifth about eight in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60708:6"/>
we diſcovered the Iſle of <hi>Java</hi>
which gave us much more Joy, and the
ſeventh following we found our ſelves
between the Princes Iſle, and that of
the Emperour, which make the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of the Straits. The Iſle of the
Emperour lies on the ſide of <hi>Sumatra,</hi>
and the Iſle of the Prince on the ſide of
<hi>Java.</hi> We lay four days between theſe
Iſlands, the Winds and Streams oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
us in ſo violent a manner, that
what we gained in twelve hours, we
loſt in four, by means of calms, which
often happened. Before we entred this
Strait, the Frigat which loſt us on the
twenty fourth of <hi>June,</hi> came up to our
Ship ſide this day, before we knew who
ſhe was. The thirteenth we left theſe
Iſlands behind us, and caſt Anchor
within a League of <hi>Java.</hi> There came
on board us ſeveral perſons in little
Boats, who brought us the Countrey
Fruits, ſuch as Coco's, the water which
is contained in them being excellent
drink, as alſo Melons, Citrons, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
otherlike Preſents, which much
refreſht our Men, tired with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60708:7"/>
of the Sea, and over-run with
the Scurvy.</p>
            <p>On the ſixteenth in the morning we
came to <hi>Bantam,</hi> where I found the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi>
Frigat, which tarried For me two
days: The Captain of it came and
told me, that the Governour of the
place would not give him entrance,
but onely preſented him with ſome
Fowl and Fruits: whereupon I ſent
Mr. <hi>De Forbin,</hi> my Lieutenant, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment
this Governour from me, and
entreat him to grant me leave to land
my ſick Men, to take in freſh water,
and other neceſſaries. He returned
anſwer, he was not the Maſter of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam,</hi>
and that there was a King of the
place, who would not admit any ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to his Countrey. The <hi>Hollanders</hi>
make uſe of this King's Name, being
unwilling that ſtrange Veſſels ſhould
come amongſt them, eſpecially the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans.
Since they have ſettled there,
they have driven all other Nations out.
'Tis a great Town, and well peopled
by the Natives, before the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
became Maſters of it, 'twas the chiefeſt
place of the <hi>Indies</hi> for Commerce, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60708:7"/>
came there from <hi>Europe, Perſia,
China, Japon,</hi> the Great <hi>Mogol</hi>'s Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and divers other parts, but now
the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have got all into their
Hands, which is of vaſt advantage to
them; for this place may be compared
to what heretofore was <hi>Cales</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi>
As ſoon as I received the Governour's
Anſwer, who yet told me, that if I
would go to <hi>Batavia,</hi> I ſhould find
there a kind reception, I therefore
weighed Anchor, and ſet ſail for that
place, to which there's but fifteen
Leagues. I was three days before I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
there; for having no Pilot that
was acquainted with thoſe parts, I fell
on ſeveral Iſlands, which cauſed me to
caſt Anchor every night, and in the
day time to move with ſmall ſail, ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all places I went over; but I arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
on the thirteenth at night, where
aſſoon as I had caſt Anchor, I ſent my
Lieutenant to the General, to comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
him, and to deſire leave to bring
my ſick Men on ſhoar, and take in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments.
He took my Complement
in good part, and returned anſwer, he
would take care I ſhould be ſatisfied. I
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60708:8"/>
ſent next morning ſixty five ſick Men
on ſhoar, who all recovered their
healths in ſeven days that I tarried at
<hi>Batavia.</hi> On the nineteenth in the
morning the General ſent me a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by three Officers, the Summ of
which was to deſire me to come on
ſhoar, offering me his own Houſe to
lodge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in. After neceſſary Thanks, I
anſwered, I wiſhed my Orders would
have permitted me that Liberty. The
General ſent me a great Shalop, laden
with all ſorts of Indian Fruits, Herbs,
new Bread, two Oxen, two Sheep, and
thus continued for ſeveral days preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
us. On the twenty ſecond I lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>incognito,</hi> and viewed the Town in
a ſmall Boat. 'Tis like <hi>Venice,</hi> having
Chanels which run through every ſtreet,
and planted with great Trees which
yield an agreeable ſhade, as well to the
Chanels as the Streets; the Houſes are
built as they are in <hi>Holland;</hi> there is a
Citadel indifferently well fortified; the
Town in encloſed with a Wall, and
great Ditch, but not deep. The Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
round about it are extreme pleaſant,
being related to curious Gardens, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60708:8"/>
Fiſh-ponds, wherein are admirable Fiſh
of all ſorts. In this Town the Traders
are exceeding rich, and ſpare no coſt

There is in <hi>Batavia</hi> about fifty Coaches,
ſome of which are very ſtately; their

make amends, are in ſo good plight,

contains two hundred Leagues

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60708:9"/>
ſent to the General for a Pilot for <hi>Siam,</hi>
mine having never been there; he lent
me one who had ſailed there four times;
for theſe civilities, I ſent Mr. <hi>Forbin</hi> to
thank him.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Sunday,</hi> being the twenty ſixth
of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> at ſix of the Clock in the
morning, we ſet ſail, and ſteered our
courſe to paſs the Strait of <hi>Banca;</hi> we
advanced that day ten Leagues with a
ſmall Wind, and at nine at night I was
told of a Sail that made towards my
Veſſel, whereupon I bid the Officer be
prepared; when immediately I ſaw out
of my Window this Ship coming up to
us: we called out to know what ſhe
was, but could have no anſwer, and
coming on the Deck, I found all our
Men provided for her, and the Bolt-ſprit
of this Ship laid on croſs my
Stern, I cauſed about twenty Muſquet
Shot to be fired among her Men, which
immediately made her clear her ſelf
of us, and taking the advantage of the
Wind, and clapping on all her Sails,
we knew not what Nation ſhe was of,
for no body in the Ship ſpoke one
word, and we obſerved but few Men on
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60708:9"/>
board her. I ſuppoſe her to have been
ſome Merchant Ship, guided by unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
hands; they did our Ship ſome
miſchief, but the damage was repaired
next morning.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Tueſday,</hi> being the twenty eighth,
at night we diſcovered the entrance of
the Strait of <hi>Banca,</hi> and on the twenty
ninth in the morning we entred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
Although we had a good Dutch
Pilot, yet we ran upon a muddy bank
of Sand, there being many of this kind
in this Strait, and ti being uſual for
Veſſels to meet with them without
much hurt, therefore this did not much
diſturb us, for I cauſed a ſmall Anchor
to be caſt on the ſide of <hi>Sumatra,</hi> and
in leſs than two hours we got off clear
from this Bank. We were three days
paſſing this Strait. The Iſle of <hi>Suma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi>
is on the left, and contains two
hundred and fifty Leagues in length,
and about fifty in breadth. The <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
have four or five Fortreſſes here,
its people are Mahometans, and under
the Regiment of five or ſix Kings. The
Queen of <hi>Achem</hi> poſſeſſes one of the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
Countries, and governs with great
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60708:10"/>
Authority and Regularity. The <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
are in a manner Maſters of all
theſe Princes, they deal with them for
whatſoever the Iſland yields, where 'tis
ſaid there are golden Mines, great
quantities of Pepper, Rice, all ſorts of
Cattle, and in ſome Cantons the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are very barbarous, and the Kings
are oft at war one with one another.
Thoſe who receive the <hi>Hollanders</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
are ever the ſtrongeſt: 'Tis the
ſame in the Iſle of <hi>Java,</hi> for three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Europeans do beat five or ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Men of theſe Nations, who know
not tho Art of War. It lies four de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
Southward of the Equinoctial
Line. The Dutch have a Fort on the
ſide of the Strait of <hi>Banca,</hi> ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with twenty four pieces of Canon;
the Fort is built upon the River called
<hi>Palembone,</hi> which runs ſo violently into
the Sea, that three or four months in
the year, in rainy weather, the water
of it, when in the Sea, does yet keep
its freſhneſs.</p>
            <p>The Iſle of <hi>Banca</hi> lay on the right
hand of us, being about fourty Leagues
long; The Dutch have a Fort there,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60708:10"/>
and drive a conſiderable Trade with
the Natives of the Countrey; 'tis ſaid
to be a very good and fruitfull Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
when I ſailed by the River of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lembone,</hi>
the Dutch were there lading
two Veſſels with Pepper. On the third
of <hi>September</hi> we paſt the Line again by
the help of good weather, the air be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
temperate, and without exceſſive
Heats, ſo that I ſtill wore my Cloth
ſuit, till I paſt over to the Coaſts of
<hi>Africa.</hi> We came before the Strait of
<hi>Malaca,</hi> which has four or five paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
or entrances, but the Streams were
ſo great, and running ſometimes againſt
us, that we were forced oft to caſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor;
for when the Calm took us, the
Streams forcibly carried us a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
but we left not this Coaſt, by
reaſon of the Winds, which always
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>low from the land, and greatly hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
us in our courſe. I believe this
Countrey's Air to be good, for we had
many ſick, who were all recovered by
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t.</p>
            <p>On the fifth we diſcovered the Iſle
of <hi>Polimon,</hi> which is inhabited by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laiſes,</hi>
who are Mahometans. This is a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60708:11"/>
plentifull Countrey, and obedient to a
Prince by whom 'tis governed. The
Queen of <hi>Achem</hi> has ſome pretenſions to
it, and for this effect ſhe ſends thither
every year ſome Veſſels; but this Prince
being not willing to engage in a War
againſt her, his people pay her Tribute.
There came a ſmall Boat to our Ship
ſide, which brought us ſome Fiſh and
Fruits. This Iſle is diſtant from the
Continent about ſix Leagues, part of
its Coaſts was heretofore ſubject to the
King of <hi>Siam;</hi> but it has been ſince
ſome years in the poſſeſſion of two or
three Kings, one of which is the King
of <hi>Malais.</hi> This is a very unſociable
Nation, and will enter into no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</p>
            <p>From the fifth to the fifteenth we had
but ſmall Winds, and very variable, and
Calms which cauſed us oft to caſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor,
as alſo by reaſon of Streams which
run along this Coaſt. From the Strait
of <hi>Banca</hi> to <hi>Siam</hi> the Land is not wont
to be left.</p>
            <p>The ſame day we found our ſelves
before <hi>Ligor,</hi> which is the chief place
belonging to the King of <hi>Siam.</hi> The
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60708:11"/>
               <hi>Hollanders</hi> have a habitation there, and
liberty of Trade. 'Tis hard to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
the Joy which the <hi>Siamoiſes</hi> whom
we brought along with us had to ſee
their own Countrey, and it cannot be
better compared than to that which
we felt at our return, when God
brought us ſafe to <hi>Breſt.</hi> Here died
a young Gentleman having been ill
five months with a bloudy Flux, whom
the King ſent to attend me in my
Voyage, he was a Youth of great hopes,
and I was much afflicted at the loſs of
him.</p>
            <p>In ſhort (thanks be to God) on the
twenty fourth we caſt Anchor before
the River of <hi>Siam.</hi> Our whole Ship's
crew were in good health. I ſent to the
Biſhop of <hi>Metellopolis</hi> Mr. <hi>le Vacher</hi> a
Miſſionary, who came with the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darins</hi>
into <hi>France,</hi> and whom I brought
along with them, with charge to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
him to come to me that I might
learn what had happened this eighteen
months ſince the King of <hi>Siam</hi> ſent
into <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the twenty ninth the Biſhop
came on board with the Abbat of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60708:12"/>
               <hi>Lionne,</hi> who informed me of whatſoever
had paſt, telling me that the King of
<hi>Siam</hi> having heard at midnight of my
arrival by Mr. <hi>Conſtance</hi> one of his
Miniſters, he ſhewed great joy, and
ordered him to go and advertiſe the
Biſhop of it, and to diſpatch two <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darins</hi>
of the firſt rank, who are in a
manner as the chief Gentlemen of the
King's Chamber are in <hi>France,</hi> to aſſure
me of the joy he conceived at my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival.
They came two days after on
board me, whom I received in my
Cabin; the Biſhop ſitting by me, and
they and others ſitting down on Carpets
laid on the floor, it being the cuſtome
of the Country to ſit in that manner,
there being no perſon but the King
who ſits higher.</p>
            <p>They told me the King their Maſter
had commanded them to ſhew me the
Joy he had at my arrival, and at the
News of our King's having vanquiſhed
all his Enemies, and become abſolute
Maſter of his Kingdom. Having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted
to them how much I thought
my ſelf beholden to the King their
Maſter, and anſwered what they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60708:12"/>
touching our Prince, I told them
I was extremely ſatisfied with the
Governor of <hi>Bancok,</hi> for his reception
of thoſe I ſent him, as alſo with the
Preſents he had made me. They reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he had done onely his duty, ſeeing
in <hi>France</hi> the King their Maſter's Envoys
had been ſo well received, and that
moreover I merited this good uſage by
my procurement of an Union between
the Kings of <hi>Siam</hi> and of <hi>France.</hi>
Having treated them with the honours
and civilities uſual in ſuch like occaſions
in theſe Countries, I preſented them
with Tea and Comfits. Theſe two
<hi>Mandarins</hi> were well ſhap'd Men, of
about 25 years of Age, and Apparelled
after their mode, being bare headed,
without Shoes or Stockings, wearing
a kind of long Scarf down to their
Knees and coming between their Legs
was faſtned behind. This Scarf was
of painted linen neatly done, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidred
at the edges; from the waſte
upwards, they had nothing but a kind
of Muſlin waſtcoat, which they let
hang over this Scarf, the ſleeves being
ſomewhat large, but not long. They
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60708:13"/>
remained about an hour on board our
Veſſel, and I ſaluted them with nine
pieces of Canon at their departure.</p>
            <p>On the ninth of <hi>October</hi> Mr. <hi>Conſtance,</hi>
the King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Miniſter I lately
mentioned, and who though a ſtranger,
has obtained by his merit the chief
place in the King's favour, ſent to
Complement me by his Secretary who
was an honeſt man, and offered me from
himſelf ſuch a great preſent of Fruits,
beſides Oxen, Hoggs, Pullets, Ducks
and ſuch like things, that all the Ships
crew were fed with them for four days
together. Theſe refreſhments are
gratefull when a man has been ſeven
or eight months at Sea.</p>
            <p>On the eighth the Biſhop of <hi>Metel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopolis</hi>
who had returned to the chief
City of <hi>Siam,</hi> came on board us again
with two <hi>Mandarin's</hi> to enquire as
from the King after my Health, and
to inform me how impatiently he took
my delays of ſeeing him, entreating
me to haſten on ſhore. I returned their
Complement, and told them I ſhould
ſoon be there. I gave theſe <hi>Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins</hi>
the ſame Entertainment I gave the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60708:13"/>
firſt, ſaluting them alſo at their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with nine pieces of Canon. About
two of the Clock the ſame day I went
into my Shalop, and thoſe of my At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
into Boats which the King had

here an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſel, which ſaluted
me with his Cannon, which were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
by the Forts which defend
both ſides of the River; which Forts
are regular enough, and well furniſhed
with Guns. I lodged in a Houſe well
built and furniſht, where I was treated
after the faſhion of the Countrey.</p>
            <p>The next Morning I parted at eight of
the clock attended by all the <hi>Mandarins</hi>
and Governours who were come to
complement me. At my departure I
was alſo ſaluted by the Cannon, and
arrived at Noon in a Houſe built on
purpoſe for me, and as well furniſht
as the former. There was near ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
two Fortreſſes which ſaluted
me with all their Guns, and two <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darins</hi>
more came to receive me. I
was very well ſerved at Dinner; and
I parted here at three a clock, and
the Governour of <hi>Bancok</hi> took his
leave of me to return to his charge.
Holding on my courſe I came to two
Ships the one <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the other
<hi>Dutch</hi> lying at anchor, who alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
all their Cannon, and I arrived
at ſeven at night at a convenient Houſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60708:15"/>
furniſhed after the ſame manner as the
preceding ones, where I was received
and treated by other <hi>Mandarins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The eleventh in the morning I par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thence, and went and dined in
another Houſe, and at night I lay and
was treated as before.</p>
            <p>On the twelfth I lodged two Leagues
off of <hi>Siam,</hi> where I was again recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by two <hi>Mandarins.</hi> The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Merchants of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi>
Companies came to complement my
arrival in thoſe parts, and as to the
<hi>French</hi> they attended me all the way. 
Here I remained till I made my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance.</p>
            <p>The River of <hi>Siam</hi> called <hi>Menon</hi> is
very large and commodious, being
adorned all along the ſides of it with
pleaſant Trees; but three or four
months in the Year all theſe places
are overflowed with water, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the Houſes are built on a kind
of ſledges, and made all of <hi>Bamboos.</hi>
This wood ſerves the <hi>Siamoiſes</hi> both
for the foundations and tops of their
houſes, and for infinite purpoſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
making uſe of it as we do
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60708:15"/>
Flints and Steels, for they need onely
take a little of this wood on a heap,
and rub it together, and it preſently
lights. All the people of theſe parts
have little Boats to paſs from one
houſe to another for what they want.
Here are ſeen none but Women to
work, the Men being for the moſt part
employed in the Kings ſervice, whoſe
Slaves they are. I had the ſame honours
ſhewed me, as to the King when he is
wont to paſs on the River. I could
ſee no body in the houſes, all people
were in Barges, or on the ſide of the
River, lying flat on their Bellies, and
their hands joyned againſt their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads.
They reverence in ſuch a
manner their Prince, that they dare
not lift up their eyes to look on him.
I obſerved that the houſes where I
lodged were painted with red, that I
might be treated as his own perſon,
there being onely the Royal Houſes
of that colour.</p>
            <p>All the <hi>Mandarins</hi> which came to
receive me on the River, ſtill accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
me. The Princes alſo viſited
me. They have all convenient Barges,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60708:16"/>
in the middle of which there is a kind
of Throne whereon they ſit, and they
uſually go but one in a Barge, on both
ſides of them are their Arms, as Scimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
Swords and Darts, and even Forks.
They are all cloathed in the manner
I already mentioned. A <hi>Portugueſe</hi>
whom the King had made General
of the Troops in <hi>Bancok</hi> continually
accompanied me, and gave orders for
all things. I was attended with near
fifty or ſixty Barges, ſome of which
were fifty, ſixty, ſeventy and eighty
foot long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having Oars from twenty
to an hundred. They row not after
our manner, they ſit two on each bench,
one on one ſide and another on the
other, their Faces turned on that ſide
where they go, and have a Scul which
they call <hi>Pagais,</hi> being about four foot
long, with which they take a world
of pains, being contented with ſod
Rice, and if they have a piece of Fiſh,
they believe they Dine ſumptuouſly.</p>
            <p>They eat of a Leaf which they call
<hi>Betel,</hi> which is like Ivy, and a kind of
Corn which they call <hi>Arrek,</hi> putting
Lime thereon, and this gives it a taſte.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60708:16"/>
They eat the Tobacco growing in
their Countrey, which is very ſtrong,
all which blackens their Teeth, which
they eſteem the handſomeſt. A man
may live after this rate for fifteen
pence a month for they uſually drink
nothing but water. They have a kind
of <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> which they call <hi>Rack,</hi>
made with Rice. When I came to a
Houſe which was intended for me,
all the <hi>Mandarins</hi> that accompanied me
made a lane for me to paſs through to
my Chamber door.</p>
            <p>On the thirteenth I ſent word to
the King by the <hi>Mandarins</hi> that were
with me, that I had been informed of
the manner wherewith they were wont
to receive Ambaſſadors, and it being
very different from that of <hi>France,</hi>
I entreated him to ſend me ſomebody
to inſtruct me about my entrance.</p>
            <p>On the fourteenth he ſent me the Sieur
<hi>Conſtance,</hi> with whom I had a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
the Biſhop of <hi>Metropolis</hi>
being our Interpreter. We had a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
diſpute, and I would bate nothing of
the mode of receiving Ambaſſadors in
<hi>France,</hi> which at length he granted me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:60708:17"/>
On the fifteenth the <hi>Tunquinoiſes</hi> came
to complement me on my arrival.</p>
            <p>The ſixteenth the <hi>Cochinchinoiſes</hi> did
the ſame.</p>
            <p>The ſeventeenth Mr. <hi>Conſtance</hi> came
to me, and brought with him four
ſtately Barges to carry the Preſents
which his Majeſty ſent to the King of
<hi>Siam.</hi> And on the ſame day the King
gave order to all the <hi>Indian</hi> Nations
that reſide at <hi>Siam,</hi> to congratulate
my arrival, and to pay me all the
eſpect which is due to the character
of an Ambaſſador to ſo great a King.
They came to me at ſix at night,
each of them habited after their own
manner; there were of forty different
Nations, and each of them of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
independent one of another, and
that which ſeemed moſt remarkable,
was that among the reſt there was the
ſon of a King who was driven out of
his Countrey, and taking <hi>Siam</hi> for
his refuge, entreated aſſiſtance toward
his re-eſtabliſhment; their dreſſes were
the ſame as the <hi>Siamoiſes,</hi> ſome ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Turbants, others <hi>Armenian</hi> Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
and others bare-headed, like the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60708:17"/>
common <hi>Siamoiſes;</hi> perſons of quality
having Bonnets of the ſame faſhion of
our Dragoons, made of white Muſlin
which tye under their Chins with a
ſtring, being all of them barefooted.</p>
            <p>The King made Mr. <hi>Conſtance</hi> tell
me, that he would give me Audience
the next morning, being the eighteenth.
I ſet out at ſeven of the clock in the
morning in the manner which I ſhall
relate, having firſt recited the honour
wherewith the King of <hi>Siam</hi> received
the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Letter. 'Tis true
he is wont to receive with reſpect the
Letters delivered him by Ambaſſadors
of foreign Potentates, but he would
give a diſtinct honour to that of our
great Monarch. There came forty of the
chiefeſt <hi>Mandarins</hi> in the Court, two of
which were <hi>Oyas,</hi> which is to ſay Dukes,
who told me that all the Barges were
ready to receive his Majeſty's Letter,
and carry my ſelf to the Palace.
The Letter was in my Chamber in
a golden Cabinet; the <hi>Mandarins</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
entred proſtrated themſelves,
their hands cloſed and adjoyning to
their foreheads, and their faces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60708:18"/>
the ground, and ſaluted in this
poſture the King's Letter for three
times together. I being ſeated on a
Throne near the Letter, received this
honour, which was never paid to any
but his Majeſty of <hi>France,</hi> which Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
being ended, I took the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with the golden Cabinet, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
carried it ſeven or eight paces,
I gave it to the Abbat of <hi>Choiſy,</hi>
who came from <hi>France</hi> with me. He
walkt at my right hand a little behind,
and carried it to the water ſide,
where I found a curious Barge, ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly
gilded, in which were two
<hi>Mandarins</hi> of the chief rank. I took
the Letter from Mr. <hi>Choiſy,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
carried it into the Barge with
me, I put it into the hands of theſe
<hi>Mandarins,</hi> who laid it on a ſtately
raiſed Table gilt; I entred into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
a very magnificent one, which
followed immediately that wherein
was the Letter of his Majeſty. Two
others alſo as ſtately as mine, in which
were <hi>Mandarins,</hi> rowed on either ſide
of that where the Letter was. Mine,
as I now ſaid, followed after Mr. <hi>Choiſy,</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:60708:18"/>
the Abbat was in another Barge next
to mine, and the Gentlemen which
accompanied me, and others of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in other Barges: Thoſe of the
Great <hi>Mandarins</hi> likewiſe were very
fine, and were on head of us. There
were about twelve gilt Barges, and near
two hundred others that followed us.
The King's Letter, the two Barges that
attended it, and mine, were in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.
All the Nations at <hi>Siam</hi> were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending,
and the whole River, although
very large, was covered with Barges.
We moved after this rate to the Town,
whoſe Cannons were diſcharged, which
never was done to any other Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
all the Ships ſaluted me likewiſe,
and at landing, I found a great golden
Chariot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which onely the King rode in.

               </gap> into this Chariot, which was drawn
by Horſes led by Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I afterwards
went into a glorious Chair, which was
carried by ten Men on their Shoulders;
the Abbat of <hi>Choiſy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> was alſo in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
but of leſs finery; the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
and <hi>Mandarins</hi> which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
me, were on Horſeback, all the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60708:19"/>
ſeveral Nations which dwell at <hi>Siam</hi>
walking on foot behind; the Proceſſion
was in this wiſe to the Caſtle, where
I found the Souldiers, who were drawn
up on each ſide of the Street, having
Head-pieces gilt with Gold, red Shirts
on, and a kind of Scarf of painted cloth,
which ſerved them for Breeches, but
having neither Shoes nor Stockings:
Some of them were armed with Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets,
others with Lances, others with
Bows and Arrows, and laſtly, ſome
with Pikes.</p>
            <p>There wanted not muſical inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as Trumpets, Drums, Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brels,
Pipes, little Bells and Horns,
which Muſick made a pleaſant noiſe;
and thus marched we the length of a
great Street, through an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of People. We came at lenght to
a great open place in which ſtood the
King's Palace, where were ranged on
each ſide Elephants of War: We af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
entred into the firſt Court of
the Palace, where I ſaw about two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Souldiers in a poſture of ſitting,
with the Butt-end of their Muſquets to
the ground ſtanding upright, they were
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60708:19"/>
placed ſix in a rank, in a direct line:
There were on the left ſeveral armed
Elephants, ready for War. We after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſaw an hundred Men on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
naked, and clothed after the Moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
Faſhion, having a Lance in their
Hands; all the Souldiers were accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
as I already mentioned; in this
place thoſe of foreign Nations left me,
excepting ſome Gentlemen who accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
me all the way. I paſt into two
other Courts which were garriſoned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the ſame manner, and I entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another, where was a great number
of <hi>Mandarins,</hi> all of them proſtrate on
the ground; here were ſix Horſes held,
each of them by two <hi>Mandarins;</hi> they
were well harneſt, all their Trappings
being of Gold and Silver, covered with
Pearls, Rubies and Diamonds, ſo thick
that a Man could ſcarce ſee the leather;
their Stirrups and Saddles were of Gold
and Silver, and the Horſes had golden
Rings on their Feet; there were alſo
ſeveral Elephants harneſſed in the ſame
manner the Coach Horſes were. The
Gentlemen entred into the Hall of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and placed themſelves before
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60708:20"/>
the King came into his Throne, and
when he was there attended with
Mr. <hi>Conſtans, du Barcalon,</hi> and the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
of <hi>Choiſy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> who carried the King's
Letter, I was ſurpriſed to ſee him on
a higher Throne, for Mr. <hi>Conſtans</hi> had
agreed with me, that the King ſhould
be on a Throne no higher than where
I might give my Letter with my own
hand, without ſtraining my ſelf; then
I told the Abbat <hi>de Choiſy,</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
they made me was forgotten, but
that I would not give the King my
Letter in this manner; the golden Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet
wherein 'twas put had a great
Handle, three foot long; 'twas imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
I would take hold on it, thus to raiſe
it to the King's Throne, but I was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to preſent His Majeſty's Letter to
the King in a befitting manner: Being
then come to the Door, I ſaluted the
King, the like I did alſo in the mid
way, and when I was near the place
where I was to ſit; having uttered
two words of my Harangue, I put my
Hat on, and ſate down, and continued
my Diſcourſe in theſe Terms.</p>

                        <p>THE King, my Maſter, who is now
ſo famous in the World, by
his great Victories, and the Peace
he has often granted his Enemies at
the head of his Armies, has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me to come to Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
to aſſure you of the particular
Eſteem he has for you.</p>
                        <p>He knows, Sir, Your princely
Qualities, the Wiſedom of your Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
the Magnificence of your
Court, the Grandeur of your States,
and eſpecially the Goodwill You bear
His Perſon, demonſtrated by the
continual Favour and Protection You
ſhew His Subjects, eſpecially to the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60708:21"/>
religious Emiſſaries who are God's
Ambaſſadors.</p>
                        <p>He experiences ſo many marks of
kindneſs from you, as makes him
ready to offer the moſt ſuitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns,
to keep a continual correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with you, to entertain and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
a Commerce with Your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
but eſpecially to begin an Union
between the two Crowns, which will
be the more famous to poſterity, by
Your Countrey's lying ſo diſtant
from His, by the vaſt Seas which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
them.</p>
                        <p>But nothing will ſo much keep
Him in this reſolution, and more
unite Him to You, than to live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

                        <p>And this is, Sir, what the King

a Prince, and who has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
failed in his Advice to the Kings
his Allies, has eſpecially enjoined me
to recommend to You.</p>
                        <p>He conjures you, as one of his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cereſt
Friends, and by the Intereſt
which he has in your Wellfare, to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60708:21"/>
conſider that this ſupreme Majeſty
with which You are endued on earth,
can come onely from the true God,
that is to ſay, from a Being Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Eternal and Incomprehenſible,
ſuch as the Chriſtians acknowledge,
by whom alone Kings do reign, and
who ſubdueth the People that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them. Submit Your Greatneſs to
this God, who governs Heaven and
Earth; this is what's far more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
than to adore Idols, ſo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary
in this Countrey, of whoſe
inſignificany Your Majeſty's Great
Judgment cannot chuſe but be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

are ready to ſerve You.</p>
                        <p>The beſt news, Sir, I can carry

Your Majeſty being convinced of the
reality of what I ſay, has made far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
enquiries into the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and given Your Name up to
it; and what Honour will this bring

give to Your Eſtates, and what
Happineſs will it lead You to at

of His Majeſty, and all the Royal Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and whether the King had made any
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60708:22"/>
Conqueſt of late, I told him he had
gained <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> an impregnable
place, and the moſt conſiderable the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> held in that Countrey, which
ſhut up the Frontiers of <hi>France,</hi> and
opened a way to thoſe who might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
his Enemies, and that he had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
agreed to a Peace with all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
when at the Head of his Armies.
The King replied, he was glad of our
King's Victories, and the Peace he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed;
he added he had ſent Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
to <hi>France,</hi> who embarked at <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam,</hi>
in the <hi>Riſing Sun;</hi> that he would
ſeek all ways to give the King ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
in every thing I offered him:
The Biſhop of <hi>Metellopolis</hi> was preſent,
who interpreted ſeveral Queſtions the
King made me. This Monarch had a
Crown enriched with Diamonds, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened
on a Cap, which ſtood up above
the Crown like almoſt to our Dragoons,
his Veſt was of a very rich flowered
Stuff, wrought with Gold, and embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
at the Neck and Sleeves with Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,
which lookt like a kind of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and Bracelets. He had a great many
Diamond Rings on his fingers; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60708:23"/>
ſay what kind of Shoes or Stocking
he had on, having onely in this Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
ſeen half his Body. He had four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
<hi>Mandarins</hi> in his Parlor, where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
was, all proſtrate on the ground, and
who never left this poſture all this
while.</p>
            <p>The King is about fifty five years of
age, well ſhaped, ſomewhat tanned,
as all of thoſe Countreys are, having
a chearfull countenance; his inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are Royal, he is couragious, a great
Politician, governing alone, magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
liberal, a Lover of Arts, in a
word, a Prince, who by his Wit has
freed himſelf from diverſe Cuſtomer
which he found in his Kingdom, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing
of ſtrange Countreys, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of <hi>Europe,</hi> whatſoever he thought
might moſt contribute to the Honour
and Happineſs of his Reign.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Mandarins,</hi> whom I now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
had neither Shoes nor Stoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,
and were apparelled like thoſe I
have heretofore ſpoke of, with Caps,
like the King's, and each of them had a
Box, wherein he put his <hi>Betel, Arreck,</hi>
and Tobacco. By theſe Boxes a Man
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60708:23"/>
may diſtinguiſh their Qualities and
Ranks, ſome differing from others. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fter
the King had diſcourſed with me an
hour, he ſhut his Window, and I reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
The place of Audience was about
twelve or fifteen ſteps high, 'twas fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
painted within with flowers of Gold,
from the top to the bottom, the Floor
was covered with rich Tapeſtry; at
the end of this Parlor there were two
pair of large Stairs on each hand, which
led into the Chamber where the King
was, in the middle of theſe two pair of
Stairs are Windows to which you muſt
go up ſome ſteps, before which there
were three great Umbrella's, they were
of Cloth of Gold, and their Sticks
painted with Gold, one was in the
middle of the Window, and the two
others on both ſides, 'tis through this
Window we ſaw the King's Throne,
and through which he gave me Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Mr. <hi>Conſtans</hi> carried me after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to view the reſt of the Palace,
where I ſaw the white Elephant, who
ate and drank out of Gold, I ſaw alſo
others, very fine ones, after which I
returned to my Lodging in the ſame
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60708:24"/>
Pomp wherein I came, which Houſe was
well enough, and all my retinue were
well accommodated in it. I was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that Mr. <hi>Conſtans</hi> had given order
from the King to all the <hi>Mandarins</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
foreign Nations that dwell in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
to come to theſe Lodgings and
being there he told them the King was
minded they ſhould ſee in what diſtinct
manner he treated the Ambaſſadours
of <hi>France,</hi> and thoſe of other Nations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
This diſtinction being due to the King
of <hi>France,</hi> a moſt mighty Monarch, and
who knew to requite the Civilities
ſhewed him. Theſe <hi>Mandarins</hi> were
aſtoniſhed, and anſwered, they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſeen an Ambaſſadour from <hi>France,</hi>
and were perſuaded that the ſingular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
which the King gave him was
due to the Character of ſo great a
Prince, ſeeing his Victories have long
ſince been known to the remoteſt parts
of the World; and therefore they were
not ſurpriſed at the King's diſtinction.
At the ſame time Mr. <hi>Conſtans</hi> ordered
them from the King to come and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:60708:24"/>

            <p>On the ninteenth there came a great

Mr. <hi>Conſtans</hi> with a Preſent of Fruits,

            <p>The ſame day the Biſhop of <hi>Metello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis</hi>

the King's cuſtome being to preſent at

Cloaths after the faſhion of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey:
But as for my part I made no new
Cloaths, and there were onely the

At night being accompained by the

the Court of the Palace a Combat, or to
ſpeak better, an Elephant fight, for
the Elephants were tyed by the two
hind feet, on each of them rode two
men, who held in their hands a crook
with which they governed them, as
Horſes are managed by a bridle, they
ſtruck them ſeveral times to animate
them, and the Elephants had fought
well no queſtion, had they had liberty,
they onely gave one another blows
with their teeth and trunks; the King
was there preſent, but I did not ſee
him: We paſt through this Court into
ſeveral others, and afterwards came
into the <hi>Pagod,</hi> the Portal appeared
to be ancient and well wrought, the
whole building indifferent handſome,
and of the form of our Churches in
<hi>Europe;</hi> we ſaw ſeveral Statues of Braſs
gilt which ſeemed to offer ſacrifices
to a great Idol all of Gold, about
forty foot high, on the ſide of which
Idol, there were ſeveral other ſmall
ones, ſome of which being alſo of
Gold, had lighted Lamps faſtned
into them, from the top to the bottom
of them. At the end of this <hi>Pagod,</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:60708:26"/>
there is another great Idol on a ſtately
Tombeſtone: I afterwards went into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<hi>Pagod</hi> adjoyning to the firſt,
and I paſt under into a Vault like a
Cloiſter, where there were Idols on
each hand gilded, who had each o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
them a Lamp burning before them,
which the <hi>Talapoins,</hi> which are the
Prieſts of <hi>Siam,</hi> do light every night.
In this <hi>Pagod</hi> was the Tomb of the
deceaſed Queen who died about four
or five years ſince; 'tis magnificent
enough, and behind this Tomb, was
another of this preſent King's Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor's,
repreſented by a great Statue
lying on one ſide and dreſt as Kings
are wont to be in days of Ceremony;
this Statue is about twenty five foot
long, 'twas of Braſs gilt; I went far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into other places where there
were a great many of theſe Statues,
both of Gold and Silver: ſeveral had
rich Dimond Rings and Rubies on their
fingers; I never ſaw ſo many Images
and ſo much Gold.</p>
            <p>I afterwards went to ſee the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants,
there is a great number of
them, and who are of a prodigious
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60708:26"/>
ſize. I ſaw a piece of Cannon, caſt
at <hi>Siam,</hi> of eighteen foot long, and
that would carry bullets of three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pound weight; there is a great
many Cannons which they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The thirty firſt was a day of rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
for the King of <hi>Portugal</hi>'s coming
to the Crown, which was ſolemniſed
by the letting off the great Guns and
ſeveral ſhews of Fire-works from on
board the <hi>Portugal</hi> Veſſels.</p>
            <p>The next morning being the firſt of
<hi>November,</hi> Mr. <hi>Conſtans</hi> invited me to a
great Feaſt, which was made as a farther
continuation of the former Solemnity,
to which I went, and all the Europeans
in the Town, the Guns ceaſed not
from firing all that day: after Dinner
there was a Comedy, the <hi>Chianoiſes</hi>
began the Poſtures, there were <hi>Siamoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
in it, but I knew not what they
ſaid, their geſtures ſeemed to me ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
and far unlike thoſe amongſt us;
yet there were two men, who aſcended
to the top of two Perches which were
hung very high, which had at their
end a little Apple, and ſtanding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60708:27"/>
on the top of them, they ſhewed
ſeveral ſtrange tricks. Afterwards we
had a kind of Puppet play, which
yielded ſmall diverſion.</p>
            <p>On the fourth being Sunday Mr. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtans</hi>
told me that the King was to go
to the <hi>Pagod,</hi> where he is wont to go
every year, and prayed me to ſee him
paſs by. I went with him and all my
Attendance; and having remained
there a while, there appeared a great
gilded Barge, in which was a <hi>Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi>
who came to ſee whether all things
were in order: ſcarcely was he paſt by,
but I ſaw ſeveral Barges wherein were
the <hi>Mandarins</hi> of the firſt rank, who
were all of them in Suits of red cloath;
they are wont on theſe ſolemn days to
be all cloathed with the ſame colour,
and 'tis the King who nominates it;
they had white Bonnets on, very high
crown'd, and the <hi>Oyas</hi> had at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of their Caps a golden Fringe,
as to their Breeches, 'twas a kind of
Scarf, as I already ſaid. After them
came thoſe of the ſecond rank, the Life
Guards, ſeveral Souldiers, and then the
King in a Barge attended with two
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60708:27"/>
others which were very fine ones; the
Watermen were apparelled like the
Souldiers, but onely they had a kind
of breaſt and back-plates, and each
of them an helmet on their heads,
which is ſaid to be of Gold; their <hi>Pagais</hi>
or Sculs were gilt with Gold, as all
the Barges were, which ſhewed very
fine; there were an hundred and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
and five Rowers in each of theſe
Barges, and in thoſe of the <hi>Mandarins</hi>
about an hundred, and an hundred and
twenty; there were Guards that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and ſeveral other <hi>Mandarins</hi> who
made the rear Guard; the King was
richly Apparelled with ſeveral pretious
Stones, I ſaluted him in paſſing by, and
he returned my complement, his Train
conſiſted of an hundred and forty ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Barges, which appeared very finely
indeed on the water, marching all in
good order. After Dinner I went
into my Barge to ſee the reſt of the
Ceremony, at night the King changed
his Barge, and propoſed a prize to
that Barge that ſhould firſt arrive by
force of Oars to the Palace, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
was one of the party, and he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60708:28"/>
by much before the others, ſo
that his Rowers won the money; I know
not how great 'twas, the other Barges
paſt on very ſwiftly, all the River was
covered with them who came to ſee
the King; that day being deſigned for
his ſhewing himſelf to his People, I
believe there were an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
to ſee him.</p>
            <p>At night there were Fire-works for
joy of the Coronation of the King of
<hi>England,</hi> the whole affair was well
carried on, and ſtrange Veſſels fired
from all parts their Cannon.</p>
            <p>On the fifth this Feaſt continued,
and the Cannon was fired from all
parts of the Town, Mr. <hi>Conſtans</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
me to Dinner, where all the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans
were, where I was made very
welcome.</p>
            <p>On the eighth the King parted for
<hi>Louvo,</hi> which is a Countrey Seat where
he generally remains for eight or nine
months in the year, it being diſtant
twenty Leagues from <hi>Siam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the fifteenth I parted for that
place, I lay in the way at a Houſe
which was built for me, 'twas in the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60708:28"/>
ſame form as that where I had been
Lodged all along, 'twas near where the
King lyes when he goes to <hi>Louvo.</hi> I
remained there all the ſixteenth, and
on the ſeventeenth ſet out thither,
where I arrived the ſame day on eight
at night, I found this Houſe of the
King's built after the Mooriſh faſhion,
and a man may juſtly praiſe the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;
in your entrance to it you muſt
paſs through a Garden, where there
are ſeveral Conduits, in this Garden
you aſcend five or ſix ſteps, and you
go to a kind of Summer-houſe ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very high where you take the Air,
I found a very fine Chapel, and a
Lodging for all thoſe who attended
me.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Munday</hi> the ninteenth the King
gave me a particular Audience, after
Dinner I went abroad to take the Air
on Elephants, whoſe goings are very
uneaſie and incommodious, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ride ten Leagues on Horſe back
than one on theſe animals.</p>
            <p>On the twenty third Mr. <hi>Conſtans</hi>
told me the King would give me the
divertiſement of a combat of Elephants,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60708:29"/>
and entreated me to bring along with
me the Captains who had conducted
me to ſhew them the ſport, who were
the Sieurs de <hi>Vaudricourt</hi> and <hi>Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euſe;</hi>
we went thither on Elephants,
and the Fight was carried on after
the ſame manner as that which I above
related.</p>
            <p>The King ſent for the Captains and
told them, he was very glad they were
the King of <hi>France</hi>'s firſt Captains
who came into his Kingdom, and he
wiſht them as happy a return as their
arrival was. He gave each of them
a Scimitar, whoſe handle and guard
was of Gold, and the ſheaths almoſt
covered with the ſame metal, a golden
Chain curiouſly wrought and very large,
a Veſt of cloth of Gold with Gold
buttons; as Mr. de <hi>Vaudricourt</hi> was
the chief Captain, ſo his Preſent was
richer and better, the King gave him
notice to have a care of their Enemies
by the way, they anſwered that his
Majeſty furniſht them with arms to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themſelves, and that they would
acquit themſelves of their duty. Theſe
Captains ſpake to him without light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60708:29"/>
off their Elephants; I ſaw very
well that under pretence of a combat
of Elephants, he was minded to make
theſe Preſents in the ſight of ſeveral
Europeans who were preſent, to give
a publick mark of the particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
he would make of the <hi>French</hi>
Nation: The King afterwards returned,
and I went to ſee an Elephant which
had been brought by the females who
are inſtructed to go into the woods
with a man or two to conduct them,
as far as twenty five or thirty Leagues
to ſeek wild Elephants, and when
they have found any, they ſo order it
as to draw them on to a place near
the Town deſigned to receive them;
'tis a great ſpace dug in the earth,
and ſurrounded by a wall of Brick very
high, there is alſo a ſecond incloſure
about fifteen foot high, through which
a man may eaſily paſs, and a double
gate of the ſame height, which ſhuts
of it ſelf by means of a pully, ſo that
when an Elephant is within, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
get out. The female Elephants
do firſt enter, the wild ones follow
them, and they are faſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:60708:30"/>
This ſame day Mr. <hi>Conſtans</hi> preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the two Captains with ſeveral fine
wrought Japon works of Silver and
other Curioſities.</p>
            <p>On Saturday the twenty fourth I
got on horſeback to go ſee the wild
Elephants taken.</p>
            <p>The King being come to the end
of this place which is encloſed as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
ſaid, there entred a man who
went with a ſtaff to attack the wild
Elephant, who at the ſame time left
the females, and purſued him, the man
continued this management, and thus
buſied this wild Elephant, till the
females who were with him got out
of the place by the gate, which was
immediately ſhut after them, and the
Elephant ſeeing himſelf left alone im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned,
grew inraged; the fellow ſet
upon him again, and inſtead of flying
on that ſide which he was wont, he
ran out of the gate, and the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
followed him, and when he was
between the two gates he was ſhut in,
and being hot they threw a great deal
of water on him to refreſh him, and
there were ſeveral Elephants brought
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60708:30"/>
to him, who careſſed him with their
trunks, to comfort him as it were;
they tyed his two hind legs, and the
gate was opened to him, he marched
five or ſix paces, and found four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants
of War, and one to confront him,
two others who were faſtned to his ſides,
and one behind him to puſh him with
his head; they brought them in this
manner into a kind of Stable ground,
where there was a great ſtake faſtned,
to which he was tyed, and two Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants
were placed on each ſide of him
to bear him company, and the others
are led away. When the wild Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants
have remained fifteen days,
in this manner, they know them who
were wont to feed them, and follow
them, and afterwards they become as
tractable as the others. The King
has a great many of theſe females
who do nothing elſe but decoy theſe
wild ones.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Munday</hi> the twenty fifth I went
to ſee a Tyger fight with three Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants,
but the Tyger was not the
ſtrongeſt, he received a blow with a
tooth that carried a way half his jaw,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60708:31"/>
although the Tyger was not wanting
in courage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday</hi> the twenty ſixth I had a
particular Audience, this being the
fourth time, and the King ſhewed me
the eſteem he had for the French Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
after ſeveral other diſcourſes,
of which I have given the King an
account. At night I went to ſee a
Feaſt, which the <hi>Siamoiſes</hi> celebrate at
the beginning of their year, which is
attended with great lights. It's perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in the Palace, in a great Court,
round about which there are ſeveral
boxes full of Lamps, and before theſe
boxes there are a great many perches
drove into the ground, along which
hang ſeveral horn Lanthorns prettily
painted, this Feaſt laſts eight days.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Sunday</hi> the ſecond of <hi>September,</hi>
Mr <hi>Conſtans</hi> ſent me a Preſent, he did
the ſame alſo to the Abbat of <hi>Choiſy,</hi>
and the Gentlemen which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
me; the Preſents were Bracelets,
<hi>China</hi> Cabinets, night Gowns and Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
works made of Silver Bezoarſtones,
Rhinocero's horns, and other curioſities
of that Countrey.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:60708:31"/>
On the tenth I went to ſee the great
hunting of Elephants, which is in this
following form: The King ſent a
great number of female Elephants all
in a company together, and when they
have been ſeveral days in the wood,
and he is informed they have found
Elephants, he ſends thirty or forty
thouſand men, who make a great
ring in the place where the Elephants
are; they poſt themſelves ſeveral foot
diſtance one from another, and each
company has a fire about three foot
high or thereabouts: there is alſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ring of Elephants of War, diſtant
from one another about an hundred and
an hundred and fifty paces, and in thoſe
places where the Elephants may more
eaſily paſs thorough, the Elephants of
War are more numerous; in ſeveral
places there is Cannon which is fired
at the wild Elephants when they will
force a paſſage, for they are in great
fear of fire: every day this incloſure
or ring is leſſoned and at length 'tis
very ſmall, and the ſtres are alſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed.
Theſe Elephants hearing a
noiſe about them, dare not fly, although
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60708:32"/>
now and then one or two do eſcape,
for I was told that ſome days paſt
there were ten got away. When they
are to be taken they are made to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into a place ſurrounded with ſtakes,
where there are ſome trees, through
which a man may eaſily paſs, there is
alſo another ring of Elephants of War
and Souldiers, among which there are
men mounted on Elephants, who dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly
throw cords at the Elephants
hind feet, who when they are faſtned
are brought between two tame Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants,
beſides which there is another
who tends on him behind, if need be
to puſh him forward, ſo he is obliged
to march, and when he is unruly, the
others ſtrike him with their trunks;
they bring him into a kind of ſtable
open on all ſides, where they are
faſtned and managed as I have already
related: I ſaw ten taken, and I was
told there were a hundred and forty
in the ring; the King was there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
and gave orders for what was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.
In this place I had the honour
to have a long conference with him,
and he prayed me to leave Mr. <hi>Fourbin,</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:60708:32"/>
the Leiutenant of my Ship with him,
which I agreed to, and preſented him,
and at the ſame time the King gave him
a Semitar, whoſe Handle and Guard was
of Gold, and the Sheath ſtudded with the
ſame, with a Juſtaucorp of embroide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Satin with Gold Buttons. Then the
King preſented me with a Golden Cup,
and gave me a Collation in a Grove,
where I had excellent Wine and Fruit.</p>
            <p>The next morning being the eleventh
I returned to this game, being moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on an Elephant, the King was there,
and ſent two <hi>Mandarins</hi> to me, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
me to come to him, he ſpake ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
things to me, and entreated me to
leave Mr. <hi>de la Mare</hi> the Engineer, who
came along with me behind me, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
ſome places in his Countrey. I told
him I did not doubt but the King my
Maſter would be content I ſhould leave
him, ſeeing His Majeſty's Intereſts were
as dear to him as his own; I thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ordered Monſr. <hi>de la Mare,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
with the King, who gave to him
a Veſt of Stuff of Gold. The King told
me, he would ſend a little Elephant to
the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> which he ſhewed
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60708:33"/>
me, and having a while thought on
it, he ſaid that if he ſhould give one
onely to the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
leſt the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> ſhould take
it ill, and therefore he would ſend two,
and I deſigning to part the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to go on board, I preſented the
Gentlemen to him who were with me,
to take leave of his Majeſty, the King
wiſht them a good Voyage. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
would have preſented to him <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieurs,</hi>
the Abbat <hi>de Lionne,</hi> and <hi>le Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,</hi>
Miſſionaries, to take their leave
of him, but he told the Biſhop, that
as to thoſe two perſons, they were of
his Family, and that he reſpected them
as his Children, and that they ſhould
take their leave of him in his Caſtle:
afterwards the King retired, and I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
on him to the end of the Wood,
taking the way of <hi>Louvo,</hi> becauſe the
King had a Houſe in the Wood, where
he uſually tarries whilſt he is buſied in
this Game of Elephants.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> the twelfth, the King
gave me Audience of Leave, the Biſhop
was there, he was pleaſed to ſay he
was very well ſatisfied with me and my
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60708:33"/>
Negotiation; he gave me a great gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Veſſel which they call a Boſs, and
this is one of the moſt honourable
marks of the King's Favour; he told
me he would not have the accuſtomed
Ceremonies about it, becauſe there
might be ſomething which would not
pleaſe me by reaſon of the Genufle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xions
which the greateſt of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
are obliged to make on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.
There is no Stranger in his
Court, excepting the King of <hi>Camboye</hi>'s
Nephew, who has received the like
Mark of Honour, which ſignifies that
one is an <hi>Oyas,</hi> a Dignity in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
comparable to a Duke in <hi>France;</hi>
there are ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Oyas,</hi> which
are diſtinguiſhed by their Boſſes. This
Monarch had the goodneſs to tell me
ſeveral things in ſuch an obliging man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that I dare not relate them; and in
all my Voyage I received ſuch great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
that I ſhould ſcarce be believed,
were they not ſole due to the Character
His Majeſty has been pleaſed to honour
me with: I received alſo a thouſand
Civilities from his Miniſters, and the
reſt of his Court. <hi>Meſſieurs</hi> the Abbat
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60708:34"/>
of <hi>Lionne,</hi> and <hi>le Vacher,</hi> took at the
ſame time their leaves of the King,
who having wiſht them a good Voyage,
gave each of them a golden Crucifix,
the Foot of it being Silver. At the
end of the Audience, Monſr. <hi>Conſtans</hi>
carried me into a Parlor, ſurrounded
with Water-ſpouts which was in the
Palace, where I found a Table very
well ſpread, after the manner of the
Kingdom of <hi>Siam:</hi> The King had the
goodneſs to ſend me two or three
Diſhes from His Table, for he dined
at the ſame time; about five of the
Clock I went into a gilt Chair, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
by ten Men, and the Gentlemen
who accompanied me rode on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
we entred into our Barks, and
were attended by a great many <hi>Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins,</hi>
the Streets were lined with Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
Elephants, and Mooriſh Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers.
'Twas the ſame alſo in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
when I had my laſt Audience; all
the <hi>Mandarins</hi> that accompanied me to
my Barge, went into theirs, and came
with me; there were about an hundred
Barges, and I arrived the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
being the thirteenth, at <hi>Siam,</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:60708:34"/>
about three in the morning. The King
of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Letter, and his Ambaſſadors
for <hi>France,</hi> were with me, in a very
ſtately Barge attended by ſeveral others.
The King made me ſeveral Preſents,
amongſt which was a crucifix, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of which is Gold, a Croſs of <hi>Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacq,</hi>
which is a metal more eſteemed
than Gold in that Countrey, with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
other Curioſities of the <hi>Indies;</hi> and
the Cuſtome of theſe Countries being
to gratifie thoſe who bring the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents,
I gave to the Steers-men of the
King's Barges about eight or nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Piſtols. As to Monſr. <hi>Conſtans,</hi> I
took the Liberty to give him a piece of
Houſhold-ſtuff, which I had brought
along with me from <hi>France,</hi> and to
Madam his Wife, ſeveral Preſents, to
the value of an hundred and fifty Piſtols;
the King alſo gave Preſents to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of ſeven or eight hundred Piſtols to
the Abbat <hi>de Choiſy</hi> in <hi>China</hi> Cabinets,
<hi>Japon</hi> Works, and other Indian Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſities.</p>
            <p>On the fourteenth, at five of the
Clock at night, I parted from <hi>Siam,</hi>
accompanied by Mr. <hi>Conſtans;</hi> ſeveral
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60708:35"/>
               <hi>Mandarins,</hi> and a great many Barges,
and arrived at <hi>Bancoc</hi> the next morning,
the Forts by the way, and thoſe of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coc,</hi>
ſaluted me with all their Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
I remained a day at <hi>Bancoc,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the King had told me in an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
that being a Soldier, he deſired
me I would view the Fortifications of
it; and to tell his Servants what it
wanted, and to pitch on a place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to build a Church; I drew a ſmall
draught, and gave it to Monſr. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the ſixteenth in the morning I
parted thence accompanied by <hi>Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins,</hi>
the Forts ſaluted me, and at four
of the Clock I arrived at the Bar of
<hi>Siam,</hi> in the Shalops belonging to the
King's Ships, on board of which I went
about ſeven of the Clock.</p>
            <p>On the ſeventeenth the King of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>'s
Frigat, in which were the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors,
came and caſt Anchor near my
Ship; I ſent my Shalop, which brought
two of the Ambaſſadors, and I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſent back the ſame Shalop, which
brought the other Ambaſſador, and
the King's Letter, which was written
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60708:35"/>
on a Leaf of Gold, rowled up, and put
into a Gold Box; we ſaluted the Letter
with the firing of ſeveral pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
'twas laid on a Table, with a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopy
over it, and when the <hi>Mandarins</hi>

This Father has moreover much aſſiſted
me, as alſo the Gentlemen which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied

our Voyage a conſiderable part of the

the great qualities of Mr. the Biſhop of

Miſſionaries in the Eaſt, ſeeing that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Cuſtome, they will not
fail to give the publick a full relation
of what concerns Religion in thoſe
Countreys. I ſhould have great ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to have met there with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
the Biſhop of <hi>Heliopolis;</hi> the King
of <hi>Siam</hi> told me one day what Joy
'twould have been to him, to have ſeen
an Ambaſſador in that Countrey from
<hi>France;</hi> but it did not pleaſe God to
give us that conſolation, and we were
informed that he had ended in <hi>China</hi> his
laborious Pilgrimage.</p>
            <p>But before we relate our Arrival at

to give an Account here of what I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60708:39"/>
(during that ſmall time I was

            <p>EVery day the <hi>Mandarins,</hi> whoſe
place it is to do Juſtice, meet

they enter with their Petition in their
Hands.</p>

Strangers, who have any complaint
concerning Traffick, offer it to the
<hi>Barcalon,</hi> who is the King's Chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,
and determins all Affairs about
Commerce, and the occaſions of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
in his abſence, his uſual Deputy
does it, and in both their abſences a
kind of Aldermen. There is an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
appointed to ſee after the Taxes,
and others for other matters. When
Affairs have been examined, an account
thereof is given to the Officers within
the Palace, who relate the ſame to the
King, ſitting then on a high Throne,
all the <hi>Mandarins</hi> proſtrate themſelves
with their Faces on the Ground; and
the <hi>Barcalon,</hi> or others of the Chief
<hi>Oyas,</hi> acquaint the King with the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair,
and their Judgments thereupon,
which he confirms or alters according
to his Will, and this extends to the
chief buſineſſes, but he oft cauſes mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to be brought into the Palace, and
ſends his pleaſure in Writing.</p>
            <p>The King is a moſt abſolute Prince,
and a Man may ſay him to be the <hi>Sia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſes</hi>
God; they dare not call him by
his Name. He puniſhes moſt ſeverely
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60708:40"/>
the ſmalleſt Crime, for his Subjects
muſt be governed in a ſtrict manner;
he ſometimes makes uſe of Souldiers of
his Guard to puniſh the guilty, when
their Crime is extraordinary, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
proved. Thoſe who are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
employed in theſe ſort of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions,
are an hundred and fifty Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
or thereabout, who have their
Armes painted from the Shoulder to
their Wriſts; the common puniſhment
is thirty, forty, fifty or more ſtripes
on the Shoulders of the Criminal, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the greatneſs of the Crime;
others are peckt into the head with a
ſharp pointed Iron: as to Accomplices
in a fault worthy of Death, after the
Head has been cut off from a real Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal,
'tis tied about the Neck of the
Confederate, and is left expoſed to the
Sun for three days and three nights,
which gives a moſt filthy ſtink to him
that carries it.</p>
            <p>In this Kingdom the Law <hi>Talionis</hi> is
in great uſe, the worſt puniſhment was,
not long ago, to condemn Malefactours
to the River, which is ſuch another
kind of puniſhment as the Gallies, or
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60708:41"/>
rather worſe; but now they are puniſht
with Death. The King minds building
more than any of his Predeceſſours, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
the Walls of Towns, raiſing
up <hi>Pagodes,</hi> and adorning his Palace,
building Houſes for Foreigners, and
Ships after the European Faſhion; he
is very kind to Strangers, retaining ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of them in his Service, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of more.</p>
            <p>The Kings of <hi>Siam</hi> were not wont to
let themſelves be ſeen as this does; they
lived always alone, but this preſent
King lives like others; but Monſr. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithe,</hi>
an Apoſtolick Vicar, made uſe
of a certain <hi>Brame,</hi> who being a kind
of Boufon, had great liberty of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to this Monarch, by whoſe means
he gave the Prince to underſtand the
Power and Manner of the Government
of our great Monarch, and alſo the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
of all the Kings in <hi>Europe;</hi> ſo
that he being a Man of Senſe, as I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
obſerved, he thought fit to ſend
for Monſieur <hi>Berithe,</hi> and afterwards
ſeveral others: ſince which time he is
become very affable, and acceſſible to
Strangers. Thoſe who adminiſter Juſtice

Offices, <hi>Oyas Obrat, Oyas Momrat, Oyas
Campeng, Oyas Ricchou, Oyas Shaynan,
Opran Olvan, Oeun, Omun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heretofore when the Kings would
not let themſelves be ſeen, the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
did what they pleaſed, but the
preſent King who wants not Judgment,
and is a great Politician, will be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of nothing; he has ſixt to him
Mr. <hi>Conſtans</hi> of whom I have ſeveral
times ſpoken. He is a Greek by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
a perſon of great vivacity of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and extraordinary prudence, he
can and does do all things under the
King's authority in the Kingdom, but
this Miniſter would never accept of
any great office which the King has
offered him ſeveral times. The <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calon</hi>
who died about two years ſince,
and who by right of his place had the
management of all affairs of State, was
a perſon of great abilities, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
himſelf well in his employments,
and was greatly beloved, he that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
him was a <hi>Malais</hi> by nation,
which is a Countrey near to <hi>Siam,</hi> he
made great uſe of Mr. <hi>Bacon</hi> an Engliſh
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60708:42"/>
man to bring the King into an ill opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Mr. <hi>Conſtans,</hi> and render him
ſuſpected, but the King underſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>od the
others malice, cauſed him to be cudgeled
to death, and diſpoſſeſſed him of his
office; he that enjoys it at preſent
lives in good intelligence with Mr.
<hi>Conſtans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As by the Laws introduced by the
Prieſts, who are called <hi>Talopoins,</hi> 'tis not
allowable to kill, ſo Malefactors were
heretofore condemned to the chain, or
led into ſome Deſerts to periſh there
with hunger, whereas this preſent King
cauſes their heads to be ſtruck off,
and throws them to Elephants.</p>
            <p>The King has ſpies to know whether
matters of any importance are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
from him, he moſt ſeverely
chaſtiſes thoſe, who abuſe their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
Every ſtrange Nation eſtabliſhed
in the Kingdom of <hi>Siam</hi> has particular
Officers, and the King takes of all theſe
Nations perſons which he makes gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Officers throughout all his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
There are many <hi>Chinoiſes</hi> in
his Countrey; there were heretofore
many Moors, but ſome years paſt he
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60708:42"/>
diſcovered ſo many foul treacheries
amongſt them, ſuch frauds and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
that he has baniſh'd moſt of
them out of his Countrey.</p>
            <p>The commerce of ſtrange Merchants
was heretofore very conſiderable; but
ſince ſome years, the various revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which have happened in <hi>China,
Japon</hi> and other parts of the Indies,
have diſcouraged all Trade. Yet 'tis
hoped, ſeeing all theſe diſturbances
are quieted, Trade will flouriſh again;
and that the King of <hi>Siam</hi> by means
of his Miniſter will ſend his Ships to
take in the moſt pretious commodities
in all the Eaſtern Countries, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
all things to their firſt ſtate.</p>
            <p>They make War after a different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
from moſt Nations, driving their
Enemies out of their places, without
doing them any farther harm than the
making them ſlaves; and if they bear
Arms, it ſeems rather they intend to
affright them by ſhooting on the ground
or up into the air, than to kill them,
and if they doe, 'tis rather out of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
than by their good-wills; but this
happens ſeldom, becauſe all their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60708:43"/>
follow the ſame method. There
are Companies and Regiments who are
detached from the reſt during the night,
who go into the Enemies Villages, and
lead away all the Inhabitants captives,
as well Women as Children; the King
gives them Lands and Buffalo's to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate
them, and when the King has
need he makes uſe of them. Theſe
late years, the King has made War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the revolted <hi>Cambogions,</hi> aſſiſted
by the <hi>Chinoiſes</hi> and <hi>Cochinnoiſes,</hi> where
he was forced to fight in earneſt, and
there were ſeveral Souldiers killed on
both ſides: He has had ſeveral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
that are Europeans, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
them to fight after our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>Before this War there was a great
commerce between their States, and
that of <hi>Siam</hi> drew great advantages by
the great quantities of Gold, Musk,
Elephants teeth and other Merchandiſes
which came from <hi>Laos</hi> in exchange for
Linen and other Goods.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Siam</hi> is ſtill at wars
with the King of <hi>Pegu,</hi> he has ſeveral
Slaves of this Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:60708:43"/>
There are People of ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
in his Kingdom, the Moors were
in great abundance, as I already ſaid,
but now ſeveral of them are fled into
the Kingdom of <hi>Colconde,</hi> who were in
the King's ſervice, and have carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with them above twenty thouſand
<hi>Catis,</hi> each <hi>Catis</hi> being worth fifty
Crowns: The King of <hi>Siam</hi> wrote to the
King of <hi>Colconde</hi> to ſend him back thoſe
Fugitives, or oblige them to pay the
Sum, but the King would not liſten to
the propoſal, which has put the King
of <hi>Siam</hi> on proclaiming a War againſt
him, and taking a Ship at the time
when I was at <hi>Siam</hi> belonging to him,
whoſe lading is valued at an hundred
thouſand Crowns. There are ſix Frigats
commanded by Engliſh and French, who
cruiſe on thoſe Coaſt.</p>
            <p>Of late the Emperour of <hi>China</hi> has
given leave to all Strangers to come
and Negotiate in his Kingdom; this
permiſſion is onely for five years, but
'tis hoped it will be continued, ſeeing
'tis of great advantage to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:60708:44"/>
The King of <hi>Siam</hi> has a great many
<hi>Malais</hi> in his Kingdom, they are Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans,
but good Souldiers, yet their
Religion differs much from the Moors.
The <hi>Pegorans</hi> are as numerous in this
Countrey as the originary <hi>Siamoiſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are alſo a great many <hi>Laoiſes,</hi>
eſpecially towards the North. Here
are alſo eight or nine Families of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<hi>Portuguiſes,</hi> but of thoſe which
are called <hi>Meſties</hi> above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,
that is to ſay, thoſe who are

            <p>The Dutch have there onely one
Factory.</p>

            <p>The French alſo.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cochinnoiſes</hi> are about an hundred
Families, moſt Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the <hi>Tonquinoiſes</hi> there are
ſeven or eight Chriſtian Families.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Malaiſes</hi> are in great numbers,
who are moſt of them ſlaves, and who
conſequently do not make a body.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Macaſſars,</hi> and ſeveral of the
People of the Iſle of <hi>Java</hi> are there
eſtabliſh'd, as alſo the Moors; under
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60708:44"/>
the Name of theſe laſt are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Turks, Perſians, Moguls, Colcondoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
and thoſe of <hi>Bengala.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Armenians</hi> make a ſeparate
body, they are fifteen or ſixteen Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
all Chriſtians, the greateſt part
of them are Horſemen of the King's
Guard.</p>
            <p>As to the manners of the <hi>Siamoiſes,</hi>
they are a People very docible, which
proceeds rather from their nature,
which deſires quiet, than any other
cauſe; and therefore the <hi>Talapoins,</hi>
who make profeſſion of this apparent
vertue, forbid the killing of all ſorts
of animals, yet when any others kill
Pullets or Ducks, they eat their fleſh,
without troubling themſelves who did
the murther, or wherefore they were
killed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Siamoiſes</hi> are generally chaſte,
having but one Wife, but the rich Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
ſuch as the <hi>Mandarins</hi> have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines,
who remain ſhut up all their
lives. The people are truſty, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

The <hi>Malaiſes</hi> who are very numerous

            <p>The <hi>Laoiſes</hi> people the fourth part
of the Kingdom of <hi>Siam,</hi> and being
one half <hi>Chinoiſes,</hi> they partake of their
manners, their craft and inclinations to
ſhirk handſomely; their Women are
white and not ugly, very ſociable and
conſequently perilous. In the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Laos,</hi> a man that meets a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

offend her.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Siamoiſes</hi> as well Officers as
<hi>Mandarins,</hi> are generally rich, for they
ſpend hardly any thing, the King gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them Servants, who are obliged
to maintain themſelves at their own
coſt, being as it were ſlaves, they are

under an obligation to ſerve them for
nothing half a year; and theſe Maſters
having many of them, they make uſe
of one part whilſt the other reſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but thoſe who do not ſerve them,
pay them every year a ſum of money;
their Victuals are cheap, it being onely
Rice, Fiſh, and little Fleſh, and there's
great. plenty of this in the Countrey;
their Cloaths laſt them long, being
entire pieces of Stuff, which do not ſo
ſoon were out as our Apparel, and
coſt very little. Moſt of the <hi>Siamoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
are Bricklayers, or Carpenters, and
there are very good workmen amongſt
them, exactly imitating the curious
Works of <hi>Europe.</hi> As to Painting, they
are in a manner ignorant of the uſe of
it, there are Carved works in their
<hi>Pagodes,</hi> and their Tombs are well
poliſhed, and very ſtately.</p>
            <p>They colour finely with Lime, which
they ſoak in water which they draw
out of a Tree, found in the Foreſts,
which makes it ſo laſting, that it dures

Their Religion to ſpeak properly,

as that of giving them Money: They
have Laws, which they ſtrictly obſerve,

their good works is the hope of a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py

a Hell, where great enormities

return into the Body of ſome man or

            <p>The <hi>Talapoins</hi> chief buſineſs is, to

go every morning to the Houſes or

there for a while with great reſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

they are of admirable virtue to the

with Copper, Tin, Salt-petre,
Elephants Teeth, <hi>Japon</hi> Wood, and
ſeveral other Merchandiſes which come
from other parts of <hi>India,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
are Linen-cloth, and other Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean
Commodities, when there comes
none from <hi>Siam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may alſo trade to the Coaſts of
<hi>Coromandel, Malabar</hi> and <hi>Bengala,</hi> the
Commodities are Elephants, Tin, Salt-petre,
Copper, Lead; and the returns
are Linen of all kinds.</p>
            <p>There is ſeldom any trade to <hi>Borneo;</hi>
this is an Iſle near that of <hi>Java,</hi> where
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60708:52"/>
the returns are Pepper, Dragons bloud,
white Camphire, yellow Wax, Gold,
Pearl, Diamonds, the beſt in the World.</p>
            <p>The Prince that poſſeſſes this Iſland
is not willing to permit a Trade, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
always ſome ſurpriſe, and will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
no European to ſettle in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.
There have been ſome French
Merchants there, for he truſts them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than any other Nation.</p>
            <p>There is alſo a Trade driven to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,</hi>
an Iſle near the <hi>Molucques,</hi> whence
is drawn yellow and white Wax, Gold,
Slaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thither is ſent Linen of
<hi>Suratte,</hi> Lead, Elephants Teeth Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
ſtrong Waters, ſome ſort of Arms,
red and black Cloth, and Silver. The
People here are peaceable, and negotiate
fairly. Here are a great many <hi>Portugueſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Commodities of <hi>Siam,</hi> there
is onely Tin, Lead, Ivory, Skins of
wild Beaſts and Elephants; there will
be ſtore of Pepper in time, that is to
ſay, the next Year, <hi>L'arrek,</hi> Iron, good
quantity of Rice, but you may find
here Commodities from all the places
before mentioned, and very cheap.
Here are brought pieces of Engliſh
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60708:52"/>
Cloth, and Searges, Coral and Amber,
Cloth from the Coaſts of <hi>Coromandel</hi>
and <hi>Suratte,</hi> Money in Piaſtres which
are truckt; but as I now ſaid, moſt
Merchants have left trading here ſince
the King would turn Merchant, there
being brought few Goods, for the Ships
that were wont to come here, came not
the laſt year; ſo that here's little to
be found, all being in the King and his
Miniſters Hands, who ſell for what
they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Siam</hi> is near three
hundred Leagues Long, without recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Tributary Kingdoms, to wit,
<hi>Camboges, Gehor, Patavi, Queda, &amp;c.</hi>
It's bounded northward by the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Pegu,</hi> and by the Sea of <hi>Ganges;</hi>
on the ſide of the Weſt, and from the
South by the little Strait of <hi>Malaca,</hi>
which was taken from the King of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>
by the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> who have been
Maſters of it near ſixty years; the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
have taken it from them, and
are the preſent Maſters of it; on the
Eaſt it's bounded by the Sea, and by
the Mountains which divide it from
<hi>Camboges</hi> and <hi>Laos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:60708:53"/>
The ſituation of this Kingdom is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous,
by reaſon of the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of its Coaſts, lying, as it were,
between two Seas, which open the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
to ſo many vaſt Regions; its Coaſts
are five hundred Leagues round, and
are every where acceſſible, from <hi>Japon,
China,</hi> the <hi>Philippin</hi> Iſlands, <hi>Tonquin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Cochinchine, Siampa, Camboge, Java,
Colconde, Bengala,</hi> and from all the
Coaſts of <hi>Coromandel, Perſia, Suratte,
Arabia</hi> and <hi>Europe;</hi> and therefore the
Countrey is capable of a great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
would the King permit all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to come and trade there as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>The Kingdom is divided into eleven
Provinces, to wit, that of <hi>Siam, Tana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerin,
Joſalam, Reda, Pra, Jor, Paam,
Parana, Ligor</hi> and <hi>Siama.</hi> Theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
had heretofore the Quality of
Kingdoms, but are all now under the
ſole power of the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> who
ſets Governours over them.</p>
            <p>There are ſome which may retain
the Name of Principalities, but the
Governours depend on the King, and
pay him Tribute. <hi>Siam</hi> is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60708:53"/>
Province of this Kingdom, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
City is ſituated fourteen degrees
and an half of latitude northward, on
the ſide of a great and ſtately River,
and Veſſels laden come up to the City,
which lies above forty Leagues diſtant
from the Sea, and reaches above two
hundred Leagues up the Countrey, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> this means it leads into part of the
Provinces, which I have above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.
This River abounds with Fiſh,
and its ſides are well peopled, although
they lie under water one part of the
Year. The Earth is indifferently fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
but ill dreſt, the inundation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from great Rains, which fall for
three or four Months together, which
makes their Rice grow apace, ſo that
the longer the inundation laſts, the
more Rice they gather; and ſo far are
they from complaining, that their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
fear is of dry weather. There are
ſeveral lands lie untilled, for want of
Inhabitants, which has happened by
the preceding Wars, and they being
enemies to labour, they love onely
thoſe things that are eaſie; ſo that
thoſe Plains and Foreſts which are to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60708:54"/>
be ſeen on the Mountains ſerve for a
retreat to Elephants, Tygers, and wild
Cows, Deer, and Rhinocero's, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Animals, which are here in great
quantities.</p>
            <p>As to Plants and Fruits, there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
in the Countrey, but which are
not of great uſe, and which cannot be
eaſily brought over, by reaſon of the
length of the way. There are no Birds
but what we have in <hi>Europe,</hi> excepting
one like a Black-bird, which counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits
the laughing of a Man, his ſinging
and whiſtling; the Fruits the moſt eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
are Durions, they have a very
ſtrong ſcent, which does not agree with
every body, but as to their taſte 'tis
excellent. This fruit is very hot and
dangerous to ones health, if a Man eats
much of it. There is a great Nut,
about which is a kind of Cream ſhut in
a rine, which my Palate could never
approve of.</p>
            <p>Mango is in this Countrey in prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
quantities, and this is the beſt
Fruit in the <hi>Indies,</hi> of an exquiſite taſte,
no ways incommoding, unleſs a Man
eats too much of them, then indeed
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60708:54"/>
they may cauſe a Fever; it's like an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,
but as big as a large Pear.</p>
            <p>The Mangouſtan is a Fruit like a
green Nut, which has within it a white
Fruit, of a ſharp and pleaſant taſte,
like that of a Peach or Plum, it's very
cold, and yet ſtringent.</p>
            <p>The Jacques is a great Fruit which
is very good, but hot, and cauſes Fluxes
in the Bowels when one eats of it with
exceſs.</p>
            <p>The Nana is like the Durion, that is
to ſay, in reſpect of its Skin, it has at
its end a crown of leaves, like the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichoke;
its meat is very good, taſting
like a Peach and Apricock together;
it's very hot and ſtrong, which makes
it commonly eaten ſoakt in Wine.</p>
            <p>The Figs are a ſweet Fruit of a kind
nature, yet ſomewhat phlegmatick,
there are of them all the year long.</p>
            <p>The Ate is a very good ſweet Fruit,
and does no hurt; there are who eſteem
it more than all the Fruits in the <hi>Indies.</hi>
There are Oranges of all kinds, which
are very good.</p>
            <p>The Pataie is a very good Fruit, but
the Tree which bears it lives onely two
years.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:60708:55"/>
The Penplemouſe is a wholeſome
Fruit which is like the Orange, but
of a ſharper taſte. There are ſeveral
other Fruits which are not ſo good.
They began ſome years paſt to ſow
Corn in the high Countries, near the
Mountains, which comes up well, and
is very good.</p>
            <p>As alſo Vines which have been ſeveral
times planted, but to little purpoſe,
being eaten up to the roots, by a ſort
of Ants.</p>
            <p>There are a great many Sugar Canes
which yield abundance, as alſo To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,
which the <hi>Siamoiſes</hi> eat with
<hi>Arrek</hi> and <hi>Lime.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Arrek</hi> the <hi>Siamoiſes</hi> eſteem
this Fruit more than any other, for
this is their common food; there is
ſuch a great quantity of it, that the
Markets are full of it; and a <hi>Siamoiſe</hi>
would think himſelf guilty of a great
undecency, ſhould he ſpeak to any one
without having his mouth full of <hi>Arrek
Betel,</hi> or Tobacco.</p>
            <p>There is no City in the Eaſt, where
is ſeen more different Nations, than
in the Capital Town of <hi>Siam,</hi> and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60708:55"/>
where ſo many different Tongues are
ſpoken; it is two Leagues round, and
half a League long, well peopled, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
ſo much under water, that it
reſembles rather an Iſland; there are
none but Engliſh, French, Moors and
<hi>Chinoiſes</hi> who dwell in the Town, all the
other Nations being lodged round about
it in Camps, each Nation by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
who, ſhould they come all of
them into one body, would take
up as much room as the Town does;
but the reaſons I before mentioned
hinder moſt ſtrange Nations to come
and bring any thing with them.</p>
            <p>The people are obliged to ſerve
the King four months in the year, and
longer if he needs them; he gives
them no pay, they being obliged to
keep themſelves; and therefore the
Women work to maintain their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.</p>
            <p>As to the Officers, from the greateſt
Lords of the Court, to the meaneſt of
the Kingdom, the King onely allows
them ſome ſmall gratifications, being
as much ſlaves as the reſt, and this
ſaves a great deal of money. As to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60708:56"/>
far diſtant Provinces whoſe Inhabitants
do not actually ſerve, each ſingular
perſon pays him a Tribute. I arrived
at a time when the Countrey was wholly
under water, the Town ſeemed the
more pleaſant for it; the Streets are
very long, large and ſtreight, there
are on both hands Houſes built on
Piles, and Trees planted round about
them, which makes a fine ſight, and
you cannot go to them but in a Boat;
you would think you ſee at one look
a City, a Sea and a vaſt Foreſt, where
are ſeveral <hi>Pagodes,</hi> which are their
Churches, moſt of which are gilded;
about theſe <hi>Pagodes</hi> there are places
like Church-Yards, planted with Trees,
which are for the moſt part Fruit-Trees,
the Houſes of the <hi>Talapoins</hi>
are the biggeſt and fineſt, and are very
numerous.</p>
            <p>This Countrey is wholſomer than
any of the Indies; the <hi>Siamoiſes</hi> are
commonly well ſhap'd, although all of
them have tanned Countenances, they
are well ſized, their Hair black, which
they wear ſhort by reaſon of the heat,
they Bathe often, which contributes to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60708:56"/>
the preſervation of their health; the
Europeans who dwell there do the
ſame to avoid ſickneſs: They go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
all their buſineſs in Barges, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Inundations, which laſts ſix
or ſeven months together.</p>
            <p>The King riſes in the morning, and
holds a great Council about ten of the
Clock, wherein all affairs are treated
of, which being ended his Phyſicians
aſſemble to know the ſtate of his health,
and he afterwards goes to Dinner; he
makes but one real Meal a day, and after
Dinner he withdraws into his Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where he ſleeps two or three
hours, and 'tis not known about what
he imploys himſelf the reſt of the time,
it not being permitted his Officers to
enter into his Chamber. About ten
at night he holds another privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
where there are ſeven or eight
<hi>Mandarins</hi> of thoſe which are moſt in
his favour; which Council laſts till
mid night: Afterwards he has Hiſtories
or Verſes made after their manner
read to him, to divert him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
after this Council, Mr. <hi>Conſtans</hi>
tarries with him alone, to whom he
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60708:57"/>
opens his whole mind; the King being
ſenſible of his vaſt parts, his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
pleaſes him, and he ſeldom can
get away till three of the clock in the
morning; and this is the manner of
the King's living. At certain times he
takes pleaſure in hunting, as I already
obſerved; he is always well dreſt: He
has no other Children, but a Daughter,
who is called the Princeſs Queen, of
twenty ſeven or twenty eight years of
age, the King greatly loves her; I was
told ſhe was a handſome woman, but
ſhe has never been ſeen by any men,
ſhe eats in the ſame place and at the
ſame time her Father does, but at a
Table apart, and ſhe is ſerved by
Women, who are always proſtrate in
her preſence.</p>
            <p>This Princeſs has her Court con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of <hi>Mandarins</hi> Ladies, who ſee
her every day; and ſhe holds a Council
with her Women about her own affairs;
ſhe diſtributes Juſtice to thoſe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to her, and the King having given
her Provinces, ſhe maintains her Court
with the Revenue. It has happened
that when her Women have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60708:57"/>
guilty of great ſlanders, or revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> made their mouths be ſowed up.</p>
            <p>Before the death of the Queen her
Mother, ſhe was as 'tis ſaid inclinable
to grèat ſeverities; ſhe goes ſometimes
a Hunting with the King, but 'tis in
a curious Chair placed on an Elephant,
and where though ſhe is not ſeen, yet
ſhe beholds all that paſſes. There are
Horſemen who march before her to
clear the way, and if there be any
one in the road that cannot ſoon get
out, he proſtrates himſelf on the ground
on his face. She is all day ſhut up with
her Women, diverting her ſelf with no
work, her dreſs is plain and light,
her Legs bare, ſhe has light Pumps on
her feet, always bare headed, and wears
her Hair not paſſing four or five Fingers
long: She is a great lover of ſweet
ſcents, anointing her Head with oil;
for in thoſe Countries their Hair muſt
look ſhining, to be fine; ſhe Bathes
every day, which is the cuſtome of all
Indians, as well men as women: I
have learnt all this of Madam <hi>Conſtans,</hi>
who oft makes her Court to her. All
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60708:58"/>
the Women which are in her Chamber
are always proſtrate with their faces <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
the ground in a rank; the ancienteſt are
neareſt her, and they have the liberty
to look on the Princeſs, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
have not in reference to the King, be
they of what quality they will; for as
long as they are in his preſence, they
lye proſtrate on the ground, even when
they ſpeak to him.</p>
            <p>The King has two Brothers. The
King's Brethren here are next Heirs of
the Crown, to the Excluſion of his
Children. When he goes out to Hunt
or walk, notice is given to all Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans
not to be in the way, unleſs they
will lye proſtrate on the ground. A
while before he goes out of his Palace
you hear the Trumpets ſound and
Drums beat, who march before the
King; at this noiſe the Souldiers who
ſtand in a row, proſtrate themſelves,
their foreheads to the ground, with
their Muskets under them; they are
in this poſture as long as the King
can ſee them on his Elephant, where
he is placed in a cloſe gilt Chair; the
Horſe-Guard which attends him, which
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60708:58"/>
conſiſts of Moors is about forty, all
the King's Houſhold are on foot, ſome
behind and ſome on one ſide, holding
their hands cloſed, and thus follow
him.</p>
            <p>There are ſome of the principal
<hi>Mandarins</hi> who follow him on Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants,
ten or twelve Officers who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Umbrellas about the King, and
there are onely thoſe who do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
themſelves, for at the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that the King ſtops, all the other
fall down on their faces, and even thoſe
that are on Elephants.</p>
            <p>As to the manner which the King
of <hi>Siam</hi> obſerves in the reception of
Ambaſſadors, as thoſe of <hi>Tonquin, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinchine,
Colconda, Malais, Java,</hi> and
other Kingdoms; he receives them in
a great Hall covered with Tapeſtry,
the chief men of the Kingdom being
in another Hall which ſtands lower,
and the Officers of leſſer quality in
another, lower than the former, all of
them proſtrate on Tapeſtry in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the King's appearance at a
window which is over againſt them;
the Hall wherein the Ambaſſadors
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60708:59"/>
muſt be is raiſed about ten or twelve
feet, and diſtant from this Hall thirty
feet; 'tis known the King is upon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
by the noiſe of Trumpets,
Drums and other Inſtruments: The
Ambaſſadors are behind a wall which
encloſes this Room in expectation of
the King's coming, and the Miniſter's
orders, which the King ſends by
one of the Officers of his Chamber,
according to the quality of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors;
after the Miniſters have the
King's command, the door of the Hall
is opened, and then the Ambaſſadors
appear with their Interpreters, and
the Officer of the King's Chamber,
who ſerves for a Maſter of Ceremonies,
and precedes them on his Knees, his
hands cloſed; the Ambaſſador with his
Interpreters follows him in the ſame
poſture, with great modeſty, till he is
come one half of the way where he is
to go, and then bows himſelf three
times, and ſo continues going to the
neareſt corner of the Halls where the
Guards are, and then he begins to
bow again; there is a Table between
the King and the Ambaſſador, about
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60708:59"/>
eight foot diſtant, where lye the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents,
which the Ambaſſador brings
the King, and between this Table and
the Ambaſſador's there is a <hi>Mandarin</hi>
who receives the King's words: in this
Hall are the King's Miniſters, diſtant
from the Ambaſſadors about three
paces, and the Captain of the people,
whence the Ambaſſador is, between him
and the Miniſters; the King begins to
ſpeake firſt, and not the Ambaſſador,
ordering his Miniſters to enquire of
the Ambaſſador, when he parted from
the Preſence of his Maſter, whether
the King and all the Royal Family be
in health, to which the Ambaſſador
anſwers what's fitting, by his Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the Interpreter tells it the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the Nation (as they call it)
of which the Ambaſſador is, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to the <hi>Barcalon,</hi> and the <hi>Barcalon</hi>
to the King. After this the King
offers ſome queſtions about two or
three Points concerning the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor;
and afterwards the King orders
the next Officer to the Table to give
<hi>Betel</hi> to the Ambaſſador, which is the
ſign to preſent him a Veſt; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60708:60"/>
the King retires with the
noiſe of Drums and Trumpets, and
other Inſtruments. The Ambaſſador's
firſt Audience paſſes between him and
the Miniſter, who examines the Letter,
and the Preſents of the Prince who
has ſent them: The Ambaſſador does
not preſent the Letter to the King,
but to the Miniſter, after ſome days
of Council held on this ſubject.</p>
            <p>When they be Ambaſſadors of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant
Kings, as of the Countries
of <hi>Perſia,</hi> the Great <hi>Mogol,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
of <hi>China</hi> or <hi>Japon,</hi> they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in this following manner.</p>
            <p>The Grandees of the firſt and ſecond
rank go to the foot of the window
where the King is, to proſtrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
according to their qualities on
Tapeſtry, when thoſe of the third,
fourth and fifth rank, are in a lower
Hall, and expect the King's coming,
who appears at a window which jets
out of a wall, and is raiſed ten foot;
the Ambaſſadors are in a place out
of the Palace, expecting the Maſter
of the Ceremonies, who comes and
receives them, and there are the ſame
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60708:60"/>
Ceremonies uſed which I have already
mentioned. The Ambaſſador entring
into the Palace, puts his hand upon
his head, marches through two Halls
to the Stairs, which are over againſt
the window where the King is, and
when he is there, he claps one knee
to the ground, and then immediately
a door is opened that he may appear
before the King, and the ſame Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
are practiſed which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
denoted. There is a Golden
Platter on the Table, wherein lyes the
letter tranſlated and open, having
been received by the Miniſters ſome
days before in a Hall appointed for
that purpoſe. When the Ambaſſador
is in his place the Miniſter's Deputy
takes the Letter, and reads it aloud;
which done, the King asks the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador

come now to relate my departure
which was on the twenty ſecond of
<hi>December,</hi> 1685.</p>
            <p>We hoiſted Sail at three of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with a good Northern wind, which
continued all along the Coaſts of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boge,</hi>
which is a Kingdom adjoyning
to that of <hi>Siam,</hi> and <hi>Cochinchine,</hi> The
People of theſe two Kingdoms have
the ſame belief, and live after the ſame
manner, There paſt nothing remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Strait of <hi>Banca,</hi> where I
ran on ground, on the ſide of an Iſle
called <hi>Lucapara,</hi> on a Muddy bank
where there were but three fathoms of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60708:61"/>
water, and our Veſſel required above
ſixteen; this did not much diſturb me,
though it did much the Ships Crew,
whom I ſent to ſound about the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
I cauſed a ſmall Anchor to be
brought, to which there was a Cable,
and we got off this bank in leſs than
five hours, and though I had a good
Dutch Pilot, yet I cauſed this Strait
to be often ſouded; I continued my
courſe and arrived at <hi>Bantam</hi> the
eleventh of <hi>January,</hi> 1686. As ſoon
as I had caſt Anchor there, I ſent an
Officer of my Ship to Complement the
Governour, and to have freſh provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
He ſent me for a Preſent ſix
Oxen, Fruits and Herbs, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in this Road but thirty hours.
We weighed Anchor on the twelfth
at night, but the calm overtook us,
which obliged us to caſt Anchor.</p>
            <p>On the thirteenth I weighed Anchor,
and we had all that day calms and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
winds, but at night there aroſe
a ſmall wind, which made us double
the point of <hi>Bartam,</hi> and paſs the
Strait of <hi>Sonda</hi> in leſs than eight hours:
I was obliged to land at the Iſle of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60708:62"/>
               <hi>Prince,</hi> which is at the mouth of the
Strait; in expectation of the <hi>Mali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
Frigat, which could not follow us, but
at length joyned us.</p>
            <p>On the fourteenth I held on my courſe
directly for the Cape of Good Hope,
with a favorable North wind, and North
North-Eaſt. The twenty third at break
of day having made about an hundred
and fifty Leagues we ſaw the Iſles of
Holy Croſs, which ſurpriſed us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the evening before I cauſed the
Pilots point to be ſhowed me, who
told me to be at fartheſt, but fifteen
Leagues of Latitude Southward, and
twenty of Longitude.</p>
            <p>This Iſland lyes very low, and had
it been three or four hours in the night,
we had certainly run on ground, but
it pleaſed God to preſerve us. We
attributed this error to the Tides which
ran againſt us; we paſt this Iſle quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the wind blowing hard, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
our courſe. The Sea is full
of Fiſh in theſe parts, and there are a
great many Birds, the weather was fair,
and we every day made thirty, forty,
fifty Leagues; we were diverted by
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60708:62"/>
pleaſant game we ſaw carried on by
the <hi>Albucorps</hi> and <hi>Bonnitres,</hi> and a ſmall
Fiſh called a flying-fiſh, who when he
ſees himſelf purſued, gets out of the
water, and flyes as long as his wings
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie moiſt, which may be as far per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
as the flight of wild Ducks;
but there is a Bird which carries a great
feather in its Tail, longer than the
others by half a foot, and which has
the form and almoſt the colour of a
Straw; he is always in the air, and
when he ſees this flying-fiſh leave
the water, he lets himſelf fall down
upon it, as a bird of prey on his game,
and ſome times they go deep into the
water after it; ſo that this ſlying-fiſh
ſeldom fails being taken.</p>
            <p>On the fifteenth of <hi>February,</hi> we
found our ſelves not far from the Iſle
of <hi>Maurice,</hi> where we met with a
blaſt of wind that laſted us three days;
the Sea was extreme rough, and gave
us a great deal of trouble; the waves
paſſing oft over our Ship, which made
as to ply our Pumps to clear it of
water.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:60708:63"/>
On the ninteenth the Weather grew
fair, and gave us leaſure to ſet to rights
what the Sea had diſordered. The firſt
night wherein this bad weather hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
the Frigat that was with me
left us, the rendeſvouz being at the
Cape of Good Hope. Keeping on our
courſe we had more hard weather, which
much incommoded us, the waves bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
againſt our Ship in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as threatened great danger.</p>
            <p>On the tenth of <hi>March,</hi> about two
hours after noon, we perceived a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
at firſt I thought it was that which
had left me, but coming nearer, we
ſaw her carrying Engliſh Colours, and
being willing to hear. News, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
ſhe came from <hi>Europe;</hi> I came
up to her, and ſent out my long Boat
with an Officer, to know if there were
any Wars, for when a man has been
long at Sea, one Knows not whom to
truſt; word was brought me 'twas an
Engliſh Merchant-Man, who, had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from <hi>London</hi> five months ſince,
and had touched now here, and that
he intended ſtreight for <hi>Tonquoin,</hi> that
the Captain had told him that there
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60708:63"/>
was no War in <hi>France,</hi> and that all
<hi>Europe</hi> was at Peace; but yet there
had been ſome troubles in <hi>England</hi>
occaſioned by the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi>
who had placed himſelf at the Head of
ten or twelve thouſand men, but that the
King's Troops had routed them, and
taken him Priſoner; and that he was
beheaded, and ſeveral of his Followers
hanged, and ſo this rebellion was ended.
He alſo told us that he had ſeen Land
the day before ſeven Leagues off, which
made us judge that we were thirty or
thirty five Leagues off of it. We held
on our courſe the reſt of the day and
night, and the next morning at ten
of the clock we ſpied Land, ſeven or
eight Leagues off us; I ſounded and we
found fourſcore fathom and upward,
we clapt on all our Sail to endeavour
to get before night to the Cape of
Good Hope; the next morning at
break of day we ſaw it and doubled
it; about ten of the clock we eſpied
a Veſſel windward of us, and drawing
near we found 'twas the Frigat, which
left us near the Iſle of <hi>Maurice;</hi> this
was the ſecond time we met after our
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60708:64"/>
ſeparation, both together at the place
of our appointment, which ſeldom
happens on the Sea. When I was
ready to caſt Anchor the wind blew
ſo hard againſt us, that I was forced
to tack about and Anchor at the Iſle
of <hi>Robins,</hi> which is about three Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
from the Fort of the Cape; the
next morning being the thirteenth of
<hi>March</hi> we weighed Anchor, and went
and rode near the Fort, where I arrived
about two of the clock: I found there
nine Veſſels which came from <hi>Batavia,</hi>
and were bound for <hi>Europe.</hi> I ſent the
Ghevalier <hi>Cibois</hi> to Complement the
Governour, and to ask his leave to
ſend eight or ten ſick people on ſhoar,
and take in freſh water and neceſſary
Browiſions. He received reſpectfully
my Complement, and bid the Officer
tell me, I was Maſter, and that I might
do what I pleaſed. Arriving there in
Autumn, wherein all Fruits are good,
he ſent me Melons, Grapes and Salads,
I ſaluted the Fort with ſeven Cannon;
for the King's order is to ſalute the
Forts firſt, and they were exactly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.
The Veſſel which carried the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60708:64"/>
Admiral's Flag, ſaluted me afterwards
with ſeven pleces, and I returned him
the ſame Civility. There were in this
fleet three flag Ships, to wit, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral,
Vice-Admiral and Counter-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral.
The Fruit which was ſent me
were excellent good, as well as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lads,
and ſo were the Melons and
Grapes; I went to land, and walked
in their Garden, which made me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
thoſe in <hi>France,</hi> for as I alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſaid, 'twas a very fine one, and
well kept; the great quantity of Pulſe
growing there is very gratefull to Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring
Men, the Governour was no Nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
ordering us what we pleaſed.</p>
            <p>He is a Man of ſenſe, and well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the place he holds, in which 'tis
ſaid, if he remains long, he will make
his Fortune: When there be any <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
that will dwell there, he gives
them as much Land as they will, builds
them a Houſe, gives them Oxen for
Tillage, and all other Cattel and Uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils
of Husbandry that are neceſſary;
all which is valued, and when they
are able they pay the Company for
them. They are obliged to fell all the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60708:65"/>
Fruits of their Lands to the Comapany,
at a certain price, which is advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
to both parties. The Wine that
they buy of them for ſixteen Crowns an
Hogſhead, they ſell for an hundred to
ſtrangers, and to their own Fleets which
paſs this way; that is to ſay, to the
Seamen who drink it on the ſpot; Sheep
and Oxen are ſold alſo proportionably,
which brings a great Revenue to the
Company; and makes their Fleets re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh
themſelves at ſmall charge, and
remain whole months there, according
to their occaſions.</p>
            <p>When I arrived, 'twas not long ſince
the Governour was returned from a
Diſcovery which he had made of Gold
and Silver Mines. 'Tis ſaid that there
are many, and that they lie eaſie and
ſhallow. He was two hundred and fifty
Leagues up the Countrey; he carried
along with him three or four <hi>Outan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toſts,</hi>
who ſpake Dutch, who lead him to
the next Nation, which was likewiſe <hi>Ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantoſts,</hi>
and took others in his way. He
met with near nine different Nations,
or ſorts of People, ſome of which he
took along with him, according as he
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60708:65"/>
changed the People, to make himſelf
underſtood; he has, I am told, gotten
great light in what he aimed at; he
ſays the laſt Nation is the moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,
and that they came before him
Men and Women dancing, being all
clothed with the skins of Tygers, which
hung down to their Feet. He brought
one of theſe <hi>Outantoſts,</hi> whom he has
cauſed to be taught Dutch, to return
thither the next Year. All theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
People have many Cattle, and this
is their Revenue. The Governour had
with him fifty Souldiers, a Painter to
draw colours of Beaſts, Birds, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents;
and ſuch Plants as he ſhould find;
one to obſerve the courſe they took,
and a Pylot, for they went always by
the Compaſs, and drove along with
them three hundred Oxen, to carry
their Proviſions, and draw fourteen or
fifteen Carts; when they met with any
Mountains they diſmounted their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,
and took out whatſoever was
therein, and loaded the Oxen with it,
and thus paſſed over them. Being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
in the Countrey, they were
three or four days before they could
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60708:66"/>
find any Water, which much incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded
them; he was five Months and
an half in this Journey.</p>
            <p>He met with ſeveral wild Bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s, and
ſays that the Elephants are Monſters,
far exceeding in bigneſs thoſe of the
<hi>Indies;</hi> as alſo Rhinocero's of a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
ſize. He ſaw one with which he
thought he ſhould have been killed;
for when this Animal is in a fury, there
is no weapon can ſtop him, his Skin is
hard, and a Muſquet ſhot cannot pierce
it; they have two Horns which grow
together in the Skin of this Animal.</p>
            <p>The Abode I made at the Cape fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
me with Fiſh during the time of
Lent. I ſaw a Whale of the largeſt ſize,
I think which came within leſs than a
Piſtol ſhot of our Veſſel; there were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
ſtore of Birds, which gave us the
ſame diverſion as thoſe which I have
already mentioned.</p>

            </list>
            <p>On the twenty ſixth of <hi>March</hi> at two
in the afternoon, I ſet Sail with a
good Wind; in leaving the Bay near
the Dutch Fort of the Cape of Good
Hope, I ſaw three Veſſels who made
towards the Cape, but I could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
of what Nation they were, I
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60708:69"/>
believe them to have been Dutch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this number was expected from
the Iſle of <hi>Ceilan.</hi> After we had paſt
forty Leagues from thence, we found
the Sea very boiſterous, which gave us
much trouble, but we continued on
our courſe to paſs the Line in the ſame
longitude we did before. Our Voyage
muſt needs be pleaſant, for as I alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
noted, the King of <hi>Siam</hi> ſent with
us Ambaſſadors into <hi>France,</hi> to ſhew
the King how earneſtly he deſired his
Friendſhip; his great Qualities and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown
having reached his Ears, and
been long ſince known in the <hi>Indies.</hi>
He told me in an Audience, that he
would give them no Inſtructions in
point of Ceremony, thoſe of <hi>France</hi>
being very different from his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom's,
becauſe he was perſuaded the
King would not require any thing of
them prejudicial to his Honour, and
that he would leave me to counſel them
what they had to doe when they came
to <hi>France;</hi> that he relied upon me for
this, being ſure I would not impoſe
upon them. We had then with us three
Ambaſſadors, the moſt conſiderable
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60708:69"/>
Perſons in <hi>Siam.</hi> The firſt is Brother
to the late deceaſed <hi>Barcalon,</hi> who was
the King's Chief Miniſter, a Man of
ſenſe, having been ever concerned with
his Brother in all his greateſt Affairs;
this Perſon, accompanied with another,
came and received me at the mouth of
the River of <hi>Siam,</hi> when I arrived, and
has been ever with me, attending me
wherever I went. The firſt time I ſaw
him he ſeemed to me an ingenious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
free from all affectation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedneſs,
which made me tell Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Conſtans</hi> that he would be a very
fit Man to be ſent over Ambaſſador to
<hi>France.</hi> The ſecond is aged, and wants
not wit, having been Ambaſſador in
<hi>China,</hi> and acquitted himſelf to the
King his Maſter's Satisfaction. The
third is aged about twenty five or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years, his Father is Ambaſſador in
<hi>Portugal;</hi> theſe are the beſt natured
People in the World very eaſie and
obliging, good humoured, and their
Friendſhip is not to be regarded as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable.
They write down the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
matters they ſee, and I like that
the better, ſeeing they will have Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60708:70"/>
enough in <hi>France,</hi> neither do
I doubt but they will give a true Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of them to their Maſter.</p>
            <p>They ſhould have had twelve <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darins</hi>
for their Retinue, but they have
but eight, four of them being left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
at <hi>Siam,</hi> becauſe they came not
ſoon enough on board; they brought
with them twelve young Youths, to
learn the Tongue, and Trades, but part
of them are alſo left behind with the
<hi>Mandarins.</hi> The Abbat <hi>de Lionne</hi> was
entreated by this King to go to <hi>France</hi>
with his Ambaſſadors, becauſe he ſpeaks
their Language. The King alſo told
Mr. <hi>Vacher,</hi> that he would be very glad
that he would return with his Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors,
which he has alſo done; he
will be to them of great uſe, being an
active Perſon. We have alſo with us
Monſr. the Abbat <hi>de Choiſy,</hi> who went
to <hi>Siam</hi> to reſide there in quality of
Ambaſſador, in caſe the King ſhould
become a Chriſtian; he is a very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt.
Gentleman, and wants no good
quality. He ſaid his firſt Maſs on board
us, and gave us ſeveral good Sermons;
Monſr. the Abbat <hi>du Charter</hi> was of our
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60708:70"/>
company, an able and honeſt Preacher.
Mr. <hi>Vaudricourt</hi> was the Captain of our
Veſſel; he is a Gentleman admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
well qualified for his Place, taking
care of every thing that concerned
him, and gave us all content.</p>
            <p>There have remained about twelve or
fifteen French men at <hi>Saim,</hi> in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of that King, or Mr. <hi>Conſtans</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Continued my courſe till I dame
near to the Iſle of St. <hi>Pleten</hi> which is
inhabited by Engliſh; ſuch Ships as
come from the <hi>Indies</hi> touch there, that
is to ſay when they go not to the
Cape of Good Hope; I was told it
was a very good and fruitfull Iſland,
it lyes ſix Degrees Latitude Southwards
I paſt on in ſight of the Iſle of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion</hi>
which is eight degrees South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of the Line. This Iſle is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited,
moſt Veſſels make ſome ſtay
here to take Tortoiſes, there being
here great numbers of them, and they
are no ſmall refreſhment to Sea-faring
men; they live a month or ſix weeks
without eating, they can onely be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
a nights, for in the day time they
keep to the Sea, and at night come
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60708:71"/>
to Land to lay their Eggs, which they
hide in the ſand. To take them you
muſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly hid with a great ſtick in your
hand, and ſurpriſe them when they come
out of the water, and throw them on
their backs, and then they cannot ſtir;
a man may ſtrike fourſcore or an
hundred in a night. Here Veſſels come
on purpoſe to take theſe animals and
ſalt them, and then carry them to the
Iſles in <hi>America,</hi> being bought by
the Inhabitants for their Slaves. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a good wind I tarried not long
here, not being willing to loſe time
in paſſing the Equinoctial Line; for
ſometimes a man is forced to be long
about it by reaſon of calms and rains
to be met there: The twenty eighth of
<hi>April</hi> I paſt the Line moſt happily, the
heats no wiſe incommoding us; this is
the fourth time I paſt it without lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
my Cloth Suit; all our men were
in health excepting four or five, who
were ſick of the Gripes, which Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper
they brought from <hi>Siam;</hi> this
Diſtemper is ſeldom cured in that
Countrey, and I loſt about ten or
twelve men who died of it. We ſaw
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60708:71"/>
but few Fiſh all along, which is unuſual,
for one commonly meets with great
quantities: We took one about eight
foot long and four foot broad, he had
a hole on the to pof his head, through
which he breaths, and throws up wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the air like a fountain; he
made a great noiſe, and weighed about
three hundred weight, he is good to eat.
On the twenty ninth we took two
more Fiſh which weighed about an
hundred and fifty a piece. We were
on the Northern Coaſts, having a good
wind; I was about thirty two days
coming from the Cape of Good Hope
to the Line.</p>
            <p>On the ſixteenth of <hi>May</hi> about
midnight we paſt the Tropick accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the beſt judgment our Pylots
could make in taking the height. On
the ſeventeenth about noon, this being
the ſixth time we paſt the Tropicks
in this Voyage, we left by the benefit
of a good wind the Torrid Zone.</p>
            <p>The firſt of <hi>June</hi> we ſaw Land, when
we thought we werea bove an hundred
and fifty Leagues off it; this ſurpriſed
us, becauſe there aroſe great miſts
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60708:72"/>
we were obliged to draw near it, and
the weather clearing, we found it was
the Iſle of <hi>Flora,</hi> which is one of the
<hi>Aures,</hi> and which lyes moſt Weſtward,
and ſtands high, there falls from its
mountains great water courſes into the
Sea. We needed ſwift ſtreams to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
us to the Weſt, which we gained
above an hundred and fifty Leagues
Eaſtward. The fifth we ſaw a Veſſel
that came near us, but it being night
we knew not what ſhe was, on the
ſeventh we ſaw another which advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
towards us, I ſent an Officer on
board in my long Boat, who brought
me word it was an Engliſh Veſſel that
came from <hi>Virginia</hi> and was bound to
<hi>London,</hi> ſhe was laden with Tobacco;
and there being a great wind, and we
out ſailing her, ſoon left her behind
us. We had variable weather till the
twelvth, but about ſix of the clock at
night, having a Weſtern wind, the Sea
grew ſo boiſterous, it blowing hard
alſo that we were forced to let down
all our ſail and caſt Anchor being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
an hundred Leagues diſtant from
<hi>Breſt.</hi> The weather being very cloudy
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60708:72"/>
and ſhowery; we kept off the Land
as much as poſſible, for theſe blaſts
of winds laſts ſometimes eight days
together, but about ten of the clock
at night on the thirteenth the wind
grew calm, and we again ſet ſail, and
on the eighteenth of <hi>June</hi> arrived in
the Road of <hi>Breſt,</hi> at four in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon,
where as ſoon as we had
caſt Anchor I made both our Ships
fire their Guns to ſalute the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors
of <hi>Siam,</hi> which I brought along
with me.</p>
