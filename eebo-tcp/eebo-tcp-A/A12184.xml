            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>To mention your name before the glorious labour of so great and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

Blessed is the wing that is spread over any of the things of Iesus Christ to shelter them.</p>
            <p>Againe, to put into your hand, and from your hand into your heart, the remembrance of that God, that will gloriously recompence your faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in that great trust committed to you, cannot but (by the blessing of him to whom blessing belongeth) be a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall meanes to strengthen your heart in the pange of government, and cause you to travaile and bring forth with more ease.

earth as the shadow of death. So there are bookes that are laden with divine and true treasure, that will recompence the Reader, his labour and paines seven fold into his bosome, that will open his mouth and enlarge his heart to blesse God, that hath given gifts unto men: Againe there are bookes also that will deale cruelly and deceitfully with men, consuming their pretious time &amp; oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, taking their mony for that which is not bread. Now the more dreamers of dreames there are, there had neede be the more that see visions.

               </note>[<hi>Brethren.</hi>] By this loving Compellation hee labours to enter into their hearts and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; well knowing, That exhortations are of the more force, being directed to those that are perswaded of the good affection of the speaker. If exhortation comes from the pride of a man, the pride of man in the hearers will beat it back, and give no entertainment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>But why are Christians Brethren?</p>
            <p>First, they have the same beginning of life from the same Father: as also they have the same common Brother, that is, Christ. They have the same wombe, the Church; the same food, the Word of God. They have the same promises: they are all heires, all borne to an Inheritance. Furthermore, the word <hi>Brother</hi> is a word of equality and of dignitiy: of equality, though in personall Callings one is superior to other, yet this takes not away the common Brotherhood. This should fill up the vallies of mens hearts dejected here, in regard of their meane estates; as also pull downe the mountaines of the proud hearts of men, lifted up through these outward things. Kings must not lift up themselves in disdaine of others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17807:7"/>
all these personall respects end in death, we carry them not to Heaven; and in those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects that we agree in here, as in Grace and Goodnesse, we shall continue united for ever. And yet must we honour such as are in emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie, and acknowledge them as men worthy of all respect, and give them dignity accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their places.</p>
            <p>But further, this is <hi>a name of Dignitie,</hi> it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues that we are not basely borne, that we are sonnes of God, and heires of Heaven: Christ after his resurrection, the first terme he gives his Disciples, tell my Brethren (saith he) I go to my Father and their Father. This <hi>word is also a word of love,</hi> and therewith the Apostle insinuates the affections of the Philippians. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine therefore thy affections towards the sonnes of God. If we love and respect them as our own Brethren, good is our estate: if we hate them, our estate cannot be good.</p>
            <p>And in the second place, <hi>Let not this word be appropriated to some, and not to others, which are notwithstanding of the same number.</hi> For one brother cannot make another no brother: for it is one and the same Father that makes Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. So long therefore as thou seest any thing of Christ in any, breake not off thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and disdaine not the name of brother to such: for where the spirit is, it workes in us a resemblance of God; and where it stamps his Image, it makes them Brethren.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> It is a Christians dutie to rejoyce. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded here: Ministers are injoyned to speak comfort to such, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. <hi>Comfort yee, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort yee</hi> my people; and Christ came to binde up the broken in heart, and the Ministers sent to shew men their unrighteousnesse. <hi>Iob.</hi> 33.23. The spirit that is in such is the spirit of joy: and therefore joy is reckoned as a fruit of the spirit <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22.</p>
            <p>And why should not Christians rejoyce? they are <hi>free from the spirituall Egypt, from greatest miseries.</hi> Nay why should not we sing as the Israelites did after their deliverance? our enemies, and deliverance, is farre greater than theirs. And <hi>we have the greatest prerogatives</hi>; we have here an assured hope of eternall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect happinesse hereafter, we have peace with God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. We have free accesse in all our wants to the throne of grace, and wee have a God ready to heare all our prayers, and to helpe us; we have many gift, already received, Christ is already given us, we are in a state of regeneration; and for the time to come, wee have promises from God, the God of truth, that nothing shall separate us from Christ: surely these are great causes of joy in us: and having such things as these, wee dishonour them, the giver of them, and our selves, and our profession, if we rejoyce not in them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> In the second place observe, That it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17807:8"/>
only to Christians to rejoyce. Others have neither cause of joy, nor commandement to rejoyce: the Ministers and Prophets are bidden to bid such howle and lament, to shew them their miserable estate. And indeed what ground can a condemned person have of joy? for the wicked, till they have remission of sins, they are in a damned estate, and though they will snatch this to themselves, and say that they are sure to be saved, yet is salvation not their portion. They joy indeed, but it is in sinne; in seeing, or doing evill to others. Or if sometimes they joy in the Gospell, (for a wicked man may doe so) it is but a forced joy: and much like hot waters to a cold fit of an Ague, it brings heate, and expulses cold for the present, but it burnes them after. So this joy seemes to comfort them now, but when triall comes it failes him, and makes him more disconsolate to see himselfe thus beguiled. Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it were for such to bee first humbled, and brought to the sight of their estate, than to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister comfort to them, to speake peace where none belongs is to undoe men. It is the broken that must be healed, and the wearie that must come to Christ.</p>
            <p n="3">3 In the third place observe,<note n="3" place="margin">
                  <hi>Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </note> The limitation of this joy; it must be in the Lord; That is, in Christ, who in the new Testament is often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Lord, and he is our Lord: First by gift, God hath given us all to Christ. Secondly, by Conquest, he hath gotten victory of Sathan.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17807:9"/>
And thirdly by marriage. And therefore we may well call him Lord, and rejoyce in him, because he is our Lord: for by him we come to conquer all our enemies, by him wee have peace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. he makes us Kings and Priests, and brings us to heaven.</p>
            <p>Now for the practise of this dutie of rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in the Lord, that we may be incouraged, let us consider how it is a meanes not onely of <hi>adherence to God,</hi> but also of <hi>obedience to his Lawes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 Ioy, if it bee sound, knits us firme to God, so as we rest contented in him as our on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and sufficient joy, seeking for no other joy in any other thing. To us Christ is made <hi>all in all</hi>; That we should solace our selves in his fulnesse, which if we truely doe, we will count all other things as despised, assuring our selves, they cannot minister, or adde, any jote of sound comfort at all, and therefore will not indure any thought of mixture of other things with Christ, thereby to make him more sufficient and compleate for our joy to rest on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obedience to his lawes</hi>: for joy stirres up chearfulnesse to every duty, and makes all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties acceptable to God and man: for the want hereof many are dead, and dull in good duties; and where a large portion of this joy is, it will remove all lets and delayes to dutie. It doth not only inable us <hi>to,</hi> but <hi>in</hi> dutie. <hi>Cain</hi> no doubt came cheerfully to a good duty, to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice: but for want of this cheerfull, and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full spirit, what was his behaviour in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17807:9"/>
thereof? <hi>His countenance was cast downe</hi>: this God espies sodainly, and so hee doth in all our dull performances: for he looks things should be done cheerfully, and reason too, for he hath left us a treasure of excellent promises to incourage us. We see it in men, they love when a thing is done cheerfully, they know it betokens love in the partie that doth it: and can we then thinke it strange that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it. Againe, if we can fashion our selves to this dutie, God hath promised to increase our joy more abundantly: And he performed it to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. <hi>end.</hi> He will give delight as a reward to him that delighteth in his worke. And therefore we ought to labour to bring our selves to this dutie; to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of which, observe these directions.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Meanes to get Ioy.</hi>
               </note> consider, <hi>that joy comes from Faith.</hi> For it is the sense of our reconciliation with Christ, that makes us rejoyce, <hi>Rom</hi> 5. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6. Now therefore whatsoever streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens Faith, strengthens also our joy; and contrarily what weakens the one, must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie weaken the other. Furthermore, <hi>joy comes from peace.</hi> Whatsoever therefore dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbs our peace, must needs disturbe our joy. Therefore Sathan to despoile us of our joy, he spoiles our faith through our sinnes, and by them he weakens our hope and our comfort. What is to be done then? Surely repaire to the fountaine of health, the well of joy, the Word of God, <hi>Isa.</hi> 12.3. And from thence
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17807:10"/>
must we draw all our comfort. Use therefore the ordinances of God, but use them as in the Lord, in obedience to his commandement, and expect the issue with patience. Many there are that use the meanes, but take no joy at all in them: why? they doe it not as in obedience to Gods command, but they rest in the deed done, and they thinke God is bound to give them joy: God justly denies such that which they presume of.</p>
            <p>In the second place; <hi>Pray that your joy may bee full.</hi> See this in most of <hi>Davids</hi> Psalmes, at the first he complaines for the want of Gods presence of Gods wrath and anger, but comes off with a large portion of comfort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Depart from me yee wicked, for the Lord hath heard my prayer,</hi> Psal. 6. In the use of all meanes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore joyne prayer: pray for faith, for hope, and such graces as may bring joy. Though at first thou findest thy selfe to bee cold, to have little or no comfort at all, yet give not over, thou shalt at length find plentie thereof. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the woman of <hi>Canaan:</hi> at the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised and called dogge, but what did her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy gaine? A gracious answer, <hi>O woman, great is thy faith, bee it to thee as thou desirest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the third place; <hi>Remember former times as David did, Psal.</hi> 77.6. hee was so oppressed, his <hi>sore ranne in the night, and ceased not,</hi> (as hee saith.) But then, <hi>I remembred the daies of old, &amp;c.</hi> Consider thou also in thy deepest affliction, times were once when thou hadst the cleare,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17807:10"/>
and comfortable light of Gods spirit present with thee: he will not leave thee, his nature is unchangeable, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the fourth place: <hi>Have societie with the Saints,</hi> and keepe company with those that are good, and as the two Disciples hearts did burne when they talkt with Christ; so verily thou shalt finde this heate of comfort, by little and little to increase: For God blesses the communion of Saints, and such as are discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Christians, can tell us more, and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely bring things to mind which thou thy selfe remembrest not, and can informe our judgments when they are blinded with griefe and melancholly. Use therefore the company of the good, when thou findest doubts arise, and make thy griefs knowne to some wise and judicious Christian, for the divell is too strong for any one alone, hee will prevaile against thee, thou wilt be too weake too wrestle with him hand to hand. It is no wonder therefore that <hi>Melancholy persons</hi> are so destitute of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> It will be asked: May we not rejoyce in friends societie, deliverance from dangers, and the like good things of this world?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I answer yes: and yet joy in the Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, for when as whatsoever we have, we receive it as a token of Gods particular love to us in Christ who both gives us our daily bread, and the word of life; comforts both heavenly and earthly, These outward things then, I say, doe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17807:11"/>
strengthen the faith of a Christian, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our joy is strengthened: wherefore wee may thus joy in them, nay it is our duty to do it. The wicked they indeed receive them, but onely as from Gods care of the generall good of the world, or race of mankinde: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can take no joy truely from them as the child of God doth: who in the right use of them, first rejoyceth that he is the child of God, and is reconciled to him in Christ, that Christ is his; and then that he having the field, hath also the pearle; all blessings belonging to this life and a better are in Christ made his, and he so rejoyces in them, as he referres the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and strength that he receiveth from them to the honour of God. Gods children recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving good things from him, are threatned for not rejoycing in them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.47. in the 45. verse he saith: <hi>The curses shall be upon thee, for that thou servest not the Lord thy God, with joyfulnesse, and gladnesse of heart, for the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all things.</hi> And it is expresly comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.11. <hi>Thou shalt rejoyce in everie good thing, which the Lord thy God hath given thee, and thine house.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But it may be questioned. Why (if this be true) are Gods children so disconsolate, none are so much troubled in conscience, as they?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1.</note>I answer, Their sorrow proceeds not from their good estate, in that they are Christians, but from the want of the perfections to make them absolute Christians indeed.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:17807:11"/>2 They either doe not know themselves, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> if they doe, because they glorifie not God, nor adorne their profession, God justly suffers his joy to be hid, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iding the comfortable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of his spirit.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Gods childrens joy, though it be great,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> yet is not discerned of the world, it is a hidden joy: the feast is kept in the conscience, it is not seene of the world, which discernes all things carnally: carnall joy is alwayes outward, and easie to expresse.</p>
            <p n="4">4 While Gods children live here, they have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ever a mixture of the two affections of joy, and griefe, to temper one another: for fulnesse of joy is onely in Heaven, this life will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure perfect joy, but ever when there is cause given of joy, we have something to humble us; and to keepe us from being exalted above measure. As <hi>Paul</hi> had some base temptation, which he cals the <hi>pricke of the flesh,</hi> who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bids us to feare and tremble, that we lose not the sense of Gods spirit, by the prevailing of our corruptions.</p>
            <p>But it will be objected,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ob.</hi>
               </note> that the Christian is fuller of sorrow than joy. To which</p>
            <p>I answer,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note> it arises either from ignorance of the grounds of comfort, or from want of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of them. When a man is a you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g Christian, newly begun, he knowes not, nor understands, what grounds he hath of joy; they are as children, that know not their inheritance at the first, nor their fathers love: especially if he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17807:12"/>
correct them, they thinke he loves them not. Even those that are growne Christians, faile too often in this, either by mis-applying the grounds, and mis-judging of their estate; or sometimes through the distemper of their body through melancholly. These judge of Grace by the <hi>measure,</hi> when they should judge by the truth of it, be it never so little. For it is not the measure, that is the evidence of the childe of God, but truth of grace. For there are degrees of grace, in some more, in some lesse, and in one more in one time, than in another. Take therefore a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian in his right estate, one that is a growne Christian, whom neither melancholy, nor temptation doth trouble, take him I say, as he should be, he doth rejoyce more soundly with true ioy, and hearty, than any one can, being an ungodly man, be he never so merry. How ever, this we may be sure of, a Christian hath the greatest cause to reioyce, and, as I sayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, hee ought to stirre it up in him by all meanes. And therefore how ever undisposed he be thereto, he ought to search what good things God hath wrought in him: if he doth not know his estate he cannot praise God as he should. He must meditate also of the vanitie of all worldly things, they vanish, and they that put their trust in them ever failed of any true joy, it never comes to the heart of a man, they are not deep enough to comfort men that meet with afflictions: they only touch the fancie, as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17807:12"/>
the fancie of a beast may be delighted.</p>
            <p>Let him also compare all discomforts that can come with this ioy in the Lord: and hee shall finde that it countervailes a world of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: this has no end, they are momentany, they last but for a night; this is in the Lord, in whom is fulnesse of ioy. This made the Saints of God so resolute, that they set light by all afflictions whatsoever: and therefore in their greatest afflictions they have the sweetest ioy and greatest comforts. And let him also consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that by this he avoides the reproach of religion, and shewes the force, and efficacie thereof to be such, as is formerly declared. And let him take heed of the hinderances of this joy. As first of all; of sinne committed and not repented: let him repent betimes, else it keeps a man dead, and dull, and backward: so long as this <hi>Achan</hi> is unfound, it will keep him in discomfort. Let him take heed of secret purposes either to sinne, or to favour himselfe in any one sinne (how small soever) for time to come. This will robbe him utterly of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, for joy cannot lodge in such a heart. <hi>If I regard iniquitie in my heart the Lord will not heare me,</hi> (saith <hi>David Psal.</hi> 66.) Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, let him <hi>take heed of negligence in good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> For it is not enough to doe them, but he ought to stirre up the graces of God in him, to doe them thorowly; and he must strive against his corruptions. For Christians have never so much joy, as when they have laboured with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17807:13"/>
their endeavours to overcome their imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in good actions.</p>
            <p>Lastly, let him <hi>take heed of casting himselfe into dull or dead acquaintance.</hi> It is true, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoid conversing with them, but we must have no secret and inward acquaintance but with the best: a companion of fooles shall be beaten, and the wise with the wise will learne wisedome. We are all travellers to Heaven; let us therefore chuse such company, as may (as it were) be a chariot to carry us thither, with their good example and discourses: And with the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> thinke it a great griefe when we have not such society as may doe us good.<note place="margin">Psal. 120.5</note>

And this lively remembrance of things, is wrought chiefly by repetition, and often infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the same things; and it makes the minde to be wholly taken up therewith. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a good way when we would doe any good action well, to be taken up with reading, or hearing of good, by way of preparation thereunto.

For
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17807:18"/>
their behaviour <hi>towards men, whom they goe about to seduce,</hi> they fawne on them, and use all manner of inticing, flattering, and false al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.18. See the picture of a Iesuited Papist, a pleasing, humane, fawning nature, they creepe into houses, and when these dogges cannot prevaile by flatterie, then they snarle, and barke against them, by false calumnies, and slanders, and railings, and bitter scoffes, and the like; and this they doe when they cannot bite. But having gotten power in their hand, they persecute with fire and sword, and the most exquisite torments that they can devise. <hi>In regard of themselves also they are Dogges,</hi> rotten in nature, corrupt in life, filthie in their owne Courts: devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their owne vomit, and God justly puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing them, by suffering of them to heape up wrath in store, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. and to returne with the sow that was washed, to wallow in the mire of corrupt courses. Hence wee may observe, and see, what a man is now brought to by sinne: he that would be like to God, is justly compared to the beasts that perish. Now all by nature are no better than dogges, who are all for their bellies, for present content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, an envious and currish disposition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any that shall indeavour to crosse them in their unlawfull lusts: and that rule of reason which should over-rule him, and amend him, he so abuses it, as thereby he is made more like a <hi>Divell</hi> than a <hi>Dogge.</hi> Would wee be then

Morall precepts may restraine and al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter outward practises; the Word that alters the condition and nature of men, it is the word of him that workes all with his spirit.

Our Fathers were troubled with them: let these take heed, for were these men dogges that presse Circumcision with Christ; and shall not such be also, that presse merits with Christ, Saints with Christ, and equall traditions with the Word of God. The dogges in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> time, had some excuse: Circumcision they urged, but it was first foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by God; but these men out of their owne braine endeavour to establish fancies: and where they cannot prevaile by conference, they by scattering of Bookes seeke to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish

So these <hi>Neuters,</hi> let them fawn never so much, let them halt betweene two opinions never so long, they shall at length know that they have betrayed their Religion, &amp; desperation shall at length assuredly overtake them, as it overtook <hi>Spira.</hi> Take heed of them, there hath beene a continuall brood of them in the Emperours time: the Iewes had some li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty granted to them, because their ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies carried a shew of a reverend antiquitie.

                  </gap>e thy selfe, <hi>whether thou makest conscience of private closet duties?</hi> Of prayer in thy studie when none sees thee? Of thy very thoughts?

                  </gap> thou omit no place nor time, but alwaies and in all places thou wilt worship God. This must be done, for God is alwayes and for ever God and he is in all places, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate as well as publike<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:17807:31"/>
heart must be the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> where God must remaine present continually, and therefore he makes conscience of, and is humbled for the least sinnes, yea those that the world esteemes not of, and counts them as niceties, and that in as great a measure as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily men are, for the greatest sinnes they commit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Canst thou indure the search of thy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> selfe?</hi> and thy infirmities by all meanes, by thy selfe, by others, by the word, by private friends? Nay, canst thou desire this search, that thou maist know thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Canst thou truely appeale to God, as <hi>Peter</hi> did to Christ, thou knowest that I love and preferre thee above all? It is a sure signe of thy sinceritie which the world cannot have: and therefore when they see their sinnes laid open, they spurne at the ordinances, and spite the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and their true friends, that put them in minde of their faults, accounting them as their onely enemies. Surely they shall never be able to indure the search of God hereafter, and the last day when he shall lay them open, they shall be overcome with shame.</p>
               <p>A fourth signe is, <hi>That at the houre of thy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4:"/> death, this spiritual worshipping of God will give thee content, when nothing else can:</hi> Thou mayst say with comfort as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did; <hi>Lord remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how I have walked before thee in sinceritie.</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:17807:32"/>
When down-right affliction comes, outward verball profession vanisheth, with all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts thereof, then perisheth the hope of the hypocrite. Two things upheld <hi>Iob</hi> in comfort, in his great extremity: he was first assured, that his redeemer lived: and secondly, he knew his innocency in those things that his friends char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him with: and such times will fall on us all, either at the time of death, or before, when nothing but innocencie, and sincerity shall be able to uphold us.</p>
               <p>Labour therefore for sincerity and spirituall worship, <hi>Worship God in spirit,</hi> but let it be done outwardly also. But first, bring thy heart and intention to what thou dost, and that will stirre up the outward man to its duty, and for the performance hereof,<note place="margin">Helps unto spiritual wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</note> follow these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, <hi>learne to know God aright:</hi> For wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is answerable to knowledge, for how can we reverence God aright, when we know nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his goodnesse, nor his greatnesse? how can we trust on God, when we see not his truth in the performance of his promises, in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and in our owne experience: those that doe not these, know not God, for as the heart affects according to knowledge. So also its true in divinitie, as we know his justice wee shall feare, as we know his mercy wee shall love him, and as we know his truth we shall trust on him. <hi>Psal.</hi> 9.10. <hi>They that know thy name shall trust in thee:</hi> and in other places of the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:17807:32"/>
said Psalme, the Lord is knowne in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he executeth, <hi>vers.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>know God to be the first mover <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and cause of all:</hi> men ordinarily feare the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, attributing that to it, which belongs to the Creator. But God, he is the giver of all, and Christians looke on the secondary means, as to the first author and ground of all the rest, they behold the Magistrate as in God: feare them no otherwise, but in the Lord. Atheists they will not sticke at any sinne whatsoever, to get the love of those, that may bring them any worldly commodity. A Christian, hee pleases, and seekes the love of him that can make enemies friends, when he lists, and when its for our good; he knowes, <hi>in him we live, move, and have our being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>make much of spirituall meanes:</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> God he works by meanes, by his word, attend to it: it works love, feare, joy, and reverence in us: and therefore, no marvaile if those that neglect these meanes, are not acquainted with these graces of Gods spirit.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Fourthly, <hi>Lift up thy heart to Christ, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> quickening spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. Our hearts natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are dead: Christ is our life, when thou art most especially called to love, to feare, to humilitie, pray to him to move thee, and yeeld thy selfe to him, and then shalt thou pray in spirit: as it is said in <hi>Iude</hi> 20. heare in spirit, doe all in spirit: doe outward workes of thy calling in spirit, for a true worshipper will out
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17807:33"/>
of spirituall grounds doe all outward works of his particular calling; as well as the workes of his generall Christian vocation. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe all things from our hearts to God, and to our neighbour: else will not God accept of our workes. It is the Iew inwardly, who shall have praise of God. The want of this sincerity, hath extinguished the light of many a glorious professour, and thereby hath brought a great scandall upon the true worshippers of God in spirit.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Signes of true Christian joy.</note>First, <hi>when we glorie, see the ground whence it arises, whether from God reconciled to us or not.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1, <hi>Signe.</hi>
                  </note> If otherwise: remember that of <hi>Ier.</hi> 9.23. <hi>Let not the wise man glory in his wisedome, nor the strong man in his strength,</hi> all such rejoycing is evill. <hi>But let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he understandeth, and knoweth me that I am the Lord.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Signe.</hi>
                  </note>Secondly, <hi>If we glory in the Lord, it will stirre us up to thankes:</hi> What we joy in we will praise: if we joy in Christ, we shall like the Spouse in Canticles, ever be setting forth the praises of our beloved. Thus did <hi>Paul, Ephes.</hi> 1.3. and <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. and therefore where dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and dulnesse is, it shewes no true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian joy.</p>

                  </note>Thirdly, <hi>Our glorying will be seene in dutie:</hi> delight ever implies the intention to doe any good worke, and diligence.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4. <hi>Signe.</hi>
                  </note>Fourthly, <hi>if we glory in Christ aright,</hi> we shall not indure any addition to Christ; and therefore we shall abhorre that Popish Tenent, which puts so many additions to Christ, in the meritorious worke of our salvation. A true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycer in Christ, sees such all-sufficiency in Christs merits, and worke, that he abhorres purgatorie and such trash: and so much the more, by how much his glorying in Christ, is the more fervent and sincere. Christ is our husband, we are his spouse: if we cleave to any
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:17807:36"/>
other, than to Christ, we are adulterers. No, let him kisse us with the kisses of his mouth, and none but he.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. <hi>Signe.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>this joy where it is, it will breed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in all estates: Paul</hi> could want and abound, and so can a true rejoycer: in Christ he hath all, he cares not for earthly wants, so he wants no heavenly comfort; if he be poore, he is rich in heaven; nay what he most complaines of are good for him, life or death, all's one with him, Christ is his, and in him all things.</p>

               <head>VERS. 3. And have no confidence in the flesh.</head>
               <p>THese words are in truth included in the former: for he that glories in Christ, <hi>will have no confidence in the flesh.</hi> But the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle notes this as a plaine demonstration and evidence of the glorying in Christ. For by the copulative conjoyning of them, it is all one as if he had said: what a man trusts to, he glories in, and what he glories in he trusts to, and is confident of. If in wit his glorying be, he trusts
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17807:37"/>
to it though it be to his ruine; as it fell out with <hi>Achitophel.</hi> If in eloquence of speech, hee trusts to it, and it brings shame, as it did to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod.</hi> If in honour, hee trusts to it, and brings himselfe to dishonour, as <hi>Haman</hi> did.</p>
               <p>By <hi>flesh,</hi> is meant outward things, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives, priviledges, actions of a mans owne doing, and particularly, he aimes at Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, which he calls outward, and that of the flesh. So as the observation that wee may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is: <hi>That confidence in Christ, takes away confidence in outward things.</hi> The reason is: if Christ be fully all sufficient, what need is there of any outward thing to put confidence in? For these are two opposite things, and one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrows the other.</p>
               <p>The second instruction is, <hi>That naturally men have confidence in outward things</hi>:<note place="margin">

                  </note> for having not hearts filled with grace, they relish not Christ, but flye to ceremonious outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as their refuge. Nay, <hi>in the Church, till we be converted, we naturally flie to outward fleshly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. We have the Word</hi> taught to us, we come to heare it twice on the Lords day: alas what is this if thou be not transformed, and inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and outwardly conformed in obedience? <hi>Hast thou the Sacraments</hi>? dost thou uncover thy head, or bow the knee? these are good, and they seeme faire: but where is the heart? how is that prepared? hast thou an earnest desire to leave off thy course of sinning? and dost thou resolve hereafter to amend thy life? O here is

the hard spirituall worke. So, in <hi>outward fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and abstinence, its an easie matter, the Pharisee did it often: but this is the fast that God hath commanded, to loose the bands of wickednesse, <hi>Esay</hi> 59.6. to fast from sinne. <hi>The suffering of the flesh,</hi> if it be separated from spirituall use, <hi>and almes,</hi> they profit nothing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3.

               <p>Circumcision was the first prerogative be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> conversion, and it was not before the eighth day, to the end, that the childe might ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther some strength to beare, and indure the

ceremony, for it was of it selfe grievous, and a bloudy ceremonie. Wherefore it was that <hi>Moses</hi> his wife called him a bloudy husband: and this ceremony was not to be respited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove eight dayes, that the parents might not be delayed in their comfort. Whence we may gather, that dying before baptisme is no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary impediment to the salvation of the childe: for the same covenant is annexed to circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that is, to baptisme: and the Papists that hold, that the death of children before baptisme hindreth the salvation of the infant, may as wel hold, that all the children that dyed before the eight day (being the day of circumcision) were damned. Secondly, observe this; that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, though infants, may, nay must bee bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, if it may be with conveniencie; for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were circumcised, nay they were injoyned circumcision on the eighth day.

                  <hi>It is good therefore to teach by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples</hi>:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> does here inforce rules by his owne experience and example.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is also expedient sometimes, to speake of prerogatives, and priviledges that a man hath in himselfe,</hi> and its not universall that wee must not speake of any thing, that might concerne our owne praise. For we may doe it as St. <hi>Paul</hi> does here, to beat downe the pride of others, that are vaine glorious; or wee may as <hi>Paul</hi> does, lift up our selves to abase and beat down our selves the lower.</p>
               <p>In the third place, <hi>when God vouchsafes his children any outward priviledges, he doth it for the good and helpe of others,</hi> though we see it not at the first. <hi>Paul</hi> had these priviledges, that hee might beate down the pride of the Iewes more powerfully. And <hi>Solomon</hi> had all abundance of wisedome, riches, and the like; why? But only that he might without controule judge of all, as of <hi>vanitie and vexation of spirit</hi>: and make it to bee beleeved more firmely. For had an
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:17807:42"/>
ordinary man said it, men would have thought its easie for him to say so: but if he had tried the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he would have been otherwise minded. In these latter times, our best teachers were at the first Papists, and of the more zealous sort: As <hi>Bucer</hi> and <hi>Luther,</hi> being also learned men; as also <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> and <hi>Zanchius,</hi> was brought up in Italy, and all this, that they seeing once their blindnesse, might be the more able to confound them, as being not a whit inferiour to them in any outward respect whatsoever, when they were of their beleefe.</p>
               <p>In the fourth place, <hi>God</hi> (having to deale with men of a desperate condition) <hi>suffers great and famous men to be in ignorance, nay to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors, that after their conversion they might comfort weake Christians:</hi> and therefore let them comfort themselves, doe they finde that their sinnes are many, and great? <hi>Paul</hi> was a Pharisee, a persecuting Pharisee, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued so a long while Nay, after his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, he complaines of a body of sinne, and yet found mercie, and therefore doe not despaire.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, wee see what St. <hi>Paul</hi> was, and what now he is, how his judgement is quite contrary to that it was; for where grace is, it makes men opposite to themselves: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this re-creation, is called a new creature. <hi>Paul</hi> quite contrary to <hi>Saul,</hi> and yet both one person. Out of which we may gather;</p>
               <p>First, <hi>That a man before conversion, hath ever that which is his gaine:</hi> for wee are prone to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17807:42"/>
thinke too highly of naturall things, and our esteeme shall be grounded upon probabilities, rather than we will lose our esteeme of them. For we know this outward gaine is easily got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the duties are easily performed; faire out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and will procure praise from men, which is all we naturally looke for.</p>
               <p>Secondly observe hence; That, that which we before conversion thought gaine, is indeed losse and unprofitable, nay it is dangerous: for things may in use be good, but in abuse dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Riches are good in use, but in abuse <hi>mammon</hi> and <hi>thornes,</hi> as Christ termes them. <hi>Circumcision,</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and <hi>Baptisme,</hi> in themselves were good, and many things are still good: yet when we trust in them, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect inward graces, sacrifice is no more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table than a dogges head. Good workes are in their proper nature good, yet if wee relye on them, they stoppe the way to Christ. So as it is our wicked and abusing affections, that hath brought an ill report on the good creatures of God, so as to us they are drosse, and dung, nay losse: these termes doth the holy spirit give to alienate our affections from these earthly things; an outward, civill, and conformable life, are, by our too high esteeme of them, stoppes, staying many from Heaven: for while they tell themselves they live honestly and justly, doing no wrong, they suppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be very Saints, and looke no further. But every true Christian knowes his infirmity,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:17807:43"/>
and the more he is inlightened, the more hee sees his darknesse: he knowes these things can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be gaine to him.</p>
               <p>For first, <hi>he knowes they are meaner than the soule:</hi> these are earthly, the soule is from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; these are outward, the soule is spirituall; and therefore is onely satisfied with spirituall and heavenly comforts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>A Christian sees these things are fading<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> arising of nothing, and tending to nothing; contrarily, he knowes his soule is eternall,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires comforts that may last with it for ever. For those that joy in these outward things, when they leave him, or he leave them, as of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie he must; its true they vanish to nothing: but he cannot, but must continue comfortlesse for ever, and undergoe the just wrath of God. Furthermore, a Christian doth not only know these things to be no gaine, but he also knowes them to be losse. <hi>For thats losse which a man findes by experience to be losse, when his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is awakened.</hi> But all things outward, what ever they bee, whether that a man is a Christian by profession, or that hee is a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, who hath good utterance, and is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced of the people, and approved of, or what priviledge else soever: when the conscience is awakened, they breed more horrour; at the houre of death when we are to give an account of them, and they set us further off from Christ. A prophane person is nearer conversion than a proud Pharisee: as Christ saith; <hi>the publican,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:17807:43"/>
and harlots, goe before you into the Kingdome of God:</hi> the reason is, because they that are thus outwardly affected, sing peace to their soules; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the prophane man hath no starting holes of excuse, his vilenesse being more manifest.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>God detests such boasters, more than those that are outwardly prophane:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ inveighes against such ever. <hi>Woe to you Pharisees, Hypocrites,</hi> and often threatens such with the punishment that is provided for hypocrites, as if those were the men which his soule ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orred, and for which onely hell was prepared.</p>
               <p>But how shall we be qualified, that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things may not be hinderers of us?</p>
               <p>First, looke to the foundation of all conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> consider <hi>the nature of God,</hi> and <hi>his law:</hi> by them we shall see a further degree of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, than the best of us can attaine to. <hi>The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of Gods nature is such,</hi> as Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have beene ashamed to be in his presence: As <hi>Iob</hi> when God spake <hi>abhorred himselfe. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> when he saw the power of Christ, said; <hi>Depart from me Lord, for I am a sinfull man.</hi> We are therefore to thinke often of the presence of God, before whom ere long we must all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Bring thy selfe to the spirituall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the law</hi>; as <hi>Paul</hi> did. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. See into thy thoughts, and behold the uncleannesse of thy heart.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>converse with those that are better
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:17807:44"/>
than thy selfe, and compare thy selfe with them.</hi> Not as the Pharisees, who compared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the Publicans: and herein are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deceived, and by undervalewing others, they over-valew themselves. For things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with lesse, they seeme somewhat; but with bigger, seeme nothing: it ought not to be so with us, let us compare our selves to that rule that we live by; and to such examples as we are to follow. Compare we our selves with Christ, our righteousnesse with his, and then shall we see our wants.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>Practise</hi> that which Christ so much beates on, that is, <hi>selfe-deniall:</hi> hate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, mother, world, nay thy selfe, or never thinke to come to Christ; they will be losse to thee, unlesse thou account them losse: the young rich mans wealth made him a loser: the love of the praise of men, kept the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees that they could not beleeve. Whosoever nourisheth any lust, it will rule him and his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, that he shall make it his gaine, be it never so vile in it selfe. But St. <hi>Paul</hi> being gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by another spirit, casts away all, and so must we; if we will not lose Christ, and suffer shipwracke, cast away these commodities that loade us and hinder us in our course. Neither is it meant here of an actuall casting away of our goods, thereby to establish the foolish vow of povertie; But herein is meant a <hi>judicious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning of the true worth of these things in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of Christ, and from thence a preparation,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17807:44"/>
and ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> solved minde, to part with all that may hinder us from the injoyment of peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the love of Christ.</hi> For a man may have a weaned soule, in the middest of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance: and he may live in the world, though not to the world, which is a dutie easily spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, yet not easily performed: neither was it easily wrought in our Apostle, who being a persecutor of the Church, was powerfully al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and changed from Heaven: and thus doth God deale with his children, whom hee doth first cast downe and afflict, that they may finde by experience, that these outward things can stand us in no stead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it may be hee suffers them to fall into some grievous scandalous sinne, that they might see the bodie of sinne that lies in them, and seeing no good, nor help in themselves, their desires are stirred up to the imbracing of some better thing, wherein they may finde comfort: then doth God reveale Christ to us, to whom he will have us to flie, and say: <hi>Lord what wilt thou have mee to doe?</hi> So as this power of changing our selves, is not in our selves, but it is an almightie power.</p>
               <p>If we thinke therefore that wee are selfe-lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, goe to God, present thy selfe in the meanes, and then our eyes shall be opened to see and discerne good and evill: For God hath promised to annex his spirit to the use of the meanes, if that wee in obedience submit our selves to them.</p>

eyes, new senses, new affections, and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; what they saw before to be gaine, they see now to be losse. Beasts we know conceive not of mens matters, neither doe weake simple men of state matters: that which weake silly men admire, the Apostle scornes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temnes. <hi>Moses</hi> accounted of the afflictions with the children of God, more than of the pleasure of Egypt. <hi>We may observe this as a marke to know our estates by</hi>: what is high in thy esteeme? is honour, riches, pleasure, or the like? thou art not yet throughly sanctified; for if thou wert, thou wouldst have a sanctified judgement.</p>
               <p>But some may say, did <hi>Paul</hi> esteem all things to be losse, yea his good workes?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I answer, good workes in their own nature are good: but weighing them with Christ, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, they are also drosse, and dung.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it teaches us, that <hi>wee are not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> righteous, or justified, by any workes ceremoniall, or morall, either before or after our conversion.</hi> The Papists alledge works as meritorious, we contrarily doe disclaime them. As to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: I (say they) you meane ceremoniall works: we say no, we meane also morall. For <hi>Paul</hi> was unblameable as concerning the works of the law, and yet counts them dung. O (say they) St. <hi>Paul</hi> meaned those works be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his conversion, and not those after his conversion. I answer, yes; all things in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Christ, I doe now account them as drosse, and losse. To prove this the fuller; <hi>If
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17807:47"/>
nothing after conversion bee perfect, then cannot they intitle us to heaven,</hi> but all our best works, in state of regeneration are imperfect: to prove this; See the examples of <hi>David,</hi> a man after Gods owne heart, <hi>Psal.</hi> 143.2. <hi>None righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in thy sight, and who can say his heart is cleane.</hi> And <hi>Esay</hi> 64.6. <hi>Wee are all as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane thing, and all our righteousnesse as filthie ragges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O but <hi>Bellarmine</hi> sayes, the Prophet speakes this in the person of the wicked. I hope he will not put the Prophet into that number; for he saith, <hi>wee,</hi> and <hi>our,</hi> and <hi>our righteousnesse</hi>; not <hi>our ill deeds</hi>; and <hi>all our righteousnesse.</hi> Nay of himselfe in particular: <hi>Esay,</hi> saith as much in <hi>Esay</hi> 6.5. And besides, the wicked doe not use to pray, as the whole Chapter is to that end. And <hi>Daniel</hi> also includes himselfe in his confession, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.20. And to prove this by reason; We know that weake and corrupt principles, must needs produce imperfect ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects: now the principles of all our motions, are evilly affected; our understandings, memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, affections, all are corrupt and weake. Corruptions make combates in all parts of the soule and body: in whatsoever therefore we doe, there is flesh and spirit; and their owne Authours agree hereunto: as <hi>Ferus,</hi> and <hi>Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren</hi> a <hi>Cardinall</hi> of their owne, sayes there is <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natajustitia,</hi> and <hi>inhaerens.</hi> When the question is what we must leane to, it must be onely on Christ and his righteousnesse, wherewith from
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17807:48"/>
him we are indowed. And a Pope of theirs, <hi>Adrian</hi> the fourth, saith that all our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse is as the reed of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which will not onely faile us if we rest on it, but will pierce our sides.

               <p>I answer.<note place="margin">

                  </note> A sick man cannot eate meat, but it breeds humours that strengthens the disease: shall he therfore forbeare all manner of meats? No, for meat strengthens nature, and makes it able to overcome the power of the disease. So by reason of our corruption we have within us, we halt in every good worke we put our hand to: shall we not therefore worke at all? Yes, for notwithstanding our weaknesse, though we merit not any good, yet God he over-lookes the ill-nesse of our workes, and accepts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the good that is in them, giving us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and assurance of our justification, by the sanctified fruites, which though imperfect, yet are true. To conclude, Seeing we cannot have Christ, putting any confidence in outward things: <hi>Let us labour to get an esteeme of the weaknesse and imperfections that are in them, as also in our persons, and actions:</hi> that wee may hunger after Christ. To this end, <hi>dayly renew
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:17807:49"/>
we our repentance, and examination of our hearts,</hi> and when we doe any good, <hi>Examine what weaknesse,</hi> want of zeale, want of affection or attention hath possessed us in our performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (of praying, hearing, reading the Word, and the like) and want of watchfulnesse in our courses, and then shall we be of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> mind, all will be naught. <hi>And take heed of spirituall pride, and conceit of any good in us,</hi> for it hinders spirituall comfort from us. Let us <hi>meditate of the greatnesse of Gods love to us, and the infinite reward,</hi> and it will make us ashamed of our weake requitance of Gods love to us. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>multitude of our sinnes, before the time we were called:</hi> and consider of our pronenesse to spirituall pride, let us by all meanes abase our selves. For those that God loves, he will have them vile in their owne esteeme: for it is his method; First, to beate downe, then to raise up. And therefore <hi>Iohn</hi> he comes thundering, <hi>Hypocrites, generation of vipers.</hi> Then comes Christ; <hi>Blessed are the poore, those that hunger and thirst after righteousnesse:</hi> as if onely they were blessed that feele their wants. We must disdaine any other titles to any good, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Gods mercy, and accordingly give the glory of all to him. Thus did the Church mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant, <hi>Not to us, not unto us Lord, but to thy Name:</hi> and thus doe the Church triumphant, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Honour, glory, and power, bee to the Lambe</hi>; those that doe not thus, are no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church.</p>

                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:17807:49"/>Last of all, <hi>Let us take heed of extenuating sinne</hi>: the Papists tell us of divers sins that are veniall, such are surreptitious thoughts, taking of pinnes, stealing of points, and the like; these they call veniall. But we must know, (to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, that sinne, as a sinne, to be veniall, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, though God doe pardon it, for that is out of his free mercy) these surreptitious stealing motions, that unawares doe creepe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, though the Papists doe make them of small account, God may punish with his fierce indignation. <hi>Moses,</hi> his anger kept him out of <hi>Canaan. Adam,</hi> his apple, cast him out of paradice, every sinne is a breach of the law, the least sinne soiles us, we must give account of idle words: and the wages of any sinne (though never so small) is death.</p>

                  </note>Ah, but is God thus hard to us, that he will not allow us the injoyment of the comforts of this life, but we must for them lose Christ?</p>
               <p>I answer, God denies us not our worldly comforts,<note place="margin">

               <p>And therefore we may well conclude from hence, <hi>that confidence in Christ and in outward things cannot stand together:</hi> wee cannot love God and Mammon, and therefore if wee part not with the world, looke to part with Christ; which we may note against the politicians of our times, that thinke themselves the onely wise men, in their esteeme <hi>Paul</hi> was but a weake man, and knew not how to esteem things, they can trust in God they hope, and yet provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the worst; the time will come, when they will finde they have been made fooles indeed, when God will say he knowes them not, and their riches shall take their wings and leave

them, without hope of comfort.</p>
               <p>And <hi>therefore let us acquaint our selves with Christs value, with the vanity of outward things,</hi> and meditate hereon, and at length thou shalt finde the same minde in thee, that was in St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the last place we may hence observe, <hi>who they be that have not gained Christ</hi>: for are there not many that will not part with a sinne, no though it be a sin that brings no profit or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure at all with it, as swearing and blaspheming Gods name, nay are there not those that (<hi>Iudas</hi> like) sell Christ for 30. peeces of money, nay, it may be for lesse. A goodly price to set hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, happinesse, and their owne soules at, let any man tell them hereof, they will sweare you do them open wrong, and be ready to cut your throat for saying so, how farre are these from true grace?</p>
               <p>The fourth and last generall observation is,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that when we <hi>have parted with all, we are to know that we are gainers:</hi> For Christ in <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.30. saith, (whose promises are yea and amen) That he shall have a hundred fold in this life <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> that is, so much content as shall be worth an hundred fold: for when a mans conscience can tell him, these and these things I parted with, onely to obtaine peace of conscience, that peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science shall give him more content, than the whole world can bring to him, and what can a man desire above content and comfort, its all we seeke for here, which if we have not, all is nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:17807:57"/>Secondly, he that hath Christ can bee no loser; <hi>for in him all things are, Eminently and Fundamentally:</hi> for he is Lord of all, and what I lose for his sake (if it be good for me) he hath said I shall have it.</p>
               <p>Hence we may see therefore, <hi>the wisest man, and the noblest spirit, who is the wisest man?</hi> He that makes the best choyce, its judgement makes a man: not hee that hath confused no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions swimming in his braine: Now a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an considers things, layes them together, jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of them duly; he therefore is the wise man.

                  <hi>our hearts will joy in him above all things:</hi> as he that found the jewell, went away rejoycing. <hi>Shew me the light of thy countenance, for therein doe I delight,</hi> saith <hi>David</hi>; where true beleefe is there is joy: <hi>Zacheus,</hi> the Iaylor, and the Eunuch, after they were converted they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced.

               <p>The third note is, <hi>if we can part with any thing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> for Christ,</hi> and indure any hard measure for the sense and assurance we have in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus: many are so farre herefrom, as they will not part with the least earthly pleasure for Christ; such as these, though they say they have peace of conscience, they lye, for they can have no more peace of conscience, than they have love to Christ, nor more love, than they have an esteeme of him above all things.</p>

               <p>The Phrase implies, first that there is an estate in Christ; Secondly, an abiding in it; and Thirdly, to be found abiding in him. For the handling whereof, wee will first explaine the phrase; Secondly, we will shew what doctrines it doth cleere, then we will come to some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions arising therefrom. The phrase, to be in Christ, is taken from plants which are graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into stocks, or from the branches which are said to be in the tree, thus are we in the vine; its Christs owne comparison, and of this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Christ, there are three degrees.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>First, we are in Christ, and in God, first lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us, and so wee were in him before wee were, he chose us from all eternitie.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, when Christ died, then we were in him as a publike person.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:17807:59"/>Thirdly, we are said most properly to be in him, now when we beleeve in him, and thus principally is the sense understood in this place: and thus we are in Christ, not as the manhood is in Christ, but mystically; not as friends in one another by love, but by faith wee are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted; as truly as the branches are in the vine, so are we one.</item>
               </list>

                  </note> if a tree did reach to heaven, and have its roote in the earth, doth this hinder that the branches and the roote are not united? In no wise. So Christ he is in heaven, and we on earth, yet are we united to him by his spirit, and receiving influence from him of all grace and goodnesse.</p>
               <p>Now lets see what doctrines <hi>are cleared <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> hereby:</hi> first, it cleares the point of <hi>justification by Christ:</hi> For if the question be, how wee are saved by Christs righteousnesse? I answer, Christ and we are both one, doth not the eye see for the bodie, are not the riches of the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife all one? yes, and even also whatsoever Christ hath is ours, he is our hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, he is our head. In the second place, it <hi>cleares the matter of the sacrament</hi>: the Papists would have the bread transubstantiated into the bodie of Christ, that it may be united to us. I answer, how is the foot in the head, is it not by spirituall vigour passing to and fro through
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:17807:60"/>
the body, but chiefly in the head: it is not therefore necessary that there should bee any corporall union. Nay, Christ comforted his Disciples more by his spirit when he departed from them, than he did by his corporall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. We say also, that the mysticall body of Christ is invisible, because the spirit whereby we are made one is invisible.</p>

                  <hi>This should comfort us at all times, and in all estates</hi>: before we were in Christ, we were in an estate of horrour, in an estate of damnation, now to be reduced to Christ: (what comfort is it to be one of a politique body its but for life, or to be in any mans favour its but at will) this is a most excellent, glorious, and eternall being, that mans nature should be so highly advanced as to be unit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>In all crosses or losses,</hi> what though we lose other states, here is a state cannot bee shaken. Thirdly, <hi>in the houre of death wee are in Christ:</hi> and blessed are they that dye in the Lord; death that separates the soule from the body, cannot separate eyther from Christ. Fourthly, <hi>after death</hi> can it go hard with me that am in Christ, that am his spouse, I am in him in whom is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of comfort. Fifthly, <hi>in all wants here,</hi> I have him to supply all, hee will give what is necessarie; if we should have fulnesse of grace here, we should not desire to be in heaven here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.

me</hi>? that which thou dost to my members thou doest to me?</p>
               <p>In the fourth place, let us consider <hi>how this being in Christ, is a ground of doing of all dutie.</hi> I say therfore, it will direct us in duties to God, towards men, and to our selves.</p>
               <p>First, in duties towards God, <hi>how thankfull ought we to be to him:</hi> for taking us to himself, for being <hi>Emmanuel</hi> God with us, so that wee are become bone of his bone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For duties towards men, this ought to <hi>stirre us to duties of peace and unitie,</hi> shall wee be so unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall as to fall out with the members of our owne body, <hi>Non est concors cum Christo ubi est discors cum Christiano.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it ought <hi>to stirre us up to duties of respect to each other:</hi> considering they are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christ as we are, and shall so be found in him ere long.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this should <hi>stirre us up to charitie to the poore members of Christ:</hi> they being his members are fellow members, and in loving them and doing them good, we sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of Christ, this pride and high esteeme of our selves above base pleasures and lusts, this is commendable; and therefore the Apostle had good reason thus to account of these earthly things to bee <hi>drosse</hi> and <hi>dung.</hi> In the second place, this will teach us <hi>to see our residence in Christ, and growth in him:</hi> for if we be in Christ, wee will have an especiall eye to our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, that we be not feet of iron and clay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a golden head, as many base licentious drunkards and filthie persons esteeme of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: will Christ owne such members as these, think we? no, those that are in Christ Christ will be in them, discovering himselfe by ruling in them; his house is holy, if we bee of his house, we will not desire, grieve, nor affect, but by the sway of his spirit.</p>

               <p>And from the words this wee may learne; First, that <hi>a Christian is continually under Christs wing, till he be in heaven:</hi> else how could the

Now Christs sufferings are either for us as mediatour, or with us, as being our head, and we his members: As me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour he suffered death, which was onely for our good, we can have no trust in our death, as to deserve any thing thereby as he did: for by his death he appeased Gods wrath, and got his favour to us which we lost, and by it he san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies our sufferings, and puls out the sting of all our afflictions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it is with the <hi>Vnicorne,</hi> who

               <p>But there are other sufferings, that wee and Christ suffer joyntly, he as our head suffering with us his members; for as if the foot be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the head is grieved, so the Christians suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are called Christs sufferings: and a Christian must looke to suffer, if he be a lively member of the body of Christ.

It is therefore a good estate (though miserie in it selfe be not desirable) for Christ desired to die, and not to die; and so we in severall respects may doe: for if wee regard
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:17807:64"/>
death as a destroyer of nature, so is it not to be desired, but considering it as the will of God my father, so are we to desire it, and yeeld our selves to it: and accordingly wee desire not afflictions for their proper naturall good, yet in regard they are a meanes to prepare and fit us for heaven, we say with <hi>David</hi> its good for us to be afflicted.</p>
               <p>In the second place, <hi>this will teach us that we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> are not to feare any thing that we shall suffer</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there are more with us than against us. <hi>Ioseph</hi> in the dungeon, <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Egypt, Daniel</hi> among the Lions, the three children in the fire, <hi>Paul</hi> in prison, feared not danger: for what ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red they, so long as they knew God was with them, and therefore they rejoyced; if we have Christ we have all, if we want Christ we want all.</p>

               <p>THis conformitie here meant, is not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the end, <hi>that as Christ dyed for sinne,</hi> so should we; but in the <hi>manner of suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> as he did suffer and die, so must wee suffer and desire death.

Secondly, dead mens senses are not delighted with faire and sinfull objects, if we be dead with Christ, let the sinfull objects bee never so delightfull, they will not move us or affect us one whit, nay, they will be distastfull to us. Most are of a contrary minde, offer them good discourse and occasions, they cannot

               <p>First, its <hi>honourable to bee like Christ our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> our head, our husband.</p>

he will make us like him, hee will prepare us hereby for glorie, feare not therefore, God will turne all thy troubles to thy good.

God will have us to stay while all his familie of blessed Saints shall meet together, as well us that are now alive, as our seed and posteritie after us.</p>
               <p>In the third place observe, that the Apostle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> makes resurrection of the dead the last thing:
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:17807:67"/>
                  <hi>establishing thereby an order,</hi> that there must be meanes to the resurrection, and then the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection it selfe. <hi>Ought not Christ to suffer these things, and so to enter into his glorie: Math.</hi> 28. And if we suffer with him, we shall also reigne with him: the second resurrection must begin with the first, we are sonnes and Saints hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but so we must also be here, onely a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there will be in degree of holinesse: this resurrection doth not follow every manner of life, although men ordinarily expect a crowne without crosses, and never looke for justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and sanctification, but thinke they shall be in heaven at an instant without them. But we must suffer with Christ in Mount <hi>Calvarie,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee come with him to the Mount <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> In the fourth place, wee may likewise note, that <hi>its hard to come to heaven:</hi> because of this order established by God, not in comparison of the end, for that surmounteth in excellencie the hardnesse of the meanes, but in respect of the meanes, some by faire death, with many crosses in their life, some not by many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward crosses, yet have store of inward troubles of the minde, by reason of their inward cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption that doth trouble them: others by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent deathes and by martyrdome: the wayes are so many, and the meanes so diverse, as there is no certainty which way wee shall passe. As St. <hi>Paul</hi> knew not the meanes, so he cared not what the means were, for he was content to go
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:17807:67"/>
thither by any meanes: let the cup of affliction be never so bitter, the glorie insuing will swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten all.</p>
               <p>Away therefore with all idle and secure thoughts of sparing our selves: <hi>Pitie thy selfe,</hi> said <hi>Peter</hi> to Christ, but was answered sharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>get thee behinde me sathan:</hi> no, the way is very hard, we must come to health by physick, the end is so amiable, as it will sweeten all sowre meanes, and therefore its good for us to be afflicted; crosses bring at length the sweetest comforts. <hi>Denie wee our selves therefore, in Christs cause,</hi> know no bodie, looke upon God and Christs promises, and promise wee ourselves no more than God promises, its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our knowledge what God will doe with us, he promises no immunitie from crosses.</p>
               <p>Nay, the Saints and the Apostles chose cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and afflictions, rather than the pleasures of sinne, who were wise, and had triall of both kindes, and yet accounts these momentanie afflictions, not worthy of comparison with the glory that shall bee revealed, they were but light; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. And if wee would truly beleeve this, it would be easie for us to be resolved as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was, to come to heaven by all assurances, and to come to all manner of assurances, by any meanes: for no worldly thing can bring content, like these hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly assurances, of the presence of the light of Gods love, which the children of God will by no meanes lose.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:17807:68"/>Secondly, <hi>in all crosses let us not looke into the state we are in, so much as that we are going into:</hi> we are going to a Pallace, let us not bee deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the consideration of the narrownesse of the way that leadeth thereto. God will not suffer this fierie triall to consume any thing but drosse, and therefore let us with Christ suffer the crosse, and despise the shame, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>labour for a right esteeme of the things of this world:</hi> they are but momentarie and fading, yea our lives they are given to us by God, what if we part with them, if it be for his cause, he will bring us to a better life, which shall not be taken away from us, and this life we must part with ere long: and thus we ought to worke on our selves by often meditating of them, as the Saints have done.</p>
               <p>In the fourth place, <hi>we are to labour to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then three graces in us especially:</hi> Faith, to assure us that wee are the children of God, and that we have heaven and all things belonging there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, laid up for us; and we are to labour to see more and more into the valew of them: and then we are to strengthen our Hope, which makes us cheerfully to undergoe, and doe any thing for Gods cause, through our expectation of that which faith beleeves. Lastly, let us che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish our love of Christ; this made St. <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be dissolved, and to bee with Christ: which was best of all. And this love comes from Faith and Hope, and these together will breed a largenesse of heart, that cares for no
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:17807:68"/>
worldly thing, and will bee daunted with no affliction or crosses what ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But how farre are we here from?</hi> did St. <hi>Paul</hi> part with life? It pertaines not to us, no not to leave a new fangled fashion, nor an oath whereby wee teare Gods name dayly: alas, where is faith, what corruption is here over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, which of us will ever be of <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> minde, to become vile or base for Gods cause? where is he that will indure a scoffe or scorne for religion? let us beg of God this large spirit, and large affections, the children of heaven have a free spirit, basely esteeming all worldly things: <hi>Zacheus</hi> when hee is called cares not for his goods, nor <hi>Paul</hi> for his privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. The Stoicks commend this resolution in men, to be willing and readie to die: alas, crosses and afflictions <hi>Paul</hi> esteemed not, so as he might attaine to the resurrection of the dead: these are the things that the Stoicks feared most, and it was the feare of these made them so willing and readie to die, together with a base servitude to pride: but a Christian heart is more noble, it not only feares not these, but it contemnes them; yea cares not for life without afflictions, but with joy can undergoe all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of torments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let us therefore take heed how wee quiet our selves in our earthly dwellings here,</hi> supposing our estate to be happie, surely it is the maine ground of Apostacie; wee shall never come to see the price of religion, nor the excellencie of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:17807:69"/>
a peaceable conscience, nor the vanitie of these things, so long as we blesse our selves in them. And contrarily, <hi>let us exercise our graces in the dayly trials we meet with here:</hi> doth favour of great men, doth pleasure, profit, or honour, crosse and oppose thy conscience, let the peace thereof be preferred above all evermore; else shalt thou never come to <hi>Pauls</hi> holy resolution. And dreame not of a vaine emptie faith, thou hast no more than thou dost practise, its not <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> that will prevaile at the day of judgement, but Christ will be ashamed of them at the day of judgement, that made no more account of him while they lived, than to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre every vaine, idle, wanton delight and pleasure, before his honour.</p>

               <p>There is no absolute perfection but onely in God himselfe, yet in Christians there is a kind of derivative spirituall perfection, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth chiefly in the parts: a Christian hath this perfection, he hath all grace in some measure; we have no other perfection, no not so much as <hi>perfectio viae,</hi> though the Papists say they have it, indeed we are so far from it, that never could Christian keepe the rules of nature; much lesse can we attaine to the perfection of obedience to the law, for by it we are all cursed: nay in Christ none attaines to evangelicall perfection of grace so as thereby wee can be justified, as by a worke of our owne, for our righteousnesse is but in part; and this <hi>perfectio viae,</hi> which they boast of so much, differs not from their <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio finis,</hi> no more than love to a man raised by good report of him, differeth from love cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the good I finde in him, by personall communicating with him; and this is onely in degrees in nature, they are the same love.</p>

               <p>I answer, love, in the abstract being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, is the fulfilling of the law, but in this or that subject its not perfect: <hi>Pauls</hi> love, nor <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> love was not the fulfilling of the law.</p>

               <p>Secondly, all Gods workes without us are perfect, as justification and glorification they are perfect, for we are perfectly justified even now, but his workes within us, such as are his sanctifying graces, are not perfected till our time of glorification: for he suffers the old <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> to be within us for divers reasons, so long as we live in this earthly Tabernacle.</p>
               <p>For use hereof, <hi>observe this as a ground for justification by faith. Paul, Rom.</hi> 5.9. proves, that even now he was justified, and in this place he denies and disclaims absolute perfection, and therefore could not be justified by it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must needs be justified by faith: if it were his case, it is much more ours, who come not
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:17807:70"/>
to that measure of the fulnesse of grace that hee attained to.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this may <hi>serve to comfort Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that finde themselves burthened with diverse wants,</hi> with dulnesse and frowardnesse of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and with manifold corruptions, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced thereby to call in question their Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an estate, let them looke upon a better patterne than themselves, they may bee growne Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and yet complaine with <hi>Paul</hi> of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Nay, the most strong Christians see most deeply and cleerely into their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and finde most opposition. There is in all men by nature, a spring of Poperie, they would faine deserve heaven by a perfect and holy life, without blot; and God to humble them, suffers corruption to checke them, and to keepe them under, who else would bee lifted up through good conceipt and esteeme of themselves.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it may serve as a caution to many, who being <hi>reproved justly for their faults, what</hi> (say they) <hi>we are not Angels:</hi> you have your owne imperfections as well as I. And stirre them up to any good dutie, they are presently so good, as those that are better than they, are too precise and too nice: St. <hi>Paul</hi> contrarily rests in no degree of goodnesse, but strives on to perfection: and its the devils sophistrie to turne that to a plea for negligence, which should stirre us up to be more diligent, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and carefull.</p>

               <p>THe word that is translated, <hi>I follow after,</hi> signifies properly to labour with earnest intention of the heart and affections: and the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that we may hence learne is, <hi>That the life of a Christian is a laborious and painfull life:</hi> for in what proportion the things we labour for, are more excellent than these worldly things, so much greater our desire and labour should bee in the obtaining of them, than in the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this worlds goods: and to this end, the Scripture ever inforceth this dutie with words sutable to our worke; <hi>Labour for the meat that perisheth not, strive to enter in at the straight gate, give all diligence to make your calling and election sure.</hi>

               <p>Those that will take no paines, its a sure signe they finde no sweetnesse in the thing, and therefore in such there can bee no true good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; and hence we may observe a difference between the desires of men, some are effectuall, some uneffectuall; those that are uneffectuall commonly desire and delight in the thing they desire, but will none of the meanes: <hi>let me die the death of the righteous,</hi> sayes the wicked man, glory and happinesse is excellent, but the gate

But where true desire of grace is, there will will be joyned thereto an indeavour, with jealousie over our corruptions, with griefe and shame for them, and for our backwardnesse and want of goodnesse, for else hell itself is full of good wishes and desires: if we meane to be better, we must use all meanes, undertake all paines and travaile with vehemencie, even as those that pursue gains with delight, they follow through thicke and thin, especially if the gaine bee in the eye, and those that goe for companie, they are soone tired; and thus did <hi>Paul,</hi> hee went through fire and water, through all manner of dangers, good and ill report, his gaine is still in his eye, hee lookes not after the way, if by any meanes hee may attaine his desired marke.</p>

Its a grace co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehends a number under it, and therfore Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended all the law under love of God, and our neighbour. Thirdly, <hi>cut off all superfluities,</hi> men thinke they are happy, when they have much to doe, when indeed they were happie if they had lesse to doe then they have. Sathan he does as <hi>Cyrus</hi> did with the waters of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> hee diverts and separates our affections, that hee might passe over.

For shame lets shew we have some respect of Religion and goodnesse, seeing God requires but one in seven; let us not bee so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, as to denie him his service on that day.</p>

The wicked they labour for hell, venturing losse of credit, strength, and estate, and is there not better gain in goodnesse? have we such rich promises and doe we esteeme of them no more, are not the afflictions wee shall meet with many and great, and doe wee thinke to undergoe them with ordinarie grace, gotten without labour and watchfulnesse?

               <p>
                  <hi>That I may apprehend.</hi> Whence we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, <hi>that the maine scope of a Christian is to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend Christ</hi> here by revellation, that we may apprehend him hereafter by vision: many there are that may follow good things, and use good meanes, yet wanting these apprehending gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of faith and love, (which makes us have communion with Christ) they perish notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing: humane knowledge is commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet is it no other than as a scaffold in this building, it helpes, but the building once done, its for little use; apprehend we therefore him by knowledge of his truth, relye on him by faith, and imbrace him by love: and then if we be chased by him, we may as <hi>Ioab,</hi> lay hold on the hornes of the Altar Christ Iesus, and there live and die, and as we have dayly brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, even so get more and more hold on him,

and this will make us desire with <hi>Simeon; Lord let me now depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation.</hi> Let us therefore dayly learne to see our owne foulnesse, and goe to him the rock of our refuge.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi>
                  </note>I answer, yes; for the armes of faith are large, it takes hold of things past and to come, no height is out of the reach thereof: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, Christ he is present with us, he is in his word, in the Sacraments, in the Communion of Saints; where two or three are gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in my name, I will be in the middest of of them, its his owne promise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For which I am apprehended of Christ: Christ he apprehends us, and that in severall degrees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, <hi>as he is God:</hi> In his eternall love wee had a being before we had any being here, God conceived us in his eternall affection, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced us. Secondly, <hi>Christ apprehends us in his effectuall calling of us: Paul</hi> he was posting another way, when Christ called him, <hi>Saul, Saul</hi>; others hee calles from their mothers wombe, some by afflictions and powerfull crosses, as he did the Iaylor, others by more gentle meanes, as <hi>Lydia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>there is an apprehending in all our actions, courses, and estates,</hi> directing us continually in them, never leaving us; none can plucke us out of his hands, hee is stronger
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:17807:73"/>
than our corruptions, he will not let us goe till he hath drawne us up to heaven, and placed us with himselfe; for the use of this doctrine more shall be said in the next doctrine, which is taken from the order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Christ he first apprehends us,</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>then we apprehend him:</hi> he apprehends us that we may apprehend him, and because hee hath apprehended us, therefore is it that we apprehend him: for <hi>in him it is that we live, and move, and have our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>; and therefore much more <hi>our best being:</hi> he it is that gives us the will and the deed, to us it is given by him to beleeve, and suffer with him.</p>
               <p>For use hereof,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 1.</note> it would teach us <hi>in all our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to beg ability and strength of him,</hi> and get a perswasion that his spirit doth apprehend us in love, and that he will direct us, and remove all impediments, and stand by us in all our cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, that we are able to doe nothing but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection from him, that though wee are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally dead and dull, yet he will quicken us by shining on our hearts with the sun-shine of his grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>give him the praise of all the good thou doest, for the deed is his:</hi> those that doe not, doe apprehend, and are apprehended of themselves: and therefore it may serve as a <hi>marke to discerne of our estate, whither doe wee runne? and what doe wee apprehend in our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</hi> is it Christ who is our present help in time of trouble? then there is a blessed change in
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:17807:74"/>
us, but doe we seeke to our owne devices, to our owne policies and inventions? surely wee have not apprehended Christ as wee ought to doe, and therefore wee are to stirre up the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in us, and beg increase of grace from him that is the fountaine of all grace.</p>
               <p>In the next place, it should <hi>comfort us, by the consideration of the certaintie of our estate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out falling away, if we hold fast unto the end:</hi> if it were ourselves that did apprehend us wee could not long continue, but it being Christ that holdeth us, our comfort is he will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake us; its the mother that holds the childe, the childe cannot lay hold on the mother, but is subject to falling every houre: Christ hee holding us, hath promised to love us to the end, and to put his feare in our hearts, that we shall not fall or depart from him: this being dayly considered, will greatly comfort a weake Christian, Christ may seeme to let him fall by suffering him to fall into some great sinne, but it is onely to humble him, and to teach him not to trust to his owne strength, which will soone faile him, but upon his mercie and grace: And therefore,</p>
               <p>In the next place, it <hi>teacheth us to hold fast un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and relye on him, and to pray to him that he would hold us fast.</hi> and then we fall not from God, but to God, hee hath delivered us, and will deliver us and keepe us to his heavenly kingdome: if we fall into sinne, let us repent and goe to God, there is mercie in Israel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:17807:74"/>
this and with him is plenteous redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his right hand is under us ever to hold us up, that we cannot fall so deeply but hee will lift us up againe.</p>
               <p>In the next place, <hi>this may be a comfort to us in all our troubles and afflictions of this life:</hi> Are troubles neare? God is not far off (<hi>Psal.</hi> 22. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 118.) But full of comforts for such: we have an invisible wall about us, the wall of Angels, and God fights for us, there is more with us than against us, God will not suffer us to be tried above that we are able to beare: let us therefore pray, forsake me not Lord, lest I forsake thee: if wee pray to him he will bee found of us. <hi>Paul</hi> prayed for this. Christ also that knew he was apprehended, yet prayed all night; and this are we to doe: he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, to heare us. And therefore let us goe in faith and assurance to him, in all our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>

And another reason why we apprehend Christ not so fully here as wee shall doe hereafter, is, because the manner of making Christ knowne to us, is by revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 13. We behold him here but as it were in a glasse, in the glasse of his Word and Sacraments, which cannot represent him to our understanding so cleerely, as hereafter we shall behold him in the beatificall vision.</p>

                  <hi>Take heed therefore of a selfe conceipt of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>: when we begin to be unwilling to grow better, we begin to waxe worse, there is no stay in Christianitie.

               <p>But from the similie, wee may gather thus much; <hi>That Christianitie is a race,</hi> the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of</hi> this race <hi>is at</hi> the <hi>beginning of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,</hi> it should begin at our baptisme: the first thing we should know ought to bee God, the race <hi>is the performance of good duties, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our generall calling,</hi> and concerning our <hi>particular.</hi> For the length of our races, some are longer, some shorter, but the end of every mans race is the end of his life: some mens wayes are plainer, some rougher, <hi>the prize is fulnesse of joy</hi>; the lookers on, are heaven, earth, and hell, God is the instituter of this race, and the rewarder; the helpers, are Christ, good Angels, and the Church, which helpes by prayer; the hinderers are the devill and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, who hinder us by slanders, perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, and the like. For ground of this race in us, we are to know that man is created with understanding, directing him to doe things to a good end and scope, other creatures are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to their end, as the shaft out of a bow, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man fore-seeing his end, apprehends meanes thereto: his end is to receive reconciliation
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:17807:77"/>
and union with God, to which hee aymes by doing some things, suffering others, and resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting others.</p>
               <p>And this race is also ordered by lawes, for every runner is not crowned, there is a running ill, that shall never procure the prize. The lawes hereof concerne either preparation, or the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it selfe; for preparation,</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Direct.</hi>
                  </note>First we are to know, that <hi>there is a dieting</hi> requisite, as those that runne in a race, have a care hereof, to use such diet as did strengthen not cloy, and such apparell as might cover them, not clog them; so ought it to bee in our spirituall race, we <hi>must cast aside all heavie loads,</hi> every weight and sinne, which doth so easily beset us; as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. If God cast on us any place or riches, let us use them for a good end, but not make them our end, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with them take up dayly examination of our selves, how we behave our selves towards these worldly things. It were a madnesse in a runner, in his race to take up a burthen, and not to thinke it will be a sore trouble to him, and why doe we not think thus in our spirituall race? Cast we off therefore originall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the corruption of our place, time, and calling, which in time will grow unsupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to us. Let us desire no more than God gives, and what afflictions God sends us, let us take, assuring our selves they are for our good.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>A second law is, <hi>to consider the wayes that we are to runne in,</hi> what dangers wee are like to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:17807:77"/>
meet with, forecast and resolve against the worst, and withall promise we our selves Gods assured protection in our worst estate, the want of this is the seminarie and ground of all Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacie, when men promise to themselves in Christianitie, such things as God never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised. Christ therefore promiseth, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the worst first: but the devill to deceive us keepes the worst out of our eyes, and shewes a sort of vaine delights and pleasures, but the sting of them (through his subtiltie and craft) he suffers us to feele before we see it.</p>
               <p>A third law is, that <hi>we enter the race betimes,</hi> its the devils tricke to put off the care of this,<note place="margin">3.</note> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us, we need not yet enter, we are but yong and have many yeares to live, as they did that hindered the building of the Temple, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider wee the uncertainty of our life, that wee may die suddainly, and that its just with God to take us away after that manner, if wee neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect our selves and him; and we must know al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, we shall lose no pleasure nor delight, but we shall finde such sweet delights in those wayes, as we shall with St. <hi>Augustine</hi> be greeved that we enjoyed them no sooner. And besides, those that begin betimes get a great advantage of others, and through continuall custome, come at length to a habit of Religion.</p>
               <p>In the next place, we are to take heed of hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances of us in our preparation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as</p>
               <p>First of all, <hi>hope of long life,</hi> whereby we are besotted, thinking life and death is in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:17807:78"/>
that we shall have time enough, and need not so soone enter upon good duties.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Hind.</hi>
                  </note>Secondly, <hi>a conceit that when wee</hi> have once given up our names to Christ, that presently we bid adieu to all delight, mirth, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, when alas we are farre deceived; God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies not pleasure to us, but will give us what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is good for us, we shall delight and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, but with a joy spirituall, and wee shall see nothing in this world, that may any way deserve our delight therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3. <hi>Hind.</hi>
                  </note>A third hinderance, is a dispaire of ever go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through this race; this settles upon some strangely making them cast away all care, and desperately trust to Christs mercie. This made <hi>Cyprian</hi> to complaine of his corruptions, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they were bred and brought up with him, and therefore feared they would hardly give place to grace, being but a stranger; while men consider how great and powerfull their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is, they with the Israelites despaire of ever entring into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> these sons of <hi>Anak</hi> doe so terrifie them.</p>
               <p>But consider we withall, that God is above all our corruptions, that he can make of a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Lambe, and that if wee will trust upon him, in his time he will helpe us, and wee shall overcome these Giant-like corruptions, Christ he hath conquered them already, and though while we live wee cannot wholly overco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e them, yet <hi>Davids</hi> house shall grow stronger and stronger, and <hi>Sauls</hi> house weaker, we shall
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:17807:78"/>
have grace sufficient for us: God will sweeten Religion to us, that wee shall delight therein, and Christ will not leade us into temptation, till he hath fitted us to it <hi>by his grace,</hi> and then we shall rejoyce as the Apostles did <hi>Acts</hi> 5. that we are accounted worthy to suffer.</p>
               <p>Contrary to this humour, some thinke it so <hi>easie a matter to runne this race,</hi> as they thinke they cannot be out of it, or tired therein, when as indeed they never set foot therein; let such looke to themselves if they be in this race, they shall finde it no easie matter.</p>
               <p>But thus much concerning rules or lawes for preparation to this race, now there are lawes to be observed of those that are in the race, as</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Direct.</hi> 1.</note> they <hi>must resolve to hold on without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance</hi> of their course of good duties, for some by omitting good duties, now and then upon slight occasions, do come through Gods just sufferance to leave them off, and never take them up againe, and thereby whiles they are not getting ground by continuing their course, they doe lose thereby, even as water-men rowing against the streame, if they doe not row but rest never so little, the streame car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries them backe againe, and they cannot reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themselves, but with great difficultie: so it is in this Christian race, a little interruption of dutie, causes thrice so much paines to recover our former estate; therefore we are to take up a holy resolution, not to be interrupted in good duties.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:17807:79"/>The next law is, <hi>that wee must looke to gaine ground still to grow from grace to grace.</hi> Its the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles ayme still to grow better than himselfe, contrary to this many forsake their first love, they thinke themselves wise but are fooles, such as the Lord will spew out of his mouth, as he threatens the Church of <hi>Laodicea.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the most men at the best are but civill, and doe but provide for their owne ease, and can indure any mixture of religion or company, and the ground of this coldnesse is a selfe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, whereby men thinke well of themselves, and their estate; <hi>Paul</hi> he was of another spirit, ever pressing forward.</p>
               <p>A third law is, <hi>that we doe things with all our might,</hi> that we runne this race with all our ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest indeavour, there is no bodily exercise that profiteth, but it must be with putting forth of our strength; so our Christian actions should shew even outwardly, that we doe things as if we intended thereby to honour God indeed, and to this end wee are to depend on God by prayer, that he would give us strength, and mindes to put forth our strength, for gaining most honour to his Majestie, and this will bring great assurance and comfort to us in time of need.</p>
               <p>A fourth rule is, that <hi>wee are to runne this race with a cheerfull and speedie course</hi>: a dead performance of duties, is no part of our race, yea as many goe to hell by ill performance of good duties, as by committing sinnes that are
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:17807:79"/>
scandalously evill; for this resting in the work done, is the cause of hardnesse of heart, and there by of despaire, and at the best never brings any sound comfort at all to us: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are injoyned to doe good duties, and to doe them in a good manner, <hi>Let a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine himselfe and so let him eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup, and so runne that you may obtaine.</hi> Its no lingring, we know not how long we shall live, how soone we shall die, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us make haste to doe our worke, before God takes away time from us, by taking us out of the world. And those especially are to look to this, that have lived long in their owne cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and are but lately reclaimed, they are much behinde, and had need make haste, the journey is long, their time but short. And to this end, looke we not what wee have done, and how farre we have gone, but looke what remaines to be done, and know we have done nothing, till we have done all.</p>
               <p>But it will be asked,<note place="margin">

               <p>But men may say,<note place="margin">

all the paines we can any way take here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the comforts that wee have here are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which none knowes but them that injoy them. And God hath promised the continuall assistance of his blessed spirit, that shal incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage us and leade us into all truth, alas what comfort have we of all that we have done, if we continue not, but sit down and take up our rests here? what good got they that came out of Egypt and died in the wildernesse, it may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the border of the land of promise, yet never saw it?

                  </note>I answer, incouragement and this price are not given to workes, as workes, but as workes by faith, for by it wee runne and overcome all trials and troubles: reward is due to perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but perseverance cannot bee without faith.</p>
               <p>But for the matter in hand; I say its expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to looke to the price; that we be not carried away with temptations on the right hand, or on the left, and therefore let us not looke on them. <hi>Moses</hi> eye was so fixed on this price, as he set light by all the pleasures of this life; the eye of faith in a Christian, is stronger than that of sense, yet let us take these cautions. First, that we know ourselves sonnes, and that wee come to this price by inheritance. And second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we love not God so much for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to us, as for that goodnesse which is in him: for a Christian aymes first at Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, then at his owne good; and so hee loves God for being goodnesse it selfe, then for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good to him. And yet a Christian in order, comes first to see Gods goodnesse to him, and therefore loves him, and then he arises higher to the love of God, even for that he is good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and thenceforth admires and adores his fulnesse, for else to love God because God loves us, is mercenarie.</p>

                  <hi>Wee are therefore to thinke of this happie estate:</hi>

                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 1.</note> and as children, though at the first wee know not what belongs to inheritances and rewards, yet the elder wee grow in Christianitie, the more let us search into these things, and see what is laid up for us. It is an unvaluable price that will free us from all evill, of companie of enemies, of Sathans anoyances, of hinderances, of sinne, from all occasions without us, and inclinations within us, from sicknesse of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and troubles of minde: its a Saboth after sixe dayes worke. It is beyond all earthly crownes, the runners have envie not one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nay they helpe and further one another, and are glad of one anothers forwardnesse: all are heires, all happie, all shall be crowned, and with an incorruptible crowne, an inheritance that fadeth not, but is undefiled; and such an one as is kept for us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. Its not like the crownes of leaves that soone fade; no, we shall ever bee in the presence of the sonne of Righteousnesse, where we shall have a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all spring.</p>
               <p>But to proceed in the next place, <hi>this is a price of calling, we must be called to it:</hi> who can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> take a calling on him, unlesse God calles him? and who can be inabled but those that hee ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles? This calling of his, is the beginning of his golden chaine of salvation, hee calles us from a cursed estate, to a happy communion; from death and bondage under the devill, to be Kings and Princes. And this is done by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:17807:84"/>
meanes, and inward worke of the spirit, this calling is a powerfull calling, inabling them to come that are called.</p>
               <p>And hereby we may try, whether wee have any title to heaven or not;</p>

And whom God calles, he qualifies, Princes they may call men to places, but they cannot qualifie them. But God when he calles <hi>Saul</hi> to be a King, hee gives him a Kings heart, so if we be called to this heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kingdome, we shall have holy and Kingly hearts and mindes given us.</p>

                  </note>Thirdly, <hi>this calling is to glorie</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that is called, he will thinke of heaven, and magnifie and admire Gods goodnesse to

him, what thing is man Lord, that thou shouldst bee mindfull of him? and therefore those that admire the pompe and glory of this world, its a signe their calling is worldly, and that they are called by the world.</p>
               <p>Fourthly;<note place="margin">4. <hi>Signe.</hi>
                  </note> if a man be called by God, hee shall finde a spirituall answering within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to Gods call. If God say, <hi>thou art my sonne,</hi> the <hi>heart</hi> answereth, <hi>thou art my God. Behold I come quickly,</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>even so come Lord Iesus,</hi> saith the Christian heart.

               <p>Thirdly, <hi>this calling of ours is a high calling:</hi> its from heaven, to heaven; its from a heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spirit, by spirituall meanes to Christ in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to Saints, to spirituall imployments and priviledges.</p>
               <p>Hence therefore <hi>wee may learne who are the greatest men:</hi> sensuall men thinke those in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward place the greatest men of all other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alas they are nothing to a Prince of heaven, hee is a spouse to Christ, shall judge all the world, and triumph over Sathan. <hi>All other callings end in the dust with our bodies</hi>; Kings shall rise as Pesants, and it may bee in a worse estate than many of the meanest, there is no difference in death. All other callings are by men, from men, to men, to earthly purposes; let us make therefore a difference, and know whence our <hi>calling is, that we may be thankfull, and whether it is, that we may be joyfull.</hi>

                  </hi> for by nature we are dead, and it can bee none but God that revives the dead; God together with the voice of his Ministers, sends his quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning spirit, giving eares to heare, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings to understand.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And first of all, <hi>we must know there must bee an order</hi>; we are to grow in fundamentall gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the first place, for we water not the leaves
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:17807:88"/>
but the root of our plants, and the graces that are the foundation of all workes being gotten, and diligently cherished, the workes, which are but as leaves, will soone put forth. <hi>The maine fundamentall grace of all is faith:</hi> which we are principally to looke after.</p>
               <p>First, in getting assurance of our salvation; to this end walke holily, for many live in sinnes against conscience, and so can have no assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the pardon of their sinnes, and how dead and blockish are they? <hi>David,</hi> though a man after Gods own heart, yet losing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable assurance (by his sinning against con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science) of the pardon of sinne, thought Gods holy spirit had quite forsaken him, therefore he prayes; <hi>Take not thy holy spirit from mee, Psal.</hi> 51.11. Therefore labour for assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of pardon of sinne, for where the soule is wounded with the guilt of sinne, it cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large it selfe in love, but is possest with a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full expectation of judgement, but when the soule is assured of the pardon of its sinnes, it breeds love to Christ; and there its said of <hi>Marie,</hi> shee loved much for many sins were forgiven her.</p>
               <p>In the next place, we are to labour for faith in the promises of the forgivenesse of sinne, and Gods goodnesse to us: that hee will give grace and glorie, and that wee shall want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, this will put courage into us.</p>
               <p>And as we are to labour for faith, so <hi>also for love:</hi> which is cherished by meditation of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:17807:89"/>
Gods mercies, and his love to us, and this will set us on fire in all good workes, and so much of this grace as wee have in us, with so much strength and intention of spirit shall wee indeavour to please God in all things: and this argument the Apostle used to stirre up the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor</hi>: 7.1. <hi>Having these promises, lets clense our selves from all filthinesse, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holinesse in the feare of God.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> In the next place, <hi>Whatsoever wee doe, lets labour to doe it with the best advantage</hi>: labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to practice and exercise as much grace, and as many as we can; as in giving, give in zeale to Gods honour, in love to mercie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our brother that is in need, and in regard of justice, we owe it to him; God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to give him, and he will reward it, for we lend to the Lord, when wee give to the poore. If we are to abstaine from any evill, we are to abstaine from it with a perfect hatred thereof, and consider how it will offend, it will breake peace of conscience, and dishonour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, scandalize those that are weake, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour God, and bring shame to our selves: yea, wee must remember that the talents that God gives us do increase, in the use of them, the more we strive to doe things exactly, the more perfection we shall attaine to, in the use of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>Let us not neglect litle things either ingood or ill</hi>: omit no occasion of doing good, and take heed of the least beginnings of ill,

               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Wee must keepe our affections to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> exercises and meanes:</hi> for God workes by meanes; neglect none, for so much perfection thou losest thereby, and consider what meanes will fit our disposition when we are indisposed; are we dull in prayer? then reade; if that will not be endured, then use the communion of Saints,<note place="margin">Motives to the use of the meanes, and unto perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> and still remember that we be not wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with prayer, for God sends not his away emptie, and that those things may be the more effectuall, observe some motives to stirre us up.</p>
               <p>And to this end, consider the priviledge of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> a perfect Christian; <hi>He is as Mount Sion, which cannot be moved:</hi> if wee tell him of death, its his hearts desire, tell him of afflictions he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, he lookes for them, he knowes he lives Gods childe, and so he shall die: when a weak professor, feares afflictions, feares ill tidings, feares death, and when it comes, seekes for comfort, and hardly findes it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a perfect Christian is a <hi>beautifull <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> example, and makes others in love with Religion,</hi> he is throughly exercised and practised: the weakling is scandalous, makes men offended at Religion, soone takes offence, soone stumbles, and gets many knockes, so as his life is bitter.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the <hi>perfect man honours God, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> gets him much glorie,</hi> by hearing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reading, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and such duties; now as parents love those

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, the <hi>perfecter a man is, the more neere communion he hath with Christ,</hi> and hath the <hi>greater fruit of Christs love,</hi> and findeth peace of conscience, and joy in the holy spirit: to such as these, Christ hath promised to come and sup, and feast, and refresh with his graces, for even to this end Christ came, to make us holy and pure, that he might present us to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a glorious Church, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.26.27. and therefore that Christ may attaine to his end in us, let us indeavour unto perfection.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, <hi>our estate hereafter should move us hereunto:</hi> we looke for a new heaven, and a new earth, and we desire to be ever with the Lord, in that heaven wherein dwelleth righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, and therefore we ought to be diligent that we may bee found in him in peace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out spot and blamelesse.

               <p>ST. <hi>Panl</hi> aymes at the comfort of those that are weake, implying that every Christian stood not in this pitch of disposition with the Apostle, and yet they were not to be discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, God will reveale the same minde to them also in his time.</p>
               <p>In which words we may observe; first, that <hi>some Christians see not so farre as others, neither at some times so well as at other times</hi>: but are like the man in the Gospell, they see at the first men walke like trees, and after see things more plainly. <hi>The way of the righteous shineth more and more, unto the perfect day as the light doth:</hi> (saith the Wise man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.18.) And as the Church grew to knowledge by degrees, so do we, for we first know things in generall; at the first, <hi>Peter</hi> knew not that the Gentiles should be called, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. And the Disciples were at the first weake, and subject to many infirmities, and therefore we must <hi>take heed of judging and censuring others, and also that we discourage not our selves,</hi> by reason of our weaknesse, God willin his time strengthen us, and it may be call them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>observe it is God reveales this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such.</hi> It is God that must take away the vaile
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:17807:91"/>
first, <hi>the vaile of the thing,</hi> opening our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings by reading and hearing, and thus the thing it selfe is made fit to be knowne, then he opens <hi>the vaile of the heart</hi> and affections, to imbrace and love the things. Its God that ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the heart of <hi>Lydia, let us therefore beare with the ignorant,</hi> though Gods time is not yet come, it may hereafter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Ministers when they come to preach, must pray that God would take away the vaile from the peoples eares and hearts: and people when they come, let them pray that God would open their hearts</hi>: and not come in the strength of their owne wit, knowing that God openeth and shutteth, none can open or shut till hee doth it.</p>
               <p>In the third place, wee may observe, <hi>that God in mercie will doe this for us:</hi> hee will open our hearts; he will reveale, though not every particular truth, yet all necessarie truthes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our estates: some stand in need of more than others, as Ministers ought to have more than people, and Governours are to have a larger spirit than other inferiours, yet all shall have sufficient.</p>
               <p>Therefore for our necessities, let us goe to God, he hath promised to leade us, and with <hi>David</hi> pray; <hi>Lord open thou mine eyes, that I may see the wonders of thy Law:</hi> he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to anoint our eyes with eye salve, and its his office to guide us, he is our Prophet to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:17807:91"/>In the next place, <hi>observe that if any man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to God, he must at one time or other bee thus minded as</hi> Paul <hi>was:</hi> to hate all things as vaine, to strive on to perfection, to make conscience of the least offences, yea, of idle thoughts and words, of loose wanton behaviour, to know he is not perfect enough, vigilant enough, to look how farre hee is short of that pitch of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he ought to attaine unto, not to content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe that he hath out-gone others: these things they shall know either here in time of triall and temptation, or at the houre of death, when no man ever repented of his goodnesse or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse in Religion, nor of his care or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie in good courses.</p>
               <p>And therefore let us be stirred up to bee of the same minde now, and if any man shall think with himselfe, because God will reveale this, therefore he will neglect meanes, and stay till God inspires this minde into him; let such take heed, if they love goodnesse, they will set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it presently, but if they quench the good motions of Gods spirit, God will take his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from such. Beg that God would now change thee, for thou art not master of thy thoughts: if we now put off God till we die, its just with God to suffer us to forget our selves: let us bee well affected for the present, and though wee see not so cleerly as wee should doe, let us at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the meanes, and though we cannot grow in religion, yet let us not thinke it a shame, but allow and uphold such courses, else is our estate desperate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:17807:92"/>Observe further, this <hi>speech as its a discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of a moderate spirit in the Apostle,</hi> there are some graces that seeme in shew to crosse one another, as zeale and moderation, but they doe not, for zeale when it meets with a fit sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for moderation, can bee moderate: <hi>Paul</hi> condemnes not, but hopes; and its an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for our imitation, love beares all, and hopes all: whiles God suffers, why should not wee suffer? Christs spirit will not breake the bruised reed, in whomsoever it is: God hath a time for such as we condemne, even as he had a time for us, <hi>and therefore wee must use all meanes,</hi> way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting if at any time God will give us repentance. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. Ministers must not be harsh with weake Christians, its Gods worke to bow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and not mans.</p>
               <p>And secondly, when wee have used all the meanes we can, <hi>wee must depend on Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>: and therefore we are to fetch grounds of toleration and patience towards others, from Gods love and wisedome, who reveales the seed sometimes long after.</p>
               <p>The Papists, they checke us for want of meanes to reduce men into unitie, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound controversies, they brag of the Popes power this way, but its but a brag, for why doe they not conclude their owne?</p>
               <p>They are farre more happie than the Church was in Christs time; hee sayes, <hi>offences must come. Paul</hi> sees <hi>there must be errors,</hi> hee could not compose all, God must reveale it in his time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:17807:92"/>But how doe they compose differences? by excommunication, imprisonment, and death, and this by the censure of an ignorant man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, which is brutish and unfit for the Church of God. For our part, we want no meanes, but the effect or successe we must leave to God, we are not to force men tyrannically to our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in lesser matters, but leave them to Gods time of revelation.</p>
               <p>And lastly, as this hope of revelation is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, <hi>so are wee to expect it and waite for it:</hi> for to him that hath, more shall be given; and therefore let them that have beginnings of grace, bee comforted to walke on, and for those that are not entred, let them not be discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, God will reveale: But upon what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, it followes:</p>

implyes in generall the Scripture; more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, a company of sound truthes, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning faith, love, and hope There is a great Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble which is the whole Word of God, the little Bible is the grounds of Religion, and these are not onely to be understood in the Booke, but comprehended and invested in our understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and affections, and according to these we must walke. Truth is no guide to us being one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Booke, but as it is seated in the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
                  </note>But lets come to some observations; first, we may learne that God out of his goodnesse, <hi>hath left to his Church a rule of faith and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:</hi> there is a rule whereby men must walk, otherwise should we be in a labarinth of errors continually, having no other light but this torch-light of Nature, to guide us in this thick darknesse, wherein we are by nature.</p>
               <p>The properties of this rule are divers; First, its a <hi>fixt</hi> and unchangeable rule, and therefore we must bring all to it, not it to all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>this rule is a perspicuous and cleere rule, thy word is a lanthorne to my steps, and a light to my pathes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>this rule is homogeneall:</hi> all things therein are spirituall, all holy, all pure, and therefore when the question is about Religion, we must have recourse thereto, as the onely ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute compleat rule. And therefore we must know this rule, and then be led by it, for the word <hi>Rule</hi> implyes, that there must bee a thing
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:17807:93"/>
to be ruled, else what needs rule, or to what use should it serve? an instrument is in vaine without use: its true, many men make religion and Scripture, but a meere object of discourse. But their example ought to be no rule to us, if we looke to be saved, it must be by walking ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this rule, and therefore a Christian life is no licentious life, though hee be freed from the law, yet must he serve God day and night: therefore it is that the Christian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spers not, nor thrives in this world, because he will not lie, nor sweare, nor have a broad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, as the children of this world have, that take all occasion and scope to bee rich: but a Christian lives by rule, he hath little, and it is blest to him, for he lookes at riches and profits of another kinde.</p>
               <p>In the second place, wee <hi>may observe that a Christian walketh by this rule:</hi> he thinkes it not sufficient to take a step, but keeps a right course stedfastly onward.</p>
               <p>But how may this bee done?<note place="margin">How to walk according to the Rule.</note> may some men say.</p>
               <p>I answer, let us use the meanes; as first, <hi>let <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> us treasure up the word in our consciences:</hi> let us get the rule within us, get the articles of faith, and assurance of the promises: and let this bee betimes whiles we are yong: its the ordinarie cry the Scriptures are hard, they cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them. But whats the reason? they are bred up in earthly businesses, and are stuffed with them, so as they finde no place for the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:17807:94"/>
Word, and its a miracle to see men thus brought up, to live by this rule.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>when wee have</hi> once treasured up <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the knowledge of these things, <hi>wee must learne to apply them upon severall occasions:</hi> for where no practice is, there knowledge is idle, and makes us worthy of more stripes, many have generall truthes in their mindes, but comming to apply them, they finde a great want. <hi>David</hi> knew adulterie was a sinne, and <hi>Peter</hi> knew it was dangerous for a man to relye on himselfe, yet how foulely did they fall?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>let us compare our experience with our rule,</hi> wee shall finde there is nothing therein but is fulfilled, that there is no suffering but for some sinne or other, and that besides heaven hereafter, God rewards particular obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience here, with particular rewards, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular sin with particular corrections, we shall know that his judgements are not scarcrowes, <hi>the worke of the wicked is accursed, but it shall goe well with the righteous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and by this meanes we shall bee incouraged to good, and scared from bad courses.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>bee inquisitive and watchfull over <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> our particular steps,</hi> take and heare admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and instructions, and bee inquisitive after them; those that are otherwise minded, no marvaile if they (like libertines) spurne against all instruction and advice, and accordingly feele the smart of their wayes before they see it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:17807:94"/>Fifthly, <hi>get a wonderfull jealousie over our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> hearts:</hi> wee often offend in thoughts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, which God the searcher of the heart lookes into, and we must therefore be jealous of idle thoughts and words, not only of othes, for so an hypocrite may be.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> sanctified with grace and molified, for a stonie hard heart will receive no impression, and to this end are wee to use the meanes, to imbrace the word, to receive the Sacraments, and to pray that God would open our eyes, and sof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten our stonie hearts.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>wee are to looke to everie one that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> hath any good thing worthy of imitation:</hi> as those that delight in gardens, where they heare of any choise flowers, they will have a slip for their owne garden: thus it should bee with us, where we see any flower of any grace, get that and place it in our owne gardens; in every Christian there is something immitable, and something that may further us: and therefore this Apostle longed to see the <hi>Romans,</hi> that hee might be comforted by their faith, 1 <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.

therefore spirituall danger, is the proper object of pitie.

               <p>And let us be farre from <hi>envying such as are in ill courses,</hi> let their outward pompe be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so great, rather lament their miserie: alas poore soules, how are they hurried, nay doe willingly runne to destruction, while they are blinded with those idle shewes of vanitie.</p>

As we would desite to avoid this fearfull estate and condition, so let us take heed of custome of sinning, for that wil make us senselesse, and will move God to give us over.

they shall be damned as enemies for this; that the meanes of salvation they prophane and despise.</p>

Thou canst not live long, neither wilt thou live well therefore while thou livest live for thy pleasure, take thy ease, and from thence inioynes them to use all meanes thereto, take all acquaintance, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine

               <p>As it was then, <hi>so now is it with the Papists their successors:</hi> all the differences in Religion betweene them and us, are by them grounded on the <hi>bellie,</hi> that is the Monarchie of the Pope, and worldly pompe, and Masses inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for idle Priests, latine prayers, little or no preaching, onely that the people being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, they might more easily command them. If their errors were not invested in gaine, wee should soone accord, their worship, especially the manner thereof, onely to delight the sense.</p>
               <p>And among our selves, many are not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that make profession of religion, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the power thereof: so long as religion and outward content doe meet, and when Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on brings preferment, all will be religious, for they live by no rules. but those that their lusts prescribes, morning and evening taking care for the flesh, how to bee rich, how to live at ease, and for this will sell their birthright in happinesse, refusing the Word, refusing good companie, yea heaven it selfe. And this justly comes as a iudgement for mans first rebellion, when men will not serve God as they should, they are iustly given over to the service of those that are no Gods.</p>

               <p>TO <hi>Minde,</hi> in this place is taken largely, to thinke upon, remember, desire, joy, and to have all the soule exercised. <hi>Earthly things,</hi> that is lusts of the flesh, lusts of the eyes, pride of life, pleasures, and profits, and honours: which are therefore called <hi>earthly,</hi> because they are conversant about earthly things, and because they make their followers <hi>earthly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:</hi> and lastly, they are called <hi>earthly,</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to those that are <hi>heavenly</hi>: and thus in particular, those that minde honour are am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious; those that minde riches are covetous, if pleasure then they are voluptuous, and all of them are earthly. For as the Ocean is but one, and yet divers parts thereof have severall names, so worldlinesse is but one sinne, yet having many kindes, it hath also divers names.</p>
               <p>The observation that hence we may gather, is, <hi>that the earthly disposition and minde, is the temper of that man, who is in the estate of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:17807:113"/>
damnation:</hi> for the minde of such doe shew a dead soule, estranged from the life of God: <hi>to be carnally minded is death,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.6. For a man lives as hee mindes and loves.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Observe we further, the Apostle describes not these by any notorious grosse scandalous sinne, but by the inward disposition of the heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for outward actions are onely effects and rivers flowing from the spring of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our hearts.</p>
               <p>Whence we may note, <hi>that God lookes to the inward frame of the soule in men:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though in the eyes of men, a man may be without spot, yet is his corruption that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, open and manifest to the all-seeing eye of God.</p>
               <p>And therefore, <hi>from hence we are to be stirred up, to humble our selves before God, by exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our hearts,</hi> and laying open our most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret corruptions.</p>
               <p>And secondly, <hi>this ought to comfort us,</hi> that though in our dayly practice we often fall, yet God in his goodnesse lookes at the inward frame of the soule, and accepts of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this <hi>justly layes open the folly of mens censures:</hi> if a man breake not out into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen outragious sinnes, they esteeme and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend such for good men, though it may bee

his soule is full stuffed with Atheisme, revenge, and all manner of villanie.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this should teach us to condemne <hi>our selves, even for our sinfull thoughts</hi>: for know, though thou livest without danger of mans law, thou maist have a rebellious minde opposite to the divine law of God, by which thou shalt be judged.</p>
               <p>Yet seeing for this present life, wee stand in need of earthly things, and are not to cast off all care of them, let us hearken to some dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the use of them: For riches and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther necessaries, God sends them unto us to be as meanes to sweeten our pilgrimage here.</p>

               <p>To conclude, <hi>let us so use them, as they be hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of us to a better life, not binderers</hi>: for wee are in an estate betweene two, in a warring and conflicting estate, even as a peece of iron betweene two loadstones, and know not which way to leane, and yet may offend in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of either side.</p>
               <p>And therefore let us observe some signes, whereby we may know whether we bee right or not.</p>
               <p>And first of all,<note place="margin">Signes.</note> this affection of love being the primarie and principall part, is knowne by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> other affections. <hi>If therefore our love bee set on the world, we shall greeve and vexe our selves for worldly losses, and fret and be chafed when wee are crossed in them</hi>: and this made <hi>Ahab</hi> so lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish, as nothing could comfort him but <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths</hi> vineyard.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let us <hi>observe whether our labours <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and indeavours are carried</hi>: what wee talke of most, what thinke we or meditate wee on, first
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:17807:115"/>
and last, morning and evening, if wee observe our carriage, it will discover our minde.</p>
               <p>Such, <hi>are also opposite to any religious good course:</hi> he that is rich, bitterly opposeth good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and therefore it is that Christ said, <hi>Yee cannot serve God, and Mammon,</hi> and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth; It is harder for a rich man to get into heaven, than for a Camell to passe through a needles eye.</p>
               <p>But to cure this sore, <hi>Let us fetch arguments from the nature of the soule of man, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of these things,</hi> and consider the incongrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie betweene the soule, a pure heavenly spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall essence, and base earthly corrupt things, dust was made meate for the serpent by a curse, and not for man.</p>
               <p>And remember, <hi>The God of truth hath threatned vengeance against his dearest children, that doe not mortifie their carnall lusts.</hi> Abhorre we therefore, the first thoughts of this sinne, and divert our soules to higher thoughts, and bee humbled, shaming our selves for debasing our soules in that manner, else will God take us in hand, for he will not suffer his children to surfeit on the world, but will bring them backe, that they shall see and know, <hi>all is but vanitie and vexation of spirit.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Note that in the Church, there are alwayes men of divers dispositions</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some ever goe with the current into <hi>Mare mortuum,</hi> and others ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the streame, like the starres that are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with a secret motion of their owne: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that in this world, they seeme to be carried by the violent motion of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon course of men.</p>
               <p>And this was first, <hi>in Gods eternall decree,</hi> that their should be perpetuall enmitie between the seed of the woman, and of the serpent.</p>
               <p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>There is a difference in calling</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some onely outwardly, some inwardly by his spirit. Many are called, but few are chosen.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>they differ in their rulers</hi>: one are governed by the Divell, and led captive to doe his will, others by God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>in regard of their conversation:</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> some are heavenly minded, others are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther earthly.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>their ends are different</hi>: the way of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> one is upwards to heaven, the way of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is downward, tending to the gates of death, even to hell.</p>
               <p>But to come to the words; The Apostle saith, not <hi>my conversation,</hi> but <hi>our conversation</hi>; implying, that those that meane not to bee of the number of those that have their end in damnation, they must bee of the number of those of a holy conversation. The word in the originall, signifies most properly a freedome, or a Burgership: So as from the metaphour, we may gather thus much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Heaven is a Citie, and all true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are Citizens,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctr.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and inhabitants of this Citie:</hi> for as it is in the Citie of this world, so may it be said comparatively of this Citie and the inhabitants.</p>
               <p>First, its under a governour, who is the Lord Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly, its governed by law, which is Gods law.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it hath a store-house of all good
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:17807:116"/>
things, as of food, and of other of the like sort, which is heaven, for it hath bread of life, it hath rich and plenteous treasure.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it hath liberties, they are free from Sathans tyrannie, free from the lawes curse, and condemning power, and are all Kings, and shall all raigne, they shall bee free from all weaknesse, from ill comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nie, from temptation, the lambe shall be all in all, <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things are spoken of thee thou Citie of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, they speake one language, the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the language of the beast they abhorre.</p>
               <p>And lastly, <hi>their carriage is alike:</hi> grave like Citizens of heaven, their faces are still as they were going to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> their continuing and abiding Citie, for while they are in this life, they are still as it were in the Suburbs.</p>
               <p>Hence, <hi>we may gather divers grounds, that while we live in this world, a Christian is but a Pilgrim and stranger</hi>: heaven is his home, and this life is but a way, and he a passenger. And thus <hi>David</hi> accompt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d of himselfe, though a King, yet but a stranger, both himselfe and his fathers: and therefore, as a passenger, hee provides for his journey, he stands not for ill usage, cares not to looke after delights in the way, but uses them as advantagious to his journey.</p>
               <p>And secondly, <hi>hee is inquisitive after the way</hi>: fearing he should goe amisse, and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth himselfe with cordials, to cheere him and
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:17807:117"/>
strengthen him in his journey, he inquires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the guide of Gods spirit, to be as the pillar of fire to guide him in the darknesse of this world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Hee is well provided of weapons,</hi> against such enemies as hee shall meet with in the way: he hath the shield of faith, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second ground that arises hence, <hi>is that a Christians indeavours are of a high nature</hi>: his looke is high, his soule and minde are ever upward, casting all burthens of earthly cares and delights from him, that hee may freely mount up in the presence of his maker.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, this carriage <hi>of a Christian is not by fits, but it is his trade,</hi> his conversation, and course of life, in all things he lookes to heaven, his course is by rule, and by law: whatsoever he does, he does as in obedience to God chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with all his power, as approving himselfe to God, in whose sight he ever sets himselfe: briefly, hee doth all things as a Citizen of heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, we may also ground hence, that <hi>a Christian may have his conversation in heaven, even while he is here alive:</hi> for hee is borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, having received the life of grace, God requires not impossibilities, but alwayes gives abilitie to the discharge of that which hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quest.</hi>
                  </note>But in particular, how may a Christian bee said to be in heaven, or to have his conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:17807:117"/>I answer,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answ.</hi>
                  </note> a Christian may be said to bee in heaven; first, <hi>as in his head Christ Iesus,</hi> who is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in heaven already, beeing gone to prepare a place for us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>he is there by faith:</hi> which makes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> things absent as present: and so it is that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> saw Christs day, and was glad; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is faith called, <hi>The evidence of things not seene, Heb.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a Christian is in heaven <hi>by his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> hopes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, he is there <hi>by his desires, animus <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> est ubi amat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, a Christian is in heaven, when <hi>as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> his meditations are there</hi>: when his thoughts are thereon continually busied, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was, when in admiration of those joyes he cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out, <hi>O the depth both of the riches and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God! Rom.</hi> 11.33.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, hee is there, when by continuall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> prayers to God, he hath an inward admittance to the throne of grace, where hee may freely open his heart to his God, and therefore it is that those that are Christians indeed, are often in this dutie.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, hence we may gather, that <hi>the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious estate in heaven, is of the same kinde with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> this life of grace, onely differing in degrees of happinesse:</hi> both estates are free; there onely a freedome of glory, here a freedome of grace, both are estates of redemption: there wee are redeemed from sinne, and death, and the divell,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:17807:118"/>
here we are onely redeemed from the power of them; there have we the full harvest, here we have the first fruits, here wee are heires by faith, there by full possession; to all of us Christ is all in all, onely there hee rules im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, here he rules by meanes, by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties. There they have communion with the Saints, here we also have communion, though we live amongst the wicked. There they praise God continually, here we indeavour it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually. There they have communion with the beatificall vision, here wee have communion with the ordinances which will bring us to it.</p>
               <p>And therefore, <hi>let such as intend to be Saints hereafter, be Saints here,</hi> and live by the lawes that are given us from heaven, and that they live by in heaven: for the kingdome is in such sort one and the same, the kingdome of grace, the preaching of the word, is called the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven, as well as the kingdome of glorie; and men doe thinke in vaine ever to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into glorie, without comming in at the gates of grace, as appeareth out of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles argument, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10, 11. <hi>Give diligence to make your calling and election sure, for so an entrance shall be ministred unto you abundantly, into the everlasting kingdome of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Iesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to this end, amongst many other, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve with me these following directions.</p>

                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Dir.</hi>
                  </note>First, for a preparation, <hi>heare the word of God,</hi> for by this wee are in heaven in part already,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:17807:118"/>
for where the word is preached, there is the presence of the blessed Trinitie, and the holy Angels bringing downe heaven it selfe to us, teaching us in the lawes of that Kingdome. <hi>Vse reading also,</hi> for even thereby wee talke with the Saints, who wrote those things for our instruction, and that spirit that guided them in writing, will also guide thee in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Receive the Sacraments often, for these ordinances are the heavenly Manna to us, and and strengthen us in our way, to the spirituall <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Dir.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Rejoyce in often communicating with the Saints:</hi> these earth moles that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in <hi>Coeno,</hi> not in <hi>Coelo,</hi> all companie is alike to them, but a Christian will here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with such, as hee shall be with hereafter, and the Saints have found much helpe this way, even <hi>Saul</hi> in the companie of Prophets, became a Prophet, and the most earthly man that is amongst good men, in good discourse, will sute himselfe to them, and indeed good discourse is of much availe this way, if it bee frequent as it should be. I inforce it not as a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to be done at all times, but it should be oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than it is.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Vse such meanes as are of force to subdue the hinderances of this disposition:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. <hi>Dir.</hi>
                  </note> such as are lusts of youth, which ought to be tamed by fasts, and such watchfulnesse that may make us at the length wise, for so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>acre as wee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our lusts, so farre we have our conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:17807:119"/>
in heaven, and therefore wee must often in private watch, and in private pray; as the Scripture saith, we must watch unto prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4. <hi>Direct.</hi>
                  </note>Fourthly, <hi>Vse much meditation</hi>: bee ever setting our mindes something to this end, that our affections may bee wrought upon, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the world with detestation, and to love and imbrace heaven, and for this dutie wee ought to redeeme some time continually. Thus principally <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God, and <hi>David,</hi> though a King, meditated in Gods law day and night.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">5. <hi>Dir.</hi>
                  </note>And from this dutie, <hi>let us bee brought to a holy use of soliloquies</hi>: checking and shaming our selves for following these pleasures, for unthankfulnesse, and want of cheerefulnesse, as <hi>David why art thou cast down O my soule, why art thou so disquieted?</hi> By these recollections a Christian is indeed himselfe, and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, even seated in heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">6. <hi>Dir.</hi>
                  </note>In the last place besides ejaculations, <hi>use dayly a set prayer</hi>: for thereby wee ascend into heaven, and are fitted thereby to be more and more heavenly, its the trade of Citizens that make them rich, this is our trade, to trade by prayer, with that heavenly Citie, where our treasure is, and by it wee shall grow dayly in riches. Thus is our soule strengthened, and our affections stirred up to converse with God, and thus come wee to set our faith in heaven, together with our love, where our father is, where Angels and Saints, our Citie, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:17807:119"/>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>esires in heaven, to be at rest, to bee with Christ, which is best of all.</p>
               <p>But some will say,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obj.</hi>
                  </note> wee cannot alwayes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend such things as these, we have our callings, and are busied about earthly matters and cares?</p>
               <p>I answer true it is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answ.</hi>
                  </note> yet in the use of these things, wee may bee heavenly minded, for God in mercie appoints us callings, to busie our mindes about, which else would bee del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the idle pleasures of sinne, onely he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, that we in the <hi>first place seeke for heaven,</hi> we shall not continue here, but wee are travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling still, and therefore it is good for us ever to redeeme some time for heaven, that wee may come with more speed to our journeyes end.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as a helpe to us, <hi>hee hath left us his Saboths,</hi> in pitie to our soules, which else would altogether be rooting in the earth: <hi>Let us have a care of the well spending of them:</hi> for by this we pay homage to heaven, and are put in minde thereof.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>everie day redeeme sometime for meditation</hi> of the vanitie of this world, hereby will our untunable soules be still set in tune, and for our callings, every day sanctifie them by prayer, and then all is cleane.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>goe about them as in obedience to
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:17807:120"/>
God,</hi> knowing that God hath placed us in these callings, and he looks for service in imploying those talents bestowed on us, and in our ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one another. And let <hi>us indeavour to shew what our religion is, in avoiding the corruptions of our callings.</hi> Labour also to see God in every thing, <hi>in crossing us,</hi> in <hi>incouraging and assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us,</hi> and this will stirre us up accordingly to pray continually, &amp; in al things to give thanks, and it will make us feare alwayes, for the same care and love of God that brings us to heaven, doth guide us in our particular actions and callings. And in other matters use our selves so, as we by these things raise our mindes on high, for there is a double use of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. First, temporall, and from thence a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall use is raised; thus did Christ, by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering water, he was raised to think of spirituall regeneration and washing: and thus we should doe, labour to see God in his creatures, and thus shall wee helpe our soules by our bodies, God will have it thus; and therefore setteth downe heavenly things in earthly compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">7. <hi>Dir.</hi>
                  </note>Lastly, <hi>wee must indeavour to make a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all use of all things as God doth:</hi> doth God send crosses on us? then before they leave us beg a blessing, that they may worke his intended ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in bettering us. Doth God blesse us with prosperitie? pray that God would sanctifie it to incourage us on to good duties: so as in all estates wee may have our conversation in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:17807:120"/>
Let no man therefore make pretence that he is poore, that he hath no time for this; no, grace workes matter out of every thing, poore <hi>Paul,</hi> nay <hi>Paul</hi> a prisoner, see how he is busied. And the truth is, that worldly prosperitie is the greatest enemie to a heavenly minde that can bee.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>weake Christian will complaine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ob.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>that he cannot finde this in him,</hi> but he is still carried away with worldly matters, though hee strive against it never so much, yet the world goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with him.</p>
               <p>To such I answer,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answ.</hi>
                  </note> strength of grace this way is not in every Christian, neither is it at the first. <hi>Paul</hi> had his destractions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. from 15. to 24. yet must our labours and indeavors be that way: the sinne that is in us cannot hurt us, if we strive against it. God suffers his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to see their weaknesse, as he did deale with <hi>Solomon,</hi> to humble us, and make us learne his lesson, that all is vanitie and vexation of spirit. Let not such therefore bee discouraged, but cheerefully goe on in a good course, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>more we labour and strive, the more wee beautifie Religion,</hi> and credit our Citie, and draw on others to bee fellow Citizens with us.</p>
               <p>And thus shall we free our selves from ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of conscience, and from the snares of the divell, even as birds when they soare aloft need feare no snares. Thus <hi>also shall wee get a portion here, for its the promise of the God of

truth,</hi> that if we first seek the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, al these things shalbe cast upon us. Thus <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so shall wee be sure of Gods gracious and faithfull protection:</hi> who hath said hee will keepe us in our wayes.</p>
               <p>And lastly, thus shall wee end our dayes with comfort, woe bee to him that dies not to the world, before hee goes hence: but to him that hath his soule in heaven, even while it is in his bodie, this life is but a pilgrimage, and death is advantage.</p>

               <head>VERS. 20. From whence wee also looke for the Saviour, the Lord Iesus Christ.</head>
               <p>THese words lay downe such an estate of a Christian, as is both a cause, and a signe, of heavenly conversation, and in them we may consider: First, that Christ is in heaven. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that there is a second comming of Christ. Thirdly, that Christians expect it. Fourthly, that this expectation is a cause of heavenly carriage.</p>
               <p>For the first, <hi>that Christ is in heaven,</hi> wee have the Scripture to warrant it: but the text is pregnant herein, we looke for him from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>ergo,</hi> he is in heaven.</p>
               <p>And therefore its a grosse conceipt of the Papists, that dreame that his bodie is every

                  </gap>ve it: the scripture deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines that the heavens must contain him, that he sitteth now on the right hand of God, that he shall hereafter come to judge, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is not now here; nay because he is not here, he sent us the comforter, the spirit, that shall leade us into all truth, as he himselfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly saith</p>
               <p>Secondly, hence wee may observe, that there is another comming of Christ, which yet is not fulfilled; there is a two-fold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hrist, one whereby he comes in the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sh, this was his first comming: the second comming is in triumph, when he shall perfect our salvation. This appeareth by the desires of the creature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. Secondly, by the faithfull desires of his children, which cannot be in vaine. Thirdly, to this end he tooke our flesh to draw us after him. Fourthly, to this end he left his spirit with us to testifie it. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he hath left us his promises, and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies thereof, witnessed by the Angels, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. <hi>This Iesus shall so come, even as you have seene him goe into heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, that Christians doe expect this comming of Christ, is evident out of the words from whence we looke for the Saviour, saith the Text: the word <hi>looke</hi> signifies an earnest expectation, implying faith, hope, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; faith is a ground of hope, supposing the promises which are grounded on an almightie
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:17807:122"/>
God of truth; now patience comes from hope, so as the word implyes thus much: wee hope, we beleeve, we patiently waite for the second comming of Christ. This is the disposition of every sound Christian, and it begins with the beginning of our new birth: for so (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3.) it is said, we are begotten to a lively hope: and (<hi>Titus</hi> 2.13.) the grace of God once ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, teacheth to looke for the blessed hope.</p>
               <p>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> 2.</note>Secondly, there is such a relation betwixt Christ and us, wee being contracted to him here, as there is a continuall longing for the consummation of this marriage, even as the time betweene the contract and the marriage is a continuall longing.</p>

                     <hi>Reason.</hi> 3.</note>Thirdly, our estate here is a warring and laborious estate, and a painfull service, and therefore what marvaile if a Saboth, a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, victorious, and triumphant estate bee sweet, and to be desired.</p>
               <p>

                        </gap>:</hi>
                  </note>Hence we may learne, that the estate of the children of God here is imperfect, for they are under hope of a better estate; before Christs time, they expected the first comming of Christ: so it is said of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he longed
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:17807:122"/>
to see Christs day. Now after Christs first comming, we looke after his second comming when we shall be perfected; and thus the soules in heaven, are in expectation of a further hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse.</p>
               <p>And this <hi>is the reason of the contrarieties of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> estate that are in a Christian.</hi> Hee rejoyces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is under hope, but he sorrowes because he hath not already obtained the thing he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth for; he rejoyceth because of his assurance, but sorroweth because of the crosses hee dayly meets with; rejoyceth in the communion of Saints, but woe is me that I dwell in <hi>Meshek.</hi> We are Kings, but over rebels; Prophets, but have much ignorance, for we see but in part; Priests, but daily polluted with the soile of this world, and therefore doe stand in need of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall washing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this expectation is not onely a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> worke of ours, but a grace wrought in us by Christ, by vertue of the covenant, for God fits us with graces that have reference to our future happinesse, and it arises from love and patience, grounded upon assurance of an end and glorious issue, Christ knew wee were to meet with enemies, and therefore gives us hope as an helmet and an anchor to keepe us from shipwracke, for hee is a Saviour as well in saving us here from despaire, as hereafter from hell.</p>
               <p>This lastly, may serve for a triall of our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> estates, for many that thinke themselves to be
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:17807:123"/>
good Christians, thinke with <hi>Peter</hi> it is good being here, its good for them to bee in this world, they feare the comming of Christ, the very thought thereof destroyes all their mirth, it is to them like the hand writing on the wall to <hi>Balthasar.</hi> The childe of God is of another disposition, hee is begotten to this hope, his desire is accordingly, his indeavour and labour is by any meanes to attaine to the resurrection of the dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi>
                  </note>But it will bee said, <hi>that its often seene that good Christians doe not alwayes desire the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ.</hi>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi>
                  </note>To which I answer, it is true; but it is caused by their carelesse carriage, and yet ever there is a spirit in them, to indeavour to doe something that may prepare for his comming: but a strong Christian hath ever this desire, and if hee bee a mortified and growing Christian hee never wants this hope, and comfort, and earnest longing, and therefore his prayer ever is; <hi>Come Lord Iesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, we may observe out of the words; where this hope is, and this expectation, it stirres up and quickens the soule to a holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, it is propounded here as a ground of the Apostles holy conversation.</p>
               <p>For <hi>it stirres us up to be pure, even as hee is pure, as it is</hi> (1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.3.) <hi>For wee are a holy Spouse,</hi> and there will shortly come the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age day, and fitting it is that wee prepare our selves fitting for such a husband. Thus it was
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:17807:123"/>
with the concubines of <hi>Akashuerosh,</hi> though a temporall and earthly King, yet the custome was, they should bee twelve monthes before they came to the King: and much more should it be our dutie, ever more to bee prepared to come into the presence of our eternall heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly King to meet with the bridegroome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we know not how soone it may be, that he will come and send his Angels for us, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before him in glory, to call us to the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this <hi>hope will stirre us up to doe all good duties, and to right performance of good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to doe all things sincerely, as in the presence of God our judge:</hi> And therfore not only the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of preaching is urged upon <hi>Timothy,</hi> but the manner, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. Who is charged by the Lord Iesus Christ, who shall judge all at his appearing, that he should <hi>preach the Word, bee instant in season, out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long sufferance.</hi> And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Peter</hi> having declared the second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ, thence inferres; <hi>what manner of men ought wee to be in all godly conversation?</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.11.) And indeed, meditation of the principles of Religion, will informe us well in the manner of our duties, as in the nature of them, and thus shall we be fruitfull in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, according as our meditations are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed though the principle matters and objects of our meditation are but few.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>this hope and expectation will stirre
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:17807:124"/>
us up to pray for the consummation and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to passe the performance of all those promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses which are to be performed before the comming of Christ:</hi> as that the Gospell should bee prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in all places, that the conversion of the Iewes might be hastened, and the downefall of Antichrist might speedily come to passe. And this hope will also incourage us and put us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that in our severall callings and stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, we should helpe on the performance of them, as much as is in our power to performe, by helping on the building of the Church, and the inlargement of Christs kingdome, and the confusion of his enemies.</p>
               <p>Lastly, <hi>this hope will worke in us a sweet and comfortable carriage in all estates and conditions, carrying us through all impediments with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</hi> For yet a little while, and hee that shall come will come, and will not tarrie, and hee will come full handed. <hi>My reward is with me,</hi> (saith Christ) and lest we should thinke it long before he comes, hee told us long agoe, that those were the latter dayes, and that the ends of the world were then come upon them. Doe <hi>men then molest us, persecute and vexe us? let us be comforted,</hi> hee comes that will tread all our enemies under our feet. Do <hi>we find that we have but short spirits, that our graces are but weake? let us not dishearten our selves, hee that keepes heaven for us, will give us necessarie graces to bring us thither:</hi> if we want, goe to the God of faith and love, hee hath promised to give
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:17807:124"/>
us his spirit, to make all grace abound in us, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to leave us nor forsake us, till he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected his worke, in setting us with him in glorie.</p>
               <p>But to proceed to the object of this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, it is Christ who is described unto us by the Saviour, whom hee calles also Iesus, which signifies a Saviour: and this he doth, to impresse it the deeper into his affections.</p>
               <p>But some may say,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quest.</hi>
                  </note> Christ hath saved us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, what need is there therefore of his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond comming?</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi>
                  </note> it is to perfect our salvation: for redemption of our bodies, and glorious liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie are reserved to his second comming, wee looke not that he should die any more, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare as a Lord of glorie in glorie, without hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation for sinne, having already gotten vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie of it.</p>
               <p>The observation is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>that Christ is a Saviour, and the Saviour by way of excellencie:</hi> he saves all that are of his mysticall body, from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and preserves them to all good, hee saves their bodies and their soules now from the power of all evill, and hereafter hee will free them from all evill, he is the everlasting Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, while we live here his bloud runnes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, this is the fountaine opened for the house of <hi>Iudah,</hi> for sinne and uncleannesse, in it are we cleansed from the guilt and damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinne, what would wee have more? <hi>Wee are kept by faith to salvation,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Let
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:17807:125"/>
this raise up our soules</hi> Are wee swallowed up with the sense of any miserie? Let us know that we trust a Saviour that is every way ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, that invites those that are sicke with sinne, to come unto him: and <hi>how can wee escape, if wee neglect so great salvation.

               <p>Lastly, this should comfort us when wee thinke of the last day, to thinke withall, that he shall be our judge that is our Saviour, and therefore should cast away all terrour from us, knowing that our head will not destroy his members, but that hee our husband being a great King, will also crowne us his spouse with a glorious crowne, therefore when wee see the fore-going signes come to passe, let us lift up our heads, knowing our redemption draweth neere.</p>
               <p>To goe on in the next place, Christ is not only our <hi>Saviour, but he is our Lord:</hi> wherein we may see the Apostles Christian wisedome, hee useth such titles as may most of all strengthen his faith and affection of the present meditation, which being a point of the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, a thing seeming contrarie to reason, to flesh and bloud: hee strengthens himselfe in this consideration, that <hi>he is the Lord,</hi> who ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:17807:125"/>Secondly, <hi>he is Lord by title of redemption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> so as we are no more our owne but his, for he hath bought us with a price.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>he is Lord of the world, and of the divell by conquest, Heb.</hi> 2.14.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, hee is Lord over his Church by marriage, hee is our husband, governing his Church with sweetnesse and love.</p>
               <p>He is also <hi>the Lord</hi> by way of excellencie above others, <hi>depending on no creature,</hi> hee is Lord of Lords.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he is Lord of body and soule, and conscience, punishing with terrors here, and damnation hereafter.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>he is Lord eternall,</hi> hee indures for ever and cannot die.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he is such a Lord, as cannot abuse his authority, he cannot tyrannize, his grace and vertue, are of equall extent with his power.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>he is a holy Lord,</hi> holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabboth, that is Lord of hosts.</p>
               <p>In all these, hee is farre above any earthly man, yea above all creatures. And therefore, its a sweet estate, to bee under government and rule. <hi>They then that are Lords here on earth, must consider though they rule and are above others, yet are they under the Lord:</hi> thus did <hi>Ioseph.</hi> Therefore <hi>they must rule, but in the Lord,</hi> it is his will, that must rule their wils.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>this should comfort Christians:</hi> that they have such a Lord, as is Lord of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, at whom the divells tremble: whom
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:17807:126"/>
stormes, windes, seas, sicknesse, death, and all creatures doe obey. Yet wee cannot challenge this comfort, but upon condition of our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: the Apostle joynes Lord and Saviour together, to shew that he is a Saviour onely to those that take him for their Lord, to governe and rule them; as he is our Priest, he must also be our King, he comes by water to purge and wash us, as well as by bloud to suffer for us. The wicked they will not have this man rule over them, but they shall not say nay, God wil be a Lord over them, ruling by his power, with a rod of iron hee will bruise them in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, none shall deliver them. If we will avoid this miserable estate, let us make him Lord in us: thus shall we crowne him, and then he will crowne us with himselfe.</p>

               <p>And first, we may observe hence <hi>That our bodies are base:</hi> and thus are the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies not onely of wicked prophane men,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctr.</hi> 1.</note> but of the servants and dearest children of God, all are vile, and that in these respects.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:17807:126"/>First, in life our <hi>originall is base, wee are dust,</hi> and to dust wee must returne, and our conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance is full of change, subject to diversitie of estates, sicknesse, health, paine, ease, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, fulnesse. And base wee are, because wee are upheld by inferiour creatures. We enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world by one way, but goe out by divers deaths, some violent, some more naturall, and by divers sicknesses lothsome to the eyes, to the nosthrils, and especially when wee are nearest our end, when as our countenance is pale, our members tremble, all our beautie is gone. But <hi>after wee are departed, so lothsome is this our carcasse, it must bee had out of sight:</hi> yea though it bee the body of the Patriarch <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 23.4. For as the bodie of man is the best temper, so the corruption there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is the most vile, the best countenances of the greatest personages are the most ugly gastly objects of all others, by so much the more, by how much they were the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, so much the greater is their change. <hi>And yet are wee not to conceive of this bodie, so as though there were no glorie belonging to it: for first, its Gods workmanship, therefore excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,</hi> and so excellent, as the heathen man <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> being stricken into admiration at the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable frame thereof, breakes out into a hymne in praise of the maker. And <hi>David</hi> could not expresse it, but sayes, <hi>I am wonderfully made.</hi> God made this his last worke, as an Epitomie of all the rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:17807:127"/>Secondly, <hi>we are told that we owe glorie to our bodies</hi>: and therefore we are bidden that wee should not wrong our bodies, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture speakes infamously of selfe-murtherers, as of <hi>Iudas, Saul, Achitophel,</hi> they are branded with a note of shame and reproach. And God to shew the respect we owe to our bodies, hath provided to every sense pleasing recreations, as flowers for the smell, light for the eyes, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke for the eare, to be briefe, hee made all things for the bodily use of man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>these bodies of ours are members of Christ,</hi> redeemed and sanctified Temples of the holy Ghost, as well as our soules: And therefore we must take heed when wee read of the base termes that are given to the bodie, that we doe not mistake. For it is true, in regard it keepes the soule from heaven, it is the grave of the soule, but indeed it is the house, the temple and instrument of the soule, but being misused it proves an unto ward darke house, an unweldie instrument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wee are to take heed therefore, of the error of those who afflict it by writing and declaiming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it,</hi> or by whipping of it, when alasse it is the sinne of the soule, the unruly lusts and affections that are the causes of all rebellions in us, and if the body doth rebell, as often it doth come to passe since the fall, this proceeds from the corruption of the soule, yeelding to the bodie ayde to serve the lusts, and God hath appointed a religious abstinence as a
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:17807:127"/>
meanes to tame such lusts and weaken them, which it were to be wished were used oftener than it is.</p>

               <p>I answer, while we live here we are in no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condition than others,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answ.</hi>
                  </note> as concerning our bodies. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> is sicke, <hi>Lazarus</hi> hath his sores, <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Iob</hi> troubled with lothsome diseases, and thus its fitting it should fare with us.</p>
               <p>For first, <hi>Christ laid us this example, he tooke our base ragged nature on him,</hi> hee hungred and thirsted, was pained, and death had a little pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over him, and shall we desire a better estate than our master, our head had? or doe we ever thinke to partake with him in happinesse, that will not partake with him in his mean estate? the decree of God is, that to dust wee must, as all the rest of our fellow Saints and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants shall.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>hereby God doth exercise our faith and hope</hi>: causing us to looke and expect a better resurrection, and by this meanes are our desires edged to a better life, for else would we set up our rest here, and make this our Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as yet there is sinne in us, from the danger whereof though wee be deliuered, <hi>yet there is a corruption that remaineth behinde in us,</hi> and by this hee will teach us the contagion
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:17807:128"/>
of sinne, and teach us to see how the divell hath deceived us, by the effects thereof bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paine, torment, and lothsomnesse.</p>
               <p>Forthly, <hi>it shewes Gods wisedome</hi> in van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishing sinne by death, which is the childe of sinne, for by it shall we be purged from sinne, from corruption both of bodie and minde, and thus is our base estate made a way to our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent estate hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wee must therefore moderate our affections to the best things of this life:</hi> health is change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and will not continue, beautie is a flower of a stalke, the flower quickly fades away and perisheth, the stalke that is more base continues longest, flesh is grasse either cut downe by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent deart, or if by age, the longer it lives the baser it is, and increases continually therein till death, when as it is most base.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is therefore foolish for any to swell because of beautie or strength,</hi> which at the best, are but curious excellencies of a base bodie: and farre more sottish are they, that thinke to resist old age and Gods decree, by trimming up and painting a withered stocke, this is not the way to conquer vilenesse. <hi>But if we will be rid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, labour for the meat that perisheth not, Ioh.</hi> 6.27. But that which maketh us indure to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life, is with <hi>Marie</hi> to chuse the better part, that shall not be taken away: meat for the belly, and the belly for meate, but God shall destroy both the one and the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And let this be as a cooler, to quench the base
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:17807:128"/>
wild-fire of love,</hi> and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ider what is it wee so affect, its but beautifull dust, a painted sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, a body that after death will bee vilenesse it selfe, that while it breathes its full of rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, the matter of wormes, supported it may be, by a carrion soule, that whether it willeth or nilleth, must leave it and goe into a farre worse place.</p>
               <p>And contrarily, in the last place, <hi>it should teach us to be at a point, cheerefully to honour God by sacrificing our selves to him when hee calles for us</hi>: count it no shame with <hi>David</hi> to be vile in the eyes of men for Gods cause, if the worst could be imagined (which cannot be) we had as good perish with usage aswith rust. But this is the onely way to be glorious, to avoid vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, even to sacrifice our bodies and all in a good cause: what though the world esteem vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of us, as good for nothing but the shambles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.36. shall wee feare them? no, feare him that can destroy both body and soule: its better to goe to heaven without a limbe, than to goe to hell with a sound healthfull bodie, therefore men temptation of the world doe begin to provoke thee, say to thy flesh with <hi>Bernard,</hi> stay thy time: (the time is not yet to be happie.)</p>
               <p>And therefore conclude, <hi>our soule is but a stranger here, wee must entertaine it well into this house of our bodie</hi>: its but a guest, use it not basely, its no ill guest, it gives us sight, taste, speech, motion, when it goes away, our body

is but a dumbe, dull, base lumpe of earth. Nay, when it is gone whilst the body is in the ground the soule having a most vehement and earnest desire to be knit to it again, puts God continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in minde of raising it up at the last day of the generall resurrection, and of glorifying it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in a holy, eternall, and happy estate.</p>
               <p>Secondly, out of the words wee may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve; <hi>That these vile bodies of ours shall bee changed</hi>: this we receive as anarticle of our faith, and yet were it beleeved truely as it ought, it would worke a strange alteration in the mindes and manners of men, contrary to that they are now, and howsoever it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, yet it remaines a grounded truth, that these bodies of ours sowne in corruption, shall rise incorruptible, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.15. It was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told in way of consequence in Paradice, for the head of the serpent could not bee broken but by conquering death, which is the last enemie: it was figured out unto us in <hi>Aarons</hi> dead seare rod that budded, and <hi>Ionahs</hi> deliverance out of the bellie of the fish, where he had beene 3. dayes and three nights. <hi>It was beleeved of all the fathers, Heb.</hi> 12. And for securitie before the floud <hi>Enoch,</hi> and after the floud <hi>Elias,</hi> were taken up in their bodies.</p>
               <p>And besides, it is not contrarie to reason, (I doe not say that reason can reach unto it) for Christ he is alive still, the dust whereof we are made, and whether we goe is preserved, it is not annihilated, and why cannot Christ raise
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:17807:131"/>
a body out of the dust, as at the first make it out of dust? why should he not be as able to quicken dust now as at the first? and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, seeing the soule is reserved in heaven to this end, till the day of his second comming.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nay it is not contrarie to the course of nature:</hi> we see every yeere summer comes out of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, day out of night, youth out of infancie, mans age out of youth: And the Apostle in the <hi>Corinthians, Thou foole, the corne is not quickned, except it die:</hi> nay wee see what strange changes are dayly wrought by Art, and shall wee thinke Gods almighty power cannot worke farre more strange effects?</p>
               <p>The use therefore,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi>
                  </note> is to instruct us if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that Christ shall change these vile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, <hi>Then sure the same bodies shall rise that died, for change is of qualities, it abolisheth not substances</hi>: and therfore <hi>Iobs</hi> confidence here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is remarkable, <hi>Iob.</hi> 19. <hi>Whom I shall see for my selfe, and mine eyes shall behold,</hi> speaking of Christ, so is it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.53. <hi>This corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble must put on incorruption, and this mortall must put on immortalitie,</hi> and the ancient Creeds had, <hi>credore surrectionem carnis hujus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>its very unequall that one body should honour or defile it selfe, and another bodie should be honoured or damned:</hi> its comfortable therefore to us that love our bodies and honor them, that they shall rise againe, and wee shall injoy them for ever.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Christ our surety hee raised the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:17807:132"/>
same body that was crucified, and therefore the same bodies here that fulfill the measure of the sufferings of Christ here, shall partake of his fulnesse in glorie.</p>
               <p>A second use is for comfort; is this a life of changes, let it not daunt us, but know they are all to end in glorie, and they all tend to bring us thither, we ever change for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the last change of all is the best of all, and therefore let us indure these changes with a light heart.</p>
               <p>In the third place, who is the Authour of this change in us, the Text saith that <hi>Christ shall change us, Iob.</hi> 6.39. <hi>and</hi> 40. <hi>I will raise them up at the last day, saith Christ</hi> of those that know him and beleeve on him: <hi>Hee is further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more our head,</hi> now wee know the body must be conformable to the head, if it bee crowned the body is crowned: and therefore (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11.) the Apostle saith, that if the spirit dwell in us that did dwell in him, the spirit that raised him up, will raise us up also.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Christ is a whole Saviour,</hi> he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will raise up our bodies as well our soules, for he is the Saviour of both, he hath delivered both from hell, hee will raise up both to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>he is the second Adam,</hi> as wee did beare the image of the first <hi>Adam</hi> in corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so must we beare the image of the second <hi>Adam</hi> in glorie.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>hee is the seed of the wowan:</hi> that
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:17807:132"/>
must breake the serpents head, and therefore hee must worke this change.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Christ changed his owne bodie,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burthened with all our sinnes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as an exemplarie cause, shall much more raise us up, for sinne being once overcome, which is the sting of death, what can keepe us in the grave?</p>
               <p>Let <hi>this strengthen our faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 1.</note> in the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that wee have such a strong Saviour, that nothing shall bee able to separate us from his love, nor to take us out of his hande.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>make it a ground how to direct us how to honour our bodies,</hi> not making them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of sinne against him, but so to use them, that we may with comfort and joy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and desire his comming, to change these our vile bodies.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 3.</note> let us labour to assure our selves of our parts in this change, in this resurrection. This we shall know if we <hi>finde Christs spirit in us,</hi> the same spirit that raised up him, if it bee in us, will raise us up also. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. for the first resurrection is an argument of the second, and he that findes his understanding in lightned, his will pliable, his affections set upon right objects, will easily beleeve the second resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of his bodie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if wee hope for this change, and so hope that we are stirred up thereby to fit our selves for it, to cleanse our selves.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if wee grow in grace, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11.
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:17807:133"/>
it is a si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne that wee have an entrance into Christs kingdome, for God doth ever honour growth, with assurance of a blessed estate.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>this should comfort us in time of death,</hi> considering wee lose nothing but base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and our bodies are but sowne in the earth, and this <hi>depositum</hi> which God committeth to the fire, ayre, earth, and the water, they must render up againe pure and changed by Christ, and therefore it was a foolish conceipt of the heathen, to burne the Martyrs bodies, and to cast their ashes into the water, thereby to put them out of hope of their resurrection, not knowing God is as able to raise them out of fire and water, as out of earth.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, this ought to administer comfort to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> us at the death and departure of our friends out of this life, knowing that they are not lost, that the earth is but a house, and a hiding place for them to sleepe in, and that at length God will not forget to raise them up, with the residue of his Saints, hee will change them, and make them like his glorious bodie, and this was the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> use made by the Apostle, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.18.</p>
               <p>And lastly, <hi>pray to God to teach us to number our dayes,</hi> so as we may apply our hearts to wisedome. But when is the time of this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed change? It is not laid downe, onely it is implyed by the word (<hi>Shall</hi>) that the time is to come, but out of all question it is meant at the last day and not before.</p>
               <p>First, because all are to bee gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:17807:133"/>
even those that were baried 4000. yeers agone, must stay till the number bee fulfilled, and it will make for Gods glorie that we should all meet together to attend on him, with mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Angels, so as they cannot be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without or before us, and wee shall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent those that are asleepe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it <hi>is for the comfort of Christians that are weake,</hi> that the Martyrs and constant professors of Christ, should be pledges of their rising, who continually cry, <hi>how long Lord?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>God wils that things should now bee carried as in a cloud:</hi> and that the last day should bee a day of revelation, which could not be,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi>
                  </note> if before there should be this change.</p>
               <p>For use, this must teach us to <hi>desire that day, and pray for the hastening thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> till when, the soules in heaven are not perfectly happy, for all must be brought in, before they can be made perfect: and therefore they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and hope for, and pray for to be united to those bodies again, that they lived withall, and so deerely loved.</p>
               <p>But who are these that shall be thus changed? The Text saith, <hi>our bodies,</hi> that is our bodies <hi>that have had our conversation in heaven:</hi> and therefore those that have had no part in the first resurrection, they shall have no p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I answer, in these particulars:</p>

               <p>Secondly, we shall be uncorruptible, wee shall have no corruption whithin us or without us; as it is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.53. We shall be embal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the spirit, that shall cause us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine for ever incorruptible.</p>

               <p>Fifthly, we shall have <hi>beautie and comelinesse,</hi> the most lovely complexion and proportion of parts, there shall be no dregges in our body, all shall be spent by death, farre better than after Physicke, which notwithstanding brings the body into a quiet repose, all wants shall be supplyed, what is misplaced shall be reduced into right order: and therefore, what though we lose limbes for Christs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>VERS. 21. According to the working, whereby he is able even to subdue all things to Himselfe.</head>
               <p>THe word that is translated <hi>working,</hi> may and doth signifie power, and so it was translated heretofore, and is to be meant. But the words being plaine, we will come to some observations.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctrine.</hi> 1.</note>And first of all observe, <hi>That Christ hath a power able to subdue all things to himselfe:</hi> and this hee hath by vertue of his office of Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torship, and this in respect of God to reconcile and appease him. Secondly, in respect of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite powers to overcome all of them. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in respect of the persons to be saved, that he might free them from all ill, and raise them to all happinesse, and these things requires a power, that must be above all created powers, for God could not bee appeased but by an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite price, the bloud of one that is God: and wee could not bee defended from sinne and hell (whose power is the greatest of all finite power) but by a power beyond it, and such a
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:17807:136"/>
power as must regenerate and renew us not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the opposite power of the divell, and our corruptions within us, which is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter worke than the worke of our creation. And all this he hath done, <hi>he hath subdued him that had the power of death, the Divell. Heb.</hi> 2.14. He hath subdued diseases and windes with a word, and with a word he smote his enemies to the ground, he hath subdued all ill of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and minde, forgiving sinnes, opening our hearts, subduing our corruptions, and death hath yeelded to his power. <hi>O death, I will bee thy death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place, as Christ hath this <hi>power,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> so he will use this power for the good of his Saints.</hi> and this hee will doe, because <hi>what ever Christ is, he is for the good of his Church,</hi> hee is power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, merciful and loving, for his Churches sake.</p>
               <p>And secondly, <hi>because our bodies doe require it:</hi> for it must be an infinite power that makes the body of dust: and therefore though Christ was the sonne of God, declared from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yet it was said hee was mightily declared to be the son of God by his resurrection from the dead, for from a privation to a habit, there can be no regression by a naturall course, and therefore for our bodies to returne from dust, must be by a supernaturall infinite power of one that is God. <hi>Let those that are enemies to Christ his members consider this,</hi> against whom doe ye strive? even against the Almighty, who in his humiliation, was able with a word to
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:17807:137"/>
strike his enemies to the ground, and now being in glory, how fearfull and terrible should his power be to such? who should learn betimes to kisse the sonne, before they perish in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. And for his children, <hi>let them comfort themselves that are under the government</hi> of so powerfull a majesty, for he will bruise all their enemies under them. Nay they are already all conquered, and let them consider of all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and apply them to his power. It is a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull Saviour that said, <hi>Come to me all you that are heavie laden, I will raise you up,</hi> it is he that is able to subdue all things to himselfe, that promises my grace shalbe sufficient for you, he is a Prophet to instruct fully, a Priest to satisfie Gods wrath to the utmost, a King to subdue all their corruptions.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>let this incourage us to set our selves against our corruptions:</hi> some there are that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a little strove with their lusts, and finding not that they have gotten any sensible ground against them, they as out of hope and heart, sit down with this opinion, <hi>as good never a whit as not the better</hi>; and so yeeld up the bucklers: what a distrustfull incredulous estate is this? is not he God that hath promised? is hee not truth it selfe? hath he said, and shall it not come to passe? feare not these <hi>Anakims</hi> nor <hi>Cananites,</hi> depend on God in the use of the meanes, and let him alone with the performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his promises.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>despaire of none though never so weake,</hi> so long as they use the meanes, for
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:17807:137"/>
Christ hath created all by his word, hee will raise us up by his word, and will change us by his word, and by this word he is able to change others, though never so obstinate; for so long as they are under the word and meanes, they are under the armes of an almighty power, and therefore if any be in our power, or if wee wish well to any, we should perswade them to prize the word, and to use the meanes.</p>
               <p>In the next place, <hi>this is a ground of triall of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> our estates:</hi> would we know whether we are of the number of those that shall bee raised up hereafter and changed, then examine whether <hi>we have found this power changing us, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to grace here,</hi> for <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19, 20. the same power worketh in us to beleeve, that raised up Christ, doe wee then finde our understandings inlightned, our wils conformable to his wil? do we finde the strong holds of sin in us rased, and new spirits, new thoughts, new desires in us? O these are blessed evidences of Christs almighty power in us, that will raise us up at the last day.</p>
               <p>By <hi>this meanes also wee may try our profession:</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> doe we come by faith and religion, with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and ease? alas this is no signe of any power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full strong worke in us, its easie to goe to Church, to heare the word, or reade it, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the sacraments, contrarily if we finde an inward change that our hearts are so altered as we can over <hi>rule our members contrary to our lusts,</hi> and contrary to occasions, then stronger is he that ruleth in us, than hee that ruleth in
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:17807:138"/>
the world, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.4. it is easie to resist a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation where none is, the mightie power of Christ is seene, when being invironed with temptations, we are inabled to resist: I pray saith Christ, that thou should keepe them from evill in the world, and not that thou shouldst take them out of the world, <hi>Ioh,</hi> 17.15. If we be under crosses, if this spirit and power of Christ be in us, it will enable us to beare all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, it will keepe us from murmuring and fretting. <hi>It will also convince us of our naturall estate,</hi> so as wee shall see evident necessitie of Gods almighty power to change us; this made the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> and the Iaylor to looke about them for helpe, Lord what wouldest thou have me to doe? and thus it <hi>will make us never to give God rest, nor Christ respite,</hi> till that power that shall raise up our bodies, doe raise up al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so our soules, and he shine in us by his spirit, that did bring light out of darknes, and fashion us as in his wisedome shall be most meet.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> In the next place, the consideration of Gods Almightie power, should <hi>teach us not to be dejected or cast downe, at the reports of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted state of the Church abroad,</hi> it should bring us rather to God, to rely upon his goodnes and power, for God is ever God almighty, and the same mercifull God that ever he was, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we should pray for the Church the more instantly, that God would give them beautie instead of ashes, wee should urge him with his promise of building up and defending of his
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:17807:138"/>
Church, and destroying of Antichrist, and let us make the resurrection of the body a ground to strengthen us in the beleefe thereof, as the returne of the children of Israel from <hi>Babylon,</hi> was sealed by the resurrection of the dry bones, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. as also the Apostle from the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead, gathereth that God by that power, hath and will deliver him. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9, 10.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, <hi>when wee are oppressed with any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> extremitie, though never so great, by continuall meditation of his promises, wee should strengthen our selves, and apply them to our present estate and condition,</hi> knowing that he that raised us out of dust, will not suffer us to bee buried in miserie, but will with the triall give us a gracious issue at the last, by raising up our bodies at the last day by his almighty power, which made also the Patriarch <hi>Abraham</hi> to hope above hope: what though our helpes be few? its no matter what the instrument is, so as Christ is the chief worker.</p>
               <p>In the next place, <hi>This should incourage us, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> stand out sted fast in a good cause for the truth</hi>; do not think with our selves, alas I am but one, and a weake sillie man; what can I doe against a multitude? let not such thoughts discourage thee: thinke of <hi>Luther</hi> a poore Monke, who alone set himselfe against the whole world, and wrought that effect, that wee have all cause at this day to honour the memorie of him: it is not thou, but God in thee, that is able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found all thine enemies, and therefore with
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:17807:139"/>
                  <hi>Moses,</hi> behold him that is invisible.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Yet further, <hi>this should bee observed by a Christian, as a ground of his perseverance to the end:</hi> for when wee know we are Christians, what can bereave us of our blessings? what can make our faith faile? its Gods power that will keepe us to salvation, and he that beleeveth shall have life, and shall not come into condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.39, 40.44.47. and many other places; and Christ by his almighty power swayes all our life, to our building up to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore in contraries we should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve contraries, that death will worke life, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie happinesse, corruption incorruption, and this vilenesse glorie; for its Gods order to worke by contraries, that his power might the more appeare.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> And <hi>at the houre of death then behold him that is thus able and all-sufficient</hi>; that shall present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glorifie our soule, and at length will raise up our bodie also, and unite it to our soule, to partake with it in glorie and happinesse, that will then quit us of all sinne, corruption, death, change, all our enemies shall bee troden under our foote, and all this by his almightie power, whereby he is able to doe farre above that wee are able to think; and therefore let us with a holy admiration thereof, say with the Apostle, (<hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.20.) To him be glorie for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>
