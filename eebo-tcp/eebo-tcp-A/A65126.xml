            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THIS Novel throws it ſelf at your Feet, and pays you Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage as its Maſter's Repreſentative:</p>
            <p>It has been the product of ſome leiſure hours, and will I hope do me this ſecond kindneſs, to divert you in the Reading, as it did me in the Making. I need not, as others, give any reaſon for the Dedication; ſince to be made by me, is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to entitle it yours:</p>
            <p>But that is not the only claim it can lay to your Favour; for in deſcribing the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:44408:3"/>
of this Novel, I borrow from you, not only her Name, but ſome of the chief Beauties I adorn her with:</p>
            <p>Though you may imagine ſhe had no mean ones of her own, ſince (being but a private Gentlewoman) ſhe could by their help alone make ſo ſudden a Conqueſt over the Heart of a Prince, who had certainly (in ſo many Courts as he had been in) ſeen very agreeable Faces, ſet off with the additional Splendor of Quality, yet none of them had that effect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, which hers gained without thoſe advantages. Beſides, her true Character ſuits very well with you:</p>
            <p>She was an Innocent Country Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, ignorant of the Intrigues and Tricks of the Court Ladies; her Vertue, like yours, untainted and undecayed, needed none of their Artificial Embelliſhments to guild it over; and that Innocence which appears eminently in both of you, as little wants theſe Ladies Artifices to ſet it off, as you do their <hi>Fucus</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:44408:3"/>
for your Faces; ſince true Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence is as far beyond Diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as your Colour is beyond all the Paint of the Town; in both of theſe you give Nature as ſignal a Triumph over Art, as ever ſhe had in any two things whatſoever. I wiſh I could liken you to her in one thing more; that is, That your Servant were of as high Quality as hers; but this wiſh is made meerly for your ſake:</p>
            <p>For to me, as you are more precious than a Crown, ſo is the Title of a Prince inferiour to that Glorious one, of being the</p>

            <head>The PREFACE TO THE Ill-Natur'd READER.</head>
            <p>THe Dutcheſs of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining once at her Table the Bloody <hi>Bonner,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> ſate firſt by the Duke her Husband, but the Duke removing her thence, ſhe went and ſate by the Biſhop, ſaying, That ſince ſhe could not ſit by him ſhe loved beſt, ſhe would next him ſhe loved worſt:</p>
            <p>So dear dogged Reader, from writing an Epiſtle to her I love beſt, like the Dutcheſs, I change and remove to you whom I love worſt: for Writers hate none ſo much as Ill-natured Readers:</p>
            <p>Perhaps you'll ask, why then this Epiſtle to you whom I hate, and not rather to the Good-natured? Why for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the Dutcheſs ſate by <hi>Bonner,</hi> meerly to paſs my Jeſt on you; though another may be given, which is, That ſince Prefaces were partly deſigned to make the Reader Indulgent and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
<pb facs="tcp:44408:4"/>
to the Book he is going to read, there's no need of a Preface to others, ſince the Good-Natured will be kind to it of themſelves; but 'tis you, that put us to the trouble of Prefacing. Therefore to indear it the more to you know, that the main Story is true, I heard of a Gentleman who was acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Princeſs, and knew all the Intrigue, and having from him ſo faithful a Relation of it, I made the Scene the very ſame where it was tranſacted, the time the ſame, going on all the way with the Truth, as far as conveniency would permit; I only added ſome few Circumſtances, and interlined it with two or three other Stories, for variety ſake, which is as neceſſary to the ſetting off the true Relation, and making it pleaſant, eſpecially to you nice Readers, as Sauces are to the dreſſing up a Diſh of Meat, to provoke the ſickly Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite it is deſign'd for. I Printed it for the eaſe of her whom it was made for; if you like it, much good
<pb facs="tcp:44408:5"/>
may do you; if you will not believe it, you have Liberty of Conſcience; but whether you believe, or disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, like, or diſlike, is indifferent to me, ſince in ſuch a trivial thing as this, I no more fear diſcredit by writing a bad one, than I could hope for Fame in writing it well. But I believe you are eager to ſee what is in the Book, and therefore I'll detain you no longer.</p>

               <p>AS that mighty River which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflows <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and, with its prevailing Torrent, often drowns thoſe Provinces, which Nature only deſign'd it to water, yet proceeds at firſt from ſuch mean begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, that moſt Geographers have been unable to trace it to its Spring:</p>
               <p>So Loves ſwifter and more violent Stream has its firſt riſe from ſuch ſmall Channels, ſuch trifling circumſtances, that the Heart it ſelf can ſcarce perceive its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal; nay very often does not diſcern its progreſs, till it is too ſtrong for it, and ſo the ſudden vigour of its Torrent ſurprizes the unwary Lover, juſt as the <hi>Zudder</hi> Sea, driven with a North-weſt Wind, breaks the Diques, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelms the drowzy <hi>Hollander,</hi> before he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44408:6"/>
ſuſpects any danger. Yet ſo Natural is Self-conceit, and ſo Univerſal our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to Knowledge, that few there are who will be ſo Modeſt, as to own them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wholly Ignorant of any thing which you ſhall ask them a Reaſon for. Hence it is, that, among other things, Love too is underſtood by all, and not one but will give his Verdict of it as ſoon as you ask him:</p>
               <p>The States-man will tell you it is cauſed by want of Ambition; the Merchant for want of Self-Intereſt; the Souldier for want of Action, and a thirſt after Honour; and the Scholar will prove to you, that 'tis gotten by Idleneſs:</p>
               <p>But it is with this, as with the Philoſophers Stone, whoſe myſterious Nature all gueſs at, and none know what it is, for it very often breaks all the Rules that are preſcribed againſt it:</p>
               <p>Sets upon the States-man at Court, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes his Ambition; ſeizes on the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant in his Counting-Houſe, and weighs down his Intereſt; finds the Scholar in his Study, and teaches him a new Syſtem of Philoſophy which baffles all the old; wounds the daring Souldier, even when he is clad in Steel, and makes him tamely ſubmit to Captivity, in the very midſt of his Conqueſts:</p>
               <p>The Story that I am going
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44408:6"/>
to relate will be an excellent proof of this, being an Inſtance of an extraordinary ſort:</p>
               <p>It makes Love triumphant at once over two of theſe his greateſt Enemies, the Noiſe of War, and the Vanity of Ambition; and ſhows you a Prince of great Valour, guarded equally by both of theſe, could not defend himſelf from the Powerful Eyes of a Forreigner, and one as far beneath him in Quality, as Love afterwards placed her above him, when he lay at her Feet imploring her Mercy. When our preſent King had fought the Battel at the <hi>Boyn,</hi> and drove the Routed Enemy into <hi>Limerick,</hi> he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to root up the War, by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing that obſtinate City, that durſt hold out alone againſt the force of three Kingdoms, united in a Royal Army; he had then amongſt his Forreign Troops ſeveral petty Princes, who fought under him; ſome as Volunteers, to learn the Art of War under ſo Great, ſo Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced a Maſter; ſome as Souldiers of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, who thought by their Valour to recommend themſelves to his Favour, and obtain by that means ſome Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Charge in the Army, the Honour and Profit of which might exalt and maintain them ſuitable to thoſe High
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44408:7"/>
Characters which their Titles deſerved. Among the latter ſort may be reckon'd the Prince of <hi>S—g,</hi> the ſmallneſs of whoſe Principality not affording him an Income agreeable to his High Title, and Higher Mind, he was reſolved to acquire that Plenty which his Fortune had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him, and ſhow by his Valour, that he was nothing beholding to her for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him Titles, but rather that ſhe was unkind, in not giving him as plentiful a Revenue, as ſuited with the largeneſs of his Heart, and the vaſter extent of his Merit. To this intent he came over Sea in a ſmall Command, if we conſider him as a Prince, though in a Poſt eminent enough to give him ſome occaſions of publiſhing his Valour; 'twas in this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he was, when our Forces were from all parts drawing together to inveſt <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick,</hi> in order to which our Prince was to march through <hi>Clonmell,</hi> a City in the County of <hi>Tipperary,</hi> ſcituated in a large Plain near the <hi>Sewer,</hi> now grown obſcure, formerly famous for the great Battel fought juſt by it, between two Brothers who were Competitors for the Crown of <hi>Mounſter;</hi> when that famous Iſland had five Crowned Heads to Govern its Inhabitants. It was the Chief Street
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44408:7"/>
of this Town our Prince was marching through, on Horſe-back, at the Head of his Men, bowing low to both ſides, which were fill'd all along with People, who crowded thither to ſee thoſe Arms which were to ſecure them from the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of their Liberty and Religion; when lifting up his Eyes towards the Windows, which were fill'd with the chief Gentry of the City, he eſpied in one of them a Beauty which fixed his ſight, as if ſhe alone were worthy his Attention:</p>
               <p>He continued looking that way, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not his Eyes off the Window, till the fieryneſs of his Horſe (which could not indure to ſtand ſtill) had carried him beyond the Houſe, and left the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Proſpect behind him; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he was ſo wholly taken up with the thoughts of what he had ſeen, that he rode on without regarding which way, till one of his Officers rode up, and told him that his Highneſs was paſt the Houſe which was deſigned him for his Lodging:</p>
               <p>The P. at this began to recollect himſelf, and giving Orders concerning the good Behaviour of his Souldiers, gave them leave to repair to their ſeveral Quarters, whilſt he by the Head Officers was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to his; after ſome Ceremonies
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44408:8"/>
paſt they repaired to their reſt, and left the Prince at liberty to take as much of his, as the inquietude of his Thoughts would permit him. He found himſelf tired with Travelling, and deſirous of reſt, yet incapable of taking any:</p>
               <p>He found his Thoughts much diſorder'd, and went to Bed to ſee whether Sleep would compoſe them:</p>
               <p>His Soul, like the Bodies of thoſe that have the Rheumatiſm, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med very weary; yet as their Limbs are ſtill uneaſie, though on the ſofteſt Beds, ſo was his Mind; and coveted ſleep as much as their Limbs do reſt, and could as little obtain it. O Love, thou moſt dangerous Diſtemper of the Soul! moſt dangerous becauſe we do not perceive Thee, till Thou art too far gone to be cured:</p>
               <p>Thou ſubtle Enemy! who takeſt the ſtrongeſt Hearts, becauſe Thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways uſeſt Surpriſe; and undermining our Reaſon, never appeareſt in the light, till Thou art too far enter'd to be driven out: 'Twas thus, Treacherous Deity, Thou didſt overcome our Prince, by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking him when he leaſt was aware of Thee; he little feared Hoſtility in a Town which he enter'd as a Friend; nor did he expect that one, and that of the weaker Sex, ſhould offer him Violence
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44408:8"/>
at the head of his Battalion. He ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the true Cauſe ſo little, that he wonder'd at his own inquietude, and could not imagine what it was that could keep him awake on a ſoft Bed, who uſed to ſleep ſo ſound in the Camp on a hard Quilt, and often on the Ground:</p>
               <p>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, awake he lay all night, and did not once cloſe his Eyes, till day-light ſhone in at his Window:</p>
               <p>At the Sun's firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance he got up, quite weary of his Bed, where he had the worſt Nights reſt he ever took in his Life; for though he had indured the hardſhip of many a cold night in Winter Camps; yet they all ſeemed eaſie and pleaſant, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of this one Night's Fatigue; for all the thoughts in thoſe Camps of Blood and War, the dread of a neighbouring E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and the next day's Battel, were not ſo troubleſome to his Repoſe, as thoſe of his coming into this Town:</p>
               <p>The whole Scene of his entrance intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into his Thoughts; the Noiſe and Hurry of the People was ſtill in his Ears; and the Window, and the Charming Spectator that looked out of it, ſeemed ſtill before his Eyes:</p>
               <p>Though he ſcarce miſtruſted that it was gone ſo far with him, as to be in Love; yet he was very
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44408:9"/>
deſirous to come in Company with that beautiful-Stranger, who had been ſo much in his Thoughts, and to ſatisfie himſelf whether ſhe was really ſo Lovely, as ſhe appeared at a diſtance:</p>
               <p>But neither knowing her Name, nor the place where ſhe lived, he imagined that nothing but accident could bring him to a ſecond ſight of her; but as he was muſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the difficulty of finding her out, <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> the Gentleman of his Horſe, came to bid him Good-morrow, and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, That two or three great Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers were below, waiting for admittance to ſpeak with him:</p>
               <p>The Prince, who was glad of any thing that might be an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement to his troubled Mind, ſent for them up, and received them with a great deal of Civility:</p>
               <p>After the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, the Prince told them, He had Orders to await the King's coming to the Town; and after ſome diſcourſe of the Progreſs of Affairs in general, they began to talk of the pleaſure of Company, and how they ſhould ſpend thoſe few days which they were to paſs in the Town:</p>
               <p>One propoſed Training the Souldiers, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Tavern, and the third a Conſort of Muſick; and when every one had paſt their Votes, the Prince bad <hi>Celadon</hi> give
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44408:9"/>
his:</p>
               <p>This <hi>Celadon</hi> was a young brisk <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cavalier, of a ſmall Stature, but a Soul ſufficiently Great, and which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd to think that the littleneſs of his Body made him inferior to any one, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in open Valour in the Field, or the management of an Intrigue at home:</p>
               <p>And certainly never was any ones Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour more equally divided, between Love and War, than his:</p>
               <p>He was an exact Volunteer in both, and as he would hazard his Perſon any time, and fight for him that would give him the beſt Promotion, ſo was he no leſs a Souldier of Fortune in Love than War; would change his ſide often, offer his Service to every Lady that would accept of it, and ſtill was moſt hers, who was readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to reward him:</p>
               <p>He was the Younger Brother of a good Family; and having gone into Forreign Camps for a Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, he had by his Courage, Wit, and Good Fortune, raiſed himſelf ſo high into the Prince's favour, as to be made his Gentleman of Horſe; he being to ſpeak in his turn, told the Prince, That ſince they had left him a deciding Vote, he was for trying each of them by turns; and if they would begin with the Muſick firſt, he would add to it one of his own
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44408:10"/>
moſt delighting Divertiſements, the Company of Women; and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, if the Prince pleaſed to be that Night at the Ball, he would take care to invite all the young Gentry of the Town to it:</p>
               <p>The Prince told him he was the ſame he always thought him; that <hi>Celadon</hi> that took Love to be as important an Affair of Life, as either Eating or Drinking, and accordingly provided for it as carefully; this raille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry brought on other diſcourſe, which laſted while <hi>Celadon</hi> went to make pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for the Ball; at laſt he came back and told them that all things were ready, and the Company invited. On one ſide of the Town ſtood a large Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Houſe, which though not built af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Dorick</hi> Order, or the exacter neatneſs of Courtly Lodgings, yet its largeneſs gave liberty to gueſs at the Magnificence and Hoſpitality of the Owner:</p>
               <p>It belonged to the Great <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> famous all over the Kingdom for his Riches, particularly in his flocks of Sheep, as numerous as thoſe of the mighty <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian,</hi> whoſe Son was the Terror of the World; or that Rich Man of the Eaſt, whom the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Chronicles make Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great:</p>
               <p>All his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44408:10"/>
Ground, far and near, was thick covered with his fleecy Wealth:</p>
               <p>You would hare thought by their bleatings that you were in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> and Shepherdiſm coming in faſhion again: 'Twas this Houſe which was pitched upon for the Ball; and what place ſo fit for Dancing and innocent Mirth, as a ſpacious Hall, whoſe Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Size, and Furniture, altogether ruſtical, imprinted ſuch lively Idea's of Country Freedom, and Country Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence:</p>
               <p>Hither <hi>Celadon</hi> conducted our Prince and his Martial Company; their Muſick was as good as the Town could afford, and their Reception ſuitable to the Riches and Hoſpitality of him that entertain'd them. The Prince, who went thither, rather to ſhun his former thoughts, than out of any inclination to the Company, or the Dancing, ſat by, a Looker-on:</p>
               <p>Some of the Officers who were not ſo ſeriouſly bent, took out thoſe whoſe Face, Meen, or Shape plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them the beſt, and in their ſeveral Dances either ſhewed their Skill, or at leaſt pleaſed themſelves with the conceit that they did ſo. <hi>Celadon,</hi> who always employed ſuch a time as this well, was not idle now; but gazed on one, talked to another bowed to the third, and left
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44408:11"/>
none of the Ladies unregarded; and as a cunning Hound, when he comes among a Herd of Deer, ſingles out the beſt, and never changes Scent, till he runs him down, ſo our skillful Hunter, who knew all the Mazes, Turnings, and Doublings in the courſe of Love, ranged through all the Company of the fairer Sex, till he lighted on the handſomeſt. He would not leave her, till he had prevailed with her to be his Partner in a Country Dance; and tho' till ſhe was drawn out few obſerved her, becauſe either Chance, or her own Modeſty had placed her in a dark part of the Room, yet when ſhe came into the light, ſhe alone drew the admiration of all the Men, as ſhe did the envy of the Women:</p>
               <p>Her face was oval and ſomewhat thin, as if grief had but newly left it, yet her looks were as chearful, as if it had not left the leaſt impreſſion on her mind; ſome ſigns of the Small-pox were juſt perceivable, yet they and her thinneſs, inſtead of leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſerved rather to increaſe the repute of her Beauty, while they ſhew'd how it had triumphed over thoſe two great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers of the handſomeſt Faces:</p>
               <p>Her Forehead was high and ſmooth, as if no Frown had ever deformed it to a wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44408:11"/>
and as much beyond the whiteneſs of the reſt of her Sex, as theirs is beyond the browner Complexion of ours; her Neck, and all the parts of her Face were equally Snowy, except her Cheeks; but they, as if they received their colour from the Rays which her Eyes darted down on them, were of ſuch a lively Carnation, as if that and the reſt of her Face were at a ſtrife, which of thoſe two Colours were the beſt. Her Eyes were of the ſame azure of the cleareſt Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Skyes, and, like them too, ſo ſhining, that it would dazle you to look on them, and her Brows, which grew over them in an exact Arch, were inclining to a light colour, as if they got it from the brightneſs of thoſe Beams which ſhone from beneath them. Her Stature was neither ſo low as that Sex uſually is, nor ſo till as to ſeem too maſculine; her Shape was curiouſly ſlender, and all her Limbs after a feminine delicacy, but ſhe had withall a Deportment ſo Great and ſo Majeſtick, that the comelineſs of the ſtronger Sex was mixed with the graces of the weaker:</p>
               <p>And that the ſtatelineſs of her Carriage ſeemed to command that Love and Adoration, which the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her Face did invite to. I will
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44408:12"/>
not deſcribe how ſhe was dreſt, let thoſe Ladies be ſet off with ſuch helps, who like Peacocks owe their Price to their Feathers; hers were no part of her Beauty, they were put on for Modeſty, not for Ornament; and ſerved her as Clouds do the Sun, to ſcreen her more glorious Beauties from the Eyes of weak Mankind, who would elſe be as infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ruined by the ſight of the one, as by the exceſſive heat of the other. The Prince, who ſate looking on the Dance, no ſooner ſaw her, but he knew her to be the ſame whom he had ſeen in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and whom he ſo much longed to come acquainted with, he was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verjoy'd that he had gotten an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity he ſo little expected; he was ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to ſpeak to her, and ſo impatient till the Dance was over, that any one who had obſerved him might eaſily have perceived it:</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Dance was ended, he call'd to <hi>Celadon,</hi> and telling him that he could not but be weary, prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to ſupply his place: <hi>Celadon,</hi> with a great deal of ſubmiſſion told him, that he was willing to reſign any place to his Highneſs, and ſo ſate down:</p>
               <p>In the mean time a Tune began, and the Lady waited for her Partner; but when ſhe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44408:12"/>
ſaw the Prince come, ſhe bluſh'd, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired his Highneſs would pardon her, if ſhe pray'd him to chuſe another, becauſe ſhe was weary:</p>
               <p>The Prince would not allow of that excuſe; but when ſhe Danced ſeveral times wrong, and put the Company out, and was out of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance her ſelf, he thought her bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proceeded from her not underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Dance, and ſo accepted the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, and ſate down with her. Having a mind to diſcourſe with her, and not having ſo good a command of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Tongue, he ſpoke to her in <hi>French,</hi> and asked her, did ſhe underſtand him? ſhe anſwered him again in the ſame Language:</p>
               <q rend="margQuotes">Sir, I have juſt ſuch a ſmattering of it as you have of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but your Highneſs ſhows me ſo wiſe a Preſident, of not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing to diſcourſe in a Language which I cannot expreſs my ſelf well in, that I ought to follow it, and dare no more ſpeak <hi>French</hi> to your Highneſs, than you will <hi>Engliſh</hi> to me.</q>
               <q rend="margQuotes">Madam, <hi>ſaid the Prince,</hi> though you ſpeak the <hi>French</hi> Tongue ſo prettily, that one does not know which becomes your Mouth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that, or your own, yet e're a one of them is thrown away on you; for that tempting Face ſpeaks ſo much of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44408:13"/>
it ſelf, that had Nature ty'd up your Tongue, yet your Looks alone have power enough to lead all Mankind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray, and draw them more attractive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after you by their Eyes, than the moſt perſwading Eloquence can by the Ears.</q>
               <q rend="margQuotes">Sir, <hi>replyed the Lady,</hi> Had your Highneſs made theſe Compliments to ſome celebrated Beauty, cuſtom would have prepared her an Anſwer; but to one that is ſo unuſed to them as I am, they come ſo unexpected, that I muſt deſiſt Diſcourſing, as I did juſt now from Dancing, not ſo much becauſe I am weary of it, as becauſe I do not know how to go on; and really, with us Country Maids, our Tongues walk like our Feet, and as our Country Dances follow an eaſie methodical way, ſo does our Talk; whilſt your Court Wit, like your dances, are ſo made up of Art in one place, a cunning Jeſt, or a hard Step in another; your Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, like your Feet, do caper ſo high, and are ſo nimble, that our plainneſs ſeems ridiculous in both, and yours is ſo difficult to us, that it gives us no hope of ever arriving to as much as a faint imitation.</q>
               <q rend="margQuotes">Dancing, <hi>ſaid the Prince,</hi> was deſign'd in imitation of

Courtſhip, the Ladies flying off from the Man to ſhew her Coyneſs; her ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times coming forward, and ſometimes retiring, her inconſtancy; and their meeting at laſt ſignifies their Marriage; now if the Faſhion be here as 'tis in our. Country, to kiſs at laſt, i'faith, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I'll leave Poets and Dancing-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to ſhew their Skill in Talking and Dancing, and care not how unskillful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I go on in either, ſo that I may be ſure of my reward in the end:</q>
               <q rend="margQuotes">If you go no farther than a bare kiſs, <hi>replyed the Lady ſmiling,</hi> few would refuſe your Highneſs that reward, to have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Dancing with you; but if you carry on the Simile ſo far as to relate to Marriage, your Highneſs ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the ſport of Courtſhip, like that of Dancing, is quite gone when it comes to the kiſs; and no more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure remains afterwards to the poor tired Dancers, than that of thinking it over again; for then, as an old ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ours has it, our dancing days are gone.</q>
               <p>As ſhe ſpoke thoſe words, the Dance ended, and ſome of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany coming up to hearken to their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, the Lady roſe from her Seat, and took her leave; the Prince could neither
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44408:14"/>
perſuade her to ſtay, nor to give him leave to wait on her home; then he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know where ſhe lived, but ſhe begg'd his Pardon:</p>
               <p>The Prince, who was reſolved to know her, ſent his Page to obſerve her, and to take notice where ſhe lodged, and ſo fell in talk with the other Company, continuing it with one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till the lateneſs of the night broke up the Ball, and ſent every one to his ſeveral home; the Prince had not been long at his, e're the Page came and brought him word, that he had houſed the Lady in the High-ſtreet, that ſhe lived there with a Gentlewoman who was her Mother-in-law:</p>
               <p>The Prince who was ſo uneaſie before, and ſo deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſee her, ſince he had that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view he wiſhed for, began to be more at eaſe, though more in Love than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and whereas his thoughts were formerly diſtracted ſeveral ways, now they ran all on her; the Ball, the Dancing, and all the reſt of the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment was as faintly remembred, as if he had only ſeen them in a Dream; but what ſhe had ſaid or done, was as freſh, as if it were that very moment act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over again:</p>
               <p>One while he fancied he ſaw her Dancing, another, that he
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44408:14"/>
ſaw with what a grace ſhe ſpake, and every word of her diſcourſe was as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in his memory, as if they were the only ones engraven there; no wonder if thoſe who will not give credit to the Stories of Apparitions, ſay, the Perſons are deluded by the exceſs of Fear, and the ſtrength of their own Fancies, for the force of imagination is as ſtrong in Love as it is in Fear, and makes the cheated Amouriſt ſtill think he ſees the Fair one, and though ſhe be an hundred mile off, yet her Face, her Ayr, her Meen, and every thing that formerly pleaſed his ſight, ſeems ſtill to dance before it:</p>
               <p>And as the guilty Conſcience of the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer preſents the Fantom of the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to his view, ſo Lovers are haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Spectres too, only the Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers appear in a dreadful, the Lovers in a pleaſing Form. This Night had our Prince ſeveral of theſe delightful Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which were ſo intruding, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Reaſon could baniſh them while he was awake, nor Sleep free him from them in his Dreams; as ſoon as he wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked he ſent for <hi>Celadon,</hi> and having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him to ſhut the Door, and ſit down on his Bed-ſide, he ſpake thus to him.</p>

                     <p>After ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving begg'd your Highneſs's Pardon, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> for my rudeneſs in leaving you, I'll tell ſuch an accident which befell me ſince, that your Highneſs will think a ſufficient puniſhment for it:</p>
                     <p>While you were Singing, I ſaw at a little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſomething, which, by the white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I gueſſed to be either a Ghoſt, or a Woman, and as I am not afraid of either, my Curioſity prompted me to ſee which it was, I walked that way, and found it to be, not a Ghoſt, but which was worſe, a Shee-Devil in a Night-rail, by which I concluded it to be of that Sex which I had moſt incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to keep company with at that time of Night; the place too ſeemed to favour the Temptation, being an old Abby, where there was no body nigh to interrupt us:</p>
                     <p>When I came near her, ſhe broke ſilence firſt, and ſaid, <q rend="inline italic">O Lord, Sir, you have ſtaid very long, I have been waiting for you this hour:</q> Tho' at firſt, by her ſtanding there, I thought her Common, yet theſe words made me take her for ſome Lover who had

made an Aſſignation; I was reſolved to perſonate him whom the meeting was deſigned for; and leſt ſhe ſhould know my Voice, I anſwer'd in a low tone, that buſineſs hinder'd me, but I would ſoon make amends for my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence:</p>
                  </q> Juſt as he ſpoke this laſt word, be runs to the Chamber-door, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeized a Maid of the Houſe, he hall'd her in, crying out, <q rend="inline italic">This is the Jilt that play'd me the trick, but I'll be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on her:</q> The Maid half dead with fear, could ſay nothing for her ſelf, but cry'd to the Prince for help; he ſeeing her gentilely dreſt, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'twas his Landlord's Daughter, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed his Authority, and ordering the Door to be ſhut, commanded <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to be calmer, till he enquired into the matter, and asked the Stranger whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe knew what was the reaſon of his Anger:</p>
               <p>The Maid deſiring that his Highneſs would hear her, and then judge between them, began thus: <q rend="margQuotes">
                     <p>I perceive by this Gentleman's Anger, that he has been groſly abuſed; that I have been in ſome ſort the cauſe, I am ſorry; but to ſhew you I am a very innocent one, I'll give you a relation of ſome paſſages of my life, which

though publickly known, yet never ſhould have been told you by me, were it not on ſuch an important account as this, the allaying this Gentleman's rage againſt me, and the hindering him from noiſing any thing abroad, which might be to the prejudice of my Reputation:</p>
                     <p>My Father is a Country Gentleman, deſcended from a good Family, but his Anceſtors were ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provident, as to ſpend moſt of their Eſtate, and leave him but a ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder to maintain a great many Children:</p>
                     <p>I am the youngeſt of all, the Favourite both of Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe greateſt care has been to Match me ſo, that they may live to ſee me happy. I had choice enough; for theſe three or four years I have had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reſt from Suitors, who from all parts of the Country ſollicited me:</p>
                     <p>My Fortune, I believe, they did not court me for, becauſe I ſaw ſeveral who had far greater were neglected; People flatter'd me indeed with the title of a Beauty, and Fame, who is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly a great Lyar; did liſt my Name among her wonders; whether ſhe was in the wrong or no, I could wiſh ſhe were, for it has put me to more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44408:19"/>
than a good Face is worth, to bear with the ſeveral impertinencies of my young Country Servants; though to have ſeen their ſeveral humours would have been as good as a Comedy to me, had I been meerly a Spectator, but I loſt the pleaſure becauſe I was an Actreſs in it my ſelf:</p>
                     <p>Every one of them had a particular behaviour, yet every one ſomething of the <hi>Harlequin</hi> in it; and their Courtſhip was different, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their diverſity of humours:</p>
                     <p>One had Confidence, and thought that would gain me, and he'd be the moſt troubleſome, becauſe he'd touze me and hale me about, and I had much ado to defend my ſelf from his rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; him I avoided as I would the Devil. Another would think to gain me by his over-civility, and he'd come a great way juſt to ask me how I did, and how my Father and Mother did, ask me what a Clock it was, and what time of the Moon, and where I was at Church laſt <hi>Sunday;</hi> and after ſome ſuch wiſe diſcourſe, he'd take a kiſs and be gone; he was my Chip in Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge, I neither ſhunn'd his Company, nor cared for it. A third, pufft up with the good ſucceſs of having gotten
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44408:19"/>
his Father's Maid, or Tenant's Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with Child, believed the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods would conquer me, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought to entertain me with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt diſcourſe; my Vertue made me deaf to all he could ſay, and for my Reputation ſake I avoided him. Then a Widower came, a Couſen, addreſſed to me, deſiring to be nearer a-kin, and thought to touch my heart, but indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured it after ſo rude a manner, as if he forgot that 'twas a Maid, not a Widow, he was Courting:</p>
                     <p>But it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, for all his long practiſing Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe, that he did not underſtand how to Purchaſe, for all that he had in the World could not buy my conſent to give him mine. A fifth was opiniona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of his ruſtick valour, and he'd aim at conquering his Miſtreſs the ſame way as Knights Errant did of old, by quarrelling and beating every one he came near:</p>
                     <p>But I thought ſuch an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-boyling Courage, which would ſtill expoſe me to fears for him, was fitter for a Bravo, than a Husband. The ſixth was my true Country Courtier, who was all Innocence; he had ſcarce Courage enough to keep him from ſwooning, when he came into my
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44408:20"/>
Company, unleſs his Spirits had been raiſed before-hand, by a dram of the Bottle, or a belly full of ſtrong drink; then he'd ſay, his Mother ſent him to ask me whether I'd have him; and tell me a long ſtory of his Ground, his Dairy, and his Cattle; I deſpiſed this Milk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſop, and thought it a hard bargain to give my ſelf in ſubjection to the chief Beaſt, only to be Miſtreſs of the reſt. This was my condition, when a young Gentleman, a Stranger, came down into our Country to ſome Friends he had there; and no ſooner ſaw me, than he encreaſed the number of my Captives, and profeſſed himſelf my Servant, but when he firſt old it me, 'twas with all the Rhetorick which an ingenious paſſion could invent, his Eyes, his Actions, and every geſture ſo gracefully ſeconded his Story, that the Lover's part, which the others acted ſo ridiculouſly, became him ſo well, as if he were only made for Love. When he paid a viſit, if any of the reſt chanced to come at the ſame time, the Breeding which he brought from <hi>Dublin,</hi> elevated him ſo far above them, in his Diſcourſe, his Carriage, and all he did, that they did look like our
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44408:20"/>
wild <hi>Iriſh</hi> to him; but when alone he talked to me of Love, the Muſick of his Tongue was ſo enchanting, I could have ſtaid and liſten'd for ever to him. Sir, I will ſay no more in his commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, for methinks Lovers are ſo much a part of our ſelves, that their praiſes look fulſome where they come from one another, I will only tell your Highneſs that we were but too happy in one another, till Fortune, who is never conſtantly kind, contrived a way to part us aſunder:</p>
                     <p>But why ſhould we curſe our ill Fortune, or lay the fault on the Devil, when any miſchance does befall us? Whereas poor <hi>Beelze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub</hi> is wrong'd, for he could not do us half the miſchiefs we receive, unleſs we helped him againſt one another, and of all people I think the Envious are his principal Agents, of which this is a remarkable inſtance:</p>
                     <p>There lived in the ſame Houſe with him, one <hi>Capella,</hi> a ſtale Maid, of a good Family, but a decayed Fortune, and ſhe, it ſeems, hearing of our Amour, envied the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of it:</p>
                     <p>I can't ſay 'twas out of any violent Love to him, for her being pretty far advanced in years, and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſides, do make me think her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44408:21"/>
time was paſt, at leaſt I'm ſure it ſhould have been, for her grey Hairs, her Dwarfiſhneſs, her Sicklineſs, her Pale Ill-favoured Face, and her want of a Fortune to gild all theſe Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, might have hindered her from thinking of Marriage, if ſhe had any Wit to conſider them; but ſhe will repent the want of it, when the fooliſh deſire of Intriguing in her old Age, has rendered her ridiculous to all the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and after waſting her Youth in Pride and Diſdain of thoſe that more than deſerved her, make her take up at laſt, for want of a better, with a Ploughman, a Groom, or a Footman. I fear your Highneſs will think this a very illnatur'd Character, but I will beg you to conſider, that it proceeds from her own deſerts, and the reſentment an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured Love does uſually raiſe in our Breaſts, againſt thoſe who are the chief cauſes of our unhappineſs; as certainly ſhe was of mine, for the Nets ſhe often, and in vain, ſpread for others, were now laid for him:</p>
                     <p>And becauſe ſhe thought the Love of me diverted him; after having with Jeers and Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Scorn and Flattery, Anger and Kindneſs, and all the different ways
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44408:21"/>
ſhe could think on, in vain attempted to ſhake his Conſtancy; she was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make me loſe him, though ſhe loſt him her ſelf by it; and getting ſome of her Relations to repreſent me to his, as diſadvantageouſly as they could, they (leſt he ſhould loiter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Youth in Love, and not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue that Preferment to which his Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us was likely to raiſe him) called him up to <hi>Dublin.</hi> I, partly to huſh the diſcourſe which her Malice had raiſed of us, about the Countrey, partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it made me melancholly, to ſee thoſe deſerted Shades, where I had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been ſo happy, quitted that place, and choſe my Aunt's Houſe, where your Highneſs is, now, for my retirement. He came to Town, <hi>incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito,</hi> to ſee me, and for fear ſome of his Friends ſhould hear of it, our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were always in private. An Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey hard by (being ſolitary and free from any company that might diſturb us) we pitched upon for our laſt nights Aſſignation:</p>
                     <p>I was there firſt, and this Gentleman coming by, I miſtook him for the other:</p>
                     <p>He'll own himſelf that he began to be too familiar, and leſt he ſhould offer me violence at that time
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44408:22"/>
of night, when no body was near to help me, I was driven to this ſhift to get rid of him:</p>
                     <p>I ſaw which way his nature inclined him, and thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded there was no way to deliver my ſelf, but by putting him in hopes of ſome better Intrigue; I therefore told him, I would not detain him from my Miſtreſſes's Embraces, who had been waiting for him this long while (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending I miſtook him for ſome other Gentleman) and ſo drew him from thence, deſigning at the firſt Houſe I ſaw any up, to pretend ſhe was there, and ſo leave him:</p>
                     <p>I durſt not come home with him, leſt the vexation of finding himſelf deceiv'd, ſhould make him raiſe the Houſe, and to come home with an Officer at that time of Night, would have ruined me in my Aunt's good opinion. It fell out as well as I could wiſh, for an Ale-houſe was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and deſiring him to go and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for her there, I bad him good night, and came home as faſt as my fear could carry me:</p>
                     <p>What became of him after I know not, only deſire that he would impute it to his own Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if he has ſuffered; and that both your Highneſs and he will be ſo honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44408:22"/>
as to keep what I have related from others Ears, as ſtrictly as I would have kept it from yours, had I not been conſtrained to reveal it in juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of mine Honour.</p>
                  </q> The Prince, who had liſtened with delight to the Love-ſtory, it jumping ſo well with the humour he was then in, told the young Gentlewoman, that he had a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for her, as ſhe was a Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and ſo near a Relation of his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies, but more, as ſhe was Beautiful, Vertuous, and a Lover, and wiſhed her a great deal of Succeſs. <hi>Celadon</hi> begg'd a thouſand pardons for the rudeneſs his Ignorance had betray'd him to; and that ſhe might be the more inclined to pardon him, he deſired her to ſtay, and hear the unlucky adventure he had after ſhe left him. The Prince deſired her to ſeat her ſelf, and <hi>Celadon</hi> with half a ſmile, and a bluſh together, thus continued his Story. You may remember, Madam, that I promiſed you to make amends for my long ſtay, and went about to be as good as my word, had not your Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Cunning reſtrained me more than my own:</p>
               <p>And tho' I have all along ſaid that no Woman could reſiſt Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity and Importunity, yet now I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44408:23"/>
my Error, and could my ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Proſelyte to Chaſtity, were I ſo happy as the Gentleman you waited for, I mean, in having ſo Fair, ſo Vertuous a Miſtreſs, to regulate my wandering de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and confine them to her ſelf; as it is, your example, and laſt nights trick put upon me, have half Converted me:</p>
               <p>I will own to you, that I did really think you had miſtaken me for another; I was big with hopes of the Bliſs you promiſed to conduct me to; and 'twas either your wiſdom, or good luck, not to go into the light with me; I ſaw indeed ſo much of you, as to know you again by your Cloaths; but had I ſeen that alluring Face, your feigned Miſtreſs had not ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved your turn; I did not, becauſe I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided your ſeeing mine, for fear you ſhould diſcover me to be the wrong Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:</p>
               <p>For the ſame reaſon, I was loath to ask your Miſtreſs's Name, and choſe rather to enquire for her at a venture, concluding, that if I once came into her Company, the fear of my diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her Amour would over-awe her, and make her as kind to me, as if I were the Spark that ſhe waited for:</p>
               <p>Beſides, the heat of my Inclination puſhed me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at a venture, whether I ſucceeded
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44408:23"/>
or no:</p>
               <p>I went therefore into the Houſe, and asked a Boy at the Bar, whether there was ever a Gentlewoman there who expected me:</p>
               <p>The Boy asked me what her Name was: <q rend="inline italic">What's that to you, <hi>ſaid I?</hi> Is there ever a Gentlewoman in the Houſe?</q> The Boy, who underſtood his Trade, gueſſed what I meant; ſhewed me a Room, and ſent in a Woman to me:</p>
               <p>Her colour was very good, for I believe ſhe was Painted, her Look was brisk, and her Garb gentile enough; for my Garb being pretty rich, they thought to make a good Prize of me, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſent me, I ſuppoſe, the choiceſt Girl in the Houſe. I took her to be the diſtreſſed Wife of ſome old Man, who had married her to make her his Nurſe, and therefore told her it belong'd to my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to help the diſtreſſed. She told me ſhe thought, by my Tone and Whiskers that I was an Out-landiſh Man; asked me how long I had been in Town, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I was a meer ſtranger to that place; pretending as if ſhe was afraid of my coming to the knowledge of whoſe Wife ſhe was. I told her I was an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> had been beyond Sea ſeveral years; that I came to Town but two or three days ago, with the Prince's Troops, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44408:24"/>
ſhould ſuddenly be marching to <hi>Limerick,</hi> and that therefore ſhe ſhould make the better uſe of me while I ſtaid, and never fear a diſcovery afterwards; by this ſhe gueſſed I ſhould never be able to find the Houſe again; and that embolden'd them to deal as they did with me; ſhe ſeemed to be ſo cautious, out of a fear of her Honour; when therefore ſhe had gotten as much knowledge of my being a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as ſatisfied her fears, ſhe began to be more familiar with me, and, out of a particular piece of kindneſs, would needs ſend out for a Bottle of Sack for me, ſaying, ſhe would drink a health to the good man at home; we both laugh'd at the conceit; I, how little he thought of his Horns, and ſhe to think how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle I ſuſpected the Trick ſhe was going to play me:</p>
               <p>The Wine ſhe would needs drink mull'd, and, ordering it her ſelf, ſhe infuſed either Opiate, or ſome ſuch Soporiferous draught; we had no ſooner drank it off, than ſhe conſented to go to Bed, ſaying, that her Husband was out of Town, and the Houſe belonging to a Friend of hers, no body was likely to trouble our pleaſures:</p>
               <p>Becauſe I ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected nothing, I never minded how little ſhe drank; and you know, Madam,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44408:24"/>
we uſually indulge Women their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in drinking, therefore very likely ſhe drank leſs, and ſo it might have leſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration upon her; it worked ſo on me, that I did not wake till late in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and when I firſt opened my Eyes, I found my ſelf in the innermoſt part of the Abby, which I ſaw you at laſt Night; I was laid on a Tombſtone, by the ſide of a great Marble Statue (the Effigies of ſome Great Perſon formerly buried there) I wonder'd to find that my Bed and Bedfellow had both ſuffered ſuch a Niobetick alteration, that they who were ſo ſoft and warm laſt Night, were become ſo hard and cold by Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; but I wonder'd more at my ſelf, when I found no Cloaths, but an old <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Habit on me, I began to think of <hi>Plato</hi>'s tranſmigration, and that I had died an Officer, and for my lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in my former body, was doom'd now to be an abſtinent <hi>Franciſcan:</hi> But I had not much time to think, for by this time, a zealous Neighbour that had ſeen me aſleep, thought he would catch the Frier napping, and brought a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable for me; the Man of Authority order'd me immediately to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Juſtice of Peace. I was conducted
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44408:25"/>
in State through the Streets, at the head of a Party, more numerous than your Highneſs's body of Souldiers; they huz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za'd all the way, as if the King were going by; and methought I went in great Pomp, only my Triumph was after the <hi>Roman</hi> faſhion, with the Lictor behind me, who every now and then threat'ned me with Bridewell, the Stocks, and the Gibbet:</p>
               <p>In this manner I marched near half a mile to the Juſtice's, barefooted all the way, which I think of it ſelf was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent pennance for my laſt nights Debauch:</p>
               <p>The Juſtice asked me a great many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent queſtions; as how I durſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear there in that Habit? and why I did not go after the <hi>French</hi> to <hi>Limerick?</hi> I ſaw it beſt to confeſs what I was, and told him all the latter part of my adventure, how that the People of the Houſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by my own confeſſion, that I was a Stranger, and not likely to find the Houſe again, had robb'd me of all my Cloaths at Mid-night, and left me there in an old Habit, which ſome poor Holy Brother had formerly given them as the return of a kindneſs:</p>
               <p>The Juſtice would not believe but this was a Jeſuitical eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of mine, and therefore bad me, if I was a Souldier, ſend for ſome body that I
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44408:25"/>
was acquainted with; I named two or three Officers of my Acquaintance, and the Juſtice ſent one for them, they were found in a Tavern with a great deal of other Company, and the fellow deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Meſſage publickly, they all came to ſee the Novice in his Habit; their Teſtimony releaſed me, and I was fain to borrow ſome Cloaths to go home in, having loſt a very good Suit of my own, and moſt part of the ready Money I have in the World, and have got nothing for it, but the name of <hi>Celadon</hi> the <hi>Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> which will ſtick by me as long as I live:</p>
               <p>Your Highneſs may ſee now the cauſe of my paleneſs, is the potion I drank, and the cold Lodging I had, which if it had not happen'd at ſuch a hot time of the year, would have made me dye in a more Religious Habit than ever I lived in. You, Madam, if you have any ſuch thing as pity in you, will excuſe me, and think that the ſhame, the loſs, and the cold I ſuffered might be ſufficient cauſe to make me angry with you, whilſt I thought you one of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices. The fair Stranger, with a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying ſmile, told him, That ſhe was ſorry he had ſuffered ſo much by her means, and ſaid, that to ſhew ſhe did
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44408:26"/>
no way conſent to it, ſhe would ſend one who ſhould ſhew him the Houſe; and if he would carry a Conſtable with him, he might recover all his things again. The Prince, who had laughed till he was weary, bad <hi>Celadon</hi> call up the Centry, him he ſent for a File of Musqueteers, and deſiring the beautiful Stranger to ſend a Guide with them to the Houſe, ſent <hi>Celadon</hi> with them. The young Gentlewoman, bidding the Prince good morrow, went to her Uncle and Aunt to give them ſome ſhare of the Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ordering one of the Servants to go with the Souldiers to the Houſe, there <hi>Celadon</hi> found his laſt nights Miſtreſs, and having recovered his Cloaths and his Watch, he ſent for the ſame Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, who had conducted him ſo carefully to the Juſtice's, and leaving his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, and her fellow Nuns to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Juſtice, he came back to the Prince very well ſatisfied that he had come off ſo well, and bought his experience ſo cheap. Though the oddneſs of <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>'s adventure did for ſome time em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the Prince's mind, yet at laſt, by a long chain of thought, he returned to the accuſtomed Subject his Miſtreſs:</p>
               <p>For as the <hi>Jack of the Lanthorn</hi> is ſaid to lead
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44408:26"/>
the benighted Country-man about, and makes him tread many a weary ſtep in fruitleſs rounds, yet leaves him near the ſame place where it found him at firſt; ſo Love's deluding fire, after enticing the blinded mind through many reſtleſs thoughts, brings it about again to its beloved Idea, that enchanting circle it can never leave; 'twas this bewitching Paſſion which brought our Prince from <hi>Celadon</hi>'s adventure to the fair Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and from hers to his own; and when he call'd to mind the Story of her Lover, and his ſucceſs over her heart, he pleaſed himſelf with hopes of the like Fortune in his own Amour, and thought it very probable, that a Prince, who had ſeveral advantages over one of a private Fortune, might expect the ſame ſucceſs, and not fear the like diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, ſince he had no power to over-awe, or check his Love, or Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to controul it. Finding a great deal of diverſion in this melancholly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, he reſolved on a walk, as well to take the Air, as to prevent the engaging himſelf in any Company, which might come to ſeek him at his Lodgings; when he had walked about half a mile, he found himſelf on the top of a Hill,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44408:27"/>
whence after having looked a while on the adjacent Town, and with a curious Eye ſearched out that part of it, which his admired Beauty made happy with her preſence, he laid him down under the ſhade of two or three large Trees, whoſe ſpreading Boughs nature had wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo cloſe together, that neither the heat of the Sun, nor ſtorm of the fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt Wind could violate the pleaſant ſhade, which was made as a general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, no leſs againſt the ſcorching of the one, than the nipping of the other; they ſeemed to have been firſt planted there, for the ſhelter of thoſe who came thither to drink; for juſt by there bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled up a clear and plentiful Spring, of which, from an ancient <hi>Iriſh</hi> Chronicle, let me give you this Story. <hi>Cluaneeſha,</hi> the only Child of <hi>Macbuain,</hi> King of <hi>Munſter,</hi> was accuſed of having been too familiar with one of her Father's Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers; the Fact was atteſted upon Oath by two Gentlemen that waited on the King's Perſon, and to confirm it, the Princeſs her ſelf had ſuch a ſwelling in her, that few doubted but their Witneſs was true, and would ſoon be proved by her being brought to Bed:</p>
               <p>Her Father, being old and ſickly, was deſired, for
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44408:27"/>
the prevention of Civil Wars after his Death, to nominate a Succeſſour:</p>
               <p>The People ſhewed their unanimous conſent to confer the Crown on her Uncle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not have a Strumpet for their Sovereign; ſo the old King was perſwaded to proclaim his Brother Heir Apparent, and condemn his Daughter to a Cloiſter:</p>
               <p>The Courtier fled beyond Sea, and went a Pilgrimage to the Saint at <hi>Poſnanie;</hi> the very night that he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there, one appeared to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Abbeſs, in the form of a Nun glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and told her, that ſhe was <hi>Edith,</hi> Daughter formerly to King— but now in happineſs; that ſhe loved Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity and Innocence while ſhe was on Earth, and therefore defended it ſtill; that ſhe was conſtrained to leave the ſeat of Bliſs to protect Vertue, injured in the Perſon of <hi>Cluaneeſha;</hi> that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who ſwore againſt her were ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born'd; that the ſwelling of her Belly was but a Diſeaſe; and that if ſhe and the witneſſes would go and drink of a Well, which ſprung out of a Hill near <hi>Clonmell,</hi> there ſhe would convince all the Spectators, that what ſhe now told her was true:</p>
               <p>The Abbeſs told this the next day to the King's Confeſſor, and he told
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44408:28"/>
it the King; the King ordered one who was Confeſſor to the two Witneſſes, to enjoin them, for their next pennance, to drink no other Liquor, but the Water of this Well, for a Week together; they obey'd him, but it was their laſt, for it made them ſwell as if they were poiſoned; in the mean time the Mother Abbeſs came down thither with her Royal Novice. She charged them with the Perjury, and they confeſſed publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the King's Brother, taking the advantage of that ſwelling, which he thought was but a Tympany, ſuborned them to ſwear againſt her Chaſtity, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that either it would kill her, or at leaſt it might deceive the People ſo long till the King was dead, and he in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Crown:</p>
               <p>A certain Citizen of <hi>Clonmell,</hi> who came among the reſt to ſee them dying, and heard the Confeſſion, admiring the ſtrange virtue of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, went immediately home to his Wife, and telling her that he was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious of her Honeſty, and deſired that, to ſatisfie his Jealouſie, ſhe would drink a draught of Water, and wiſh it might be her laſt, if ſhe were unfaithful:</p>
               <p>She not having yet heard of the others pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and willing to clear her ſelf,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44408:28"/>
drank of it as he deſired, but ſwell'd with it as the others did, and dyed ſoon after in great torment. When the Well had grown famous by the exemplary deaths of the Perjured Witneſſes, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterate Citizen, the Princeſs declared ſhe would drink of it too; and that the clearing of her ſelf might be as publick as her accuſation was, ſhe ſent up to the King, who was then at <hi>Cork,</hi> to deſire that her Uncle himſelf might be preſent when ſhe drank, to witneſs her inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; he excuſed himſelf, and would not go, but a great many of the Court coming thither to ſee the Princeſs clear her ſelf, ſhe went in ſolemn Proceſſion barefoot, from the City to the Well; and taking up a glaſs full of the Water, ſhe proteſted her Innocence, and uſing the ſame imprecation with the others, if ſhe did not ſpeak the truth, drank it off; but inſtead of working the ſame effect on her, it in a little time cured her of the Diſeaſe ſhe had, recovered her Health, and with it brought her ſo much Beauty, that all the neighbouring Princes were Rivals for her:</p>
               <p>She had deſign'd to build a Nunnery by that Well, but her Father dying left her the cares of a Crown, which diverted her from it:
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44408:29"/>
But the Well was long after reverenced, and for the quality it had of diſcovering Unchaſtity, it was much reſorted to; for the Inhabitants of <hi>Ireland</hi> (how bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous ſoever the partial Chronicles of other Nation report 'em) were too nice in Amour to take a polluted Wife to their Bed, as long as this Well would ſhew them which was a chaſt one; but the wickedneſs of after times grew too guilty to bear with ſuch Tryals; thence by difuſe this Well loſt its Fame, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps its Vertue. And now I will no longer tell ſuch Tales, but leave the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Lover to take his Lot as it comes. Pretty near this Well the Prince lay down, and being pleaſed with the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring of its Stream running down a deſcent of the Hill, that, and his want of Sleep the night before, tempted him to take it now; <hi>Morpheus</hi> was ready at his call, and waving his Leaden Rod o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, lull'd all his Senſes, till a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter power than he reſcued him from ſleep, to Charm him in a more prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling manner; for as he waked he heard one hemm, and found it was in order to Sing, for preſently the unknown, with a raviſhing Air, began this Song.</p>

               <p>The excellency of the Voice, and the ſuitableneſs of the Sence to his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, made him lye ſtill to hearken to her that Sung it, and liſtening very at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively, he over-heard another Voice, which breaking ſilence began thus. I thank you, dear <hi>Marinda,</hi> for the Song, I like the Tune you have put to it, and either that, and the ſweetneſs of your Voice, do make me partial, or elſe the Song is very good:</p>
               <p>I like the Authority it carries with it, for I am uſually well pleaſed when I hear thoſe Songs, which attribute ſo much power to our Sex; but prethee tell me, why is a Souldier the aim of it? when I have heard you ſay, that a Souldier ſhould be your laſt choice,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44408:30"/>
becauſe they are always abroad, and therefore very ſeldom enjoy'd after Marriage, and while they are Suitors their Pride makes them the moſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, and the moſt inconſtant of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; when they pay a viſit, if there be a Glaſs in the Room, they look more on themſelves, than on her they came to ſee, and as often as they look on their Scarf and Feather, their Vanity puffs them up ſo, that if we yield not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, they Swear and Curſe, and ſo fall off, taking it as an unpardonable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front that we don't admire them at firſt ſight; and when they are beloved, their Self-conceit makes them place it to the account of their own Merits, and ſo they value our Love the leſs, becauſe they think it their due; nay, and are not contented with a ſingle Conqueſt, be it ever ſo fine a one, and as they do not fight for Malice, ſo neither do they court for Love, but out of the pure vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory of Conquering; and take as much Pride in having abundance of Miſtreſſes, as abundance of Soldiers to follow them. You obſerve right (<hi>ſaid ſhe who was called</hi> Marinda) I'le grant to you, that for theſe conſiderations, they are both the worſt of Servants, and worſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44408:30"/>
of Husbands, and yet in a brave Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier there is ſomething ſo Noble, I mean in, his not fearing dangers, and his patient endurance of all manner of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, that were it not for the aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd inconveniencies of Abſence, Pride, and Inconſtancy, I ſhould have a greater value for ſuch a one, than ever I yet had for any other Employment:</p>
               <p>Nay, now <hi>Marinda (reply'd the other)</hi> you make good the Character which our Sex bears among the Men, of being inconſtant as the Wind; for 'twas but two or three days ago you were of a clear contrary Opinion, and you knew the ſame quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Courage and Hardineſs to be then in a Souldier which you do now, and therefore they are no juſt reaſons why you ſhould alter your mind; they make ſome ſhew of being Arguments indeed, but I have obſerved that Wits, when they alter their Opinions, whether it be in point of Religion, Allegiance, or any thing elſe, never want ſomething to ſay in their own defence:</p>
               <p>Well, ſince you are ſo deſirous (<hi>ſaid</hi> Marinda) to know the cauſe of this alteration of humour in me, I'll tell it you; though in doing ſo, I rather follow the dictates of Friendſhip than Diſcretion, and prove
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44408:31"/>
kinder to you than to my ſelf, in telling you that which I am almoſt aſhamed to think of. You know that about three or four days ago a Party of Foreigners made their entrance into this Town, with the Prince of <hi>S—g</hi> at the head of them, Curioſity made me open my Window to ſee them paſs by, either the deſire of looking about him, or the pride of being gazed at, made the Prince ride ſlower by that place than ordinary, and he had his deſign, for I looked as ſtedfaſtly on him, as if he had been the only Pageant there; and tho', without doubt, there were ſeveral Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers very brave and fine; yet the ſeeing him firſt had ſo prejudiced me in favour of him, that I could not think the reſt worth the looking on; all the reſt of that day I could not forbear thinking of him, fancying I ſaw with what a Grace he ſat his Horſe, how ſtately he look'd, ſo far beyond the reſt of his Souldiers, as if na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as well as Fortune, had marked him out for a Prince and diſtinguiſhed him from the reſt, as much by his perſon, as by his power; and as the thoughts of the day have an effect upon thoſe at night, ſo I believe theſe were the cauſe of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſturbed in my Bed with this Dream.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44408:31"/>
The Prince, methought, in my abſence, had hidden himſelf in my Bed-chamber, and, when I came in, ſtarted out upon me:</p>
               <p>He had on one ſide of him a little wing'd Archer, who bent his Bow, and aimed at me ſeveral times; but juſt by me there ſtarted up a great Gigantick form, with no other Arms but a Shield, and he, methought, ſtill interpoſed that, and with it kept off the Arrows of the other; at length, methought, the Prince ſpoke ſomething which tempted my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender over to his ſide, and left me to the Mercy of the young Archer, who ſhot me through and through; and at the ſame inſtant the Prince came and catched me in his Arms, and told me I was his Priſoner, at which, methought, I ſwooned away with a pleaſing pain, and at the fright of it I awaked. People ſay Dreams are ſignificant, if they are, tell me what you think is the meaning of this? Why truly, <hi>(ſaid the other)</hi> any one who ſhould hear you tell this, might gueſs, without any great skill in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-telling, that you are in Love:</p>
               <p>If (<hi>ſaid</hi> Marinda) I did think a little the day before upon the Prince, which might have been the cauſe <hi>(as you ſay)</hi> of this Dream, yet thoſe thoughts were too
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44408:32"/>
ſlightly grounded to be of any long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, and I was in hopes in a day or two to have clearly rooted them out; and the next Afternoon one of my Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance came to deſire my Company to a Ball, I was ready enough to accept of the proffer, becauſe I imagined that the Muſick and the Company would cure me of my thoughtfulneſs; but (as my ill Fate would have it) it was clear contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for whom ſhould I meet at the Ball but the Prince; you were there, and ſaw how I was clearly put out of my Dance, with the confuſion his preſence put me in:</p>
               <p>He ſate down with me, and made me ſome few Compliments, which tho', perhaps, were coveted by ſome of the Company, yet had thoſe Ladies ſeen my inſide, as well as they did my outſide, they would rather have pitied, than envied me; 'twas he that ſung under my Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow laſt night, and though you miſtook him for your Servant, yet I knew his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding Voice too well:</p>
               <p>His words were ſo pathetical, and the Tune ſo moving, that though he had skill enough at the Guittar, which he plaid on, yet that kept not time with his Voice truer than my Pulſe and Heart did. Have a care <hi>Marinda (ſaid the other)</hi> that you do
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44408:32"/>
not engage too far with one who is ſo much above you; 'tis not ſafe Intriguing with Perſons of his Quality; Inferiour Lovers may be jeſted with as long as we pleaſe, and thrown off at will, but ſuch as he ſeldom leave us without carrying away our Vertue, or at leaſt our Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:</p>
               <p>And you will too late curſe your own Charms when they have expoſed you to be ruined (like a young Conjurer) by raiſing a Spirit which you are not able to lay. I fear (<hi>reply'd</hi> Marinda) he has ſpy'd ſomething in my behaviour that (he fancied) favoured him, as Mens conceitedneſs makes them too apt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſuch things; I am ſorry for it, if I did diſcover any weakneſs in my ſelf, that ſhould encourage him to ſuch an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt:</p>
               <p>I am ſure my Tongue never dropt the leaſt word in his favour; and if my tell-tale Eyes, or my Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance has betray'd me, I'll disfigure this Countenance, and tear out theſe Eyes, rather than they ſhall invite, or aſſiſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enterprize, to the prejudice of my Vertue. Now though I have told the Reader the diſcourſe theſe Ladies had in private, yet let him not expect that I ſhall tell him the Prince's thoughts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; that I ſhould not be able to do,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44408:33"/>
though I had been in his heart, for they were ſo different, that he ſcarce knew what to make of them himſelf:</p>
               <p>He cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly had need of a great preſence of mind, to reſolve upon ſuch a ſudden what to do, whether to diſcover himſelf, or no:</p>
               <p>If he did, he ſaw ſome probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that the Lady might be kinder, when ſhe knew that he had heard her confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Love for him; if he did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt them, he thought he might hear more; but while he was in this irreſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he chanced to Sneeze, at which the Ladies aroſe from the ſeat which they were on by the Well, and walked away, very likely becauſe they found ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was nearer than they had imagined, and were afraid of being over-heard in their diſcourſe:</p>
               <p>The Prince lay a while mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on what he had heard, and then went home; he related it all to <hi>Celadon,</hi> and asked his advice what uſe he ſhould make of it: <hi>Celadon</hi> told him it was not the ſafeſt way to extort a confeſſion of Love from her, by letting her know he had over-heard her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that might make her angry at his hearkening, and ſuch a diſcovery might be too violent for a Maiden Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, and ſo nice a one as hers ſeemed
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44408:33"/>
to be; he deſired him rather to continue his Addreſſes, and ſo bring her by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to a voluntary ſubmiſſion; that this was the more natural and the ſurer way; that twice or thrice more being in her Company would enſure his Conqueſt over her; and what need was there to hazard her diſpleaſure, by forcing her to confeſs ſhe loved him, when he was well enough ſatisfied of it already? The Prince conſented to this, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived this way to ſee her; he knew the Town was ſo full of Souldiers, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Houſe had ſome of them in it, he thought hers quartered ſome Officers, and enquiring out who they were, he told <hi>Celadon</hi> that he would go and ſee them at their Lodgings:</p>
               <p>That Evening they went together to the Houſe, and a Maid ſhewing them into the Parlour, they found there <hi>Marinda</hi> and two Strangers, one of which the Prince knew to be the ſame he had ſeen at the Well with her; they would have left the Room when they ſaw the Prince come in, but he was too well skill'd in War to let a weak E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy retreat, he had not ſought her out to let her go ſo eaſily; he was thinking of ſome ſhift to put off the Officers, whom the Maid was gone to call, when to his
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44408:34"/>
great ſatisfaction ſhe brought him word, they were not at home:</p>
               <p>He ſaid, that having ſo pleaſing Company, he could very well ſtay till they came in, and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down, he made a ſign to <hi>Celadon</hi> to entertain the Strangers, to give him the greater freedom with <hi>Marinda,</hi> and that he had not long, for the Mother came in:</p>
               <p>Then ſhe (as old Women uſually do) took up moſt of the talk her ſelf, till the Prince, tired with it, took his leave:</p>
               <p>As they walked home, <hi>Celadon</hi> asked the Prince what he thought of <hi>Marinda.</hi> I take her, <hi>(ſaid the Prince)</hi> to be the moſt perfect Innocence that ever was ſince the fall of <hi>Eve:</hi> Her words are ſo Witty, and yet ſo modeſt, her humour ſo nicely Vertuous, and yet ſo Civil, that I account the Country Ignorance which is in her, to be beyond all the breeding in the World. I told her that I made an advantagious exchange in getting her Company, by their not being within whom I came to ſee; ſhe ſaid, ſhe was not of the ſame opinion, ſince if Men in general were as good Company as I, ſhe muſt needs blame the unkindneſs of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which had made her of ſo unſociable a Sex, that ſhe was neither Wit enough to converſe with Men, nor would the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44408:34"/>
Rules of Vertue give a Maid that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if ſhe were otherwiſe qualified for it:</p>
               <p>I told her that all who knew her but ſo much as I did, muſt needs contradict her, in that Nature had given her Wit as well as Beauty; that the one was made to delight the Ears of Men, the other their Eyes; and as without always clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetting her ſelf up, ſhe could not bar us from the laſt, ſo neither, without great injuſtice, could ſhe deprive us of the one half of our happineſs, by tying her ſelf up to an obſtinate ſilence, meerly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of the other. She ſmiled, and ſaid, ſhe had not power enough over her ſelf, to obſerve that ſilence which a Maid ought; but that ſince Men, by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating diſcourſe, drew words from her which ſhe ſhould keep in, ſhe would ſhun the Company of that deluding Sex, and ſo keep her ſelf from yielding ſo much to them, by not coming within reach of the temptation:</p>
               <p>She bluſhed as ſhe ſpoke theſe words, and I might have gained ground mightily on her yielding heart, if the old Gentlewoman had not unfortunately come in to her reſcue. The prince pleaſed himſelf much with the thoughts of his Conqueſt, but he knew not what a ſtubborn Enemy Vertue
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44408:35"/>
is, and how difficult it would be for him to take any advantage over a Heart, which that maintain'd againſt him. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found ſo little reſiſtance at his firſt viſit, he believed <hi>Celadon</hi>'s obſervation was true, that two or three more would win her; he went often, under pretence of ſeeing the Officers, and ſometimes met with them, but never with <hi>Marinda;</hi> once or twice the Servants ſaid ſhe was abroad, but the laſt time he enquired for her, they ſaid ſhe was ſick; he fancied that ſhe had ordered the Servants to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny her, and therefore judged the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt way to ſee her would be by his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Stratagem, a Ball; and that he might not be expected there, he gave out the Evening before, that he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for <hi>Dublin</hi> the next day to get Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from the King:</p>
               <p>He rode through the Town that Morning, and her Houſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the way, he called at the Door, and asked to ſpeak with one of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers that lodged there, but to the intent that ſhe might take notice where he was going:</p>
               <p>When he was out of ſight of the Town, he rode back again to his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings another way, keeping cloſe, that no body might know of his return; and when he thought the Ball was at the

higheſt, he and <hi>Celadon</hi> went there toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the place where they Danced was the ſame where the firſt Ball was, the Company almoſt the ſame, only that it wanted the Beautiful <hi>Marinda,</hi> but in wanting her it wanted all, nothing there was worthy to entertain our Prince, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he called to <hi>Celadon</hi> to go with him home; but <hi>Celadon</hi> was of another mind, he was not ſo nice in his choice, to retire himſelf from ſuch variety of good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, meerly for the abſence of one; he was very little pleaſed with the caprici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Prince's humour, and would have willingly ſtaid behind, if he had thought it would not diſoblige him:</p>
               <p>But the Prince being deſirous to go, they took leave of the Company, and were going out together, when, at the Door, they were met by a couple of Ladies in a ſtrange <hi>Spaniſh</hi> dreſs; and their Faces, after the mode of that Nation, had long Vails over them: <hi>Celadon</hi> bobb'd the Prince, and deſired him to come back to ſee what Masks thoſe were, telling him, that under them he might chance to find <hi>Marinda;</hi> the Prince was in hopes of it too, and made up to them, but found himſelf deceived; for ſpeaking to one of them in <hi>French,</hi> ſhe ſeemed not
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44408:36"/>
to underſtand him, but whiſpered to the other, and ſhe ſpoke to him in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> asking him whether he was not the Prince of <hi>S—g,</hi> Commander of the Forces now in Town? The Prince anſwer'd her that he was; but deſired her if ſhe could ſpeak any other language to do it, for he underſtood very little of that. I ſpeak, Sir, <hi>(ſaid ſhe)</hi> a little <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and if your Highneſs can underſtand me better in that, I ſhall beg the honour of a hearing from you, for I do not know but it may lye in your Highneſs power to do me a great kindneſs:</p>
               <p>What is that kindneſs, pretty Petitioner (<hi>ſaid</hi> Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don) for all your excellent counterfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (Madam) I fancy you are two of this Town, that pretend ſome ſober buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with us now, and deſign to laugh at us when ye are gone, for being ſo little curious, as to ſee nothing of a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy but her dreſs. That you may not think (<hi>ſaid the other Lady in broken</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh) that we are not of this Countrey, we'll dance you a Sarabrand after the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> way, and if that will not convince you, I can ſhew you ſo ugly a Face, that mine ſhall be the laſt Veil you ſhall ever deſire to look under:</p>
               <p>Let us have the Dance (<hi>ſaid</hi> Celadon) and if your Air
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44408:36"/>
and Meen be as becoming as your Shape, I ſhall venture to look in your Faces, for all your threatning. The Company left off Dancing to look at theſe two, whoſe dreſs ſeem'd ſo extraordinary, and the Prince, who had a mind to ſee them Dance, ordered the Muſick to play ſuch a Tune as pleaſed them beſt, and they with their Caſtinets acquitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves very gracefully, and came off with the commendation of all the Company:</p>
               <p>Their Shapes and Carriage being very near alike, <hi>Celadon</hi> did not know which to like beſt of them; he told them that now he muſt deſire to ſee their Faces, that the handſomeſt might take him all to her ſelf, and free him from the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Captivity he now lay under, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Slave to them both; but one of them told him they could not grant it, for ſhe had a boon to the Prince, in the begging of which ſhe muſt open ſuch private paſſages of her Life, as would make her aſhamed to be ſeen by the Man that knew them; but if it e're lay in the Prince's power to grant her it, then ſhe would turn <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woman, and throw off her Veil. The Prince ſaid that was a very plauſible excuſe, and deſired <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon</hi> to urge the Strangers no more,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44408:37"/>
and turning to them, told them, that whomſoever that Story concerned, he deſired ſhe would tell him, and he would, according to her directions, ſerve her to the utmoſt of his power. Both the Strangers gave him a very low Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, in token of their thankfulneſs; and one of them deſiring the patience of his Highneſs, and the reſt of the Company, ſeating her ſelf in the midſt of them who had left their dancing to liſten to her, ſhe began thus,</p>

               <p>PErhaps this Company, and more particularly that part of it which is of my own Sex, may cenſure this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in me, and think it too much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penneſs in a Maid, to diſcover things of ſuch privacy in a publick audience, which the reſt of Woman-kind make their Cloſet-ſecrets; but my <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miſtreſs, upon this very occaſion, told me a Story of a <hi>Spartan</hi> Boy, who having ſtolen a young Fox, and hidden him under his Gown, rather than be diſcovered, kept him there till he tore out his Bowels:</p>
               <p>So it is with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ladies, if once
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44408:37"/>
Love enters into their Breaſts, though, like that Fox, it prey upon their Hearts, yet out of Modeſty they keep it ſecret; and though the cloſer it is hid, it gnaws the fiercer, yet, like the poor proud Boy, they hug it to 'em, and conceal it till it ruins them:</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and thoſe of my Country, who are in a hotter Clime, tye not themſelves up to ſuch cold, ſuch rigid Rules of Honour:</p>
               <p>Your Love, like your Winter Sun, is ſo clouded, that thoſe he ſhould ſhine on are never the better for him; ours is ſo hot and predominant, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can cover him:</p>
               <p>Now you your ſelves cannot give a good reaſon for this nice piece of Modeſty, which allows you to take a fancy to a fine Dog, a fine Horſe, or any thing elſe that is handſome, only Man, which is the ſtatelieſt, gayeſt Creature of all, you muſt not own a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for:</p>
               <p>Sure this Tyrannical cuſtom was founded at firſt by ſome old decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Matrons, that were paſt the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Love themſelves; for Nature, that has allowed you the publick free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of all other pleaſures of life, would never conſent to diſgrace this ſweeteſt of all:</p>
               <p>Whence comes it then, that tho' moſt of you are fond of it, yet you ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44408:38"/>
it ſo ſecretly, as if it were Treaſon to our Sex to own it? While I am in <hi>England</hi> I ſhould diſſemble, like the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh; but pardon me for once, if I break this general rule, in ſearching for a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, whom I can never find, but by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering my ſelf wherever I come, that ſome of thoſe who hear me, may chance to bring the ſame ſtory to his Ears, that ſo he may find me again. My Name is <hi>Faniaca,</hi> my Father was a <hi>Brachman,</hi> an <hi>Indian</hi> Prieſt in the Province of <hi>Antis,</hi> which Countrey having never been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by the <hi>Incas,</hi> kept up the ancient Barbarity, not being Civilized by their Laws, as thoſe Nations were, who had yielded to their Government:</p>
               <p>And whereas they with one conſent worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Sun, we of <hi>Antis</hi> had ſeveral Deities, the two chief of which were the Tyger, and a large Serpent, which we called <hi>Amaru:</hi> To theſe it was our cuſtom to ſacrifice Human Blood; they commonly fed on nothing elſe but Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and if we had no Captives, we were forced to find them the ſame ſort of Food from among our ſelves:</p>
               <p>But we rarely found any ſuch want, for there being an irreconcileable Enmity, firſt between us and the <hi>Incas,</hi> and then
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44408:38"/>
with thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> who took part with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> we had ſo frequent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, they to extend their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and we to defend our own, that ſcarce a day happened, but brought us in ſome new Priſoners; for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had a great Colony at <hi>Cozco,</hi> and from thence they every now and then ſent Parties far into our Countrey to take Booties, and make diſcoveries of the Land, in order to a farther Conqueſt:</p>
               <p>Theſe Parties were commonly made up of <hi>Indians,</hi> with <hi>Spaniards</hi> to head them, becauſe they would willingly ſpare their own Nation, and Conquer ours at the Natives expence. Theſe <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſtill encroached farther on us, till they had driven us over the <hi>Madalena,</hi> that great River, being very deep, of a ſtrong ſwift Current, and at that place about a League broad, made it ſeem as if our differences were now at an end, Nature it ſelf having divided us:</p>
               <p>On each ſide of the River there was a conſiderable Town, of which, the one was poſſeſſed by their Party, the other by ours; and though ſometimes our Fiſhermen would meet by chance and kill, or take one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet we never gave one another a troubleſome viſit on ſhore, by reaſon that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44408:39"/>
our Canoes were not big enough to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Men in ſo great numbers, as to dare to Land; and it being about 300 Leagues down the Sea, we never had ſeen, or could imagine any which ſhould hold above ten or twelve men at moſt; for our Canoes were made all of a piece, and how to put different Planks toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as Ship-Carpenters do, was an Art wholly unknown to us:</p>
               <p>Some of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had taught our Enemies this, and they privately built a great many large Flat-bottoms, which the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their Town fill'd with <hi>Indians,</hi> and ſent a few of his own Countrey-men with them; theſe Forces he ſent over about Mid-night, with orders to Land at our Town, kill all the Men, and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back the Boats, to keep the Town till he Landed an Army ſufficient to fight his way farther into the Country. In this Town my Father lived, and was Prieſt to the Tiger and an <hi>Amanu,</hi> which were accounted the largeſt of any there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, and therefore were worſhipped the moſt, and had their Adorers to bring them preſents from all parts. Thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> who took the <hi>Spaniards</hi> part, were always very inveterate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, becauſe the <hi>Incas</hi> made both
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44408:39"/>
their Government and Religion diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from ours; as ſoon therefore as they entered the Town they kill'd all, without any diſtinction either of Sex or Age; I was awakened out of my ſleep with a dreadful cry, ſuch as you may imagine that of a taken City to be, where their Enemies are ſo unmerciful:</p>
               <p>I ſtreight leapt off my Quilt, and ran into my Father's Room, for when by the cry I knew our Enemies to be entered, I expected to loſe my Life, and therefore choſe to lay it down by him who gave it me:</p>
               <p>I found him in a great Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and hanging about his Neck, I expected the coming of our Enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The firſt who entered the Room was a <hi>Spaniard;</hi> for though I had never ſeen one before, I knew him to be one by his Dreſs, and a Helmet which he had on as ſoon as he entered, I left my Father, and fell at his Feet to beg both our Lives; and while I was in that poſture, he bade his Souldiers ſtay back; but one of them cryed out, <hi>This is the Cupay,</hi> (that is the Devil, or Conjurer) and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing before the reſt, ran at my Father with his Spear; the Commander imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately broke out of my Arms, which were claſped about his Knees, and, draw<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44408:40"/>
a Piſtol from under his Girdle, ſhot the <hi>Indian</hi> dead; and pulling out the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he turned about to his Men, and ſwore that the firſt who diſobeyed his Orders, as that Dog had done, he'd teach him what was the Diſcipline of a Souldier:</p>
               <p>While they ſtood all ſilent, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed at the ſpeedy Juſtice he had done on their Country-man, he came to me, who was lying on the Ground bemoaning my Father, whoſe Blood ſtained the Floor, he raiſed me from the Ground, and clapping a Guard of Souldiers on me, (with orders to keep us two from receiving any violence, upon pain of their Lives) he went away, I ſuppoſe, to help his Part'ners to take the other parts of the Town:</p>
               <p>Within an hour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he came back, and pulling a Box out of his Pocket, he took a Plaiſter out of it, and put it on my Father's wound, and bad me fear nothing; aſſuring me, that he did not come to deſtroy us, but to reduce us to a better Government; and as for me, he told me, that if I pleaſed, he would make me ſo happy, that I need not fear any danger, either of Poverty, or Captivity, from the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of my condition:</p>
               <p>This, and the approach of day-light, did ſomewhat
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44408:40"/>
comfort me; my Father came to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (for loſs of blood had made him ſwoon) and began in the kindeſt words he could, to give thanks to the preſerver of his Life, who was hugging and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting me, when of a ſudden we heard the ſame confuſed noiſe in the Streets, which we heard in the Night:</p>
               <p>I thought our Enemies were finiſhing their Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon their Captives, and could not forbear burſting into Tears at their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries:</p>
               <p>The ſtrange Commander endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to comfort me all that he could, ſaying, That he could not help what the other Captains did to their Priſoners, but his own, and particularly my Father and I, ſhould have no violence offered us:</p>
               <p>The noiſe grew louder and louder, as it drew nearer, when looking out of the Window, we perceived the <hi>Antian</hi> party driving the <hi>Peruvians</hi> before them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could reſolve what to do, they were killing his own Souldiers at the Door; he with a great deal of Courage leaped forward, and after all his men were kill'd defended the Door alone; and with his Spear laid the boldeſt of them dead at his Feet:</p>
               <p>You will, perhaps, think that I was glad of this change of my Condition, to ſee my ſelf unexpectedly freed, and my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44408:41"/>
revenged of their Enemies; but I'll aſſure you I was not; the danger which my generous Defender was in, weighed down all the Joy of the other, and though my fear made me for a while ſtand, as far as I could from the Weapons; yet, at laſt my deſire to ſave him, overcame my Cowardiſe, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the door, I placed my ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and the Spears, which were bent againſt him; and cryed to my Father to ſpeak to them to let him alone, my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was ſo weak with the loſs of Blood, that he could not come to the Door, but called to them with all the entreating words he could think on; moſt of them knew my Father and me, and having a great Veneration for us (as all our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has for their Prieſts) they gave over aſſaulting him:</p>
               <p>Only the foremoſt of them asked me, why I would defend one who was the Enemy both of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Religion; I told them 'twas to him, that both their Prieſt and I owed our ſafety; that he kill'd the Man who hurt my Father, and with a great deal of care dreſſed his Wound; I deſired therefore that, for our ſakes, they would give me his Life:</p>
               <p>Theſe words per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded them to leave him to me; as ſoon
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44408:41"/>
as they were gone, I went out to ſee how things went, and brought him word, that a great Party from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, was come to our aſſiſtance, and that all who ſet foot on our Land were killed: <q rend="inline italic">And, Madam <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> ſhall I be the only man who goes home, and carries the news of ſo great a defeat?

                  <q rend="inline italic">Not of one <hi>Indian (ſaid I)</hi> for you were over-powered by numbers:</q>

               <p>When Night came, I was as good as my word; and calling two truſty Men, I ordered them to row the Stranger over the River, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them that his preſence would be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſecure them from the danger of their Enemies:</p>
               <p>At our parting he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed

himſelf very thankful to me for my generous uſage of him, and told me, that e're long he would make me a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, in the mean he deſired me to wear that about my Neck, pulling a Gold Medal, with a Chain of the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal:</p>
               <p>I, who had heard of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, gave him a large Golden Wedge, and deſiring him never to be my Country's Enemy, or put himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the like danger) I took my leave, and left him to his Fortune, the Men came back before morning, and brought me word that they had ſet him ſafe on ſhore, and that all the other ſide of the River was covered with Men:</p>
               <p>This news, which they told about the Town, alarm'd us, and that Party which came down from the Mountains to our aſſiſtance, waited to receive them; ſome of our Scouts, who rowed as near the other ſide as they durſt, brought us word that they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Canoes fill'd with Men, which made us think they deſign'd to Land by force, where the others had by Night; but this was but to amuſe and draw our Men that way; for they had provided a great number of Planks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 20 mile higher, and having light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a place where the River ran be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44408:42"/>
two Hills, and therefore could not extend it ſelf a quarter of a Mile, they made a floating Bridge, and on that they paſſed over ſome Men, before ours knew any thing of it; they took ſuch care to ſurprize the Natives, that no one came to bring us Intelligence of their being Landed, till ſome of the Planks which came floating down the River, made us ſuſpect ſomething; we ſent ſome Scouts up the River, to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver what was the matter, and they brought word that the Enmy was on this ſide of the River:</p>
               <p>Ours marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them as faſt as they could to fight them, before any more came over, and having joyned Battel, the firſt news we heard, was of a great Victory, we had gained over them; and a great many Priſoners brought us, as the proof of its being true:</p>
               <p>The <hi>Indian</hi> Priſoners were kept up to feed our Gods; but ſome few <hi>Spaniards</hi> that were taken, as being the Nobler Captives, were to be feaſted on; as it was our Cuſtom to tye our choice Priſoners to a Tree, and a great Fire being made juſt by, the Prieſt was to cut off Slices from the more fleſhy parts of them, and diſtribute them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to the People to broil and eat:</p>
               <p>If
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44408:43"/>
the Captive ſhewed any ſigns of pain, or groaned at his Sufferings, we counted him of a baſe Spirit; and after burning his Body, we ſcattered his Aſhes in the Wind; but if he endured bravely to ſee his Fleſh eaten, we dryed the Sinews and Bones, and hanging them upon the Mountains, we deify'd them, and went Pilgrimages to them. There were ten <hi>Spaniards</hi> brought to my Father, and two or 300 <hi>Indians,</hi> who were all tyed, and ſecured by a Guard ſet over them; the <hi>Indians</hi> to be a Prey to the Bellies of our Gods, and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to thoſe of our Souldiers:</p>
               <p>As ſoon as they were brought in, my Curioſity prompted me to ſee them, but very little to my ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; for the firſt I ſet my Eyes on was he whom I had ſet at liberty before:</p>
               <p>I was both concerned and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to ſee him there, and uncertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhould do any thing in his favour or no; therefore I pretended not to know him; till he making as low a bow as his being tyed would permit, asked me, did I not know him whoſe Life I had ſaved? <q rend="margQuotes">Are you he, <hi>ſaid I,</hi> whom I ſet free but a few days ago?

               <p>I went thence with a great opinion of their Courage, and a ſecret horrour in my ſelf at the cruelty of our Nation, which gave brave Men ſuch barbarous uſage:</p>
               <p>I called to mind his profeſſing a deſign to ſave me, and carry me to a happier place; and his telling me of the thing about my Neck, for a Token to know me by, made me believe it was true; and when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of this, I imagined I ought to ſave his Life, but I could not tell how to do it without my Father's conſent:</p>

               <p>I ſhewed my ſorrow in all the extravagancies which our Nation commits on the like occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but my Father only gave a groan or two, as it were to rouze up his anger, and ſaid, that he would comfort himſelf for his Son, in revenging his Death, ſince all his grief could never raiſe him to Life again:</p>
               <p>That all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who were in the Battel were killed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ten who were in his Cuſtody, and he would ſacrifice each of them, becauſe he would be ſure that his Sons Murderer ſhould not eſcape; for ſince he was killed with a Bullet, he did not doubt but it was a <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſhot him. We lay all that Night awake grieving for my Brother, but the next day, when the firſt Fury of our grief was over, and my Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to talk with me about our Priſoners: <q rend="margQuotes">Suppoſe, Father, <hi>(ſaid I)</hi> the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> who ſaved our Lives ſhould be one of them?</q>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">If that ſhould come to paſs, <hi>(ſaid my Father)</hi> he had better ſtaid where he was, than come over to ſeek his Death here the ſecond time:</q>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">But, Sir, <hi>(ſaid I)</hi> gratitude would oblige
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44408:45"/>
us to ſave his Life, who ſaved ours firſt:</q>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">That we have done already <hi>(ſaid my Father)</hi> and ſo we have returned his kindneſs; and if after ſo hard an eſcape he ſhould be come again, he does not deſerve his Life, neither would I be guilty of ſo much injuſtice to my Son and my Countrey, as to ſave that Man's Life, who has been the Death of the one, and has made a ſecond attempt to be the Deſtruction of the other.</q> This arguing of my Fathers ſeemed ſo reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and his Indignation ſo juſt, that I could not gainſay it, and therefore ſaid no more to him, but went back to my Priſoner, and told him, that I did intend to ſave him, and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions for his ſake; but that my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Body being found ſhot, had ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed my Father, that I could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with him to ſpare them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I told them they muſt prepare their Courage to dye, as ſoon as my Father's Wounds would ſuffer him to aſſiſt at the Solemnity. <q rend="margQuotes">
                     <p>Well, <hi>(ſays he)</hi> ſince I muſt dye, and it does not lye in your power to help it, I am ſorry you told me you attempted it, for that ſhews ſo much kindneſs, that it makes me deſirous to live:</p>
                     <p>I was willing to dye when you
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44408:45"/>
upbraided me with the begging my life, but now I can no longer be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to flatter you out of any ſuch hopes, ſince you ſay it is not in your power to help me; I own that my Death is no grievance to me, only as it prevents my living for you; and all that I'll now deſire of you, is to let me dye the firſt, that I may not behold the Cruelties exerciſed on my Country-men.</p>
                  </q> The Love and Courage which I perceived in theſe words, quite altered the thoughts I had, of giving him up to my Father's reſentments; and from that time I found ſomething within me ſo ſtrong on his ſide, that it over-ballanced the Duty I ſhould have paid to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's will, and my Brother's Blood:</p>
               <p>I went to my Father, and told him that he who ſaved his Life was there, and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to him how ingrateful we ſhould be, if we did not reſtore him to his Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but my Father anſwered me with the ſame Arguments he had done before:</p>
               <p>Then I endeavoured to corrupt him that was Captain of the Guard that looked to them, but he was a Blood-thirſty vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent natured Man, and not only refuſed me, but complained to my Father, who was ſo angry, that I ſhould endeavour to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:44408:46"/>
releaſe ſo many of our worſt, our moſt formidable Enemies, the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that he threaten'd, the next time I attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the like, he would have me condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſuffer with them, as the Enemy of my Country. I knew his violent temper too well to venture any farther, and gave over all hopes of ſaving my Priſoner:</p>
               <p>The next morning four <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were to be carried to our Gods to feed upon, they drew Lots for their Lives, they were blind-folded when they drew, and I held the Ciſtern, and decided who the Lot fell upon, and it often grieved me to doom the poor trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Slaves; my Priſoner ſeeing me picking out ſome of them for Death, told me, he longed to know when his turn would come; I told him that his muſt come as well as the reſt; that I had incurred my Father's diſpleaſure on his account, and left nothing undone which I thought might be for his ſafety, that I hoped this was all he could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and deſired him to own before his Death that I was out of his debt; yet I had reſolved with my ſelf to keep him till the laſt, in hopes that before that time the Guards might be changed, or elſe my Father's anger might be mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:44408:46"/>
when moſt of them had been ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to it:</p>
               <p>Two or three days had now paſt over, in which time my Father had given the Guards particular charge to beware of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for fear I ſhould free them; the day come that he found himſelf well enough to perform the Sacrifice, and our <hi>Spaniards</hi> were brought out in the midſt of their Guards, to draw Lots which of them ſhould make our Banquet; by ill chance it fell on my Priſoner; I changed the Lot, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced one of the others in his ſtead, but not ſo cleverly but that my Father per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it:</p>
               <p>The poor wretch was cut to pieces ſlice after ſlice, and lived long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſee his own Fleſh broiled, and eaten by the Company; you muſt think this was a terrible ſight to the reſt, who ſaw by their Companion what they were to ſuffer. I expected to keep him the ſame way I had the firſt day, and went on the morrow with the ſame deſign, little dreaming what would happen; for my Father, who had ſeen me play the Jugler the day before, would hold the Pitcher himſelf, and the firſt black Lot was again drawn by my Priſoner:</p>
               <p>Upon that the Fire was made to broil his Fleſh, he was ſtript naked, and tyed
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44408:47"/>
to the Tree; he looked about him, without as much as changing Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance at his Deſtiny; but when he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Eyes towards me he bluſhed, I believe out of ſhame, to think that I ſhould ſee him in that helpleſs conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</p>
               <p>Such a ſight as this, which would have drawn pity even from a merciful Enemy; what effect then do you think it had upon one that loved him? Or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what effect had it not? I bluſht and grew pale, Anger, Love, and Fear, ſucceeded one another; Anger at the Barbarity of my Countrey-men, Love for him, and Fear at his danger:</p>
               <p>But juſt as my Father's Knife fetched Blood from the brawny part of his Arm (the place which he firſt began with) I was not able to bear up any longer, but fell in a ſwoon; which my Father percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, left him, and catched me in his Arms; but not having yet recovered ſtrength enough to bear me up, he fell to the Ground with me, and lighting upon his Wound, rubbed the Plaiſters off, and made it bleed afreſh:</p>
               <p>My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was immediately taken up on ſome of their Shoulders, and carried home, and every one ſaid 'twas an unlucky day, and the Gods were angry, ſo the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44408:47"/>
was deferred till the next. When I came to my ſelf, I was very glad to ſee the poor Man delivered from imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate death, though it coſt ſome of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's blood, but it almoſt diſtracted me, to think what a ſhort reprieve I had for him, only till the next day; his Fate was now at its Criſis, and within twenty four hours I muſt either ſee him free, or mangled to pieces; all my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer hopes lay in deferring the time till another Guard came, which perhaps I could have bribed off, or till my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's mind was altered; but his Anger continued ſtill; and becauſe he found the Captain of the Guard as violent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as himſelf, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him to continue in the ſame Poſt, till all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were Sacrificed:</p>
               <p>My poor Priſoner's Lot was come, and he to dye the next day, and I had not yet thought on any way that could prevent it:</p>
               <p>After having wracked my Invention a great while, for a way to free him, at laſt I lighted on this:</p>
               <p>There were two of my Father's Servants, whom I ſent formerly to row my Priſoner over the River; I knew they wiſhed well to him, becauſe when he enter'd our Houſe as an Enemy, he had ſaved their Lives; theſe
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44408:48"/>
two I acquainted with my deſign to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe him:</p>
               <p>I gave them a large Pot full of pleaſant Liquor, made of our Sacred Plant the <hi>Coca,</hi> and bade them towards Night to bring that to the Guard-houſe, as a preſent from my Father:</p>
               <p>Our Guard conſiſted of a hundred Men, for the preſervation of the Temple, and the Treaſures of it, and the Priſoners who belonged to it; ſo that all theſe things might well require the care of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Men:</p>
               <p>We had near twice the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Indian</hi> Priſoners, beſides the nine <hi>Spaniards,</hi> only they were Armed, theſe were naked and tied:</p>
               <p>Out of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple I had got Arms enough for them all, and conveyed them into a Room hard by, to be ready upon occaſion; when the two Servants came with the Liquor, all the Souldiers crowded into the Guard-houſe, only two who ſtood to their Arms at the Priſon Door; when the Servants ſaw them all engaged about the drink, they left the Guard, and came to give me notice; upon which I took ſome Daggers (which our Souldiers had taken from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and hung up in the Temple as Trophies) theſe I hid under my Gown, (for the Women of our Nation had thin ſilk Gowns to wear
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44408:48"/>
in the cool of the Night) and ſo under pretence of ſeeing the Priſoners, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed theſe unto them:</p>
               <p>When I came in I ſaw my Priſoner aſleep, I cut the Cords of his Hands and Legs, and as I cut them he awaked and found himſelf looſe; thence I went to another, and ſtill as I looſened them I put a Dagger in their Hands:</p>
               <p>I told them I was come to give them all Liberty, if they would ſhew themſelves Men, and Conquer an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my whom they would find ſurprized, and not ready to oppoſe them. <q rend="inline italic">And my <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolfo (ſaid I)</hi> I have done all this for your ſake, yet I will rather ſtay behind you, and undergo all the puniſhments that an angry Father, or incenſed Town could inflict upon me, than fly with you, unleſs you are as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive me, as I to go.</q> Several of the <hi>Indians</hi> wept for Joy, and the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> for all their Gravity, could ſcarce forbear it:</p>
               <p>My Priſoner ſaid, that he was more glad of my Love, than of the ſaving his Life, and would have told me abundance of the like nature, had he not been interrupted; for one of the Centinels, not liking my long ſtay, came to ſee what was the matter, and no ſooner came in but he was ſtabb'd by one of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> my two Servants had
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44408:49"/>
ſtood all this while at the Door, and when one of the Centinels left them to come to us, they diſpatched the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; by this time the <hi>Indians</hi> had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed one another, and I carried them to a Chamber hard by, where I had laid the Arms:</p>
               <p>Some of the Guard, hearing a noiſe, chanced to come out, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſting ſomething more than ordinary alarm'd the reſt, but they came a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the lateſt, for we had as many Armed as they; they began a very bloody Engagement, and a great many were killed on both ſides, but our num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber increaſing we over-powered them, and they fled every way for ſafety. My Priſoner had given me in charge to ſome of the <hi>Indians,</hi> who were formerly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Command, and they kept me in Rear till the Guard fled:</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Aſtolfo</hi> came to me, and deſired me to come down to the River ſide, before the Town Guards came upon us, for our noiſe had alarm'd the Town; and there were at that time five or ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men which were left with us, for fear thoſe on the other ſide the River ſhould make another Invaſion; but we were too quick for the uproar, before the Guards came we got to the River,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44408:49"/>
and there being abundance of Canoes, and the Enemy coming after us, you may gueſs we did not ſtand to Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment who ſhould take Boat firſt:</p>
               <p>The eight <hi>Spaniards, Aſtolfo,</hi> the two <hi>Indians</hi> and my ſelf, took the ſame Canoe:</p>
               <p>We put off altogether as faſt as we could, but in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time we were parted from the reſt, the night being ſo dark that we knew not which way we went, though the Wind blew ſo hard from the other ſide, that we were afraid 'twould force us on our Enemies Coaſt, to our ruin:</p>
               <p>Two of our <hi>Spaniards</hi> tugg'd againſt it as hard as they could, till one of them broke his Oar, and then we gave over ſtriving, and let the Boat go down which way the River would carry it; the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning we would have made for Shore, but having but one Oar the Wind beat us off, and carried us down all that day and the next night with the Stream. Though the firſt day we got away we were very chearful, yet now wanting Proviſions, and being driven down we knew not whither, dampt the Joy we ſhould otherwiſe have taken in our Love and Liberty:</p>
               <p>I began to reflect on my former actions, and to think this a juſt puniſhment for my undutiful leaving
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:44408:50"/>
my Father, and my Country; I began to grow faint with hunger, and he was ſo troubled to ſee me in that condition, that in the greateſt danger of his Life I never ſaw him ſhew ſo much ſorrow. The farther we Sailed the River ſtill grew wider and wider; on one ſide we could not Land, becauſe the Wind would not let us, on the other ſide we durſt not, becauſe 'twas inhabited by thoſe Nations who are mortal Enemies to the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> We were now come down a great way, and the River had turned ſo, that the Wind, which before was againſt us, now was for us; we made towards the Land with the greateſt haſte that a violent Hunger could make; as we came near the Shore we diſcovered a Boat lying under a Rock, we made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, and ſaw only one Man in it, and he was aſleep, ſo that we were upon him before he awaked; he would have reſiſted, but finding it in vain for one Man to fight with eleven, he yielded up himſelf and his Boat; in it we found ſtore of Victuals (the richeſt prize we could have wiſhed for at that time) and you may think we fell on to ſome purpoſe:</p>
               <p>We examined the Fellow, and he ſaid he belonged to a Ship which lay about
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:44408:50"/>
ſixty Leagues lower; that they ſent twenty Men up the River in queſt of a Prize which they were to take, by plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering a little Town thereabouts; he told us, that there were about ſo many more left in the Ship, but that the greateſt part of them lay ſick of the Wounds they had received in a late Engagement:</p>
               <p>We ſtept into his Boat, and going down the River, in eight days time we came within ſight of the Ship; then having got out of the Man what intelligence we thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, we threw him over-board, and made up to the ſide of the Pinnace; it being duskiſh, and they knowing their own Boat again, they miſtook us for their own Men; ſo that half the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> entered, and had killed all that were above Deck, before they miſtruſted any thing; the reſt they took Priſoners, and (throwing all the Wounded Men into the Sea) becauſe we had not Proviſions ſufficient to laſt us all, they ſet their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners on Shore, and ſo came down the River merrily in a Ship of our own:</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> fell to ſearching, and found ſome Bullion in her, beſides a vaſt deal of ready money, which, after a juſt diviſion between us ten, we computed
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44408:51"/>
would amount to near 30000 Ducats a piece, ſo that with a general conſent we Sail'd ſtreight for <hi>Spain,</hi> intending to Land at the firſt Port of that Kingdom which we came to. Now we were happy enough, we had eſcaped our Enemies the <hi>Indians,</hi> and Famine, which had like to have proved a more fatal Enemy than they; beſides the Prize which enriched us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our expectation, and came in good time to help my needy Fortune, who in that hurry of leaving home, had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered to bring any thing of value with me, beſides a few Pearl which I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways wore about me. My Servant came and took me in his Arms, congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my eſcape out of the ſeveral dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers we had been in, and thanking me a thouſand times for the kindneſs I had ſhewed in ſaving his Life; and more for leaving a Father, to run the ſame For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune with him:</p>
               <p>In fine, he promiſed that he would requite all my kindneſſes, by having me Chriſtened, and marrying me as ſoon as we came to <hi>Spain:</hi> And I was ſo well pleaſed with the alteration of my Condition ſo much for the better, that I think that Night was one of the pleaſanteſt of my Life. The next Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning we ſpy'd a Sail making up to us, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44408:51"/>
as ſoon as it came within reach, it ſent a great Shot to command us to ſtrike Sail; we ſaw by the bulk that it was a Man of War, too ſtrong for us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt:</p>
               <p>We, much againſt our wills, ſtaid for it, and received ſome of them on board; in ſearching our Ship they found divers Colours, as Pyrats uſually have; our Veſſel, it ſeems, had been one, and for their Faults who had owned her, we were all ſeiz'd, our Veſſel made a Prize, and our Men taken Priſoners:</p>
               <p>The Man of War being a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> the Captain ſaid he would reſerve <hi>Aſtolfo</hi> and his eight Country-men to be tryed on Shore, and condemned to the Gallies:</p>
               <p>My two <hi>Indians</hi> (notwithſtanding all my intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for their Lives) he hanged on the Ropes before my Face:</p>
               <p>But taking com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on me, he ſaid he would keep me to wait on his Wife:</p>
               <p>Accordingly, when we came upon the Coaſts of <hi>Spain,</hi> he ſent the nine <hi>Spaniards</hi> Priſoners to <hi>Sevil;</hi> and though I begg'd him to let me accompany <hi>Aſtolfo,</hi> he kept me at Sea a few days more, and then Landed me at <hi>Aveiro,</hi> and gave me a preſent to a Wife he had there. It would be tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for me to tell you, how ill I bore this worſt change of my Fortune; I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:44408:52"/>
I grieved, till my Sighs and Tears grew ſo thick upon one another, that no one could know which was the moſt plentiful of their two Fountains, my Heart, or my Eyes. My Miſtreſs, who was a good natur'd Gentlewoman, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed her ſelf in my Sorrows, and would often enquire what was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of my grieving; till at laſt her Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities drew from me the whole Relation, which I have now made to you; ſhe bade me be comforted, and think no more of him; I told her I could not be ſatisfied without him: <q rend="inline italic">That opinion <hi>(ſays ſhe)</hi> is, I hope, a falſe one; you muſt be comforted either without him, or not at all, for you muſt never expect to ſee him again; for ſuppoſing he ſhould eſcape, being condemned to the Gallies, yet how is it likely that you, who are a Stranger, ſhould find out a ſingle Man, and one of no note, in ſuch a large City as <hi>Sevill,</hi> or one who perhaps, before you could get thither, would be gone to ſome other part of the World?</q> I told her I had an Art, by which I could do more than that; and thus much I knew, that if I were at my liberty, and had a little travelling Money, I ſhould not be a year e're I found him She asked what Art that was: <q rend="inline italic">'Tis what I learned
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:44408:52"/>
from my Father, <hi>(ſaid I)</hi> and is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among us:</q> She deſired to ſee the effects of it; I told her I would ſhew it, in reſolving whatever queſtion ſhe would ask me. She bade me tell her where her Husband was at that time, and when he would come home:</p>
               <p>I told her ſhe muſt buy me a ſmall Drum, which had never been uſed before, and I would then tell her that queſtion, and any other. When ſhe heard me affirm it ſo confidently, ſhe ſaid ſhe would try me, and bought me a Drum:</p>
               <p>I that Night uſed ſome Charms over it, which my Father and I had pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed on ſuch occaſions; and the next morning I told her my Maſter would be at home on the morrow: <q rend="inline italic">I thought <hi>(ſays ſhe (laughing)</hi> how you could foretell: Why your Maſter is gone into the <hi>Straights</hi> a crui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and bade me not expect him theſe two Months.</q> I let her enjoy her increduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but ſhe had like to have ſuffered by it; for ſhe, good Woman, conſidering that her Captain made long ſtays and ſhort returns, had providently looked out for a Gallant, to comfort her in his abſence; but I was yet too much a Stranger to be made acquainted with ſuch privacies. She had an old <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Maid, who was the only Servant ſhe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44408:53"/>
kept, till I came; this Maid was privy to all her Intrigues. They had at that time pitched upon a young Gentleman, who had an Eſtate near the City, he was very fond of my Miſtreſs, as Men uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally are of every new Conqueſt, and had invited her to ſpend a few days, in her Husband's abſence, at his Countrey Seat:</p>
               <p>She conſented to go with him, and they had aſſigned a day to go together, and as it happened, 'twas the very day after that on which my Maſter was to come home; but it drawing towards Night, and my Miſtreſs hearing no news of him, nor ſeeing any likelihood of his coming, ſhe ſent her Maid to invite the Gallant to Sup with her; me ſhe ſent up to Bed, pretending that ſhe had ſome buſineſs for me to riſe very early the next morning:</p>
               <p>I lay in the Room over her, and though I went to Bed without the ſuſpition of any ſuch treachery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my Maſter, yet chance diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it all to me:</p>
               <p>I awakened after I thought I had been a pretty while aſleep, I fancied I heard a Man's voice in my Miſtreſſes Chamber, and concluded it was my Maſter's, becauſe I thought my Art would not deceive me; however, my curioſity prompted me to a deſire of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44408:53"/>
knowing whether it was he or no:</p>
               <p>I got out of Bed ſoftly, and looking down, I ſaw her ſitting at Table, with three diſhes of Meat before her; (which in hungry <hi>Spain</hi> is a noble Treat) by her there was ſeated a fine young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he whom I juſt now deſcribed to you; their diſcourſe, at that inſtant, happened to be of me. She told him ſhe had a Slave who pretended to foretell future events; that ſhe had told her that the Captain would be at home that day; the Gentleman laughed, as he ſaid, to think that a Slave ſhould be ſo bold, to impoſe ſuch a Story on her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs; he laughed at her too, for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any belief to me; and I laughed at them both, to think how ſecure they fancied they were from my Eyes and my Maſters, and yet how much they were miſtaken. While I was peeping down, and liſtening to their diſcourſe, we heard a loud knocking at the Door; my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs cry'd out immediately that it was the Captain's knock, and that ſhe was undone, unleſs they could hide him ſomewhere in that Room; for to ſend him up to mine, was the way to let me know of it, and being a Stranger, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I might betray him to her Husband.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:44408:54"/>
The Gentleman was young and ſlender; and his Limbs; which ſeemed compoſed rather for Love than War, ſhew'd that he was a very unequal Match for a great two-handed Sea Captain:</p>
               <p>And you have all heard enough of the raging <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Jealouſie, to think, that if a young hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Man had been found there, and at ſo ſuſpitious a time, 'twould have gone near to have coſt all three of them their Lives. The Captain ſtill knocking har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and harder, made them all at their wits end what to do with him; at length they bethought themſelves of a great Cheſt, which my Maſter had given his Wife full of Plunder, when he firſt came on ſhore with me; but ſhe had taken all thoſe things out, and my Maſter had fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it with Sea Bisket, which he had bought for his Men; the Miſtreſs and Maid emptyed theſe Biskets out under the Bed, and begg'd the Gentleman to try whether he could get into the Cheſt; the young Spark was as complying as ſhe could wiſh him; he made a quick ſhift to get in, and his Fear was at that time ſo ſtrong upon him, that it would not only have driven him into that, but into a Mouſe-hole, if there had been one in the Room:</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he was in, the

Maid let in my Maſter, who ſeemed a little angry that he was kept ſo long at the door; and ſeeing the Cloath laid, and the Table covered with Meat, he asked my Miſtreſs how all that came there, and what ſhe deſigned with it? I wondered how ſhe would come off; but ſhe very readily anſwered, that ſhe provided it for him, and kept him at the Door while ſhe took it from the Fire, that he might be the more ſurprized, to find ſo good a Supper ready for him on the Table. He asked how ſhe could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it for him, ſince no Man in <hi>Aveiro</hi> knew of his coming? My Miſtreſs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that the <hi>Indian</hi> he had left with her, had told her he would certainly be at home that night. <q rend="inline italic">When did ſhe tell you this? <hi>(ſaid he)</hi>

               <p>The Sea-men kept her not long in pain, for they came while we were talking of them:</p>
               <p>My Maſter mentioned nothing of the Bisket
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:44408:57"/>
to them, but deſired, before he ſat down, that they would remove that Cheſt up one pair of Stairs for him:</p>
               <p>Two of them immediately laid hold on two Rings which were faſtened in the ſides of it, and heaved it by degrees up ſtairs, I lighting them the way; the Stairs were ſo narrow that they could not go both on a breaſt, but one pulled the Cheſt up, and the other heav'd it after him, by which means our Gallant was almoſt ſtifled in it, for his Head chanced to lie at that end which was lowermoſt; therefore, when it was near the top, he not being able to endure it any longer, ſtirred about to lye eaſier, and coughed; at which the Men, being ſtartled, let go, and the weight of the Cheſt tumbled it down that pair of Stairs, and another pair which joined juſt to it; though the Cheſt was locked, yet the tumbling of it made me expect every moment that it would ſly open; and therefore, leſt it ſhould diſcover the Gentleman, I dropt the Candle:</p>
               <p>My Miſtreſs ſhriek'd at the noiſe, and clapt too the Room Door where my Maſter was; he ſtood ſilent, not knowing what to think of the noiſe; one of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſtood by me till the Maid brought us
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:44408:57"/>
a light, but the other, who bore up the lower end of the Cheſt, was driven down all the Stairs before it:</p>
               <p>I heard the poor Man groan, and was terribly afraid that it was the Gentleman's voice, and that the fall had crippled him; I therefore deſired them all to ſtay in the Room while I went down Stairs, they were willing to obey me, for the horrid noiſe had put them in ſuch a Fright, that they ſtood gazing one at another, wondering what the event would be:</p>
               <p>When I came down, I found the Cheſt open, and the Gentleman gone; then I helped the hurt Man up Stairs; his Head was broken, and ſome parts of his Body bruiſed with the fall, but he was more afraid than hurt. <q rend="margQuotes">Well, <hi>ſaid my Miſtreſs to me,</hi> this comes of your raiſing the Devil.</q> The Seaman, who did not know what to make of it before, hearing her ſay it was the Devil, concluded it was ſo indeed; and ſaid, He was ſure 'twas a cloven Foot trod on him, for he felt it, and that he ſaw the Tail of it, as it went out of the Houſe. <q rend="margQuotes">What, then is he gone <hi>(ſaid my Miſtreſs)</hi>

Spirits, pray raiſe no more of them:</q>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">Then, Madam, <hi>(ſaid I)</hi> you muſt not give me the occaſion.</q> Now my Miſtreſs's real fear was over, her counterfeit one vaniſhed with it, and bidding us ſet Chairs, ſhe and my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſat down; the wounded Man he ſent on Ship-board to the Chyrurgeon, and having ſupped and diverted himſelf with the poor impriſoned Devil, they went to Bed, where he paſſed that night with my Miſtreſs, who would rather have had that Devil for her Bedfellow. The next morning my Miſtreſs's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour came to her; and my Maſter, who was filled with the laſt nights ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, could not contain himſelf from communicating it to the Father, ſaying, That he had given his Wife an <hi>Indian,</hi> that could raiſe Spirits, and make them tell her things that were do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at ever ſo great a diſtance; rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, withall, what had happened by that means in his Houſe the night before:</p>
               <p>The Holy Man, ſtroking up his Beard, with an auſtere look, told him, that this was no Jeſt, ſaid, it was making a compact with the Devil, and that his Chriſtianity obliged him to confeſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an Enemy to all ſuch actions; and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:44408:58"/>
therefore was bound in Conſcience to diſcover this to the Fathers of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; and deſired my Maſter to ſecure me:</p>
               <p>He ſaid this when I was by; I was earneſt to know what he meant by the Inquiſition; but when he told me the danger of coming under the clutches of that bloody Court, and named ſome of their Puniſhments, as the Wheel, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, and other ingenious Cruelties of theirs, I would have given my life for a <hi>Maravedy.</hi> When my Maſter was gone out, I fell down on my knees to my Miſtreſs, and begg'd her to give me my liberty, and put me in ſome way to eſcape this barbarous tryal, that the Prieſt would bring me to:</p>
               <p>I told her I was loath to mention the kindneſs I had done her, in conveying her Spark away, leſt that ſhould look like upbraiding her with it; but thus much I muſt ſay of it, that it was that Story which made the Prieſt ſo zealous againſt me, and that if ever I came before the Inquiſition, Self-preſervation would force the truth from me, and that I muſt confeſs the Cheat I put upon my Maſter, to avoid the imputation of Witchcraft. See an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered me very civilly, that ſhe had ſuch a ſenſe of the kindneſs I had done her,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44408:59"/>
that ſhe would requite it with giving me my freedom; and when my Maſter came home, ſhe was very urgent till ſhe prevailed with him to do the like; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe did this out of gratitude to me, or the fear of my threatning a diſcovery, I do not know; but my Maſter called me to him, and bade me go and hide my ſelf on board that night, leſt the Officers ſhould come to ſearch for me:</p>
               <p>The next day he came on board him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and asked me where I would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Land, I told him in <hi>England;</hi> for I had conſulted my Drum, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that I ſhould find my Lover in one of the Northern Iſlands, coming from the Siege of a City, and the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> juſt then Landing in <hi>England,</hi> made me think that likely to be the place:</p>
               <p>We met at Sea with an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant, and giving me a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Money, he put me on board there; I had, beſides, ſome Money my Miſtreſs gave me at parting, and a Pearl Neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, with ſome Bracelets, which my Maſter (finding ſo great a Prize with us) ſpared me, when he plundered me at Sea; theſe ſold in <hi>England</hi> for two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Duckets; with ſome of this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney I put my ſelf into an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Garb,

keeping my <hi>Spaniſh</hi> one by me, and went up to <hi>London,</hi> and hired my ſelf to a Perſon of Quality; and being an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landiſh Woman, and appearing in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gentile Dreſs, I was made her Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman; I ſtaid with her near a year, in which time I put up a little more Money, and good Cloaths, and learn'd <hi>Engliſh</hi> enough, and then I left her, to travel in queſt of my Lover:</p>
               <p>I went down to <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and hearing that there was a War in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I embarked for this Kingdom; I have been in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and am now come hither to follow the Camp, where I am aſſured I ſhall find him:</p>
               <p>I get as much as maintains me on the Road, by telling Fortunes to the Gentry, who ſometimes are very liberal to me:</p>
               <p>Amongſt the different Fates I read, thoſe belonging to Love delight me moſt, as being moſt agreeable to my own temper; and when ever it lies in my way to forward any of thoſe by my Skill, my being in their Circumſtances, makes me the readier to help them.</p>

taking their leaves of him, left him to expect the inſight the next day would give him of his Fortune. On the morrow they came again, and the Prince took the <hi>Indian</hi> into the Cloſet (as he had done the day before) and deſired her to be as plain as ſhe could, in foretelling him all that was to befall him in his Love:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>(ſaid ſhe)</hi> your Highneſs muſt acquaint me whether you deſign Marriage, or no. Marriage! <hi>(ſaid the Prince)</hi> why did not I confeſs to you, that ſhe was a private Gentlewoman, one beneath me? I wonder you ſhould ask ſuch a queſtion:</p>
               <p>Pray, Sir, be not angry, (<hi>reply'd the</hi> Indian) for how can I tell your Highneſs what ſucceſs you are like to have in any deſign, until I know the deſign it ſelf? If <hi>(anſwer'd he)</hi> I can enjoy her on any terms, but thoſe of Marriage, I ſhall think my ſelf very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; if not, my Love has ſo wholly blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, as to make me forget my Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and my Honour. Your Highneſs <hi>(ſaid ſhe)</hi> is certainly very prudent, in having ſo great a command over your Love; and pray make uſe of it, when I ſhall tell you the ſtate of your Affairs:</p>
               <p>The Lady you Love, has a Gentleman who loves her as violently as you, only
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:44408:63"/>
a more honourable way:</p>
               <p>Your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs's Fortune has altogether the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant over his, if you are inclined to lay hold of that advantage, if not, my Art tells me, that, within a Week, ſhe will be too far off for you to enjoy, or ever to ſee her again. And is this all the hopes you can give me? <hi>(ſaid the Prince)</hi> Yes, <hi>(ſaid ſhe)</hi> only thus much I may add, that your Fortune promiſes you a great deal of happineſs, if ever you have her; but if you Love, I need not tell you this, for Love injoy'd is always happy; ſince, if there be ſuch a thing as happineſs, it is to be in that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is moſt delightful to us; being in poſſeſſion of what we Love, is being in the condition which is moſt delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to us, and thence may well pretend to be the higheſt of Enjoyments. I ſee you are ſo Indulgent <hi>(ſaid the Prince)</hi> as to humour me in my Love, but that is deſtructive to me, and therefore we'll talk of it no more; there's ſomething <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> by way of gratification, for the trouble I have put you to:</p>
               <p>The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> told him, ſhe would not receive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch reward, for the unwelcome news ſhe had brought him; that all the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſhe deſired, was his Highneſs's favour
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:44408:64"/>
to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> if ever ſhe found him:</p>
               <p>Only deſired his Highneſs to take her advice, never to put himſelf to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of another attempt on his Miſtreſs, unleſs 'twas with a deſign of Marriage, for her Art declared it would prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful:</p>
               <p>That if his Highneſs ever wanted her help in this, or any other buſineſs, he might find her in this Town, where ſhe reſolved to ſtay, till the Army was marched through it to <hi>Limerick,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that was the likelieſt way to find out her Lover. With theſe words ſhe took her leave, and taking her Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with her, left the Prince in the greateſt diſtraction of thought imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</p>
               <p>The aſſurance which the <hi>Indian</hi> had given him, that he muſt expect no ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, unleſs in a Vertuous Love, made him reſolve to ſhake off the mean Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but all his endeavours were vain; the more he tryed it, the more ſenſible he grew, how unable he was to perform it:</p>
               <p>He adviſed with <hi>Celadon,</hi> and they agreed to carry on the Intrigue, in ſpight of what the <hi>Indian</hi> foretold; and this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed beſt with the Prince's humour, who, though he could not entertain the thoughts of Marrying her, could leſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the thoughts of loſing her. They
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:44408:64"/>
contrived to have it thought about Town, that <hi>Celadon</hi> had fallen into the Prince's diſpleaſure; the Prince ſhewed the firſt ſigns of it in Houſe, and they of the Houſe ſoon reported it abroad; <hi>Celadon,</hi> with a ſeeming diſcontent, left the Prince, and went to Lodge with one of the Officers, at <hi>Marinda</hi>'s Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's:</p>
               <p>There was a young Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a Couſin of <hi>Marinda</hi>'s, and her chief Confident, the ſame whom the Prince had heard talking with her at the Well, the only comfort of her Parents, who were worth above ten thouſand Ducats, of which, their Deaths would leave her the entire Poſſeſſour; ſhe was withal very Witty, and good Humou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but Nature and Fortune, who not often agree to be over-kind to the ſame perſon, had here followed their uſual Cuſtom, making her want in Beauty, what ſhe had in Riches:</p>
               <p>And as her Wit was keen, and ſharp, upon all that came into her Company, ſo Nature had given you an exact Copy of her inſide, by her out-ſide; for her Face had as much of Satyr in it, as her Tongue; the Chin of it was ſharp and long, the Noſe tucked up, as if it fled from her Mouth, which was ſo wide, as if Nature
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:44408:65"/>
had deſigned it for ſome Cormorant Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:</p>
               <p>Her Face was all over ſtudded with Freckles, which, like the Stars in the milky way, lay ſo thick, that you would have thought it one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued yellowneſs; only her Cheeks, which had a red Colour, but ſuch a tawny one, as that of blaſted Goos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries. This Gentlewoman was then in Town with <hi>Marinda</hi>'s Mother, who was her Aunt, and ſhe was an excellent help to her Couſin, both diverting her from Melancholly with her Company, and helping her with her Advice:</p>
               <p>When <hi>Celadon</hi> came to Lodge there, he became acquainted with her; and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that he once had ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with her, while the Prince was entertaining her Couſin, he call'd to mind, how Witty and Pleaſant he that time found her Converſation:</p>
               <p>Their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſame Houſe, made them often in one anothers Company, and in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time they grew to a great Familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Celadon,</hi> hearing what a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fortune ſhe had, made his Addreſſes to her in earneſt, but found her ſtill grow ſtrange, when he ſpoke to her of that, and therefore thought that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary was the cauſe of it:
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:44408:65"/>
in the mean time the Prince grew recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to <hi>Celadon,</hi> and as their falling out, was only a pretence for <hi>Celadon</hi>'s leaving him to Lodge there, ſo the Prince now made uſe of that priviledge to his own advantage; for now <hi>Marinda</hi> could no longer avoid him; and though ſhe did as often as ſhe could, yet he came ſo often thither, that ſometimes he lighted on her before ſhe was aware: <hi>Celadon</hi>'s Chamber was on the ſame floor with hers, and nothing but a ſmall Gallery divided them; her Chamber was juſt at the Stair-head, and the Prince would ſometimes, as he came up Stairs, find her Door open, and then force himſelf into her Company:</p>
               <p>He this way had frequent acceſs to her, yet could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gain from her the leaſt word in his Favour:</p>
               <p>In this poſture his Amour was, when an Expreſs came to him, that the King had ſet out of <hi>Dublin,</hi> on his March to <hi>Limerick;</hi> the Prince gave the Officers notice to have all the Souldiers in Arms the next day to receive him:</p>
               <p>He went ſtreight to ſee <hi>Marinda,</hi> becauſe he did not know but the King might take him along with him, as he came through the Town, and ſo not give him time to take his leave of her:</p>
               <p>He came into her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:44408:66"/>
and being uſed to go often thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Celadon,</hi> went up Stairs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking to any body; not ſeeing her below, he went into her Room, but not finding here there, and ſeeing her Cloſet-door open, and a Pen and Ink on the Table, he pulled the Door cloſe, and ſat down to write a <hi>Billet Deux,</hi> which he intended to leave for her:</p>
               <p>In the mean while <hi>Marinda</hi> came into the Room, and this Couſin with her, and ſitting down, they carried on a diſcourſe, the firſt words of which the Prince did not hear, but the following were to this purpoſe:</p>
               <p>I tell you, <hi>Marinda, (ſaid the Stranger)</hi> 'tis in a happy hour for you, that the King is coming down, for he will take theſe Souldiers with him, and this Prince, who is ſo ungentile to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the ruin of a Gentlewoman:</p>
               <p>I ſhould ſcarce blame him (<hi>ſaid</hi> Marinda) for why ſhould a Man be blamed for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting the way to his own happineſs? Nor am I ſo conceited, as to aim at Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; for what private Gentlewoman could nouriſh ſuch vain hopes as thoſe, of being raiſed to a Princeſs? 'Tis more than a bare Prodigy, for Earthquakes, Inundations, and thoſe wonders of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture do ſometimes happen; but that a
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:44408:66"/>
Prince ſhould marry a private Maid, is ſuch a wonder, as I never found menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in all the Chronicles I have read. What? Couſin, <hi>(ſays ſhe)</hi> and do you plead for him! will you ever conſent to his Love on diſhonourable terms? No, (<hi>ſaid</hi> Marinda) as I do his Cauſe Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, ſo I will my own; had not this news of the King's coming prevented me, I would have gone with you to your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's, to avoid him; now I will deferr it till I hear the Siege of <hi>Limerick</hi> is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, then I will retire to your Houſe, or ſome other Relations, where he ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver trouble me again, or I him. Ay, do, <hi>Marinda, (ſaid her Couſin)</hi> fly the Tempter:</p>
               <p>But what ſhall I do with my Lovers? They are both going to the Camp, and will expect that I give them ſome ſatisfactory anſwer; and I do not know which way to incline; the one is a Captain of Horſe, he is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of by my Father, but diſliked by my Mother and me, becauſe he is a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, and I have another cauſe of averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for him, that is, that he is a Foreig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; I don't fear that all his Country Jealouſie can make him ſuſpitious of ſuch a Face as mine; but thoſe on the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent make ſuch ſaucy domineering Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:44408:67"/>
that no free-born <hi>Iriſh</hi>-woman will endure their ſlavery:</p>
               <p>There is <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon</hi> a good Humoured, Handſome, Witty Fellow, and one that I like very well; he makes his Courtſhip ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly, and ſwears ſo ſeriouſly that he Loves me, that I do almoſt believe him; yet the Fellow is ſo poor, that I fancy neither Father nor Mother will ever conſent to my having him; prithee tell me what reſolution to take; or whether of the two to favour, my inclination, or my Obedience. There is (<hi>ſaid</hi> Marin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da) come to this Town an <hi>Indian,</hi> who tells Fortunes very true:</p>
               <p>Shall we <hi>(ſaid ſhe)</hi> put on our Masks, and go to her? No, (<hi>ſaid</hi> Marinda) ſhe will come to me for ſending for; I was the firſt that received her in this Town, and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com'd her as a Stranger, and therefore ſhe is very intimate with me:</p>
               <p>Then pray <hi>(ſaid the Stranger)</hi> let us ſend for her immediately: 'Tis not a fit time (<hi>ſaid</hi> Marinda) but in the Afternoon I will ſend her a Meſſage by my Maid, and ſhe ſhall bring her with her; but we are ſummoned, here's a Servant come to call us to Dinner. They went down toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Prince ſtole ſoftly to <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>'s Room, and finding him within,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:44408:67"/>
bade him come along with him to his Lodgings; and he bearing the Prince company out, no body ſuſpected, but he had all the while been in <hi>Celadon</hi>'s Chamber. As the Prince walked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Lodging, he told <hi>Celadon</hi> of his lying hid in the Cloſet, and all that he over-heard them ſaying. And now <hi>Celadon, (ſaid he)</hi> what think you of my Condition? What ſhould I think, (<hi>anſwered</hi> Celadon) but that you are happy? for you love and are beloved:</p>
               <p>But what good will that Love do me <hi>(re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd he)</hi> ſince 'twill never avail me any farther than the bare acknowledgment? Nay, that ſhe Loves me is rather my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs, for did ſhe not, perhaps ſhe would continue here, and I might have thoſe ſmaller ſatisfactions, the ſight of her, and her Converſation:</p>
               <p>And I would rather have her Company, though ſhe tortur'd me with diſdain, than loſe her by this effect of her Love. Your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (<hi>ſaid</hi> Celadon) has better Politicks in War than in Love; if in the Battel your Enemy ſhould fly, would you grieve that he did not ſtand longer, does not his flight do better? If ſhe had ſtrength enough to reſiſt ſhe'd ſtand; but ſhe, like him, in her flight confeſſes
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:44408:68"/>
her weakneſs, and in retiring before you does ſeem to ſay, <hi>Come follow me, and Conquer.</hi> Your Highneſs ſaw her Couſin, my Miſtreſs, though her Face is very ordinary, yet her Shape is handſome; ſhe has a very taking Wit, and I hear ſhe has a Bag of Money would blind one ſooner, than the moſt dazling Beauty:</p>
               <p>And (as I am a Souldier) though I have a great devoir for all the Beauties of the fairer Sex, yet, to my thinking, rich Jewels out-ſhine the brighteſt Eyes, and the yellow of the <hi>Leuidores</hi> is a more glorious colour, than the faireſt White and Red, that ever made Lover doat, or Poet Rhime:</p>
               <p>I am glad they will ſend to the <hi>Indian,</hi> for I'll tell them their Fortunes, and order them too, but ſo much to our advantage, that you ſhall have your Miſtreſs, and I mine; the way I will go about it ſhall be this:</p>
               <p>Your Highneſs may deſire your Landladies pretty Niece to take her Maid with her, and go to the <hi>Indian</hi> to know her Fortune, let her order the Maid in the mean time to ſtay at the Door, and when the Servant comes from <hi>Marinda,</hi> let her pretend to be the <hi>Indian</hi>'s Servant, and to carry the meſſage up Stairs; let her bring the Servant down word, that her Miſtreſs,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:44408:68"/>
the <hi>Indian,</hi> is buſie with Company, but will wait upon her Lady in the Evening; then let the young Gentlewoman grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the <hi>Indian</hi> well for telling her Fortune, and tell her that ſhe has a mind to have a Frollick that Night, and deſire the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> to lend her one of her <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Suits to Maſquerade in:</p>
               <p>When ſhe has brought this Suit home, I will put it on, and go to <hi>Marinda</hi>'s at the appointed time; I will perſonate the <hi>Indian,</hi> my feigned Voice is ſhrill enough to paſs for a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, you know I have got a Foreign tone, as well as ſhe, my height and ſhape are much the ſame, and for my Face 'tis no matter, ſhe always wears a Veil, ſo will I, and as to her gift of Fortune-telling, let me alone to tickle their Fancies. The Prince was mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleas'd with the Stratagem, and ſaid, <hi>Go on and proſper, thou cunning</hi> Proteus, <hi>and may</hi> Celadon <hi>the Propheteſs have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter luck than</hi> Celadon <hi>the</hi> Franciſcan. The Prince ſent up for the young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, and telling her that there was an <hi>Indian</hi> come to Town, who ſhewed none but Gentry their Fortunes, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired her to go this Afternoon to ask hers; and told her, that ſhe muſt bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Suit of the <hi>Indian,</hi> as for
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:44408:69"/>
her ſelf:</p>
               <p>He gave her a Purſe of Gold to pay the expence, and leave as a pawn for the Cloaths, in caſe the <hi>Indian,</hi> not knowing her, ſhould be unwilling to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture them without Security. The young Gentlewoman took her Maid with her, and did her buſineſs as ſucceſsfully as they could wiſh:</p>
               <p>She had her Fortune told, and the Prince, to whom former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhe made the whole Relation of her A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, was deſirous to know what the event of it would be. She told him, that the <hi>Indian,</hi> ſmiling, delivered it in theſe words; <q rend="inline italic">Be Conſtant, and be Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.</q>
                  <q rend="inline italic">Thank your kind Fortune, Madam, <hi>(ſaid the Prince)</hi> how many a Lover would be over-joy'd at ſuch a Prediction!</q> He ſpake this with a particular earneſtneſs:</p>
               <p>The Fair Virgin gave the Prince thanks, for ſending her to know it, and took her leave of him, not without obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſomething extraordinary in his Countenance, by which ſhe gueſs'd that the impartial God of Love, has no more reſpect for Perſons of Quality, than for their Inferiours. <hi>Celadon</hi> fell to ſhifting himſelf, and having put on the <hi>Indian</hi>'s Habit, looked ſo like her, that the Prince promiſed himſelf both Diverſion and Succeſs from this adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:44408:69"/>
                  <hi>Celadon</hi> ſtaid till it grew duskiſh, becauſe the Night would help the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe; about an hour after he came back again, and gave the Prince this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Succeſs. I have been at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi>'s, ſhe took me into the Cloſet (where you was) very cautiouſly, leſt any one ſhould hear but her Couſin and me, not dreaming who ſhe confeſſed her ſelf to:</p>
               <p>She told me that ſhe did Love you, and yet muſt diſſemble it; that ſhe heard your Highneſs had been in the Houſe, and ſhe thought 'twas to ſee her; that ſhe expected you would come to take your leave of her, and did not know how ſhe ought to receive you:</p>
               <p>She ſaid that I told her at firſt, that ſhe ſhould have you, but now deſired me to confeſs freely, whether I ſpoke truth then, or did it to flatter her humour; for if it were ſo, ſhe would not indulge her ſelf the ſight of you any more, but wean her ſelf from you for altogether. I found by this, that the <hi>Indian</hi> had ſoothed her up with the hopes of your Marrying her; I humoured her too, and bade her hope the beſt:</p>
               <p>For had I done contrary, that would have contradicted what the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> told her, and given her ſome grounds to ſuſpect me for a Cheat; beſides, deſpair

might have made her refrain your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany for ever:</p>
               <p>She ſighed, and ſaid, ſhe would ask my Advice, whenever ſhe had occaſion for it. Then her pert Couſin took me up, telling me much the ſame ſtory that you over-heard her in, and deſired to know which of theſe Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſhe ſhould have:</p>
               <p>Your Highneſs may imagine I gave the Verdict on my own ſide:</p>
               <p>And after threatning her with all the ill fortune, that can be in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Servant, I promiſed her as much happineſs in my ſelf; and was ſo large in my own praiſes, that it made me bluſh, under my Veil, while I uttered them. She proffered me a reward for what Advice I gave her, yet would not tell me whether ſhe would take it or no. But when I had parted with them, and thought the Joke was over, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanteſt part of it was to come; for at the Door I met a pretty young Lady, who was come to pay a viſit to <hi>Marin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da:</hi> I was at the Ball <hi>(ſays ſhe)</hi> when you profeſſed the faculty you have, in fore-telling Events, and now I have met you in a private Houſe, I muſt needs make tryal of it; ſaying this, ſhe took me aſide, and having conjured me Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, ſhe told me, that ſhe lived in <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:44408:71"/>
and was ardently ſollicited by one <hi>K—k,</hi> a great Officer in the Army; that he made her vaſt promiſes of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and everlaſting Affection; and ſhe deſired to know whether he would prove Conſtant, if ſhe truſted him:</p>
               <p>After ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving looked fixedly on her Face, and the palms of her Hands, and uſed thoſe impertinent Formalities, that your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Fortune-tellers do, I bade her never doubt it, my Life for it he would prove true. She could not conceal the Joy ſhe conceived, at my favourable anſwer; and for my good news, and to bribe me to Secrecy, ſhe clapp'd a <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> into my Hand. I hope your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will not blame me, for cozening the poor Maid, for I thought it might prove my own caſe another time, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire one to have the ſame good Opinion of me, and therefore I thought I ought to do, as I would be done by. In the Street I was ſtopped again, by a ſpruce Servant Maid, who making a low Curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie or two, deſired me to look in her Hand, and give her a proof of my Skill; ſhe brought me into a Kitchen, to a light, and ſhewed me her Hand, but begg'd me to be ſecret, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned her Reputation:</p>
               <p>I told her, ſhe
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:44408:72"/>
might ſpeak freely to one who knew not her Name, nor was ever likely to ſee her again. I am Courted <hi>(ſaid ſhe)</hi> by an Old Man, who is very Rich; I love a Young one, who as very poor:</p>
               <p>The Young one I dare not marry, for fear of Beggery; the Old one I muſt not, becauſe I cannot endure him:</p>
               <p>In this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty I would live as I am, were it not that the young Man took his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage on me in the Critical minute; and now I muſt make choice of one, or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for fear of being with Child, and for ever diſgraced; tell me, in this caſe, which will thrive beſt with me. I remember'd I was <hi>Celadon</hi> ſtill, for all my Habit, and therefore conſidering the neceſſities of thoſe Youths, whoſe niggardly Fortune would not let them Marry, and the Dotage of feeble old Age, that will needs be Lovers, when their ſeaſon's paſt, I adviſed her to Marry the Old Man, and keep the Young one; that way <hi>(ſaid I)</hi> you will enjoy the Love of the one, and the Riches of the other. Her Maſter coming in at that time, and asking what I was, the Maid told him, I was a Fortune-teller:</p>
               <p>Go thy ways, Girl, <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> and leave me to ſpeak a word to her:</p>
               <p>When ſhe
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:44408:72"/>
was gone, he pulled out a Silver Groat, telling me, I ſhould have that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve him a queſtion. Sir, <hi>(ſaid I)</hi> though I ſometimes tell the Poor their Fortunes for nothing, yet I never do it to the Rich under half a piece. I am not one of your ignorant rambling Gypſies; I'll tell you your Fortune, as it ſhall fall out to a Hair:</p>
               <p>Well, here's half a Piece for you, <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> if you tell it ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, for 'tis a thing of moment:</p>
               <p>I am about to marry a handſome Girl; the only ſcruple I have againſt it, is, that theſe young Jigglets are ſo wild, that I fear 'twill be hard to keep her conſtant; tell me therefore, whether ſhe will be true to me, or no? What Age are you of, <hi>(ſaid I)?</hi> But threeſcore and eight, <hi>(ſaid he):</hi> I looked in his Hand, and took his Gold, and told him, that the Virgin would prove as honeſt to him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Marriage, as ſhe was to her Vertue, before he Weds her. This was a true anſwer, for I fancied it was his own Maid that he meant, and how honeſt ſhe was, I knew by her own Confeſſion. I went away laughing at the folly of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous old Age, that would throw more Money away, towards the ſatisfying an impotent deſire, than he would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:44408:73"/>
have given a Phyſician, for the ſaving his Life. The Prince laugh'd at the pleaſant uſe which <hi>Celadon</hi> had made of his diſguiſe; and they two debated for a while which was the greater weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that of the Old Man, to truſt his Honour to a Young Woman's Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; or that of the Maiden, to truſt hers to the Conſtancy of an Officer. The Prince placed his own Folly in the firſt rank; and ſaid, it was greater than the other two, to truſt all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and quiet of his Life, to the rigour of a diſdainful Woman; to cringe to one that was beneath him, and ſubmit himſelf to one, who could not pretend to a higher Match, than one of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants:</p>
               <p>But when Love tock her part, it made him recant all theſe Reflections, clad the meanneſs of his paſſion in a lovelier dreſs, and made it ſeem, either no fault at all, or one of the leaſt, the moſt pardonable of his Life. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended <hi>Celadon</hi>'s diſcretion, in indulging her the hopes of Marrying him, for fear her Vertue ſhould otherwiſe have made her ſhun him. The next morning word was brought to the Prince, that the King was near the Town:</p>
               <p>He drew up all his Men, in order to receive his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:44408:73"/>
and after having kiſſed his Hand, and diſcourſed with him, concerning the preparations requiſite to the Siege, the Prince came home to put all things in readineſs for his next days March:</p>
               <p>But that which he accounted the chief, was to take his leave of <hi>Marinda.</hi> He found her alone in her Room; and though ſhe ſeemed uneaſie, yet he conſtrained her to ſtay, and hear a long ſtory of his Paſſion; which he ſet forth in the moſt prevailing words, accompanied with the moſt winning Carriage, that Art and Nature, joyned together, could invent. At laſt he gain'd ſo much upon her, as that ſhe conſented to receive a Letter from him, while he was in the Camp. He came back to <hi>Celadon</hi> with a mixture of Gladneſs and Sorrow; Gladneſs at the favour ſhe had granted him, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of Writing to her; and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to think that he muſt purchaſe that ſatisfaction at ſo dear a rate, as the loſs of her Company, as long as the Siege ſhould continue. I will not ſet down how many of theſe Fits of Joy and Grief he had, whilſt he was in the Camp; neither will I Romance ſo much, as to white down all the thoughts he had of her, and all the many wiſe Dialogues
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:44408:74"/>
he had with himſelf about her; thoſe the Reader can better imagine, than the Author tell; at leaſt, if he has any of the ſame Paſſion the Prince was poſſeſſed with:</p>
               <p>That will make him ſympathize exactly with his Highneſs's thoughts, as two Clocks, well made, keep time with one another. Thus much I know, that they were ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate with him, that they could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be lull'd aſleep, by the ſtillneſs of the Night, nor diverted by the terrors of the Day:</p>
               <p>They kept him company continually, followed him even into the Enemies Trenches, and when Shot of all ſorts flew thickeſt about his Ears, they were neither ſtill'd by the noiſe of the greater, nor frighten'd away by the ſmall. Among all theſe thoughts, he did not forget thoſe of writing to her; nor had he been three Weeks away, when calling to him one of his truſtieſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, he ordered him to take Horſe for <hi>Clonmell,</hi> and, with all the privacy ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, deliver her this Letter.</p>

               <p>But Fortune had otherwiſe ordered it, for <hi>Sarsfeild</hi> with an unuſual Bravery, marched with a ſmall Body of Horſe, farther into that part of the Country which was Subjected to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Power, than they ſuſpected he durſt; ſurprized the Convoy, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to pieces, burnt them, their Carriages and Proviſions, (which they brought for the Army) to aſhes; ſome of the Carriages he nailed up, and burſt the reſt; and the Army wanting them to batter the walls, and the haſty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Winter, not giving them time to ſend for others, they raiſed the Siege; his Majeſty went for <hi>England;</hi> his Forces retired to their winter Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and our Prince to his Miſtreſs. I truſt, the Reader will not think it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to our Prince's Honour, to come back without taking the Town, this

               <p>Our Prince did not pretend to impoſſible Exploits, but as far as pure Natural Force, and Courage could go; he might have been ranked in the firſt File of the Army; he was not aſhamed, that he could not do impoſſibilities, but came back to <hi>Clonmell</hi> with as brisk a Look, and as glad a Heart, as if he had Routed <hi>Sarsfeild,</hi> and laid <hi>Limerick</hi> in Aſhes. The place where he Lodg'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was made ready for him, but he had other deſigns, and therefore Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemented ſome of the other Officers with thoſe Quarters, and choſe <hi>Marin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>'s Mothers for his. But when he firſt accoſted his long abſent Miſtreſs, 'twas in Terms ſo paſſionate, that the inability of the Author makes, him forbear to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them; nor could he match them, though he borrowed <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Brain to invent, and a Quill plucked from one of Cupid's Wings to write them down; neither would he think it ſafe to expreſs them to the Life if he could, leſt a

               <p>Thus much the Author will aſſure you, that they had as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful an effect, as he could deſire over his Miſtreſs; or as the moſt Amorous of my Readers could wiſh to have over his own:</p>
               <p>She laid aſide that reſervedneſs which ſhe obſerved to other Men, and confeſſed her Love, as freely as ſhe gave it him; that Night, he told <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> of the welcome he received; and <hi>Celadon</hi> asked him, whether he intended to Marry her? This Queſtion put the Prince to a ſtand, and he asked <hi>Celadon</hi> whether there was any poſſibility of Enjoying her without it: <hi>Celadon</hi> told his Highneſs, he would try, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with the vvay, and the Prince approving of it, the next after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon he put it in Execution:</p>
               <p>He went to wait on <hi>Marinda</hi>'s Couſin, whom he Courted, and they two being pretty Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, the young Gentlewoman began to talk about the Love the Prince bare

her Couſin; ſhe did it to ſound him, and to find whether the Prince's Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection was real. <hi>Celadon,</hi> who watched for ſuch an opportunity, ſaid, yes truly, the Prince had an unfeigned Affection for her fair Couſin, ſo violent a one, that notwithſtanding the difference of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Prince would Marry her if he were ſingle. What, is he Married then ſaid the young Lady, extreamly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd? Why, did not you know it, Madam, <hi>ſaid he?</hi> ſince through inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency I have blabb'd it out, for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven's ſake do not let it be known that it came from me, for then I ſhall be for ever out of the Prince's favour. She promiſed ſhe would not, and ſo left him, to carry the News of it with all ſpeed to her Couſin. The Prince having left a great part of his Men in <hi>Clonmell,</hi> was gone out of Town that Morning at the Head of the reſt, accompanying the groſs of the Army which was Marching towards <hi>Dublin;</hi> and on the morrow about mid-day, he took leave of the Officers, to return to <hi>Clonmell;</hi> he brought but one Man back to wait on him, who had a Horſeman's uſual Arms, Sword and Piſtols, and the Prince had a flight Morin on, and a Buff-coat, both

               <p>The Prince rode up, and commanded them to deſiſt, and let him know what was the cauſe of their Quarrel; one of them gave him a ſhort Anſwer in <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and at the ſame time made a thruſt at him with his Pitch-fork, which by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce's ſudden ſpurring his Horſe miſſed him, and ran the Beaſt into the belly, the Prince drawing out a Piſtol, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Iriſhman</hi>'s Complement with a ſhot, and laid him dead at his Horſe's feet; he had done the ſame ſervice with his other Piſtol, but that the Beaſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged with the double wound which <hi>Teague</hi>'s weapon had given him, kick'd and flung ſo, that the Prince was forced to alight; the Man which waited on his Highneſs, did more Execution with his Piſtols, and having with them, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led one, and wounded another, he alighted and drew his Sword to Fight by his Maſter, who by this time had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd two more, not without receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great wound, which one of them with a half-pike had given him in the ſide; the Prince enrag'd at that, fell

fiercer on the reſt, and the Stranger who hitherto had been only on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fencive part, having but one to deal with, gave him his <hi>mittimus</hi> to the other World, and came up to fall on thoſe who had more than their hands-full of the Prince and his Man; but at his coming, finding themſelves too weak, they ſought that ſafety in their heels, which their Swords could not give them; the Prince and his Man had Jackboots on, and were unable to follow them; and the Stranger was ſo weary with the Blood he had loſt, and the wearineſs of ſo tedious a conflict, that he had ſcarce ſtrength enough to keep him on his Legs; however, he uſed that little he had in coming up to the Prince, and thanking him for his own Life, and his beautious Companions; the Prince told him, he owed it to his own Valour, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Heaven, which ſeldom fails to help the Couragious, eſpecially when they have Juſtice on their ſide:</p>
               <p>The Prince ordering his Man to look to the ſtrangers Wounds and bind them up, went himſelf to Compliment the Lady upon her delivery:</p>
               <p>He found her lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on her Maid, bewailing the Death of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:44408:81"/>
that Stranger who was killed before he came there, but how was he amazed, when looking in her Face he found it to be <hi>Marinda:</hi> When he firſt came in to her aſſiſtance, her Hoods were over her Face; which was the Reaſon he did not know her, and the Beavor of his Mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being down was the cauſe of the like ignorance in her; though he very little expected to meet her there, yet the joy to ſee her ſafe, overcame his amazement, and he was about to teſtifie it, with all the extaſie which his Paſſion raiſed in him:</p>
               <p>When ſhe, caſting an angry frown at him, ſaid, I thought, Sir, to have given my Deliverer the greateſt thanks for the reſcuing yonder Gentleman's Life, and my Honour, from the Hands of theſe wicked Villains; but ſince it is to you I muſt pay them; I muſt at the ſame time declare, that I had rather they ſhould have taken my Life, than, forced me to owe it to you; go, leave me to be a prey to them whom thou haſt hunted away, for I had rather dye here, bemoaning this poor Gentleman who fell in the defence of my Honour, than take refuge with you, who whilſt you defend it from others, endeavour to prey upon it your ſelf. He anſwered
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:44408:81"/>
her very mildly, and would fain have expoſtulated with her concerning his Innocence, but ſhe ſat over the Dead Gentleman bewailing him, and would not hearken, nor anſwer one word to what he ſaid; the Prince having found her ſo kind at his laſt ſeeing her in <hi>Clon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell,</hi> wondered ſtrangely at this Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio of his Fortune, and turning away from her, went to the wounded Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, to ſee whether he could unfold him the Riddle. He ſaid, all that he knew of it, was, that the Dead Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was a profeſſed Servant to her, as he was to her Couſin, and that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi> having made a ſudden reſolution to go for <hi>Dublin,</hi> they two proffer'd to accompany her thither; that ſhe would not let them take as much as a Man with them, becauſe ſhe would not have any one know which way they were gone; that ſhe had deſir'd them to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the High-roads as much as they could, becauſe ſhe had no mind to be known by any who came from <hi>Dublin</hi>-ward; that in this by-road they met thoſe Rapperees, who bade them deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; that the Gentleman who Courted her, ſhot at one of them and killed him; that then they all fell upon them two,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44408:82"/>
who had no other way to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the two Women, than by letting them go behind them, and they defend that gap, till ſome others Riding that Road might come to their help; that the Gentleman was killed, as he made a paſs at that ſecond Man who lay Dead by him, and that himſelf, ſnatching up the Dead Man's half-pike, as being a better defence than his Sword, had held them all in play till he came into his Reſcue. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies expreſſing ſo great a reſentment againſt him, made the Stranger curious to know who it was; but the Servant had no ſooner informed him that it was the Prince of <hi>S—g,</hi> but he begged a thouſand pardons for the rudeneſs his ignorance made him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; and ſaid, that his Highneſs had acted with a Bravery ſuitable to his Quality; and that though he never before had the Honour to know him, yet what he had ſeen his Highneſs perform in this little acquaintance, ſhould make him reſpect him more for his Deſerts, than his Title. The Prince had very little reliſh for all the Praiſes the Stranger heaped upon him, and only deſired him to prevail with the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:44408:82"/>
Lady, to go back to <hi>Clonmell</hi> with him. While the Prince's Man went to catch the Horſes, the Stranger perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Marinda</hi> to return back with him; and getting all upon the Horſes, they rode before, only the Prince got upon his Man's, and the Man on the Dead Gentleman's, and laying the Body before him, they Rode to the next. Town; the Gentleman's wounds were ſlight ones, and needed little Cure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides reſt and a recruit of Blood; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went with <hi>Marinda</hi> the next day to <hi>Clonmell;</hi> but the Prince's wound was large, and had loſt him ſo much Blood, that his Life was in danger. <hi>Marinda</hi> the next day ſent him a Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a Hearſe, to carry the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to <hi>Clonmell,</hi> he was Buried there, and ſhe ſhewed ſuch an exceſſive Grief at his Funeral, that no one who knew he Courted her, but thought that ſhe Loved him; the Prince's being wounded came to <hi>Celadon</hi>'s Ears, but he wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that it was in reſcuing <hi>Marinda,</hi> whom he thought all the while to have been at home; he ſtreight took Horſe and came to the Prince, and found him very weak, wanting reſt, and incapable of taking any: to hear that his Rival was

               <p>He only made a ſlight matter of it, and told his Highneſs that if he woold write a Line by him, for a pretence to him to ſee her, he would ſoon accommodate the difference; and ſet him as much in her Favour as ever; the Prince ſeemed to give but little cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to theſe hopes, but becauſe he would leave nothing unattempted, ordering that no body ſhould diſturb their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy, he bade <hi>Celadon</hi> write, whilſt he dictated him theſe words.</p>

               <p>She was not to be ſpoken with, but he met with <hi>Diana,</hi> (ſo was his Miſtreſs called) and after the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Complements paſt, he asked her how he ſhould ſpeak with her Couſin:</p>
               <p>No way, <hi>(ſaid ſhe)</hi> there's no acceſs for you, becauſe you come from the Prince. Why, Madam, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> is not <hi>Marin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> ſatisfied that the Prince has ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently hazarded his Life in her defence, but that ſhe'll endanger it farther by her Cruelty? Cruelty! <hi>(anſwered ſhe)</hi> why what kindneſs can he expect from a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Woman? Or what would the Wedded <hi>S—g</hi> with the Chaſte <hi>Marinda?</hi> And is that all the reaſon of her Anger? (<hi>ſaid</hi> Celadon,) Has the poor Prince ſuffered all this for a word of mine? By Heaven <hi>(Madam)</hi> the Prince is ſingle, and I am perſwaded has as ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous deſigns on your Couſin, as I have on you. If he has no more on her <hi>(an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe)</hi> than I have on you, he would never again be at the expence of a ſigh for her:</p>
               <p>For your part, I here diſcharge you my acquaintance; your miſchievous Jeſt has been the cauſe of a great deal of Grief, both to my Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin and me, for the Gentleman's death,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:44408:85"/>
the other Gentleman's weakneſs, and the endangering the Prince's Life:</p>
               <p>You have jeſted fairly, you had like to have jeſted the Prince at once out of his Life and Miſtreſs, your-ſelf you have jeſted out of my Favour, I will aſſure you; and ſo farewell good jeſting, Mr. <hi>Celadon,</hi> for if I ever any more admit of your Jeſts, I'll give you leave to make a Jeſt of me as long as you live. Saying this ſhe flung away into her Couſins Room, and all that <hi>Celadon</hi> could ſay, could not get either of them to ſpeak a word to him. She told <hi>Marinda</hi> that the Prince was innocent, and, by <hi>Celadon</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, had no deſigns, but what were honourable and virtuous:</p>
               <p>At the ſame time the Maid came up, and brought them a Letter, which <hi>Celadon</hi> ſent to <hi>Marinda,</hi> and the ſame which he had written from the Prince's Mouth; the Servant told them that he was returning to the Prince, and deſired to ſee them before he went, that he might know what Service they had to command him. Neither of them would conſent to ſee one who had been the Author of their late troubles:</p>
               <p>But <hi>Diana</hi> told her Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin that the Prince, who was innocent, ought not to ſuffer for him; that ſhe

ſhould rather ſhew her ſelf kinder than ever, to one ſhe had ſo cauſeleſly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented: <hi>Marinda</hi>'s own Love did take his part ſo much, and joyn ſo prevalent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with her Couſin's Arguments, that it made her give ſome ſmall interval to her Griefs, to pay that which was due to her Love. She wrote a Letter, and ſent it to <hi>Celadon,</hi> who made what haſte he could to leave an angry Miſtreſs, to ſee his wounded Prince, and cure his Body, by this ſovereign Ballſom which he brought for his mind. The Prince (when he came before him) would not ſtay to tell him how he did, till he firſt asked how he had ſucceeded. <hi>As well for you, Sir,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>as you can wiſh, and as ill for my ſelf; how ill for my ſelf, I will tell you hereafter; how well for your Highneſs, this Letter will acquaint you.</hi> At theſe words he gave him the Letter; and the Prince, with a great deal of haſte, breaking it open, found theſe words.</p>

               <p>Beſides, her Baggs which are ſo large and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, it would grieve my heart to part with them, after I was in ſo fair a way for obtaining her.

               <p>His impatient Love would ſtay no longer than till he was able to travel, and then it carried him back to <hi>Clonmell,</hi> to ſee his long abſent Miſtreſs:</p>
               <p>He rode to his Lodgings at <hi>Marinda</hi>'s Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but hearing Muſick in the Houſe, and the Mirth of Company within, he asked what was the Matter. 'Tis, <hi>(ſaid one)</hi> a preparation for Madam <hi>Diana</hi>'s Wedding, who is juſt now to be Married.

Saying this, he alighted, and ruſhed into the Houſe, and the Prince followed him in to ſee what his deſign was. <hi>Celadon</hi> entered juſt as the Ceremony began, and with a threatning voice cryed, <q rend="inline italic">I forbid the Banes; and if the intended Bridegroom will

               <p>Some Officers were there, the Bridgerooms Friends, and would have taken up his quarrel, but forbore out of reſpect to the Prince, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting what he would do in it.

               <p>Had ſhe been at his diſpoſal, <hi>Celadon</hi> ſhould have had her, if at her Parents, they had decided it for the <hi>Spaniard:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thought it beſt to leave it to her ſelf, and therefore ſpoke to this purpoſe. <q rend="inline italic">

                     <p>The <hi>Spaniard</hi> has been the more Complaiſant, but the <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
                        <pb n="166" facs="tcp:44408:89"/>
the Fonder:</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Spaniard</hi> the truer Courtier, but the <hi>Engliſhman</hi> the truer Lover; therefore, as commonly Love is ſooneſt raiſed in one Breaſt, by ſeeing it firſt in the other, ſo the <hi>Engliſhman</hi> has the advantage of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and my heart catched that Paſſion, as it were by Contagion from his:</p>
                     <p>Yet, on the other ſide, I ſhould not forget my Duty; my Father takes the <hi>Spaniard</hi>'s part, well, but Love takes the <hi>Engliſhman</hi>'s:</p>
                     <p>Then I muſt beg my Father's pardon, if I leave the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to receive his reward from him whom he courted, and deſire the Company to judge, if I ought not rather to yield him my Love, who ſued to me for it, than to him who Courted my Parents.</p>
                  </q> The Company was divided in their opinions, as their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance byaſſed them; and ſome mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured as the Inconſtancy of her Humour, whilſt others applauded her Choice. <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon</hi> ran to give her thanks, with all the kindeſt expreſſions his Joy could inſpire him with; and his Rival, diſtracted with Grief and Shame at his unexpected re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, ſtood uncertain on that ſudden E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergency, how to behave himſelf:</p>
               <p>He was awaked out of this Trance, by a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, who came to him, and ſaid, Take heart, Seignior, be not aſhamed of a Denial, which not your want of Merit, but my Contrivance was the occaſion of;
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:44408:89"/>
'twas I that perſuaded the Lady to refuſe you, and I truſt you will pardon me, when I ſay it was for my own ſake that I did it. Without queſtion the Company thought this an odd ſort of Confidence, for a Gentlewoman to Court a Man, in ſo kind terms, and ſo publickly too:</p>
               <p>Her Garb was very fine, her Shape and Air gentile, and her Face, which was one of the moſt amiable ones there, ſpake her to be in the prime of her years; yet neither her Dreſs, Youth, Beauty, or Love, could prevail the leaſt on our diſcontented <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who would not once vouchſafe to look on her. What then, <hi>(ſaid ſhe)</hi> is my Conſtancy thus requited? Or can two years time cauſe ſo much alteration, as to make <hi>Aſtolfo</hi> forget me? Theſe words made the <hi>Spaniard</hi> turn towards her, and he no ſooner ſaw her Face, but he cry'd out, am I in a Dream? Or do I truly behold once again, the Face of my beloved <hi>Faniaca?</hi> Now, <hi>Celadon,</hi> I yield thee up thy Miſtreſs, and quit all my pretenſions to her, for this which I have newly found. <hi>Celadon</hi> gladly thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for his ſubmiſſion to <hi>Diana</hi>'s Choice, and all the Company bore a part with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in the Joy he conceived at the change of his Miſtreſs:</p>
               <p>But the beautiful <hi>Indian,</hi> who longed to hear how
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:44408:90"/>
he came for <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſaid, It is now, my <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolfo,</hi> two years ſince you and I parted, wonder not then if I am deſirous to know what befell you ſince that, and how you eſcaped a Death which ſo apparently threatned you; my endeavours to find you out here, made me relate all the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of our Acquaintance hitherto, and therefore I believe there is no accident in the remaining part of your Life, which is too ſecret for the Ears of this honourable Company:</p>
               <p>I have had none, <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> which I will not freely tell, but to the underſtanding my Relation, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that this Illuſtrious Company ſhould know ſome things, which for want of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, have as yet been a ſecret to you, as well as to them. My Father is a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of a plentiful Eſtate near <hi>Sevill,</hi> by my Mothers death he was left a Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dower with two Children, Me and a Daughter, both which he was very fond of, as being his only Comforts, the Relicts of his deceaſed Wife, and the Pledges of his youthful Love:</p>
               <p>There li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved near us an old Couple who had the like number of Children, a Son and a Daughter, they were intimate Friends of my Father's, and ſo free with us, that notwithſtanding the ſevere reſtraints of our Countrey upon young Perſons, yet
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:44408:90"/>
our Families obſerved no ſuch Cuſtom, but we young ones converſed with one another with the ſame freedom as if we had been near Relations:</p>
               <p>And as youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful familiarity in different Sexes, uſually ends in Love, ſo it proved with us, for our Neighbour's Son and my Siſter had ſuch a mutual Affection, that they were never well but in one anothers Company; and his Siſter, whether by her own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or their ſetting on, ſeemed as uneaſie unleſs when ſhe was in mine; had ſhe been handſome, perhaps I ſhould have taken as much diverſion in his Siſter's Company, as he did in mine; but I thought thoſe Complements thrown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, which were beſtowed on an ugly Face; nor could my Wit help me with one fond Vow or happy Expreſſion, for want of Beauty to inſpire it; This made me avoid her Company to get into his; but when I ſaw him ſhun mine as much, and that he and my Siſter coveted to be always together; his growing more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to me than formerly, and ſome ſymptoms which I perceived in my Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; her frequent ſighs at parting, her bluſhes at meeting him, and ſome other ſlips, which the moſt diſſembling of your Sex find difficult to hide, gave me appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent cauſe to think that ſhe loved him.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:44408:91"/>
He and I were once as great as 2 <hi>Brothers</hi> laid our Breaſts open to one another thence his never diſcovering the leaſt to me, concerning his paſſion for my Siſter, made his Love look to me, as if it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned nothing that was honeſt. I had then to wait on me a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Captive, who was taken away young, and having been bred up ſeveral years in my Father's Houſe, was very truſty and diſcreet; I let no one know my ſuſpitions, but him, and ordered him to be a Spy on all my Siſter's Actions; and if ever he obſerved any thing remarkable between them two, that he would acquaint me with it:</p>
               <p>He obſerved my Commands, and one time brought me word, that he had over-heard him and my Siſter diſcourſing; that ſhe deſired him to ask her of my Father, and that very ſoon, or ſhe ſhould be diſcovered to be with Child, and ſo be diſgraced, and turned out of Doors; tho' this was but what I feared to find out, yet now I found thoſe fears true, it enraged me both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him and my Siſter:</p>
               <p>However, the conſideration of her Sex's weakneſs (which is an unequal Combatant for Love, when aſſiſted by earneſtneſs and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity) made me pardon her ſo far, as to leave her to be puniſhed by the ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of her own Folly; but him I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:44408:91"/>
to be revenged on:</p>
               <p>Tho' my blood boyled at the firſt ſight of him, yet I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled my anger in publick, and told him that I had ſomething to impart to him, if he would take a walk with me into the Fields in the cool of the Evening; he conſented, and we went out together; at we walked on talking, I drew him inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly to a private place, and then reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a little diſtance from him, I bade him draw:</p>
               <p>Sure you are in jeſt <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> you will not draw that Sword againſt your Friend, which you have before now drawn in my defence:</p>
               <p>This Sword <hi>(ſaid I)</hi> was drawn then for my Friend, but now againſt the worſt of mine Enemies, one who has abuſed my Friendſhip, and my Siſter's Love:</p>
               <p>Yet thus much I will give to our former Affection, Marry her, and ſalve up the Injury thou haſt done her, and I will forgive thee mine:</p>
               <p>What, <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> and are you turned a Bravo to hector me into Marriage? Know then that I will never do it, neither ſhall it ever be ſaid, that <hi>Guzman</hi> valued his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſo little, as to make a Wife of his Whore. Whore! <hi>(ſaid I)</hi> that word I will engrave on thy traiterous Heart; at theſe words he leapt back and drew, I made at him with a great deal of Fury; but being appeaſed by ſome Blood I drew
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:44408:92"/>
from him, I proffered him again the ſame conditions of Reconciliation; but his Rage made him deaf to Reaſon:</p>
               <p>We fought on, till one thruſt I made at his Breaſt ended our difference, by his fall:</p>
               <p>I fled in all haſte to the Sea-ſide, where by good chance there was a Ship under Sail bound for the <hi>Indies;</hi> I went aboard her; Landed in <hi>America</hi> amongſt ſome Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who were ſent to re-inforce our Country Garriſons there:</p>
               <p>I was a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Souldier, till a Fight that I ſignali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed my ſelf in, raiſed me to a Captain's Commiſſion; 'twas in this ſtation I was, when I came acquainted with you:</p>
               <p>You know the Captain of the Man of War, which boarded us, ſent me Priſoner to <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,</hi> with my other Countrymen:</p>
               <p>Near this Town my Father lived; I ſent him word of my being in Priſon, and he ſtreight came to ſee me, but told me, he muſt not own me for his Son, leſt it ſhould coſt me my Life:</p>
               <p>He applauded my revenging the diſhonour done to my Family; but ſaid, that there had been Warrants iſſued out againſt me, and 500 Duckats, by the deceaſed's Friends, promiſed him that ſhould ſeize me; that if I ſhould ſtand a Tryal, and eſcape the Law, yet their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate revenge would reach me; therefore, he ſaid he would make Friends for me and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:44408:92"/>
my fellow Priſoners, that we ſhould be diſmiſſed, and then he would have me ſpend ſome years abroad, and when Time, or Death had cured the malice of my <hi>Enemies,</hi> he would get my pardon, and call me home. I took his advice, and as ſoon as I was freed, hearing that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were raiſing Souldiers, for ſome deſign they had not yet divulged, I entered Volunteer into that Party which came for <hi>England;</hi> you have all heard how we ſucceeded, and that inſtead of a Battel, we came as it were to a Triumph; for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> came over to our ſide; thence we took Shipping for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in <hi>Dublin</hi> I received a ſupply from my Father, which bought me the Command of a Troop; I was at the <hi>Boyn</hi> near <hi>Schomberg</hi> when he was killed; I lay in the Camp before <hi>Limerick,</hi> and took my chance of War, among thoſe Brave Men that fell in the Trenches; I Quarrelled with the Prince t'other Night, miſtaking him for ſome Rival that Serenaded <hi>Diana;</hi> but the Guards coming up, and my finding out my Errour, delivered me from his Sword too:</p>
               <p>I was afterwards engaged with ten <hi>Iriſh</hi> at once, and fortunately reſcued by the Prince's Valour; ſo that my kind Stars preſerved me through all theſe dangers, to fall the ſecond time a Victim
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:44408:93"/>
to your Eyes, my former Conquerours; I Courted I confeſs that Lady, but it was, becauſe I ſaw not the leaſt likelihood, of ever finding my Beloved <hi>Faniaca;</hi> and therefore, I thought her Fortune would prove a good ſhelter for a Puniſhed Man, who had been toſſed from <hi>Spain</hi> to the <hi>Indies,</hi> from the <hi>Indies</hi> to <hi>Spain,</hi> from <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> from <hi>England</hi> hither, and one, that durit not ſet foot again on his Native Country:</p>
               <p>Beſides her Wit and good Humour, placed her much in my Eſteem, though all thoſe Perfections vaniſh in any Woman, when you my incomparable Miſtreſs are by. Thus the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ended his Relation, and the Company with no little pleaſure, reflected on the alterations of Fortune; which, after toſſing them ſo far aſunder, by the contrary guſts of Adverſity, now by one proſperous Gale, brought them together to their deſired Harbour:</p>
               <p>The two Happy Couple, would willingly have prevented all future dangers, by faſtning that indiſſoluble Knot, which nothing but Death can untye, but <hi>Marinda</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, her Couſin, to forbear hers for two or three days; and the Fair <hi>Indian</hi> deſired her <hi>Spaniard,</hi> to defer their Joys ſo long, it not being fit, that ſhe ſhould be admitted to ſo Solemn a Ceremony
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44408:93"/>
of the Church, as that of Matrimony, till ſhe were firſt liſted among the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of her Children:</p>
               <p>The Prieſt who came there no Celebrate their Marriage, performed this Solemnity, and all the Company wiſhed the Fair Convert Joy:</p>
               <p>Mirth and Feaſting took up the reſt of the day, and made up an intire Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, between the Brisk <hi>Celadon,</hi> and the Valiant <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who now Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled no longer for a Miſtreſs. But if ſome good natured Reader ſhould be too much concerned for the Amorous Prince, whoſe Intrigue ſeems to have ſtood ſtill, whilſt the others have run almoſt to the end of their Race; let him know, that his went the ſame pace with theirs; though the Author, to comply with <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi>'s Modeſty, brought her not ſo openly acting the Lover's part, as he did the brisk <hi>Diana,</hi> or the bolder <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian;</hi> for as the main wheel of a Clock, though it turns all the reſt, yet goes it ſelf with ſuch an inſenſible motion, that to an unskilful Eye it ſeems to ſtand ſtill; ſo the Prince's and <hi>Marinda</hi>'s A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, was carried on indiſcernably to others, and ſeem'd to them to be at a ſtand, whilſt indeed it was the chief mover of the two other Intrigues, and pointed out to them the long wiſhed for,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:44408:94"/>
the Matrimonial Hour:</p>
               <p>You muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore underſtand, that after all the dark unſucceſsful days which our Prince had ſighed away, in doubtful Hopes, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting Fears, and his laſt black ones of Deſpair; Fortune vindicated her old Title of Inconſtancy, in being kind to him again, in bringing him that propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious critical minute, in which they ſay, the Coyeſt Lady (if you nick the right time) is to be won:</p>
               <p>The Prince exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hit it in the firſt Viſit he made <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda;</hi> as ſoon as the deſigned Marriage was deferred, and the Company gone, he went to pay his particular Reſpects to the Lady of his Vows:</p>
               <p>He found her in the Garden with her Couſin, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing about the unexpected breaking off her Marriage, and <hi>Celadon</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his priviledge, taking her into an Ally aſide, left the Prince in another, with <hi>Marinda;</hi> and what time they had there together, he improved to the utmoſt, in ſhewing her how ſincerely he had been her Servant, from the firſt ſight he ever had of her, till then; and told her, what he required of her in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation, and upon what Honourable Conditions he expected it; ſhe anſwered with all the kindneſs due to ſo fond a Lover, and with a mixture of that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:44408:94"/>
Civility, which ſhe paid him as he was a Prince, tho' one who profeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf her Servant; and that his Highneſs might not cenſure her to have beep ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rude or Cruel in her Behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, through the whole courſe of their Acquaintance; ſhe deſired, that he would hear thoſe things from her Couſin's Mouth, which ſhe thought not ſo fit for her own; <hi>Diana</hi> was called for, and <hi>Marinda</hi> deſiring her to acquaint the Prince with all ſhe knew of her Thoughts, without diſguiſing any thing; ſhe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed with <hi>Celadon</hi> apart, while her Couſin began thus to the Prince, who was more than ordinarily attentive. When my Couſin ordered me to tell you her greateſt; privacies, thoſe of her Love; ſhe did but give the Reins to that paſſion, which has alwaies been too ſtrong for her, ſince firſt the Graces your Highneſs is maſter of, reduced her to the condition of a Lover; and I queſtion not, but ſhe has had undeniable proofs of an equal Affection in you; or elſe, (by what I know of her Humour) ſhe would rather have Died, than once ſuffered it to be known; your Highneſs over-hearing our Diſcourſe at the Well, opened a light to the diſcovery of that Affection, which otherwiſe had been
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:44408:95"/>
doom'd to perpetual obſcurity; for though your Highneſs, did make ſome Addreſſes to her, which as ſhe told me, ſerved to ruin her the more, yet they would never have proved any advantage to you; ſince we both thought, that you ſpoke out of Raillery more than any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious deſign; beſides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the higheſt tide of her Paſſion, ſhe profeſſed, he would rather ſuffer any thing than own it to you; the firſt Night your Highneſs Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renaded her, ſhe ſhewed ſo little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern at it, till you were gone, that I thought it had been a Frolick of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi>'s Gallantry, who about that time came acquainted with me, 'twas I ſpoke to you out of the window, though when the difference of Voice diſcovered my miſtake, I broke off the parly; that time the <hi>Indian</hi> came to Town, and lighting firſt into my Couſin's Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſhe told her the Dream ſhe had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout you; I will not tell it over again, becauſe your Highneſs has heard it alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, only in vindication of the <hi>Indian</hi>'s Skill, let me aſſure your Highneſs, that ſhe told my Couſin, ſhe ſhould have the Gentleman ſhe Dreamed of; ſhe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted the little Archer, who was on your ſide, to be Love, the Giant on hers, Honour; that Honour's going o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:44408:95"/>
to your ſide, and leaving her defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſignified, that your proffering to Marry her, would overcome her obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy; and the Cupid's ſhooting her through, is eaſie enough to be left to your Highneſs's Explanation; the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> promiſing her ſucceſs, made her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge that Love, which ſhe bridled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and brought her abroad to the Ball: <hi>Marinda,</hi> Madam, was nor at the laſt Ball, <hi>ſaid the Prince:</hi> Yes, Sir, <hi>ſaid</hi> Diana, if your Highneſs remembers, there were two in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dreſs, the one was the <hi>Indian,</hi> the other <hi>Marinda;</hi> but ſure, <hi>ſaid the Prince, Marinda</hi> was not not with her in my Room the next day:</p>
               <p>She was with your Highneſs both times, <hi>ſaid</hi> Diana; nay, it was ſhe whoſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice you asked in the Cloſet; ſhe came home that Night, with all the marks of a violent Grief, at ſomething which your Highneſs had ſaid to her, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved withall, never to ſee, hear, or ſpeak to you more; when ſhe repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Fortune-Teller, ſhe forbad your Highneſs to proſecute the Intrigue any farther, unleſs you deſigned to carry it on Honourably; and your going on with it, by giving her your Company ſo often afterwards, and the <hi>Indians</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> averring that ſhe was deſtined for you,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:44408:96"/>
made her believe, your Highneſs had altered your mind for the better; as you know, Lovers above all People are apteſt to believe things will come to paſs fortunately, meerly becauſe they would have it ſo; this her belief was ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the kind promiſing Letter you ſent her from <hi>Limerick;</hi> which Letter, induced me too, to think that your Highneſs had deſigned ſomething to her advantage:</p>
               <p>You ſaw what a free reception ſhe gave you, at your return from the Camp, till <hi>Celadon</hi>'s telling me that you were Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, daſhed all the Joy I conceived at the proſperity of her Amour, and was very near breaking her Heart, in endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to gain a Conqueſt over her Love; but when ſhe found how difficult that was, ſhe ſaid, ſhe would puniſh your illegal Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and her own at the ſame time; and leſt a fit of Love ſhould make her recant, ſhe put it in Execution immediately; there was a Gentleman of a conſiderable Fortune, who had ſeen her at my Father's in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and fallen in Love with her; this Gentleman being then come to <hi>Clon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell</hi> to ſee her, ſhe deſired him to wait on her to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and I deſired my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> that he would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her thither; ſhe told me, that ſhe would rather Marry him whom ſhe did
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:44408:96"/>
not Love, than give a longer encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to any unlawful Affection, which your Highneſs might entertain for her; that would have bereaved you of her for ever, had not ſhe been met by thoſe Rapperees; her Servant fell there, and though ſhe was mightily concerned for your Highneſs's danger, yet her Vertue drew thoſe Tears from her, which ſhe thought due to her Defender's Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; and might ſerve to make you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, ever coming into her favour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:</p>
               <p>But when <hi>Celadon</hi> undeceived us, by telling me that your being Married, was only an invention of his own, Shame and Love returned very powerfully upon her; Shame, that ſhe had uſed you ſo ill without a cauſe; and that Love, which before was only ſuppreſt by her Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, flouriſhed now with greater vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour than before; This diſcovery which regained your Highneſs her Affection, loſt <hi>Celadon</hi> mine; and my Anger at his crafty deceit, and his being the cauſe of ſo much bloodſhed, (though innocently) made me reſolve on the ſame way to get rid of him, which my Couſin deſigned againſt you, that is, by Marrying ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gentleman, who had my Father's Conſent, coming then wounded from a Journey which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:44408:97"/>
to ſerve me; I thought once to reward his Service, and puniſh <hi>Celadon</hi>'s Falſeneſs, and imagined I might do it with leſs diſturbance, whilſt your indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition kept him out of the way; but Fate, which they ſay preſides over our Marriages, as well as our Deaths, orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it otherwiſe, and brought him juſt time enough to ſuſpend it. The Prince gave the moſt ample demonſtrations of Joy, at the ſetledneſs which this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhew'd to be in <hi>Marinda</hi>'s Love; and having thank'd the Ingenious <hi>Diana</hi> for the comfort ſhe had given him, he walked towards the other Couple; they joyned Company, and the Prince deſired <hi>Marinda</hi> that ſhe would compleat his Happineſs, by ſetting <hi>Celadon</hi> as high in his Miſtreſs's Favour, as himſelf was in hers:</p>
               <p>The Beautiful <hi>Marinda</hi> grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him this requeſt, as the firſt demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of her Obedience; ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured it ſo effectually, that preſently ſhe made her Couſin pardon <hi>Celadon</hi>'s for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer miſcarriage, and receive him again into her favour; neither did <hi>Marinda</hi> find it any thing difficult to perſuade her to this; for of all People, Miſtreſſes are the moſt forgiving, indulgent Perſons to thoſe they Love; and let them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble it as much as they pleaſe, they

cannot be long Angry at any fault a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver commits, unleſs it ſeem to proceed from want of Affection; but <hi>Celadon</hi> not being of that Nature, was ſoon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, and as a proof of it, was encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to hope ſhe would Vote for him:</p>
               <p>The next morning, the <hi>Indian</hi> came to wait on the two Couſins, and told <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> that he who was in Election to be her Husband, was the <hi>Spaniard</hi> whom ſhe had been ſo long looking for; <hi>Marinda</hi> had invited her to the Wedding, and ſhe came in a little after the Prince had deferr'd it, and then ſeeing it put off, would not diſcover her ſelf to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard;</hi> ſhe deſired <hi>Diana</hi> to keep him ſtill in ignorance, that when he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, ſhe might ſee how he would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelf to her: <hi>Diana</hi> deſired no leſs than ſhe, that it might be kept ſecret, leſt <hi>Celadon</hi> ſhould eſteem her love the leſs, thinking that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> being owned by another, made her take him for a ſhift; this was the reſult of the three days Tryal, and hence it came to paſs, that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> dejected at the loſs of one Miſtreſs, was elevated by the unexpected finding out another, whom he Loved better:</p>

the expected day came, and rewarded the three longing Lovers with the intire poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of their Miſtreſſes:</p>
               <p>The Beautiful <hi>Marinda,</hi> the Ingenious <hi>Diana,</hi> and the Pritty <hi>Faniaca,</hi> ſubmitted themſelves to the power of their Youthful Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. <hi>Diana</hi> had all the felicity ſhe could wiſh, in having him ſhe Loved; the <hi>Indian</hi> gained not only her dear <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> but a Fortune with him, for he that day received News from his Father, that his old Enemy was Dead, his Pardon taken out, and with it, he had orders to come home, and take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of an Eſtate his Father gave him; the Beautiful <hi>Marinda</hi> received the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of her invincible Vertue, in Loving and being Beloved, and in having gained a Prince, who raiſed her Quality as high (in compariſon of what ſhe was before) as a Woman's Ambition could deſire; theſe were the Pleaſures of the Wedding Day, heightned by the addition of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, Feaſting, and Mirth; but the Night came, we muſt like their Bride Maids, conduct them to their Beds, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Curtains leave them there, to the full Enjoyment of thoſe Pleaſures, whoſe Raptures, none but Experienced Lovers know, and the Conſtant ones may expect to attain.</p>
