            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

meanes to signifie
my affection vnto
you: I thought I could not
better do it, nor find a more

by preferring and dedicating

yeares (I doubt not) will
bring to an excellency of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
To the furtherance
wherof, albeit this smal Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise

(who was one of his nearest fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorities)
deuising with him of many
things as they were at meate, let fall
this fable of set purpose. The Lion
(quoth he) being chosen king by the
other beasts: they all came to do him
reuerence: the Hart (which is a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beast) approching to salute him
with the rest, and bending himselfe
before him, the Lion tooke him by
the hornes purposing to deuoure
him: but the Hart drew away his
head with that strength and force as
he escaped and saued himselfe. The
Reinard seeing the Lion to frown, &amp;
to grow in a great rage, because the
Hart had escaped him, did promise
the Lion to cause the Hart to come
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:5349:34"/>
backe againe. And vpon the matter,
he did so flatter the Hart with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sweet and sugred words, that he
drew him backe againe to the Lion,
to whom he doing reuerence as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the Lion seized vpon his horns,
and the other beasts falling also vpon
him, so as he was soone deuoured.
The Reinard pulling out his heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
did secretly eate it. Each of the beasts
sought very earnestly for his heart to
make a present of it to the king: but
the same not being to be found, the
blame was laid vpon the Renard with
great threats and stripes: Alas (quoth
the Reinard) I am wrongfully puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed:
for the Hart had no hart at all:
for if he had had any, he would neuer
haue returned to be slain and deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

The Nobleman answered: Sir, he is

Now sir, I haue not any more left

wisedome and vertue. And it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth

<hi>Conon</hi> (as it is often seene that

pleasure to be familiar with people
of meane reckening) with whome
taking his repast, he did vse diuerse

<hi>Conon</hi> (by the perswasion of his wife)
in hope to feele the bountie and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie

the fauour of the other.</p>
            <p>23 Frequent not the companie
of one and the same sort of men too
often: nor vse not to discourse too
long of one and the same matter: for
there is nothing but it may be tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and wearisome.</p>
            <p>24 Accustome thy selfe gladly
and willingly to endure things with
patience: to the intent thou maist the
better do it, when thou shalt be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to sufferance.</p>
            <p>25 Abstain from all such things
wherein thou shalt haue little or no
honestie to be exercised: as to be too
greedie and couetous of gaine, to be
cholericke, voluptuous, or melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie:
which thou shalt easily do, if
thou esteeme it gaine to get honour
rather then riches: &amp; if thou vse cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
against those that offend thee, as
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:5349:129"/>
thou wouldest that others should vse
it towards thee if thou shouldest of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
them: and as thou iudgest it not
seemely to be commaunded of thy
seruants: so is it not fit that thou shol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
be subiect to thy affections. And
last of all, endure with patience and
constancie misfortunes and aduersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
and fixing thine eye and regard
vpon the miseries of other men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that thou thy selfe also art a
man.</p>
            <p>26 Be more carefull to keep thy
word and promise, then the money
which is committed to thee in trust:
for honest and good men ought so
to gouerne themselues, that men
should haue more confidence on
their honestie, then in their oath.</p>
            <p>27 There is no lesse reason for
a man to be distrustful of the wicked
then to giue credite to such as are
good and vertuous.</p>
            <p>28 Reueale not thy secret to any
person liuing, vnlesse they to whom
thou shalt disclose it, haue as great
reason to conceale it in silence, as
thou hast to impart it vnto them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:5349:130"/>
29 When thou shalt be enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to take an oath, thou oughtest
for two reasons to accept of it: either
to cleare and purge thy selfe of some
villanous actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that may be obiected
vnto thee: or to preserue and saue thy
friends from daunger.</p>
            <p>30 Sweare not in any case for
lucre or desire of money, although
thou haue iust occasion to take an
oath: for in so doing, thou shalt be
esteemed of some little better then a
periured person: and of others thou
shalt be held a man wretchedly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous.</p>
            <p>31 Neuer make choise of anie
man for thy friend, of whome thou
hast not first gotten some informatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
how he hath vsed his friends before
times: and be thou very well assured
that he will proue such towards thee,
as he hath bene before towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>32 Enter not suddenly or too ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stily
into amitie with any man: and
yet after thou hast once professed thy
selfe to be a friend, perseuer in his
friendship (if it be possible) vnto the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:5349:130"/>
end. For as little honestie it is vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man to be without friends, as to
chaunge them and to make choise of
new often.</p>
            <p>33 Make not trial of thy friends
with losse: and yet trie them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times:
the which thou maist do, if not
hauing need of them, &amp; before time
of necessitie, thou do faine and make
shew as though thou hadst neede of
them.</p>
            <p>34 Communicate thy affaires
which thou wouldest haue knowne,
as if thou haddest a pretence and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to keepe them secret: for if they
(to whome thou shalt impart them)
do conceale them, thou canst not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
any dammage by their secrecy:
but if they do reueale them: then hast
thou good proofe and triall of their
manners and conditions, and thou
maist afterwards take heed of them.</p>
            <p>35 There is no meane so ready
for a man to know his friends, as in
the middest of the misfortunes of
this mortall life: and by the helpe &amp;
succours which they affoord a man
in his affaires. The former maketh a
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:5349:131"/>
triall of them as gold is tried by the
fire: and by the latter a man shall
know how to trust his friends in time
of neede.</p>
            <p>36 He that preuenteth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
and intreatie of his friend, and
succoureth him in time before he be
required, perfourmeth the true dutie
and deuoire of perfect amitie.</p>
            <p>37 Perswade thy selfe that it is
no lesse indignitie to be surmounted
in benefites by thy friends, then it is
to suffer them to be ouerborne with
the iniuries of their enemies.</p>
            <p>38 Receiue into thy amitie not
onely those which haue compassion
of thy aduersities, but them also
which are not enuious of thy prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.
For there are many who will
condole the misfortunes of their
friends, and yet afterwards when they
see them in prosperitie, will enuie
their good fortune.</p>
            <p>39 Vse to talke often of thy
friends which are absent, before them
that are present: to the intent they
may perceiue and be perswaded, that
thou wilt not be forgetfull of them
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:5349:131"/>
likewise, when they shall be absent
and farre away from thee.</p>
            <p>40 Let the furniture and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of thy person be fit and suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for thine honour, but not too cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious:
for the one is seemely and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting
a man of great estate and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificence:
the other appertaineth to
persons effeminate, and such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in superfluitie.</p>
            <p>41 Esteeme not of those, who
haue care of nothing else then to
heape vp riches, not being able to
vse them: they are like to those men
that haue goodly horses, and know
not how to ride them.</p>
            <p>42 Spare not to get riches; yet
so, as thou do not only seeke to haue
the possession of them, but that thou
labour also to haue the true vse of
them: for the true fruition of riches
yeeldeth pleasure vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that know
how to take it: and the possession of
them serueth vnto those that can
rightly vse them.</p>
            <p>43 Esteeme of goods for two
reasons: the one that thou maist by
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:5349:132"/>
their meanes free thy selfe from an
inconuenience: the other that thou
maist be able to succour and helpe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
honest man thy friend in time of
his necessitie.</p>
            <p>44 Care not to attaine to that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
and kind of life, which being
excessiue and superfluous, is vsed by
other men: but regard the mean and
moderate estate.</p>
            <p>45 Grieue not nor trouble thy
selfe at thy estate and condition pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
but labour to amend and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it.</p>
            <p>46 Neuer reproch any man with
his miserie and calamitie: for asmuch
as the like fortune is common to all
in generall: and there is no man that
knoweth what will befall him.</p>
            <p>47 Succour and releeue the good
in their time of need: for this is a
great treasure, to do good vnto those
that are vertuous, and to bind them
vnto thee by thy benefites.</p>
            <p>48 He that doth good vnto the
wicked, is like vnto him that giueth
meate vnto another mans dogges:
for they barke aswell at him as at
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:5349:132"/>
others whom they meete: and euen
so do the wicked men vse to wrong
and iniurie those that releeue them,
as others that do trouble and hurt
them.</p>
            <p>49 Abhorre flatterers no lesse
then common cousiners: for both of
them do exceedingly deceiue such as
haue any trust or confidence in them.</p>
            <p>50 If thy friends do not aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and forsake thee in euil matters,
much more reason will they haue to
aide thee in all good actions.</p>
            <p>51 Let thy cariage and behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
be familiar, and not too graue
and austere towards those that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
with thee. For seruants can
hardly beare the haughtinesse and
pride of their maisters: and all sorts
of people, do gladly fashion and
frame themselues to conuerse with
those that are priuate and familiar
with them. The way to be accounted
companiable, is: not to be quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
troublesome, nor contentious:
and moreouer, that thou do not too
rudely crosse thy friend in his choler,
(although he haue growne into it
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:5349:133"/>
vpon a wrong occasion) but rather
yeeld and giue way vnto him during
his anger: and when it is ouerpast,
reprehend him friendly</p>
            <p>52 Affect not nor accustome thy
selfe to grauitie in trifling matters,
nor trifle not in matters of grauitie
and importance: for whatsoeuer is
done out of season is troublesome
and tedious.</p>
            <p>53 Be not vnpleasing in doing
of a pleasure to any man: as we see
many vse to do, who know not how
to do a pleasure to their friends with
a good and gracious countenance.</p>
            <p>54 It is a very troublesome thing
to be giuen to be quarrellous: and
for any man to studie and beate his
braines how to reproue another, doth
but incense and irritate men.</p>
            <p>55 Gouerne thy selfe with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
and modestie in thy drinke:
but if it happen that thou fall into
companie, arise and depart rather
then be ouercome with drinking: for
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the spirit is possessed with wine,
it is like vnto a chariot or coach hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
which hauing ouerthrowne their
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:5349:133"/>
coachman, do runne here and there
without all order, hauing none to
guide and direct them: so is the soule
of a man very much offended, when
the vnderstanding is distempered and
troubled.</p>
            <p>56 Propo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>und vnto thy self things
immortal, as a man of courage and
magnanimitie: &amp; vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mortall things
so set thy affections, as thou do vse
thy goods which thou hast with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
and modestie.</p>
            <p>57 Knowledge ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before ignorance for many
reasons, and especially for that in all
other things which are odious, yet
there is some profite to be found: but
ignorance onely is euer noysome &amp;
hurtful to the ignorant, &amp; doth make
them beare the paine of those offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which they commit, euen in spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ill of others. When thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
win the friendship and loue of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one, speake well of him vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
who may make report thereof vnto
him.</p>
            <p>58 The beginning of friendship
is praise &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation: &amp; the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:5349:134"/>
of emnitie and hatred, is detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and contempt.</p>
            <p>59 When thou wilt consult vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
any case, take example by that which
is past vpon that which is to come:
for it is easie to vnderstand that which
is obscure &amp; vncertain by that which
hath bene formerly manifest and
certaine.</p>
            <p>60 Be not too hastie in thy deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations:
but when thou hast resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
vpon any enterprize, put it spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
in execution.</p>
            <p>61 Thinke that the greatest bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
that can befall thee from God,
is to enioy true felicitie: and that the
greatest good that can light vpon
thee by thine owne industrie, is good
counsell.</p>
            <p>62 When thou doubtest with
hardinesse to vndertake any matter,
communicate the same with thy
friends, and conferre with them vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
it, making shew as if it were some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mans case: in so doing thou shalt
know their opinion without discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
thy owne secrets.</p>
            <p>63 When thou wilt deliberate
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:5349:134"/>
of any matter of importance with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
consider first how he hath
caried himselfe in the like affaires of
his owne: for it is very vnlikely that
he which hath ill managed his owne
proper businesse, can well and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
dispatch the affaires of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>64 There is nothing that doth
more incite a man to bethinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
for the good ordering of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
then to regard the losses and
dammage which he hath formerly
receiued by his own indiscretion: for
it is commonly seene, that we are
more carefull of our health, when we
call to memorie the extreame do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
which we haue suffered in time
of our sicknesse.</p>
            <p>65 Follow the manners &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of Princes, and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
thy selfe to their manner of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing:
for in so doing, thou shalt bring
them to thinke that their doings are
to thy liking: whereof it will ensue,
that thou shalt both purchase more
authoritie and estimation amongst
the people: and thou shalt be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:5349:135"/>
assured to stand in the good grace
and fauour of thy Prince.</p>
            <p>66 Be obedient to the Edicts &amp;
Ordinances made by Princes: with
this opinion notwithstanding, that
there is no law which hath so much
strength and efficacie as their liues:
for as it is very requisite for those that
are gouerned by a popular estate, to
honour the people: so it behoueth
him that liueth vnder a Monarchie,
to admire and reuerence his Prince.</p>
            <p>67 Whensoeuer thou shalt be
aduanced to any dignitie, in any case
vse not the aide and assistance of such
as are wicked in any charge or affairs
of consequence whatsoeuer: because
the blame of all the mischiefe and
wickednesse by them committed,
shall be imputed continually vnto
thee.</p>
            <p>68 Whensoeuer thou leauest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
place of publike charge, do it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a good credite and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then with the request of great
wealth and riches: for the praise and
commendations of the people ought
to be preferred farre before riches.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:5349:135"/>
69 Take heed that thou giue
no aide nor assistance to any wicked
action, nor that thou countenance
the same with thy company: for the
faults of those whom thou fauourest
will be imputed vnto thee as thine
owne.</p>
            <p>70 So carrie thy selfe in thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauior,
as thou maist be alwaies sure
to haue the aduantage and prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
aboue others: yet so neuer the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
as thou euer embrace equitie: to
the intent that men may thinke thee
to loue and embrace iustice, not for
want of power to do wrong, but of
pure loue to honestie and modestie.</p>
            <p>71 It is farre better to be poore
and honest, then to be rich and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
For certainely iustice is better
then riches: because the latter is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
profitable to men liuing: but the
former maketh a man to be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
euen after his decease. Besides,
adde hereunto: that riches are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
distributed and bestowed vpon
wicked and leud persons, who cannot
in any sort notwithstanding partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
of vertue and iustice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:5349:136"/>
72 Be not a follower of those
that seeke to enrich themselues by
vnlawfull and vniust gaine: but of
those rather, who can be content to
sustaine losse so they may be reputed
honest and good men: for admit that
iust men haue no other aduantage or
preheminence aboue the wicked: yet
herein at least do they surmount the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
in that they haue good and vertuous
hopes.</p>
            <p>73 Haue a care to embrace all
that which concerneth the life of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
but principally and aboue all, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
prudence: for it is not a thing of
small reck ening, for a man to haue a
bodie endowed and beautified with
a mind of good vnderstanding.</p>
            <p>74 Accustome thy bodie to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
&amp; trauell, &amp; thy mind to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and learning: to the intent that
by the meane and helpe of the one,
thou maist be able to execute that
which shall seeme good vnto thee: &amp;
by the aide of the other, thou maist
foresee that which shall be for thy
profite and commoditie.</p>
            <p>75 Bethinke thy selfe well of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:5349:136"/>
that which thou art to speake: for of
tentimes the toung runneth before
the thought.</p>
            <p>76 Esteeme not any thing in
this world to be stable and certaine:
for so shalt thou not reioyce ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
in thy prosperitien, or waxe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
sad or dismayed with aduersitie.</p>
            <p>77 There be two occasions wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thou maist freely and boldly speak
thy mind: the first is, in things which
thou knowest perfectly &amp; assuredly:
the other is, in matters that do neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
concerne thee: in both which,
it is more expedient for thee to speak
liberally, then to be silent or say little.
As concerning al other matters, it is
farre better to be silent, then to talke
of them.</p>
            <p>78 Take thy honest pleasure and
recreation of any thing that is good:
and whatsoeuer euill befalleth thee,
endure and beare it quietly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly.</p>
            <p>79 Be close and secret to thy vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost
in any thing that concerneth
thee: for it is small wisedome, and to
little purpose, to keepe thy wealth
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:5349:137"/>
streight locked vp within thy house:
and to haue thy mind laid open to
the world.</p>
            <p>80 It behooueth any man of
discretion to feare reproch more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
any daunger whatsoeuer.</p>
            <p>81 Death is fearefull and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to faint hearted and wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
but the good &amp; vertuous ought
not to feare any thing but dishonour
and ignominie.</p>
            <p>82 It is good for a man to liue
in the greatest assurance that he can
possibly: howbeit, if he be constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to hazard and aduenture himself,
it is more fit that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tend &amp; striue
with it honestly, then to shun &amp; flye
from it shamefully, considering that
we are all destinated to die: but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath onely ordained and framed
them that are vertuous to dye vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
and couragiously.</p>
            <p>And now to conclude, if thou find
that most of these precepts are nor fit
and agreable to thy age, maruell not
hereat: for I my selfe do thinke no
lesse: notwithstanding I thought it
not amisse by one and the same
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:5349:137"/>
meane, both to giue thee counsel for
the time present, and to leaue thee
also precepts for the time to come:
wherein thou maiest with more faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
know what is most fit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
to be vsed: for thou shalt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hardly find any man that wil coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
thee friendly and faithfully, and
therefore I was not willing to omit
any thing, which I thought would be
for thy profi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: to the intent thou shol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
not be driuen, to borrow ought
of others: but here to find of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost
whatsoeuer shall be fit to serue
thy turne. And I shall hold my selfe
also much bounden to thanke God,
when I shallsee that I am not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of that good opinion which I
haue conceiued of you. For euen as
it is a common thing with men, to
delight themselues in things which
are pleasant, rather then such as are
wholesome: so do they more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
conuerse with such as are of
corrupt behauiour, and like vnto
themselues, then with those that seek
to correct and amend them of their
ill dispositions. Neuertheles I thinke
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:5349:138"/>
that thou wilt be of a contrarie opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
if thou do but take a coniecture
of the labour and trouble which
thou shalt endure by addicting thy
selfe to the studie of other disciplines.
For it is very likely, that he which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth
himselfe to do good and
vertuous acts, will willingly giue eare
to others who exhort him vnto ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
Now there is no better meane
to incite and prouoke thee to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
laudable deedes and actions,
then to consider how the true plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and contentment reaped by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
doth still continue and abide with vs:
and on the contrarie, how idlenesse
and deliciousnesse doth soone grow
wearisome and tedious: adde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall,
that voluptuous pleasures are
alwaies accompanied with troubles
and molestations: but to trauell for
vertue, and to liue soberly, bringeth
with it true pleasure, and such as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
durable. I deny not but that in
the beginning voluptuousnesse may
yeeld vnto a man some pleasure and
delectation, howbeit sorrow &amp; grief
doth soone ouertake it. but in vertue
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:5349:138"/>
after great labours and trauels com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
true rest, contentment and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
pleasure. Now certaine it is that
in all our affaires we haue more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the issue and end thereof, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to the beginning: and we do in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
estimate all our actions by their
euents. Moreouer, it is to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
how the wicked are neuer at a
stay of their wicked actions, but do
continue in that fashion and manner
of life which they haue taken at the
beginning: and the vertuous do hold
it in no sort lawfull to leaue vertue,
vnlesse they will wholly yeeld them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to be a scorne and reproofe to
the whole world: for this is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that men do not so much hate
them that are notoriously vicious, as
those which boast themselues to be
good and vertuous, when indeede
they are nothing different from the
common and worst sort. Now if we
do blame lyers for their leasings,
much more reason haue we to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
them, which in the whole
course of their liues are depraued and
corrupted: who do not onely therein
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:5349:139"/>
offer wrong vnto themselues, but do
(as it were) betray that good fortune
which is put into their hands, euen
riches, honour, and aboundance of
friends: and yet neuerthelesse do
make themselues vnworthie of their
present felicitie. Furthermore, if ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
which is mortal, would but seeke to
obserue and regard the will of the
immortall Gods, I suppose he should
easily and euidently know and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it: because euen in those that
were most neare and deare vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
they haue testified and made known
what difference they make betweene
the vertuous and the vicious. For <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>
hauing ingendred both <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi>
and <hi>Tantalus,</hi> is said to haue made
the one immortall for his vertue, and
to haue condemned the other to
grieuous punishment and torments
for his leud life and wickednesse.</p>
            <p>In imitation therefore of these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
it is fit and conuenient for
men to loue honestie, and to follow
vertue: and not onely to relye vpon
these precepts, but to learne also the
most choise ensignements of the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:5349:139"/>
most famous and excellent Poets, &amp;
to reade the writings of other good
Authours. And as the Bees flying &amp;
lighting on all sorts of flowers, do
take of each that which is fit and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for honie: so it behooueth them
that desire knowledge and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
to leaue nothing that good is
vnprooued, and to make profit of all
that commeth to their knowledge:
and yet when they haue vsed all and
their vttermost diligence to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
it will be very hard and difficult
notwithstanding to correct the vices
and imperfections of nature.</p>

which is couetous of glorie, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth

6 A question was demaunded
by one on a time, why &amp; vpon what
occasion the Lacedemonians did vse
so great breuitie in their language:
whereunto <hi>Licurgus</hi> made this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer:
that breuitie of speech is next
vnto silence.</p>
               <p>7 We ought to haue great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
that we speake not things not
fit and conuenient: because that it is
the office and dutie of a man of smal
wisedome to speake and vtter those
things which ought to be kept secret.</p>
               <p>8 A man ought to chuse rather
foolishly to rowle and tosse a stone
vp and downe in vaine, then to
speake any one idle and vaine word.</p>
               <p>9 <hi>Solon</hi> being set at table with
<hi>Periander</hi> the tyrant of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and
not vsing any speech, was demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of the tyrant, if his silence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
either through default of
knowledge how to speake, or else of
follie. Whereunto <hi>Solon</hi> gaue him
this present answer: That he is no
foole that can be silent in a banquet.</p>
               <p>10 <hi>Solon</hi> the Philosopher did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish
men to seale &amp; shut vp their
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:5349:155"/>
words vnder silence: and that silence
ought to be vsed and obserued accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the fitnes of the time &amp; seaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>11 <hi>Isocrates</hi> said: that there were
two speciall times wherin it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for any man to speake without
reprehension: the one, when we speak
of things which we know certainely
and manifestly: the other, when we
speake of things needfull and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie.
In these two times onely speech
is better then silence: but at other
times silence is to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
speech.</p>
               <p>12 It is a rare vertue to know how
and when to be silent.</p>
               <p>13 It is a most miserable thing
when a man is constrained perforce
to keepe secret those things which he
would gladly and willingly vtter and
make knowne.</p>

               <p>13 True nobilitie is to relye v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

               <p>14 Magnanimitie and greatnes

spirit and magnanimitie, who both is
and esteemeth himselfe worthie of
great things: and he which in his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
doth not carrie himselfe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

               <p>16 There be foure sorts of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie

               <p>9 It is requisite that the good be
stirred vp to vertue by praise and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,

               <p>10 It is a thing very vnfit and

               <p>13 No man can be good by the

               <p>7 To giue more honour to a

way to fooles both to perceiue and
to thinke ill.</p>
               <p>8 In my opinion it is an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
action, to accuse the wicked, &amp;

               <p>9 Honour ought to be gotten

               <p>3 It must be of necessitie, that
all things which angry men do, must

because it is no easie matter
for a man troubled with anger, to

and hauing in the middest of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
heard tidings of the death of
his sonne, was not any thing at all

disputation was ended, he then said
vnto those which were with him:
Come on, let vs now go and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie

               <p>14 <hi>Xantippe</hi> the wife of <hi>Socrates</hi>

countenance of her husband <hi>Socrates</hi>
for any matter euer changed or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled:
but that he continued still one
and the selfe same man in all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.
And indeede <hi>Socrates</hi> did so
frame his mind, that he alwaies bore
his visage in one sort, as well in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie
as prosperitie.</p>
               <p>15 As <hi>Xenophon</hi> was sacrificing
in the citie of <hi>Mantinea.</hi> there came
a missenger to bring him tidings how
his sonne <hi>Grillus</hi> was dead: vpon the
receipt of which newes, he presently
tooke the crowne from off his head
without further interrupting of the
sacrisice. But the messenger hauing
added this vnto his tale, that his sonne
died victoriously, he tooke vp the
crown &amp; set it againe vpon his head,
&amp; so went on with the finishing of his

               <p>1 THe Poet <hi>Simonides</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded,
which of these two
things he had rather choose, either
riches or wisedome: answered. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell whether: but certaine it is,
that I see wise men euer attending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the gates of rich men.</p>
               <p>2 It is a thing most requisite &amp;
necessarie for a man to haue money:
without which it is impossible to do
or effect any thing with oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
or in time conuenient.</p>
               <p>3 Money amongst mortall men
is as the bloud and the soule of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
and he which hath it not, is as one
that walketh dead amongst the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</p>
               <p>4 Onely gold and riches esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisheth
customes and manners: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
and giueth beautie, nobilitie,
friendship, and all other things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer.</p>
               <p>5 Ha father, speake not to me
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:5349:172"/>
of gentrie or nobilitie, for it relyeth
altogether vpon wealth and riches:
giue me my house stored with gold:
and if I were left a slane, I shall then
soone become and be reputed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>6 Mony is it that findeth friends,
and bringeth men into fauour and
dignitie neare about Princes.</p>
               <p>7 Riches are the sure friends:
but they which are commonly repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for friends, do soone forsake him
which is poore.</p>
               <p>8 Great riches are to be bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <p>9 I see it is an ordinarie humor

sure to employ thy riches very well,
and in better sort then all other kings
vse to do, if thou bestow them vpon

               <p>11 Riches do hurt exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

a man shold not put a knife in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a childs hand: and I say, that thou
shouldst neither giue him knife nor
yet riches.</p>
               <p>2 Esteeme not of those men,
whose hearts are wholly set vpon the
riches which they possesse: because
not knowing how to vse them, they
are to be held like vnto those men
that haue a faire and goodly horse,
but know not how to ride nor ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
him.</p>
               <p>3 Riches are most commonly
made the ministers and instruments
of vices rather then of vertues: and
they entice and allure young persons
to foolish voluptuousnesse.</p>
               <p>4 The Poet <hi>Anacreon</hi> hauing had
fiue talents bestowed vpon him by
the tyrant <hi>Policrates:</hi> &amp; for two nights
after hauing bene very sad &amp; pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>siue,
&amp; not able to sleepe or take his rest,
caried him back again his fiue tale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
saying vnto him: this mony is not to
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:5349:173"/>
be valued or prized at so high a rate:
as that for the same, I should suffer
my selfe to be disquieted with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
care and pensiuenesse.</p>
               <p>5 It is a very hard thing natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for a man to refraine and bridle his
appetites but if it happen to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with aboundance of

vtterly vntameable.</p>
               <p>6 <hi>Bion</hi> the Philosopher said; that
it was a thing meerely ridiculous, for

riches which are giuen and gotten
onely by fortune, by miserable spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

               <p>7 <hi>Diogenes</hi> was wont to say: that

life, answered: First, to be free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie:
that he come not to be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
by treason: and next, that he
be not in too great needinesse and
necessitie of things necessarie.</p>
               <p>10 Riches do commonly seduce
and draw a man out of the right
way.</p>
               <p>11 He that putteth his trust in
his riches, is in the high way to ruine
and destruction.</p>
               <p>12 As riches are but impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to those that are wicked: so to
good men they giue an aide and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
to their vertues.</p>
               <p>13 It is most certaine, that it is
impossible for any man to be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
both in riches and in goodnesse.</p>
               <p>14 Rich men are called monyed
men: but if they be couetous, they
are poore in their thoughts: and so
likewise the poore are named needy

they are rich, (if they be contented.)</p>
               <p>15 The Cinicke Philosophers

               <p>3 The kings of <hi>Persia</hi> before

               <p>4 The <hi>Atlanticke</hi> peoples of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi>

               <p>5 The <hi>Autyles</hi> a people of <hi>Lybia</hi>

               <p>8 Those lawes which grow and

certaine auncient lawes remaining in

It is necessarie that the lawes should

               <p>14 They which haue too many

               <p>15 The true lawes are those that

               <p>8 There are 3. good things in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage:
linage, faith, &amp; a sacrament.</p>

10 Chastitie in a woman is the
fortresse and bulwarke of her beauty.</p>
               <p>11 To be gouerned by the wife,
is an exceeding great iniurie to the
honour &amp; reputation of the husband.</p>
               <p>12 Like as the worme eateth out
the wood: so doth the ill wife con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
the husband.</p>
               <p>13 It is much better to dwell in
the common high way, then to abide
in a house with a wife full of words.</p>
               <p>14 Hell, the loue of a woman,
the drye earth, and the fire, are neuer
satisfied, nor euer crie, ho.</p>
               <p>15 <hi>Martia</hi> the daughter of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi>
being a widow, was demaunded
why she did not marry againe. Her
answer was: Because I cannot find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
man, that had rather haue me
then my goods.</p>
               <p>16 To nourish or maintaine a
poore wife is a thing very difficult,
but to endure a rich wife is a hellish
torment.</p>
               <p>17 <hi>Theana</hi> a Greeke Ladie of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
fame and memorie, by chance
on a time drawing vp her smocke so
high ouer her arme as she shewed
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:5349:195"/>
her naked elbow: One standing by
said vnto her: Oh what a faire white
arme is there! to whome she answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
and yet for all that it is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
open: and in truth it is very
requisite that not onely the elbow of
a chast woman should not be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
but secret in her speech likewise.</p>
               <p>18 The wife of <hi>Philo</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded,
why she did not weare
iewels at the publike feasts, answered:
It sufficeth me that I haue for my or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
the vertue of my husband.</p>
               <p>19 <hi>Cato</hi> the elder condemned a
Senatour to be banished, because he
had kissed his owne wife in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of his daughter.</p>
               <p>20 Euen as the mirror or glasse
doth not yeeld any more profit, in
being set out and garnished with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
stones, or with gold and siluer,
if it do not perfectly represent the
forme that is presented vnto it: So a
rich wife is little woorth or of small
estimate, if her life and behauiour
be not sutable and conuenient to the
customes and fashions of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>

21 Those husbands which will
not recreate and sport themselues,
drinke, laugh, and make merrie, and
vse other amiable pleasures with their
owne wiues: it is signe that they
will seeke and take their secret solace
by stealth with other women.</p>
               <p>22 We see that the Moone is
most bright and cleare shining, when
she is far off from the Sunne: and
when she is neare it she becommeth
obscure, and her light is darkened:
but a good wife is of a contrarie qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
because her husband being in
place, she careth not to be seene of
euery bodie: but when he is away,
she keepeth her selfe priuate, &amp; shut

               <p>23 The lawful wiues of the kings
of <hi>Persia,</hi> were accustomed to sit at

24 A yong woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Sparta</hi> being
questioned by one to tell him if she
had euer intreated the companie of
any man: she answered him, no truly:
but a man is welcome vnto me: tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
thereby all honest women not
to be desirous to seek their pleasures,
but to attend til their husbands come
to offer it them.</p>
               <p>25 The husband that taketh a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light

               <p>26 The foundation of all femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine

               <p>27 Necessitie is a most disloyall
gardian, and keeper of the chastitie
of women.</p>
               <p>28 Many women care not though

most skilfull in all wicked subtleties.</p>
               <p>29 The death of the husband
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:5349:196"/>
doth not cut off the loue of a chaste

               <p>30 The woman is more subiect
to loue then the man.</p>
               <p>31 That bed is full of disquiet and

               <p>34 Some women do more gladly
reade things that are lasciuious then
such as are honest.</p>
               <p>35 A woman is (as it were) a briefe

hauing in one day many good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
befallen him, said: O fortune
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:5349:197"/>
for these so great and notable good
fortunes, graunt me that I may haue
but one vnfortunate day.</p>
               <p>4 In all aduersities and misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
the most vnhappie condition
of the vnfortunate, is to remember
that once he was happie.</p>
               <p>5 The Poet <hi>Ion</hi> said: that fortune
and wisedome being two diuerse and
farre different things, did make not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
and bring foorth most
like and semblable effects: because
both the one &amp; the other did exalt,
adorne, and lift men vp to the
highest degree of glorie.</p>
               <p>6 The goods of fortune are such,
as a man hath neede of reason for the
vse of things, and of patience in the
necessitie of them.</p>
               <p>7 He which is ashamed of his

               <p>11 It seldome happeneth but that

               <p>12 No man ought to refuse that

               <p>17 The publike wealth is the

               <p>23 When thou shalt be placed

be euer conuersant about the

affections and the actions, in which
consisteth much, little and a meane.
It many times falleth out, that we
feare one more and another lesse: that
one is confident, another desireth:
one is fierce, and another is angry &amp;

when it is needful, and to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and for what occasion, and how. But
mediocritie is the best, the which of
it selfe properly is the true vertue:
Then vertue is an habite of election
which consisteth in the meane, which
men call mediocritie.</p>
               <p>2 I haue made search if it be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for a man to know those things
which are manifest in vertue: but I
could neuer yet find them.</p>
               <p>3 It appertaineth vnto the vertue
of the sexe feminine to gouerne the

matters, and to be obedient to
her husband.</p>
               <p>4 Force, wisedome, temperance,

she is accustomed to reioyce

               <p>9 Nature cannot establish any

               <p>10 To die continually for vertue,

               <p>1 FElicitie is the end of all things
which are to be desired. Some
haue said, that felicitie is prosperitie
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:5349:208"/>
of fortune: and some say vertue: but
it is fit and conuenient, that felicitie
be giuen from the Gods. The felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the soule, is an operation per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by vertue.</p>
               <p>2 Vertue commeth of science,
and of vertue proceedeth the soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
good: what can this soueraign
and chiefe good be, but God &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
whence our soule is deriued?</p>
               <p>3 The soueraigne good of the
soule is to be like vnto God.</p>
               <p>4 This is felicitie (as saith <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>)
which is not consisting in one
onely art, but in all the course of a
perfect life.</p>
               <p>5 They are truely happie which
are with truth: but they which liue in
vanitie cannot be happie.</p>
               <p>6 Some by too great felicitie,
care nothing for God at all.</p>
               <p>7 To happy men, the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of miseries seemeth to be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
streight and difficult thing.</p>
               <p>8 To be happie, is to liue well
and to do well.</p>
               <p>9 No man can be happie, but
he that is wise and good. It followeth
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:5349:208"/>
then that wicked men are miserable:
and therefore not the rich man but
the prudent man flyeth and shunneth
miserie.</p>
               <p>10 Felicitie is deuided into fiue
parts. The first is, to take good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell:
the second is, to haue the sences
strong and sound, &amp; to be of a good
disposition of bodie: the third is, to
be fortunate in all actions: the fourth
to be alwaies neare and in companie
with men excellent in glorie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne:
the fifth is to abound in
wealth and all other such things as
serue for the necessitie of mans life.</p>
               <p>11 Happie are they that haue a
good soule: and that is giuen them

               <p>12 Felicitie is either by destiny,
or of fortune, or of vertue.</p>
               <p>13 As sicke men cannot tast the

man attaine to happinesse and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
