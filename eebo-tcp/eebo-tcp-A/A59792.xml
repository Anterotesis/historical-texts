            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A BRIEF
DISCOURSE
Concerning the
Notes of the CHURCH, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IF Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi> had not told us, That this
is a <hi>most profitable Controversie;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Controv. T2. L. 4. de Notic Ecclesiae.</note> I should very
much have wondered at that pains which he
and so many other of their great Divines have
taken, to find out the Notes of the Church. For
is not the Catholick Church visible? And if we can see
which is this Church, what need we guess at it by marks
and signs? and that by such marks and signs too, as are
matter of dispute themselves? Cannot we distinguish
between the Christian Church, and a <hi>Turkish</hi> Mosque,
or <hi>Jewish</hi> Synagogue, or Pagan Temple? Cannot we,
without all this ado, distinguish a Christian from a <hi>Turk,</hi>
or a <hi>Jew,</hi> or a Pagan? And it will be as easie to find out
a Christian Church, as it is to find out Christians; for a
Christian Church is nothing else but a Society of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
united under Christian Pastors, for the Worship
of Christ; and where ever we find such a Society as
this, there is a Christian Church, and all such particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
or National Churches all the World over, make up
the whole Christian Church, or the Universal Church
of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:98208:3"/>
But this will not do the Cardinal's business; Though
the Christian Church is visible enough, yet not such a
Church as he wants. For since there are a great many
Christian Churches in the World, as the <hi>Greek,</hi> the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian,</hi>
the <hi>Abyssine,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, he would find
out which of these Churches is the Catholick Church;
which after all their shuffles they can never make any
better sense of, than which of the Parts is the Whole.</p>
            <p>Since there are many unhappy disputes among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
the use of Notes is to find out an Infallible
Church, which must by an indisputable authority di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate
to all other Churches, what they must believe,
and what they must practise; and to bring all other
Churches into subjection, they must find out a Church,
out of whose Communion there is no pardon of sin, no
Eternal life to be had. That is, in short, the use of Notes
is to prove the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the only Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, the only Infallible Oracle of Faith, and
final Judg of Controversies; and that the promises of
Pardon of Sin, and Eternal Life, are made only to the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to those other Churches which
are in subjection to her. Thus <hi>Bellarmine</hi> unriddles
this matter, that the usefulness of this Inquiry after the
Notes of the true Church, is, because <hi>in the true Church
only there is the true Faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Omnes enim confitentur in solâ verâ Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia esse ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram fidem, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram peccato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum remissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem, veram spem salutis aternâ. <hi>Bell.</hi> de Notis Eccl. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>the true remission of sins, the
true hope of eternal salvation;</hi> which is certainly true, that
all this is to be had only in the true Church of Christ.
For there can be no true Church without the true
Faith; and no remission of sins, nor hope of salvation
out of the true Church. But then all the Churches in the
World, which profess the true faith of Christ, are such true
Churches. But this will not do the business neither;
for it is not enough to know that every true Church
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98208:3"/>
professes the true Faith; but we must find out such a
Church, as cannot err in the Faith, and has authority
to correct the Faith of all other Churches; and we
must allow the pardon of sin, and eternal life, to be
had in no other Church but this; which is the only
thing, which can make such a Church the Mistress of
all other Churches; and this Church must be the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or else the Cardinal is undone with
all his Notes and Marks of the Church.</p>
            <p>The observing this, gives us the true state of this
Controversie; which is not, what it is which makes
a Church a true Church; which is necessary for all
Christians to know, that they may take care, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
be wanting in their Communion, which is essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to a true Church; which is the only use of Notes
that I know of: but the dispute is, how among all the
divisions of Christendom, we may find out that only
true Church, which is the Mistress of all other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
the only Infallible Guide in Matters of Faith, and
to which alone the promises of pardon and salvation
are made; and by some Notes and Characters of such
a Church, to prove, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is that
Church. The first of these is what the Protestants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
in those Notes they give of the true Church;
to show what it is which is essential to the being and
constitution of a Christian Church; for that, and
none else, is a true Church, which has all things essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to a true Church. The second is, what the <hi>Papists</hi>
intend by their Notes of a Church; to prove, that the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the only true Church: and some
brief remarks upon both these ways, will abundantly
serve for an Introduction to a more particular examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Notes of the Church,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98208:4"/>
which is the only design of these Papers.</p>
            <p>It is no wonder, that <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi> differ
so much about the Notes of the true Church, since
the questions, which each of them intend to answer by
their several Notes, so vastly differ. When you ask a
Protestant, What are the Notes of a true Church? He
answers to that question, What it is, which is essential
to a true Church; or what it is, which makes a Church
a true Church; that is, <hi>What a true Church is?</hi> And
examines the truth of his Church by the essential marks
and properties of a Church. When you ask a <hi>Papist</hi>
for Notes of a true Church, he answers to that question,
<hi>Which is a true Church?</hi> and thinks to point you out
to a true Church by some external marks and signs,
without ever inquiring what it is, which is essential to
a Church; and this he must of necessity do, according
to his principles; for he can know nothing of Religion
till he has found the Church, from which he must learn
every thing else. Let us consider then which of these
is most reasonable.</p>
            <p>First, To begin with the <hi>Protestant</hi> way of finding
out the Church by the essential properties of a true
Church; Such as the profession of the true Christian
Faith, and the Christian Sacraments rightly and duly
administred by persons rightly ordained, according to
the Institution of our Saviour, and the Apostolical pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise.
This is essential to a true Church; for there can
be no true Christian Church without the true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Faith, and Christian Sacraments, which cannot be
rightly administred but by Church-Officers rightly and
duly Ordained. The Regular Exercise of Discipline is
not necessary to the being of the Church, but to the
purity and good government of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:98208:4"/>
This is the sum of what the Protestants alledg for
the Notes of the true Church, and these are as infallible
Notes of a true Church, as Humane Nature is of a
man; for they are the Essential Principles of it. By
this every man may know whether he be a Member of
a true Church or not; for where this is, there is a true
Church; where this is not, there is no true Church,
whatever other marks of a Church there be. And I
know no other use of Notes, but to find out what we
seek for.</p>
            <p>In answer to such Notes as these, Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
objects Three things.</p>
            <p>1. That Notes, whereby we will distinguish things,
must not be common to other things, but proper and
peculiar to that of which it is a Note. As if you would
describe a man to me, whom I never saw, so as that I
may know him when I meet him; it is not enough to
say, that he has two Hands, or two Eyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because
this is common to all Men. And this he says is the
Fault of these Notes: For as for <hi>the sincere Preaching
of the Truth,</hi> or the Profession of the true Christian
Faith, this is common to all Sects, at least, in their own
Opinion; and the same may be said of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
All Sects and Professions of Christians, either
have the true Faith and Sacraments, or at least think
that they have so; and therefore these marks cannot vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
distinguish the true Church from any other Sect of
Christians.</p>
            <p>Now I must confess, these Notes, as he well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
are common to all Christian Churches, and
were intended to be so: and if this does not answer
his Design, we cannot help it. The Protestant
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98208:5"/>
Churches do not desire to confine the Notes of the
Church to their own private Communions; but are
very glad, if all the Churches in the World be as
true Churches as themselves. The whole Catholick
Church, which consists of a great many particular
Diocesan, or National Churches, has the same Nature;
And when the whole consists of univocal parts, every
part must have the same Nature with the whole: And
therefore as he who would describe a man, must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
him by such Characters as fit all Mankind; so he
who gives the Essential Characters of a Church, must
give such Notes as fit all true Churches in the
World. This indeed does not fit the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> to make it the only Catholick, and the only
true Church, nor do we intend it should; but it fits
all true Churches, wherever they are, and that is much
better.</p>
            <p>To answer then his Argument, when we give
Notes, which belong to a whole Species, as we must
do, when we give the Notes of a true Christian
Church; (there being a great many true Churches in
the World, which make up the Catholick, or Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Church) we must give such Notes as belong to the
whole kind; that is, to all true Christian Churches.
And though these Notes are common indeed to all
true Christian Churches, yet they are proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to a true Christian Church; as the Essential Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of a man are common to all men, but proper
to mankind: And this is necessary to make them true
Notes; For such Notes of a true Church, as do not fit
all true Churches, cannot be true Notes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:98208:5"/>
As for what the Cardinal urges, That all Sects
of Christians think themselves to have the true Faith,
and true Sacraments; I am apt to think they do;
but what then? If they have not the true Faith, and
true Sacraments, they are not true Churches, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they think of it; and yet the true Faith, and
true Sacraments, are certain Notes of a true
Church. A Purchase upon a bad Title, which a
man thinks a good one, is not a good Estate; but
yet a Purchase upon a Title, which is not only
thought to be, but is a good one, is a good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.
All that can be said in this case, is, That men
can be no more certain, that they have a true
Church, than they are, that they have a true
Faith, and true Sacraments; and this I readily
grant. But as mens mistakes in this matter, does not
prove, that there is no true Faith, nor true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
so neither does it prove, that a true Faith,
and true Sacraments, are not Notes of the true
Church.</p>
            <p>2. The Cardinal's second Objection is, That the
Notes of any thing must be more known than the
thing it self; which we readily grant. Now says
he, which is the true Church, is more knowable than
which is the true Faith: and this we deny, and that
for a very plain reason, because the true Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be known without knowing the true Faith: for
no Church is a true Church, which does not profess
the true Faith. We may as well say, that we can
know a Horse, without knowing what the shape and
figure of a Horse is, which distinguishes it from all
other Creatures, as that we can know a Christian
Church, without knowing what the Christian Faith
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98208:6"/>
is, which distinguishes it from all other Churches: or
we may as well say, that we can know any thing
without knowing what it is, since the very Essence of
a true Church consists in the true Faith, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must be first known before we can know the true
Church.</p>
            <p>But the Cardinal urges, that we cannot know what
true Scripture is, nor what is the true interpretation of
Scripture, but from the Church; and therefore we
must know the Church before we can koow the true
Faith. As for the first, I readily grant, that at this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from the writing the Books of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
there is no way to assure us, that they were
written by the Apostles, or Apostolical men, and
owned for inspired Writings, but the Testimony of the
Church in all Ages. But herein we do not consider
them as a Church, but as credible Witnesses. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be any such thing as a Church, or not, we
can know only by the Scriptures: But without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whether there be a Church or not, if we know,
that for so many Hundred years, these Books have
been owned to be written by such men, and have
been received from the Apostles days till now, by all
who call themselves Christians; this is as good an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical
Proof as we can have for any thing; and it is
the Authority of an uninterrupted Tradition, not the
Authority of the Church, considered as a Church,
which moves us to believe them: For setting aside
the Authority of Tradition, how can the Authority
of a Company of men, who call themselves the
Church, before I know whether there be any Church,
move me to believe any thing which was done 1600.
years a-go? But there is a Company of men in the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98208:6"/>
World, and have been successively for 1600. years
(whether they be a Church or not, is nothing to this
question), who assure me, that these Books, which we
call the Scriptures, were written by such inspired men,
and contain a faithful account of what Christ did, and
taught, and suffered; and therefore I believe such
Books: and from them I learn what that true Faith is
which makes a true Christian Church.</p>
            <p>As for the true interpretation of Scripture, that we
cannot understand what it is, without the Church,
this I also deny. The Scriptures are very intelligible
to honest and diligent Readers, in all things necessary
to salvation: and if they be not, I desire to know,
how we shall find out the Church: for certainly the
Church has no Character but what is in the Scripture:
and then if we must believe the Church before we can
believe or understand the Scriptures, we must believe
the Church, before we can possibly know whether
there be a Church or not. If we prove the Church
by the Scripture, we must believe and understand the
Scripture, before we can know the Church: If we
believe and understand the Scriptures upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Interpretation of the Church, considered
as a Church, then we must know the Church before
the Scripture. The Scripture cannot be known with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Church, nor the Church without the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and yet one of them must be known first, and
yet neither of them can be known first, according to
these Principles, which is such an absurdity, as all the,
Art of the World can never palliate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:98208:7"/>
3. The Cardinal's third Objection is, That the true
Notes of the Church must be inseparable from it;
whereas the Churches of <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Galatia</hi> did not
always teach true Doctrine, some of the Church of
<hi>Corinth</hi> denying the Resurrection, and the <hi>Galatians</hi>
warping towards <hi>Judaism;</hi> and the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi>
being guilty of great miscarriages in receiving
the Lords-Supper; and yet were owned for true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
by the Apostles. An argument which much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the Cardinal to use, it being the best evidence I
know of for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> being a true Church,
that every corruption in Faith and Sacraments do not
Unchurch; but how this proves that true Faith and
true Sacraments are not an essential note and character
of a true Church, I cannot guess: I would desire any
one to tell me for him, whether a corrupt Faith and
false Sacraments be the Notes of a true Church; or
whether it be no matter as to the nature of a Church,
what our Faith and Sacraments are?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Let us now consider the Cardinal's way,
by some certain marks and notes, to find out which
is the true Church, before we know what a true
Church is. To pick out of all the Churches in the
World, one Church, which we must own for the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true Church, and reject all other Churches, which
do not subject themselves to this one Church. To
find out such a Church on whose authority we must
rely for the whole Christian Faith; and in whose
Communion only pardon of sin is to be had. That
this is the use of Notes in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I
have already shewn you; and truly they are very
pretty things to be proved by Notes; as to consider
them particularly,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:98208:7"/>
1. To find out which is the true Church, before we
know what a true Church is. This methinks is not a
natural way of inquiry, but is like seeking for we know
not what. There are two inquiries in order of nature
before <hi>which is the true Church,</hi> viz. Whether there be
a true Church or not, and what it is. The first of these
the Cardinal takes for granted, that there is a Church;
but I wont take it for granted, but desire these Note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers
to give me some Notes to prove, that there
is a Church. There is indeed a great deal of talk and
noise in the World about a Church, but that is no
proof, that there is a Church; and yet it is not a self-evident
proposition, that there is a Church; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it must be proved. Now that there is a Church,
must be proved by Notes, as well as which is this true
Church, or else the whole design of Notes is lost; and
I would gladly see those Notes, which prove that
there is a Church, before we know what a Church is.
To understand the mystery of this, we must briefly
consider the reason and use of Notes in the Church
of <hi>Rome;</hi> according to the Popish resolution of Faith
into the authority of the Church; the first thing we
must know, is, which is the True Church; for we
must receive the Scriptures, and the Interpretation of
them, and the whole Christian Faith and Worship,
from the Church; and therefore can know nothing
of Religion, till we have found the Church. The use
then of Notes is to find out the Church before, and
without the Scriptures; for if they admit of a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-proof,
they must allow that we can know and
understand the Scriptures without the authority or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of the Church, which undermines the
very foundation of Popery: Now I first desire to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98208:8"/>
know how they will prove, That there is a Church
without the Scripture? That you'l say is visible it
self, for we see a Christian Church in the World;
but what is it I see? I see a company of men who call
themselves a Church, and this is all that I can see; and
is this seeing a Church? A Church must have a Divine
Original and Institution; and therefore, there is no
seeing a Church without seeing its Character; for
there can be no other Note or Mark of the being of a
Church, but the Institution of it.</p>
            <p>And this proves, that we cannot know, that there
is a Church, without knowing in some measure
what this Church is; for the Charter which founds
the Church, must declare the Nature and Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, what its Faith and Worship, and Laws and
Priviledges are. But now these essential Characters
of a Church must not be reckoned by the <hi>Romanists</hi>
among the Notes of a Church, for then we must
find out the true Church by the true Faith, and the
true Worship; not the true Faith by the true Church;
which destroys Popery.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that these Note-makers never attempt
to give us any Notes, whereby we shall know that
there is a Church, or what this Church is; for there
are no Notes of these, but such as they dare not give,
<hi>viz.</hi> The Authority of the Scriptures, and every mans
private judgment of the Sense and Interpretation of
them; for at least till we have found a Church, we
must judg for our selves, and then the Authority of
the Church comes too late; for we must first judg
upon the whole of Religion, if we must find out a
true Church by the true Faith, before we can know
the true Church; and we cannot rely on her Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98208:8"/>
before we know her; and therefore they take it
for granted, that there is a Church, which they can
never prove in their way, and attempt to give some
Notes whereby to know which is the Church; and
then learn, what the Church is, from the Church her
self; which is like giving marks whereby to know an
Unicorn, before I know whether there be an Unicorn
or not, or what it is.</p>
            <p>2. Another blunder in this Dispute about Notes is,
That they give us Notes whereby to find out the true
Catholick Church, before we know what a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Church is. For all <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Notes are intended
only for the Catholick Church; and therefore his
first Note is the <hi>name Catholick;</hi> whereas the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church is nothing else but all true Christian
Churches in the World, united together by one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Faith and Worship, and such acts of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
as distinct Churches are capable of, and obliged
to. Every particular Church which professes the
true Faith and Worship of Christ, is a true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Church; and the Catholick Church is all the true
Christian Churches in the World; which have all the
same Nature, and are in some sense of the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion:
So that it is impossible to know what the
Catholick Church is, before we know what a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Church is, as it is to know what the Sea is, before
we know what Water is: Every true, single, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Church has the whole and intire nature of a
Church, and would be a true Church, though there
were no other Church in the World; as the Christian
Church at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was, before any other Christian
Churches were planted; and therefore there can be
no other Notes of a True Church, but what belong
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98208:9"/>
to every true particular Church; and that can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what is essential to a Church, and what all
true Christian Churches in the World agree in, <hi>viz.</hi>
The True Faith and Worship of Christ.</p>
            <p>Now, so far as <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Notes belong to every
true particular Church, so far we allow them, and
let the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> make the best of them She
can; for we doubt not to make our claim to them,
as good, and much better than hers; but he has
named very few such; the <hi>6th,</hi> the Agreement and
Consent in Doctrine with the Ancient and Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church; and the <hi>8th</hi> the Holiness of its Doctrine,
are the cheif, if not the only Notes of this nature; and
these we will stand and fall by; many of his other,
are not properly the Notes of a true Church, any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
than as they are Testimonies of the truth of
common Christianity, which is professed by all true
Churches; and if they are Notes of the Church, so every
true particular Church has a share in them. Such as
his <hi>9th,</hi> the efficacy of Doctrine. The <hi>10th,</hi> the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the lives of the first Authors and Fathers of our
Religion; and I suppose, the Holiness of Christ and
his Apostles give Testimony to the truth of common
Christianity, and therefore to all Churches who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
the common Faith once delivered to the Saints.
The <hi>11th,</hi> the Glory of Miracles, which also proves
the truth of Christian Religion; and I hope a little
better than Popish Miracles do Transubstantiation. The
<hi>12th,</hi> is the Spirit of Prophesy, which as far as it is a
good Note, belongs to the Religion, not to the Church.
Other Notes he assigns, which I doubt will prove no
Notes at all, as 13, 14, 15. because they are not always
true, and at best uncertain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:98208:9"/>
His third and fourth Notes are not Notes of a
Church, but God's Promises made to his Church: as
of a long Duration, that it shall never fail, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude
or Extent, and multitude of Believers. These
Promises we believe God will fulfil to his Church, but
they can be no Notes, which is the true Church. For
the first of these can never be a Note till the day of
Judgment. That Church which shall never be destroyed
is the true Church, but a bare long continuance is no
Mark of a true Church; for an Apostatical Church
may continue by the patience and forbearance of God
many hundred Years, and be destroyed at last; and
then this Argument of a long Duration is confuted:
And as for Amplitude and Extent, that is not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
one Christian Church from another, that the
most numerous Church should be the truest; but to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
the Christian Church from all other Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and then I doubt this Prophecy has not received
its just Accomplishment yet; for tho we take in all the
Christian Churches in the World, and not exclude the
greatest part of them, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does,
yet they bear but a small proportion to the rest of the
World.</p>
            <p>And now there are but three of his fifteen Notes of
the Church left. The first concerning the Name <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,</hi>
which makes every Church a Catholick Church,
which will call it self so: Tho Catholick does not
declare what a Church is, but in what Communion it
is, and is no Note of a true Church, unless it be first
proved, that they are true Churches, which are in
Communion with each other: For if three parts in
four of all the Churches in the World were very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
and degenerate in Faith and Worship, and were
in one Communion, this would be the most Catholick
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98208:10"/>
Communion, as Catholick signifies the most general
and universal; but yet the fourth part, which is sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
would be the best and truest Church, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, as that signifies the Communion of all
Orthodox and Pure Churches.</p>
            <p>His first Note is, <hi>the Succession of Bishops in the Church
of</hi> Rome <hi>from the Apostles till now.</hi> This is a Note of
the Roman Church; and the Succession of Bishops in
the Greek Church, is as good a Note of the Greek
Church. And any Churches which have been later
planted, who have Bishops in Succession from any of
the Apostles or Apostolical Bishops, by this Note are
as good Churches as they. So that this is a Note com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all true Churches, and therefore can do the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> no Service.</p>
            <p>His seventh Note indeed is home to his purpose:
That that is the only true Church, which is united to
the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to its Head. If he could prove
this, it must do his business without any other Notes,
but that will be examined hereafter. But it is like
the Confidence of a Jesuit, to make that the Note of
the Church, which is the chief Subject of the Dispute.</p>
            <p>The Sum is this: There can be no Notes of a true
Church, but what belong to all true Churches: for
tho there is but one Catholick Church, yet there are
a great many true particular Churches, which make up
this Catholick Church, as homogeneal Parts, which
have all the same Nature. But now very few of the
Cardinal's Notes belong to all true Churches; and those
which do so, signifie nothing to his purpose, because
they are common to more Churches than the Church of
<hi>Rome.</hi> And as for the Catholick Church, that is known
only by particular Churches; for it is nothing else, but
the Union of all true Churches in Faith and Worship,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98208:10"/>
and one Communion, as far as distinct Churches at a
great distance from each other are capable of it: And
therefore there is no other way to know which is the
Catholick Church, but by knowing all the true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in the World, which either are in actual Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with one another, or are in a Disposition for it,
whenever occasion is offered: For it is impossible that
all true Christian Churches all the World over, should
ever joyn in any visible and external Acts of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
and therefore tho we know and believe, that
there is a Catholick Church, because we are assured
that all true Churches in the World are but one Church,
the one Body and Spouse of Christ; yet it is next to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to know all the Parts of the Catholick Church
(without which we cannot know the whole Catholick
Church) because we cannot know all the particular
true Churches all the World over. Nor indeed is there
any need we should: For we may certainly know
which is a truly Catholick Church, without knowing
the whole Catholick Church. For every Church,
which professes the true Catholick Faith, and imposes
only Catholick Terms of Communion, and is ready,
out of the Principles of Brotherly Love and Charity
(that cement of Catholick Communion) to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with all Churches, and to receive all Churches to
her Communion upon these Terms, is a truly Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, which shews how ridiculous it is to make
the Catholick Church our first Inquiry, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to give Notes to find out the true Catholick
Church by, before we know what a true Particular
Church is. But the Mystery of this will appear more
in what follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> For another Mystery of finding the true
Church by Notes, is to pick out of all the Christian
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98208:11"/>
Churches in the World one Church, which we must
own for the only Catholick Church; and reject all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Churches as Heretical, or Schismatical, or Un-ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Churches, who refuse Obedience and Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to this One Catholick Church. For if this be not
the Intent of it, what will all the Notes of the Church
signify to prove, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the only
true Catholick Church? And if they do not prove this,
the Cardinal has lost his labour. For tho the Notes he
assigns were the Notes of a true Church, yet they may
and must belong to all other true Churches, as well
as to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> unless he can prove, that
there is but One true Church, or but One Church,
which is the Mistress of all other Churches, and the
only Principle and Center of Catholick Unity. And
this ought to have been proved first, before he had
thought of the Notes of the Church.</p>
            <p>So that there are many things to be proved here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are ready for the Notes of the Church? They
must first prove, that there is but one true Church in the
World: for tho we all grant, that there is but One Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, yet we say, there may be, and hope,
nay more than so, know that there are many true
Churches, which make up the Catholick Church. Yet
before the Notes of a true Church can do any Service
to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they must prove, that there
is but one true Church in the World; and then it will
signify something to prove the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be
that true Church.</p>
            <p>They must prove also, that the Catholick Church
does not signify all the particular true Churches that
are in the World; but some one Church, which is the
Fountain of Catholick Unity; which all other Churches
are bound to submit to, and communicate with, if they
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98208:11"/>
will be Members of the Catholick Church. For tho
all the Churches in the World were in Subjection to
that Church, yet they receive their Catholicism from
their Communion with that Church; and therefore that
only is the Catholick Church. It is not meerly the
Communion of all Churches together, which makes
the Catholick Church; but it is the Subjection of all
Churches to that one Catholick Church, which makes
them Catholick: So that they must prove, that there is
one particular Church, which is the Catholick Church;
that is, that a part is the whole; that one particular
Church is all the Churches of the World; for so the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church signifies in Ancient Writers. This is so
absurd, that some of our Modern Advocates for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> tell us, that they do not mean
the particular Diocess of <hi>Rome</hi> by the Catholick Church,
but all those Churches, which are in Communion with
the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> But suppose this, yet it is only
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> which makes all the other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
Catholick, and therefore she only is the Catholick
Church. And I will presently make them confess it to
be so: For let us suppose, that no other Churches should
submit themselves to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (by the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> understanding the particular Diocess
of <hi>Rome</hi>) would she be the Catholick Church or not?
If notwithstanding this she would be the Catholick
Church; then it is evident, that they make the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the Catholick Church; if she
would not, then I cannot see how Communion with the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is essential to the Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>These things, I say, ought to have been proved, before
the Cardinal had given us the Notes of the Church; for
it is a hard thing to prove by Notes, that the particular
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the only Catholick Church, till it be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98208:12"/>
proved, that a particular Church may be the Catholick
Church, or that there is one particular Church, which
is the Catholick Church. This he knew we all deny;
and it is a ridiculous thing to think to convince us by
Notes, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the particular Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church; when we deny that there is any such
Church; and affirm, that it is a Contradiction to own
it; as great a Contradiction, as it is to say, that a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Church is the Universal Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> But when I consider the farther Design of these
Note-Makers, to find out such a Church on whose
Authority we must rely for the whole Christian Faith,
even for the holy Scriptures themselves, it makes me
now admire, that they should think this could be done
by some Notes of a Church; especially by such Notes
as the Cardinal gives us.</p>
            <p>For suppose he had given us the Notes of a true <hi>Church,</hi>
which is the utmost he can pretend to; before we can
hence conclude that this Church is the Infallible Guide,
and uncontroulable Judg of Controversies, we must be
satisfied, that the true Church is Infallible. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>Bellarmin</hi> attempts to prove in his third Book of
the Church; and it is not my Concern at present to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
how he proves it. But I am sure this can never be
proved but by Scripture; for unless Christ have bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Infallibility on the Church, I know not how we can
prove she has it; and whether Christ have done it or
not, can never be known but by the Scriptures: So
that a Man must believe the Scriptures, and use his own
Judgment to understand them, before it can be proved
to him, that there is an Infallible Church; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
those who resolve the belief of the Scriptures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Authority of the Church, cannot, without great
Impudence, urge the Authority of the Scriptures to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98208:12"/>
prove the Church's Infallibility; and yet thus they all
do; nay prove their very Notes of the Church from
Scripture, as the Cardinal does: and think this is no
Circle neither, because we Hereticks believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
without the Authority of their Church, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are willing to dispute with them out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
But this is a fault on our side, and when we
dispute with them, whatever we do at other times, we
should not believe the Scriptures, till they had proved
them to us their way, by the Authority of their
Church; and then we should quickly see what blessed
Work they would make of it. How they would
prove their Church's Infallibility, and what fine Notes
we should have of a Church, when we had rejected all
their Scripture-proofs, as we ought to do, till they have
first satisfied us, that theirs is the only true Infallible
Church, upon whose Authority we must believe the
Scriptures, and every thing else. I confess, I would
gladly hear what Notes they would give a Pagan to
find out the true Infallible Church by.</p>
            <p>It is certainly a most sensless thing to resolve all our
Faith into the Authority of the Church, as if the Church
were the first Object of our Faith in Religion; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t   is demonstrable,
that we must know and believe
most of the Articles of the Christian Faith before we
can know whether there be any Church or not. The
order observed in the Apostles Creed is a plain Evidence
of this, for all those Articles which are before the Holy
Catholick Church must in order of Nature be known
before it. That there is a God who made the World;
that Jesus Christ is the only begotten Son of God, who
was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin
<hi>Mary,</hi> suffered under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> was crucified,
dead, and buried, and descended into Hell, that he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98208:13"/>
rose again the third day from the dead, and ascended
into Heaven, and sitteth on the Right-hand of God the
Father Almighty, and from thence shall come to judg
the Quick and the Dead; I believe in the Holy Ghost;
and then we may add the Holy Catholick Church, and
not till then. For the Church is a Society of Men for the
Worship of God, through the Faith of Jesus Christ, by
the Sanctification of the Holy Spirit, which unites them
into one Mystical Body: So that we must know Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Son, and Holy Ghost, before we can know what
the Catholick Church means. And is it not strange
then, that our Faith must be founded on the Authority
of the Church, when we must first know all the great
Articles of our Faith, before we can know any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a Church. This inverts the order of our Creed,
which according to the Principles of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> should begin thus. I believe in the Holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, and upon the Authority of that Church,
I believe in God the Father Almighty, and in Jesus
Chrst, and in the Holy Ghost: and no doubt but the
Apostles, or those Apostolical Men, who framed the
Creed, would have put it so, had they thought the
whole Christian Faith must be resolved into the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Church.</p>
            <p>This short Discourse, I think, is enough in general
concerning the Notes of the Church; and I shall leave
