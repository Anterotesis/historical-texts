         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He ſays he is to anſwer Circumſtances with Circumſtances, my Lord; he ſays he has ſome Witneſſes as to Circumſtances that are very material to anſwer ſuch Circumſtances as are brought againſt him; he does not underſtand the Law, my Lord, nor has had no time to have any Council to inform himſelf.</p>

Count <hi>Coningſmark</hi> knowing how Innocent he is, won't ſtick for a day or two, but he will be ready to be Tryed as your Lordſhip ſhall think fit; he has Innocence on his ſide, and that will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect him.</p>

               <p>Then Swear a Jury. But look you, my Lord <hi>Coningſmark,</hi> conſider this, As the Gentlemen of the Jury come to be Sworn, if you do diſlike any of them, you may except againſt them.</p>

               <p>My Lord, he ſays, being altogether a Stranger here in <hi>England,</hi> and not knowing any of the Perſons, he begs the favour of the Bench, that he may have the Names of thoſe that are Returned of the Jury, and a little time to conſider of it.</p>

If you find them or any of them Guilty, you are to inquire, whether they or any of them fled for it; If you find that they or any of them fled for it, you are to inquire of their Goods and Chattels, as if you had found them Guilty; if you find them or any of them not Guilty, nor that they did fly for it, you are to ſay ſo, and no more, and hear your Evidence.

               <speaker>Sir Francis Withins.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord and Gentlemen, I am of Counſel in this Caſe for the King, againſt the Priſoners at the Bar. There are three of them Indicted as Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals in this Murder, the fourth as Acceſſory before. In this Caſe that is now before you, Gentlemen, I cannot chuſe but take Notice unto you, that a Murder of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has never been heard of to be perpetrated upon <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ground, both in reſpect of the Perſon Murdered, and in reſpect of the Circumſtances of the Fact. For the Perſon Murdered, a Gentleman of that Quality and Eſtate, that he hath left but few equals behind him. That this Man being in his Coach, ſhould be way-layed, ſurprized, Murdered, and this Murder Committed in the midſt of our Streets, is that which works Amazement in all <hi>Engliſh</hi> hearts. And our only Comfort upon this ſad Occaſion is, that there is not one Native of this Countrey found amongſt all thoſe that are Accuſed to be Inſtruments in this Barbarous Fact.</p>
               <p>I did Obſerve to you, Gentlemen, before, that there are three named to be Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals; <hi>Borosky,</hi> whom for diſtinction ſake, I ſhall call by the name of the <hi>Polander, Vratz,</hi> who is called the Captain, and <hi>Sterne,</hi> who is called the Lieutenant. <hi>Borosky</hi> the <hi>Polander,</hi> we ſay, was the Man that diſcharged this Blunderbuſs againſt this Worthy Gentleman that was ſlain, but though he was the only Man that diſcharged it, yet if we can ſatisfie you that <hi>Vratz</hi> and <hi>Sterne</hi> were with him at the ſame time, aiding and aſſiſting him when he gave the blow, they are as much Principals as he that ſhot off the Gun. It will be natural to open to you what is ſaid againſt this Captain <hi>Vratz;</hi> he is a <hi>Swede</hi> by Birth, and did formerly belong to Count <hi>Coningſmark;</hi> he was a Retainer to him. Afterwards, I think in the War he was made a Captain. This Gentleman had been formerly in <hi>England,</hi> but at the laſt time he came, which was three weeks, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, before the Murder was committed, his Lodging was in <hi>King-ſtreet</hi> at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi> This Captain <hi>Vratz,</hi> we ſhall prove, did often Diſcourſe that he had a Quarrel with Mr. <hi>Thynne,</hi> that ſeveral times before this Murder was Actually done, he Ordered his Servant to way-lay his Coach, and upon that very Fatal day, the <hi>12th.</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> when this unhappy Accident fell out, having Information that Mr. <hi>Thynne</hi> was gone out in his Coach, immediately he puts on his Boots, gives Order to his Servant to bring his Cloaths to him at ſuch a place, becauſe he ſhould remove his Lodging, he ſaid, that Night, that he ſhould bring his Cloaths to the <hi>Black Bull Inn</hi> in <hi>Holborn,</hi> and bring his Horſe thither too. When he went from his Lodging, the <hi>Polander</hi> went along with him, and they came to the <hi>Black Bull</hi> in <hi>Holborn,</hi> where they met with <hi>Sterne.</hi> We ſhall ſhew you, that theſe three Gentlemen being thus Armed, one with a Blunderbuſs, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond with Piſtols, and the other very well provided, rid out about ſix of the Clock, the Murder being Committed about ſeven or eight. At their going out, they enquired which was their way to <hi>Temple Barr,</hi> they were ſeen to ride through the <hi>Strand</hi> to St. <hi>Jameſes,</hi> the Fact was done in the <hi>Pall-mall,</hi> and we ſhall ſhew you the way of it was thus; Mr. <hi>Thynne</hi> paſſing through the Street to go home in his Coach, three Perſons came riding up to the Coach-ſide, and while the one ſtopped the Horſes, immediately the Blunderbuſs was diſcharged into the Coach againſt Mr. <hi>Thynne,</hi> and gave him thoſe Wounds, of which the next Morning he dyed. Preſently theſe three Men ran away, but one of them let fall a Piſtol upon the place, which I ſhall obſerve as a Material Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance againſt theſe Perſons, becauſe we ſhall prove whoſe the Blunderbuſs was. Theſe things being done, this Murder Committed, and they gone away, it began to work in Peoples thoughts, and Circumſtances began to come out, that this Blunderbuſs ſhould be Ordered to be bought by Captain <hi>Vratz,</hi> who had Diſcourſed with many Perſons about the Quarrel he had with Mr. <hi>Thynne,</hi> and given Order to his Servant to way-lay his Coach, and theſe Perſons being Rid out at that time, there was a great Suſpicion that they did it. Great care there was taken, and great means uſed, as no doubt there would be, to Apprehend the Malefactors; and by great Providence it was found out at laſt, that this Captain <hi>Vratz,</hi> according to his Word, had altered his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and was got to a Doctors Houſe, that lived, I think, in <hi>Leiceſter Fields.</hi> Being there ſurprized, and coming upon his Examination, he did not deny but he was there one of the three that was at the place when and where Mr. <hi>Thynne</hi> was Murdered, but he pretended, he did intend to Fight him in a Duel, and kill him fairly, as he called it. But Gentlemen, I muſt Obſerve this to you, in my ſmall time of Experience of the World, I never knew a Man go to Fight a Duel and carry out with him a Second with a Blunderbuſs. 'Tis not poſſible he ſhould go with ſuch a Deſign as he would inſinuate, but rather with an intention of Murder. For the <hi>Polander,</hi> he came into <hi>England</hi> but
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44371:7"/>
the Friday before, and ſo we ſhall prove to you that which will ſtick hard upon the Count. Upon Friday, he being landed, he inquires for the young Count's Tutor, which was at an Academy of one Monſieur <hi>Fauberts;</hi> and there he inquires for the Count's Secretary; he lay there, I think that Night, and upon Saturday he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the Count's Lodgings. There alſo he was lodged for one Night. The Count was pleaſed to be ſpeak him a very good Sword, and a Coat for him, that he might be well armed, and there he lay Saturday-night, as I ſaid, the night before the Murder was committed. Upon Sunday, Gentlemen, there being a Meſſage ſent to this Doctor, where <hi>Vratz</hi> lay, the night following that the Count would ſpeak with the Doctor, the Doctor came, and the Doctor and the <hi>Polander</hi> went away to Capt. <hi>Vratz</hi> Lodging, and from thence to <hi>Holborn,</hi> to the <hi>Black Bull,</hi> and the Captain was carried in as much ſecreſie as he could, for he was carried in a Sedan; and I think we ſhall be able to prove by the perſons that carried him, that this was the Man. For the other Gentleman, <hi>Stern,</hi> the Lieutenant, as they call him, he was an antient Acquaintance of Capt. <hi>Vratz</hi>'s, had known him long ago in <hi>England,</hi> and complained to him, that Lodgings might be very dear: but the Captain told him, he had a Deſign; that if he would aſſiſt him, as a brave fellow, would maintain him, and he ſhould not want Money to bear all his Charges. But we ſhall prove, that this was the third perſon that rid out with the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi> and the Captain in this Garb, that I told you of, this night that the Fact was done. And indeed, Gentlemen, upon their Examination they have every one confeſſed the Fact; even the <hi>Polander</hi> confeſſed; that he did ſhoot off the Blunderbuſs; and <hi>Vratz</hi> confeſſed, that he was there, and the Lieutenant <hi>Sterns;</hi> ſo that if there had been no more Evidence, it would have been ſufficient to maintain the Iſſue, and in our Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, it is more perhaps than could be expected. This, Gentlemen, is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Sum of the Evidence that will be given againſt the three Principals. For the fourth, Gentlemen, Count <hi>Coningſmark;</hi> he is a perſon of great Quality, and I am extraordinary ſorry to find the Evidence ſo ſtrong againſt him, as my Brief imports; I wiſh his Innocence were greater, and our Evidence leſs; for he is a perſon of too great Quality, one would hope, to be concerned in a thing of this nature; but that he was the maid Abettor and Procuror of this Barbarous Buſineſs, we ſhall prove upon theſe grounds: Firſt, That he had a Deſign upon Mr. <hi>Thynne</hi>'s Life; for, Gentlemen, coming into <hi>England,</hi> about three Weeks before this Matter was tranſacted, firſt he lies in diſguiſe, and lies private, and removes his Lodging from place to place frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; That he ſent a perſon to inquire of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Reſident, Whether, or no, if he ſhould Kill Mr. <hi>Thynne</hi> in a Duel, he could by the Laws of <hi>England</hi> afterwards Marry the Lady <hi>Ogle?</hi> So that Mr. <hi>Thynne</hi>'s Death was in proſpect from the beginning. Gentlemen, We ſhall prove to you, as I did in ſome meaſure open before, that the Count himſelf was pleaſed to give expreſs order, that the <hi>Polander</hi> ſhould have a good Sword bought him; That before he came into <hi>England,</hi> he was very much troubled, by reaſon of the ſtormy Weather, for fear he ſhould be caſt away; that he lodged him in his own Lodging the Night before this Act was perpetrated; and that Captain <hi>Vratz</hi> was the Morning before and immediately after with the Count. Another thing, Gentlemen, that I had almoſt forgot; The Count was willing to be inſtructed in the Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and inquired, Whether a man might lawfully ride out upon a Sunday? and being told, That after Sermon he might; he was very well ſatisfied: and the day he inquired of it, was the day that the Murder was committed. After the thing was done, Count <hi>Coningſmark</hi> the next Morning pretended he was to go to <hi>Windſor,</hi> and leaves his Lodging; but inſtead of going to <hi>Windſor,</hi> (being ſtill in his diſguiſe) he goes to <hi>Rotherhith,</hi> by the Water-ſide, and there, I think, he continues two or three days in a Black Peruque; (and that is diſguiſe enough for ſuch a Gentleman.) And afterwards he goes to <hi>Graveſend;</hi> but, I think, he was upon the Water ſome time, before he thought it convenient to land; and there he was ſurprized in this diſguiſe. And when he was ſurprized and taken, he ſhew'd himſelf to be in great diſorder: but being charged with the Fact, acknowledged nothing of the Matter; but how it ſhould come to paſs, that he ſhould lie ſo long diſguiſed, upon no pretence that can be known, and afterwards to pretend that he had a buſineſs to effect, and then he was to go into <hi>France,</hi> that will lye upon him to anſwer. But theſe are the inducing Evidences that we give to you; his keeping the <hi>Polander</hi> in his Houſe, his diſguiſing of himſelf, and his inquiring, Whether if he Killed Mr. <hi>Thynne,</hi> he might not Marry my Lady <hi>Ogle?</hi> his flight the next day, and pretending to go to <hi>Windſor,</hi> when he went quite the other
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44371:7"/>
way, and all in a diſguiſe; And theſe perſons not having any appearance, or any reaſon whatſoever, for any particular quarrel to Mr. <hi>Thynne,</hi> but the Count having ſome diſguſt to him, upon the Terms that the Witneſſes will tell you of by and by, and being related to the Count, we muſt leave it to you to judge, whether theſe Gentlemen did it ſingly and purely upon their own heads, or whether they were not ſet upon it by the Count.</p>

               <p>Two of them, the little ones, may be Iron, for one of them went through a thick Bone, and yet there was no impreſſion on it.</p>

He confeſſed he was there, and ſtopped the Coach, but the <hi>Polonian</hi> fired by miſtake; for he did not bid him to fire, but only in caſe he ſhould be hindred from fighting, or making his Eſcape.</p>

               <p>He ſays, he has ſeen him ſeveral times in the Play-houſe, and riding in his Coach; he did not ſee him at <hi>Richmond,</hi> for if he had, he would not have put it up ſo long.</p>

               <p>He ſays he had no Friend to ſend to Mr. <hi>Thynne,</hi> and he could not ſpeak with Mr. <hi>Thynne</hi> himſelf; for Mr. <hi>Thynne</hi> might think that he was not a Gentleman good enough to fight with him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Hanſon.</speaker>
               <p>I ſay there was no direct meſſage: But I ſay this was the buſineſs; Count <hi>Conningsmark</hi> told me in private familiar diſcourſe, that he had heard that Eſquire <hi>Thynne</hi> had ſpoken ſome abuſive languag<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> him, and he would fain know what the conſequence of this would be, if he ſhould call him to account about this buſineſs; and he named the Swediſh Envoy to me: And I ſaw his deſire was to know his Opinion about the buſineſſes, what the conſequence of it would be. So I ſpoke to the Swediſh Envoy, and he gave me this anſwer, That if the Count ſhould any way meddle with Eſquire <hi>Thynne,</hi> he would have but bad living in <hi>England;</hi> but what the Law would ſay in that particular Caſe he could not anſwer, but he would enquire, and afterwards would give me an account, but I never ſpake with him after.</p>

               <p>I ask you, becauſe you have been formerly examined in another place about this matter. Do you remember any thing that ever you heard the Count ſpeaking of fighting with Mr. <hi>Thynne?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Hanſon.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Count <hi>Conningsmark</hi> ſpoke to me in the <hi>German</hi> Language; I ſpoke to the Swediſh Agent in <hi>French;</hi> and when I was before the King and Council I ſpoke in <hi>Engliſh;</hi> therefore I deſire no evil conſtruction may be made of it. I cannot remember the Count ſpake of killing or duelling. On the contrary I can ſwear for Count <hi>Conningsmark</hi> this, that I am confident he never told me that he had reſolved or would fight with Mr. <hi>Thynne,</hi> or would call him to account, but if he ſhould call him to accompt, what would be the conſequence of it.</p>

               <p>If my words may not turn to the prejudice of my Lord Count <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningsmark,</hi> but this is the ſubſtance of the thing; my Lord Count <hi>Conningsmark</hi> did tell me in familiar Diſcourſe, that Eſquire <hi>Thynne</hi> had ſpoken ſome reflecting Words upon him; he did deſire to know if he did call him to account, whether in this caſe the Laws of <hi>England</hi> might not go contrary to his Deſign in his Pretenſions, that he might have upon my Lady <hi>Ogle.</hi> And in that familiar Diſcourſe, he ſeemed to think that Monfieur <hi>Lienburgh</hi> could give him advice. In a little while afterwards, I was paying my reſpects to the Envoy, and reflecting upon the Counts Converſation, I ſpoke to him about this buſineſs, and his anſwer was this; he told me, that if he ſhould meddle with Mr. <hi>Thynne,</hi> he would have no good living in <hi>England:</hi> But as to the particular Queſtion, what the Conſequence of the Law might be, he did not know, but inquire and tell me, but I never asked him any Queſtion about it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. And if my Converſation with this Count, or with Monſieur <hi>Lienburgh,</hi> ſhould turn to the Count's prejudice, I ſhould be anſwerable for it to God and my own Conſcience, all the dayes of my Life. I deſire Mr. <hi>Thynne</hi>'s blood might be revenged, but I deſire alſo, that innocent Blood may be ſpared.</p>

               <p>My Diſcourſe with Count <hi>Conningſmark</hi> was this; in a familiar Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe amongſt other things, he ſpoke, that he heard <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
                  <hi>Thynne</hi> had affronted him, I don't know upon what Subject, but I believe it was words reflecting upon him and his Horſe; he did not tell me that he deſired me to go, nor did he give me any poſitive charge to go to the Swediſh Envoy, but by the diſcourſe I had with him, I did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that he was deſirous to have his advice, I thought his inclinations were, that I ſhould go and ask his advice; I did not go on purpoſe to do the Meſſage, nor did I receive any order that can be called a Meſſage in my Life, to my remembrance; but when I came to pay my reſpects in a familiar Diſcourſe, I did propoſe this to the Envoy; what might be the Conſequence, if the Count ſhould call Mr. <hi>Thynne</hi> to account; and he told me the ſame Anſwer that I have already told you. Now this I deſire only to conſider, that it was ſpoken in divers Languages; and if a man ſhould write down my Expreſſions now, as they came from me, they would upon reading perhaps, appear not ſo well; ſo if theſe Expreſſions of mine ſhould turn to Count <hi>Conningsmark</hi>'s prejudice, as that I ſhould Swear that this Phraſe of killing or duelling was uſed, or that ever Count <hi>Conningsmark</hi> told me that he reſolved to call, or that he would call him to an account, I might do him wrong perhaps, but if he ſhould call him to account, what might be the Conſequence of it.</p>

               <p>I remember very well what paſſed between the Count and him, for I have thought of it. He ſpoke to him, and called him <hi>thou,</hi> as to his Servant, and asked him, where he had been all the while, and he anſwered he had been at Sea, toſſed up and down.</p>

               <p>I went to the Counts Lodgings, and being deſired by him to ſtay, I deſired he would excuſe me, for I could not ſtay, becauſe I was to go about another Buſineſs; he told me the Fellow was all naked, and he had no man to ſend to buy him a Riding-Coat; I told him I would very willingly and heartily do it. And after I had dined, I went to an Houſe near the <hi>Hay-market,</hi> and bought a Riding-Coat, and brought the Riding-Coat to the Counts Lodgings. I delivered it to the Count. Then the Count told me his Man had never a Sword, and I asked him how much his Lordſhip would pleaſe to beſtow on a Sword, he told me a matter of 10s. or thereabouts; I told him I did not know where I ſhould get ſuch a Sword, nor how to ſend for it, becauſe I was to meet his Brother, but I withal ſaid, it is no matter for that, I will take care you ſhall have it; this Evening I went into St. <hi>Martins-Lane,</hi> but could not find ever a Sword worth a Groat. Then I went as far as <hi>Charing-Croſs</hi> to a Cutler whom I knew, ſo I told him, Sir, ſaid I, I have a Commiſſion to beſtow 10 s. on a Sword for a Servant, therefore ſaid I, I leave it to your diſcretion, uſe my Friend well, and uſe your ſelf favourably too. I asked him when I ſhould have the Sword, he told me in the Evening; I told him I would call for it when I came from the Play, where I was to be with the Counts Brother. When I came back with the young Count <hi>Conningſmark</hi> from the Play I called for the Sword, but he told me it was not ready. I ſeemed to be a little angry, and told him that it was ſtrange, a Gentleman could not get a little Sword got ready for him in an whole Afternoon. Well, Sir, ſaid he, pray do not be impatient, I will ſend you the Sword, and afterwards he ſent it to the Academy, and I afterwards ſent the Sword to Count <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningſmarks</hi> Lodgings.</p>

The firſt time when he came he was in a Campaign Coat; but all the time he was in his Lodging, as I remember, he was in his Night-Gown and Cap. As to the other part of his Queſtion, whether I heard that he took Phyſick? I ſay this, When I ſaw Count <hi>Conningsmark</hi> firſt at his Lodging; when I came to him, on the <hi>Sunday</hi> Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I was told the Count was in Bed: It was late, but I ventured to go into his Room, and ſat a quarter of an hour there; and afterwards the Doctor came in, Dr. <hi>Frederick,</hi> I ſaw him oftentimes at his Lodging; and at the ſame time the young Count was ſick of an Ague: and when he came one Evening to ſee the young Count, I asked him what was the Diſtemper the Count had? the Doctor anſwered me, that he had not told any Body that the Count was ſick, or what he was ſick of, but he hoped in God in a ſhort time he would be recovered.</p>

But I do not know that ever the Count had a mind to give me ſuch an Order, but I did it voluntarily.</p>

I told him, I had ſome other Buſineſs, I was with ſome French Merchants to look upon ſome Goods. So he bid the Pole pay me for my trouble, and take up his things, and go along with him; and he did do ſo, and I never ſaw the Pole afterwards.</p>

               <p>In the firſt beginning I gave him no Name, but ſaid he to me, If any Body ask you about me, I would not be known; for if they know that I lie privately thus, they will think I ail ſome ill Diſtemper, therefore I would have you call me by the Name of <hi>Carlo Cuski.</hi>

               <speaker>Dr. Harder.</speaker>
               <p>The Letter was not written to the Count, but it was writ to me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. Harder.</speaker>
               <p>I received a Letter from Capt. <hi>Vratz,</hi> that the Count deſired to ſpeak with me; and afterwards I was deſired to direct this Man, the Polander, to Captain <hi>Vratz;</hi> and ſo I directed him to Capt. <hi>Vratz,</hi> and nothing more I know.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Fr. VVin.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Well, Sir, one thing more and I have done with you, for you will not, I ſee, give a reaſonable Anſwer; pray, when the Polander came along with you from the Counts, did you obſerve he had any thing about him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. Harder.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Craven.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, the Count deſires to ask him ſome Queſtions.</p>

               <p>Yes, my Lord, when he came from <hi>Tangier,</hi> he had ſpots over all his Breaſt; and it was feared they might get up higher towards his Neck, and indanger him very much.</p>

               <p>No, there is no need of that Goctor. Did you give him Phyſick for that?</p>

               <p>He ſays, my Lord, he over-heated himſelf in riding to <hi>Tangier,</hi> thinking to do the King and the Nation Service, and the Heat broke out in ſpots over his Breſt.</p>

               <p>Yes, I did adminiſter Phyſick unto him; and this my own man can teſtify and be witneſs of; becauſe my Lord bid me take care that he might be private, for he would not have it known that he did take Phyſick; but I told my man, ſaid I, 'tis my Lord <hi>Conningsmark,</hi> and therefore pray take care of him, and ſee that the Phyſick be made very well up.</p>

               <p>I found him that day ill, lying down upon the Bed, I asked him how his Phyſick had worked; he told me he was afraid he had got ſome cold; and indeed I found him very much diſordered, and I went home and fetched him ſome Phyſick to take that night.</p>

               <p>By the Oath you have taken, was there any other occaſion, or had you any other diſcourſe with him, when you came on the <hi>Sunday</hi> night, but concerning his Phyſick?</p>

            <sp>

               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I will tell you the Truth; I never heard the Count ſpeak any word in my life, that he had any concern, or deſign of any quarrel at all, nor any diſcourſe, but about the adminiſtration of his Phyſick.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. J.</speaker>
               <p>Let me ask you this Queſtion, for they deſire it here, What was the occaſion? And whether you know the occaſion why my Lord altered his Lodgings ſo often?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Harder.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>The firſt occaſion was this, Becauſe it was in the <hi>Hay-market;</hi> and his Man ſaid it would be quickly known if he did continue there; ſo he would take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lodging, which was in <hi>Buperts-ſtreet,</hi> and there he lodged three days; but the Chimney did ſo ſmoke, that my Lord could not ſtay, becauſe he could have no Fire in his Chamber, and the weather was very cold, for it did Snow, and therefore I told my Lord, it was not ſo proper for taking of Phyſick: Thereupon he deſired me to take him another Lodging in <hi>Queen-ſtreet,</hi> which I did look about for, but it was not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſo he had a Lodging taken for him in <hi>St. Martins-lane,</hi> where he lodged till he went away.</p>

in what Condition you found the Count at <hi>Graves-End.</hi> Tell the whole ſtory, and ſpeak aloud, that all may hear you.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Kid.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I had ſome Information upon <hi>Friday</hi> Night of him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Willians.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Of whom, and what?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Kid.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Of the Count where he was. So I made it my Buſineſs to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into it. On <hi>Saturday</hi> in the Afternoon a Gentleman came to me, and gave me certain Information where he thought that Gentleman the Count was. This Gentleman coming to me ſaid, Mr. <hi>Thynne</hi> is a ſtranger to me, but ſaid he, I would not have Mr. <hi>Thynn</hi>'s Blood lye at my door. This ſame perſon who is put out in the <hi>Gazette,</hi> I believe, is at a Neighbours houſe of mine. Says he, I deſire you to be private in it, becauſe it may do you a prejudice: ſo we went into a Coach at <hi>Charing-Croſs</hi> to go to a Juſtice of Peace; I did not know where Sir <hi>John Reresby</hi> lived, but inquired of Mr. <hi>Gibbon</hi>'s, who told me, but he was not at home, and Mr. <hi>Bridgman</hi> was not at home; So we went to the Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and there we had a Warrant, and then I came by water to <hi>Rotherith,</hi> and this ſame <hi>Raynes</hi> that was Examined, and his Wife where he lay, were gone to <hi>Greenwich</hi> to carry his Clothes, a grey Suit, and other Clothes that he had left. So going down to <hi>Greenwich</hi> we called every Boat that was upon the River aboard of us, to know whence they came. And we had taken her Siſter along with us, and ſhe called out her Siſters name <hi>Mall Raynes,</hi> and her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers name <hi>Derrick Raynes,</hi> and ſo at laſt we got the Boat wherein they were on board us. And we asked the man, what he had done with the Gentleman that lay at his Houſe? he declared, he was gone away he did not know whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So I went back again to this Gentleman that gave me this firſt Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who did go to him as a Neighbour, to know whither he was gone, and where he was to be found, and where he would Land. So he declared the particulars, That if we miſſed him that Night, we ſhould have him in the <hi>Hope</hi> upon <hi>Monday</hi> Morning, upon a Veſſel that was to be cleared on <hi>Monday</hi> Morning. So upon <hi>Sunday</hi> Night coming to <hi>Graveſ-end</hi> about 8 or 9 a Clock, or there abouts, there he landed. There were 13 or 14 <hi>Swedes</hi> at the ſame Houſe where he was to Land. So we thought it convenient to take him at his firſt land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for fear of further danger. So I ſtay'd at the <hi>Red Lyon</hi> Back-Stayres, and he landed at the Fore-ſtayres where the Watermen were. As ſoon as he was laid hold of, I came to him, ſaid I, your Lordſhip ſhall not want for any thing that is convenient. He deſired to know, whether I knew him? I told him; Yes, and that his name was Count <hi>Coningsmarke.</hi> That is my Name, ſays he; I do not deny it. So the Maior came and the <hi>Custom-Houſe Officers</hi> Searched him? and found nothing at all of any Arms about him. He deſired he might be uſed like a Gentleman, and ſo he was, for there was no abuſe given to him, as I know of. Coming up the River, the moſt of my diſcourſe was about Martial Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; a Serjeant that had the Command of a File of Muſqueteers, which the Deputy-Governour ſent to guard the Count to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> a Gentleman ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting there by me was asking me concerning Mr. <hi>Thynne</hi>'s Murder; I told him, that I was at <hi>New-gate</hi> on <hi>Friday,</hi> and there I ſaw thoſe that had done <hi>that</hi> barbarous Fact. With that, my Lord asked, what Lodgings there were in <hi>New-gate.</hi> And whether the Captain had a good Lodging? I told him a very good one. He asked me, whether he confeſſed any thing? I told him he had confeſſed ſome particulars; And ſaid I, 'tis the moſt barbarous thing that ever was done. Certainly, ſays my Lord, this Mr. <hi>Thynne</hi> muſt have Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence and Commerce with ſome Lady that this Captain knew, that belonged to the Court, or he would never have done it. As for the <hi>Polander,</hi> I told him, that he had confeſſed, he wept mightily. With that my Lord ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very much concerned, and took up his Clothes and bit them, and ſat awhile up, but was very much diſcompoſed, and then deſired to lye down.</p>

               <p>My Lord, Aſſoon as ever he came to ſhore, I walked by him, and gave him a little kind of a juſtle, and my reaſon was, to ſee whether he had not a black Coat under his Campaign: I walked cloſe to him juſt in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as he walked along, ſo he turns about again, and went down to the Water ſide, and asked the Water-men, Watermen, Have you ſtowed your Boat? he anſwered, Yes; Then come away ſaid he; ſo ſoon as he came back again, I catched him faſt hold by the Arm, and the firſt word he ſaid to me was, What do you come to Rob me? ſaid I, my Lord, you are my Priſoner, and I told him I was the King's Meſſenger that had waited there ſeveral days for him; holding of him very hard whether, that was the occaſion of it, or the Waterman that were on the other ſide of him, he dropped down his Sword between his Leggs; but when I named his Name, he gave a little ſtart and his Perriwig dropped off of his Face. We went up the Street to the Mayor, and the People crowding about us were very rude and very rugged, and he deſired he might be well uſed. We did all we could to keep the People from him; we went up to the Mayor's Houſe, and when we came there, I deſired he might be ſearched, whether he had any Arms; He ſaid, he had none, and there was none.</p>

               <p>We ſtayed there about ſome 2 or 3 Hours. After an hour or half an hours time, near upon an hour, my Lord came to me, and asked me my Name; and he ſaid, the reaſon was, that after his Trouble was over, he would give me thanks for my Civility to him. Captain <hi>Sinkleer,</hi> who ſtood by, gave him my Name before I could, that it was <hi>Gibbons.</hi> Yes ſaid I, my Name is <hi>Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bons,</hi> and I belong to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth:</hi> why ſays he, the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> has no Command now, and therefore how could I take him by his Order? My Lord, ſaid I, I do not apprehend you by his Order; you have killed a very good Friend of mine, and had not Providence ordered it otherwiſe, you had like to have killed a more particular Friend, and a Maſter: So my Lord he ſeemed to be very ſorry at that; but ſays he, I don't think they would have done any harm to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth.</hi>

               <p>He ſays, that his firſt Lodging was changed, becauſe it was too cold for him, and he ſays, the next Lodging where he was, thoſe that were there can tell, the room where he was ſmoaked ſo cruelly, that he was not able to endure it. And he ſays, he liked the houſe ſo well, that he ſent to ſee if the Chimney could be mended, and it was not to be done, otherwiſe he had gone back to that houſe, and he has the man and his wife to bear Witneſs of it if you pleaſe.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I having had the honour to ſerve a while under my Lord's Father, I was deſirous knowing the honour of the Family, and bearing a great reſpect to it, to do my Lord all the reaſonable Service I could. So hearing my Lord was taken, and in <hi>Newgate,</hi> I went to wait upon him, and coming there Mr. <hi>Richardſon</hi> told me, there was a little Boy waited at the Count's door for his Wages, as he ſaid. So I ſpake to the Boy, and asked him what does thou ſtay for? he told me for his Wages. Said I, certainly my Lord will pay you his Wages; how long have you ſerv'd him? ſaid he, a little while, and then ſaid I, if you lived with him, what do you know of this buſineſs. And then of himſelf he began and told me, Only this I know, that <hi>Vratz</hi> was in my Maſter's Chamber that night, and the <hi>Polander</hi> that Night went out with a pair of Boots under his Arm, and more then this I do not know. Said I. Boy who do you ſerve? Says he, I have no Maſter at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44371:24"/>
but then of his own accord he told me, Sir <hi>Thomas Thynne</hi> had promiſed him a place, and in the mean time, I am ſays he, to go to ſerve my Lord <hi>Privy-Seal;</hi> ſo my Lord gave him Twenty Shillings for his Wages.</p>

               <p>He ſays, my Lord, he kept his Chamber at that time, he had taken cold upon his taking Phyſick, and the Captain came to give him a viſit, and he never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon any one he came for, he was lying upon his Bed.</p>

               <p>He ſays, my Lord, As to the Clothes, when he ſaw him with all his Clothes torn, he muſt of neceſſity get him a Coat, or elſe he was a ſhame to him, and his Service. And as for the Sword, it was no more (he ſays) then what Servants of his bulke and making uſed to wear.</p>

               <p>Yes, my Lord, 'tis very frequent in <hi>Germany</hi> to give a Servant away if there be no uſe of him, for theſe Polanders are like ſlaves.</p>

               <speaker>Interpreter.</speaker>
               <p>And, my Lord, he ſays, that Mr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> does know, that the Merchant that ſent him over hither is a man of good Repute, and if this man had had an ill Reputation in <hi>Germany,</hi> he would not have ſent him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Witneſs.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I know very well he is a man of very great Credit in <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> and of great Eſtate.</p>

               <p>Can you ſpeak of his Credit Sir <hi>Nathaniel Johnſon?</hi>

               <p>Of the Merchant's Credit I can my Lord, I know him to be a man of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Eſtate and Credit. He is a man of ſuch a Reputation, that he would not ſend a man of an ill Reputation.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir N. Johnſon.</speaker>
               <p>A Rancounter is another ſort of thing Sir, you don't ſpeak as if you were a Souldier.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Williams.</speaker>
               <p>My being a Souldier or not is nothing to the buſineſs, but the Captain, ſaid he, intended to have made a Rancounter of it.</p>

               <speaker>Sir <hi>Francis Winn.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>What do you talk of a Preſident? When did you ſee a Preſident of alike Tryal of Strangers, that could ſpeak not a word of Engliſh; but you would feign have the Court thought hard of, for doing things that are extraordinary in this Caſe.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Craven.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, he ſays, that one <hi>Markham</hi> that is here, came and told him that upon the killing of this Man by the Polander and the Captain who were taken in ſuch a fact, there was a diſcourſe of it that it might turn to his prejudice, and that the Common people do commonly fall upon Strangers, that his Taylor told him, that he had heard the Common people name him as concerned in it, and that he believed, if the Common people did catch him, they would tear him to pieces, and ſo his friends did Counſel him that he would withdraw himſelf.</p>

               <p>I told him nothing, but I was ſent there by Mr. <hi>Hanſon,</hi> ſays he, tell the <hi>Count</hi> that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and ſeveral Noble-men have been here, Now I had not ſeen the <hi>Count</hi> at that time before, but he told me where he Lodged, when I came there I told the <hi>Count</hi> of it, but he told me he knew nothing of it, but ſayd he, I am ſorry if any ſuch thing be done.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Hanſon</hi> told me ſo then, I would not tell a lye for all the World.</p>

               <p>He ſays this man can witneſs, that he asked his man, what money he had left, and he told him that he had not above 10. or 11 l. ſo he put his hand in his bag and took out ſome and put it into his pocket.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Thynne.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Now my Lord this will require ſome Anſwer, how came you to tell thoſe Gentlemen that took you, that you believed Mr. <hi>Uratz</hi> and the reſt would have done the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> no harme?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Interpreter.</speaker>
               <p>He ſays, the people told when he was taken, that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was in the Coach, and that they did follow the Coach a great way and would not do the Action till the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was out of the Coach.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Count.</speaker>
               <p>They did tell me, the Crowd that were about me, that thoſe that were taken ſay'd they would not do it till the Duke was out.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Interpreter.</speaker>

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>He heard it ſo commonly it ſeems. Now my Lord, there is one thing more that you ſhould explain your ſelf, in what you meant by this, when you ſaid it would be a ſtain upon your bloud, yet one Noble Act in War or the Lodging upon a Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarp would waſh it off.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Interpreter.</speaker>
               <p>He ſays my Lord, that tho he knew himſelf Not Guilty of any thing, yet his being taken upon ſuſpition, and clapped up in Priſon, would be a great diſgrace to him, and would be worſe reſented in his own Country than the thing it ſelf was. It being not the Cuſtom in his Country to take Perſons of his Quality Priſoners in that manner.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Now my Lord, Is there any perſon that you would have called to ask any Queſtions of? If you have, they ſhall be called.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Count.</speaker>
               <p>No my Lord, but if you pleaſe to give me leave to tell ſomething that may be neceſſary.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then he ſpake in Dutch.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir N. Johnſon.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, he ſays, if you will give him leave, though it does not come very well from himſelf, yet he deſires to ſay ſomething for his own Reputation.</p>

               <p>Tis fit for men that ſtand here to ſay any thing that is reaſonable for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. My Lord, If you can ſpeak anything that you apprehend the Jury can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, ſpeak to them what you pleaſe, ſo as they underſtand it, but do not be too long.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Craven.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, If your Lordſhip pleaſe, he ſays he will ſpeak it firſt in French, and then in German.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Ay; but then the Engliſh man of the Jury will not underſtand a word of it; he had better ſpeak in Engliſh to the Jury.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J. North.</speaker>

               <speaker>Sr. N. Johnſon.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, he ſays it is a great happineſs in all his trouble, that he was in a Country, where he was to appear before a Proteſtant Judicature, himſelf being a Proteſtant, and his fore-Fathers alſo. He ſays that his fore-Fathers under <hi>Guſtaphus Adolphus</hi> were ſouldiers, and did there with their Swords in their hands, and the loſs of their bloud endeavour to ſettle the Proteſtant. Religion in <hi>Germany,</hi> and protect it there; he ſays, that it has been the honour of himſelf, and his Family, that they have always been ready to venture their bloud, and their Lives for the advantage of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, as the Examples of his Grand-father, and Father do ſhew, and there never was any thing done by his family, but what was done for the Honour of his
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44371:25"/>
Country, and his Religion; and he ſays, that if any of his former Actions can give any the leaſt ſuſpition of his being Guilty of this or any foul Fact, he is very willing to lay down his Life, and very willing to have it cut off imediately.</p>

               <p>He ſays, that he is very ready upon all occaſions to ſerve the King of <hi>England,</hi> and that he loves the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation ſo well, as always to be ready to do any thing to ſerve them.</p>

               <p>without any intereſt in the World, againſt the will of all my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and I have brought my Brother into <hi>England</hi> to be brought up into the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion to ſhew my Inclinations to the Religion, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ld. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Have you done?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sr. Fra. Winn.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Lord, We have done with our Evidence, and we have no matter of fact to reply unto; but we think it is our duty, conſidering the defence my Lord has made, that we ſhould take ſome care to put the Kings Evidence a little together, it being a caſe of ſuch nature, and ſo cruel and horrid a Murder.</p>
               <p>My Lord, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, I am of Counſel here for the King, and you are Gentlemen upon an inquiry to find out the Offendors in a very great, a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and a wilful Murder. And, my Lord, in relation to the Principals, I need not ſpend your Lordſhip, and the Jurys time about them; for all thoſe three Men, that are indicted as Principals, do my Lord confeſs the fact, tho they do it in a different manner, and tho in forme of Law they are pleaded not Guilty, yet when they come to be asked the Queſtion, there Guilt flys in their faces, and they cannot deny it. So then for thoſe three Men there is no need to ſpend time in repeating the Evidence.</p>
               <p>But, my Lord, that that ſeems to require the conſideration of the Jury is, whether this wicked, and horrid Murder be only circumſcribed in the Guilt of it to thoſe three Men that have confeſſed it, or whether any rational man in the World will beleive upon the account they give themſelves, that they only had a deſign, a ſtudy, or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to kill this Innocent Gentleman. No, my Lord, the thing muſt lie a little deeper, and there muſt be ſome other reaſon, why this barbarous Murder was committed, I would crave your pardon for what I ſay. My Lord, I would not ſpeak any thing, that ſhould miſlead a Jury in matters of bloud, and I think it was rightly ſayd by your Lordſhip, that when a Man is tryed for his Life, We ought all to behave ourſelves ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly as in a matter of weight and moment. And ſo it is I think a very ſerious thing, and a matter of concernment to us all to inquire who hath ſhed Innocent bloud; for ſuch was this poor Gentlemans bloud, that was killed, Innocent bloud.</p>
               <p>My Lord, this <hi>Count</hi> is a very unhappy Perſon to have ſuch a Relation as has been proved to be of the Principals; I will do, my Lord, no wrong in the repetition, if I do, and am miſtaken I crave your direction, I am ſure (you will correct me in it.) Two of the Perſons that are Principals that was Captain <hi>Uratz</hi> and the Polander happen'd to be Perſons Relating to my Lords family as his ſervants. For it is agreed by the Witneſſes that were that <hi>Counts</hi> friends, that I came over into <hi>England</hi> with the <hi>Count,</hi> the laſt time he came over in that private manner, and 'tis likewiſe proved, and not denyed by him, that Captain <hi>Uratz</hi> was frequently with him, not only to the very day when, this blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Fact was done, but after that great crime was committed, I ſay, my Lord, 'tis a very unfortunate thing for this Lord, that thoſe men ſhould have ſo near a Relation to him, who have had their hands in it, and can give no account why they did it.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I do know (and your Lordſhip has juſtly directed us) that no Evidence from one Priſoner, or the Confeſſion of one can charge the others in point of Evidence; but I cannot but take notice that Captain <hi>Uratz</hi> could give no reaſon in the World for it, but as it were for ſome Affront to the <hi>Count</hi> and himſelf. But, my Lord, the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that lyes heavy upon this Lord at the Bar is made up of theſe Particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that here is a Murder committed is plain, then that this Lord did fly is alſo plain, and when he did fly? Gentlemen, he kept himſelf in diſguiſe before that Fact was committed, and whether or no the Reaſons be ſufficient that he has given to your Lordſhip, and the Jury muſt be left to conſideration. He ſays that he had not his Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, that he was not very well, and that he could not drink Wine: Thoſe I take to be the Reaſons given, why my Lord <hi>Coningſmark</hi> did conceal himſelf, till the time after the Fact was comitted.</p>

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44371:26"/>
the Evidence, for that which is truly the Evidence is this Mr <hi>Hanſon,</hi> who is very much converſant in that family, and who did give his Evidence very unwillingly, yet, he did really confeſs that which will go very far in this Caſe; For after he was preſſed ſeveral times (your Lordſhip and the Court, and the Council preſſed him) to tell what was the Reaſon of that diſcourſe he had with the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Reſident, and he was asked, had you any Command from my Lord <hi>Coningſmark?</hi> he anſwered no; but ſays he, I thought it would pleaſe him, if I could have the Opinion of the Agent or Reſident to know what the Laws of <hi>England</hi> were, if ſo be he called Mr. <hi>Thynne</hi> to account, and what the conſequence would be in reference to his deſign upon my Lady <hi>Ogle,</hi> and upon this he does go, and ask the Queſtion of the Reſident.</p>
               <p>Now, what does he mean by this calling to account? We muſt take things accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the reaſon of them. Certainly it was ſome offence that he had taken to Mr. <hi>Thynne,</hi> and that is plain in regard when he was asked what the prejudice did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to Mr. <hi>Hanſon,</hi> was pleaſed to name that great Lady, my Lady <hi>Ogle,</hi> and ſay'd ſhe was mentioned, and he did deſire to know what the Influence of the Laws of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> would be in that matter, if he ſhould call him to account.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I think with ſubmiſſion it carrys this in it, as if he had a purpoſe in his mind to call Mr. <hi>Thynne</hi> to account by quarrelling with him and hazarding him in his Life, I do not undertake, nor would not of myſelf to expound it, but this I will ſay, it muſt ſignify ſomething, and muſt have ſome conſideration, and without all doubt a Perſon of this Lords quality would not let fall ſuch an Expreſſion, but for ſome end and purpoſe.</p>
               <p>My Lord, after Mr. <hi>Hanſon</hi> had given his long Evidence, which came ſo difficultly from him, we traced it down by ſeveral Witneſſes, <hi>Wright, Harder,</hi> and others, that this <hi>Polander</hi> came over as it happened on the <hi>Friday,</hi> (which is a thing that comes mighty cloſe,) upon the <hi>Saturday</hi> he is provided with a Coat and a Sword; On the <hi>Sunday</hi> he committed this inhumane bloudy Fact. Now it is a mighty unfortunate Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance upon this Lord, that this ſhould be a man whom my Lord <hi>Coningſmark</hi> ſhould be ſo very much concerned for, that becauſe he was not come, he ſhould be afraid he had miſcarryed in the weather, to that his anſwer was this, that he was ſent for over by him to look after his Horſes, and he had come a great deal ſooner, if it had not been for the ſtormy weather. But, your Lordſhip obſerves, that it was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three or four Moneths before, and then by his own ſhewing the buſineſs of Mr. <hi>Thynne,</hi> and his Mariage with my Lady <hi>Ogle</hi> was talked of far, and near; and ſo my Lord, it makes the ſuſpition of the malice the greater, that he who has done this bloudy Murder, and has been ſo much under the command of this Lords family, that he ſhould come but two days before, and the <hi>Count</hi> provide him with a Sword that very day, and then that Letter from Captain <hi>Uratz</hi> to <hi>Dr. Harder,</hi> which he carryed to the <hi>Count,</hi> and the <hi>Count</hi> read, but of which he can tell you none of the Contents; that ſpeak ſomething in regard when the Doctor went away, this Polander was ſent to the Captain by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor; but this is certain, however, there was a Sword that was brought by the Cutler, that Sword was carried up to the <hi>Count</hi>'s Chamber, that Sword was delivered afterwards to the Polander; for he had it on the Sunday Morning when he went away with the Boots under his Arm, and the Campagne-Coat upon his Back, with a Buff-Coat under it; and he went out, and never returned till the Fact was committed.</p>
               <p>I ſay my Lord, it carries a vehement ſuſpition, that he was privy to this Murder, becauſe this was a Servant at his Devotion, and your Lordſhip and the Jury ſee what kind of a Creature he is, likely to do any thing, being at the Command of ſo great a Perſon.</p>
               <p>But then my Lord, to come cloſer to the matter (for I will only repeat that which is moſt material) there is the Evidence of the Boy, who I muſt ſay, tells you a very ſenſible Story; he tells you upon what account he came to him, that he was there Ten Days before the Murder was committed; he Swears expreſly, That the Polander lay there the Night before, was there that Morning, went away with the Sword, and Doctor <hi>Harder</hi> with him; that this Murder was committed about Eight a Clock at Night, that Captain <hi>Uratz</hi> came buſtling into the <hi>Count</hi>'s Lodgings, where he lay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, and the Boy by agreement, being to go home every Night, ſtay'd half an hour till paſt Nine, and left the Captain there at that time, and the Captain had been there in the Morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:44371:26"/>
My Lord, ſurely it is a ſtrange thing, and much to be wondered at, that the Captain, who had the management of this Murder, had no where to go for a Refuge, but to his Patron my Lord <hi>Coningſmarke,</hi> reeking hot with Mr. <hi>Thynne</hi>'s blood, when the blow was given within an hour after the Murder committed, (for ſo the Boy ſwears expreſly, for the blow was given at 8 a clock) and afterwards he went to the Doctors to bed about 10 a clock at night, as the Doctor hath confeſſed; I take that for a mighty Evidence. And then my Lord, upon the Monday morning when the Boy comes in, the Count asks him, <hi>What was the matter with the Buſtle in the Street the laſt night?</hi> Will any man in <hi>England</hi> believe, but that he had had earlier news of it? And for what reaſon ſhould he ask the Queſtion, if Mr. <hi>Hanſon</hi> ſpeaks true, who brought the news in from <hi>Whitehall?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the great Queſtion that we wonder ſhould be asked the Boy, is, <hi>What Mr.</hi> Thynne <hi>was?</hi> which certainly was a very odd expreſſion, if we conſider what Mr. <hi>Hanſon</hi> ſays, <hi>That the Count had mentioned him in his diſcourſe, and my Lady</hi> Ogle <hi>too.</hi> One of the <hi>Count</hi>'s Anſwers was, <hi>It could not be imagined that he could ſpeak to a Scullion Boy;</hi> but you ſee the Boy ſwears it, and tells it ſo, as that it is very probable.</p>
               <p>[<hi>We now come my Lord to give an account of his Flight.</hi>]</p>
               <p>The Father of the Boy comes in the morning: And I would obſerve, though he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his buſineſs and his diſtemper brought him over, and that he was ill, and under Cure yet this matter made the place too hot to hold him; ſtay here he durſt not, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately he forgot his Phyſicians preſcriptions, and gave order to his man to ſend away his things. Then the Boy's Father was ſent for, and the Portmantles are given him, and he is told my Lord was going to <hi>Windſor;</hi> but when he came to <hi>Charing-croſs,</hi> the things are put into a Coach in the <hi>Strand,</hi> and from thence they went for <hi>Rotherith</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then came the man at whoſe houſe he lay, and he was a <hi>Swede,</hi> and by the way I would obſerve the Witneſſes are moſt of them my Lord's own Friends, unwilling to tell the truth till we get it, and that very hardly from them. This man was very unwilling to tell his knowledge, but he got him the Cloaths, which Cloaths, by the bulk of the man, one would think would hardly fit the <hi>Count;</hi> but the more he was diſguiſed, the more was his ſecurity; and when he was asked this Queſtion, <hi>Why he deſired to have thoſe Cloaths to ſecure him?</hi> He ſaid at laſt, <hi>It was to prevent Trouble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let us conſider, my Lord, whether the <hi>Count</hi> has given any anſwer to that. My Lord, there is nothing in what he ſaid under pardon. He ſays, <hi>He went away, becauſe he was afraid the People would tear him in pieces, before he could juſtifie himſelf.</hi> If he were innocent, he knew where to go to be ſecure from any hurt from the People; he might have applied himſelf to your Lordſhip, or to any other Magiſtrate. He is ſo ingenious he could not but know he might have protected himſelf under the Government, which protects and ſecures any man whatſoever if he be innocent.</p>
               <p>I have theſe two things more to mention and then I ſhall leave it to your Lordſhip and the Jury; and one is the Evidence of Mr. <hi>Gibbons,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Kid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Kid</hi> gives that, which to me is a very material Evidence of what paſſed when they ſeized him: As they were coming up the River, the <hi>Count</hi> asks him, Whether there were any good Lodgings in <hi>Newgate?</hi> and particularly exppreſſed his care of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, to ask whether he were well lodged. And when he was told that the <hi>Polander</hi> had confeſſed, he ſays he ſeemed on the ſudden to be very much concerned, bit his Cloaths, and threw himſelf along with ſome agony. My Lord, an innocent man needed not to uſe any ſuch actions.</p>
               <p>Then comes Mr. <hi>Gibbons,</hi> who was very inſtrumental in the purſuing of him, and is known to be an honeſt man, he gives this Evidence, That when there was a diſcourſe about Mr. <hi>Thynne,</hi> and his old Maſter the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the <hi>Count</hi> preſently replied, <hi>They meant to have done the Duke of</hi> Monmouth <hi>no harm;</hi> and walking about the room, on a ſudden, burſt out into this expreſſion, <hi>This is a ſtain upon my Blood; but one good Action in the Wars, or lodging upon a Counterſcarp, will waſh it all away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, my Lord, as to what he anſwers to this, I ſay any man may make that evaſion which he would excuſe it by, to ſay that the accuſation is a ſcandal or a ſtain, may be worſe than the guilt of the action: But your Lordſhip and the Jury ſee plainly, If ſo be the thoughts of a man's own heart be that he is guilty, it will break out ſome way or other. Theſe things I only repeat, I leave them to the conſideration of the Jury.</p>
               <p>But when I have ſaid this, there is one thing more, and that is above all relating to the Captain: Says Mr. <hi>Gibbons, I did not know that the Captain had confeſſed, but I did venture to ſay he had;</hi> but the <hi>Count</hi> replied, <hi>He did not believe the Captain had confeſſed.</hi> My Lord, you ſee how the Captain appears before you, and if the <hi>Count</hi> will take upon
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44371:27"/>
him to ſay, he does not believe the Capt. wo<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>onfeſſ; it doth ſtrongly argue he knew as much of the Capt.'s mind, as he himſelf. Then look upon the reſolute behaviour of the Capt. the familiarity he lived in with the Count, that he had always been a dependent upon his Family, it ſhews ſome reaſon for his aſſurance of ſecrecy from the Capt. that he would not confeſs the Author of this moſt notorious Murder, and it lies heavy upon him. My Lord, I look upon the diſcovery of this as a very miraculous thing; And pray conſider, Gentlemen, where ſhall a man go to ſettle his thoughts for the Original buſineſs? Do you (or can you) think it was begun, invented and contrived by yonder three men? To what end or purpoſe; or for what advantage to them? You have heard the Evidence that I have repeated to you; You have heard what this Lord has ſaid for himſelf; how he has fled, and what has been done. My Lord, I will not uſe any thing of argument to perſwade the Jury; but I cannot chuſe but ſay, we know no where to go for the Author of this Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous Fact, nor whom to accuſe as the prime Contriver, but this Count before you. I pray the God of Heaven to direct you in your enquiry; and if I have ſaid any thing amiſs, I beg your Pardon for it.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I did not think to have ſaid any thing more in this caſe; but I muſt crave your Lordſhip and the Juries patience for a few words. As for the three perſons at the Bar, (the <hi>Pole,</hi> the Capt. and the Lieutenant) it is (Gentlemen) very notorious they are guilty of this moſt Helliſh Murder. But all the labour and difficulty of this matter is, how far this Count is Guilty, or not Guilty.</p>
               <p>Pray Gentlemen do but obſerve the nature of this Crime, and the manner of our Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that has been given you. The Crime he is accuſed of, is, for being Acceſſary to a Wilful Murder; Acceſſary before the Fact; Contriving of it, and laying the Train, which theſe perſons were made uſe of to fire. This being ſo, it is almoſt impoſſible to give you that clear light and pregnant proof againſt an Acceſſary, as againſt the Principals. The Principal is he that doth the Fact; that is notorious and open. The Acceſſary is the perſon that prepares the Scheme, contrives the management, firſt ſets the Wheel on work, gives the neceſſary Inſtructions, who lies behind the Curtain. Now, conſidering that, and the nature of the thing, it is Impoſſible to give a clearer Evidence than what you have had.</p>
               <p>Pray Gentlemen do but firſt conſider who hath been the Privadoes and the Intimates of this Count, with whom he has had Conference ſince he came into <hi>England, Hanſon</hi> and Dr. <hi>Frederick,</hi> who are brought as Witneſſes (though unwilling ones) againſt him; the Boy that was imployed by him. He is in no other hands; I cannot hear he was among any other perſons but theſe, and Capt. <hi>Vratz,</hi> and the <hi>Polander.</hi> Theſe are his Company, and thoſe alone with whom he had converſation, Now, Gentlemen, that we ſhould be able to produce theſe very men (that were his only Companions) againſt him as Witneſſes, is a mighty thing, conſidering the privacy he lay in.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Vratz</hi> his moſt intimate privado, he came over with him into <hi>England,</hi> liv'd with him in his firſt Lodging, and was continually with him during his ſtay. So then, what can we expect about this man, (Gentlemen) when he had ſaid his Deſign with all the privacy he could, would have as little Converſation with <hi>Engliſh-</hi>men as he could. It was very craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily laid, that he would converſe with none but thoſe that were privy to his deſign, or had an hand in it in a great meaſure. Then pray conſider how it was carried on, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; <hi>Vratz,</hi> who was the great Commander, and the <hi>Polander,</hi> who was the immediate Actor in it, had been his own Servants. <hi>Vratz,</hi> I ſay, he had a great confidence in; he came over with him; and will not any man believe that this man, who eat of his Bread, who lay in his Family, was a likely man to do this for his ſake that thus cheriſh'd him? For whoſe ſake pray can it be thought to be? Not for his own ſake; for the Capt. tells you he never had any communication or converſation with this unhappy Gent. Mr. <hi>Thynne.</hi> So that if it were as they would have it, that they did it out of reſpect to this Count, who was the Capt.'s Friend, it will turn upon the ſame point, and confirm the ſuſpicion. Why ſhould the <hi>Polander</hi> do it, if he had no reaſon to do it upon his own aacount? for he never ſaw the Face of Mr. <hi>Thynne,</hi> but was brought hood-wink'd in a manner to the Fact.</p>
               <p>Therefore whether it were not done for his ſake, is that which you are to conſider; and as a proof that for the <hi>Count</hi> it was done, I ſhall pitch upon one Circumſtance that will bring it home to his door, and that is, the Evidence of <hi>Hanſon</hi> his Brother's Tutor: And by the way I cannot but repeat it, that this Thread goes through all the Cloth, we have no Witneſſes but thoſe of his own familiar acquaintance and dependance. Now <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> has (though very ſhufflingly) told you, the <hi>Count</hi> and he had ſome diſcourſe about my Lady <hi>Ogle;</hi> and though we cannot come to know all the Circumſtances, yet he does ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44371:27"/>
ſo much as that there was mention made of requiring ſatisfaction of Mr. <hi>Thynne,</hi> or ſome account of him, and what might be the conſequences of the Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in reference to my Lady <hi>Ogle,</hi> in caſe he ſhould call him to account. So far he is plain, though he will not tell what the diſcourſe was; that there was a diſcourſe of my Lady <hi>Ogle,</hi> of Mr. <hi>Thynne,</hi> of asking ſatisfaction of Mr. <hi>Thynne,</hi> or calling him to account, and what the conſequences in Law might be. And pray, Gentlemen, obſerve, being to take advice about this matter, they would not conſult an Engliſh Lawyer, though I ſee one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him now, but a Foreigner, the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Agent; not ask the opinion of one man of this Kingdom. And then he gives you a mighty reaſon for it, That the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Reſident knew very well how to adviſe him in this affair, becauſe he had lived in <hi>England</hi> about 19 years: So that all his Acquaintance and Friends, the managers of the buſineſs, and thoſe conſulted with about it, all Outlandiſh men; I cannot ſay they are all Guilty, but I will ſay this makes our Proof more difficult.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, This being taken notice of as a mighty Circumſtance, I would bring it a little more home to this Gentleman, whom we accuſe as Acceſſary before the Fact. Pray conſider how all along he lay skulking, and hiding himſelf in diſguiſe, and ſhifting his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from place to place. I need not repeat it, but I would deſire you to think of what was concurrent with that very day, and, as it were, concomitant with the very Murder, and that will appear to be ſufficient to ſatisfie any rational man. We are not picking up an Evidence upon flying words, or unconcluding circumſtances, but we offer Facts to you, and Facts are to guide you, you being to compare Facts with Facts. As to his lurking and hiding, this Gentleman gives you no manner of rational account, that he had any buſineſs with any man in <hi>England</hi> that ſhould occaſion his lying private; but only he tells you, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor'd under a Diſtemper that he would not have diſcover'd; and yet take him in that very Diſtemper, and in the proceſs of his Cure, as ſoon as this Fact is over, the next morning he values neither his Diſeaſe, nor his Phyſick, but goes by water, and made an attempt to flie abroad. Will any underſtanding man believe that he came privately into <hi>England,</hi> that he lay ſculking here, that he made uſe of another Name, and other Cloaths, that he ſhould do all theſe things, and run away ſo immediately after the Fact was done, and all onely becauſe of a little Diſtemper of Spots on his Breaſt.</p>
               <p>But then, ſays he, it was reported in the world, and told him the next morning, that the People, the Rabble, would tear him in pieces. He was asked where he had this Report, and he brought up a Tailer, and depended mightily upon it, but the Tailer denied it, and, Gentlemen, he that fails in one thing he ſays, is not to be credited in another without good proof. He ſays that he ſaid no ſuch thing, ſo that Gentlemen this fictitious argument of his fear falls to the ground.</p>
               <p>Then obſerve what follows upon this Villainous Fact; he flies away privately, he goes to a <hi>Swediſh</hi> houſe at <hi>Rotherhith,</hi> from thence by a <hi>Swede</hi> he muſt be put into a Skuller, and that Skuller muſt be towing of him for ſeveral days together, till he come to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> from whence he was to have gone Over Sea. Pray lay all this together, and weigh it well, and ſee if you can imagine any other reaſon for it all, than what we alledge.</p>
               <p>I would obſerve it to you Gentlemen, and pray think of it, what the <hi>Count</hi> has ſaid to you in his own defence in ſo many Languages without proof, muſt paſs for nothing. The Court has had a great deal of patience to hear him, and ſhewn him a great deal of Favor in permitting it; but without proof, I ſay, it all paſſeth for nothing. And what proof he hath made of it, I muſt ſubmit to you; for I will not ſpend your time in running into particulars: And where he has proved any thing, pray compare Facts with Facts, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that concerning the Captain <hi>Vratz,</hi> which is not in my opinion to be anſwered, that he lived with him, that he ſhould be with him on the Sunday morning, that in the evening he ſhould come thither again after the Fact done, that he ſhould be left in his Chamber, and continue in the Houſe ſo long. Will any one believe, that when <hi>Vratz</hi> came over with the <hi>Count</hi> from abroad, lodged with him here, was every day with him in familiar converſation, ſhould come that morning before, and in the evening immediately after, and ſtay with him ſo long, and yet the <hi>Count</hi> be innocent? Nay, will not any man rather abſolutely conclude him an Acceſſary to the Murder.</p>
               <p>Then, Gentlemen, take into your conſideration his Flight, and endeavors to eſcape out of the hands of Juſtice; if there were no more, that is a great evidence of his Guilt, but you have much more, and as ſtrong as you can deſire or expect. He ſays he was afraid of the People; alas he needed not to fear that, he finds a very fair and generous treatment here, he knew the temper of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation well enough, to know they do not preſently flie in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44371:28"/>
mens Faces; and he could not but know, he might, without danger, reſign himſelf up to the Law if he were innocent.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, We have given you a fair and a full Evidence, we have offer'd you ſufficient proof in Fact, and have offer'd no Shams to you; and I do not doubt but you will do right to the Honour of <hi>England,</hi> and the Juſtice of the Nation, which are deeply concerned in this Caſe.</p>
               <p>[<hi>Then there was a great Noiſe made.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Lord Chief-Juſtice. <hi>Look you Gentlemen, The Council for the King have been very large in the repeating of the Evidence, therefore you must not expect from me, that I ſhould go over it again in the ſame method that they have done. I will direct you a little as to ſome Points in Law as to this Caſe. Here is as they tell you truly, a Murder as horrid and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as peradventure can be committed upon any Subject. It is a Murder of a very bad nature, ſo that the repeating of it is enough to make all men abhor it; it needs no aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is in its own nature ſo very barbarous; and thoſe Gentlemen that had a hand in it, muſt certainly needs be aſhamed, and look upon themſelves as not fit to be accounted men, whoever they be that had any hand in it, ſo barbarous and inhumane, and baſe in its own nature, and ſo unworthy of a man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I muſt tell you, Gentlemen, when one man ſhoots another, and two are with him, though they do nothing but come on purpoſe to countenance that evil Fact, that is Murder in them All; All that were preſent are guilty, when ever ſuch an Act is done: And three or four come together, and one does the Fact, and the others ſtand by to countenance it, whether they be there to bring the Party off, or to animate him, and put him into a condition that he may murder and kill, it is murder in All, and they are All as equally guilty, as he that ſhot, or actually gave the blow.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Now as to theſe three perſons here the</hi> Polander <hi>that ſhot,</hi> Vratz <hi>who was with him and ſtop'd the Coach, and</hi> Stern <hi>that was by with them, they do all acknowledge themſelves to be there at this Murder; the leaſt they ſay for themſelves, is, that they came to countenance a fighting with Mr.</hi> Thynne, <hi>that is the leaſt any of them ſay; for Captain</hi> Vratz <hi>makes this his excuſe, that he intended to kill him (as he calls it) fairly, and the others were to ſtand by to let him make the beſt of it; ſo that they All came with a murderous intent, and a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der followed. And I muſt declare this for Law to you, that this is Murder in them All, if you believe themſelves; ſo that I think there is little, very little for you to conſider concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe three men, but according to what they have acknowledged of themſelves both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Council, and here likewiſe in your own preſence, they ſeem All to be guilty of this Murder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The more doubtful Queſtion is concerning Count</hi> Coningſmarke, <hi>that stands here before you, for he was not at the Murder, nor is he charged as Principal; and the Queſtion will be as to him, Whether he commanded, or gave any authority or direction to have this Murder committed; That is the thing that is now charged upon him, and without that he cannot be acceſſary in this Caſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now, Gentlemen, you muſt conſider as to that, ſeveral things are certain and poſitive; That this</hi> Polander <hi>was once his Servant; That he was brought over from Beyond Sea by his Order; That he was given by him to Captain</hi> Vratz; <hi>That</hi> Vratz <hi>was his great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and lay in his Lodging ſome time, though not at this very time. Theſe things are plain: Now what Anſwer is given to this? You hear, he ſays, the</hi> Polander <hi>was taken for him, and hired as a Servant Beyond Seas, knowing that he had skill in Horſes; and the Count having remitted money to buy Horſes, he was willing to have him manage the Horſes, and to have his judgment in them, and ſent for him three months before for that purpoſe, and that he came for that purpoſe; but knowing that the occaſion for which he was to buy his Horſes was paſt over, there being like to be no War, and therefore there would be no occaſion for Horſes, he was willing to part with the</hi> Polander, <hi>as he ſays, is uſual for perſons of Quality in his Countrey to do upon ſuch occaſions, to give their Servants to one another; and ſo having cloathed him, firſt he gave him to Captain</hi> Vratz: <hi>And you hear how much of this is made good by Witneſſes, and how far this is ſatisfactory to you as an excuſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for this, I leave to you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is more too that is very plain: It is apparent that the Capt bid him come to his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after this Murder was committed. According to the calculation of the time, it must be after the Murder, for that was about eight a clock, and he was there about nine. You hear what anſwer the Count gives to that; That he came as formerly he had done, he knowing nothing of this, nor of Mr.</hi> Thynne<hi>'s Murder, and that he did not ſpeak to him concerning</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:44371:28"/>
The next thing, Gentlemen, is, 'Tis plain the Count did lie private when he came to <hi>England;</hi> and he tells you, he brings the Doctour to witneſs it, his occaſion of Privacy was, becauſe he had a Sickneſs which he was loth ſhould be known, having been formerly in ſplendour in <hi>England;</hi> but now, without his Equipage, he would not publickly appear; and he was afraid, if he appeared in Company, he ſhould be inticed to drink high, and that would retard his Cure. And the Doctour tells you, he was under his hands for cure of his Diſeaſe, which was ſome Spots upon his Body.</p>
               <p>It is plain too, that Count <hi>Coningsmark</hi> did go away the next morning after he had heard of the Murther, he acknowledgeth it himſelf; and that he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal himſelf upon the Water, and was taken in ſuch manner as the Witneſſes ſpeak. But withall he tells you the occaſion of this was, A ſtranger here, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Vratz,</hi> as he heard, was accuſed for the Murther, and ſeiſed, and he did not know what this might occaſion to him; how the common People might fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Stranger that was of that man's Acquaintance; and it was through his Fear of the People (leſt they ſhould fall upon him before he could vindicate himſelf) that he withdrew himſelf and concealed himſelf in this manner. As it was told you by the Council it was an unreaſonable fear in him, for there is no ſuch diſorderly proceeding (we thank God) in <hi>England;</hi> But he tells you he was afraid of it; and if he were, being a Stranger, he might not know our Conſtitution ſo well.</p>
               <p>But I muſt tell you another thing for Law, Gentlemen, which was urged by the Council for the King. Captain <hi>Vratz</hi> doth ſay, that he, knowing of an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front that had been given to the Count, and having received an Affront himſelf, he did, without the Count's knowledge, doe this Murther, for Revenge, upon Mr. <hi>Thynne.</hi> It has been ſaid by the Council, it will be all one whether it were with the knowledge of Count <hi>Coningsmark</hi> or not. Now, I muſt tell you, Gentlemen, the Law is not ſo. For if a Gentleman has an Affront given him which he does ſeem to reſent, if any of his Servants officiouſly, without acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him with it, out of too much Zeal and too forward a Reſpect to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Honour, will goe and piſtol and kill him that they apprehend has affronted their Maſter, he not knowing of it, it will not charge their Maſter with any guilt at all. The Law, Gentlemen, is not ſo as was urged, for if it were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Counts knowledge and direction, if a zealous Captain has gone and over-ſhot himſelf, out of reſpect to his Maſter's Honour, when really it was a Diſ-honour to himſelf and all that were acquainted with it, this cannot lie upon him, to make Count <hi>Coningsmark</hi> guilty. But it lies upon me to direct you; for otherwiſe you might ſwallow it as a Maxim, to be all one in Law, which it is not.</p>
               <p>So that it will return to this, Whether here he any Proof that Count <hi>Conings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> did conſent to this Murther, or any waies countenance the Killing of Maſter <hi>Thynne,</hi> or command any of theſe Perſons to doe it.</p>
               <p>Look you, Gentlemen, there are ſome ſuſpicious Speeches that are mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned here of the Count's. One is, that the Boy ſhould ſay that the Count asked him whether men might ride in <hi>London</hi> on Sundaies? You hear what Anſwer is given to that. The Count denieth that he asked any ſuch Queſtion: and to ſhew and prove that ſuch a Queſtion could not likely be asked, he ſaies and proves, by divers perſons, that it was an ordinary thing for himſelf to ride on Sundaies in <hi>Hide-Park</hi> before this Buſineſs long.</p>
               <p>It is alſo ſaid, that when he was taken, he ſhould ſay, that he did believe they intended the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> no hurt: Now that he ſaid theſe words he doth not here deny; but he ſaies he ſpoke it upon the common Report that theſe men had watched the Coach till they ſaw his Grace out of it, and then they did doe this Villany; ſo that he apprehended they had no deſign to hurt the Duke at ill. This is the Anſwer he gives; how ſatisfactory it is; I leave it to you.</p>
               <p>Then as to thoſe other words; That it would reflect upon his Family and ſtain his Bloud, but he preſently recollected himſelf; and ſaid, One brave Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Wars or Lodging upon a Counterſcharp would waſh it off: You hear what he ſays to that: He looked upon it as an Injury to his Family, and it would be ſome ſtain to his Bloud, that he ſhould be accuſed of ſo baſe and

unworthy an Act; but that Accuſation he thought might be waſhed off; and ſo, though he were innocent, it might be looked upon as a Stain, which a brave Behaviour in the Wars would wipe off.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Thus, as near as I can, I have given you an Account of the moſt material things that are objected againſt him, and his Anſwers to them. I muſt leave it to you, whether, upon the Evidence which you have heard, you do believe that this Murther was directed or countenanced by Count <hi>Conings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark.</hi> If it were, he then is guilty as Acceſſary before, and you muſt find it; but if you believe he did not know it till after the Murther was done, then he is innocent, and you muſt acquit him. And upon the whole, Gentlemen, I muſt leave it to you.</p>
               <p>Then, it being late, After an Officer was ſworn to keep the Jury, the Court adjourned for a while; and in half an hour return'd; and ſent for the Jury, who came in and, anſwering to their Names, gave this Verdict.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Recorder.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>You the Priſoners at the Bar, <hi>George Borosky, Chriſtopher Vratz</hi> and <hi>John Stern,</hi> you have been all indicted for the Murther of a Gentleman of great Quality Mr. <hi>Thynne;</hi> a great, an heinous and a crying Crime, that cries aloud for vengeance: You have been brought to your Trial and tried indifferently by a Jury not conſiſting onely of the Country-men of the Party ſlain but compounded of Foreiners and Freeholders of the County too. Theſe impartial Men have found you Guilty, and indeed the plainneſs of your Guilt is ſuch that you your ſelves have acknowledged your ſelves Guilty. For when you were apprehended your Guilt did ſo ſtare in your Faces, and you could give ſo little an account how you had beſtowed that time wherein he was murthered that you were forced to confeſs your intereſt in the Fact.</p>
               <p>It is our Duty to pronounce the Sentence of the Law againſt you upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction; but it is alſo our uſage to open the nature of the Crime for which the convicted Perſon is to ſuffer Death, for the conviction of the Offenders themſelves. Now your Crime is one of the deepeſt die, it is the wilfull ſhedding of innocent Bloud, to which you could be led by nothing but what you are charged with in the Indictment, the motion and ſeduction of the Devil. This Crime of Murther is put into the higheſt and foremoſt rank. When God himſelf had given Laws to the World under the Old Adminiſtration, after the Command of honouring Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother in the next place he forbids Murther. This Crime you have committed and that with the moſt aggravating circumſtances that I have ever known attend any Crime of this Nature. It was committed upon a Gentleman of great Quality, that was ſo far from giving you any provocation to it, that you acknowledge your ſelves you never had any communication with him. It was done upon a Day when you ought to have exerciſed and buſied your ſelves in acts of Piety and religious Worſhip. It was done in the Streets of the City near the King's Royal Palace. But the greateſt circumſtance of all is the doing it in ſuch a manner, that is it was done by way-laying; a ſort of killing the moſt unworthy, the moſt baſe and the moſt ungenerous of all other. For that it gives the party aſſaulted no liberty for any prevention or any defence by any prudence he can uſe; and the conſequence of it is, as much as lies in the Malefactour, to deſtroy as well the Soul as the Body; by ſuch an inſidious Murther to take a Man out of this life before he can have any opportunity to prepare for another life. Therefore in our publick ſolemn Prayers in our Church it has very juſtly and worthily been made part of our Liturgy to pray to be delivered from Murther and ſudden Death.</p>
               <p>You that are ſtrangers in this Countrey if you had been tried and convicted of a breach of our Municipal Laws, the peculiar Laws of this Kingdom, much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence might be ſhewn to you becauſe of your little acquaintance with the Law. But that-is not your caſe, your Offence is a tranſgreſſion againſt the Law of God, written in large Characters in the Nature of Man. It is againſt the Laws of all Nations even your own Country from whence you come, and any other Country whereever you could go are ſevere in their Laws againſt that by which you have broken the Law in ſo foul a Fact. The very Barbarians could ſay, <hi>This Man is a Murtherer and Divine Vengeance will not ſuffer him to live;</hi> ſo that they all think the Divine Juſtice concern'd to revenge it.</p>
               <p>You have ſlain this innocent Gentleman which is but a ſingle diſtemper as it concerns him, but if it ſhould go unpuniſhed it would turn to a peſtilential con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion. If ſuch Aſſaſſinations and Murthers of Perſons ſhould not be ſeverely puniſhed it were a greater woe than ever was brought upon this Kingdom. Therefore it is thought fit by his Majeſty to make his Juſtice ſignal and exemplary upon thoſe that have thus baſely and inhumanely brought themſelves under the conſure of it. That when the fame of this barbarous Action ſhall go abroad his Juſtice ſhall alſo be celebrated upon the Actors, and that this kingdom is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Juſtice.</p>
               <p>I have but one thing more to ſay to you, and that is in tenderneſs to you your ſelves. You are to conſider that you are to receive another Judgment than that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44371:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you will be condemned by here, and that you may be prepared for that is your great and your onely care. Now it is Repentance that is the onely Antidote againſt the ſting of Death. You cannot be found innocent, your ſelves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge your guilt, then let it be your care to be found penitent. For that purpoſe you ſhall have the aſſiſtance of ſome of our learned Divines here, and you will doe well to hearken to their good Counſels. I pray God you may ſubmit to Juſtice patiently, and that your Contrition may be correſpondent to your Crime, that ſo you may obtain pardon and everlaſting favour from God.</p>
               <p>It remains onely that we paſs the Sentence of Law againſt you which is this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That you ſhall go from hence to the place from whence you came, from thence to the place of Execution, where you ſhall be ſeverally hanged by the Neck untill you be dead: And the Lord have mercy upon your Souls.</hi>

            </sp>
            <p>
