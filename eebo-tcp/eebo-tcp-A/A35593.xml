            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And</hi> thereupon Enacted that <hi>Roll</hi> ſhould enjoy the Office for Life, by vertue of the Grant made him by the ſaid Chief Juſtice, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Death or Removal of the Chief Juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mich.</hi> 10 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. Sir <hi>John Finch</hi> was made Chief Juſtice, and upon his coming into that Place by Indenture inrolled in the Exchequer, Sir <hi>John Finch</hi> Covenants and Agrees, that he will not grant any the Offices of <hi>Philizer, Exigenter, Prothonotarie,</hi> Clerk of the Treaſury, or other Offices of that Court to any Perſon, or admit any Perſon to the Execution of theſe Offices, but only ſuch as ſhould be named by the King and his Succeſſors. And would admit and put in to Execute thoſe Places, ſuch Perſons as ſhould be ſo named by the King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hillary Term</hi> 15 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. Sir <hi>John Finch</hi> was removed and made Lord Keeper, and Sir <hi>Edward Littleton</hi> made Chief Juſtice of the Common Bench.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> before his coming in, by Indenture dated 25 <hi>January,</hi> 15 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. made betwixt the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> then Lord Treaſurer, and the Lord <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington</hi> then Under-Treaſurer, Truſtees for the King; and Sir <hi>Edward Littleton</hi> inroll'd in the Exchequer, <hi>Reciting,</hi> That whereas the King did purpoſe to make Sir <hi>Edward Littleton</hi> Chief Juſtice of the Common Bench, Sir <hi>Edward Littleton</hi> did Covenant and agree, That he being admitted to the Office of Chief Juſtice, ſhall not, or will not by vertue of the ſame Office, grant or diſpoſe of the Offices or Places of <hi>Prothonotaries, Exigenters, Philizers,</hi> Clerks of the Warrants, Clerk of the Kings Silver, Clerk or Keeper of the Treaſury, Clerk of the Eſſoines in the ſaid Court, nor admit any Perſon to the Execution without the ſpecial Direction or Commands of the King. <hi>And</hi> that he will from Time to Time grant and diſpoſe all and every of the ſaid Offices falling void, to ſuch Perſon or Perſons as the King ſhall nominate; and him and them according to the Cuſtom of the Court, ſhall and will admit and place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Purſuant</hi> to theſe Agreements, 10 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. and betwixt that and 16 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. there were not leſs than twenty Patents made by his ſaid late Majeſty of theſe Offices, ſome in Poſſeſſion, ſome in Reverſion, as by the Records thereof appearſ and in every of theſe Patents expreſs notice taken of the ſaid Covenant and Agreement, and a Command to the Chief Juſtice for the Time being to admit. One of which Patents is to Lord <hi>John Berkley,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing, That whereas <hi>George Duncumbe</hi> then held the Office of Clerk of the Treaſury by the Nomination and Appointment of the Chief Juſtice <hi>Finch,</hi> to hold ſo long as Chief Juſtice <hi>Finch</hi> ſhould continue Chief Juſtice. And that the ſame <hi>John Finch</hi> had agreed with the King, or others, for the King not to grant that Office to any Perſon, or put any in without the King's Command; and from Time to Time to grant it to ſuch Perſon as the King ſhall name.</p>
            <p>Then Grants the Office of Clerk of the Treaſury to <hi>John Berkley</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> (afterwards Lord <hi>Berkley</hi>) for his Life, to hold (when it ſhould fall void) for his Life with all Fees, <hi>&amp;c. And</hi> by the ſame Patent Names and Appoints him to the ſaid Office.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Commands</hi> by the ſame Patent, as well the ſaid <hi>John Finch</hi> then Chief Juſtice as every other Perſon that afterwards ſhould be Chief Juſtice of that Court, as the ſame ſhould become void, to admit the ſaid Lord <hi>Berkley</hi> under the Chief Juſtice, to that Office. And that theſe Letters Patents ſhould be to the ſaid <hi>John Finch,</hi> and every ſucceeding Chief Juſtice a ſufficient diſcharge for their ſo doing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hill.</hi> 16. <hi>Car.</hi> 1. Chief Juſtice <hi>Littleton</hi> is made Lord Keeper, and the Kings then Attorney, Sir <hi>John Banks,</hi> is made Chief Juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In</hi> the Parliament then holden <hi>Petitions</hi> againſt theſe Patentees, with the Schedule of them annexed, is exhibited. Patentees and their Councel all heard. <hi>The</hi> Opinion of the Judges of the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> and Barons of the Exchequer; Sir <hi>John Brampſton</hi> then Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> Sir <hi>Humphrey Davenport</hi> then Chief Baron, are then taken under their handſ and then</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lords</hi> in Parliament declare, that the Rights and Priviledges truly incident to the Place of Chief Juſtice of the Common Bench ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored and continued. And do Unanimouſly reſolve and order that theſe Offices, naming the Office of Clerk of the Treaſury, do of right belong to the diſpoſition of the Chief Juſtice for the time being. And that the Grants made by Letters Patents, were all Illegal and void in Law. And further ordered that theſe Patents ſhould be brought to the Houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In this Order,</hi> and in the Opinion of the Judges concerning the Clerk of the Treaſury, it is expreſſed,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> the Office of Clerk of the Treaſury is grantable by the Chief Juſtice for the time being, to ſuch perſons as he ſhall nominate <hi>to continue only during the time he continueth Chief Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning one of theſe Offices. <hi>The Office</hi> of <hi>Exigenter</hi> in the vacancy of the Chief Juſtices place, granted by Queen <hi>Mary</hi> to one <hi>Colshall</hi> for Life, in the Rep. of the Caſe in Dyer 175. The Reſolution is in theſe <hi>VVords.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>Quod ad Dominam Reginam Donatio Officii predicti, nullo modo &amp; nullo tempore pertinet, aut pertineat ſed tantummodo ad Diſpoſitionem Capitalis Juſticiarii, pro tempore exiſtentis at incidens Inſeparabilis ad perſonam dicti Capitalis Juſiciarii ſpectans, Et boc Ratione Preſcriptionis &amp; uſus.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>2 <hi>Februarii,</hi> 37 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. four days before his late Majeſties death, another Patent was granted to his Grace the Duke of <hi>Grafton,</hi> conſiſting as the Lord <hi>Berkleys</hi> and the reſt of the forementioned Patents did of two Parts.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. A Grant of the Office of Clerk of the Treaſury to the Lord Duke for his Life.</item>
               <item>2. A Precept and Mandate to every perſon that after the then Chief Juſtice <hi>Jones</hi> removed, ſhould be Chief, to admit the ſaid Lord Duke or cauſe him to be admitted and to put and inſtitute him in <hi>poſſeſſionem Corporalem Dicti officii.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>And to grant and confirm it to him, to be exerciſed by him or his Deputy. <hi>And</hi> to hold it in as ample manner and form, as <hi>John</hi> late Lord <hi>Berk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> held the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eaſter Term</hi> laſt was three years, Chief Juſtice <hi>Jones,</hi> who had put in Mr. <hi>Tench</hi> his Clerk of the Treaſury, was removed, and Chief Juſtice <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingfield</hi> came in, and as Mr. <hi>Tench</hi> hath affirmed, my Lord Duke and Mr. <hi>Tench</hi> applyed to Chief Juſtice <hi>Beddingfield,</hi> and ſhewed him his Graces Patent, <hi>Tench</hi> delivers him the Keys, he is acquainted that his Grace had deputed Mr. <hi>Tench,</hi> and Chief Juſtice <hi>Beddingfield</hi> re-delivers the Keys to Mr. <hi>Tench.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is Probable</hi> that Chief Juſtice <hi>Wright</hi> and Chief Juſtice <hi>Herbert</hi> did the like.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vpon Inquiry,</hi> this Office was never granted by any Chief Juſtice, by Deed or Writing, but his admitting, allowing or approving, is all that is done. <hi>No</hi> other Ceremony requiſite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>From theſe Premiſes it Appears.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That the Kings Grant to my Lord <hi>Berkley</hi> was Illegal and void, and ſo reſolved by the Lords in Parliament and the Judges.</item>
               <item>2. That the Office belongeth to the Chief Juſtice as inſeparably incident to his Perſon. <hi>And</hi> if inſeparably incident, he cannot be diffeiſed or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed of it, If he could 'tis not inſeparable.</item>
               <item>3. That the Patent to my Lord <hi>Berkley</hi> of this Office, as well as the other Patents of the other Offices, do not rely upon the Kings right, but upon the Covenant and Agreement with the ſaid Chief Juſtices to admit and put in the perſons the King ſhould nominate. Elſe why in all theſe Grants is the Agreement mentioned and the Mandatory Clauſes to the Chief Juſtices for the time being, <hi>to admit,</hi> put in, <hi>Grant and Confirm.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. That by the Act of Parliament, Indentures of Covenant, Patents, Opinions of the Judges, and Reſolutions in Parliament, <hi>The Clerk of the Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ceaſeth with the removal of the Chief Juſtice that put him in.</hi> The words of the Act of the opinion of the Judges and Reſolution are expreſs herein. And what other reaſon is there in the Patents for the Mandatory Clauſes not only to the then preſent but to all, and even the Chief Juſtice that afterwards ſhould be, to admit, put in, <hi>Grant and Confirm. This ſhews</hi> that he is out by removal of the Chief Juſtice that admitted him in. And muſt be new put in, or elſe hath neither right or poſſeſſion.</item>
               <item>5. Beſides the poſſeſſion of Offices do in Law follow the right, and he that hath the right, hath in Law the poſſeſſion, and cannot be diſſeiſed or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed thereof without his own conſent, and at his election.</item>
