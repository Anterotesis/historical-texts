            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the fresh slaughters and
of that butcherly murthering that
hathe lately bene committed in a
manner in all the townes of Fraunce, were vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly

stayned the whole Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch nation, that the most

as there flee euery where abroade
Pamphlets written by flatterers of the Courte,
and men corruptly hired for reward, which do

to put the matter in writing as it was truely
done in dede, being wel enabled to haue know
ledge thereof, both by mine owne calamitie,
and by those that with their owne eyes beheld
<pb n="VI" facs="tcp:4447:5"/>
a great part of the same slaughters.</p>
            <p>In the yeare of our Lord. 1561. when there
seemed to be some perill of troubles to arise by
reason of the multitude of suche as embraced
the Religion (which they cal reformed (for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that time the vsuall manner of punishing
such as durst professe that Religion, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
losse and forfeyture of all their goods to
the Kings vse, to burne their bodies) at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of the great Lordes and nobilitie there
was holden an assemblie of the estates in the
Kings house at Saint Germaines in Lay, neare
to the towne of Paris, at which assemblie, in
presence, and with the royall assente of King
Charles the ninth, which now raigneth, it was
decreed, that from thencefoorth it shoulde
not be preiudicaill to any man to professe the
said Religion, and that it should be leefull for
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue publique metings and preachings
for the exercise thereof, but in the suburbs of
townes only.</p>
            <p>At this assemblie, Francis Duke of Guise,
being descended of the house of Loraine, and
at that time Grand master of the Kings hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
was not present. But when he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of this decree, he boyled with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
sorow and anger, and within few dayes
<pb n="VII" facs="tcp:4447:5"/>
after at a little town in Champagne called Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssey,
while the professors of the saide Religion
were there at a Sermon, he accompanied with
a band of souldiers, set vppon them, and slewe
men and women to the number of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth.</p>
            <p>There was amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g these of the Religion (for
so hereafter according to the vsuall phrase of
the french tong we intend to call them) Lewes
of Burbon of the bloud royall, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Prince of Conde, after the name of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
towne, a man of great power by reason
of his kinred to the King. Therefore when the
Duke of Guise most vehemently striued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that lawe, and as much as in him lay, did
vtterly ouerthrowe it, and troubled the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
quiet thereby stablished, Gaspar de Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligni
Admirall of France, and Francis d'Ande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot
his brother, Captaine of the Fantarie, and
other Princes, noble men and Gentlemen of
the same Religion, come dayly by heapes to
the Prince of Conde, to complaine of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
boldnesse and vntemperate violence
of the Duke of Guise.</p>
            <p>At that time Catherine de Medices Pope
Clements brothers daughter, and mother of
King Charles, borne in Florence a Citie of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talie,
<pb n="VIII" facs="tcp:4447:6"/>
had the gouernance of the Realme in the
Kings minoritie. For though by the lawe of
Fraunce, neither the inheritance nor the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of the realme is graunted to women,
yet through the cowardly negligence of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonie
King of Nauarre, the said Catherine de
Medices the kings mother, against the custome
of the realme, was ioyned with him in that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of protectorship. She fearing the presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and fierce pride of the Guisians, wrote to
the Prince of Conde with hir owne ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: which
letters are yet remayning, and at the assemblie
of the Princes of Germanie at Franckforde,
holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder Ferdinand the Emperoure, were
produced and openly read about ten yeares
past: wherein she earnestly besought, him in so

but to account both the mother and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
that is, both hir selfe and the King; and
the Kings brethren, committed to his faith and
naturall kindnesse, and that he should with all
speede, prouide for their common safetie: as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
him, that she would so imprint in the
Kings mind his trauell taken in that behalfe,
that he should neuer be loser by it.</p>
            <p>VVithin few dayes after the Duke of Guise
wel knowing how great authoritie the name of

part of the nobilitie of Fraunce maruellously
troubled with it, the Prince of Conde by aduise
of his friends, thought it best for him to take
certaine townes and furnishe them with garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
which was the beginning of the first ciuill
warre. For the Prince of Conde alleaged the
cause of his taking armour, to be the defence of
the Kings Edict, wherein consisted the safetie
of the common weale, and that it could not be
repealed without most assured vndoyng of the
nation of Fraunce, and destruction of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,
by reason of the exceeding great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of those that daylie ioyned themselues to

mothers singular care (as was reported) for
conseruation of peace and repressing the rage
of the Guisians. Vpon which opinion it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
that aboue twentie thousande men ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
regarde onelye to the Queenes inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ioyned themselues to the side of those of
the Religion, and to the defence of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
whiche at that time had besieged the

            <p>After certayne battayles and manye losses
on both partes, and the Duke of Guise slaine,
within a yeere peace was made with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that they of the Religion shoulde haue
free libertie thereof, and shoulde haue assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
and preachings for the exercise of the
same in certeyne places.</p>
            <p>This peace continued in force, but not in
all places, during fyue yeeres: for in the most
townes &amp; iurisdictions, the Officers that were
affectionate to the Romishe side, whom they
commonly call Catholikes, did all the displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
they could to those of the Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

               </gap>,
commonly called Duke of Alua, was lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
an armie not farre from the frontiers of
Fraunce, against those of the lowe countrey
which embraced the reformed Religion; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainste
the wyll of the Kyng of Spayne, the
Queene mother caused to be leuied and
brought into Fraunce sixe thousande Switzers
for a defence, as she caused it to be bruted, but
as the successe hath proued, for this intent, that
the Prince of Conde, the Admirall and other
noble men of the Religion, if they escaped the
treasons prepared for them, and listed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende
themselues by force, and trie it by bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle,
might be sodaynely oppressed ere they
were prouided. For the courtiers whiche then
had the managing of these matters, dyd not at
that time well trust the souldiers of Fraunce.
Many things pertayning to the course of that
time, and the renewing of the warre, must here
for hast to our present purpose be necessarily
omitted.</p>
            <p>VVhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the warre had endured about sixe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths,
pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce was made with the same co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions
that we haue aboue rehearsed, that all men
should haue free libertie to follow and professe
the Religion reformed. For this was euer one
<pb n="XII" facs="tcp:4447:8"/>
and the last condition vpon all the warres. But
within fewe dayes or monethes after, it was
playnly vnderstoode, that the same peace was
full of guile and treason, and finally, that it was
no peace, but most cruell warre cloaked vnder
the name of peace. For forthwyth all those
townes which they of the Religion had yelded
vp, were possessed and strengthened with gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons
of souldiers of the contrary side, sauing
onely one towne on the sea coast in the partes
of Xantoigne commonly called Rochell. For
the men of that towne aboute two hundreth
yeares past had yelded themselues to the Kings
power and allegeance, with this condition, that
they should neuer be constrayned agaynst their
will to receyue any garrison souldiers.</p>
            <p>Also the Prince of Conde and the Admirall
were aduertised, that there was treason agayne
prepared to entrap them by Tauaignes, a man
giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to murther and mischiefe, which had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bene made Marshall of Fraunce, and that if
they did not spedely auoyde the same, it should
shortly come to passe, that they should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
and taken by him, and deliuered vp to
the crueltie of their aduersaries.</p>
            <p>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> on the receyt of these aduertisementes,
they immediatly make hast to Rochell, carying
<pb n="XIII" facs="tcp:4447:8"/>
with them their wiues and yong childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which
was the beginning of the third ciuill warre, the
most sharpe and miserable of all the rest.</p>
            <p>There was at that time in the court, Charles
Cardinall of Loraine, brother to the Duke of
Guise, which (as is aboue sayde,) was slayne in
the first warre, one accompted most subtill and
craftie of all the rest, but of a terrible, cruell and
troublesome disposition, so as he was thought
intollerable euen at Rome it selfe. This man,
they of the reformed Religion reported to be
the moste sharpe and hatefull enimye of their
profession, and him they abhorred aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the crueltie of his nature, and named
him the firebrande of all ciuill flames. He at the
beginning of the third ciuill warre, persuaded
the King to publish an Edict, that no man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
any Religion but the Romishe or Popish,
and that whosoeuer wold embrace any other,
should be compted as traytours. In that same
Edict Printed at Paris, this sentence was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely
conteyned, and for the strangenesse of
the matter, and for that it stayned the Kyngs
name with the most dishonorable spot of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie
and breache of faith, it was in other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
afterwarde omitted. And it was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then declared, that albeit the King had in
<pb n="XIIII" facs="tcp:4447:9"/>
manye Edictes before that time permitted the
freedome of Religion, yet this meaning euer
was to reteyne and cause to be reteyned of all
men, the onely Romishe or Popishe Religion
within his Realme.</p>
            <p>After manie ouerthrowes on both partes
giuen and receyued, whereas the ende of this
thirde warre was thought likely to be the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
by reason of the breache of sayth in the
yeeres before, and on the other side the state of
the Realme by reason of the wast that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
were broughte vnto, and the extreme po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie
of the meane people and husbandmen,
did require some treatie of composition, the
King sent messangers to the Admirall, to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
vnto him in the Kings name, that the King
himselfe had at length founde out a most sure
way of peace and concorde, namely that the
armies of both partes ioyned togither, shoulde
goe into the lowe countrey against the Duke
of Alua, which had been the author of the late
calamities in Fraunce. He signified further, that
he had great causes of querels against the king
of Spayne, and this principally, that he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaded
and helde by force, sodenlye slaying all
the souldyers there, an Island of the newfound
world, called Florida, which had been taken by
<pb n="XV" facs="tcp:4447:9"/>
the French and kept vnder his dominion: and
likewise the Marquesdome of Finall, the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitantes
whereof had but a little tyme before
yelded themselues to the Kings subiection and
allegeance. He said that the most stedfast band
of concorde shoulde be that forein warre, and
that there could no other better meane be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised
to drowne the memorie of the former
dissentions in eternall forgetfulnesse.</p>
            <p>To the performance hereof, he sayd it was
a matter of most apte opportunitie, that Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douic
counte of Nassaw, brother to the Prince
of Aurenge, had been nowe two yeeres in the
Admiralls camp, to whome the Admirall gaue
principall credit in all things, and that by him
and his fellowes of the lowe countrey, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
whom he vnderstoode to fauour his part,
it might easily be broughte to passe that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
Cities mighte be surprised, and thereby
great aduantage be attayned to the atchieuing
of the warre.</p>
            <p>The Admirall hearyng these thyngs was
maruellously troubled. For albeit he doubted
not of the Kings fidelitie, yet therwithall many
things fell into his minde to be considered: as
the power of the Cardinall and the rest of the
Guisians, who were well knowne to haue ben
<pb n="XVI" facs="tcp:4447:10"/>
at all times most affectionate to the Kyng of
Spayne. For the Duke of Guise had lefte a
sonne, a very yong man, called Henry, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the Queene had giuen all the offices and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of honor that his father had borne before,
beyng vnfit thereto by age, and against the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
lawes and customes, and also through the
traiterous infidelitie of certayne of the Kings
counsaylers, whome she knew for their affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Popish Religion to be most addicted to
the Spanishe King, and that diuers of them
had great yeerely pensions of him, and did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close
vnto him the affaires of the Realme. He
remembred howe hereby it came to passe, that
the same Kings Embassador (whiche among
strange nations seemed vtterly incredible) was
admitted into the priuie Counsell of Fraunce,
and that one Biragio <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Lumbard, and (as it is
reported) a traytour to his owne countrey, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
altogither vnlearned, and specially ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt
of the ciuill lawe, was yet for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie
of his witte aduanced to so great honour,
that he executed the Chauncellers office, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael
Hospitall being displaced, a man knowne
to be such a one, as there was not in all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of men any eyther more wise, or more
learned, or more zelously louing his countrey.
<pb n="XVII" facs="tcp:4447:10"/>
Herewithall he considered the slaunderous ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uillations
of his aduersaryes, to whome hereby
might seme an occasion giuen, as if the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
were of a troublesome nature, and coulde
not abide any quietnesse, nor could long reste
at home without some tumultuous stir. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
the messangers replyed as they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and therewithall alleaged this cause of so
sodayne hatred against the Spanishe King, that
one Albenie late returned out of Spaine, had
infourmed the King and the Queene mother
for certaintie, that King Philip a few moneths
before, had poysoned his wife the Frenche
Kings sister, and had spred rumors of hir tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout
all Spaine, such as for the honour of
manye persons are meete not to be disclosed.
But nothing moued the Admirall so much as
the cherefull earnestnesse of Lodouic of Nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw,
who as sone as he was aduertised of that
purpose of the King, omitted nothing that he
thought mighte serue to encourage the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall
therevnto.</p>
            <p>The Admirall perswaded hereby, nothing
fearing the infidelitie of those of the Courte,
gaue his minde to hearken to compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And so was the third ciuill warre ended,
and the peace concluded wyth the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
<pb n="XVIII" facs="tcp:4447:11"/>
that were before, that euerye man
shoulde haue free libertie to vse and professe
the Religion.</p>
            <p>VVithin few moneths after this, diuers Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Germanie, that fauored the Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed,
and among those the three Electors,
the Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sgraue, the Duke of Saxonie, and the
Marques of Brandeburge, sent their Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
into France to the King, to gratulate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him for the newe reconciliation of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.
And bycause they accompted it greatly to
behoue them selues that the same concorde
should remaine stedfast and of long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
they promised, that if any would for that
cause procure trouble, or make warre vppon
him either within his owne dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
they and their followers shuld be ready to
defend him. To this embassage the king firste
by words, and afterward by a booke subscribed
with his owne hande, answered and gaue his
faith, that he would for euer most sacredly and
faithfully obserue his Edict of pacification.</p>
            <p>Hereby so much the more willingly the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall
suffered him selfe to be drawne to the
sayd purposes, for the low countrey, although
oftentimes calling to minde the nature of the
Queene mother, he vsed to say to diuers, and
<pb n="XIX" facs="tcp:4447:11"/>
specially to Theligny, to whome he afterwarde
maried his daughter, that he greatly suspected
the rolling wit of that woman. For (said he) so
soone as she hath brought vs into that prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against the lowe countrey, she will leaue
vs in the midst.</p>
            <p>Neuerthelesse, the Counte of Nassaw wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
to his brother, and they conferring their
aduises together, send messengers to the King,
that if it please him to deale with the matter of
the lowe countrey, they will shortly so do, that
he shall by their many and greate seruices, well
perceyue their affection and deuotion towarde
him. The King writeth againe to them in most
louing termes, saying that their message most
highly pleased him, and he gaue to them both
his harty thanks.</p>
            <p>About the same time Maximiliane the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peroure
pitying the estate of the Prince of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renge
(as he said) treated by his Embassadours
with the King of Spayne, and had in manner
obteyned, that the Prince should haue all hys
goodes restored vnto him, but with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that he should haue no house within the
territorie of the lowe countrie, but settling his
residence and dwelling elsewhere, he shoulde
freely enioy all his reuenewes. VVhich matter
<pb n="XX" facs="tcp:4447:12"/>
being reported to the French King, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
sent messengers to the Prince of Aure<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge
willing him to loke for nothing by that dealing
of the Emperour, saying that it was but a fraud
and guilefull deuise intended for this purpose,
only to breake vp his leuying of souldiors that
he had begon in Germanie: and assuring him,
that if he woulde credite and followe him, hee
would giue him ayde sufficient to recouer hys
estate.</p>
            <p>The Prince of Aurenge perswaded by these
promises of King Charles, continued his mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and determined a while to bear the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
thogh they were heauie to him, while such
things as were necessarie for the warre, were in
preparing. In the meane time Lodouic in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised
apparell went to Paris to the King. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as the season of the yeare by this time
seemed not commodious to leuie an armie,
for the winter was at hande, by assent they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
the matter till the next sommer.</p>
            <p>These things thus hanging, the Prince of
Aurenge his capitaynes by sea, did oftentymes
set vpon the Spaniards and Portingals, &amp; such
ships as they toke they brought into the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
of Rochell, which then was in the power
of the Prince of Condees part: and there they
<pb n="XXI" facs="tcp:4447:12"/>
openly vttered and solde their prizes to the
men of the towne and other merchantes of
Fraunce, wherevppon the Embassadoure of
Spayne made often complaintes to the Kings
priuie councell.</p>
            <p>And forasmuche as they thought it very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaylable
to this enterprise, that Elizabeth
Queene of Englande might be broughte into
league with them, the King comitted the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in that matter to the Admirall. For, a fewe
moneths before, the King had with most swete
alluring letters, gotten him to the Court, where
he was most honorably entertayned: and to
take from him all occasion of distrust vppon
his aduersaries, or of otherwise suspecting of
the Kings or Queene mothers affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, first, all the Guisians of a set purpose
departed the Court. Then the King gaue the
Admirall free libertie to take with him what
companie and with what furniture he would:
and bycause it was thoughte that he had more
confidence in the Marshall Cosse, than in the
rest, therefore the King commaunded the saide
Marshall to be euer at hand with the Admirall,
and to assist him in the Kings name if any nede
were.</p>
            <p>The matter of the league with Englande,
<pb n="XXII" facs="tcp:4447:13"/>
the Admirall so diligently and industriously
handled, that within short space after by Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours
sent, and by faith giuen and recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and othes solemnely taken on both parts,
it was confirmed. Concerning the procurement
of other leagues and amities, suche as mighte
seeme to further the enterprise of the low cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
the Admirall also trauelled in the kings
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ame, and by his commandemente, and had in
a manner brought all these things to an ende.
And of all those leauges, the first and principall
condition was, that the libertie of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shuld
continue, and that the king shoulde most dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
and sincerely obserue this Edict of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification.</p>
            <p>Though these things seemed to be handled
secretly, yet by the letters both of Biragio the
vicechancellor, of whom we made mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and of Moruilliers whom for his hipocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
leanenesse children commonly called the
Chimera or bugge of the Court, and by aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements
of Cardinal de Peiue, a man most fit
either to inuent or execute any treason, they
were caried to the Byshop of Rome, who by
aduise of his Cardinals sent by and by one of
their number, called Alexandrine, in the midst
of most sharpe winter into Fraunce, with these
<pb n="XXIII" facs="tcp:4447:13"/>
instructions, to perswade the king to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the societie of the league of Trent, whereof
the first and principall article was, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federats
should ioyne their powers and make
warre vpon the Turks and Heretikes, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
by the name of Heretikes, all those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that did permitte the vse of the reformed
Religion within their dominions.</p>
            <p>The Cardinall Alexandrine was honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
receyued in the courte, but yet dismissed
without atchieuing his purpose. For so was it
bruted among the people, and commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued
throughout Fraunce: albeit he himselfe
secretly seemed to returne very mery &amp; chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to the Pope: and as it is reported, did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
say that he receyued such aunswere of the
King as was needfull not to be published, and
that the King and Queene mother had largely
satisfied him.</p>
            <p>Forasmuch as it was thought a matter great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
auayling to the enterprise of the lowe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
to sende certayne ships into the Englyshe
Seas, that if any ayde shoulde be sent into the
lowe countrey to the Duke of Alua oute of
Spayne, it might so be stopped, Strozzi and the
Baron de la Guarde were appoynted for that
purpose, to whome the king gaue in comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
<pb n="XXIIII" facs="tcp:4447:14"/>
to rigge for the certayne ships of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux
and Rochell, well armed and well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted,
and to prouide with all spede al things
needfull for those ships. The Ambassador of
Spayne somewhat moued with this preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
made diuers complaints to the kings coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
on the behalfe of the king his master, and
yet neuer receyued any other answere, but that
the king, thought it not likely, and that he wold
send Commissioners to Burdeaux and to Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell,
with letters and commaundemente that
there shuld be no preparation made to the sea,
and if any had bene made, it should be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of. VVhat instructions were secretlye and
closely vnder hand giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to these two captaines
of that nauie, we do not certaynly know. But
this no man can doubte of, but that they had
commission to distresse all such ships wherein
any Spanishe souldiers should be transported
into the lowe countrey, and that all this prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to the sea, was ordayned against the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
king and the Duke of Alua.</p>
            <p>And moreouer that the Admiral at the same
time receiued commaundement fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the king,
to send espials into Peru, an Islaind of the new
found world, most plentifull of gold aboue all
the other, now being in the Spaniards domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="XXV" facs="tcp:4447:14"/>
to learne if there were any good enterprise
to be attempted or atchieued for the get<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing
of it. VVhich matter was committed to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
gentleman, one of the Admirals trayne,
who went thither accompanyed with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
Portingall, a man most skilfull of those
Nauigations, whome the Admirall had ioyned
with him by the kings commaundement, and
is not yet returned.</p>
            <p>Nowe it can not be expressed how manye
and how great tokens of most louing mynde
the king at that time shewed to the Admirall,
and to the Countie Rochfoucault, and to
Theligny, and to the rest of the chiefe noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the Religion. First, all such things as in
the former warres had bene taken away in the
townes, fermes and castels of the Admirall &amp;
d' Andelot, the king caused to be sought oute
and restored. If there were any other whome
the king vnderstoode to be beloued and estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of the Admirall, or to haue attayned anye
speciall honour in the sayde late warres, those
he liberally benefited and rewarded. To the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall
himself he commaunded one day to be
giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a hundred thousand pounds of his owne
treasure in recompence of his former losses.
VVhen his brother the Cardinall Chastillion,
<pb n="XXVI" facs="tcp:4447:15"/>
endowed with many great and welthie bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
was departed his life, the king gaue him
the fruites of one whole yeare. Also the kyng
wrote to Philibert Duke of Sauoy, that he
should do him a most acceptable pleasure, if he
did not onely deale more gently with those
that in the former warres had ayded those of
the Religion, but also would vse clemencie and
mildenesse toward all other that professed the
same Religion within his dominions.</p>
            <p>And for that there was old enmitie betwene
the Guisians and the Admirall, wherby it was
to be doubted that perillous contentions wold
arise in the Realme of Fraunce, the king wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it to be signified to them both in his name,
that they should for his sake and the common
weales, giue ouer those displeasures, and he
prescribed them a certaine fourme of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
and agrement, the same whereof the
foundations had bene layed almost sixe yeares
before in the towne of Molins, where the king
calling to him the greatest estates of his realme
after consultation and deliberation had vpon
the matter, pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced the Admiral not guiltie
of the death of the Duke of Guise, wherwith
he was charged by the yong Duke of Guise
and his kinsmen: and so the king by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise
<pb n="XXVII" facs="tcp:4447:15"/>
of his Counsell had ended that contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the Cardinall of Loraine (who
as we haue sayd was the very forger of all the
former warres) to take away al ielousie of new
practises, was departed to Rome, &amp; toke with
him his familiar friend the late created Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Peluey, one reputed a most subtil &amp; craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnder prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of goyng to the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a newe Pope in place of the olde Pope
then lately deceassed.</p>
            <p>But there was none greater and more assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of publique peace &amp; quietnesse than
this, that the king purposed to giue hys sister
Margaret in marriage to the Prince Henry the
so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of the Queene of Nauarre, which Prince
had in the last warre defended the cause of the
Religion, and bene soueraigne of their armie.
VVhiche mariage the kyng declared, that it
should be the most streight bond of ciuill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde,
and the most assured testimonie of his
good will to those of the Religion.</p>
            <p>Yea, and also bicause it was alleaged that the
sayd Prince Henrie was restrayned in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
so as he might not marrie the Lady Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet
being of a contrary Religion, a Catholike
and giuen to the rites of the Romish Church,
<pb n="XXVIII" facs="tcp:4447:16"/>
the king for aunswere sayd that he would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
hir of the Popes lawes, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the crying out of all his courtiers to
the contrary, he permitted him, that withoute
all ceremonies, in the porch of the great church
of Paris the mariage shoulde be celebrate in
such a fourme as the ministers of the refour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Church misliked not.</p>
            <p>VVhiche thing being by reporte and letters
spread through the world, it cannot be expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
howe muche it made the hearts of those of
the Religion assured and out of care, and howe
it cast out al feare &amp; ielosies out of their minds,
what a confidence it brought them of the kings
good will toward them: Finally, how muche it
reioyced forreine Princes and states that fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the same Religion. But the Admirals minde
was much more stablished by a letter which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the same time Theligny brought him with
the kings owne hand and sealed, wherein was
conteined, that whatsoeuer the Admirall shuld
do for the matter of the intended warre of the
lowe cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ntrey, the king would allow and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the same, as done by his owne commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
About that time Lodouic of Nassaw with
the Queene of Nauarre a Lady most zelously
affected to the Religion, came to the Frenche
<pb n="XXIX" facs="tcp:4447:16"/>
Courte. The league was made betweene king
Charles and the Prince of Aurenge, and the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
thereof put in writing. The mariage was
appointed to be holden in the towne of Paris.
For whiche cause the Queene of Nauarre
during those fewe dayes repaired thether to
prouide things for the solemnitie of the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
For the same cause the king sente to the
Admirall one Cauaignes, a man of an excellent
sharpe witte, whome for the Admirals sake the
king had aduanced to great honoure, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Admirall to go before to Paris, as well
for the said preparation, as also for the matter
of the warre of the lowe countrie, promising
that he himselfe would within fewe dayes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
after him: assuring him that there was
now no cause for him to feare the threatnings
and mad outrages of the Parisians. For in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as the same towne is aboue all other gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to superstitions and is with seditious prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings
of Monks and Friers dayly enflamed to
crueltie, it is hard to expresse how bitterly they
hated the Admirall and the professors of that
Religion. VVherto was added a griefe of their
mind conceiued certaine dayes before, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of a certaine stone crosse gilted and builte
after the manner of a spire steeple, commonly
<pb n="XXX" facs="tcp:4447:17"/>
called Gastignes crosse, whiche the Admirall
with great earnest sute obtayned of the king to
be ouerthrowne: for he alleaged, that being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
in the midst of the rage of the ciuill
warre, as it were in triumph to the reproch of
one of the Religion, it was a monumente of
ciuill dissention, and so a matter offensiue to
peace and concord.</p>
            <p>The King well knowing this deadly hate of
the Parisians to the Admirall, wrote his letters
to Marcell the prouost of the marchauntes
(whiche is the highest dignitie in Paris) with
sharpe threatnings if there should be raised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
stirre or trouble by reason of the Admirals
comming. To the same effect also the Duke
of Aniow the kings brother, and the Queene
mother wrote to the same Marcell and the rest
of the magistrates of Paris, so that nowe there
seemed vtterly no occasion lefte for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
to feare or distrust. And within few dayes
after, the king sente Briquemault a man of
greate vertue and estimation, to the Admirall,
with the same instructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, saying that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the lowe countrey could not well be delt
in without his presence.</p>
            <p>The Admirall perswaded by thus many
meanes, and filled with good hope and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
<pb n="XXXI" facs="tcp:4447:17"/>
determined to go to Paris, where so sone
as he was ariued and had bene honorably and
louingly entertayned of the king and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
and the Queene mother, and consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
entred among them about the preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the low cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, he declared to the king
at large, how the Duke of Alua was in leuying
of great power, and preparing an armie, and
that if the king should dissemble his purpose, it
would come to passe that many thereby wold
shew themselues slower and slacker to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise,
and that nowe were offered greate
meanes to do good, whiche if he let slippe, hee
should not so easily recouer the like againe
hereafter. And therefore it was best to take the
aduantage of this opportunitie.</p>
            <p>A fewe dayes before, Lodouie of Nassaw
wente secretly into the frontiers of the lowe
countrey, and toke with him as partners of his
iourney and priuie to his counsell thre Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of great credite with the Admirall, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Saucourt, la Noue, and Genlis, to whom the
king had giuen in charge to see if they coulde
by any meanes atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt and possesse any townes
bordering vppon his realme. They gathering
diuers other gentlemen into their companie,
went speedily into the lowe countrey, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall
<pb n="XXXII" facs="tcp:4447:18"/>
not knowing of it. VVho as soone as he
vnderstode of their going thether, wrote vnto
them that he much maruelled what they me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
saying that he well knewe there coulde be no
power gotten readie before .xl. dayes end and
that they should be wel aduised to do nothing
rashly, nor to ouerthrowe with hast their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises
that seemed not ripe to be executed.</p>
            <p>The countie of Nassaw inflamed with the
sighte and desire of his countrey, and fearing
the mutablenesse of the king, did firste at the
soden set vppon Valentiennes, but being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed
by the Spanish souldiers that were in
garrison in the Castell, he hastily departed to
Montz, and toke the towne, being a place ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
strong by nature and well furnished with
all things necessarye for the warre. VVhiche
thing beyng by reporte and messangers spred
abrode in the lowe countrey, and caried into
Fraunce and Germanie, both encouraged all
them of the Religion with great hope, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
seemed to haue now playnely and openlye
deciphred &amp; disclosed the mind of the French
king. Moreouer Genlis returning to Paris,
when he had made reporte to the king of all
the matter as it had proceded, easily obtayned
of him, that by his assent he might leuie cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="XXXIII" facs="tcp:4447:18"/>
bandes of footemen and horssemen of
Fraunce, and carie them to succoure Montz.
But by the way when he was entred into the
bounds of the lowe countrie, hauing with him
to the number of foure thousand footemen,
and aboute foure hundreth horssemen, they
were beset by the Duke of Alua, and the most
parte of them distressed: which thing was well
knowne to haue ben wrought by the meanes
of the Guisians, which by dayly messages and
letters, aduertised the Duke of Alua of theyr
purposes and preparation. VVhich falsehod of
theirs, many most affectionate to the Romish
Religion, were highly offended with, bycause a
great number addicted to the same Romishe
Religion were in that companie.</p>
            <p>VVith this losse, and with the rescue of the
towne of Valentiennes, the King seemed to be
much troubled, for he feared least his counsels
being disclosed to the Spanish king, would at
length breede some cause of querel and warre.
Howbeit, when he began to remember, that a
great parte of his secrets was already reuealed
to the Duke of Alua, he oftentimes resolued
to vtter his minde plainely, and to make open
warre. But he was withdrawne from that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
by certaine men whiche the Admirall had
<pb n="XXXIIII" facs="tcp:4447:19"/>
long before conceyued, that they would so do.
Howbeit, he gaue the Admirall libertie to send
whatsoeuer he thoughte meete to further the
Prince of Aurenge his enterprise, and as great
supplie either of footemen or of horssemen as
he could to the armie which the Prince of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renge
had leuyed in Germanie. VVhen the
Admirall for that cause had made request that
he might leauie thirtie troupes of horssemen,
and as many ensignes of footemen, he easily
obtayned it.</p>
            <p>For the entertainement of these footemen
it behooued to haue money, wherefore at the
request of the Admirall, the king called for his
Tresurer and commanded him to deliuer to
the Admirall so much money as the Admirall
should thinke meete, and charged him, that he
should not in any wise after the vsuall manner
of the accompts of finances, write the causes of
the receipt, but only set it downe in this forme:
This summe of money was payde to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall
suche a day by the kings commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for certayne causes which the king hath
commaunded not to be written: and to thys
warrante the King subscribed with hys owne
hand.</p>
            <p>Also the King wrote to Monducet, his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadoure
<pb n="XXXV" facs="tcp:4447:19"/>
in the lowe countrey, to trauell as
earnestly as he could, for their deliuerance, that
were taken at the ouerthrowe of Genlis, which
commaundment it is said that Monducet did
most faithfully and diligently execute.</p>
            <p>Not long before this, Ioane Queene of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre
aboue mentioned, died in the Courte at
Paris, of a sodaine sicknesse, beeing aboute the
age of fortie and three yeares, where, as the sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition
was great that she died of poyson, and
hir body was sort hat cause opened by the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
there were no tokens of poyson espied.
But shortly after, by the detection of one. A. P.
it hath bene found that she was poysoned with
a venomed smell of a pair of perfumed gloues,
dressed by one Renat the Kings Apothicarie an
Italian, that hath a shop at Paris vppon sainte
Michaels bridge, neare vnto the pallace: which
could not be espied by the phisitions which did
not open the head nor loked into the brayne.
It is well knowne that the same man about cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
yeares past, for the same intente gaue to
Lewes Prince of Conde a poysoned poman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which the Prince left with one le Grosse
his Surgion: le Grosse delited with the same,
was by little and little poysoned therewith, and
so swelled, that he hardly escaped with his life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="XXXVI" facs="tcp:4447:20"/>By hir deathe, the Kingdome came to the
Prince Henrie hir sonne, to whom as is aboue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
the Kings sister was promised and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted.</p>
            <p>Things being as it seemed throughout all
Fraunce in most peacible estate, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
of all degrees well established, the day was
appointed for the marriage of the king of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre,
which day all they that fancied the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
esteemed so muche the more ioyfull to
them, bycause they sawe the King wonderfully
bent therevnto, and all good men iudged the
same a most assured pledge and stablishmente
of ciuill concord, whereas on the contrary part,
the Guisians and other enimies of common
quietnesse greatly abhorred the same marriage.</p>
            <p>VVhen the day came, the marriage was with
royall pompe solemnized before the greate
Churche of Paris, and a certaine fourme of
words so framed, as disagreed with the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of neither side, was by the kings comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
pronounced by the Cardinall of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon
the king of Nauars vnkle: and so the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie
celebrate with greate ioy of the king
and all good men, the bride was with greate
trayne and pompe led into the Church to heare
Masse, and in the meane time the bridegrome
<pb n="XXXVII" facs="tcp:4447:20"/>
who misliked these ceremonies, together with
Henry Prince of Conde, sonne of Lewes, and
the Admirall, and other noble men of the same
Religion, walked withoute the Church dore,
wayting for the Brides retourne.</p>
            <p>VVhile these things were in doing at Paris,
Strozzi, who as we haue said, had the charge of
the kings power at sea, houering vpon the coast
of Rochell, did now and then send of his cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
and souldiers into the towne, vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of buying things necessarie: and sometime
he came thither also him selfe. The like was
done at the same time in another part of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
by the horssemen of Gonzague Duke of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
nere to the towne of la Charité, whiche
hath a bridge ouer the riuer of Loyre, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
till that time in the power of those of
the Religion, by reason of the great number of
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there inhabiting. This troupe was of those
horssemen whiche the King hath accustomed
to keepe in ordinarie wages in euery countrey,
whereof the most parte were Italians, countrey
men to their Captaine Lewes Gonzague, to
whome the Queene mother had giuen the
daughter and heire of the Duke of Niuers in
mariage. They requested of the townesmen,
that they might make their musters within the
<pb n="XXXVIII" facs="tcp:4447:21"/>
towne, saying that they had receyued warrante
from the King so to do, and shewed the Kings
letters therefore. At Lions the gouernoure of
the towne, commaunded a view to be taken of
all those that professed the Religion, and their
names to be written in a boke and broughte
vnto him: which booke shortly after, according
to the successe, was called the bloudy booke.</p>
            <p>After the mariage ended at Paris, which was
the time that the Admirall had appointed to
returne to his owne house, he moued the king
concerning his departure. But so great was the
preparation of playes, so great was the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
of banquets and shewes, and the King
so earnestly bent to those matters, that he had
no leysure, not onely for waightie affaires, but
also not so much as to take his naturall sleepe.
For in the French court, Dauncings, Maskings
stageplayes (wherein the King exceedingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth)
are commonly vsed in the night time:
and so the time that is fittest for counsell and
matters of gouernance, is by reason of nightly
riottous sitting vp, of necessitie consumed in
sleepe. So great also is the familiaritie of men
and the wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Queene mothers traine,
and so great libertie of sporting, entertainment
and talking togither, as to forein nations maye
<pb n="XXXIX" facs="tcp:4447:21"/>
seeme incredible, and be thought of all honest
persons a matter not very conuenient for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of noble yong Ladies chastitie. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
if there come any pandor or bawde oute
of Italie, or any Scholemaster of shameful and
filthie lust, he winneth in short time maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
fauour and credit. And such a multitude
is there begonne to be of Italians, commonly
throughout all Fraunce, specially in the court,
since the administration of the realme was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Queene mother, that many doe
commonly call it Fraunce-Italian, and some
terme it a Colonie, and some a common sincke
of Italie.</p>
            <p>These madnesses of the Courte, were the
cause that the Admirall could not haue accese
to the Kings speache, nor entrance to deale in
waightie matters. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they that were sent
from the refourmed Churches to complayne
of iniuries commonlye done to those of the
Religion, vnderstode of the Admirals purpose
to departe, they did with all speede deliuer to
him their bookes and petitions, and besoughte
him, not to departe from the Court till he had
dealte in the cause of the Churches, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
their petitions to the King and his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell.
For this cause the Admirall resolued to
<pb n="Xl" facs="tcp:4447:22"/>
deferre his goyng for a while, till he mighte
treat with the kings Counsell concerning those
requests: for the King had promised him that
he would shortly entend those matters, and be
present with the Counsell himselfe.</p>
            <p>Besides this delay, there was another mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that stayed him. There was owing to the
Rutters of Germanie, whiche had serued on
the part of the Religion in the last warre, great
summes of money for their wages, in whiche
matter the Admirall trauelled with incredible
earnestnesse and care.</p>
            <p>Concerning all these affaires, the Admirall
(as he determined before) hauing accesse and
opportunitie for that purpose, moued the
Kings priuie Counsell the .22. daye of August,
which was the fift daye after the king of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarres
mariage, and spent muche time in that
treatie. Aboute noone, when he was in retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
home from the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell, with a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
of noblemen and gentlemen, beholde, a
Harquebuzier oute of a windowe of a house
neere adioyning, shotte the Admirall with two
bullets of leade through both the armes. VVhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the Admirall felt himselfe wounded, nothing
at all amazed, but with the same countenance
that he was accustomed, he said, through yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="XlI" facs="tcp:4447:22"/>
windowe it was done: go see who are in
the house. VVhat manner of trecherie is this?
The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he sent a certayne gentleman of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
to the king to declare it vnto him. The
king at that time was playing at Tennise wyth
the Duke of Guise Assoone as he heard of the
Admirals hurte, he was maruellously moued as
it seemed, and threw away his racket that hee
played with on the grounde, and taking with
him his brother in lawe the king of Nauarre,
he retired into his castle.</p>
            <p>The gentlemen that were with the Admiral
brake into the house from whence he recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
his hurte, there they found only one wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
the keper of the house, and shortly after
also a boy, his lackey that had done the deede,
and therewithall they founde the harquebuze
lying vppon the table in that chamber from
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the noyse was heard: him that shot they
found not, for he in great hast was runne away
out at the backe gate, and getting on horsse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe,
which he had wayting for him redy sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
at the dore, he rode a great pace to Sainte
Anthonies gate, where he had a freshe horsse
tarying for him if neede were, and another at
Marcelles gate. Then by the kings commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
a great number rode out in post into all
<pb n="XlII" facs="tcp:4447:23"/>
partes to pursue him: but for that he was slipped
into bywayes, and receiued into a certaine ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
they could not ouertake him.</p>
            <p>At the sure of the king of Nauarre, and the
Prince of Conde and other, the King by and
by gaue commission for enquirie to be made
of the matter, and committed the examining
thereof to three chosen persons of the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Paris, Thuan and Morsant and Viol a
counseller.</p>
            <p>Firste it was found that the same house be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to a Priest a Canon of saint Germaine,
whose name is Villemure, which had bene the
Duke of Guises scholemaster in his youthe,
and still continued a retayner towarde hym.
Then the woman whiche we said was founde
in the house, being taken and broughte before
them, confessed that a fewe dayes before, there
came to hir one Chally sometime a maister
d'hostel of the Duke of Guises house, and now
of the Kings courte, and commaunded hir to
make muche of the man that had done thys
deede, and to lodge him in the same bed and
chamber where Villemure was wont to lie, for
that he was his friende and very familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
and that Villemure would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
glad of it. The name of him that shot was
<pb n="XlIII" facs="tcp:4447:23"/>
very dilligently kepte secret. Some say it was
Manreuet, whiche in the thirde ciuill warre
traiterously slew his captaine monsieur de Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy,
a most valiante and noble gentleman, and
straightway fled into the enimies campe. Some
saye it was Bondot, one of the archers of the
Kings guarde. VVhen the womans confession
was broughte to the king, he immediatly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Monsieur de Nance, captaine of his guard,
and commaunded him to apprehend Challey
and bring him to him. Challey assoone as hee
heard the stroke of the peece, fledde into the
Kings castle called the Louure, and hid him in
the Duke of Guises chamber, from whence
he conuayed him selfe away assoone as he had
heard of the kings commaundement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> VVhen
de Nance was infourmed of his departure, he
answered that Challey was a gentleman of
good worship, and there was no doubte but
when neede were he woulde appeare before
the King and the magistrates.</p>
            <p>VVhile these things were doyng, and the
Admirals wound in dressing, Theligny went
by his commaundement to the King, and most
humbly besought him in the name of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in lawe, that his maiestie woulde voutsafe
to come vnto him, for that his life seemed to be
<pb n="XlIIII" facs="tcp:4447:24"/>
in perill, and that he had certaine things to say,
greatly importing to the King; safetie, whiche
he well knewe that none in his Realme durst
declare to his maiestie. The King curteously
aunswered that he would willingly go to him,
and within a little while after he set forwarde.
The Queene mother went with him, and the
Duke of Aniow, the Duke of Monpensier, a
most affectionate subiect to the Churche of
Rome, the Counte de Rhetz, the Queene mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
great familiar, Chauigny and Entragny,
which afterwarde were chiefe ringleaders in
the butcherie of Paris.</p>
            <p>VVhen the King had louingly saluted the
Admirall as he was wont to do, and had gently
asked him some questions co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning his hurt
and the state of his health, and the Admirall
had aunswered with suche a milde and quiet
countenaunce, that all they that were present
wondered at his temperance and pacience, the
king beyng much moued (as it seemed) sayd,
The hurt my Admirall is done to thee, but the
dishonour to me: but by the death of God
(saith he) I sweare I will so seuerely reuenge
both the hurte and the dishonor, that it shall
neuer be forgotten. He asked him also how he
lik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d of the Iudges that he had chosen, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="XlV" facs="tcp:4447:24"/>
he had giuen commission for examining the
matter. The Admiral aunswered that he could
not but very well like of those that his maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
had allowed of, yet he besought him if he
thought it good, that Cauagnes might be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to counsell with them, albeit that it was no
hard matter to finde out, for it was no doubt
(sayd he) that this good turne was done him
by the Duke of Guise, the reuenge wherof he
referred to God. This onely he most heartily
and humbly besoughte of his royall maiestie,
that the fact might be duelie enquired vpon.
The King aunswered that he would take ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
care of it, and reuenge that iniurie with no
lesse seueritie than if it had bene done to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
Then the kings brethren and their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with drawing themselues a while, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall
as it was afterward knowne by his owne
report, began to aduise the king to haue in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie
those things that he had ofte tolde him
of the daungerous intentions of certaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
and he tolde him, that though he himself
had receiued a great wound, yet there was no
lesse hanging ouer the kings head: and that
long ago there was treaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in practizing against
his life, which if he would do wisely he should
auoyde betimes. Further he sayd, that though
<pb n="XlVI" facs="tcp:4447:25"/>
so soone as God should take him to himselfe
out of this life, he doubted not but that his
same should be brought into sundry slaunders
by enuious persons, and such as ought him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
will by reason of the late warres, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
he had oftentimes disclosed vnto the king
the authors of the dissentions, and opened the
causes therof, and that God was his witnesse of
his most faithfull hearte to the king and the
common weale, and that he had neuer holden
any thing dearer than his countrey and the
publique safetie.</p>
            <p>The king after such aunswere made here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
as he thought best, spake aloude, &amp; hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
entreated the Admirall to suffer himself to
be remoued into his castell of the Louure, for
that he thought some perill, least there should
arise some sedition among the commons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
in disorder, or any stirre in that madde
and troublesome Citie VVherto this speech of
the king tended coulde not then be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode.
For though the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monaltie of Paris
hath euer bene accompted the most foolish &amp;
madde of all other, yet is it euer most easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased,
not onely with the comming and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the king, but also with the very sound
of his name. The Admirall most humbly and
<pb n="XlVII" facs="tcp:4447:25"/>
largely thanked the king, and made his exuse
vpon the counsell of the Phisitions, which fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that shaking would encrease his paine, and
therfore had taken order that he should not
be stirred out of his place. Then the Counte
de Rhetz turning to certaine gentlemen of
the Admirals friends, sayd, I would the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
would follow the kings counsell; for it is to
be feared that some such stirre may arise in the
towne, as the king shall not easily be able to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease.
VVhich speech being vttered, although
no man did yet suspect whereto that aduise
tended, yet the Admirall &amp; his friends thought
it good to request of the king to assigne vnto
him certaine of the souldiers of the guarde for
his safetie. The king aunswered that he verie
well liked of that deuise, and that he was fully
determined to prouide aswell for the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
safetie as for his owne, and that he would
preserue the Admirall as the ball of his eye, &amp;
that he had in admiration the constancie and
fortitude of the man, and that he neuer before
that time beleued that there could be so great
valiauntnesse of courage in anye mortall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>Therewith the Duke of Aniow the Kings
brother commaunded Cossin captaine of the
<pb n="XlVIII" facs="tcp:4447:26"/>
Kings guarde, to place a certaine band of soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to ward before the Admirals gate. There
could hardly a man be found more hatefull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Admirals parte, nor more affected to
the Guisians tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this Cossin, which the successe
plainly proued, as hereafter shall appeare. The
Duke of Aniow further added, that he thought
it should be good for the Admirall, if moe of
his frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds and familiars that lodged in the faux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burges
did drawe nearer about him: and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he commaunded the kings herbingers to
warne those to whome they had before assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
lodgings in that streete, to remoue from
thence, and to place the Admirals friendes in
their roomes. VVhiche counsell was suche, as
none coulde possibly be deuised more fit for
those things that followed. For those whiche
might haue by flight escaped out of the suburbs
were nowe holden fast inough, being enclosed
not only within the walles of the towne, but
also within the compasse of one narrow strete.
The nexte day after, the Vndermasters of the
streetes commonly called Quartermen, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed
al the vittailing houses and Innes from
house to house, and all the names of those of
the Religion, together with the place of euery
of their lodgings they put in bookes, and with
<pb n="XlIX" facs="tcp:4447:26"/>
speede deliuered ouer the same bookes to
those of whome they had receyued that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement.</p>
            <p>After noone the Queene mother lead out
the King, the Duke of Aniow, Gonzague,
Tauaignes, the Countie de Rhetz called Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din,
into hir gardens called Tegliers. This place
bicause it was somewhat farre from resort, she
thoughte most fit for this their last consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
There she shewede them, how those whom
they had long bene in waite for, were nowe
sure in hold, and the Admirall lay in his bed
maymed of hoth his armes and coulde not
stirre, the king of Nauarre and Prince of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
were fast lodged in the castle, the gates wer
kept shut all nighte, and watches placed, so as
they were so snared that they coulde no way
escape, and the captaines thus taken, it was not
to be feared that any of the Religion woulde
from thencefoorth stirre any more. Now was
a notable opportunite (said she) offred to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
the matter. For all the chiefe captaines
were fast closed vp in Paris, and the rest in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
townes were all vnarmed and vnprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and that there were scarcely to be founde
ten enimies to a thousand Catholikes: that the
Parisians were in armour and were able to
<pb n="l" facs="tcp:4447:27"/>
make threescore thousande chosen fighting
men, and that within the space of one houre
all the enimies may be slayne, and the whole
name and race of those wicked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be vtterly
rooted out. On the other side (saith she) if the
King do not take the aduantage of the fitnesse
of this time, it is no doubte but that if the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall
recouer his health, al Fraunce wil short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be on fire with the fourth ciuill warre.</p>
            <p>The Queenes opinion was allowed. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
it was thought best, partly for his age, and
partly for the affinities sake, that the king of
Nauarres life shuld be saued. As for the Prince
of Conde, it was doubted whether it were best
to spare hym for his age, or to put him to
death for hatred of his fathers name. But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the opinion of Gonzague toke place, that
he should with feare of death and torment, be
drawen from the Religion. So that counsell
brake vp, with appoyntment that the matter
should be put in executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the nexte night ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
afore day, and that the ordering and doing
of all shoulde be committed to the Duke of
Guise.</p>
            <p>The Admirall being en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ormed of stirre and
noyse of armour, and threatnings heard euery
where through out the towne, and preparation
<pb n="lI" facs="tcp:4447:27"/>
of many things pertaining to tumult, sent word
therof to the King: who aunswered, that there
was no cause for the Admirall to feare, for all
was done by his commaundement, and not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
where, but in certaine places, &amp; that there
were certaine appointed by him to be in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,
least the people should rise and make any
stirre in the towne.</p>
            <p>VVhen the Duke of Guise thoughte all
things readie enough, he called to him the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouesayde
Marcell, and charged him that he
should a little after midnight assemble togither
the maisters of the streetes whome they call
Diziners into the towne house, for he had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
strange and speciall matters in charge fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the king, which his pleasure was to haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto them. They all assembled bytime.
Carron the new prouost of merchaunts, guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with certaine Guisians, and among the rest
Entragne and Pnygallart, made the declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
He sayd that the kings meaning was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroye
all the Rebels which had in these late
yeares borne armes against his maiestie, and to
roote out the race of those wicked men, it was
now very fitly happened that the chieftaynes
and ringleaders of them were faste enclosed
within the walles of the towne, as in a prison,
<pb n="lII" facs="tcp:4447:28"/>
and that the same night they should first begin
with them, and afterward for the rest assone as
possibly might be, throughout all partes of the
Realme the King would take order: and the
token to set vpon them, should be giuen, not
with a trumpet, but with tocksein or ringing of
the great bell of the pallace, which they knewe
to be accustomed onely in great cases: and the
marke for them to be knowne from other,
should be a white linnen cloth hanged aboute
their left arme, and a white crosse pinned vpon
their cappes. In the meane time the Duke of
Guise made priuie thervnto the Captaines of
the Kings guarde, both Gascoignes, Frenchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and Switzers, and bad them be readie to goe to
it with good courage. Shortly after, the Duke
of Guise and the bastard sonne of king Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
commonlye called the Cheualier, with a
great band of armed men following the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, went
to the Admirals house, which Cossin kept be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged
with harquebuziers placed in order on
both sides of the streate.</p>
            <p>The Admiral aduertised of the stirre and the
noise of the armour, although he had scarcely
ten persons in his house able to beare harnesse,
and in his chamber onely two surgions, one
preacher and one or two seruitors, yet coulde
<pb n="lIII" facs="tcp:4447:28"/>
not be made afraide, trusting (as he oft rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed)
vpon the Kings good will toward him, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
by so many and so great meanes of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suraunce,
hauing also confidence that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monaltie
of Paris if they once vnderstode the
King to mislike of their madde furie, howe
much so euer they were in outrage, yet so sone
as they saw Cossin warding the gate, they wold
be appeased. He repeated also the other for kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of the peace, so ofte openly sworne by the
King and his brethren and their mother, and
entred in publike recordes, the league lately
made with the Queene of Englande for the
same cause, the articles of treatie couenanted
with the Prince of Aurenge, the kings faith gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to the Princes of Germanie, some townes
attempted and some taken in the lowe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
by the Kings commaundement, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of the Kings sister solemnized but sixe
daies before, which it was not like that he wold
suffer to be defiled with bloud, finally the iuge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of forain nations and of posteritie, shame
and the honor &amp; constancie of a Prince, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
faith, and the sacred respect of the law of
nations, all which it seemed monstruous and
incredible that the king could assent to be stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with so outragious a cruell deede.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="lIIII" facs="tcp:4447:29"/>Cossin when he sawe the noblemen drawe
neere, knocked at the gate, which as is aboue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
he was commaunded by the Duke of
Aniow to kepe. VVhervpon many applyed the
olde prouerbe, A goodly guarde to make the
woolfe keper of the sheepe. VVhen he was
entred without in maner any difficultie, he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in with him a great companie of armed
men, and after those followed the great Lords.
Such as Cossin found at the entrie of &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the porch of the house, he slew with a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san
that he had in his hand. VVhich when the
Admirall vnderstoode, he caused those that
were about him to lift him out of his bed, and
casting on a nightgowne vpon him, he rose vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
on his feete, he bad his friends and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes
to flee and make shift for them selues,
and to take no more care for him, for he sayd
that he was readie with most willing hearte to
render into the hands of God, now calling for
it againe, the spirit that he had lent him to vse
for a time: and sayd that this violent crueltie
was prepared not so much for his destruction,
as for the dishonoring of Christ and the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
of so many Churches, the defence of
which Churches he had at the potition of all
godly men with his many daungers and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
<pb n="lV" facs="tcp:4447:29"/>
sustained.</p>
            <p>In the meane time there came vp the staires
into the hier part of the house, one Benuese a
Germayne, broughte vp in the house of the
Duke of Guise, and to whome it is saide, that
the Cardinall of Loraine had giuen one of his
bastard daughters in mariage: and with hym
came Cossin the Gascoine, Attin a Picarde a
retainer and familiar of the Duke d'Aumal,
one that a few yeares before sought to murder
d'Andelot by treason, and also one Ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort an
Auernois, all weaponed with swords and tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets,
and armed with shirts of maile.</p>
            <p>VVhen they were broken into the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
chamber, Benuese came to him, and ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his drawen sword vpon him, said, Art not
thou the Admirall? he with a quiet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
countenance, (as we haue since vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stode
by them selues) answered, I am so called.
And then seeing the sword drawen vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him,
he sayde, yong man, consider my age and the
weake case that I am now in. But the fellowe,
after blaspheming God, first thrust his sworde
into the Admirals brest, and then also stroke
him vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the head, and Attin shot him through
the brest with a pistol. VVhen the Admirall
was with this wound not yet throughly dead,
<pb n="lVI" facs="tcp:4447:30"/>
Benuese gaue him the third wound vpon the
thigh, and so he fell downe for dead. VVhen
the Duke of Guise, which stayed in the court
with the other noble men, heard this, he cried
out alowde, hast thou done Benuese? he aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
I haue done. Then said the Duke of
Guise, our Cheuelier (meaning King Henries
bastard abouesaide) vnlesse he see it with hys
eyes, will not beleeue it: throwe him downe at
the windowe. Then Benuese with the helpe
of his fellowes toke vp the Admirals body and
threw it downe through the windowe. VVhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
by reason of the wounde in his head, and hys
face couered with bloud they could not well
discerne him, the Duke of Guise kneeled
downe on the grounde and wiped him with a
napkin and said, now I know him, it is he. And
therewithal going out at the gate with the rest
of the Lords, he cryed out to the multitude in
armoure, saying: my companions we haue had
a good lucky beginning: nowe let vs go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to the rest, for it is the Kings commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement:
which words he did ofte repete a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowde,
saying, Thus the King commaundeth:
This is the Kings will, this is his pleasure. And
then he commaunded the token to be giuen
by ringing tocksein with the great bell of the
<pb n="lVII" facs="tcp:4447:30"/>
palace, and alarme to be raysed, and he caused
it to be published, that the conspiratours were
in armoure and about to kill the king. Then a
certaine Italian of Go<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>zagues band, cut off the
Admirals head, and sent it preserued with spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to Rome to the Pope and the Cardinall of
Loraine. Other cut off his hands, and other his
secret partes. Then the common labourers and
rascals three dayes togither dragged the dead
body thus mangled and berayed with bloud
and filth, through the streetes, and afterwarde
drew it out of the towne to the common gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
and hanged it vp with a rope by the
feete.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, those of the noble mens
bandes brake into all the chambers of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals
house, and suche as they founde eyther
in theyr beds, or hidden, they mangled them
with many wounds, and so slaughtered them.
Of that number were two young children,
pages, of honourable birth. There was also
the Counte Rochfoucault, which for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
plesantnesse of his wit, and for his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantnesse
was hiely beloued of King Henry,
and so seemed for the same cause also to be
beloued of the king. Him was de Na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce aboue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
commaunded to kill, but he refusing it for
<pb n="lVIII" facs="tcp:4447:31"/>
their old acquaintance and familiaritie: one La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge
an Auernois offred him self to the king
to do it, but with this condition, that the king
should giue him the captaineship of horssemen
which Counte Rochfoucault had. There was
also slayne Theligny the Admirals so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne in law,
a yong man of singular towardnesse bothe of
wit and courage, to whome the king these ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
yeares had both in words and countenance
made shewe of so great good will, as that no
man was thoughte to be more hiely in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure.
He crying out, that it was now grieuous
to him to liue, for that he had euer commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to his father in lawe the faithfulnesse of
the King, refused not the deathe offred hym.
And many other most flourishing yong noble
men and gentlemen were euery where but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherly
murthered in that streete. Then the
noble mens bands, and Cossins souldiers went
ransacking from house to house: and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals
house and all the other houses were all
sacked and spoyled, euen in like manner as is
vsed to be done by souldiers greedy of pray in
a towne take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by assault: and many by this rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berie,
were of beggers sodeinly become riche
men. For the Duke of Guise, the Duke of
Monpensier, the Cheualier king Henries ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starde,
<pb n="lIX" facs="tcp:4447:31"/>
Gonzague, Tauaignes, and the other
great Lords, did with reward of the spoile and
bootie encourage the multitude to the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and cried out aloud that this was the kings
will. So all the rest of the day from morning to
euening, the rascall multitude, encouraged by
spoyle and robberie, ranne with their bloudy
swords raging throughout all the towne: they
spared not the aged, nor women, nor the very
babes: In ioy and triumph they threw the slaine
bodies out at the windowes, so as there was
not in manner any one streete or lane, that
seemed not strawed with murthered carcases.</p>
            <p>VVhile these things were thus a doing in
the towne, the King of Nauarre and the prince
of Conde, whome the King had lodged in hys
owne castle of the Louure, were by the kings
commaundement sent for and conueyed vnto
him. But their company, their seruitours of
their chamber, their friends reteining to them,
their scholemaisters, and those that had the
bringing vp of them, crying out alowde to the
Kings fidelitie for succoure, were thrust out of
the chambers, and by the kings guard of Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers
hewed in pieces and slaughtered in the
kings owne sight. But of that number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
slayne, no mans case was so much lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="lX" facs="tcp:4447:32"/>
of many, as Monsieur de Pilles, in whome
it is hard to expresse whether there were more
godly zeale in Religion, or prowesse in warre.
VVhereby hauing in the late yeares, specially
by the defence of the towne of Saint Iohn
d'Angeli, which the King then besieged, gotten
great honoure of cheualrie, he was thoughte
very well beloued and hiely esteemed of the
King. Him and Leranne the sonne of Odou,
by the French Kings commaundement (which
was not then vnderstoode whereto it tended)
the King of Nauarre had stayed in a wardrobe
adioyning to his owne chamber, and caused
them to lodge there al night. A little afore day,
hearing of the running of men, and noyse of
armor, and cries and killings, they rose in hast,
and immediatly de Nance, whome we haue
before spoken of, came to them, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them in the kings name to come downe
into the court, and to leaue their weapons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
them, and lastly to depart out of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle.
VVhen de Pilles sawe himselfe thrust out
among the multitude of the murthering soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and beheld the bodies of them that were
slayne, he cried out with a very lowde voyce
that the king might well heare him, protesting
vpon the kings fidelitie, and detesting his tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
<pb n="lXI" facs="tcp:4447:32"/>
infidelitie, &amp; therwith he toke off a rich
cloake whiche he wore, and gaue it to one of
his acquainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, saying, take here this token of
Pilles, and hereafter remember Pilles moste
vnworthyly and shamefully slayne. Oh my
good Monsieur de Pilles, saide the other, I am
none of them: I thanke you for your cloake,
but I will not receiue it with that condition,
and so refused to take the cloake: and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
de Pilles was thrust through by one of
the guarde with a partisan, and died. And this
ende had this most valiante and noble gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
And then his body was throwen into the
quarrey with the rest, whiche when they that
passed by did behold, the souldiers cryed out,
there they be that made assault vpon vs, and
would haue killed the King. Leranne beeing
thrust through with a sword, escaped and ran
into the Queene of Nauarres chamber, and
was by hir kept and preserued from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of those that pursued him. Shortly after,
she obtayned his pardon of hir brother, and
committing him to hir owne Phisitions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
him both to life and health.</p>
            <p>VVhile things were in doing at Paris, Stroz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zi,
which (as we haue aforesayd) was come with
all his power to Rochell, sent a great number of
<pb n="lXII" facs="tcp:4447:33"/>
his souldiers into the towne, vnder colour of a
banket to be made to his friends in the castell
called la Cheine, but by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the iealosie &amp;
watches of the townes men, by whom he sawe
his treason was espied, he went away without
his purpose. But they of la Charité, which as
we haue before shewed, were trapped by the
Italian horssemen, taking lesse heed to the safe
keeping of their towne, were a little before
night surprized, and within fewe dayes after
put to the sweard.</p>
            <p>The next day following, where any that had
hidden themselues in corners at Paris coulde
be found out, the slaughter was renewed: also
common labourers and porters, and other of
the most rascals of the people and desperate
villaines, to haue the spoile of their clothes,
stripped the dead bodies starke naked &amp; threw
them into the riuer of Seane. The profit of all
the robberies and spoyles came all for the most
part to the handes of these laborers and the
souldiers, and to the Kings treasure came very
little or nothing. The onely gaine that came to
him, was that which might be made of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
(as they terme them) of offices and of
places of Magistrates, Captaines &amp; other romes
of charge, wherof yet he gaue a great part free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="lXIII" facs="tcp:4447:33"/>
away to diuers of the Court. For the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
office he gaue to the Marques de Villars,
the Chancellorship of Nauarre, after the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Francourt, he by and by gaue to Henry
Memne de Malassise, which had been the
truchman and messenger in the treatie of the
last peace: the office of the maister of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
after the slaughter of Prunes he gaue
to Villequier, the office of President des aides
when Plateau was slaine he gaue to de Nully:
the other offices he sold as his maner is, to such
as gaue ready money for them. For it hath ben
the custome now lately of certaine Kings of
Fraunce (such as among forein nations hath
not bene heard of) to put to sale all the profits,
rights, and benefites of the crowne, and to kepe
an open market for money, of all iudiciall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
and of all the roomes belonging to his
treasure and finances, according to a rate of
price set vpon euerie one of them: and there is
not in maner one in all Fraunce, that doth not
ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly iustifie that he bought his office for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
money, and that no man ought to maruell
if he desire to fill vp the empty hole of his stock
againe. And therefore iustice is throughe all
Fraunce vsually bought for money, &amp; though
there be neuer so many murders committed,
<pb n="lXIIII" facs="tcp:4447:34"/>
yet is there no processe awarded to enquire
thereof, till present coyne be payde to the rake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helles
and scribes.</p>
            <p>This butcherly slaughter of Paris thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed,
and foure hundred houses (as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouesayd)
sacked, immediatly messengers were
sent in post into all partes of the Realme, with
ofte shifting their horsses for hast, to command
all other Cities in the Kings name to follow the
example of Paris, and to cause to be killed as
many as they had among them of the refour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Religion.</p>
            <p>These commaundments it is wonderfull to
tell how readily and cherefully the greatest part
of the Cities of Fraunce did obey and execute.
But the king, fearing (as it was likely) the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
of false treacherie and periurie, sent let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to the gouernours of his prouinces, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
speedie messangers into England, Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
and Switzerland, to declare in his name,
that there was a great commotion and sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
stirre happened at Paris, which he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sorie for: that the Duke of Guise had raised
the people, and with armed men made assaulte
vpon the band that was assigned to the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
for his guarde, and had broken into the
house and slaine the Admirall and all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
<pb n="lXV" facs="tcp:4447:34"/>
and houshold seruants, and that the king
had hardly kept safe from those daungers hys
owne castell of the Louure, where he kept him
selfe close with his mother and his brethren:
the true copie of which letters is hereafter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted.
But the same most mightie, and by the
consent of all nations commonlye called the
most Christian King, within two dayes after
came into the Parliament accompanied with a
great traine of his brethren and other Princes.
The counsell being assembled, he sitting in his
throne, began to speake vnto them, he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that he was certified; that the Admiral with
certaine of his complices had conspired hys
death, and had intended the like purpose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his brethren, the Queene his mother, &amp;
the king of Nauarre, and that for this cause he
had commaunded his friends to slay the sayde
Admiral and all his confederates, and so to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
the treason of his enimies.</p>
            <p>This his testification and declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the king
commaunded to be written and entred in the
recordes of Parliament, and that it should be
proclamed by the heraldes, and published by
Printers. And he willed a boke to be set forth to
this effect, that the slaughter of the Admirall &amp;
his adherentes was done by the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement,
<pb n="lXVI" facs="tcp:4447:35"/>
for so was his maiesties expresse
pleasure, bicause they had conspired to kill him
and his brethren, and the Queene his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the King of Nauarre. And farther,
that the King did forbid that from thenceforth
there should be no moe assemblies holden, nor
preachings vsed of the Religion.</p>
            <p>After the kings oration ended, Christopher
Thuane President of that Parliament, a man
verie notable for his lighte brayne and his
cruell heart, did with very large words congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate
vnto the king, that he had nowe with
guile and subtiltie ouercome these his enimies,
whom he could neuer vanquishe by armes and
battell, saying that therein the King had most
fully verified the olde saying of Lewes the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth
his progenitor King of France, which
was wont to say that he knew neuer a Latine
sentence but this one, <hi>Qui nescit dissimulare
nescit regnare,</hi> He that can not skill to dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
can not skill to be a king. But Pibrace, the
aduocate of the Finances, made a short oration,
the summe wherof was to this effect, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the king had iust and great cause to be
displeased, yet he thoughte it more agreable
with his maiesties clemencie and goodnesse, to
make an ende of the slaughters and common
<pb n="lXVII" facs="tcp:4447:35"/>
spoyle, and not to suffer suche outrages to be
any longer committed without iudiciall proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in the cause: and besoughte his maiestie
that from thenceforth it woulde please him to
vse the lawe, which is well knowne to be the
onely stablishment of kingdomes and empires:
and that there had bene alreadie giuen to the
commonaltie too perilous an example to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe.
An arrest of Parliament with the Kings
royall assent being made to that effecte, there
were immediately Haroldes and trumpeter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
sent round about all the towne, and an Edict
proclaimed in the kings name, that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
the slaughters &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon butcherly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therings
shuld ceasse, and that all persons shuld
abstaine from pillage and robberie.</p>
            <p>This being knowne, there were diuers spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
vsed of this matter throughout the town,
and specially of learned men. The most parte
sayd, that they had read many histories, but in
all memorie of all ages they neuer heard of any
suche thing as this. They compared this case
with the horrible doings of king Mithridates,
which with one messenger and with the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement
of one letter, caused a hundreth and
fiftie thousand Romaines to be slaine. Some
compared it with the doing of Peter of Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone,
<pb n="lXVIII" facs="tcp:4447:36"/>
which slewe eight thousand Frenchmen
in Sicile, which Isle they had surprised in his
absence. But yet this difference appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene
those cases and this: that those Kings
had exercised their crueltie vpon foreins and
strangers: but this king had done his outrage
vpon his owne subiectes, being yelded not so
much to his power, as to his fayth and credit.
Those kings were bounde by no promise but
such as was giuen to the strangers themselues:
this king was with newe made league bounde
to the Kings and Princes his neighbours to
kepe the peace that he had sworn. Those kings
vsed no guilefull meanes vnworthie for the
maiestie of a king, to deceiue: this king for a
baite and allurement abused the mariage of his
owne sister, and in a manner besprinkled hir
wedding robe with blood. VVhich dishonor &amp;
indignitie no posteritie of all ages can forget.
Some againe discoursed, that though this cruell
aduise semed to many Courtiers to haue bene
profitable, yet not onely the honor of a King,
but also the estimation and good same of the
whole nation was against that shewe of profit.
They alleaged how Aristides did openly in the
audience of all the people, reiect the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell of
Themistocles co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the burning of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
<pb n="lXIX" facs="tcp:4447:36"/>
nauie, although it must nedes haue
followed, that the power of the Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
their enimies should therby haue bene vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
weakened. Furius Camillus receiued not
the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the chiefe Lords of the Phalisce,
betrayed to him by their schoolemaster, but
stripped him naked and deliuered him to be
whipped home with rods by the same childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Pausanias hath lefte it reported that the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie
of Philip of Macedon fell into moste
greate calamities, for this cause, that he was
wont to set light by the reuerend conscience
of an oth and his faith giuen in leagues. Some
cited the lawe of the twelue tables: <hi>Si patronu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
clienti fraudem facit, facer est<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> If the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone
or soueraigne defraude his client or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssal,
be he out of protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They disputed also,
that like faith as the vassall oweth to his Lord,
the Lord oweth also to his vassall: and for what
causes and for what fellonies the vassal loseth
his tenancie, for the same causes and fellonies
the Lord loseth his segniorie. Some saide that
the right hand in auncient time was called the
pledge of the faith of a king, and that this if a
king shall despise, there is no communion of
right with him, and he is no more to be accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a king, neither of his owne subiects nor of
<pb n="lXX" facs="tcp:4447:37"/>
straungers. Kingly vertues in times past haue
bene reported to be these, iustice, gentlenesse
and clemencie: but crueltie and outrage haue
euer bene dispraised both in all persons and
spec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ally in princes. Scipio hath in all ages bene
praysed, who was wont to say, that he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
saue one citizen than kill a thousand eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
whiche sentence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Antoninus the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
surnamed Pius the kind or vertuous, did
ofte repete. It was a most shamefull by worde
of yong Tiberius to be called Clay tempered
with bloud. They said also, that kings haue po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of life and death ouer their subiects, but
not without hering the cause, and iudicial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding:
that there cannot be alleaged a greater
authoritie, than the dictators had at Rome, in
whome was the soueraigne power of peace
and warre, of life and death, and without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale,
yet was it not lawfull for them to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
a citizen his cause vnheard. Only theeues
and murderers take away mens liues withoute
order of lawe and hearing their cause. VVho
can doubt (said they) but that this so great out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e,
so great sheading of Christian bloud is
the frute of the curssed life of the courtiers?
For (saide they) nowe throughout all Fraunce
whoredome and loose leudnesse of life are so
<pb n="lXXI" facs="tcp:4447:37"/>
free and vsuall, that nowe the most part of the
women of Fraunce seeme to be in manner
common: and the wicked blasphemies and
continuall execrations and dishonorings of
Gods most holy name and maiestie, are suche
as God cannot longer beare: and true it is,
though incredible among foreine Nations,
that the catholikes of Fraunce haue prescribed
them selues this for a speciall marke to bee
knowne from other men, that at euery thirde
word they blasphemously sweare by the head,
death, bloud, and bellie of God: and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
it is, that the King him selfe is so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
in this custome of swearing and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming:
and this as it were a pestilente infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is spred abrode and common among the
very plowmen and paysants, so as none among
them now speaketh three words without most
filthy blaspheming and horrible execration of
God. VVho can longer beare the vile vncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stities,
the bawdes and ruffians of the Courte?
Finally, very nature it selfe doth now as it wer
expostulate with God for his so long suffera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
and forbearing, and the very earth can no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
beare these monsters.</p>
            <p>Nowe as touching the Admirals supposed
conspiracie, who can thinke it likely that hee
<pb n="lXXII" facs="tcp:4447:38"/>
shoulde enterprise any suche thing within the
walles of Paris? For in the Court there is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
watching and warding a garrison of
the kings: and at the entrie of his castell the
guardes of Gascoines, Scottes and Switzers,
are continually attending: &amp; the king hymselfe
both alwayes before, and specially at that time,
by reason of his sisters marriage, had a great
trayne of Princes, great Lords, noblemen and
gentlemen about him. Moreouer it was well
knowne, that in Paris within three hours space
might be assembled and put in armoure three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
thousand chosen armed men, specially
against the Admiral, whom no man is ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
that the Parisians most deadly hated: beside
that, the noble yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g men that came thither with
the king of Nauarre and the Prince of Conde
by reason of the mariage, and brought wyth
them their wiues, their sisters and their kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women,
thoughte at that time vpon nothing
but vpon triumph and exercises of pastime, &amp;
gaye furniture of apparell and ornamentes.
Finally, at whither of these two times can it be
likely that the Admirall attempted this conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie?
was it before he was hurt? why? at that
time he found the king his most louing, or at
leaste his moste liberall and bountifull good
<pb n="lXXIII" facs="tcp:4447:38"/>
Lord: neither coulde he hope euer to haue a
more fauourable soueraigne in France. VVas
it then after he was hurt? as though forsothe
helying sore of two so great woundes, aged,
maimed of both his armes, the one wherof the
Phiſitions consulted whether it were to be cut
off, accompanied with three hundreth yong
men, would set vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> threscore thousand armed
men, or in so small a time could lay the plot for
so great, and so long and so heynous a fact: for
he liued scarce fortie houres after his hurte, in
which time he was enioyned by the Phisitions
to forbeare talke. Againe, if he had bene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
of any such crime, was he not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Cossin and to his keping, and so enuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
all the wayes beset about him, and so in
the kings power, that if it had pleased the king
he might at all times in a moment be caried to
prison? why was not orderly enquir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall
proceeding vsed according to the cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
and lawes and generall right of nations,
and witnesses produced according to the form
of lawe? but be it that the Admirall and a fewe
other of his confederats and followers had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired,
why yet proceded the outragious cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
vpon the rest that were innocent, why vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ancient matrones, why vpon noble Ladies
<pb n="lXXIIII" facs="tcp:4447:39"/>
and yong gentlewomen and virgins that came
thither for the honor of the wedding? why
were so many women greate with childe; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the lawes of al natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and of nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their deliuery throwen into the riuer? why
were so many aged persons, manye that lay
sicke in their beds, many gownemen, manye
counsellers, aduocates, proctors, Phisitions,
many singularly learned professors and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
of good artes, and among the reste Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus
Ramus that renoumed man throughout
the world, many yong students, executed with
out hearing, withoute pleading their cause,
without sentence of condemnation? moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
if the Admirall had slaine the three bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
who doubteth but that all countreyes, al
Cities, all Parliaments, finally, all sortes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of men would haue spedily taken armor
and easily haue destroyed all of the Religion,
hauing them enclosed within their townes, &amp;
hauing iust cause to render to al forrein nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for their common slaughters and killing of
them? As to that which toucheth the king of
Nauarre, what can be imagined more absurde
and vnlikely? had not the Admirall him foure
yeares in his power. Did not he professe the
same Religion that the Admirall did? which
<pb n="lXXV" facs="tcp:4447:39"/>
of those of the Religion, which of them I say
(as Cassius was wont to reason) shoulde haue
gained or receiued profit by the killing of the
king of Nauarre? did not the Catholikes hate
him? and the Admirall coulde not hope to
haue any man more friendly to him, nor by
any other mans meanes to haue reuenge of
his iniurie. Lastlye, in their houses that were
slaine, what armour, what weapons were fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
by which coniectures iudges vse to be lead to
trace oute a facte? These matters wise men
throughout the towne of Paris commonlye
muttered.</p>
            <p>But now to retourne to our purpose. At such
time as the Kings prohibition abouesaide was
proclaimed at Paris, not only in other townes,
as at Orleaunce, Angiers, Viaron, Troys, and
Auxe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e, the like butcheries and slaughters
were vsed, but also in the towne of Paris it
selfe, in the very gaoles that are ordeined for
the keeping of prisoners, if any had escaped
the crueltie of the day before, they were nowe
tumultuously slayne by the raging and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
multitude, in which number were three
Gentlemen of great reputation, captaine Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nins
a man very famous in marciall prowesse,
Lomen the kings secretarie, a man of greate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimation
<pb n="lXXVI" facs="tcp:4447:40"/>
for his long seruice in the Courte,
and Chappes a lawyer neere fourscore yeare
olde, a man of great renowne in the Courte of
Paris. And bycause we haue made mention of
Angiers, we thinke it good not to omitte the
case of Masson de Riuers. This man was a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r
of the Church, and esteemed a singular ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
both in vertuousnesse of life, &amp; in excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of
wit and learning, &amp; was the first that had layd
the foundation of the Church at Paris. As sone
as the slaughter was begon at Paris. Monsorel
a most cruell enimie of the Religion, was sente
to Angiers in post to preuente all other that
might carie tidings of the murdering. As sone
as he came into the towne, he caused himselfe
to be brought to Massons house. There he met
Massons wife in the entrie, and gently saluted
hir, and after the maner of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, specially of
the Court, he kissed hir, and asked hir where
hir husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d was, she answered that he was wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in the garden, and by &amp; by she broughte
Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sorel, to hir husband, who ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly embraced
Masson and said vnto him: Canst thou tell why
I am come hither? It is to kill thee by the Kings
commaundement at this very instant time, for
so hath the king commaunded, as thou mayst
perceiue by these letters, and therewith he she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
<pb n="lXXVII" facs="tcp:4447:40"/>
him his dag ready charged. Masso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that he was not guiltie of any crime, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
this one thing only he besoughte him, to
giue him space to call to the mercie of God,
and to commende his spirit into Gods hande.
VVhiche prayer as soone as he had ended in
fewe wordes, he meekely receiued the death
offered by the other, and was shotte through
with a pellet and dyed.</p>
            <p>Now to retourne to Paris, the Admirals bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
being hanged vp by the heeles vppon the
common gallowes of Paris, as is aforesaid, the
Parisians went thither by heapes to see it. And
the Queene mother to feede hit eyes with that
spectacle, had a mind also to go thither, and she
caried with hir the king and both hir other
sonnes. But the nexte night following, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
was conueyed away, and (as it is thoughte)
buried. About that time, where as many of the
Court secretly muttered that the king shoulde
by this fact incurre dishonoure, not only amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
forreine nations, but also with all posteritie in
time to come for euer, Moruillier, of whome
we haue made mention before, one that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted
the principal lewde practiser and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
sycophant of all Fraunce, and the first au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoure
and chiefe meane of bringing the Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites
<pb n="lXXVIII" facs="tcp:4447:41"/>
into France, came to the Queene mother
and tolde hir that it was best that some of those
that were lately taken fleyng and hiding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
should for maners sake be brought to
open iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and after the accustomed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
should be enquired vpon, that they might
be condemned by the Sentence of certaine
iudges piked out for that purpose, and so ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
executed in sight of the people. There were
called to counsell herevpon Birage, Limege,
Thuan and Belleure. They not only allowed
Moruilliers opinion, but also gaue aduise, that
a man of hey made in figure for the Admirall
(for his body, as we haue saide, coulde not bee
fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d) should be dragged by the Boureau tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
the streates, his armes and ensignes of
honoure broken, his memorie condemned, his
castels and fermes rased, his children pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
infamous, vnnoble, and intestable, and all
the trees in his woods to be hewen downe to
the heighth of sixe foote. There was among
those that were apprehended, one Cauaignes,
master of Requests to the King, and Brique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mault,
of whome we haue before spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This
Briquemault had spente his time in seruice in
the old warres in the time of king Frauncis and
king Henry, and was for the warre accompted
<pb n="lXXIX" facs="tcp:4447:41"/>
a man of great experience among the best now
liuing, and was neare about threescore and ten
yeares olde. As sone as they were caried into
prison, there were presented vnto them all the
tormenter and the hangman, and they were
threatned with torture and tearing their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
in peeces, vnlesse they woulde presentlye
subscribe with their owne hand, that they were
of counsell with the Admirall to kill the King
and his brethren, and the Queene mother, and
the king of Nauarre. They all cryed out that
they were readye to suffer deathe most wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
forasmuche as the kings pleasure was it
should be so: but so great torture they coulde
not beare, and therefore humbly besought his
royall goodnesse and clemencie to pardon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that torment, and yet trusting vpon the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of God, they hoped that they should suffer
exceeding great paynes, rather than staine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
with so great shame, or confesse an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true
crime against themselues. They that were
first assigned their iudges, hearing their cryes
and defenses, and fearing the iudgemente of
the worlde, saide plainly that they would not
drawe vpon themselues moste assured infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
for condemning them. Therefore there
were newe iudges appointed in their places: to
<pb n="lxxx" facs="tcp:4447:42"/>
them was adioyned such a tormenter and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarie,
as were thoughte fittest for the purpose.
And so Briquemault &amp; Cauaignes were quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
condemned by a shadowed forme of lawe,
and led to the gibbet standing in the principall
strete of the towne, and in sight of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of men gazing at them. To this spectacle
the Queene mother ledde the King and hir
other sonnes, and hir sonne in lawe the King
of Nauarre.</p>
            <p>It was thought commodious for playing of
this last acte, that Briquema<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lt should in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of all the people aske pardon of the king,
and for that purpose there were some subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to put him in minde, that if he woulde he
might easily purchase his life, for the king was
of nature full of clemencie and mercy, and if
he woulde aske pardon of his maiestie with
confessing his offence, he shoulde easily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it. He answered with a valiaunt and bold
courage, that it was not his part but the kings
to aske pardon of God for this fault, and that
he would neuer craue forgiuenesse of that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
wherof he well knew himselfe and had
God to witnesse that he was cleare and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.
Neuerthelesse, he besought God to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
the king this fault. So were these two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="lXXXI" facs="tcp:4447:42"/>
and famous men with halters fastened
aboute their necks throwne by the hangman
from the ladder and hanged, and there withall
also the man of strawe made for figure of the
Admirall, was tied fast and hanged with them,
after a preposterous order of lawe, wherby the
Admirall was first slayne and then condemned.</p>
            <p>But wheras in a manner in all townes there
were great slaughters committed, yet was there
none more horrible nor more outragious than
the butcherly murder at Lions. So soone as the
letters from the Court were brought to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delot
gouernour of the towne: first, by a cryer
and trumpet he caused to be proclaymed, that
all the professours of the Religion shoulde ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
presently before him at his house. They
without all delay repayred to him. As soone as
they were come, he commaunded them all to
suffer themselues to be led to priso by such of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
as should be assigned them. They obeyed
his word and followed the officers that led the.
By reason of the great multitude, they sorted
them into sundry prisons. Then Mandelot
willed the common executioner to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
in his name to take some to helpe
him, and to kill those that were in prison. The
executioner aunswered, that he vsed not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
<pb n="lXXXII" facs="tcp:4447:43"/>
the law vpon any but such as were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
and in publike and open places, and
therefore willed him to seeke another slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
man if he would. Mandelot thus refused by
the executioner, commaunded the garrison
souldiers of the castle to do it. The souldiers
aunswered that it was against their honoure, to
vse weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon men bound and lying suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
before them. If they had raysed any rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
or had offended or prouoked them, they
said they would most readily haue fought with
them. Beeing thus refused by them also, at the
last he committed the matter to the watermen
and butchers. Those fellowes being let into the
prisons, wente to it with chopping kniues and
butchers axes. Such as they found prostrate at
their feete, pite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>sly holding vp their hands to
heauen, crying vppon the mercie of God and
men, they did for sport cut off their fingers and
the toppes of their handes, and throughout the
whole towne was heard such a crie and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
howling of women and children, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
people, euen suche as were zelously
giuen euen to the popish Religion, did detest
that crueltie, and iudged that not me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
sauage beastes in shape of men were
entred into the prisons. It is well knowne, that
<pb n="lXXXIII" facs="tcp:4447:43"/>
a great number of honest women in the towne
great with childe, were so ſlighted with the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of it, that they were deliuered befor their
time. And out of the Courte of the gaole called
the Archbishops prison, the bloud was seene in
the broad day light, to the great abhorring and
feare of many that beheld it, runne warme and
smoking into the next stretes of the town, and
so downe into the Riuer of Sene. There was
in that fame Archbishops prison an aged man
called Francis Collut, a marchant of cappes, and
two yong men his sonnes, whome he had eucr
caused diligently to be taught and instructed
in Religion. VVhen he sawe the butchers come
towarde him with their Axes, he began to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
his children not to refuse the death offred
by God For (said he) it is the perpetuall destinie
of Religion, and that often suche sacrifices do
betide in christian Churches, and Christians in
all ages haue euer bene and for euer to the
worlds end so shalbe as sheepe among wolues,
doues among hawkes, and sacrifices among
priests: Then the old father embraced his two
yong sonnes, and lying flat on the ground with
them, crying aloude vpon the mercie of God,
was with many wounds both he and his sonnes
slaughtered by those butchers: and long time
<pb n="lXXXIIII" facs="tcp:4447:44"/>
afterward their three bodies had knit together
yelded a piteous spectacle to many that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
them. In the meane time Mandelot in iest
and soorne (as it seemed) caused to be proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the cryer, that no man shoulde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte
any slaughter in the towne, and that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
woulde detect the doers of any such slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
he woulde giue him a hundred crownes in
reward for his information. And from that
time they ceassed not to kill, to robbe and to
spoyle. The nexte day after, which was the first
day of September, the greatest parte of the
dead bodies were throwen into the Riuer of
Sene, and the rest of them Mandelot, to feede
and glut his eyes and heart with bloud, caused
to be caried by boate to the other side of the
water, and there to be throwen downe vppon
the greene grasse nere vnto the Abbey called
Esne. There the people of Lions, specially the
Italians, of whom by reason of the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te there
is great store in the towne, satisfied their eyes a
while, and did such spites as they could to these
heapes of carcases, and so exercised their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie
not vppon the liuing only, but also vpon
the dead. And there hapned one thing whiche
for the abhominable crueltie is not to be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
There came to that spectacle certaine apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries,
<pb n="lXXXV" facs="tcp:4447:44"/>
and among these bodies they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
some verye fat ones, by and by they
went to the butchers, and told them that they
did vse to make certaine special medicines of
mans greace, and that they might make some
profite thereof. VVhiche as soone as the but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
vnderstoode, they ranne to the heapes
and chose out the fattest, and launced them
with their kniues, and pulled out the fat, and
sold it for money to the apothecaries.</p>
            <p>VVhile these things were doing at Lions,
the king being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with faire words to allure and call them home

with those slaughters and horrible butcheries,
and that he would that such crueltie should be

of the king and with the letters of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours,
<pb n="lXXXVI" facs="tcp:4447:45"/>
retired home againe to their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
and houses, speciallye they of Rhoan,
Diepe, and Tholouse. There were scant two
dayes passed when they were againe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to prison, where they were all shutte vp.
Then were murderers a new appointed of the
most base and rascall of the people, to torment
them with all kind of torture, and then to slaye
them. And throughout the whole realme of
Fraunce for thirtie dayes togither there was no
ende of killing, slaying and robbing, so that at
this day there are about a hundreth thousande
little babes, widowes and children, that were
well borne, that now fatherlesse and mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
live wandering and in beggerie. Aboute
this time the King caused to be proclaimed,
that such as had any office or place of charge,
vnlesse they would spedily returne to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike,
Apostolique and Romishe Churche,
should giue ouer those their temporall roomes.
There was no towne nor any so small a village
or hamlet wherin all the professors of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wer
not compelled either to go to Masse,
or presently to take the sword into their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somes:
and in many places it happened that
such as being amazed with the sodainenesse of
the matter had abiured their Religion, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="lXXXVII" facs="tcp:4447:45"/>
were afterward slaine,</p>
            <p>And while these things were still in doing,
yet the king in the meane while sent abrod his
letters and messages into all partes, and caused
to be proclaimed with trumpet, that his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
was that the Edictes of pacification should
be obserued: and although they coulde not
haue freedome to vse and exercise their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in open places, yet they should haue liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
permitted them to retaine and professe it
within their owne houses, and that no man
should medle with or disturbe the goods and
possessions of those of the Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the same King which but fewe dayes
before, had by letters directed to all the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of his Prouinces signified that his cousin
the Admirall was slaine by the Duke of Guise
to his great sorowe, and that himselfe was in
great daunger, the same King I say, now cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
it with sound of trumpet to be proclaimed
that the trayterous and wicked Admirall was
slaine by his will and commaundement. He
that in fewe dayes before had by newe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
confirmed the libertie of Religion permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by his Edicts of pacification, the same king

Maiestie had set for the Admirals suretie and

in his companie, as the like also was committed
vpon others in the Citie, the matter growing in
the verie same instant to suche an outrage and
commotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that whereas his Maiestie had thought
to prouide remedie for appeasing therof, he had
much a doe with all his Gardes to kepe his house
at Louure, where he lodged with the two Queens,
his mother and the Spouse, the Lords his brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
the King of Nauarre and other Princes. Thinke
therefore ye noble Seigniours, in what a perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
this yong and couragious King now standeth,
who, as a man may saye, hath helde in his hande
thornes in steade of a Scepter euer since his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

haue almost euer since beene in his Realme, and
therefore by the good and wise counsell and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Queene his mother and the Lords his

brethren, thought to enioy and establishe a more
sure repose in his Realme, and a more happie go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement
for himselfe and his subiectes, after he
had taken away (as he thought) all occasions of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentions
amongst his subiectes by the meanes of
his Edicts of Pacifications, and of the mariage of
the King of Nauarre to the Ladie his sister, and
the Prince of Code to Madome de Neuers Besides
all this, to the intent nothing should be lefte vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
that mighte serue for the quieting of all

his Maiestie as euery man knoweth, hath done his

VVhich is the principall thing, noble Seigniours,
that his Maiestie hath commaunded vs on his
parte to assure you, and to let you vnderstand the
daungers that depende ouer him and his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
not so much for this sedition, for he trus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
in God that shall growe no further, and his
Maiestie wil kepe his Realme in as good repose as

such preachings and assemblies, and if they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
it is certaine that it wil be a cause to encrease

they should cause them to cease off vntill he hath
otherwise prouided and appointed, and that they
applie themselues herevnto as a thing greatly ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the effect of his intention, which is gently to
bring his sayd subiects to a true and perfect ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

And bicause this may seme <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

my L. of Charnye shall cause it to be faire and

them which conforme them selues to his

shall assure them in so doyng to be surely main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

his Maiesties pleasure neither is nor hath bene

cause it also to be as straightly executed. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

is the accusations and complaintes of
them of the Religion against him, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
he shoulde haue care to answere.</head>
               <p>M. De Gordes, by your letters of the first
of this moneth I perceiued the order
which you appoynted in your Gouernement since
the aduertisement which you had of the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Admirall and his adherentes: and since
I am sure you forgot nothing which you thought
might serue for your assuraunce of those places
wherof you had occasion to doubt. And to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
you shoulde haue the more meanes to make
your selfe knowne, I haue prepared that the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
of Corsica which I had appointed to go into
Prouince, should returne to you, and therevpon
haue written to my Cousin the Counte of Tende,
who will not faile to send them vnto you, for as
much as there is no neede of them now in that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
He should also send you word of the time
of their departing, to the ende that you might
haue laysure to prouide to receiue them, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
their places where they should be in garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
<pb n="CXIIII" facs="tcp:4447:59"/>
I haue seen that which you writ to me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall payment in Daulphine, what
is due for the last yeare, whervpon I will aduise
of the state of my sines the meanes that may be,
and according thervnto there shalbe no fault, but
they shal be prouided for. For the reparation of
the Bridge of Grenoble, they of the same place
must deuise the meanes wherin they should best
helpe them selues therin, and when they haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised
me, I will appoint them necessarie proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
Touching the souldiers appointed for the
Baron of Adresse, bicause the occasion why I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be leuied now ceaseth, I haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to him to send them backe and dismysse them
againe: wherfore there is no neede to make proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for their maintenance, nor likewise to tell you
any thing else concerning the answeres which you
haue made to the remembrances which they of the
Religion haue presented against you. For your
doyngs are well knowne and plaine vnto me, and
thervpon I will take no better proofe than their
accusation. VVherfore you shall put yourselfe to
no more paine on that side. Moreouer I haue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
sent you a copie of the declaration which I
made of the Admirals death and his adherents, &amp;
made to be vnderstoode that it should be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

and violences should cease. Neuerthelesse I haue
heard complaints of diuerse places that such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
wayes continue, which is a thing, that
doth much displease me. By the meanes wherof I
aduise you, in doyng this charge once againe put
vnto you, that you giue order throughout your

to cease, and that the sayd declaration be
straightly obserued and kept, with punishing
those that withstand, so rigorously, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
thereof may serue for an example,
seyng my intent is that they should be punished as
behoueth, and to marke them which wincke or
dissemble therat. This present letter shall serue
also for an aduise of the receipt of those letters
which you wrote the .v. of this present, whereby
you send me word, that you receiued no message
by word of mouth from me, but onely letters of
the .xxij. xxiiij. and .xxviij. of the moneth passed,
whereof put your selfe to no further paine, for
that charge was only for such as then were neare

great mistrust if they should presently exercise
their offices after these freshe commotions, for
cause that the sayd offices be in their handes that

they of the new Religion be in dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger or bazard

discharge the sayd officers from the exercise of the
sayde offices, vntill he shall otherwise appoint.
And yet neuerthelesse, in the meane while, if

and for our saluation, descended from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
&amp;c. <hi>as in the beliefe of Morning prayer.</hi> I
beleeue likewise, acknowledge and confesse
all that which is contayned in the bookes as
well of the olde as of the newe testament,
approued by the sayde holie and Apostolike
church of Rome, according to the sense &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation

as false and erroneous. I acknowledge the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
Sacramentes of the sayde Catholike, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolike
and Romishe Churche, that they
were instituted by our L. Iesus Christ, and
that they be necessarie for the saluation of
mankind, although that all of them are not
of necessitie to be conferred to all, that is to
say. I confesse that the sayd seuen Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
are these, <hi>Baptisme, Confirmation, Eucharist</hi>
which is the Sacrament of the altar, <hi>Penance,
extreme vnction, Order, and Mariage,</hi> and that
the sayd Sacraments confer grace, &amp; that of
them, Baptisme, Confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; Order, can
not be reiterated without sacrilege. That the
sayd Sacraments haue the effect whiche the
sayd Church teacheth, and that the forme &amp;
<pb n="CXXVIII" facs="tcp:4447:66"/>
vsage wherwith they be ministred to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
is holie and necessarie. I acknowledge al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
that the holy Masse is a sacrifice and obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the verie bodie and bloud of our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
Iesus Christ vnder the forme of bread
and wyne mingled with water, whiche sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunces
of bread and wyne vnder the sayde
formes (are in the Masse by the words which
serue for consecration, sayd and pronounced
by the Priest) transubstanciated and trans for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
into the substance of the ſayd body and
blood of Iesus Christ. Notwithstanding, that
the qualities and accidentes remayne in the
sayd formes after the sayd consecration, and
that the Masse is holesome and profitable as
well for the quicke as the deade. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and confesse the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>comitance, that is to
say, that in receiuing the body of Iesus christ
vnder the forme of bread alone, I likewise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the blood of Iesus Christ. I confesse that
Prayer and intercession of Sainctes for the
quicke and the dead is holie, good and helth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for Christians, and is not contrary (for
any respect) to the glory of God. That pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
made in the Churche for the faithfull
which are dead, do profit them for the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of their sinnes, and lessening of their
<pb n="CXXIX" facs="tcp:4447:66"/>
paines incurred for the same. That there is a
Purgatorie where the soules abyding are suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured
by the prayers of the faythfull. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
that we muste honor and call vpon the
sainctes which raigne with Iesus Christ, and
that they make intercession for vs to God, &amp;
that their Reliques are to be worshipped. That
the commaundements and traditions of the
Catholike, Apostolike, and Romishe Church
as well they which pertaine to the forme and
ceremonies of diuine seruice, and to assist the
same, which I thinke be to drawe Christian
people to pitie and turning to their God; as
fasting, absteyning from meates, obseruation
of holy dayes, and ecclesiasticall pollicie, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the tradition of the Apostles and
holy Fathers continued since the primitiue
Church till this time, and afterwards brought
into the Church by the ordinances of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
receiued in the same of long and auncient
time, or of late, be good and holy, to the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
I will and ought to obey as prescribed &amp;
appointed by the holy ghost, the author and
director of that which serueth for the keping
of Christian Religion, and of the Catholike,
Apostolike, and Romaine Church. I beleeue
also and accepte all the articles of originall
<pb n="CXXX" facs="tcp:4447:67"/>
sinne, and of Iustification. I affirme assuredly
that we ought to haue and kepe the Images
of Iesus Christ, of his holy mother, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
saincts, and doe honor and reuerence vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them. I confesse the power of indulgence
and pardons to be left in the Church by Iesus
Christ, and the vſe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be verie health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
as also I acknowledge and confesse the
Church of Rome to be the mother and chief
of all Churches, and conducted by the holy
ghost: and that other pretended particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirations
against the same, come of the sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion
of the Deuill, the Prince of dissenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which woulde separate the vnion of the
mysticall body of the sauiour of the worlde.
Finally, I promise straightly to keepe all that
was ordayned at the last generall councell of
Trent, and promise to God and you, neuer
more to depart from the Catholike, Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
and Romaine Church: and if I do (which
God forbid) I submit my selfe to the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the canons of the sayd Church, made,
ordeyned, and appointed against them which
fall backe into Apostasie. The which Abiura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

the mischiefes and calamities which haue happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in this Realme, since these newe opinions haue
entred into mens spirites: Howe manye murders
haue bene caused by such which haue fallen from
<pb n="CXXXIII" facs="tcp:4447:68"/>
the right waye holden by their Auncestors. First
they made them separate them selues from the
Churche, then from their nexte of kinred, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to be estranged from the seruice of their king,
as a man may see since his raigne. And althoughe
the authors and heades of that side, would haue
couered their doyngs vnder the title of Religion
and conscience: yet their deedes and workes haue
shewen well inough that the name of Religion
was but a visarde to couer their driftes and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,
and vnder that pretence to assemble

to sweare in the cause vnder the title of disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and by suche wayes to turne them from the
naturall affection which they owe to the King,
and consequently from his obedience, being noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
that what commaundement so euer the

they haue not since his raigne obeyed him other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than pleased their heads. And contrariwise,
when their sayd heads commaunded them to arise
and take to their weapons, to set vpon Cities, to
burne Churches, to sacke and pill, to trouble the
Realme and fill it with bloud and fire, they which
went so astray to follow them, forgot all trust

be serued with any gentleman of his subiects

in the whiche also the king, following his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,

away all mistrust amongst his subiects, and to
quench the rising of discordes and seditions, that
all they of whom he is serued in honorable places,

discords and ciuill warres will not cease in a state
where there be many Religions, and that it is not

diuersities in Religion, but that he shall leese the
<pb n="CXXXV" facs="tcp:4447:69"/>
good will and beneuolence of his subiectes, yea
and they which are of a contrarie Religion to his,
desire nothing in their hart more than the change

so euer it be, his maiestie is resolued to make his
subiects liue in his Religion, and neuer to suffer
what so euer may betyde, that there shall be any

               <head>THE ANSVVERE OF THE
Gentlemen, Capitaines, Bugeses, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
being in the towne of Rochell, to the
commaundementes that haue bene giuen
them in the name of the King, to receiue
garrisons.</head>
               <p>WE the Gentlemen, Capitaines, Bugeſes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nowe being in this towne of Rochell, doe
giue answere to you Mounsier N. and to suche
commaundementes as you giue vs in the name of
<pb n="CXXXIX" facs="tcp:4447:71"/>
his Maiestie, that we can not acknowledge that
that which is signified vnto vs, and the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which you require that we should cause to
be published, dò proceede from his Maiestie. And
thereof we call to witnesse his Maiestie himselfe,
his letters of the .xxij. and .xxiiij. of August, his
owne signet, and the publishing of the same let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
by the which his sayd Maiestie layeth all the
fault of all the trouble lately happened, and of the
cruell slaughter done at Paris, vpon those of the
house of Guise, protesting that he had enough to
doe to keepe himselfe safe within his Castell of
Louure with those of his Garde. And we shall
neuer suffer our selues to be persuaded that so
foule an enterprise and so barbarous a slaughter
hath at any time entred into the mind of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie,
much lesse that the same hath bene done by
his expresse commaundement, as the paper impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
which you haue exhibited vnto vs, nor that
his Maiestie hath bene so ill aduised, as himself to
cut of his owne armes, or to defile the sacred wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of Madome his owne sister with the sheding
of so much noble and innocent bloud, and with the
shame of so cruell a fact to disteine the nation of
Fraunce and the bloud royall which hath hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
euer among all nations borne the name of
franke and courteous: nor that he hath had minde
<pb n="CXl" facs="tcp:4447:72"/>
to deliuer matter to writers to set forth a tragicall
historie, such as antiquitie hath neuer berd
speake of the like, and such as posteritie can not
reporte without horror. But that it was first
layd at Rome, and afterward hatched at Paris, by
the authors of all the troubles of Fraunce. And
howsoeuer it be, we are readie to maintaine that
out of the mouth of his Maiestie doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
hote &amp; cold, white and black, &amp; that he doth
not nowe say one thing and by and by an other, as
he should do if the paper that you present vnto
vs had passed from him, protesting that he will
inuiolably keepe his Edict, and immediatly brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the same in declaring that he commaunded
those murders to be committed, hauing also made
protestation before, that it is to his great griefe,
and done by the outrage and violence of those of
Guise against whom he was not able to make spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
resistance in time as his Maiestie desired. And
in this quarell, we the Gentlemen, Capitaines, and
other that make you this answere, are readie to
trie it by combat man to man, or otherwyse, to
maintaine the honour of our King against all
those that so prophane holy things, and as much
as in them lyeth do by such wordes and titles vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainously
defile the excellence of his Maiestie and
of the noble Princes of his bloude. VVhich wee
<pb n="CXLI" facs="tcp:4447:72"/>
maye righte well coniecture and estimate, by
the slaughters that are yet in doing, as well in the
towne of Paris as else where, vpon so many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen,
gentlemen and other, men, women and
children, and vpon a great number of yong schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
(the maintenance vnder God, of Realmes and
common weales in time to come) and by many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
barbarous, vnnaturall and vnmanly actes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
committed. VVe thinke therfore &amp; iudge
that herein treason is enterprised against the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of his Maiestie and of my lords his brethren,
&amp; that the Guisians meane to inuade the Crowne
of the Realme as they haue of long time practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and how so euer it be, we say that his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
is forced by the power that they haue taken
vpon them and vsurped by meane of the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
stirre of the commons of Paris. As for that
which they saye that the Admirall and those of
the Religion had conspired against the Kings
Maiestie and his brethren, these be allegations of
as great truth and of as good likehoode, as their
maner of proceeding in iustice hath hene orderly,
beginning at executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before examination of the
fact. But it is now no neede to tarrie for time to
discouer it, for the matter is plain to be seen with
eye and groped with hand, and all those of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishe
Religion that haue remaining any droppe
<pb n="CXLII" facs="tcp:4447:73"/>
of nature of man, doe confesse it and hold downe
their heads for shame, cursing both with hart &amp;
mouth the cruell executers of this abhominable
enterprise, and the wicked disturbers of common
quiet, which can yet no more suffer, than they he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
haue done, that this poore Realme shoulde
long enioye the benefite of that peace, which the
King alone next vnder God, had wisely caused to
be made and to be accordingly obserued, whereof
this Realme began to feele the good taste, to the
great contentment of all persons, except the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of peace and of this Realme, namely the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians.
Finally, when his Maiestie being oute of
their handes and power shall declare what is his
pleasure, we will endeuour vs to obey him in all
things, wherin our consciences, which are dedicate
to God alone, shall not be wounded, in which case
we will rather forsake the earth than heauen, and
our fraile and transitorie houses rather than the
heauenly mansons. But hetherto, the lawe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the duetie that we owe to our naturall
Prince, to the preseruation of his Crowne, and to
the safetie of our lyues, oure wiues and children,
doth commaund vs to stand vpon our garde, and
not to put vs in the mercie of those that haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
the same bloody commission from the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians
vnder the pretended name of the King, to
<pb n="CXLIII" facs="tcp:4447:73"/>
vse vs in the same manner as they haue wickedly,
traitorously and vnnaturally done to those about
his Maiestie, and as it were vnder his wings and
vnder the skirtes of his robe, which the traitors
stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers haue stained with the true French blood,
without that his Maiestie hath bene able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie
it, nor to staye their cursed attemptes: so
much lesse is he able now so farre off to defend vs
as he would, which his Maiesties good wil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
knowne vnto vs, doth arme vs for our
defenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and for the safegarde of our
liues, and of the priuileges which he
hath giuen vs, vntill such time as
he shal be able by himself to
defende vs against his
