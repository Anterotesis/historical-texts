            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE <hi>CHARLES MONTAGUE,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> Chancellor of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> One of the Lords of the Treasury, and One of His Majesty's most Honourable Privy Council, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have, methinks, a sort of Right to your Patronage for this Play, since to you alone I owe the Power of writing it; for it was <hi>YOU</hi> alone, by the most generous Action in the World, and done in the most generous and engageing Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that deliver'd me from Misfortunes that might else have oppress'd me, and made me incapable of all Attempts of this Nature. And that Satisfactiou a Poet finds in the Success of his Endeavours, I receive with infinite Additions, since it gives me an Opportunity of owning in Public <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he uncommon Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations I have to Mr. <hi>MONTAGUE</hi>'s Generosity. Our Acknowledgements and Thanks are All the Returns requir'd of us by Heav'n, and the Poet has no other to make to the <hi>Great,</hi> who, when dignify'd with <hi>your Virtues,</hi> Sir, are the true Images of Heav'n. There is a <hi>Pain</hi> in being <hi>Oblig'd</hi> to most Men, but there is so <hi>Reasonable a Vanity</hi> in Receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Favour from Mr. <hi>Montague</hi> (distinct from the Benefit) that we are fond of it, and that exalts the Satisfaction into a pleasure almost equal to the <hi>Power of Obliging.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But besides the Duty I am under of laying this Play, Sir, at <hi>Your</hi> Feet, it brings me this Advantage, that I secure my self from the Severe Censurers of <hi>Dedications,</hi> for Flatery here wou'd be an unpardonable <hi>Folly</hi> as well as <hi>Crime,</hi> a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous <hi>Falshood,</hi> that wou'd rather weaken, than support the <hi>Truth,</hi> and so instead of heightning I shou'd only debase the Character, I so much admire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49420:3"/>When a Poet, indeed, makes so imprudent a Choice, as to throw himself on a <hi>Poverty of Desert,</hi> he lies under a sort of Necessity of having a Recourse to the Embellishments of his Art; yet then, the Dawb is easily seen thro': For let the Poets pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to what they please, they can in Reality add no true Lustre to a Piece, that has not an <hi>Innate Worth.</hi> In spight of their Gilding, the baser Metal will soon appear to a nice Observer. But under this just, and more happy Choice, I have no occasion for <hi>Heigthings,</hi> no shadow of a Pretence to seek additional, when the Native Beauties are so numerous, and so perfect; to lose Those wou'd be to lose the <hi>Likeness</hi> in imaginary Charms, and that wou'd be to lose the Value of the <hi>Draught,</hi> for an Unaccountable and Useless indulgence to Fiction.</p>
            <p>Your <hi>Easiness</hi> of <hi>Access</hi>; your <hi>Affability</hi>; your admirable <hi>Address</hi> in the Dispatch of Business; the <hi>Vivacity</hi> of your <hi>Wit,</hi> your <hi>Penetration,</hi> and true <hi>Judgment</hi> in Books, Men, and in the most perplexing Affairs, and Exigencies of State; your <hi>Candor, Integrity, Justice,</hi> and <hi>Open Truth,</hi> with all the other <hi>Virtues,</hi> that make <hi>YOU,</hi> Sir, conspicuous, and your Friends and the Nation happy, are an evident Proof of this. But to shew the Advantages that <hi>Particulars,</hi> as well as the <hi>Public,</hi> receive from them every day, wou'd make a Volume of this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, and yet amount to no more, than what daily Experience, and the general <hi>Voice</hi> afford us; from which e'ry one says of Tou, what <hi>Horace</hi> said of <hi>Quintilius</hi> to <hi>Virgil.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>Cui Pudor, &amp; Justiciae soror</l>
               <l>Incorrupta Fides, nudaque Veritas,</l>
               <l>Quando ullum invenient Parem?</l>
            </q>
            <p>The Benefits the Nation has receiv'd from your <hi>Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration</hi> are too Numerous, too evident, and too important to suffer us to forget the <hi>Virtues,</hi> whence we derive them. 'Tis your Happiness, Sir, to have <hi>Oblig'd</hi> the bravest People, and the greatest King in the World; for such vast, and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Services, deserve the Name of <hi>OBLIGATIONS.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You found the <hi>STATE</hi> engag'd in a most important, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, and expensive <hi>War,</hi> for the <hi>Honour,</hi> and for the <hi>Safety</hi> of <hi>Europe</hi>; in which the Liberties of our Neighbring Nations, as well as of our own, lay at Stake; and in which
<pb facs="tcp:49420:3"/>
they all had so absolute a Dependence on <hi>US,</hi> that without our <hi>Extraordinary Help</hi> the whole Cause must have faln. At such a Time as this, at so very nice and difficult a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, <hi>Providence</hi> brought You from a private Life to do your <hi>Country,</hi> and all <hi>Europe,</hi> such <hi>stupendious Services,</hi> that Seven Years ago, wou'd have been look'd on, as impossible to be done, and <hi>Chymera</hi>'s to be promis'd.</p>
            <p>Money (next to the admirable Conduct of the greatest Prince, and General of the Age) was the <hi>Support,</hi> the <hi>Life,</hi> the <hi>Nerve</hi> of the <hi>War.</hi> The means of raising which, with all that <hi>Satisfaction</hi> and <hi>Ease</hi> to the People, as we have found it done, was a Talent Peculiar to your self. But as by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the <hi>War</hi> the Difficulty every Year encreas'd, so it gave every Year fresh Proofs of your Abilities, and how neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary your Administration was to make us <hi>Happy.</hi> But never was such a <hi>Tug</hi> of Iudgment, never was such a Noble, daring and necessary Undertaking, as the Alteration of the whole Coin of the Nation, by the villany of so many, corrupted to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Misery, and to the Ruin of our Trade, of our Glory, nay, of our very Liberties, and all that cou'd, or ought to be, dear to Mankind, had it not been for Your admirable <hi>Adress</hi> and <hi>Management</hi>: This dreadful Evil, that had been so many Years coming to a head, You, in a moment (as I may say) remov'd.</p>
            <p>Who is there that does not know? Who is there, that does not sensibly enjoy the Benefit of your Counsels, in this great and happy Turn of Affairs? Who is there, that as long, as he possessess the Advantage of this Service, can forget the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> the <hi>Judgment,</hi> and the <hi>unweary'd Industry,</hi> to which he chiefly owes it? In this you have oblig'd Posterity, as well as the Present Age, since both must derive their Wealth and Safety from Mr. <hi>Montague.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such Singular, and such Important Services as these, Sir, have gain'd you the most noble Testimony of Your <hi>Merit,</hi> that <hi>Man</hi> can desire, and which we have seen none but <hi>You</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. I mean that <hi>Publick Vote to your Honour, of the most August Assembly in the World, the HOUSE of COMMONS.</hi> The Vote of that <hi>HOUSE OF COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONS,</hi>

            </p>

               <hi>Resolv'd, That 'tis the Opinion of this House, that the Honorable</hi> Charles Montague, <hi>
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> Chancellor of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, for his good Services to this Government, does deserve his Majesty's Favour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have put their own Words, because they are more Glorious, and Emphatic, than all the weak Flourishes of a false Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric. This is no Flatery of a Mercenary Pen, but the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the awful Iudgment of a <hi>HOUSE of COMMONS,</hi> that have all along had the impartial <hi>GOOD</hi> and <hi>HONOR</hi> of their Country perpetually in their Eye: a <hi>HOUSE of COMMONS,</hi> which no Considerations have yet been able to Byas from the divine <hi>Medium</hi> of <hi>RIGHT,</hi> and from whom nothing but a try'd and <hi>substantial Virtue,</hi> cou'd bear off so noble and distinctive a <hi>Mark</hi> of <hi>Honour.</hi> And in this they are the True Representatives of the <hi>English Nation,</hi> which, nobly jealous of their Liberties, will be sooth'd by no gaudy Shew, no meer Appearance; <hi>Virtue</hi> alone must win their Love, as Yours has done. For this <hi>Vote</hi> is the <hi>Voice</hi> of the People, not excepting your very Enemies, who are yours only, as they are so to that Government, to the support of which your Wisdom, your Industry, and your Virtue do so much contribute.</p>
            <p>You, <hi>Sir,</hi> have the Happiness at once to have the <hi>Love</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> and the <hi>peculiar Favour</hi> of your <hi>King,</hi> which is a Soveraign Mark of undoubted Merit. And there can be n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Your Iudgment in Poetry, ought to make me dread your <hi>Censure</hi>; but your <hi>Candour</hi> and <hi>Generosity</hi> forbid my Fears, and make me hope you will, with some honorable Iudges, that are pleas'd to approve it, excuse my <hi>Defects</hi> for the <hi>Usefulness</hi> and <hi>Boldness</hi> of the <hi>Attempt,</hi> from whence the <hi>Stage</hi> may get the Advantage of Encouraging some better Pens to go on with the Design. Yet this I may say for my Performance, that I am free from all that <hi>Immodesty, Immorality</hi> and <hi>Profaness,</hi> objected by a late Author, against our Modern Plays, and I'm confident, that he himself (that is so industrious at perverting the Meaning of the Poets, and giving their Words a most false and malicious Turn) will not be able to fix any shadow of an Accusation on this Play.</p>

            <p>'TIS not that I'm fond of following the Mode of <hi>Prefacing,</hi> that I trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Reader with this; but, because I lie under, what I esteem one of the greatest <hi>Duties</hi> of Mankind, that of <hi>Gratitude</hi> to a <hi>dead Hero,</hi> and <hi>living Friend,</hi> to make my Publick Acknowledgments for the helps I have had from them both, in the following Poem.</p>
            <p>That I owe a great many of its Beauties to the <hi>Immortal EURIPIDES,</hi> I look on as my <hi>Glory,</hi> not <hi>Crim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>; and I have so little to fear on that Account even from my <hi>Enemies,</hi> that I find their chief Objections is, that I have not follow'd him yet more close. But I hope, the Impartial-Reader that can, and will with Candor compare this Play with the <hi>Medea</hi> of <hi>EURIPIDES,</hi> will own that I had Reasons suffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ient to justifie my deffering from him in some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. For my Intention being to compose a Piece (if I could,) to Please <hi>our</hi> Audience; I was no farther to follow my <hi>great Master</hi> than both our Two <hi>Hearers</hi> agreed; but where their Sentiments differ'd, there I was oblig'd to forsake him, and comply with those who had my Profit, and what is much more in my Opinion, my <hi>Reputation</hi> in their Hands.</p>
            <p>The little Observation I had made of our Audience, gave me reason to think, that a Play after the Model of the Ancients, would be far from displeasing them, for I found that what delighted and transported them, was contain'd in a very little compass of those long Plays, that were in Possession of the Theatre, which was the chief Characters only, and the violent Emotions of their Passions; that the multiplicity of great Characters (under the spacious name of <hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>riety</hi>) divided their concern, and by consequence, render it of less force; and that the several inconsiderable Persons were only born with, for the sake of the Chief, and most passionate Parts. And this seems to me, to have been long ago observ'd by our admirable <hi>SHAKESPEAR,</hi> when he says,
<q>
                  <l>As when a well grac'd Actor leaves the Stage,</l>
                  <l>Our Eyes are IDLY bent on him that enters next,</l>
                  <l>Thinking his prattle to be TEDIOUS, &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now whatever is tedious, can never please; and therefore I concluded, that the paring off those Superfluities that only swell'd the Bulk, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to the end, could not render my undertaking less agreeable.</p>
            <p>

            <p>But for fear this shou'd not satisfie our <hi>sou'r</hi> Critics, (Custom will make me give them the generous Name <hi>Critics</hi>) that my alt'ring the Names of <hi>Medea</hi> and of <hi>Iason,</hi> is not so inexcuseable as they seem to make it; I shall pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>d to some, perhaps, of more force.</p>
            <p>I saw a necessity on my first perusal of <hi>EURIPIDES</hi> of alt'ring the two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hief Characters of the Play, in consideration of the different Temper and Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our several Audience. First I was Apprehensive, that <hi>Medea,</hi> as <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripides</hi> represents her, wou'd shock <hi>us.</hi> When we hear of her rearing her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to pieces, and the murdering her own Children, contrary to all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of <hi>Humanity</hi> and <hi>Mother-hood,</hi> we shou'd have been too impatient for her Punishment, to have expected the <hi>happy Event</hi> of her barbarous Revenge, nay, perhaps, not have allow'd the Character within the Compass of Nature; or at least decreed it more unfit for the Stage, than the Cruelties of <hi>Nero.</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in Nature not affording those just Lessons a Poet ought to reach his Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. But we shou'd with the extreamest Indignation have seen her (as Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> observes) at last furnish'd with a Flying Chariot to escape her just Punishment. Nor wou'd <hi>our</hi> Audience, I fear, ever have consider'd the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that might justifie <hi>Euripides</hi> in so uncommon a Character, <hi>viz, First,</hi> that <hi>Medea</hi> is the Instrument of the Gods to bring a wonderful Punishment of Perjury about, on those, whom <hi>Power</hi> had secured from all other means. Or <hi>Secondly,</hi> that he, by this Inhumanity of a Barbarian Woman, strove to deter the <hi>Athenians</hi> from Marriages with those, whom they generally estem'd Barbarous, and by that means, enforc'd by the most prevailing Motive Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, a known Law of <hi>Athens</hi> against any <hi>Athenians</hi> Marrying a Stranger. Or <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that <hi>Medea</hi> being the Grand-daughter of the <hi>SUN,</hi> had that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot as a Present from him. The Descendants of the Gods, (at least of so near a degree) being exempted, by the Pagan Theology, from the common Rules of Mankind, as if walking more at large, and being a superior, and more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confin'd sort of Beings.</p>
            <p>These considerations wou'd sufficiently justifie <hi>Euripides</hi>; but I cou'd not hope the whole, or ev'n the greater part of my Hearers, shou'd allow 'em as a Defence for me; and my Opinion was so far jus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ult of sleighted Love, lost her a great share of that pity I wish'd she might find. And this was the reason that I made use of those Advantages of the <hi>Heathen System</hi> of Divinity, which the Foundation of my Play allow'd me, as of <hi>Iuno,
<pb facs="tcp:49420:6"/>
Hymen,</hi> and her Father's Ghost, to fire her with that resentment her unhappy Love might else have smother'd; by this means to render her Revenge as in-involuntary an Act as possibly I cou'd; tho it was all along my own Opinion, that the Natural Effect of those Passions every one finds in himself, wou'd have mov'd our pity, when her yielding to their most violent impuls, had brought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that I cou'd not see how this, cou'd reasonably rob <hi>Althea</hi> of <hi>pity</hi>; since no unfortunate Character ought to be introduc'd on the Stage, without its Humane Frail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies to justifie its Misfortunes: For <hi>unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> Perfection, is the <hi>Crime</hi> of Providence, and to offer at that, is an Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a Poet ought never to be guilty of; being directly opposite to his duty of <hi>Rewarding the Innocent,</hi> and <hi>punishing the Guilty</hi>; and by that means, to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish a just notion of Providence in its most important Action, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mankind.</p>
            <p>This the great <hi>Sophocles</hi> has been notoriously guilty of in his <hi>Oedipus Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> where he punishes <hi>Oedipus</hi> for an <hi>Accident,</hi> as much as for the most <hi>Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Offences.</hi> For 'tis evident, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>that his <hi>Mind</hi> was ever so far from being guilty of <hi>Parricide</hi> and <hi>Incest,</hi> tha he always expresses the utmost horror of them. And his voluntary Banishment from <hi>Corinth,</hi> prov'd, that he had done all, that Man could do to avoid the threaten'd Evil. I know very well, that some pretend, that he was punish'd for his <hi>Curiousity</hi> and <hi>Rashness,</hi> not <hi>Parricide</hi> and <hi>Incest,</hi> but I can find no tollerable reason for this their Assertion. For, <hi>first,</hi> it is not to be gather'd from the Play it self, nor from the Moral of it; and next the <hi>Curiosity</hi> he was guilty of in consulting the <hi>Oracle,</hi> was so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Fault in the Heathen Religion, that it was one of its chief <hi>Duties</hi>; and then for a Man to defend himself against <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>everal insolent Assaulters, was rather an Act that merited a <hi>Reward,</hi> than <hi>Punishment,</hi> and <hi>Laius,</hi> not <hi>Oedipus,</hi> was here the Offender. The <hi>Grecians</hi> (as is evident from the Laws of <hi>Athens,</hi> &amp;c.) were too great lovers of <hi>Bravery,</hi> to encourage any passive Notions, and too Zealous for their Religious Rites to suffer any <hi>Moral,</hi> or <hi>Lesson</hi> of a Play to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them as <hi>foolish.</hi> But the miseries of a King or Tyrant, however brought about, were agreeable in a Democractic Government. And I'm apt to believe, <hi>Sophocles,</hi> in this, run along with the <hi>Sin</hi> of the Times, which entertain'd none of the most favourable Notions of Providence. And the Sons of <hi>Orpheus</hi> might well be guilty of complementing the depravity of Humane-kind with the Doctrine of <hi>Necessity,</hi> at the expence of Providence; since he himself had, by perverting Religion into Profane Mystery, and Evidence into Fables, scarce left the Deity one Attribute uncorrupted; and his Successors made the God-Head guilty of all those Crimes, which (according to them) were caus'd in his Family of Mankind by a <hi>fatal Necessity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return from this Digression, (into which I insensibly am faln) what I have faid, proves, that it is necessary that the <hi>unfortuna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Characters</hi> shou'd be guilty of some <hi>Frailties</hi> at least, to make Providence just in those Evils that fall upon them. And those <hi>Frailties</hi> that produce those Misfortunes being
<pb facs="tcp:49420:7"/>
what we may all be subject to, must cause our pity for the suff'ring Object; and this I think, wou'd demand it for <hi>Althea,</hi> if I had not in compliance with my Friends opinions, added those <hi>Machines</hi> to take off from her Guilt.</p>
            <p>But if these nice Judges cou'd not pardon her punishing the Guilty, by her Revenge, how wou'd they have born her destroying the Innocent, and those her own Children? For whom, Nature imprints in every Woman an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon tenderness. <hi>Althea</hi> runs mad for the Death of her Children, <hi>Medea</hi> in-humanly Butchers hers; which made <hi>Seneca</hi> give a very odd, and impious Conclusion to his Play on this Subject; when he makes <hi>Iason</hi> (when she's aloft in her Chariot) flying away, say,
<q>
                  <l>Per alta vade spatia, sublimi aethere</l>
                  <l>Testare nullos esse qua veberis deos.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This, I hope, is sufficient to justifie my altering the Character of <hi>Medea.</hi> I shall now proceed to that of <hi>IASON,</hi> which, however justifiable in the <hi>Original,</hi> I had some reason to fear wou'd not be forgiven in my <hi>Copy.</hi> In the first Scence of my Fourth Act, on their meeting after his forsaking her <hi>Iason,</hi> wou'd seem too harsh, rough, and Ungentleman-like, to a Lady on our Stage; for to this purpose is his first Speech to her;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I was always of opinion, that ungovern'd Anger was a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> impotent, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate Evil. Your own vain words (that hurt not me) have driven you to Exile; whereas, cou'd you have quietly born the Commands of Power, you might here calmly have enjoy'd your House, and Home. Continue to call me as you do, the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sligate of Men, I matter it not; but if you're Banish'd for what you vent against the Royal House, you may take your Exile as a favour. I endeavour'd to appease them, to remit your Banishment, but by your proceeding still foolishly to rail against them, you do not suffer for me, but your own exorbitant Tongue. But words do not make me desert my Friends, and therefore, Woman, I am come to know how I can be service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to you, that you may not go with your Childre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> destitue of Necessaries. For Exile brings inconvenencies enough of its own along with it; nor can I wish you evil, tho you hate me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must beg pardon that I have not put this Speech of <hi>Euripides</hi> into a better, and more Poetical dress, but that want of leisure will not permit; beside, I quote not this as a Specimen of his Poetry, but a Proof of the Character of <hi>Iason</hi>; which in my Opinion, wou'd have seem'd on our Stage too Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial Proud, and Inhumane an Address to a Woman he had unjustly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken, to whom he shou'd (in our Climate at least) have render'd his leaving her more soft and easie, but he after her passionate Reply, makes a more cruel and barbarous Answer, which in Prose is to this effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Woman, I find, I ought to be no small proficient in Eloquence, but like an artful Pilot sheer by that empty Loquacity of your. Since therefore you so extoll your Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, I must tell you, that</hi> Venus <hi>alone preserv'd my Life, as she alone was the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy of my Voyage; nor do I think that I'm oblig'd to any other, either of Gods or Men. Your Gall, and the sharp fertility of your Wit, furnish you with Words; but 'tis all but a meer arrogant boast of Speech, when you upbraid me with what Love compell'd you to do, that is, to deliver me from Dangers. I'll not attribute it to a worse Cause, but as you did assist me, I acknowledge it, and freely own the Favour. But I shall make it evident to you, that you've receiv'd greater Advantages from my Safety than my self. First, insteed of your own native</hi> barbarous <hi>Country, you enjoy</hi> Greece, <hi>where</hi> Law <hi>and</hi> Equity <hi>florish, and where</hi> Right <hi>gives not place to</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49420:7"/>
Favour, <hi>or to Force. Your Parts and Learning are made known to the polite</hi> Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>themselves, among them your</hi> Fame <hi>and</hi> Reputation <hi>is spread: Whereas if you had still been confin'd to those obscure remote parts of the Earth, you had liv'd and dy'd unknwon,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the same Speech he tells her, that <hi>Nature had done better to have found out some other way of propagating Mankind, than by Woman</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence of Women was arriv'd to that Degree, that an Injury to their Bed dissolv'd the strictest Friendship, and made them mortal</hi> Foes <hi>to them they</hi> Lov'd <hi>before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In need quote no more, to shew the Reader the Motive of my presuming to alter this Character too. For tho' <hi>Euripides,</hi> full of noble Thoughts of his Country, or to flatter his Country-men, makes it a Favour beyond any Reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, to be made an Inhabitant of <hi>Greece</hi>: Yet I fear'd that wou'd not be allow'd a Justification of such a manner of dealing here; therefore as <hi>Phaeton</hi> is young (the Age of Compassion) as well as Ambitions, I have given him a more generous sense of his Obligations. For tho' his <hi>Heart,</hi> and his <hi>Love,</hi> were not in his Power, yet it was always in his Power to endeavour to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his parting with a Woman that lov'd him, and to whom he had such uncommon Obligations, as easie as he possibly cou'd, and not to make this his Endeavours, seem'd too Barbarous to me, when there was no necessity of so cruel a Character. It must always be some Pain to a generous Temper not to be able to Love, where a Man is belov'd, and impossible to use a Woman harshly for the violent Effects of that <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being, as I thought, under an Obligation to make such Alterations in these two chief Characters, I confess I had not Assurance enough to keep the Names, my <hi>great Master</hi> had made use of, since that might be pardon'd in an <hi>Imitation,</hi> which wou'd not be forgiven in a <hi>Translation.</hi> I might indeed, had I thought it worth my while, have chosen other Names than what I have; but that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is so egregiously trifling, that I think it not worth an Answer.</p>
            <p>The next Objection my <hi>Hypercritics</hi> make, is, —against <hi>Phaeton</hi>'s being <hi>in Love with Two at the same time:</hi> But this, I am bold enough to say, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from want of Reflecting (a Crime our Critics are often guilty of) as I shall, I hope, make evident in the sequel of this Preface. But let a Play succeed, or not, Faults must be found, or some Men wou'd lose a Character they seem very fond of; for they have a peculiar Aversion to the being distinguish'd by their discovery of the Beauties and Excellencies of a Poem; but desire ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be known by their si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ting, turning and winding the best Performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to squeeze out at least the <hi>Shaddow</hi> of a Fault, if they miss the <hi>Substance</hi>; grosly mistaking the true Business of a Critic, and forgetting the Justice of the best of Critics (because a Poet) <hi>Horace,</hi> who says of himself.</p>
            <q>

               </l>
            </q>
            <p>I am far from imagining, that this Play, notwithstanding its <hi>Success,</hi> is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its Faults; for 'tis impossible any Man should produce a Work of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where the Principles of the Art are not Demonstrations, but what will be lyable to critical Disputes: For this very Reason the generous part of Men shou'd excuse what they may dislike, for the pains the Poet has been at to please them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49420:8"/>But besides these Gentlemen, who sowr'd with their Learning, are too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous, to have their little Endeavours of force enough to influence the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Poetry. I have another Sort of Readers to undeceive, who are much better Natur'd, and who may Condemn me through <hi>Ignorance,</hi> not <hi>Malice.</hi> Their want of Acquaintance with the <hi>Antients,</hi> may give them a prejudice to my <hi>uncommon Model.</hi> To do my self Justice with these, I am oblig'd to lay down a very succinct Account of the Difference betwixt the <hi>Antients</hi> and the <hi>Moderns,</hi> from which they will be the better able to pass a just Sentence on my Performance.</p>
            <p>First, the <hi>Antients</hi> to dismiss their Audience with that <hi>Pleasure</hi> and <hi>Profit</hi> they design'd them by their Plays, scarce ever extended their <hi>Tragedies</hi> to above half the Lengths of ours: For, by obliging the Mind to a too long Attention, they thought they shou'd make it grow dull, and tyr'd, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity render it less susceptible of those Ends they propos'd: Tho' the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion indeed was something lengthen'd by the singing of their <hi>Chorus,</hi> which answers the Musick I have brought in in Mine.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Moderns</hi> on the contrary generally Spin out theirs to an unreasonable Extent, by adding <hi>Under-plots,</hi> and several <hi>Persons,</hi> no way necessary to their Design, which was admirably avoided by the <hi>Ancients,</hi> by introducing no more Characters than were indispensably necessary to <hi>ONE Compleat Design.</hi> And in this I have endeavour'd, here to imitate them.</p>
            <p>Next the <hi>Antients</hi> differ'd from the <hi>Moderns,</hi> in the Choice of their <hi>Subject.</hi> We are for making the Scene of our Plays, the Field of Battle, a Siege, Camp, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where, what ever we do else, we are sure to keep the Audience awake with our Drums and Trumpets, and make them Laugh with our Battles and Rencounters on the Stage, when they ought to be more concern'd: The <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients</hi> never, as I can remember, chose such noisy Opportunities of pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the End they propos'd in their Tragedies, <hi>viz.</hi> the moving <hi>Terror</hi> and <hi>Compassion,</hi> which can never be touch'd, where such tumultuary Objects come in view.</p>
            <p>I urge not this, nor any other Argument here, to Reflect on those great Men of our Nation, who have follow'd this way; who finding it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd down to them from an Ignorant Age of the Theatre, thought, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, that no other way wou'd please, because this had been so long receiv'd. But I'm confident those who have so much excell'd others in this, wou'd have excell'd themselves in the more Natural Way of the Ancients.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Ancients</hi> differ'd from our Poets in their <hi>Incidents. We</hi> seek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter various, and surprizing Turns in the Fortune of the Persons introduc'd, which seldom or never happen in Common Life (the just Object of a <hi>Poet</hi>) and so very often lose all <hi>PROBABILITY,</hi> in what we <hi>falsly</hi> esteem <hi>AD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIRABLE.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, striving to draw, not the <hi>Passions,</hi> and <hi>Natural Inclinations</hi> of Man, by which we might inform the Reader and Hearer in himself, but the <hi>Fortune,</hi> which is something forraign and extrinsic, and the Faults of which lye sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in our power to amend. Whereas the <hi>Antients</hi> only (or chiefly at least) had regard to the Representation of Man in himself; and the Turns they made use of in their Tragedies (at least the most Beautiful of them) were of
<pb facs="tcp:49420:8"/>
the <hi>Passions,</hi> and not of the <hi>Fortune</hi> only, the Turns of which were ever so plac'd, as to give a better Light to the <hi>Passions</hi> they drew. In this too I have made it my Endeavours to imitate <hi>Them.</hi> In the first <hi>ACT</hi> I have aim'd a a Representation of the Turns, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d Sturglings, of an expiring Love, and one that is just rising. On one side <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Novelty</hi>; on the other <hi>Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>Use,</hi> contending with all their Force for the Mastery: The sure, and Experienc'd Love of the present Object, enforc'd with an uncommon Burst of Tenderness, prevailing, for that Instant, over the absent, and uncertain Beauty.</p>
            <p>This may, in some measure, Answer the Objection I hinted at before, of <hi>Phaeton</hi>'s being in Love with two at the same time; for a sensible and just Reader, or Hearer, would easily find that I had <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>certain Experience,</hi> not any <hi>Dogmatical</hi> Notions in my Eye, when I form'd that Scene. For a <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous,</hi> and an <hi>Amorous</hi> Man, when he passes from his <hi>first Love,</hi> to a <hi>new Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair,</hi> does not immediately loose all his former Tyes; but doubts a great while, which he loves best, his old Mistress, or his New; and may very well mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Effects of <hi>Use</hi> and <hi>Gratitude,</hi> for the Sentiments of <hi>Love,</hi> especially when these are encreas'd and magnify'd, (as in my First <hi>ACT</hi>) by all the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness of a constant <hi>Passion. Iustice, Gratitude,</hi> and a thousand other Motives, range themselves on the side of the <hi>Present Beauty,</hi> and experienc'd Charms, and may well hold the <hi>Mind</hi> in suspense a while, which <hi>Passion</hi> is the most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing. And as our Best Resolutions, are often broke by a present Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so I am very sure, that any young Man, in <hi>Phaeton</hi>'s Circumstance, wou'd have the same Sentiments. And as his present Love for <hi>Althea,</hi> might be the Effect of other Causes, so might that <hi>Passion</hi> he thought he had for <hi>Lybia,</hi> owe its greatest share to Ambition; as, on a further Thought, he himself seems to imagine,
<q>
                  <l>Love and Ambition bear such equal sway,</l>
                  <l>And have such blended Pow'r o'er my Soul,</l>
                  <l>That 'tis with Difficulty they're distinguish'd.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This I am certain every Man, that has his share of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Ambition,</hi> must experience in himself on the like occasion.</p>
            <p>But I must not forget <hi>Ovid,</hi> the Great Master of <hi>LOVE</hi> — Who justifies this particular in a much higher degree, in his Verses to <hi>Graecinus</hi>; in those he is positive that he Loves two at once: Whereas I only suppose here, that the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of other passions might in a Mind <hi>unsettl'd,</hi> be mistaken by <hi>Phaeton</hi> for those of Love; but to proceed.</p>
            <p>In the second Act, the Motions, and Turns of Anger betwixt the two Friends, and the resolving it into a seasonable Reconcilement, carry on my Imitation of the manner of the Ancients; and I hope that <hi>Phaeton</hi>'s Youth and Ambition, will make his Change in the Conclusion of the Act, sufficiently Natural.</p>
            <p>In the third Act I'm more secure, for there, I have closely follow'd the Divine <hi>Euripides,</hi> in the <hi>grief, despair, rage, dissimultation,</hi> and <hi>resentment</hi> of <hi>Althea</hi>; as I have in her several Passions in the fourth Act, and something more at a distance in the fifth.</p>
            <p>All just Critics have agreed in prefering <hi>Euripides</hi> to <hi>Sophocles</hi> himself, in his lively draught of the Passions. And therefore I cannot forgive <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s ill
<pb facs="tcp:49420:9"/>
Taste, in prefering <hi>Seneca</hi>'s abominable <hi>Medea</hi> (I mean in comparison of that of <hi>Euripides</hi>) to his. <hi>Seneca</hi> has nothing but a stiff, unnatural Affectation of <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiousness. Euripides</hi> is all free, easie, just, and natural; <hi>Seneca</hi> prepares no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>Euripides</hi> has an admirable Preparation of every thing, and this brings me to the last difference I shall now take notice of betwixt the <hi>Ancients</hi> and <hi>us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are fond of <hi>FINE THINGS,</hi> (as the Ladies call 'em) which common-Place-Books will supply to any moderately industrious dull Fellow, on all occasions. Nay, <hi>Seneca</hi> has store enough of them to set up half a score Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Authors, as admir'd as these Sentences are, tho generally unnatural; for no Man or Woman agitated by violent Passions, can naturally speak, what they call <hi>Fine things,</hi> and to bring in Persons without any <hi>concern</hi> in the business of the Play, wou'd be equally Faulty.</p>
            <p>I had some thoughts when I begun this Preface to say something of the Stile of the Play, and to have examin'd into what is the true <hi>sublime,</hi> and what is generally mistaken for it, many, both of the Ancients and Moderns, having affected a <hi>tumid, puffy</hi> Stile for the <hi>sublime</hi>; but this I have industriously avoided. <hi>One</hi> is only <hi>sound,</hi> the other, as <hi>Longinus</hi> observes is in the <hi>sense</hi> as well as <hi>words.</hi> Wherefore that Poet that's fond of Gigantic words without a Soul proportion'd to their vast Bulk, falls under the Censure of <hi>Horace.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Professus grandia turget —</l>
                  <l>and — <hi>dunvitat humum, nubes &amp; inania captet.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
               <hi>Statius</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> are two Authors that may give us a just Idea of the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>false Sublime. Statius</hi> is fond of the <hi>sound,</hi> and chooses words that fill the Mouth, indeed, but when the confussion which that makes, is over, you seek in vain for the <hi>sublimity</hi> of <hi>Thought,</hi> but find nothing but a <hi>sonorus emptyness,</hi> numberless <hi>Catachreses,</hi> and monstrous <hi>Hyperboles.</hi> On the contrary, <hi>Virgil</hi> is great, and magnificent in Expression; but it is not <hi>noisie,</hi> and always ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated with a Noble, and <hi>sublime sence</hi>; he is easie (like true Majesty) as well as great; he fires your mind, but does not confound it; he may be read for ever, some parts of <hi>Statius</hi> scarce once.</p>
            <p>But this Discourse is of too great an extent for me to pursue here, and my Preface is already swell'd to such a bulk, that I have scarce room to add a word of my Numbers, therefore, I shall only say, that I have often industriously affected a roughness in them, to avoid that <hi>satiety</hi> I find in many of our best Modern Plays, which proceeds from a perpetual Indentity of Cadence.</p>
            <p>What other Objections my <hi>Cavillers</hi> have made, I can easily loose the Sense of, in the satisfaction of the success of my Play, not only with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Spectators, but the best Judges of Poetry that I know in the Nation, as well as the most generously Candid, who, for the boldness of my imitation of the Ancients, forgave the faults I have commited in the performance. I'm sensible, and must own it to the World, that Mrs. <hi>Knight</hi>'s admirable Action was no small advantage to me; who is playing <hi>Althea,</hi> has evidently shew'd her self one of the formost Actresses of the Age. And we may say of her in <hi>playing,</hi> as <hi>Lassels</hi> says of <hi>Tasso</hi> in <hi>Potery, That he has hindred</hi> Virgil <hi>from being the</hi> only <hi>Poet</hi>; so has she prov'd that the <hi>English Stage</hi> has more than <hi>one</hi> Actreses. Nor indeed, do I complain of the <hi>Representation</hi>; Most of the Players doing me justice. But the <hi>Music</hi> was so admirable, that the best Judges tell me (for
<pb facs="tcp:49420:9"/>
I dare not give it as my own bare Sentiment) that there is the true <hi>Purcellian Air</hi> through the whole: that tho' it be so very different in the several Acts, it is every where Excellent; and that Mr. <hi>Daniel Purcells</hi> Composition in this Play is a certain Proof, that as long as he lives Mr. <hi>Henry Purcel</hi> will never die; or our <hi>English</hi> harmony give place to any of our Neighbours.</p>
            <p>As I begun my Preface with my Acknowledgement to the Divine <hi>Euripides,</hi> so I shall close it with owning my extraordinary Obligation to my Friend. The Character of Mr. <hi>Cheek</hi> is too well known to the Witty, and Conversible Part of the Town to need any <hi>Encomium</hi> from me; I am proud of being reckon'd among his Friends, and equally pleased with, and Vain of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Approbation of this Play, and the extraordinary Zeal he had shew'd for its success</p>
            <p>'Twas under his Protection, and the security of his Name, that it ascended the Stage, and got a Reputation before it was acted, and by that I am satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it met with a more favourable hearing on its first appearance. From his Judicious and friendly Correction, and Hints, it was secur'd from injuring his justly established Reputation of Wit and Poetry. The Obligation was uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and Merits a greater Return than my Abilities are capable of Making. For a Man of Sense is, and ought always to be very Cautious of hazarding a <hi>Good,</hi> that is got with so much difficulty from so envious, and so ungenerous a People as generally have the disposal of a mans Fame in that particular. And indeed if I had not entirely confided in his Judgment, as much as Friendship, I should not have desired him to put his to the hazard for my own Advantage. It wou'd be needless to repeat the particular Hints he gave me, or the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections he made in several parts of the Play upon its perusal. But I must own that the <hi>Castrophe,</hi> ows most of its Beauty to his advice. For tyr'd with writing the rest of the Play, I had hurry'd the Madness of <hi>Althea,</hi> with too much Precipitation, and without any apparent Cause. Which at first hearing he condemned and oblig'd me to write it over again, and alter it till it pleased him in the form you now find it.</p>
            <p>Since the Conclusion of the foregoing Preface, I have met with a Book, call'd <hi>a short View of the Immorality, and Profaneness</hi> of the <hi>English</hi> Stage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by <hi>Jeremy Collier,</hi> A. M.</p>
            <p>NO Man wou'd be more glad to see all Indecencies driven from the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Stage, than my self; but that desire ought not to influence me or any other Man to conjure up ten Thousand Devils of our own, and then lay 'em at the Expence of the Theatre. And yet this is the Conduct of this Younger <hi>Histrio-Mastix,</hi> I have no Room in this Place to shew all the Abuses, and Absurdities this Author is guilty of, but I reserve most of them for a work I have long design'd, and which I resolve to conclude some time this summer in Vindication of the Stage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now I shall only give you a tast of this fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Gentleman, by which you may Judge of the <hi>Man</hi> and his <hi>Honesty</hi> as well as <hi>Understanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The principal Heads of this Book are included in the <hi>Immodesty, Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and <hi>Immorality</hi> of the Stage, and the <hi>Clergy's being there abus'd.</hi> A word
<pb facs="tcp:49420:10"/>
to each. The first Point I can say little to, since he is not pleased to be any farther particular, than to make References to several Plays, which I have not by me at this Time; but I suppose they are Goblins of his own forming, as many of those are, which he has produc'd under the other heads. Under <hi>Profaness</hi> he Places the <hi>Swearing</hi> on the <hi>Stage</hi>; but to prove this he Quotes no Oaths, but an Interjection, that has very little Affinity to an <hi>Oath,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be because it has two letters of one of the Words, which do in reality compose One.</p>
            <p>I grant this Gentleman is no <hi>Friend</hi> to <hi>Oaths,</hi> yet his <hi>Zeal</hi> should not trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him out of his Princely Wits, or make him run into such a Whimsie in <hi>Etymology</hi> as a certain fellow did in <hi>Pedigre,</hi> to derive himself from King <hi>Pepin. Dipper, diaper; Napkin, Nepkin; Pipkin, King Pepin,</hi> as foolishly Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant as this seems, Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> is more so through great part of his Charge against our <hi>Stage,</hi> which to impartial Judges must seem very Innocent, when its professed Enemy is driven to the wretched Necessity of fixing forged Crimes upon it. If he replies, that the harmeless Interjection <hi>Gad</hi> is at least a <hi>vain Word,</hi> and therefore to be abandoned, I answer, that if the Poets must suffer for a few <hi>Vain Words,</hi> Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> has a much larger Account to make up, for a great part of his book will fall under that Condemnation. Another Branch of his <hi>Profaneness,</hi> is Abuse of <hi>Scripture.</hi> Nay he is full of Indignation to hear <hi>Ieremy,</hi> in <hi>Love for Love, Call the Natural Inclinations to Eating and Drinking,</hi> Whoreson Appetites. <hi>This is strange Language,</hi> pursues he, the <hi>Manichaeems,</hi> who <hi>made the Creation the work of the Devil, cou'd scarcely have been thus Course. Risum teneatis</hi>? They are our Authors own words I assure you, If this be not turning all the Theological Controversies into Redicule with a Vengeance I'm much mistaken.</p>
            <p>What this Gentleman understands by <hi>Whoreson</hi> I know not, but if our <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Inclinations</hi> are not to be spoke against at all, I'm sure few Preachers are Innocent, the fathers of the Church very guilty, and Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> at last as criminal in this particular as Mr. <hi>Congreve,</hi> for he himself calls our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Inclinations to Generation <hi>brutal,</hi> and which are fully as Natural as that to <hi>Eating</hi> and <hi>Drinking</hi>; to say nothing of Divine Injunction in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis.</hi> Now I can't help thinking that <hi>brutal,</hi> is to the full as infamous, and impious an Epithete for our <hi>Inclination,</hi> as <hi>Whoreson.</hi> Again he will have Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> guilty of no less than Blasphemy, for making <hi>Valentine</hi> in <hi>Love for Love</hi> say that he is <hi>Truth,</hi> because there is an Expression something like it in the <hi>holy Scriptures.</hi> At this way of arguing he may deny us the Use of the Whole <hi>Alphabet,</hi> because the Words of the <hi>Bible</hi> are composed out of it; or evidently cut out three parts of all <hi>the Languages, the Bible is translated into.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here he is angry at Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> for hitting by chance on two words which stood together in the <hi>New Testament</hi>? anon he is more Angry with Mr. <hi>Vanbrook,</hi> for altering the words of the Text in the <hi>Provok'd Wife.</hi> I find a man must be an admirable Pilot to Steer betwixt this <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charybdis.</hi> If he had been that <hi>Good Christian,</hi> or that <hi>Honest Man</hi> he wou'd be thought, he shou'd have shewn more Candor and Charity, than to put the worst, and most Scandalous Construction on any Gentleman of Honour and Probity's Meaning; for I dare, in Mr. <hi>Congreves</hi> Name, assert that the impious design
<pb facs="tcp:49420:10"/>
which this Author has coin'd out of his own head, was far from his thoughts and where there is any way to think well of a Man, that way ought cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to be taken, both by a Christian, and an honest Man. I have not Room here to bring the most evident demonstrations of Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> foul dealing, but I do not doubt in my Answer to his Book to prove, that he is guilty of greater <hi>Immorality, Profaneness</hi> and <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> than, from his Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, all or at least the greater part of the Authors, he has arraign'd, can be convicted of. If the publick Defamation of several Men of Reputation be Immorality, he is guilty of it. If to make <hi>half Quotations,</hi> put false, and forc'd as well as guilty Constructions on innocent Words, be dishonest, and Immoral, he is notoriously so. If (as shall be made evident) great part of the Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my he has Charg'd on the Stage, be but the Child of his own Malicious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, it must unavoidably follow that a great share of the Blasphemy in his Book is his own, and not the Poets.</p>
            <p>I have neither Room nor Leisure now to examine his Charge on the <hi>Stage,</hi> for abusing the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> so eminent for piety and Learning: if there be any such practice, I think it ought to be reformed. Yet he of all Men living, is the most unfitting Man to appear their Champion, who has made it his endeavours to make much the greater part of that <hi>Venerable Body</hi> pass for a company of <hi>perjured,</hi> and <hi>Mercenary Times-servers.</hi> But of this more hereafter.</p>
            <p>To insinuate himself with the Ladies, he has taken, in my Opinion, a very awkerd Method, for with all the Persons of the highest Quality, Virtue, and Learning of the Other Sex, he has fix'd an Infamy (I mean to his little Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) on all the Ladies of Honour, Piety, and Sense, who remarkably encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd those very Plays he would render so monstrous. He must argue them guilty of want of <hi>Honesty</hi> or <hi>Understanding,</hi> for tho' they are not by Blushes, or any publick Indication in the Theatre to shew their dislike of these things, yet by their absence they ought to discourage Blasphemy, and such Obscenety, that our Modest Author dare not transcribe. But from the Encouragement of these Plays, 'tis evident that Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> has a Notion of Words, and Things <hi>peculiar</hi> to himself, and shou'd therefore, to make himself understood, have given us the definitions of his Terms in the front of his book. Which I desire he may do before I publish mine in Vindication of the <hi>Stage</hi> against Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Collier</hi>; in which I question not, but I shall make evident that the Wit of Man can invent no way so efficacious, as Drammatick Poetry, to advance <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and the Supream duty of an <hi>English man,</hi> (next the Love of God which is always Supream) the Love of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, a Lesson I shall particularly Recommend the <hi>Stage</hi> for to Mr. <hi>Collier.</hi>

            <l>For Tragic Passions fam'd in every Age.</l>

            <l>Fixt in his Glory now Two Thousand Years,</l>
            <l>No puny Critick's weak Attaques he fears,</l>
            <l>O! that he could be try'd here by his Peers.</l>
            <l>Him the Wise <hi>Socrates</hi> alone wou'd see,</l>
            <l>(<hi>Socrates</hi> the Wisest by the Gods Decree.)</l>

            <l>This our New Poet boldly bid me say—</l>

            <l>He'l toil no more to give you wholsome Bread.</l>
            <l>But quit the Antients, and avoid th' Expence</l>
            <l>Of Nature, Probability, and Sense:</l>
            <l>And furnish out with Speed another Play,</l>
            <l>Of Empty Bombast in your Modern Way.</l>

               <l>On our Advice our Poet thinks not fit</l>
               <l>To trust his Fortune wholly to your Wit,</l>
               <l>For that's the Rock, on which he fears to Split.</l>
               <l>As much a surer way his Hopes t' Advance,</l>
               <l>He wisely borrows Ornaments from <hi>France.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Here's what you Use to to take so much Delight in,</l>
               <l>Musick, and Dance, and every thing but Fighting.</l>
               <l>And tho' he knew that always here wou'd please,</l>
               <l>He left it out to Complement the Peace.</l>
               <l>But yet for fear this shou'd not make you easie,</l>
               <l>He sent all us here, in hopes to please ye.</l>
               <l>For when a wanting Friend has often fail'd,</l>
               <l>With the rich Churl our Sex has soon prevail'd,</l>
               <l>Molded th' ingenerous Cully to their Mind,</l>
               <l>And made him prove most <hi>Prodigally</hi> kind,</l>
               <l>If then this Charming Tribe shou'd fail to win ye,</l>
               <l>I needs must say some strange dull Devil's in ye.</l>
               <l>Cannot our Eyes, our Youth, our Form appease ye?</l>
               <l>And have we Nothing?—Nothing that can please ye?</l>
               <l>Has Malice such Confounded Pow'r o're ye,</l>
               <l>That you will damn, tho' Youth, and Charms implore ye?</l>
               <l>—Well if your darling Envy damn this Play</l>
               <l>(At least before we've had a full third day)</l>

                  <l>The Priest o'th sudden started from the Victim,</l>

            <l>To give you the <hi>Desest</hi> of Epilogue;</l>
            <l>His Stock being Spent, has sent me here to borrow</l>

            <l>Gad I'm affraid to venture on the Pit.</l>
            <l>What if I hunted in the Side Box Rows?</l>
            <l>But who wou'd seek for wit among the Reaux?</l>
            <l>O! there's a twisted Stinkirk—but his Wits plac'd</l>
            <l>Preposterously from his Chin down to his Waste.</l>
            <l>Below his head, if any where, I'm sure</l>
            <l>His Brain can nothing but Pulvils endure.</l>
            <l>There's one well powder'd, gad and be looks bigg—</l>
            <l>And yet his Head is empty in a full Wigg.</l>
            <l>I know him—he's an old <hi>Halt-Act Peeper,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>A true Friend—I mean to our Door-keeper,</l>
            <l>To plunder there's a sin of that degree</l>
            <l>'Twou'd come within the Act of Immortality</l>
            <l>But there's a Cit—I'm sure that he has None—</l>

            <l>For City Security's wrist upon his Face.</l>
            <l>His Wit besides, another Way is Bent,</l>
            <l>As how t'evade some Act of Parliament.</l>
            <l>O! now I've found it—And be can't withstand it—</l>
            <l>Death! 'tis a Soldier! and his Wit's disbanded.</l>
            <l>No Beaux? no Wit! no sharper left to spark it,</l>
            <l>What a Plague are they all gone to <hi>New Market</hi>?</l>
