         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE

EMPIRE, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lords,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THere has been a great Hurly-burly about
the Death of Sir <hi>Edmund-Bury
Godfrey,</hi> publick Juſtice has made her
Report to Heaven, that he was murdered by the
Papiſts; but the Papiſts ſcandaliz'd at the
Wickedneſs of the Action, would fain have made
the World believe that he killed himſelf. My
Lords, 'tis well known, how far I have contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
my Perſonal pains, before and ſince that my
Advice to bring this noble Deſign to paſs. But I
think the Devil owes us a ſhame, we have always
the ill Luck to meet either with Fools or Knaves:
When it comes to the pinch, what we well contrive
is defeated, by the ill management of our Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
The <hi>Obſervator</hi> indeed did indifferent
well; for he gave a ſparring-blow at <hi>Praunce</hi>'s
Reputation, and back'd our Friend <hi>Thompſon</hi>
i'the very Nick, the very morning before the Trial.
I chuckl'd again when I heard of the Vintner's
Boys; they put me in mind of the St. <hi>Omers</hi>
Lads. But as for <hi>F.</hi> and <hi>P.</hi> and all their Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
<pb facs="tcp:104686:3"/>
'twas Money meerly thrown away. But
let us not deſpond my Lords, if one thing fails ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will hit, and we ſhall hit it at laſt: In the
mean time, 'tis my Advice, that you keep up the
<hi>Obſervator</hi>'s Spirits and double his Salary. It
will be a thorn i'their ſides that ſwore him at the
Queens Chappel, as long as he lives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Facit Indignatio Dialogos,</hi> my Lords—And
though the <hi>Heraclitick Cabal</hi> be of little
moment, let it not ſink: All helps, as the Wren
ſaid: But above all (ſince you may have ſo many
Proteſtant Bookſellers to do it) let the Ld. <hi>C</hi>'s
<hi>Vindication of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Catholicks,</hi> his
<hi>Memento,</hi> and the Ld. <hi>Stafford</hi>'s <hi>Memoirs</hi>
be reprinted. Thoſe Gentlemen puzzl'd the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with their <hi>if's</hi> and their <hi>ands,</hi> and <hi>how is
it poſſibles,</hi> at a ſtrange rate. They had a
brave Deſign to perſuade men out of their Reaſon
and their Senſes; and I am perſuaded all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in the <hi>Obſervator,</hi> and <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> will
believe in Them. I beſeech you, my Lords, take
theſe things into your Conſiderations; for you
have leiſure enough, and believe that <hi>ſhe</hi> will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
forſake you, unleſs you forſake <hi>her,</hi> who is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>THink on't? Why I think on't as bad as ever I
did: I think that the Papiſts did Murther Sir
<hi>Edmund-Bury Godfrey:</hi> and I think it was one of
the moſt horrid and barbarous murders that have been perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated
upon a private Perſon for many Ages.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Not ſo barbarous neither by what I can find by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
for they did not put him to any lingring torments:
they only flung the Handkercher about his Neck, and pull'd
i'the Devil's Name. The Turkiſh <hi>Mutes</hi> could not have done
it with more dexterity.</p>

               <p>Why ſo Malicious?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The Papiſts tell ye the reaſon themſelves,</hi> he had exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Did the Ruine of all their deſigns depend upon Sir

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>What e're they thought, it fell out ill for them. For
the Kingdom alarum'd by the firſt diſcoveries of the Plot,
was almoſt huſh't aſleep again by the double diligence of the
Plots true Friends and Abettors: The whole Nation ſeem'd
to have ſwallow'd <hi>Opium</hi> for a time, till the murther of this
innocent Gentleman, no body knew why nor by whom,
rouz'd it out of that Lethargic humour, and the loud Cries
of his blood put all honeſt men upon a diligent enquiry after
the Authors of the Murther, neither was it long before the
diſcovery was fully made out.</p>

            <sp>

            </p>
            <p>In the firſt place he braggs of the <hi>Education in the Fleſh, and his
Endowments of Grace,</hi> which <hi>Italy</hi> indeed, according to cuſtom,
connived at, but which <hi>Germany</hi> had like to have puniſhed with
the utmoſt ſeverity of her Laws, had not his neareſt Relations been
as careful then of his Redemption, as before of his <hi>Education.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next he tells us of his <hi>high Marriage, and his being made a Baron
by his late Majeſty.</hi> The more ingrateful he to turn Traitor to his
Prince, the moſt gratious Son of ſuch a gratious Father, to whom
he had been ſo paternally beholding.</p>
            <p>Then he boaſts his <hi>Sufferings for his Loyalty to the King.</hi> Not
ſo much it ſeems out of love of Loyalty, as out of Reward. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
K. <hi>Charl. 2d,</hi> did not ſatisfie his Expectation, therefore he mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
&amp; grumbled, &amp; entred into a Conſpiracy to take away his Life.</p>
            <p>For this, ſaith he, the Lord was <hi>accuſed of High Treaſon,</hi> and
becauſe he did not preſently betake him to his Heels, as a wiſer
man would have done, therefore he was innocent. But in ſuch
Caſes, to out-face danger is no ſign of Innocence. For <hi>Catiline</hi>
took his place in the Senate, when he knew his Conſpiracy was
detected; and <hi>Biron,</hi> though he knew himſelf engaged in a deep
deſign againſt his Prince, was ſo hardy as to appear before the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104686:5"/>
King to juſtifie himſelf, and to demand Juſtice upon his Accuſers; ſo idle a
thing it is to judge of Innocence by the daring boldneſs of the Criminal. Nor
was the over-confident <hi>Coleman</hi> the more innocent for approaching the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
Chambers at the ſame time that his own Treaſonable Letters were under
examination.</p>
            <p>After this he would inſinuate, that becauſe. as he ſays, <hi>the Evidence was
yet weak, for farther diſcovery, Indempnitys were promis'd, rewards propos'd, and
encouragement given by Proclamation to any that would make cut upon Oath th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of what was in ſubſtance already declar'd.</hi> Which he ſuppoſes to have
bin wrongfully done, or elſe why this inſinuation? And thus the King and
his Parliament are by a skulking Traytor accus'd of injuſtice at the firſt daſh.
And thus it is apparent that we are to expect from him nothing but Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
thrown upon our Sovereign and obtruſions upon the People, of the higheſt
nature. For as for Indempnities promis'd, there was all the reaſon in the
World; it not being to be thought, that any guilty perſons ſhould run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into a Halter, before they had ſome aſſurance of their lives. Nor were
they then ſafe neither, unleſs they made out to the diſcerning Judgment of
the King and his Council; what they alleadg'd to be Sacred Truth; and then
aſſuredly they deſerved their Indempnity, as it was but all the reaſon in the
World they ſhould have it. But this <hi>Impartial Gentleman</hi> would have had 'em
come in of their own accords, confeſs'd their Treaſons, and ſo his work had
bin done, by <hi>Stiffling the Plot in the birth of Diſcovery.</hi> But tho this were
for his Intereſt it was neither for the Kings nor the Nations.</p>
            <p>As for Rewards promis'd, there was no ſuch thing at firſt done, any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than to ſuch as ſhould come in and diſcover the Murtherers of <hi>Sir Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondbury
Godfrey.</hi> Which in ſuch caſes has bin the practice of thoſe in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in all Ages and Governments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and the like ſedulity of the King and the ſucceeding Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
(his Traytorſhip had as good have call'd it by ſome other enormous
name, for we know what he means) <hi>came in Captain</hi> Bedlow. Wherein he
<hi>moſt impartially</hi> tells a moſt notorious falſhood. For <hi>Bedlow</hi> came in of his own
accord, or rather, as he himſelf declar'd, by the Impulſe of Heaven, as being
convinc'd by the wicked Deſigns of Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi>'s fellow Conſpirators.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Next,</hi> faith he, <hi>Dugdale</hi> and <hi>Prance:</hi> by which wilful miſtake of order, he
driven on the continued fallacy of his Story: for <hi>Prance</hi> came not in, but was
accus'd by <hi>Bedlow</hi> and apprehended. Before <hi>Dugdale</hi> came in, <hi>Coleman</hi> and
<hi>Staley</hi> were both Executed; which gave the King ſuch high ſatisfaction, that
then indeed, and not before, he iſſued forth a Proclamation upon the <hi>28th.</hi> of
<hi>November,</hi> with offer of Pardon and Two hundred Pounds to any perſon
concern'd in the Plot, that would come in before the 25. of <hi>Decemb.</hi> For by
the Conviction of <hi>Staley,</hi> the malice of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> hearts appear'd, tho they
conceal'd it with better Diſcretion. By the Conviction of <hi>Coleman,</hi> the
whole Nation and they that doubted moſt were convinc'd of the Truth of
the Deſign. So that it was then high time for his Majeſty to uſe all poſſible
diligence to dive into the bootom of a Contrivance ſo deeply and villanouſly
laid. However, we may from hence take notice, that the Impudence of the
<hi>Papists</hi> is arrived at a ſtrange height, when their Champion, Mr. <hi>Impartiall,</hi>
ſhall dare to tax the King with Injuſtice for endeavouring his own, and the
preſervation of his Kingdom. Certainly they have ſome ſtrange Confidence
of ſudden Revolutions, which ought to make all true <hi>Proteſtants</hi> the more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant.</p>

               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:104686:6"/>
There is one thing more obſervable in the firſt Paragraph of this Section,
where he ſays, <hi>that</hi> Stafford <hi>was in his Impeachment, charg'd together with other
Papiſts.</hi> Speak out Sir, You ſhould have ſaid, <hi>Other Falſe Traytors.</hi> How fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
would Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi> mince the matter? But 'tis well known the Vicount
was not charg'd as a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> but as a <hi>Traytor.</hi> Nevertheleſs thoſe words <hi>Falſe
Traytors</hi> had too much Aloes in them for the niceneſs of <hi>Popiſh</hi> Maſtication:
however he might have ſwallow'd 'em for once, though it had bin only for
<hi>Impartialities</hi> ſake. But let Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi> mince the matter as he pleaſes, the
Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> was Charg'd as a Traytor with other <hi>Falſe Traytors</hi> nam'd in
his Impeachment, and ſo fell before a <hi>High Authority, Illuſtrious Judges, and
an Auguſt Aſſembly.</hi> All which being true, it argues a tranſcendent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
in Mr. <hi>Impartial,</hi> to encounter ſuch a <hi>High Authority, ſuch Illuſtrious
Judges,</hi> and <hi>ſuch an Auguſt Aſſembly,</hi> with his dwindling <hi>Memoirs.</hi> As if ſo
<hi>High an Authority,</hi> ſo <hi>Illuſtrious Judges,</hi> and ſo <hi>Auguſt an Aſſembly</hi> were not
competent Judges of <hi>Vicount Stafford</hi>'s Treaſons, and the validity of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.
Let the whole Nation take notice of that.</p>
            <p>After a recapitulation of the ſeveral Depoſitions he comes to the ſecond
Paragraph of this Section. which he calls the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Plea. Wherein he has
theſe words at the beginning. <hi>Wherefore though it be not my deſign to defend
Popery, yet I think it very pertinent and neceſſary to inſert here ſome of thoſe many
things the</hi> Papiſts <hi>in general did and do ſtill conſtantly alleadge in Vindication of
their Innocence.</hi> In which Lines he manifeſtly gives himſelf the Lye. For
he will not undertake to defend <hi>Popery,</hi> but will vindicate the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> as if
the <hi>Papiſts</hi> did not profeſs <hi>Popery.</hi> Pull off your Vizard Sir, that we may
know who you are: For there is a conſiderable Wager laid, that you your
ſelf are one of the bloudy Conſpirators themſelves. Now, if you are not,
win if you can. Elſe all the World will believe it impoſſible for any <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi>
to be ſo baulingly, yawlingly zealous to diſhonour his Prince and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Nation. Sir, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are Men of as much Learning, of as much
Knowledge, and as acute Judgments as ever the <hi>Papiſts</hi> were, ſince the firſt
Uſurpation of your Pope; Men free from the blinds of ſilly Superſtition,
Men of a clearer and more Noble Religion, which inſpires a clearer and more
illuminated Reaſon, than ever <hi>Popery</hi> could pretend to. And you muſt not
think that the Sence and Reaſon of the <hi>Protestant Engliſh</hi> Nation is ſo ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd,
that they cannot underſtand Truth from Falſhood without the aſſiſtance
of a piece of Monſtroſity in Nature, that appears <hi>Centaur</hi>-like, with two
ſhapes in one Body, <hi>Protestant</hi> before, <hi>Papiſt</hi> behind, or <hi>Papiſt</hi> before, <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi>
behind, no matter which; or if this <hi>Simile</hi> pleaſe not, like a <hi>Spread-Eagle</hi>
with two Necks. This is a meer piece of <hi>Papiſtical</hi> cunning, and pure
ſham, and already diſcover'd. You muſt profeſs your ſelf a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and
then the <hi>Papiſts</hi> muſt cry out. Oh! we are innocent, for the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
have defended our cauſe. You had better have appear'd as you are,
for double ſhapes muſt have double Tongues and double Hearts. Deal fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
now, and tell us what you had of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> for this laborious piece of
Ingenuity, and you ſhall have the ſame piece to anſwer your own Book; for
'tis the trick of a Mungr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l to bark at Friend and Foe. Well—but what ſay
your Employers the <hi>Papiſts?</hi> ſome <hi>Papiſtical Pharaohs</hi> certainly, that ſet you
thus to make Brick without Straw.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:104686:6"/>
The <hi>Papiſts</hi> plead, that 'tis not the clamour of the h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inouſneſs and horrour
of a Crim imputed, but the guilt and clear Conviction of a Crime prov'd, that
renders a man accountable to Juſtice.</p>
            <p>What a cunning Evaſion has Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi> found out? The ſtreſs of this
Plea lyes upon the words, <hi>imputed</hi> and <hi>prov'd.</hi> But Sir, Vicount <hi>Stafford</hi> did
not lye under the ſingle imputation of a Crime, but under an Impeachment in
Parliament of the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> which is many degrees beyond a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Imputation. It was <hi>Vox Populi, Vox Dei,</hi> no Clamour that proſecuted
the heinouſneſs and horrour of the Crime. Then for proof. He was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
by a proof allow'd of by a <hi>High Authority, Illuſtrious Judges, and an
Auguſt Aſſembly,</hi> and therefore moſt conſequently be guilty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond Plea is,</hi> That as Treaſon is the worſt of Crimes, ſo is the ſtain of
Innocent Bloud (when ſhed by Perjury) hard to be waſhed off.</p>
            <p>You ſhould have told us ſome News, Mr. <hi>Impartial,</hi> this is that which all
Men know. Where's your proof of any Act of Perjury committed? that you
ſhould have made out firſt, before you had thus maliciouſly gone about to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmear
the King and the Kingdom with ſuch a bloudy ſtain, as if they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off the <hi>Lord Staffords</hi> Head by Perjury. For the Inference is plain; and
if you pretend to be a Subject to the Monarch of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> I muſt tell
you, Mr. <hi>Impartial,</hi> your way of pleading for the <hi>Papiſts</hi> is very ſawcy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your next Plea is,</hi> That the Poſitive Swearing of every Perſon in every matter
or manner hand over head, is no Conviction of anothers Guilt.</p>
            <p>I know not what you mean by <hi>hand over head,</hi> unleſs it be to impoſe upon
the ignorant. But if there are any who underſtand not yet ſo much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they
are to know that the Teſtimony againſt Vicount <hi>Stafford,</hi> paſs'd all the ſoru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny
and ſifting imaginable of Both Houſes; the Lords of the Council, and
two Committees of Secreſie. The Attorney General alſo, the Sollicitor Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
and the Kings Council had the ſcanning of the <hi>Proof</hi>—And yet Mr.
<hi>Impartial</hi> is ſuch an unreaſonable man that nothing will ſatisfie him. What
prodigious Parts does Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi> aſpire to, that after ſo much ſerious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
and deliberation, he ſhould think ſo many Great, Venerable and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Perſonages ſhould not underſtand whether Witneſſes ſwore <hi>hand over
head</hi> or no, as well as a <hi>Popiſh Advocate.</hi> Certainly he muſt think ſo <hi>High an
Authority, ſuch Illustrious Judges; ſuch an Auguſt Aſſembly</hi> had very little to do
to put themſelves to the Solemn Trouble of hearing <hi>hand over head Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Papiſts <hi>next Plea is,</hi> That falſe Accuſations may be ſo laid, as that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
cannot poſſibly be demonſtrated by the Party accus'd; ſeeing no mortal Man
can diſtinctly prove where he was, and what he did, ſaid or heard every day and hour
of his life.</p>
            <p>Wonderful! how condeſcendingly does Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi> court and flatter the
aſſiſtance of his own Dreams. Alas, Sir, you may aſſure your Clients, that
there was no ſuch heavy task impos'd upon his Lordſhip as to be ſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
or ſo punctual. But ſuch Remarkable paſſages as Overt Acts of Treaſon,
the times and places of Conſultations and making Promiſes, nay large Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
too, are not ſo eaſily to be forgot, but that with a willing mind a man
might rub up his Memory. But what's the Grand Inference from this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
Aſſertion.</p>
            <p>1. That the Accuſer ought to be a credible Witneſs, that is not tainted with Crimes
and Villanies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:104686:7"/>
2. That Accuſers be ſtrengthened with probable Circumſtances, Circumſtances
that bring along with them ſome appearance of Truth diſtinct from the bare accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it ſelf.</p>
            <p>But neither of theſe two Eſſential Conditions are found in the Evidence given of
this pretended <hi>Plot. For Firſt,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>What manner of men the Witneſſes are, they who make theſe Diſcoveries,
how notorious, infamous; how ſtigmatiz'd with all ſorts of Felonies, Forgeries,
Cheats, Debaucheries and Wickedneſs.</hi>—Stop Sir—Now we are come to
the Devil's Sheepſhearing: here's <hi>a great Cry and little Wool:</hi> Why, Sir, you
know the Proverb, <hi>like will to like.</hi> Such as theſe were onely fit for your
Turns. You have been told often enough of this, and yet you will take no
notice of it, but bring your plauſible Stories over and over again. Who do you
think would undertake to Aſſaſſinate Princees but ſuch? Who do you think
would do the drudgery of your miſchief but ſuch? I am confident if you ſhould
expect to have had it done by any other hands you muſt have done it your
ſelves. But all this while here is onely clamour and noiſe, and the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Crimes. You tell us indeed of <hi>intelligent Proteſtants</hi> that know
much, and publick <hi>Records,</hi> but produce neither Perſons nor Parchment.
So then to give you an anſwer by your own words; <hi>It is not the clamour of
the heinouſneſs and horrour of a Crime imputed, but the clear Conviction of a Crime
prov'd, that renders a Man guilty and lyable to your Accuſations.</hi> But now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
they had been guilty of the Crimes you lay to their charge, and had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the reſt one more of being guilty of that Conſpiracy which you ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly
defend; if the King find they have been ſo conſiderably employed
in your Service, that they are able to do him ſervice in the diſcloſing and
bringing to puniſhment ſuch Traitors as your ſelf againſt his Perſon; and
to that end give them his Royal Pardon, in full of all Crimes and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and grant them <hi>firmam pacem fuam,</hi> whereby they become new men,
<hi>homines legales;</hi> and conſequently lawful Accuſers and Witneſſes: Will not
you allow them ſo much gratitude, as to lend ſo great a Benefactor the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of their Diſcovery, and their Teſtimony for the Preſervation of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and His Kingdom? 'Tis a common thing at every Gaol-Delivery to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
a little Rogue to hang a greater, The Pope himſelf would do what has
been done upon the ſame occaſion. For Example, can any man think that <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
the 4th. was ſo ungodly as not to reward thoſe that diſcovered to him the
Conſpiracy of <hi>Accolti:</hi> 'twas well for him there were Rogues i' the Company,
or elſe it might have coſt him his ſweet life. You know theſe things Mr. <hi>Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,</hi>
well enough, yet ſuch is your ambition to defend a bad Cauſe, that you
will vindicate Treaſon rather than want honour.</p>
            <p>Now for the Circumſtances, they do not pleaſe him at all. There are none
he ſays, <hi>confirm the bare Oath.</hi> No! that's ſtrange. There are the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of Time and Place: there are the Circumſtances, of <hi>by ſuch and ſuch
a Token;</hi> what would this Treaſon-varniſher have more? but of that let the
impartial Reader be Judge. That's nothing: they are a <hi>meer bundle of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,
moral impoſſibilities and nonſence.</hi> As how? <hi>Here is a Plot forſooth
contriv'd by the Papiſts.</hi> Is that ſuch a moral impoſſibility? 'Tis not the firſt
that they have contriv'd by the firſt in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Time, by the ſecond
in King <hi>James's</hi> Time, by the third in <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt's Time; and now
by the fourth in <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond's Time. 'Tis their frequent Practiſe;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104686:7"/>
you need not ſo much wonder at it. But it was <hi>at a Time when they had the leaſt
or rather no reaſon to ſeek changes;</hi> the fitteſt time in the world, when they thought
they were moſt truſted and leaſt ſuſpected. <hi>To kill the King; by whoſe merciful
Indulgence they lived in Peace.</hi> The more ungrateful Beaſts they. But what's
that to the purpoſe? they kill'd two of their own natural Sovereigns; and
is it ſuch a miracle they ſhould attempt the Life of a Heretick? <hi>To wade
through Bloud to an uncertain liberty, which they already ſufficiently enjoy'd;</hi> not
ſo ſufficiently neither; they wanted their Abby-Lands; their Prieſts lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Laſh of the penal Laws; and what they enjoyed was onely by ſtealth.
To free themſelves from which Bondage, they thought themſelves cockſure
of one ſtroke that would have done their buſineſs. And for wading in the
Bloud of Hereticks, 'tis as natural to a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> as bathing in a cool ſtream
in Summer. Witneſs the Maſſacres of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> the Monuments
of their Cruelty all over <hi>Germany, Piedmont;</hi> Q. <hi>Maries</hi> Perſecutions; and
the implacable and mercileſs cruelty of their Spaniſh Inquiſitior. <hi>But then to
overthrow the Government, for the</hi> Re-eſtabliſhment of which they ſo frankly
in <hi>the late Wars expoſ'd their Lives and Fortunes.</hi> This is a fair Story, but a
falſe one. For if there were any that expoſ'd their Lives and Fortunes in
the late Wars, they did it meerly for their own ends, for preſervation and
protection, as leſs fearing their Epiſcopal, then their Puritan Enemies. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will the Author of <hi>Vindiciae Caroli Regis,</hi> who had not a little reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin
the Popiſh Loyalty of that Time allow it to be otherwiſe; nay, he poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
aſſerts it for the true reaſon. But they were ſo far from expoſing their
Lives and Fortunes for the Government, that they as well fought againſt it in
the Field, inſomuch, that <hi>Salmonet,</hi> a Popiſh Prieſt, affirms in his Hiſtory of the
Troubles of <hi>England,</hi> that ſeveral Popiſh Prieſts were found dead among the
ſlain at <hi>Edghill;</hi> and beſides that ſeveral Roman Catholicks ſerv'd in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Army. And in one of his late Majeſtie's Declarations in anſwer to the
Long Parlaments falſe imputation of his favouring and employing Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
in his Army, we find theſe words, <hi>All men know the great number of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
which ſerve in their Army, Commanders and others.</hi> So your boaſting the
Papiſts ſo frankly expoſing their Lives and Fortunes for the late King, is a
meer <hi>Rodomontado,</hi> and the contrary is juſtified by the King himſelf: nay it is
plain by His own words in the ſame Declaration, that he forbad them to come
to his Succour. And therefore let Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi> not think to flatter the Nation
with ſuch an officious lye, under the pretence of a <hi>moral Improbability.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For 'tis the Roman Catholick Intereſt in this Nation, that Intereſt which
they can never recede from, not onely to abrogate the penal Laws, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
capable of employment in the Commonwealth, but to introduce their
Religion, reſtore the Rights of their Church, and extirpate all that they
eſteem as Hereticks. They that fondly otherwiſe believe, do but accelerate
the ruine of their Religion, and their Country. If there were any that
did well, to aſſiſt their Prince then, they did as ill now to Conſpire his
Deſtruction. Neither is it any reaſon, becauſe there may be ſome Papiſts
good Subjects, that others may not be as wicked, Which may in part
ſuffice to anſwer his next wonder. For we have nothing elſe but wonders and
miracles deliver'd for Arguments. Wonders that any man of ſenſe would
wonder how they ſhould be wonder'd at, but onely wonder-working Mr.
<hi>Impartial,</hi> As for Example, <hi>This Plot,</hi> ſaith He, <hi>muſt be carried on by Perſons of
Quality, moſt remarkable perhaps for firmneſs and Loyalty)</hi> that perhaps was
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104686:8"/>
well put in <hi>and now through Age and Infirmities, retired from publick buſineſs, and
weary of the world;</hi> that is in Engliſh Impeached of High Treaſon, and lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up in the Tower. Now I would fain know where the wonder lies, that
a <hi>Plot ſhould be carried on by Perſons of Quality.</hi> Perſons of Quality are moſt
apt to think themſelves injur'd; Perſons of Quality are moſt ſubject to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
and Perſons of Quality are moſt able to head Parties and Factions in
a Nation. Nay, rather, let Mr. Imparial tell me whereever any Plot was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on without Perſons of Quality? The very Plots of <hi>Simnel</hi> and <hi>Perkin
Warbeck</hi> were carried on by Perſons of Quality againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th. There
were more perſons of Quality in <hi>Bycons</hi> Conſpiracy, than <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th. would
venture to provoke by a preſent detection.</p>
            <p>What was the <hi>Holy League,</hi> while it was private, but a Plot, carried on by
the Pope himſelf, a perſon certainly of <hi>very great Quality,</hi> againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the
3d. And why might not their <hi>Popiſh Plot</hi> be managed by <hi>Perſons of Quality,</hi>
as well as other <hi>Popiſh Plots?</hi> And if ſo, why not by the perſons of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
accuſed, rather than others not accuſed. The Wonder is how thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of Quality have eſcaped their puniſhments ſo long as they have done.
That's a Wonder makes more people wonder, than will ever admire at Mr.
Impartial's ſilly, ſimple miracles of <hi>Perſons of Quality</hi> being in a <hi>Plot.</hi> But
then here's another Wonder, <hi>That the whole Body of Roman Catholicks,</hi> Men
before <hi>this hour, of known worth, virtue and integrity, and unblemiſhed Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
muſt be all involv'd by Vows and Sacraments in a Deſign ſo black and execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that God and nature abhor to think of it.</hi> Setting a ſide your Complement
to God and Nature, for God we verily believe is diſpleaſed with, and nature
abhors many foul deeds, which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> neither abhor, nor are diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with; the reſt of your Wonder, is a meer Hyperbolical Fallacy, as ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
as vanity it ſelf. For the Body of the Roman Catholicks, that is thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
which Mr. Impartial, for his Feo, calls perſons <hi>of known worth, virtue
integrity, and unblemiſhed Reputation,</hi> are the very perſons moſt likely to be
combin'd together in this Deſign, which he has leave from his Employers to
call <hi>black and execrable;</hi> for ſuch is the nature of Popiſh Bigottiſm; ſuch the
infatuated heat of its profeſſors; ſuch the awe and dread of their conſciences
under the charms of their Prieſthood: ſo pinching and terrible are the Chains
of their Oath; ſuch their inbred enmity to Hereticks that the more conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and devout they are they more religiouſly they believe themſelves bound
to conceal what ever deſigns are on foot for the propagation of the Romiſh
Intereſt, and the extirpation of <hi>Hereticks;</hi> ſo that if Mr. Impartial mean by
<hi>the whole Body of the Roman Catholicks,</hi> thoſe perſons whom he calls, <hi>men of
worth, virtue, integrity and uublemiſhed Reputation,</hi> that is, ſuch as the Grand
Conſpirators thought fit to truſt with their Intreague; 'tis but very weakly
ſuppoſed, that ſuch perſons ſhould think it any loſs of thoſe high Characters
which Mr. Impartial gives them; to conceal a deſign ſo highly to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> The whole Body, Mr. Impartial<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There is the
Juggle of your ſuppoſition. We do not believe the whole Body of Roman
Catholicks, knew of the blackneſs and execrableneſs of your Deſign; but
many were told by their Prieſts and Confeſſors, that there was a Deſign
carrying on for the good of the Catholick Cauſe; and that was neceſſary to
procure the Milk of Contribution. And ſo far this Nation has all the reaſon
to belieue, that the whole Body of Roman Catholicks was concern'd in this
<hi>Plot.</hi> Then for the loſs <hi>of</hi> their <hi>honour, and hazard of ruining themſelves and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104686:8"/>
their Families,</hi> they that were in darkneſs knew not their danger, and the reſt
knew there was little. For had they compaſs'd their ends, they had
had their advantages; and we are too deeply ſenſible that they had ſome
ſtrange aſſurances how little they ſhould ſuffer, if they <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

            <p>He goes on with a mighty wonder, if it be not a greater wonder that he
could be ſo impudent as to write it; <hi>In this Plot,</hi> ſays he, <hi>are ſaid to be engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for ſeveral years together divers Nations, England, Scotland, Ireland, France,
Italy, Spain, Germany, &amp;c.</hi> What a deal of high-flown Forgery and Fallacy

the <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants</hi> will let their indignation againſt the late diſcover'd
Plot be laid aſleep, they will not want for worſe. Where are thoſe Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Accuſations againſt all <hi>England,</hi> all <hi>Scotland,</hi> all <hi>France,</hi> all <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
all <hi>Spain,</hi> all <hi>Germany?</hi> No true <hi>Engliſhman</hi> can doubt but that for the
carrying on the Late Plot there were <hi>Romiſh</hi> Correſpondencies, <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondencies,
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Correſpondencies, and for the <hi>French</hi> Correſpondencies
we have teſtimony ſufficient. But to make Inferences from National Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations,
where never any were, was a <hi>Romance</hi> of Mr. <hi>Impartials</hi> own Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. And therefore to ſay truth, whoever undertook to put ſuch
fallacious ſhamms and tricks upon the already too much injur'd <hi>Engliſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi>
in the Vindication of Treaſon and Villany, deſerves more the <hi>Whip</hi>
and the Pillory, than thoſe perſons he calls <hi>rak'd out of Jayle:</hi> for no perſon
rak'd out of Hell can be worſe than himſelf. But yet to ſhew that there may
be that thing that comes very near a National Concealment of a Conſpiracy.
The Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> how cloſely, how cunningly was it managed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the leaſt Diſcovery till the Kingdom ran with Bloud, and <hi>Maſſaere</hi> lay in
heaps, <hi>yet none of all that vast number had any remorſe for ſo bloudy a Treaſon, none
all that while had the worth, wit of grace to reveal it. This was ſomewhat hard to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi>
and yet was true.</p>
            <p>Being got into his <hi>Romances</hi> he cannot get out of 'em, but goes on raving,
and ſtill amuſing the ignorant with a noiſe of Armies improbable for their
numbers; which is nothing to the purpoſe; for all this riffraff makes it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
the leſs improbable, but that Men engag'd in ſuch Deſigns of Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul
Maſſacre, intended convenient Levies, and convenient quantitys of Arms
and Ammunition for thoſe Levies, and therefore is a thing not ſo much to be
wondred at. 'Tis no matter for <hi>Number</hi> or <hi>Quantity,</hi> 'tis the intent of raiſing
Forces againſt the Eſtabliſh'd Government, and providing Arms and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
for theſe Forces, and that diſcours'd of, and conſulted upon that makes
the Treaſon our, as effectually in the eye of the Law, as if the Men had bin
Levy'd, or the Money paid into the Lord <hi>Staffords</hi> hands. So then, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of raiſing Forces, and the actual Banking of Money for Arms and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition
being poſitively ſworn, as it was, and all for carrying on this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable,
tho as deteſtably vindicated Plot, Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi> muſt not think to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſuch a Plot in the Rubbiſh of his impertinent Raillery.</p>
            <p>But he runs on in his Poetical Raptures (a very pretty way of refuting a
demonſtrated Plot) and crys, <hi>We are told of hundreds of Seal'd Commiſſions,
for all ſorts of Military Officers; and God knows how many Buſhels of Letters and
Papers, all containing moſt Damnable Treaſon, ſent nevertheleſs up and down at
random, ſome by the Common Post, others by ſuch Meſſengers as</hi> Oates, Bedlow,
Dugdale <hi>and</hi> Dangerfield, <hi>who, as boſom Counſellers, were ſtill made privy to what
was ſent.</hi> Underſtand Sir, once more, that number and quantity ſignifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104686:9"/>
and all your Hyperboles of <hi>Hunderds</hi> and <hi>Buſhels</hi> are not worth a Ruſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But where is the improbability of granting Commiſſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who more fit, or
who had greater Authority to grant theſe Commiſſions than the great Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of your Religion the Pope, from whom you and the reſt of the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarators,
deriv'd all their power. Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> whoſe Teſtimony your ridioulous
<hi>Memoirs,</hi> that have nothing in 'em but <hi>defamation</hi> and <hi>railing,</hi> can never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate,
tells ye of ſeveral Commiſſions that he gave to ſeveral perſons by
name himſelf. That <hi>Whitebreads</hi> Commiſſion together with ſeveral Papers
and Letters were ſeiz'd, at the ſame time that his perſon was apprehended.
At another time <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s Papers were ſeiz'd, and after that a plentiful
Parcel of Letters were publickly printed, full of Cyphers, all relating to the
Plot, then add to this, that ſeveral of your Seals have bin produc'd in Court.</p>
            <p>More than all this, there was nothing more frequently boaſted in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
diſcourſes of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> at that time one among another, then that the
<hi>Roman Catholick Religion would ſuddenly flouriſh in</hi> England, that they had <hi>conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Armies,</hi> raiſing for that purpoſe, and that the Lords in the Tower had
not only <hi>Commiſſions</hi> themſelves, but had given out Commiſſions to ſeveral
others, <hi>Viz.</hi> One to <hi>Talbot</hi> of <hi>Langford,</hi> another to Sir <hi>H. Beningfield</hi> of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi>
another to one Mr. <hi>Stoner,</hi> and ſeveral others, <hi>Ireland</hi> declar'd in
his own Chamber at that time, <hi>That there would ſhortly be fifty thouſand men
in Arms,</hi> and being ask'd for what? <hi>We muſt have them ſpeedily,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
our Religion here, or elſe all will be ruin'd.</hi> Which argu'd, that there were
plenty of <hi>Popiſh Commiſſions</hi> then in <hi>England,</hi> whate'r is become of them. But
Mr. <hi>Impartial,</hi> being a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> as he pretends, too eaſily, 'tis to be fear'd,
takes his Employers words. Where is next the improbability that your
Packets, tho full of <hi>damnable Treaſon,</hi> might not be ſent by the Common
Poſt? The King has no Inquiſitor that ſits in his Publick Office to break o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
Gentlemens Letters, and examine the Contents. More then that, there
was a Packet, and a large one too, ſent by the Common Poſt, directed to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Benningfield,</hi> that by a lucky fate to you and your Employers, miſt fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the hands of thoſe that would have made better uſe of it. Laſtly,
Where's the improbability that ſuch perſons as you ſtrive to defame, ſhould
not be truſted by thoſe profound Head-pieces your Employers. They were
under the ſame, as you call'd them, Sacred Oaths of Secreſie, and ſent to
be charm'd with your Idolatrous <hi>Eucharist</hi> thrice a Week. What great Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
had Vicount <hi>Stafford</hi> that he might not truſt <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſo firmly bound?
What more than ordinary piercing Wits or diſcerning Faculties had any of
the Lords in the Tower, that they might not truſt <hi>Dangerfield</hi> under the ſame
Sacred Obligation? Or what reach above common Women had that buſie,
Luſtful <hi>Cellier,</hi> ſhe that was your <hi>Jayle-raker,</hi> Sir, and not ours, I ſay, what
ſublimity of Judgment had ſhe, that ſhe might not truſt her ſo highly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd
Favourite? If they were not fit to be truſted, why had they thoſe Oaths
of Secreſie given them; why were they treated ſo often with thoſe Holy
Morſels at your Chappels? But if thoſe Religious Tyes were put upon them,
as moſt certainly they were, what wonder is it then they ſhould be truſted?
Certainly, were they thoſe Rakeſhames that the <hi>Worſhipful</hi> Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi>
makes of 'em; Solemn Oaths of Secreſie and the <hi>Eucharist</hi> go at a cheap rate
among the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that they ſhould be ſo often forc'd upon the <hi>Whip'd</hi> and
the <hi>Pillory'd,</hi> and the <hi>Infamous,</hi> meerly to be ſent to buy Mapps for a <hi>Jeſuites</hi>
Colledge, or to pick up a <hi>Broken Merchants Debts,</hi> So then it remains, that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104686:9"/>
theſe perſons that could not be other than <hi>Demy-Saints</hi> when they were <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi>
as having ſo much <hi>holy Wafer</hi> lodg'd in their Bodies, are only turn'd
Reprobates ſince they made their diſcoveries. Which being ſo plain, it is
not to be queſtion'd but that they had opportunities enough to make their
diſcoveries according to their various Truſts and Employments, as being
Perſons of Quality ſacredly bound up by ſo many holy Obligations as they
then believ'd they were. Since then it was impoſſible that among <hi>Papiſts</hi> they
could be Miſcreants, after ſo much <hi>Purification</hi> and <hi>Sanctification,</hi> tho with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Kings Pardon, we will make no diſpute to juſtifie their Honeſty, their
Integrity, and their Loyalty now they have obtain'd the Kings Forgiveneſs.
For the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are to underſtand, that the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Pardon is of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
efficacy to cleanſe a man from his offences, than if he ſhould bath in a Tub
of Holy Water every day i'the Year, and then receive Abſolution from ten
thouſand Lubberly <hi>Priests.</hi> Being then made <hi>good men</hi> by the high Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of the Kings Mercy, tho Fools and Knaves ſtill take the boldneſs to defame
them, they are Witneſſes legal, every way juſtifiable, and not to be diſputed
againſt by any good or loyal Subject of the King. And ſince they have ſworn
to a Plot wherein they were Actors themſelves, deſign'd to the deſtruction of
the King and Kingdom, the Nation is bound to believe 'em, notwithſtanding all
the frivolous clamour of the Lord <hi>Staffords Memoirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>From theſe and other the like Grounds,</hi> the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do infer, <hi>That there is no
credit to be given</hi> to the bare Suppoſitions of a <hi>Memoir-monger,</hi> ſcribling <hi>at ſuch
a wild</hi> and <hi>incoherent rate,</hi> and ſo ſcandalous to the King and the whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
And they further appeal to the Judgment of every impartial
conſcientious man whether it be not more likely that the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> a People ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
of debauch'd and murderous Principles, that bear no Conſciences
towards Hereticks, perſecuted by Penal Laws, allur'd by the recovery of their
Abby-Lands, encourag'd and ſupported by great Intereſt in the Kingdom,
<hi>ſhould be induc'd</hi> out of their hatred of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, and for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of their own, which is the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Intereſt, to remove the Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of their Happineſs by the deſtruction of a Heretick Prince, and all his
moſt Loyal Subjects, then that a few inconſiderable perſons, without any
ſupport or encouragement, ſhould dare to create ſuch a bloudy and horrid

ſuch a Plot to the face of King, Lords and Commons of <hi>England,</hi> had it bin
true, that ſo many <hi>Noble, Prudent, Loyal and Virtuous Perſons,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi>

            <p>In the next place he comes to <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letters, tho he make but a ſhort

forth a Confeſſion, but diſliking the Countenance of his <hi>Brat,</hi> he endeavours
to murder it again with a piece of ſordid Sophiſtry, ſo palpable and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that any one but an <hi>Impartial Papiſt</hi> would be aſham'd of it. He confeſſes
<hi>That thoſe Letters manifeſtly denote the buſie deſignes and activity of the Writers;</hi>

giving marks of their Friendſhip to Mr.—to make the great Deſign ſucceed, to
undermine the Intreagues of the Merchants, who Trade for the Parliament and the
Religion; and to Eſtabliſh that of the Aſſociated Catholicks in every Place.</hi> Here

being ſent into Germany. Here is <hi>deſigns,</hi> and <hi>aſſociated Catholicks,</hi> which

obſerve this Paſſage. <hi>The reports of a Biſhop for</hi> England <hi>are chimeras, that

of <hi>England</hi> were diſpoſed of at <hi>Rome,</hi> in hopes of what? of the ſucceſs of

up a new Prince, in every part of his Letters, which could not be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the removal of the preſent Poſſeſour; which is ſworn to have been the
intention of your Employers. By all which it appears that <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Plot,
and the Plot diſcovered by Dr. <hi>Otes</hi> are ſtill the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> the deſtruction of
the King, and the ſubverſion of his Government. And thus you ſee the Plot
which you would have ſo ſophiſtically divided, is again coagulated into one.
Nevertheleſs, by the way, let all the world take notice, that it was not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Knaviſhly done to cover <hi>Coleman's Treaſons</hi> with the tender Epithites, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
of <hi>buſie deſign</hi> and <hi>activity,</hi> but alſo wickedly done, to infer the innocency
of your Employers from ſo notorious a Falſehood. But, Sir, it fares with
you, as it does with many a deſtructive Fox, who being taken by the leg in a
Trap, is forced to bite off the hampered member to ſave the reſt of his Body.</p>
            <p>He proceeds next to the Murther of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey;</hi> to which he
puts all his ſtrength, as if he was heaving at a Capſtal; but with what ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs

               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:104686:10"/>
               <hi>There is nothing,</hi> ſays he, with an audacious arrogance, <hi>to faſten the
Death of Sir</hi> Edmundbury Godfrey <hi>upon the Roman Catholicks, but the bare im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable,
though gainful Oaths of two infamous perſons,</hi> Bedlow, <hi>notorious for
cheats and miſdemeanours; and</hi> Prance <hi>ſelf condemned of falſhood by the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his own-mouth.</hi> And thus you ſee ſtill the onely four Props of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi>
defence <hi>ſuppoſed improbability, ſcandal, defamation, and downright lying.</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
had Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi> had ever any reverence for the <hi>Lord Stafford's</hi> Memory,
he would never have ſtuft his <hi>Memoirs</hi> with ſuch gulleries and impoſtures.
As for <hi>Bedloe,</hi> he is ſince deceaſed, however he ſtood then, by the King's favour,
right in the eye of the Law, and therefore here needs no other anſwer than
what has been already given to this ſtale exception of Mr. <hi>Impartial.</hi> As for
Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> he, 'tis well known was a perſon never taxed for his life and
converſation, before he was drawn into that vile conſpiracy by the charms
of thoſe infamous (to return Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi> his own word again) and more
then wicked <hi>Popiſh Priects,</hi> who aſſur'd him, that horrid Fact was meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
both before God and man, and a deed of charity to do it. And being
freed from that Crime, by the King's mercy and his own cordial repentance,
he has made no other alteration in his former life and converſation, then in
abandoning that hateful Religion that ſeduc'd him to that misfortune. And
for the <hi>gain</hi> that he got by his Oath, he is ready to bequeath it all to Mr. <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial</hi>
for the kindneſs of his calumnies. There is yet another thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.
<hi>That he condemned himſelf of faſhood from his own mouth;</hi> in which Mr.
<hi>Impartial,</hi> boldly and very unmannerly gives the lye to the whole Court, who
upon the Plea of the Murtherers themſelves, abſolutely cleared him of that
aſperſion, But Mr. <hi>Impartial,</hi> in this, as in all other things, thinks to carry
the day by foul miſrepreſentation. <hi>He ſwore himſelf,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>an Actor in the
Murther, and afterward before the King and Council, unſwore what he had ſaid:</hi>
which is a poſitive falſhood, For that which Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi> calls unſwearing,
was only a bare denial, or rather a retracting in theſe general &amp; abrupt terms:
<hi>he was innocent, and they were all innocent.</hi> His Oath at large was ſolemnly
ſworn; the latter under conſternation and fear, in a diſtemper of body and
mind. He conſider'd the danger of his life after he had made his confeſſion, as
having no pardon. He fear'd the revenge of the bloudy <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuites</hi>
themſelves. He fear'd the loſs of his livelihood, which depended upon the
work which he had from the Queen. And theſe were the Circumſtances
which caus'd that ſudden revolt of his reaſon; and that general retractation,
which Mr. <hi>Impartial,</hi> according to his papiſtical gift calls a <hi>Proteſtation, That he
knew nothing of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But no ſooner had he overcome thoſe diſturbances of his mind, but he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
his firſt Impeachment upon Oath; and with repentance acknowledg'd
that his retractation was occaſion'd by conſternation and perplexity of mind:
of which he requeſted the Keeper of <hi>Newgate</hi> to give an immediate account
to the King and Council; who thereupon went accordingly, and declared
the ſame upon Oath; the Priſoner himſelf then falling deſparately ſick.</p>
            <p>Having thus endeavour'd to ſham the World with no leſs then three appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
fourberies, enter his old Friend Mr. <hi>Improbable,</hi> like Volpone in the Play.
<hi>Sir</hi> Ed. Godfrey, <hi>ſaith he, was esteem<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d a moderate man, and particularly indulgent
to the Papiſts; and 'tis not credible the Papiſts would murther their Friend.</hi> So
much their <hi>Friend,</hi> that when none of the Juſtices of the Peace would
meddle with Dr. <hi>Otes</hi>'s <hi>Depoſitions,</hi> he onely adventur'd to take 'em. After
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104686:11"/>
which he himſelf with his own mouth often declared, how he had bin conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
dogg'd by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> which caus'd within him ſtrange fears and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
of the danger he was in; inſomuch that he forebeaded of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that he, to uſe his own words, <hi>ſhould be the firſt Martyr.</hi> Alas! before
that time Sir <hi>Edmund</hi> might have walk'd the Streets at all hours of the night;
there was no body watch'd him, no body dogg'd him before; but no ſooner
had the <hi>Papiſts</hi> received the Alarum of the Diſcovery, and that Sir <hi>Edmond</hi>
had bin ſo bold as to perform the duty of his Office, and take the Depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but he could not ſtir a foot without a private Lacquey at his Heels; which
double diligence and care of his perſon never ceas'd till they had acted their
intended Tragedy. So then the reaſon that Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi> urges why the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
were not likely</hi> to commit this Murder, was the reaſon why they were moſt
likely to do it. For <hi>eſteeming him their friend,</hi> they took it heinou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly that their
friend ſhould be ſo unkind as to take Depoſitions againſt them, and dive ſo
narrowly into their Affairs.</p>
            <p>Next the <hi>Scene muſt be (forſooth) the Publick-Yard of</hi> Somerſet-Houſe, <hi>a
Thorough-fare of continual intercourſe,</hi> Setting aſide the force of that empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
word <hi>forſooth,</hi> this is all a Story. For <hi>Somerſet-houſe</hi> Yard, then inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by few or none but Prieſts and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> at that time of the Year, at that time
of night, after nine of the Clock, is well known to be no common Thorough-Fare.
But it was <hi>within twenty paces of the Common Guards where Watch is kept
night and day.</hi> How notably he has dropt in the word <hi>is</hi> (for he would fain
be thought to tell truth but then there were no Common Guards, no Watch
day or night, but only a File or two of Souldiers in reſpect to the Kings Palace,
that never watch'd at that time but only at the great Portal, and they well
employ'd by the Murtherers with Drink and Tobacco; and this is the Truth.
Now where would Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi> have had the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have Murder'd Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondbury
Godfrey,</hi> but in a place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wholly at their Devotion? <hi>Then</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to
feign a Quarrel, to call Sir</hi> Edmond <hi>out of the Street<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet that neither Paſſengers,
Souldiers nor Neighbours ſhould obſerve any thing of the Tumult,</hi> and this he calls,
ironically, a <hi>Notable Policy.</hi> Oh Sir, 'twas a loving Quarrel, a ſilent Quarrel,
a trapa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>ing Quarrel, there was no noiſe or tumult for Paſſengers to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, or for inviſible <hi>neighbours</hi> or Souldiers to hear; an amicable Quarrel
to inveigle Sir <hi>Edmond</hi> not ſo much to appeaſe that Quarrel, but to prevent
a further pretended miſchief. And ſo, Sir, it was a <hi>Notable Policy,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſo well ſucceeding, and ſuch a one that a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prieſt for all his high-flown
Parts, might not be aſham'd to own.</p>
            <p>But then, <hi>They ſtrangled him with a Handkerchief, a very proper inſtrument,
ſtudied and contrived before hand to strangle a man.</hi> You ſhould have put in
<hi>long</hi> Sir, for ſo 'tis in the Original. I confeſs. I know not what experience
in ſtrangling or hanging Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi> may have, for he aſſumes to himſelf
to be a great Iudge, and yet if he will not believe a <hi>long Handkerchief</hi> to be
a proper inſtrument for the buſineſs, he may, when he pleaſes, try the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
upon himſelf.</p>
            <p>But then <hi>after the buſineſs was done, they let him lye expos'd in this open place.</hi>
And thus the World may ſee how the concatenation of this fallacious Mr. <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial</hi>'s
Impoſture depends upon meer ſtorys of his own framing. <hi>He has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
the murdered Carcaſs, he his expos'd it in an open place.</hi> The Prieſts were no
ſuch fools. They had done their work in a by Corner, they had ſet
one to watch at one Gate, another to watch another; and the Street at
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104686:11"/>
the ſame time empty. How was this expoſing him? 'Tis a thouſand pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys
Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi> had not bin there, that he might have given a truer and bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
account of the paſſages.</p>
            <p>This is the ſtrangeſt way to vindicate a deteſtable Murther that ever was-known;
with Whims and Conceits and Imaginations of things done as he
would have had 'em done, to contradict one that was perſonally preſent,
and ſaw all the Tranſactions! Here is one ſwears he ſaw the Murder com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
where, when, how, and by whom, tells ye the memorable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of thumping his breaſt, wringing his neck, an intention of running
him through with a Sword, and the reaſon why 'twas not done, leſt his bloud
ſhould betray the Murther, and that memorable exultation of <hi>Girald</hi> the
Prieſt over his body: <hi>Well if we could not have entir'd him here, I reſolv'd to have
dogged him to his own Houſe, and there would have run him through with my own
hand.</hi> And yet after all this, here comes a <hi>Nicodemus</hi> of a <hi>Skeptic,</hi> and framing
abſurdities and improbabilities of his own, asks how this could be done, or
how this is poſſible? 'tis very true, had they done, as he pretends they did,
they had bin the greateſt Coxcombs in the World; but they knew better
how to do their work. And then again, <hi>is it likely the</hi> Papiſts <hi>ſhould murder
their friend?</hi> why no: for had he bin their friend, 'tis very probable they would
not have murder'd him, but not being their Friend, or rather their great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
they did. Certainly the Devil ow'd the <hi>Papists</hi> a ſhame to ſet ſuch a
<hi>Memoir-Man</hi> as this at work.</p>
            <p>In the next place, he is ſetting the Witneſſes at odds, to ſee if he can find
his dearly beloved friend Mr. <hi>Perjury</hi> among 'em. <hi>Bedlow</hi> ſays he, <hi>depoſes.</hi>
Sir Edmund <hi>was throttl'd with a Cravatt.</hi> Prance <hi>ſwears it was a Handkerchief.</hi>
Oh, I have hit the <hi>Scotiſm</hi> of the buſineſs. Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi> would have had it
ſpruce Crauat, a faſhionable Cravat, a Cravat according to the proper ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
of the word (would you have had it lac'd or plain Sir?) for then
indeed there might have bin ſome glimpſe of a Perjury, in calling a Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
a Cravat. But do but forgive Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> this <hi>peccadillo,</hi> and you ſhall
have the liberty to call any thing of Linnen that a man may wear about his
neck, tho it be a ſheet, either <hi>Cravat or Hankerchief,</hi> which you pleaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Names of the Aſſaſſinates cited by</hi> Bedlow <hi>are</hi> La Phaire, Pritchard, Wells
<hi>and others. But the Murderers nam'd by</hi> Prance <hi>were</hi> Green, Hill, Bury, Girald
<hi>and</hi> Kelly. <hi>Bedlow</hi> nam'd none for Aſſaſſinates, and therefore that's ſome of
your own Coin. He ſwears indeed that <hi>La Phair</hi> would have had him have
done the buſineſs, and proffer'd him Money to do it; but the buſineſs was not
done by that Gang. For you muſt underſtand, Mr. <hi>Impartial,</hi> that there were
two Parties (ſo eager were the <hi>Papists</hi> to deſtroy that poor Gentleman, their
Friend) <hi>Bedlow</hi>'s Party, and <hi>Prance's</hi> Party. Now it ſo fell out, that <hi>Prance</hi>'s
Party were too yare for <hi>Bedlows,</hi> and had diſpatch'd their buſineſs, while <hi>La
Phaire</hi> went hawking about with his great rewards for a Chapman. But
when the buſineſs was done, both Parties joyn'd and rejoyc'd together. Now
<hi>Bedlow</hi> ſwearing that his Party were privy to the Concealment, and intended
the ſame thing, and <hi>Prance</hi> ſwearing that his Party committed the Fact,
where could be a more harmonious Concordance of two Oaths for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment
of a wicked Murther? <hi>The Murther was ſaid to be committed the
12th. of</hi> October 78. <hi>at nine at night, and the Body convey'd away the</hi> Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
<hi>following at Midnight.</hi> In oppoſition to this, he brings the long ago over-rul'd
atteſtations of Mrs. <hi>Tilden</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Broadstreet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> The ſum of whoſe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104686:12"/>
was, <hi>That</hi> Hill <hi>had bin a Trusty Servant, that he never kept ill hours,
but always came in by eight of the Clock: that he could not go out afterwards, becauſe
the Doors were lock'd up; and that they were conſtantly up till eleven a clock at night.
That the Room where the body was ſaid to be laid, was not only over againſt the Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Rome, but that the Key was always in the Door, and that every day they went into
it for ſomething or other, and that there was but one Key to the Door.</hi> But Mr.
<hi>Impartial</hi> omits how fatally Mrs. <hi>Tilden</hi> trip'd in her Story, when ſhe affirm'd
that the Family had never bin out of their Lodging ſince they came to Town,
and being ask'd when they were out of Town, ſhe reply'd <hi>in October.</hi> Upon
which the Court told her, <hi>She had ſpoyl'd all, and had undone the Man inſtead
of ſaving him.</hi> With that ſhe would have recanted, and ſaid, <hi>Why, my Lord,
I only miſtook the Month.</hi> By which, Mr. <hi>Impartial,</hi> it was apparent, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
her Devotion had ſtupify'd her Conſideration, or that ſhe appear'd in
Court only to ſay what would ſerve the turn, as having bin leſſen'd at your
<hi>Swearing-School.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for Mrs. <hi>Broad-Streets</hi> Evidence, it was delivered with more confidence
than became her Sex. For after ſhe had deny'd that there were more than
one Key to the Lodgings, ſhe confeſs'd before the <hi>Duke of Monmouth,</hi> after
Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> had clearly made it out to her face, that there were ſix or ſeven.
And in the Queſtion about <hi>Hills</hi> leaving the <hi>Doctors</hi> Lodgings, ſhe had ſo
hamper'd her ſelf, by ſaying and unſaying, ſaying one thing, and ſetting her
hand to another, but more eſpecially by her ſtout averments that the Key
was always in <hi>Hill</hi>'s Door, that the Court told her, <hi>'Twas very ſuſpicious, if
ſhe went ſo conſtantly in and out, that ſhe muſt either hear when the</hi> Body <hi>was brought
in, or ſee it while it was there;</hi> and further added, <hi>That 'twas well ſhe was not
indicted.</hi> And thus you ſee what excellent Witneſſes you have brought to
prove contradiction, and this after a Sentence pronounc'd by Judges as wiſe
as your ſelf or any of your Employers. As for the Sentinels that you ſay
<hi>kept ſtrict Guard at the great Gate,</hi> there was but one could be thought to
ſpeak to the purpoſe. And as for him, to give you plenary Satisfaction,
there was ſtrict Order taken with him, that tho he might ſee the Sedan car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
in, he was better employ'd than to ſee it go out.</p>
            <p>And now what may the World think of ſuch a ſhammoking Vindicator,
that having taken upon him to vindicate Murder and Treaſon in the higheſt
degree, and the innocence of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> under ſuch a bloudy Charge of <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Plot,</hi> and <hi>Helliſh Treachery,</hi> and following others, as if he had out-done and
ſurpaſs'd all others that went before him, can find no other way to throw
Defamation and Perjury upon the Kings Evidence, and to invalidate their
Teſtimonies againſt a horrid and prodigious Murder, than by making uſe of
the openly trapp'd and as openly rejected Atteſtations of Female <hi>Papiſts,</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born'd
by their own Bigotiſme, and ready to ſwear any thing to ſave their
<hi>Popiſh</hi> friend (an Infamy and Perjury as bad as can be Recorded in any Court
of Juſtice) I ſay, what may the World think of ſuch a ſhammoking Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
as this, but that he would never have ſtuck to commit the ſame inhuman
act himſelf: for he that will ſo openly and ſo zealouſly defend a Murder,
will never ſcruple to commit one. And yet after all this, he is ſo far from
having anſwer'd expectation, that he has not done ſo much as others of his
fellow Penmen. However he has empty'd his Quiver for this bout, and ſhot
all the darts of his Malice againſt the face of Juſtice, thinking to have all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
her lovely Countenance, but that it proves impenetrable to the yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104686:12"/>
weapons of ſuch a feeble Aſſaſſinate. Certainly 'tis an impudence beyond
impudence it ſelf, to throw <hi>Infamy</hi> and <hi>Defamation</hi> in the faces of Witneſſes,
and bring nothing but a Tinkers Fardel of Lyes and Forgeries to diſprove
their Teſtimony. And as certainly it muſt be a very bad cauſe that has no
ſupport but the meer invalidation of the Evidence againſt it; but a worſe,
that after ſo much ineffectual toyl and cunning, cannot be able to vanquiſh
the Evidence of 3 or 4 ordinary perſons, when their Perjuries are ſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
and the ſtreſs of Criminals Innocence depends ſo much upon it.</p>
            <p>Now to ſhew you, Sir, what credit is to be given to <hi>Popiſh</hi> Witneſſes when
they come to ſwear in a <hi>Heretical</hi> Court, eſpecially in Points that nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
themſelves, I will give you now ſignal Preſidents, not of <hi>Madam Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinents,</hi>
or Mrs. <hi>Confidences,</hi> but of the Fathers of your Church, holy, pious, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Men, Saints by this time. The one in the cauſe of <hi>Newnam</hi> Abby then in
<hi>Chancery, Martin</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> Truſtee Plaintiff, and <hi>Savage</hi> Defendant, about the
Year, 1671. Wherein thoſe <hi>Reverend Fathers, Whitebread, Harcourt</hi> and
<hi>Charles Poulton</hi> now Provincial of the <hi>Engliſh Jeſuites</hi> came in as Witneſſes
in their own Cauſe, and under aſſumed Names and Diſguiſes, very briskly
ſwore for themſelves. And no longer ſince then in <hi>December</hi> laſt, the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Father Barton,</hi> a <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> took a Journey from <hi>Leige</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> and
ſwore under the borrowed name and perſon of—<hi>Colborn</hi> for the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> in
another cauſe now depending alſo between the King and the <hi>Jeſuites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay more than this, the time was here at <hi>London,</hi> and that not long
ago, when ſome of your Employers kept a <hi>Swearing-School,</hi> and a <hi>Perjury-Maſter,</hi>
at what time the St. <hi>Omers</hi> Youths were taught and leſſon'd to damn
their ſouls at the laſt Tryals of <hi>Langhorn</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> the effects of which
appear'd in open Court, to the ſhame and deriſion of their Inſtructor. And it
may be very probably from hence preſumed, that they who had one, have
many more of the ſame kind, or that they will not ſcruple to erect 'em when
they have occaſion. So that 'tis the Opinion of moſt men, that it had bin
much more honourable and advantagious to the <hi>Popiſh Religion,</hi> for that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Gentleman to have kept a Vaulting School. And yet the Diſcoverers of
your Villanies muſt be rogu'd and raskall'd with Perjuries of all ſorts by
<hi>Perjury-Doctors</hi> and <hi>Perjury-Abettors, Traytors, Plotters</hi> and <hi>Aſſaſſinates,</hi> ten
times worſe than ever they were, when at the worſt. Here Mr. <hi>Impartial,</hi>
for ought I find, no better than the reſt, to vindicate the <hi>Papiſts</hi> from a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
the moſt barbarous that was ever committed, has brought a company
of Flams and Stories, <hi>how can it be's, and how is it poſſible's?</hi> and ſuch kind of
plauſible riffraff; he ſhould do well to have taken Mr. <hi>Prance</hi>'s Narrative in
his hand, and to have ſpent his Lamp and his Labour in confuting the conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenated
Circumſtances of the Murder, which I will defie ever a <hi>Jeſuite</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to contrive with ſuch a face of probability had they not bin true. Which
becauſe Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi> has not done, to find him work for new <hi>Memoirs,</hi> and
to quicken the Memory of the Nation, I will ſet them down with as much
brevity as I can, and then let the World judge between his Shams and the
reality of the Murder committed by the <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Charge is, That the barbarous Murther of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi> was
committed by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> Prov'd by the Oath of Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> who was an
Actor in the whole Contrivance, and relates the matter briefly thus. He tells
ye firſt the reaſons that engag'd the Conſpirators to deſign the Murther.</p>
            <p>Becauſe he was a buſie man, and was going about to ruine all the <hi>Catholicks</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> and that it was neceſſary to deſtroy him, elſe they were all undone.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104686:13"/>
For he had examin'd people againſt them, and had got Depoſitions to fix odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Crimes and Scandals upon them and their Religion.</p>
            <p>Next the motives that induc'd him into the Conſpiracy. <hi>Girald</hi> told him,
it would be a piece of good ſervice to the Church; that it was no ſin, but a
work of charity; that it was no murther, but for the good of the Church,
and the glory of God, and therefore he ought to do it.</p>
            <p>The murther being agreed on, he comes to the manner. That about Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday
the twelfth of <hi>October, Green, Hill,</hi> and <hi>Gerald</hi> dogg'd him from his firſt
going out, all the reſt of the day till about ſix or ſeven at night, at what time
they fixed him in a Houſe in S. <hi>Clements.</hi> That then <hi>Green</hi> came to him, and
miſſing him at home found him at a pub<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ck Houſe, and bid him haſten down to
<hi>Somerſet</hi>-yard; which he did, and there found <hi>Berry</hi> and <hi>Kelly</hi> together,
where they continu'd, till <hi>Hill</hi> came running to them, and told them Sir <hi>Ed.</hi>
was coming. Upon which they prepar'd for their Work. In order to which
<hi>Kelly</hi> and <hi>Berry</hi> pretended a quarrell, while <hi>Hill,</hi> who was well-known to Sir
<hi>Ed.</hi> watch'd for him at the Gate to drill him in. That Sir <hi>Edmund<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> at firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd,
but at length was overperſwaded, and went in. That thereupon <hi>Hill</hi>
enter'd firſt, Sir <hi>Ed.</hi> next, and behind him <hi>Girald</hi> and <hi>Green.</hi> That being now
ſure of him, <hi>Prance</hi> went to watch the <hi>Water-Gate,</hi> and <hi>Berry</hi> to watch the
paſſage up the ſtone-ſtairs. That as Sir <hi>Ed.</hi> was going toward the pretended
Quarrellers, <hi>Berry, Kelly</hi> and <hi>Green</hi> threw a long twiſted Handkerchief about
his Neck; and then immediately <hi>Girald, Kelly, Green</hi> and <hi>Hill</hi> fell upon
him, threw him down and throttled him; and drawing him behind the Rail,
gave him ſeveral punches upon the Breaſt with their Knees. That after all
this, fearing he was not yet quite dead, <hi>Girald</hi> would have run his Sword
through him but was not permitted, leſt they ſhould be diſcover'd by the
Bloud; however that <hi>Green,</hi> to make ſure, wrung his Neck round.</p>
            <p>Next as to the diſpoſal of his perſon, the <hi>Relator</hi> tells ye, that they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
the Body in at the door right againſt the place where he was murthered,
and ſo up ſuch a pair of ſtairs, into ſuch an entry, into ſuch a Lodging, where
<hi>Hill</hi> was concern'd, and opened the door; then up five or ſix ſteps into a
little Room on the right hand, where they ſet the Body with his Head lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt a Bed. That the Body lay there till Monday-night, and was then
remov'd into another Room, for fear notice ſhould be taken of keeping the
other ſo long private. That on Tueſday at Night they would have remov'd
him back to <hi>Hill</hi>'s Chamber; but he going before, and finding ſome Body
there, they were forc'd to carry it to another Room on the left hand. From
thence about nine a Clock on Wedneſday night they remov'd it again to <hi>Hill</hi>'s
Lodging, by a memorable token, that <hi>Prance</hi> coming that way, and they not
knowing who it might be, they left the Body, and began to run away, till
<hi>Prance</hi> calling to them, and they knowing his voice came back, all but <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
who run quite to his Lodg. That there they conſulted the carrying him
into the Fields, and laying him in the poſture he was found, which was done
in a <hi>Sedan.</hi> That <hi>Berry</hi> open'd the Gate upon a <hi>humm;</hi> having before invited
the Souldiers into his Lodg with Drink and Tobacco.<note place="bottom">☞ To all Perſons of true Integrity, whether this were not a holy cheat beyond guilding of ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings? The one is but a breach of a ſingle Statute, the other perverts the whole courſe of Juſtice, and ſcoffs at the whole Law of the Land. Yet theſe, and their Defenders, are they that would defame and perjure the Kings Evidence, that will not allow the King the Prerogative of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Theſe are They that exclaim'd againſt the ill Life and Converſation of Dr. <hi>Otes;</hi> who if he were at any time guilty of thoſe things wherewith they taxed him; we know now from whence he learnt 'em.</note> That <hi>Gerald</hi> and <hi>Prance</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:104686:13"/>
carried him to the end of S. <hi>James's Street:</hi> Then <hi>Kelly</hi> and <hi>Green</hi> took him
up, and carri'd him through <hi>King-street,</hi> and <hi>Roſe-ſtreet</hi> to <hi>Long-Acre</hi>-end.
That then the two firſt carri'd him as far as the <hi>Grecian Church,</hi> where they
met a Horſe. That there they ſet him upon the Horſe, <hi>by this Token,</hi> that when
he was mounted, <hi>Gerald</hi> uttered theſe Words, <hi>I wiſh we had a hundred ſuch
Rogues as ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cure as this.</hi> Then <hi>Hill, Gerald, Kelly and Green</hi> went away with
the Body, one leading the Horſe, two walking by, one on each ſide, whilſt
<hi>Hill</hi> held him on before.</p>
            <p>There are alſo ſeveral material Poſt-circumſtances; That upon the News
of the Body being found, one <hi>Vernatti,</hi> who ſhould have been concerned in the
murder, but was abſent, being at the Tavern with Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>Lord!
is this mans Body found already, that was carried away but yeſternight!</hi> That <hi>Girald</hi>
gave an exact account in writing to the ſaid <hi>Vernatti,</hi> who read the ſame to
one <hi>Leneſon</hi> a Prieſt, that ſhould alſo have been concern'd in it, but miſs'd, at
the <hi>George</hi> near the <hi>Stocks-Market.</hi> Afterwards at one <hi>Cuſne's</hi> at <hi>Bow</hi> to one
<hi>Dethick</hi> that liv'd not above a mile from the place, and was ſent for to rejoyce
for the bleſſed news over a Barrel of Oyſters, and a Diſh of Fiſh.</p>
            <p>Thus Mr. <hi>Impartial,</hi> I have lighted a Candle to your dark objections. And
now, Sir, how do you like the Story? Do you not want a Cordial to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
your ſinking ſpirits? Does not the ghaſtly apparation of ſuch fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Circumſtances ſtrike a terrour to your ſouls? Could any but a Papiſt,
the Friend of Maſſacre, believe, that ſo many Circumſtances of Perſons,
manner, time, place, and words, beſides by tokens, all cohering together,
yet all the acts of ſeveral days, be ſo readily contriv'd by a poor man in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
under conſternation diſmai'd, diſtemper'd, to be as readily, and ſo
particularly deliver'd in a verbal confeſſion, before ſo aweful an Aſſembly as
the King of Three Kingdoms, and His Great Council, had not Truth ſolely
taken upon her the conduct of his utterance. Truth that needs not none of
your Frame-work-weaving, Mr. <hi>Impartial,</hi> to cover over the ſtains of Bloud
ſo unhumanely ſhed with old objections, and ſtudi'd abſurdities new trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and furbiſh'd. After all this, Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> was punctual, direct and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
as to all the places where the murther was committed, and where the
Body was conveigh'd, at what time the D. of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Oſſory,</hi>
and Sir <hi>Robert Southwel</hi> were order'd to take a particular accompt from him
upon the place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therefore Mr. <hi>Impartial,</hi> your beſt way would have
been to have ſpar'd theſe loud cries of <hi>Nonſence</hi> and <hi>Abſurditie;</hi> and to have
true <hi>Champion like,</hi> outdar'd, outboun'd, outbrav'd, outfac'd the world,
that there never was any ſuch perſon as Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> upon the face
of the Earth; and that he never was, or ever ſhall be born. Then your <hi>St
George-ſhip</hi> had ſlain the Dragon with a vengeance. Where are old <hi>Ireland</hi>'s
Proteſtations, Imprecations, and bold ſummonings of God to witneſs the
innocence of the Papiſts? Had yee no more powerful charms than theſe to
conjure down the walking Ghoſt that ſo torments your quiet; Here's a
murther ſuffocated indeed by a Crown of a Hero!—which the dexterity
of a deluded Virgin would have done more artificially. For ſtill, by ſilly juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
it appears far fowler than ever. All the Waſhball Proteſtations of
ſuffering Malefactors, whether perſons of meaner rank, or <hi>Lords,</hi> cannot
waſh off this bloudy ſtain; mauger all your ſuborn'd <hi>Mograffs,</hi> and other
deep-laid Contrivances;—then let it lye on—and it will, as long as
Hiſtory can utter to the world the Story of this Age. Certainly, Villany and
Impudence were never ſo unluckily coupled ſince the Creation. Villany to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104686:14"/>
commit, impudence to juſtifie the moſt prodigious of Crimes. But ſo Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
order'd it, That this unfortunate Gentleman ſhould fall by the bloudy
hands of thoſe that ſeek the Nations ruine, to awaken the drowſie Kingdom,
whenever it ſhould grow careleſs of its ſafety. How much then does it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
all <hi>True Proteſtants</hi> to be careful and vigilant, when they ſee the Papiſts
ſo ſedulous to exerciſe into perpetual oblivion the murther of that Perſon,
whoſe Body Heaven permitted them to ſacrifice, that ſo his Soul might be,
as it were, one of the Guardian Angels of their Safety and Religion.</p>
            <p>In the next place he endeavours to complement the <hi>Two</hi> Houſes of <hi>Parliament</hi>
out of their Honour, their juſtice, their reaſon, their underſtanding, their pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and all that advances the Luſtre, the Grandeur, and the high Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
due to the moſt Aweful, and moſt Renowned Aſſembly under Heaven;
telling them with a fawning—ſnarle, <hi>(with all due ſubmiſſion to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in defence of the Innocent) That it is not impoſſible, nor altogether without
Preſident, That a lawful Authority proceeding</hi> ſecundum Allegata &amp; probata
<hi>ſhould be abuſed; and conſequently drawn into a mistake by the malice and perjury of
wicked men.</hi> How meanly, how lowly, does this <hi>Muſhrom</hi> of a <hi>Memoir-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi>
after his ſneering complement, think of the Lords and Commons of
<hi>England?</hi> That which good manners would not impoſe upon an ordinary
Seſſions of Oyer and Terminer, he moſt audaciouſly throws upon the <hi>Two
Houſes of Parliament;</hi> weakneſs and miſtake, and to be cajoll'd by the <hi>malice
and perjury of wicked men.</hi> After ſo many daily Debates and Conſultations;
after ſo many ſiftings and ſcannings of charge and proof the high wiſdom and
prudence of the Two Houſes of Parliament was led away by weakneſs and
miſtake to give credit to the <hi>malice and perjury</hi> of three or four inconſiderable,
<hi>malicious and wicked men;</hi> and ſo to proceed to the effuſion of innocent Bloud.
What is this, but to charge the Two Houſes of Parliament, either with folly,
or impiety the moſt egregious in the world? An indignity for the Nation not
to endure. There is no queſtion to be made, but that Mr. <hi>Impartial's allegata
&amp; probata,</hi> all his <hi>Probables</hi> and <hi>Improbables,</hi> all his <hi>contradictions</hi> and <hi>abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
were duly way'd and ponder'd with all the thoughtful diligence and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity,
that juſtice and conſcience could invent. Which not being to be
call'd into doubt, there is no reaſon in the world for the Nation to believe
that ſo much juſtice, ſo much conſcience, ſo much elaborate prudence could
err. The truth of which he himſelf confirms, while he brings an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to undermine their Reputation, by ſaying, <hi>All have not been convicted
who were impeached and try'd at the Bar; but as ſome have been condemned, ſo others
have been acquitted.</hi> Which apparently ſhew'd the equality and impartiality
of their Proceedings, and that they were not in queſt of innocent Bloud, but
onely ſought the deſerved puniſhment of thoſe that were guilty. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for ſuch a Flyblow of a pretended Proteſtant to go about to taint the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and juſtice of the Two Houſes of Parliament, whom he confeſſes ſo
fair in their Proceedings, was an unparallel'd piece of arrogance, then which
nothing more confirms the truth of the Plot, and the Crimes of his Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
So that he might have reſerv'd his crafty Cringes, and his <hi>Preſidents</hi>
for ſome High German Senate of <hi>Mum brewers</hi> in the Land of <hi>Brandenbourgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, to excuſe <hi>tho Inſtances given of Popiſh Malice, and Bloudineſs from
the Examples of Q.</hi> Maries <hi>Cruelties, the Iriſh Barbariſm, the French Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre,
&amp;c.</hi> he recriminates upon the Proteſtants in <hi>Germany, France, Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi>
and <hi>Holland.</hi> But that is not the Point; for there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a Maſſacre, or a Perſecution, and a War, though it be a Rebellion;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104686:14"/>
wherein there are preceeding expoſtulations, ſomething of a ſeeming <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
pretended claim or grievance; but in Maſſacre or Perſecution there is nothing
but propenſe Villany and impiety. Had the <hi>Christians</hi> bin in Arms againſt their
Emperors, they could not have bin call'd Perſecutions, and the <hi>Christians</hi> had
bin in the wrong; but as they were Perſecutions, we find how infamous they
have render'd thoſe Emperors. Rebellions are headed by Perſons of high
Quality, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> by the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> a free Prince of the Empire,
that in <hi>France</hi> by the <hi>Coligny</hi>'s, and conſequently reduc'd into a formal Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
Maſſacres are only tumultuary Riots and Surpriſes of the Innocent. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
pretends a ſeeming Provocation, but Maſſacre deſtroys without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of Sex or Age, thoſe that dream'd no harm. So that nothing can
be more foul, more wicked, more malicious, more ſpiteful, more inhuman,
more faithleſs, treacherous and deſtructive to the bonds of Human Society.
And this is the Charge we lay upon the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> beſides that of Rebellion. For
if we ſhould muſter up the Rebellions of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> againſt their Princes, they
are innumerable, and frequently authoriz'd by the Pope himſelf.</p>
            <p>As for that ſame execrable Murder of the Late King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, of
Bleſſed Memory, as it was never committed, ſo it was never own'd, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
condemn'd and abominated by all the true Profeſſors of the <hi>Protistant</hi>
Religion. It was the nefarious Act of a nefarious Uſurper, who having at
his Devotion an Army, which he had long headed with a ſucceſsful and dare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Conduct, took the opportunity, when the Nation was quite try'd out with
an inteſtine War of near Twenty Years ſtanding, as it were to conquer the
whole Kingdom, to ſeize and murder his diſtreſſed Sovereign, and inſtead of
a King to make himſelf a Tyrant. All this the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> lamented and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed,
while the Tyrant, having like <hi>Otho</hi> and <hi>Vitellius</hi> unjuſtly invaded the
Imperial Dignity, environ'd with and engadg'd and well pay'd Hodge-podge
of <hi>Veteran Levellers, Fiftmhonarchy-men</hi> an ſuch like <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> (not worth
the name of <hi>Proteſtants)</hi> and ador'd only by thoſe that ſought more the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of their unlawful Purchaſes, then the good of the Kingdom, trampled
not only over all true Religion, but Morality.</p>
            <p>But ſhould we number up the Murder of Kings committed by <hi>Papiſts,</hi> we
ſhould find more then one. <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d. and <hi>Edward</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d. were both De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
and Murder'd by their <hi>Popiſh</hi> Subjects. <hi>Henry</hi> the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d. <hi>Henry</hi> the
4th. of <hi>France</hi> were both murder'd by the Contrivance of their <hi>Popiſh</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and openly juſtify'd by the Prieſts of that time; nay the Murder of
the one was applauded even by the Pope himſelf in a Publick Harangue.
What does your Worſhip think of the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, who was
by a <hi>Predicant Frier</hi> of the Order of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> murder'd with a piece of the
<hi>Euchariſt</hi> ſop'd in Poyſon? By which the Monk evinc'd two things, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Religion, and the folly of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> as if the <hi>Real
Body of Chriſt</hi> could be capable of ſuch a damnable Infection.</p>
            <p>The Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> the Second was Excommunicated by <hi>Gregory</hi> IX.
with that Impudence that the Cardinals themſelves were aſham'd of it,
and expreſs'd their diſlike; and tho that Pope dy'd, yet the <hi>Papal</hi> fewd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd,
ſo that at length the Emperor was depos'd at the Inſtance of <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi>
the Fourth. Hiſtory affords plenty of Examples to this purpoſe, but
theſe may ſuffice for the preſent. After all which, Mr. <hi>Impartial,</hi> I muſt be
bold to tell you, that notwithſtanding all your nonſenſical <hi>improbables</hi> and <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities</hi>
you have endeavour'd to defend the <hi>innocent,</hi> like a fool to your
friends, and to aſperſe and calumnize the Kings Evidence, like a Knave and
Betrayer of the Religion you profeſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:104686:15"/>
Having gone thus far, we might well here make a Concluſion, in regard
that all that follows is a meer precarious <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uddle of Impertinences, built upon
a ſandy Foundation. For the Certainty of the Late Horrid Plot being ſtill
unſhaken, and the Legality and Credit of the Witneſſes undeniable, there
needs no further Argument to evince the Lord <hi>Staffords</hi> guilt, and the Juſtice
of his Condemnation, for that the one could not be juſt unleſs the other were
true, nor the other true unleſs the other were juſt. By which means, Mr.
<hi>Impartial</hi> hath brought himſelf into this Nooſe, that either he is in the right,
and the embody'd Juſtice and Prudence of the Nation were in the wrong, or
that the embody'd Juſtice and Prudence of the Nation are in the right, and
then he deſerves to ſuffer ſeverely for his boldneſs. However, becauſe there
ſtill remains behind ſome daſhes of his malice continu'd upon the Witneſſes,
and ſome ſprinklings of his Venome yet remaining, with which he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to bedew the unſpotted Reputation of thoſe highly learned and moſt
worthy Gentlemen that manag'd the Tryal, the purſuit of his lame Story
engages me to make ſome Remarks upon the moſt encroaching and plauſible
Paſſages of his arrogant Raillery. For the whole <hi>Plot</hi> and <hi>Deſign</hi> of his <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus-like</hi>
Pate, is rather to ridicule and puzzle than evince the Truth.</p>
            <p>To leave the reſt then, to mind their own Affairs, he aſſailes the Dr. the
chief Eye-ſore of his <hi>Papiſtical</hi> Tribe, with his old, ruſty Weapons of <hi>Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
Perjury</hi> and <hi>Contradiction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt then, by way of premiſing, let me put this Queſtion to the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
why Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi> ſhould preſume to put a greater value upon the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
produc'd on the behalf of the Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> than the Witneſſes that
gave Evidence againſt him. Since Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi> can never prove that ever the
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> kept a <hi>Swearing-School,</hi> under the quaint inſtructions of a <hi>Perjury-Maſter,</hi>
as he and his Gang did. In which 'tis ſhrewdly ſuſpected that there
might be many more Diſciples brought up than the Youths of St. <hi>Omers:</hi>
of whoſe induſtrious Education I would refer my ſelf, were it proper, to the
Judges themſelves that ſat upon the Tryals. Nay, was it not very pretty,
that the Maſter himſelf ſhould be preſent too, to hear how well his Pupils
had profited under his Inſtructions? Of how little value Oaths and Perjury
are among the <hi>Papiſts</hi> is well known. Nay we find in that undoubted Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> the Pope commanding the Emperor to perjure
himſelf, and break his Oath ſworn to the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> tho for the
Publick Repoſe of that vaſt Continent. So then if <hi>Popiſh</hi> Princes may Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
themſelves for the Popes pleaſure, dare the meaner Rabble refuſe to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
themſelves when their Prieſts ſhall hold it neceſſary? And thus the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi>
having invalidated the credit of their own Teſtimony, by that unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
cuſtom of keeping <hi>Swearing Schools;</hi> there is as much reaſon to believe
that the Lord <hi>Staffords</hi> Witneſſes were forſworn as Dr. <hi>Oates.</hi> Nay far more;
for they were not only not believ'd, but frequently were found out, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
with ignominy; Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> always <hi>ſtill</hi> ſteady to the Truth, always
gain'd Credit to his Teſtimony. So then all true <hi>Proteſtants</hi> being to take
notice, that there is little credit to be given to the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Witneſſes, who
may perjure themſelves to day, and be Abſolv'd to morrow, and that their
own Repreſentatives have given great Credit to Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> we ſhall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the Reflections themſelves, obſerving this by the way, That 'twas
the Perjury of <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> in obedience to a clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Pope, that loſt him the Battel of <hi>Varna,</hi> and extended the Dominion of
the <hi>Turk,</hi> almoſt to the Walls of <hi>Vienna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:104686:15"/>
In the firſt place Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi> wonders <hi>That the Prieſts had no more plauſible
or leſs dangerous Argument to convert a</hi> Proteſtant <hi>Miniſter, than by telling him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the Church of</hi> England <hi>was upon its last legs,</hi> from whence he infers, <hi>That ſurely
they took the Dr. for ſome notorious Fool or Knave.</hi> It may be they might,
what then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Knaves</hi> are no ſuch contemptible Inſtruments to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
on a Plot. The one may be impos'd upon, the other wrought upon. A
bigottiz'd <hi>Popiſh Fool</hi> may become Fool hardy, and then he is fit for any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief;
and for a <hi>Knave,</hi> you cannot, Mr. <hi>Impartial,</hi> but know your ſelf what
uſe may be made of ſuch a one. But ſuppoſe they thought him a very honeſt
Man, and that out of that confidence, they did open their hearts to him a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;
nay I will put ye one ſuppoſition more, ſuppoſe they had taken a Cup
of the Creature, 'twas no ſuch Miracle to tempt a Young Man with the
hopes of Preferment. All this while, theſe are only Suppoſitions; now that
you ſhould extract Perjury from the ſuppoſitions of your own Brain, is a
ſtrange piece of Chymiſtry.</p>
            <p>Your next wonder is, that the <hi>(Sotiſh Careleſs) Jeſuites, ſhould truſt a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophite
with all their moſt damnable Intreagues, as the adventures of</hi> Pickerings
<hi>Flint, Whipping, Thirty thouſand Maſſes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the manner of Firing the City,
and introducing Chymerical Armies, French, Iriſh, Spaniſh, &amp;c.</hi> Truly, Mr. <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial,</hi>
you are in a very pleaſant humor, though I'm afraid, You laugh but a
one ſide of your mouth. But now ſuppoſe they did; ſuppoſe thoſe <hi>ſotiſh, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Jeſuites</hi> did truſt this <hi>Neophyte,</hi> how can you help it? you muſt blame
the <hi>ſottiſh, careleſs Jeſuites,</hi> not him. And yet he was no ſuch <hi>Neophyte</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they had try'd him and truſted him, long before they truſted
him with theſe Damnable Intreagues you ſpeak of. Beſide they had
his Conſcience under the Lock and Key of an Oath of Secreſie. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Mr. <hi>Impartial,</hi> in my Opinion you are too merry with theſe <hi>damnable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treagues.</hi>
For 'tis as probable that a Villain might ſeek an Opportunity as
well to ſhoot as to ſtab a Prince; and if Providence order'd the prevention of
miſchief, muſt you laugh at that? As little reaſon have you, Mr. <hi>Impartial,</hi> to
make <hi>Chimerical</hi> Armies the ſport of your little Wit. For ſo you may call
them <hi>Chimerical,</hi> out of the abundance of your fancy, yet the intent of raiſing
Armies, and the promiſes and expectations of Foreign Aſſiſtance were not
onely ſworn by the Doctor, but evidently demonſtrable out of <hi>Coleman</hi>'s
Letters, and therefore you muſt not think to cheat the World by burleſquing
Guilt into Innocence.</p>
            <p>But then the Dr. <hi>Depoſes that ſome of them were ſo deſperately mad, as to Preach
Treaſon to a company of Boys.</hi> You triffle with the World, Mr. <hi>Impartial,</hi> and
think to fright People with Rattles and Gewgaws. As if it were ſuch a
ſtrange thing that a <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> within the Walls of his own <hi>Seminary,</hi> before a
Society with which he was well acquainted, before Youths under the aw of
their Superiours, and bred up in the ſame Principles that he Preach'd,
and this too out of the Kings Dominions, ſhould be afraid to declaim Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and to abuſe and villifie a Prince under Excommunication, and Depos'd
by the Authority of <hi>Rome.</hi> All men of underſtanding know that the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
then utter'd, was accounted no Treaſon where it was taught. You would
believe a man that ſhould ſwear he ſaw St. <hi>Dominic</hi> take a Caper from the top
of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church over the Moon, and light upon the top of <hi>Te<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ariff</hi> and yet
will not believe that a craven <hi>Jeſuite</hi> ſhould crow upon his own Dunghil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a King, at the ſame time Un-King'd by the Grand Diſpoſer of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
the Teacher's Idol, and your adored Sovereign, the Pope.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:104686:16"/>
His laſt Wonder, and which methinks, I ſee him with his Hands and
his Eyes lifted up to Heaven, looking upon with moſt amazing Aſtoniſhment,
is the moſt nonſenſical and ridiculous of all. For it centers in this, That
the Dr. <hi>feigned himſelf a Roman Catholick to make diſcoveries for the preſervation
of the</hi> King; yet though he knew the King to be in ſo many and hourly dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and hazards of his Life, he did not preſently cry out <hi>murther upon the
Lords Anointed.</hi> From whence he would infer, that all the Dr. <hi>has ſworn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Plot is damnable Perjury.</hi> Where were you, Mr. <hi>Impartial,</hi> when
the Lord <hi>Staffrod</hi> was Tri'd, that you did not out with your Budget, and
ſpread theſe weighty Objections before his Judges? You are certainly guilty
of his Death, for not lending him your aſſiſtance in ſuch a Time of Diſtreſs.
But I find you are a politick man, and ſuffer'd the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> to loſe his
Head, that you might have the Honour to write his <hi>Memoirs.</hi> Now to the
Point. Becauſe the Dr. did not make his Diſcovery ſo ſoon as he ought to
have done, b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t did it aſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſoon as poſſibly he could, therefore the Dr. is <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd.</hi>
Have you been in Labour, Mr. <hi>Impartial,</hi> this three years, to bring
forth ſuch an Abortive piece of Nonſence as this? This is true <hi>Heraclitus</hi>-like
indeed, to make ſportive Comments upon the intended Aſſaſſination of a
Sovereign Monarch; and then to infer, becauſe the Diſcovery was not made
ſo ſoon as it ſhould have been, that therefore the Diſcovery was nothing
but <hi>Forgery</hi> and <hi>Perjury.</hi> 'Tis well known with what difficulties the Dr.
met, when he made his Diſcovery: And for him to have made it, before he
was well-arm'd with Proof, (the thing which Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi> would have had
him done-was to have ſacrific'd the Kingdom and himſelf to a certain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
'Twas not for him to cry, like a frantick, <hi>murther upon the Lords
Anointed,</hi> where there were ſo many ready to have ſtopped his mouth. Had
he diſcover'd and fail'd, you would have made him <hi>perjur'd</hi> indeed. And
therefore ſince providence has order'd it for the beſt; 'tis not for any mortal
Miſcreant to fix Obl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>quies and Perjuries upon the Diſpoſal and Governance of
the <hi>Almighty</hi> from ſtrain'd Surmiſes, farfetch'd Suppoſitions, and ſportive
Burliſque upon Impiety.</p>
            <p>Having thus done with your particular and punie Eſſay, I will ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
in General The World cannot but take notice, that all your endeavour
is to lay the ſtreſs and weight of your malice and fury upon the Doctor: He is
the chiefeſt mark of all your envenom'd Arrows. Let him alone, if he be
ſuch a <hi>perjur'd</hi> Monſter, he'l fallof himſelf.</p>
            <q>
               <l>The Heathens themſelves will tell yee,</l>

            </q>
            <p>There is no avoiding the vengeance of Heaven. In the mean time to fling
and kick and wince to no purpoſe; to bring Evaſions, Flams, Flaſhes and
Stories; to Bribe, to Suborn, to ſet up Swearing Schools, to Defame and
Scandalize, to cry out Perjury, Nonſence, Abſurdities, Improbabilities;
Theſe are not Waies to clear the Innocent, but rather Demonſtrations of the
Treaſon pretended to be vindicated. You have ſome reaſons to believe that you
have now ſome paticular advantages over the Dr. and therefore you take the
oportunity to hunt him quite down. The <hi>pitiful Wretch</hi> ſo contemn'd &amp; diſpis'd
by the <hi>Benedictine Rabbies,</hi> and <hi>Jeſuitical Flamins,</hi> muſt be trod upon, and die
the death of a Worm, becauſe he out-witted their Cunning: The moſt convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Argument of his Integritie, that ſuch <hi>Goliahs</hi> of Policy and Reaſon, as
they, ſhould fall by his Imbicillitie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:104686:16"/>
Now all this ſtir and Turmoyl, is to prove the Dr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>perjur'd.</hi> Which makes
me to admire that Mr. <hi>Impartial,</hi> and the reſt of his Fellow Jeſuites, who
account themſelves the Topping Order of the Catholick Religion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
themſelves to have engroſs'd all the Learning in the World into their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties,
ſhould ſo groſly miſtake themſelves, as to err in the very foundation
of their Deſign. I cannot therefore apprehend 'em to be ſuch Bugbears as
they are, but that it is onely the fond Opinion of our deluded Gentry, that
cauſes them to throw their Children into the Boſom of their Education. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I take Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi> and them to be like our Splitters of Cauſes, who
onely ſtudy the Snaps and Quirks of falſe Practice, but know little of the
Fundamentals and Body of the Law; and that as they ſtudy onely the Knaviſh
part of the Law; ſo theſe onely ſtudy the Knaviſh part of Divinity, that is how
to cheat and amuſe by vertue of their Profeſſion. Now then for Mr. <hi>Impartial,</hi>
to go about to prove a man perjur'd, before he had aſſerted what Perjury was,
is a very prepoſterous way of defending the Innocent. A <hi>Perjurer,</hi> then, <hi>is one,
that ſwears wilfully and wickedly againſt the opinion and judgment of his heart.</hi> So that
there is a great difference betwen <hi>Perjury</hi> and <hi>ſwearing falſe.</hi> A perjur'd Perſon
is one, who wilfully and willingly ſwears a falſe thing. But he who ſwears falſe,
does not do it with an intention to deceive, but becauſe he believes the thing ſo
to be. <hi>Non falſum jurare est perjurare,</hi> ſaith Cicero, <hi>ſed quod ex amini tui ſentencia,
ſicut verbis concipitur more noſtro, id non facere perjurium eſt.</hi> Now the Dr. ſwore
there was a Plot, as knowing it to be really true, <hi>examini ſui ſententia,</hi> but
as to Circumſtances, he onely ſwore as believing them to be ſo, <hi>ita rem ſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere.</hi>
So that it being impoſſible to impute <hi>animum decipiendi</hi> to the Dr. from
bare ſurmiſes and conjectures; fram'd impoſſibilities and abſurdities, which
have no efficacy to force belief, but are left indifferent, as not being the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Reaſon, but of Paſſion and Intereſt; ſo is it much more impoſſible
(if there may be degrees of impoſſibility) to infer <hi>Perjury</hi> from the triffling
ſhifts and Evaſions of guilty Iniquitie, which ſort of managing the defence
of the Innocent does but diſcover the Vermin in the Snare, and carries ſuch
a Face of guilty Fallacy, that while Men obſerve the doublings and eluſive
ſlights of the Writer, rather to diſintangle, then juſtifie his dear Friends,
it loſes the reputation of a Defence, and becomes rather an Accuſation then
a Vindication.</p>
            <p>This is alſo a moſt obſervable Circumſtance on the Drs. ſide, that he has
accus'd no man <hi>hand over head,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi> calls it, but charges one with
one thing, another with another, as he knew they acted in their ſeveral Sphears
of Treaſon and Mischief. Which Charges being afterwards prov'd by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Perſons that the Dr. had never ſeen or heard of in his Life, and centring
exactly as he had fixed the Delinquents in their Employments, proves that the
Dr. was not ſo little acquainted with the deſign as they would fain pretend him
to be. And therefore let Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi> get his <hi>Memoirs</hi> Tranſlated as ſoon as
he pleaſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſend them abroad with all the ſpeed he can; certainly the
rational part of the World muſt believe, that it had been impoſſible for Dr.
<hi>Otes</hi> to have born up his head in the publick Face of the World, to have ſtood
the ſtrict Examination of a wiſe and diſcerning Monarch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His Council and
His Parliaments; which implies all the Prudence, Judgment, Policy and
Juſtice of the Nation, had not his Diſcovery been abſolutely true; which
could never have been ſo, had he been deceiv'd in the Perſons of the Actors.
Unleſs there be any ſo ſtupidly Brutiſh as to believe, that the King and the
whole Flower of the Nobility and Gentry of the Nation were in a Conſpiracy
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:104686:17"/>
with Dr. <hi>Otes</hi> againſt a Company of Tatterdemallion Jeſuites, and half a
dozen Popiſh Lords and their delued Aſſociates, who might all have been
buried among the forgotten Crowd, had not they like the firer of the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi>
Temple made themſelves famous by their Infamy.</p>
            <p>I may add this farther for the Drs. Reputation, and the Papiſts ſhame:
who though they continually tax him with <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Debauchery,</hi> could never
yet charge him but it prov'd to their treble diſadvantage. Once they brought
a ridiculous evidence from <hi>Haſtings,</hi> which was exploded in open Court, and
when that fail'd, not being able to find out any thing more, they fell to their
old Trade of Subornation, and purchas'd the Releaſe of Rake-Hells out of
Jayl to taint him with the hazard, if not the Eternal loſs of their Souls. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
had the Dr. been ſo openly vitious, they did very ill to ſtain their own
Reputation ſo foully to fully his.</p>
            <p>And now he comes to his Obſervations upon the Tryal it ſelf; to which
there needs little or no anſwer to be given, as being a ridiculous piece of Fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
ſcurrilous Meſs of Inſtances and Inferences, Contradictions and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities,
Evaſions and impertinent Cavils handed into the world by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Proteſtant in defence of the Papiſts; and all depending upon a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious
Suppoſition, that our Witneſſes are perjur'd, and his not. In ſhort,
a miſchievous <hi>Avernus</hi> of Fallacy and Impudence, exhaling nothing but Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
and Reproach againſt his Sovereign and his Applauded Government. And
indeed, if we conſider his own words, the daring Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi> has given
ſuch an anſwer to himſelf, that had he not been blinded with ſome ponderous
Bribe, or deeply engag'd in the fatal Concern that threatens both his own and
his Employers Heads, might have ſtopp'd the Career of his extravagant Pen,
while he himſelf gives the rational world all the ſufficing ſatisfaction can be
imagined. For he acknowledges the whole Proceſs was heard before a <hi>High Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
Iluſtrious Judges,</hi> and an <hi>Auguſt Aſſembly.</hi> And ſo moſt certainly it was.
For there was His Majeſty Himſelf every day preſent; the Greateſt Peers of
the Nation were the Judges; and there was a full Aſſembly of the Lords
and Commons of <hi>England.</hi> Now whether theſe were not competent Judges
of Perjury, Contradiction and Abſurditie—I am forc'd to ſtop, becauſe
Human Invention can ſay no more. Earth could afford no more: unleſs his
Lordſhip expected that ſome Court of Angels ſhould have deſcended on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
from Heaven. Howſoever, he had thoſe to hear and determin his Cauſe
to whom Sacred Writ has attributed the ſolemn Character of Divinity: And
yet all this will not ſatisfie Mr. <hi>Impartial,</hi> nor his Crew of Diabolical Papiſts.
Diabolical in this, that they will be continually ſpurning againſt Terreſtrial
Majeſty, in imitation of their Grand Maſter in perpetual enmity with the
Majeſty of Heaven. But on theſe the Viper dares not faſten his envenom'd
Teeth: and therefore he endeavours to nip the Reputation of thoſe Learned
and Noble Gentlemen that manag'd the Tryal, that from the wounds of their
Honour he might draw a Tincture to varniſh the Horrid Deformity of the
Plot, and beſmare the Juſtice of <hi>Staffords</hi> Condemnation. For of them he
ſays, <hi>that nothing was omitted, nothing neglected, but every the least Circumſtance
enforc'd and advanc'd to its full proportion; with ſuch a vigour of wit and induſtry,
&amp;c.</hi> As if they had laid aſide their conſciences, and made uſe of all their wit,
their induſtry, and their eloquence meerly to advance falſe Accuſation and
Perjury. For this is the clear Expoſition of <hi>Mr. Impartials</hi> wicked Inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
We'l take the reſt in their order. The Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> had brought
evidence to teſtifie, That <hi>Dugdale</hi> before his Diſcovery, <hi>had deni'd, and with
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:104686:17"/>
Execrations forſwore any knowledg of the Plot,</hi> which the Managers ſaid was no objection.
For he ſwore it at a time when he never intended to reveal the Plot, and was in danger of
Life; but that afterwards he chang'd his mind, and diſcoverd all to <hi>Southel</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>To this Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi> anſwers, <hi>That 'twas ſtrange ſo palpable a Perjury ſhould he ſo ſligh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
evaded.</hi> And thus Mr. <hi>Impartial,</hi> caſting a miſt before his own eyes; for he cannot
ſurely choſe but know what Perjury is, throws a moſt heavy aſperſion upon the Sanctity
of the moſt Illuſtrious Judges of the World, <hi>that they ſlightly paſs'd over all palpable Perjury.</hi>
Now how does he make it out? by crying, <hi>this is a criminal anſwer?</hi> meaning that of the
Managers. Yes it was. For <hi>Dugdale</hi> denying the Plot before he intended to diſcover it,
though with Imprecations, was onely <hi>Peccatum in foro Conſcientiae,</hi> not determinable by the
Law, and 'tis the Law that muſt tell you what Perjury is. Did <hi>Dugdale</hi> deny the Plot upon
his Oath before the King and Council; and upon the ſame Oath affirm it again? Had you
prov'd that, you had ſaid ſomething. Otherwiſe you have done nothing but brought
your <hi>Impartialſhip</hi> under the Laſh of the Law, which indeed, Mr. <hi>Impartial,</hi> you mightily
deſerve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for your Crime is heinous.</p>
            <p>In the next place, he charges the Managers with common <hi>Sophiſms and weak Objections.</hi>
And yet but now they were the moſt Eloquent and Wittie Men in the World. Here's
more work for the ſtripes of the common Hangman; for certainly ſuch Illuſtrious Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
knew better what belong'd to <hi>common Sophiſms and weak Objections,</hi> then ſuch an <hi>Atome</hi> of
a <hi>Memoir-monger,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Impartial.</hi> And beſides. Sir, you don't know but my Lord's
Servants have been at the <hi>Swearing-School.</hi> For proof of which, 'tis notorious in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Tryal, how <hi>Furneſs</hi> was trapp'd by the Lord High Steward and himſelf, <hi>p. 83.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>p. 37.</hi> He taxes the Court of <hi>ſhifting off Perjury by a trifling jeſt.</hi> Which requires no
other then the firm anſwer, and the ſame correction. For the ſcandal ſtill lies upon the
Court, who whatever the Managers ſaid, where to conſider the weight of the Matter.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, the World may well wonder, that ſuch a malicious Piece of pretended Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantiſm
ſhould adventure with his frivolous objections ſo inſinuatingly to beſpatter the
Learning and Integrity of thoſe moſt worthy Patriots, that ſo highly deſerve by their great
Circumſpection and Induſtry, from the whole Nation, and the Proteſtant Religion. But
the Profeſſion of true Proteſtantiſm being the moſt refin'd in the World, 'tis no more
then could be expected from a Maggot of that common Proverb, <hi>Corruptio optima eſt peſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi>
Whoſe whole Diabolical Deſign being onely to traduce; and by traducing true worth
and virtue, to aſſert the innocence of Trayterous Popery; it cannot be thought, that
reaſon and Loyalty will judge the better of the Lord <hi>Staffords</hi> Innocency; becauſe they
behav'd themſelves ſo nobly and renownedly in the proſecution of his Treaſons.</p>
            <p>And thus you ſee the moſt Gigantic force and ſtrength of his arguments for the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> being brought to the Block. A bold and audacious Recrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon the United Wiſdom and Juſtice of the whole Kingdom. What ſuch a foul-mouth'd
<hi>Mr. Cover-Plot</hi> may deſerve, I will not be ſo adventurous as to put the queſtion:
However, it is not to be doubted, but that all His Majeſties moſt true and Loyal Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Subjects hope in time to ſee him duly rewarded according to his deſerts.</p>
            <p>In the next place, he troubles the World with my Lords <hi>Principles of Truth and Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
What does it concern us, what his Principles were, if his actions were otherwiſe?
Nor will Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi> eaſily perſwade the World, That a Traitor in his actions could
be Loyal in his Principles. The Sacred Lips of Chriſt himſelf hath taught us, that we
muſt judg of the Tree by its Fruit. <hi>Cromwel,</hi> that committed that unparallell'd Murther
of God's Anointed, was the moſt compleat Counterfeiter of outward Sanctity of any of
his Time. So that the ridiculous account of my Lords Principles was moſt unſeaſonable
and inſignificant.</p>
            <p>As little to the purpoſe is that vain Recapitulation of the Cream of the Pa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> Tenents.
For that Religion can be no Religion, that has not ſome Tenents tending to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality;
but what ſignifies that? We know the Rules of all the Popiſh Orders are very
ſtrict, and ſavouring of a moſt Seraphic Holineſs; yet none more generally wicked and
diſſolute then they that live under thoſe Holy Vows. Even the Order of Jeſus cannot
exempt the profeſſours of it from being the moſt pernicious of men. But Mr. <hi>Impartial,</hi>
ſince you have been picking and culling the Strawberries of your Religion, what think you
of the p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>ſonous Mandrake-Aples that follow? Since you have politickly taken this
oportunity, to ſow the choiſeſt of your Grain, on purpoſe to ſeduce and win the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;
I will take the boldneſs to throw a double quantity of you own Darnel Seed among
it, to prevent the growth of it in the hear<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of the people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:104686:18"/>
To which end I begin thus, That the Popiſh Religion is a ſcandal to all <hi>Europe,</hi> bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſqu'd
and paſquin'd by thoſe that daily behold the Foolleries and Debaucheries of its
moſt Exalted <hi>Aaarns</hi> and <hi>High Prieſt.</hi> A Religion that maintains that inveterate, impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
and imbred hatred to Proteſtantiſm, contrary to the Character of Chriſtianity, that
the Inſtances of it in Hiſtory would ſerve to compile a Volume.</p>
            <p>Read but the Lives of the Popes, and there you ſhall find a Progeny of <hi>Chriſts Vicars,</hi>
and S. <hi>Peter Succeſſors,</hi> as they call themſelves, infamous for their Frauds, Perjuries, Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies,
loſt Conſciences, Buggeries, Defilements, and Proſtitutions of their own Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
Adulteries, Poyſonings, Atheiſm; and in ſhort, for all manner of Villany and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery.
And when the Fountains are ſo filthy and impure, Let the World judg what
the Streams that flow from thence muſt be. Their Monaſteries Sties of Beſtialitie, their
Nunneries Brothel-Houſes.</p>
            <p>Their Doctrine, common principles, and practiſe the frequent Excommunications and
Murders of Princes, the legallity of Equivocation and Perjury; that there is no faith to
be kept with Hereticks; that libertie of Religion granted to Proteſtants is repugnant to
the Law of God: that it is the duty of the Papiſts to deſtroy the Proteſtants, by Fire,
Sword, Poyſon, Gun-powder, or any other way moſt oportune. That there is no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
or allegiance due to Heretical Magiſtrates and Princes. Theſe are the ſingular and
genuine Principles of Popery. Which they that will not believe, let 'em read the Works
of <hi>Simancha, Conradus Brunus, Martin Becanus, Cardinal Baronius, Mariana Peter de Ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
Creſwel, Freſham,</hi> and the Decree of <hi>Vrban</hi> the 2d. <hi>That they ſhould not be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Murtherers, that kill any of the Enemies of the Roman Ctholick Cahurch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus after a rambling, impertinent, Story of his Lordſhips behaviour, that looks
like a piece of Romance enterlanded with Love-Letters, he brings his Lordſhip to the
Scaffold, where he avers to the World three notorious <hi>Rappers,</hi> two of them in a Breath
<hi>After a ſhort pauſe he ſtept to one ſide of the Scaffold, and with a graceful Air and intelligible
Voice pronounced his laſt Speech.</hi> A very graceful Air indeed, encourag'd and highten'd
with ſtupifying, and therefore undaunted Inebriation, which the near Spectators well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd.
However, this is as true as the next, that he <hi>pronounc'd</hi> his Speech, when they
that were at a diſtance might eaſily perceive he read it every word; and as they that ſtood
by related, very fumblingly too. And indeed it could not be otherwiſe expected. For you
know, Mr. <hi>Impartial,</hi> his Lordſhip was never accounted a Speech-maker in his Life; and
for a perſon under his circumſtances, and of his mean parts, to read the ſence of other
men intelligibly, and with a graceful Air, is a thing more improbable then any of your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities.
And therefore, Mr. <hi>Impartial,</hi> you muſt lay your ſtories cloſer together next
time. But when the Head was held up by the Excutioner, what then? <hi>The People made
no acclamations at the ſight.</hi> By which bloudy untruth ſo bloudily averr'd; it is moſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apparent what credit is to be given to all than Mr. <hi>Impartial</hi> has been clamouring all <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his
while. It being apparent, that he who ſhall tell ſuch a publick falſhood ſo eaſie to be evinc'd,
would never ſcruple to make a thouſand wilful miſtakes clandeſtinly. Surely, he was either
deaf, or he had ſtopp'd his Ears with <hi>Plaiſter</hi> of <hi>Paris.</hi> For certainly ſuch a number of
people could never have fill'd the Skie with lowder <hi>ſhouts</hi> and <hi>hollows,</hi> unleſs they had had the
Throats of <hi>Stentor</hi> himſelf. And therefore if there were any that went away with <hi>confuſion</hi>
and <hi>remorſe,</hi> or cri'd him up for <hi>a juſt man,</hi> they were onely ſome of his own Gang, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtical
Tribe, of Handcherchief-dippers. It ſeems there were others, that ſaid, <hi>he was
drunk with Brandy;</hi> and then 'twas no wonder his <hi>Air was</hi> ſo graceful indeed. Truly, Mr.
<hi>Impartial,</hi> you had better have left that Remark out of your <hi>Memoirs,</hi> for now you put me
in mind of it, 'twas ſo reported, nay aſſerted, and by many ſtill ſo believ'd: and indeed it
is an an obſervation, moſt agreeable to your diſcription of his behaviour toward the people,
and his intelligible <hi>pronunciation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>i'd this Famous Traitor, whoſe Cauſe if it were innocent, there was never
ſuch a miſtake committed ſince <hi>Adam</hi> was expell'd the Garden of <hi>Eden.</hi> Which becauſe
it cannot be thought within the Verge of ſuſpicion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore the <hi>Popiſh Plot</hi> remains a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
