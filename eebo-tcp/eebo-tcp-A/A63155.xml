         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Sermon,</hi> tending to ſtir up our exceeding vicious and debauched Age to
a ſtartling Conſideration of the near Approach of Chriſt to Judgment
(the great Argument uſed both by our Saviour and the Primitive

Providence hath wonderfully preſerved theſe Nations from that
<hi>Immediate Deſtruction</hi> (now Three Years) which theſe <hi>Two falſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi>

            <p>Theſe <hi>Two,</hi> (who thought themſelves little inferior to the <hi>Two

times.</p>
            <p>That the Sins of <hi>England,</hi> (and particularly of this City) are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great, beyond all others in the World beſides, if we conſider the

hath done for others, and the many <hi>Warnings</hi> we have had by ſeveral
great Judgments, (both of <hi>Plague, Fire, Earth-quakes, War,</hi> &amp;c.)
and our great Incorrigible Frame, growing rather worſe and worſe

Scriptures, how prevalent the Cries and Prayers of one or other of
his peculiar Favourites have been, in turning away his Wrath from
a City or Nation) is a Secret amongſt his <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> into which

ſuch Confidence and Infallibility, as if they had <hi>ſate in Council with the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105922:6"/>
Almighty,</hi> and that <hi>the Secret of VViſdom and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> had been
locked up within their Breaſt: And yet if they were <hi>Divinely aſſured</hi>
that <hi>God</hi> had revealed a <hi>prefixed Period</hi> for his <hi>Judgment;</hi> nay, though he
had confirmed it with a Sacred <hi>Oath,</hi> and that it ſeemed never ſo
<hi>Poſitive</hi> or <hi>Irrevocable,</hi> yet the whole Tenor of Scripture, (as by and
by we ſhall obſerve in ſeveral great Inſtances) in all its Prophetick
parts agrees herein, <hi>viz.</hi> That God reſerves a <hi>Secret or tacit Condition,</hi>
and (either Implicitly or Explicitly) reſolving, notwithſtanding,
to ſhew Mercy, and not to deſtroy in caſe of Repentance, let their
Doom be never ſo great, and the Period never ſo plainly expreſs'd,

though our Iniquity teſtifie againſt us, do thou it for thy Names ſake; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
our Back-bitings are many, and we have ſinned againſt thee. O the
hope of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Saviour in the time of trouble, VVhy ſhouldſt thou be
as a Stranger in the Land; As a Man that cannot ſave? Yet thou O Lord
art in the midſt of us, and we are called by thy Name, leave us not. <hi>The
Prophet better underſtood Gods Will, and had a nearer acceſs to his
Heart, and was more acquainted with his Secret than</hi> T. VV. <hi>and</hi>
V. E. (<hi>our two late Prophets) can pretend to be. A Bleſſed Prophet
whereof we have in that famous Text,</hi> Iſa. 48. 1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hear ye this, O
Houſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> which art called by the Name of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who ſwear by the
Name of the Lord, and mention the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but not in Truth and
Righteouſneſs: For they call themſelves of the Holy City, and Stay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
on the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy Neck
an Iron Sinew, and thy Brow Braſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet thou heardest not, yea thou
knowest not, yea from that time that thy Ear was not opened; for I know
thou wouldest deal very treacherouſly, and wast called a Tranſgreſſor from
the VVomb. Yet for my Names ſake will I defer my anger, and for my
Praiſe will I refrain that I cut thee not off for my own, even for my own ſake,
will I do it, for how ſhould my Name be polluted? and I will not give my Glory
to another. <hi>Which is an excellent Coment on that Famous Text in</hi>
Deut. 32. 26. <hi>Where we may ſee by what wonderful</hi> Argument <hi>God
is pleaſed to perſuade himſelf from a total Rejection of this his Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and Rebellious People, who had been a continual provocation to
him, from the day they came out of</hi> Egypt <hi>all along in</hi> the VVilderneſs
for Forty Years. I ſaid I would ſcatter them into Corners, I would make
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105922:6"/>
their remembrance to ceaſe from among Men,—<hi>v.</hi> 27. Were it not that
I feared the wrath of the Enemy, leſt their Adverſaries ſhould behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

(ſome would do well to perſwade him thus plainly to expreſs himſelf,

them.</hi>) And he often repeats it, that we may not miſtake him in ſuch
a matter of importance, <hi>viz.</hi> That this Belief of his, That God's
Decree is irrevocably gone out to deſtroy us immediately, without
any limited Conditions of our Repentance, is the <hi>Great Point or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of his Faith,</hi> (as pag. 11.) [<hi>though my Faith in a Judgment immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
coming upon us, be the principal thing I am enlightned in,</hi> &amp;c.] And
pag. 11. (<hi>I am in the Faith of it ſtill.</hi>) And again (in the ſane Page)
[<hi>If I ſhould grant this a Deluſion, O how would it break my Faith all in
Pieces? And therefore there is a neceſſity laid upon me to maintain that it
is from <hi>God,</hi> becauſe I ſhould overthrow my <hi>Religion</hi> if I did not.</hi>]
I wiſh he knew what his <hi>Religion</hi> is, if he can tell us. Again (in
his Poſtſcript) [<hi>And therefore I dare not ſo much as admit of an
If:</hi>] As much as if he had ſaid, God hath determined that all our
<hi>Repentance</hi> ſhall not prevent his <hi>Infallible Decree</hi> that is gone out. And
in pag. 12. he proceeds [<hi>I cannot tell how any can make out that this
Faith is a Deluſion, but he must reflect upon That</hi>—Speaking in the
Words before of David'<hi>s Teſtimony of the Spirit,</hi> touching his own
Salvation; thus equalling his <hi>Impreſſion</hi> or <hi>Impulſe</hi> with the <hi>Sacred
<hi>Seal</hi> or Witneſs of the Spirit.</hi> And if we track him a little further (in
the ſame twelfth Page) he is reſolved to die a Martyr for this <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Point</hi> or <hi>Article</hi> of his <hi>Religion</hi> [<hi>Now you ſee it is come to this
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105922:7"/>
Iſſue, that I am to maintain this <hi>Faith</hi> even unto the Death.</hi>] But the
beſt of all is in p. 14. [<hi>This is to be ſeen only by an Eye of <hi>Faith</hi>
               </hi>] A
little before he ſpake of <hi>Armies</hi> of God's ſending [which we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
he did not mean of <hi>Locuſts</hi> (except the French Locuſts) nor yet
of ſwarms of <hi>Flies,</hi> &amp;c.] and though his natural Eye-ſight could not
look croſs the Seas into <hi>France,</hi> yet it is difficult to perſwade us that
he had not heard what great Preparations <hi>Lewis le Grande</hi> had made by
Sea and Land for giving us a Viſit to deſtroy the <hi>Northern Hereſy</hi> (ſo
called) <hi>cum multis aliis;</hi> and then his Faith is but a <hi>moral Perſwaſion</hi>
and no Divine <hi>Revelation.</hi> Now if he hath never heard of theſe things,
we may ſafely conjecture he hath ſlept for ſome Years, like <hi>Epimenides,</hi>
(and might alſo fall into a Dream) But if he hath heard thereof, and
believes the ſame, then his Faith is no more Divine than that of every
<hi>Philonides</hi> (as to theſe things;) and if there is a <hi>Peculiarity</hi> in his <hi>Faith</hi>
(as he will needs have it to be) we find no foundation for it it in all the
Scripture [<hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>England hath out-ſinned her Day of Grace, and
that all our most hearty Endeavours to Repent and Turn to God will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Infallible Certainty of our immediate Deſtruction:</hi> Or indeed that
<hi>any Nation or People though never ſo wicked, did ever lie under ſuch a
Doom:</hi>] And though Chriſt's Words unto <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> [<hi>O that thou hadst
known in this thy Day the things that belonged to thy Peace, but now they are
hid from thy Eyes</hi>] ſeems to come neareſt hereunto, yet we are to note,
1. That Expreſſion had not a direct tendency to the Salvation of their
Souls, as if thereby they had been laid under an utter Impoſſibility of
Repenting, for the Words are an Appendant to that Expreſſion before
[<hi>How often would I have gathered you together as a Hen her Chickens under
her Wing</hi>] which ſome eminent Divines (together with Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
alſo) underſtand of our Saviour's intentions of <hi>gathering them
into a National Church, under the Goſpel Adminiſtration, and under a
most peculiar Protection,</hi> as of old they had been in the <hi>Legal Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</hi>]
2. Chriſt exhorts them afterwards as a <hi>collective Body,</hi> to
Repent and turn to God (<hi>Daughters of Jeſus weep for your Sins,</hi> &amp;c.)
3. And he prays for them (as a <hi>Nation</hi> conſidered) who were guilty
of his Death, in the whole Body Politick, [<hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Chief Prieſts
and Elders,</hi> or <hi>ruling Sanedrim,</hi> and in its <hi>Members</hi> alſo, when <hi>all the
People cryed</hi> out unanimouſly, <hi>Crucify, crucify him,</hi>] and yet he prays
<hi>Father forgive them (i. e.</hi>) if they will afterwards repent by the
preaching of the Goſpel. 4. Chriſt ſent his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and Miniſters to
preach <hi>Repentance</hi> to the whole Nation (elſe why did they enter into
the <hi>Jews Synagogues,</hi> from time to time, on their Sabbath Day) Forty
Years after his Death, before their City was deſtroyed, and about
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105922:7"/>
Sixty Years to the Remnant afterwards, before they were totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
from being a Nation.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>W.</hi> will needs have this Faith and Belief of his (thus rivet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into his Head by ſtrong impulſe) to be the <hi>Standard</hi> or <hi>Touchſtone</hi> not
only of his own <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> but for his Apprehenſions of
<hi>others Chriſtianity</hi> alſo; (pag. 15.) [<hi>They ſeem all of them to have a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Grace in them who have this <hi>Faith</hi> though they may not have great
Parts:</hi>] And that their <hi>Faith</hi> ſhould not prove a <hi>Choak-Pear</hi> to any of
us, they <hi>interlard</hi> their <hi>Divinity</hi> with a ſeeming regard unto <hi>the Scripture</hi>
(in the ſame 15th page) [<hi>And they all ſeem to have ſome Impreſſion made
upon their Heart from Scripture.</hi>] One great Argument for the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Word of God is, That all <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Sectaries</hi> will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
thereof, and fetch their Proofs even from Sacred Writ, though it
is evident that the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> (and ſome of her Children who
hang on her Skirts, though in Diſguiſe to captivate ſilly Souls) uſe the
<hi>Holy Bible</hi> as the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> did the <hi>Ark,</hi> who being perplext (and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſmitten in their Conſciences) thereby, hoiſe it up, as decently as
they can on their Wooden-Cart [<hi>Tradition,</hi> &amp;c.] and drive it out of
their Coaſts, ſending it away from them (to take its Lot) with the
deteſtable Offerings of their <hi>Golden Mice.</hi>

            <p>In the laſt-mentioned Page Mr. <hi>Th. Ward</hi> gives us a Copy of his

            <p>Another Fencing-Blow Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> gives us (in the ſame <hi>Poſtſcript</hi>)

               <hi>Valentine Evans</hi> (his fellow <hi>Witneſs</hi>) comes after, and tells us, he <hi>is

concerning Judgment on any Perſon, City, or

               <p>MANY famous Inſtances hereof we have in SCRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PTURE.</p>
               <p>1. God ſeemed moſt poſitive, that he would <hi>drown the old World,</hi>
repeating his purpoſe many times, without once expreſſing his Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
to ſpare them if they repented (at leaſt that we read of)
but plainly threatning to wait no longer than One hundred and twenty
Years (<hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 7, 15, 17. compared with ch. 7. 4.) and at the end of
that period then to deſtroy them: Yet this had a ſecret Condition in
it, with a Reſolution to have ſpared them upon Repentance, and God's
Patience and long-Suffering towards them in bearing and forbearing
ſo long, had a direct tendency unto this great <hi>End, 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 20. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
               <p>2. God ſeems moſt poſitive for <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s <hi>Deſtruction;</hi> and ſeveral
Texts plainly tell us, <hi>God hardned him</hi> [<hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 21. 7. 3, 13, 14.
9. 12, 15, 16.] And S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſets him forth as a famous Figure of that
which we call <hi>Reprobation,</hi> Rom. 9. 17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] Not that God is <hi>Active</hi> in
hardning any Sinner, or in tempting any unto Evil (as <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 13.)
but only is pleaſed to deny to ſome his <hi>ſanctifying Grace,</hi> for their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105922:9"/>
abuſe of the <hi>Strivings of the Spirit</hi> in his <hi>common Grace</hi> (or in a Word,
for ſinning unto high degrees againſt the Light and Conviction of
their Illuminating Conſcience.) And becauſe this moſt juſt denyal, is
the <hi>Antecedent</hi> of that <hi>Infallible Conſequent,</hi> (viz. Hardneſs of Heart,
and Impenitency) and bears ſuch an <hi>Analogical</hi> reſemblance of the
<hi>Cauſe</hi> and it's <hi>Effect,</hi> therefore the Scripture ſo frequently expreſſeth
it, as if God was <hi>Active</hi> in it, as the ſimple or <hi>Phyſical Cauſe</hi> of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
wicked Men, which in reality is no other than his leaving thoſe
ſelf-hardning Sinners, (who reſolve to perſiſt in Sin without fear and
trembling, againſt the checks and wounds of their Enlightned Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience)
unto the Luſts and Corruptions of their own Hearts, which
without his Sanctifying Grace, will aſſuredly ariſe daily unto greater
and ſtronger Rebellions, and end in final Obduracy, Unbelief and
Impenitency. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was left by God to the liberty and freedom
of his own Will, [for who queſtions, but he had the power to let
<hi>Iſrael</hi> go,] (as appears plainly from <hi>Exod. 3. 19. Chap.</hi> 9. 30, 34.)
but he firſt <hi>hardens his own Heart</hi> againſt God, before God in his Juſt
Judgment left him to himſelf, [as <hi>Ex.</hi> 5. 3. 8. 15, 32. 9. 30, 34. And
the (Heathen) <hi>Philiſtines</hi> had learnt ſo much Divinity, that the
grand <hi>Cauſe of</hi> Pharaohs <hi>Destruction</hi> was to be layd at <hi>his own Door,</hi>
and not at <hi>Gods,</hi> in that Famous Text of 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 6. God really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſhould Obey him, and had rather he ſhould have Turned
and Lived for ever in his Favour, then to have periſhed in his Sin,
(if we dare credit the Scripture, and take it in its own expreſs
words, without Mens Gloſſes and Coments) <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 5, 8, 9. 6. 13,
29. 7. 1, 2, 8. 10. 9. 20. And <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 3. puts it yet more clearly
out of doubt, [<hi>How long wilt thou yet refuſe to humble thy ſelf before me?</hi>]
And to make it yet more evident, we are to conſider that the <hi>Firſt
Threatning</hi> God ſent him was, <hi>The Death of the Firſt-born throughout</hi>
Aegypt, and this Judgment was the ſame, that after all made him bow
by force, [<hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 23. compared with <hi>Ch.</hi> 11. 1, 4, 5.] Thus Gods
Patience and Long-ſuffering waited on this ſelf-deſtroyer, to bring
him unto Repentance and Salvation, as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9. And thus it wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

               <p>3. What more poſitive than the <hi>Deſtruction of the</hi> Canaanites, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times Sentenced to be all cut off, (<hi>Exod. 23. 24. Deut.</hi> 7. 2, 16,

Ezech. 21. 7. 2 Kings 20. 17, 18. <hi>Ch.</hi> 23. 26, 27. The laſt Text

               <p>5. What looks more like a <hi>poſitive Decree for Deſtruction,</hi> than Gods

Damnation of any, than Chriſt himſelf is pleaſed to expreſs

<hi>Blaſphemed that Holy Spirit,</hi> by which they were convinced he did thoſe
great <hi>Miracles</hi> among them? In ſhort, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is foreſhewn, the <hi>Jews</hi>
final rejection of Chriſt, by reaſon of that height of Impiety which
ſhould amount to no leſs than <hi>The Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which the
Prophet gives us very Emphatically, <hi>Iſa. 6. 10. Make their Hearts
fat, and their Ears heavy, and ſhut their Eyes, lest they ſee and hear, and
underſtand, and convert and be healed.</hi> And our Saviour often reminds
them of this <hi>Prophecy,</hi> telling them it was <hi>then fulfilled</hi> by their hei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t of
wilful Impiety, which through Gods Righteous Judgment, rendred
his <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which he Preached unto them in his own Sacred Perſon <hi>The
Savour of Death unto Death,</hi> although it came amongſt them for this
Primary <hi>End,</hi> that it might <hi>Enlighten</hi> and <hi>Convert.</hi> Now that theſe
<hi>Jews</hi> had actually ſinned <hi>The Sin againſt the Holy Ghost,</hi> [and ſo were
given up afterwards unto that <hi>Judicial Blindneſs</hi> and <hi>Obduracy,</hi> as iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the <hi>Crucifixion</hi> of their <hi>Meſſias,</hi>] <hi>Christ</hi> expreſly tells us in

                  </gap>,
which we Tranſlate, <hi>Is in danger of Eternal Damnation;</hi> and this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
with <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> who, expreſſing the <hi>moſt dangerous State</hi> which this

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105922:10"/>
and ſo remarkable, that each of the Four Evangeliſts quote it againſt
them, <hi>Matth. 13. 14. Mark 4. 12. Luke 8. 10. John</hi> 12. 40. Beſides, St.
<hi>Paul</hi> alſo <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 27.] yet, leaves them not without a <hi>poſſibility of
Salvation,</hi> [<hi>leſt they ſhould Convert and be healed.</hi>] And if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the former Scriptures with <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 7, 8. we may find that this
<hi>Judicial Blindneſs</hi> is a <hi>Mark</hi> of their own <hi>Self-reprobation,</hi> and in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinction
from <hi>thoſe other Jews,</hi> who were of the <hi>Peculiar Election</hi>
of Grace. The Summary gathered from the whole Premiſes is this,
that as on the one hand none can be encouraged to think, that any,
living and dying in final Obduracy and final Unbelief, can have any
poſſibility of Salvation, (being a flat contradiction <hi>in Terminis</hi>) ſo on
the other hand there is no Scripture Ground for any Perſon, City or
Nation, though lying under a <hi>Poſitive</hi> and ſeeming <hi>Irrevocable Decree</hi>
of Wrath, to paſs a <hi>Definitive Sentence</hi> againſt themſelves. Which to
do, is to enter into Gods <hi>moſt ſecret place of Thunder,</hi> into which he
would not ſuffer any of his deareſt Favourites, (no not the Holy
<hi>Prophets</hi> or <hi>Penmen</hi> of his Word) to enter. And the reaſon is very
plain. <hi>For</hi> that Diſcovery, who, (for certain) ſhall live and dye in
Final Unbelief, (or in other words, who they are that will be Self-murderers)
which is the true <hi>Cauſe</hi> and <hi>Ground</hi> of <hi>Gods <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchangable
and Irrevocable Decree for their Damnation,</hi>) would forthwith drive
them into <hi>Final</hi> and <hi>Irrecoverable Deſperation</hi> and <hi>Condemnation,</hi> and
which is contrary to Gods Great <hi>End,</hi> in all his <hi>Severest Threatnings,</hi>
(even in thoſe Caſes which ſeem moſt forlorn in Man's Eye,) the
whole <hi>Scripture</hi> throughout all its parts, declaring that it is <hi>thereby,</hi>
to raiſe them up to ſuch an awakning ſenſe of the exceeding great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their danger, as thereby to provoke them to do their whole
endeavour, and to continue therein to cry to God with great Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
for <hi>Converting Grace,</hi> and to plead his Sacred <hi>Oath,</hi> who hath
<hi>Sworn by himſelf. (As I live, ſaith the Lord, I delight not in the Death
of a Sinner, but had rather he ſhould live and not dye, Ezek.</hi> 33. 11.) And
this moſt plainly appears yet farther, when we conſider how unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God takes it from degenerated <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
that their State was, ſuch as was <hi>without hope, Jer.</hi> 2. 25. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the <hi>Prophet</hi> had juſt before told them their Sin was of a moſt
deep dye, inſomuch that <hi>much Nitre and Soap would not fetch it out,</hi> for
that their <hi>Iniquity was marked before the Lord.</hi> (Jer. 2. 22.) nay and
that their <hi>bruiſe was incurable,</hi> (Ch. 30. 12.) yet for all, there was
Hope.</p>
               <p>Theſe things rightly apprehended, may not only be ſufficient
(if God pleaſe) to Silence and Shame <hi>thoſe Two</hi> Preſumptuous and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105922:11"/>
moſt Confident Perſons, (who call themſelves <hi>The Witneſſes,</hi> and who
make it one chief <hi>Article of their Faith,</hi> (or <hi>Religion</hi>) to believe <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
Immediate and Irrecoverable Destruction,</hi>) but likewiſe to confute
that dangerous <hi>Muggletonian Hereſie,</hi> and to condemn their horrid
Impiety and <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> who paſs their wicked Sentence of <hi>Irrevocable
Damnation,</hi> on whom they pleaſe; ſo oppoſite to the <hi>End</hi> of Gods <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest

the Scripture, making the Silly and Ignorant think <hi>They only,</hi> are

Theſe <hi>Conſiderations</hi> I hope, (through Gods Bleſſing) may <hi>Strengthen,
Comfort</hi> and <hi>Establiſh</hi> many poor <hi>Self-condemning Christians,</hi> who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

we may rightly underſtand how his <hi>Irrevocable Decree</hi> for the <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
of ſome, can conſiſt with <hi>Vnlimited Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> we are
to conſider that it is Grounded upon his <hi>Eternal Fore-knowledge</hi> of the

Judge of all the Earth,</hi> (as <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.) is pleaſed for moſt wiſe
reaſons, (never to be underſtood by us in this World) to <hi>deny</hi> and
<hi>withold Special Sanctifying Grace,</hi> whoſe Sovereign Will and Pleaſure
herein is not the <hi>Real</hi> or <hi>Phyſical Cauſe</hi> of their <hi>final Impenitency,</hi> or
<hi>Damnation,</hi> but only the <hi>Antecedent</hi> to that <hi>Infallible Conſequent,</hi> (as
the <hi>withdrawment</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> is the <hi>Antecedent</hi> of <hi>Darkneſs) Jer.</hi> 2. 17.

               <p>As for Mr. <hi>Ward,</hi> he gives us no one collateral <hi>Sign</hi> or <hi>Token</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
any that he is ſent of God, and raiſed up to be a Prophet, but
toils hard to ſhew us after what manner he came to be Infallibly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
into the good Opinion he hath of his Impulſe, hoping that
then we need no other Confirmation of the Doctrine (or Article of his
Faith) but only his <hi>ipſe dixit,</hi> whereas neither of them ſhew us any

that he hath a firm Belief that <hi>VVard,</hi> (becauſe he ſaid ſo) had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
this Article of his Faith by Divine Inſpiration. If we follow
him hence, we need not much queſtion but he hath been taught to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

               <p>2. Negatively.</p>
               <p>God never, that yet I have obſerved, confirmed one Threatning

1. Whether we conſider them as denounced againſt Gods <hi>backſliden
Church,</hi> we ſee it moſt conſpicuous, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Moſes,</hi> when they had
made and Worſhipped their Golden Calf, <hi>Exod. 32. 10. Let me alone,
that my wrath may wax hot againſt them, and Cenſure them,</hi> (and <hi>Deut.</hi>
9. 14. adds, that <hi>I may blot out their Name from under Heaven;</hi>)
and yet at that time when Immediate and Irrevocable Deſtruction
ſeemed to attend that whole Nation, how Sweetly and Excellently
doth <hi>Moſes</hi> Intercede for them? And Gods Wrath was pacified. So
at other times alſo, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 9. from <hi>verſe</hi> 22. to the end, compared
with <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 10, 11.) Another Inſtance we have in <hi>Phineas, Numb.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> God puts <hi>them</hi> alſo into <hi>the right way of preventing their ruine
Threatned,</hi> Iſa. 13. 6. <hi>VVe would have healed</hi> Babylon, (what? <hi>Babylon,</hi>
that curſed Nation, Sentenced to utter deſolation! Yes this <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,)
but ſhe would not.</hi> Compare with <hi>Jer.</hi> 51. 9. Thus God ſtirs up <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive</hi>
to Repentance, Exhorting them to <hi>turn from their Violence,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Jonah</hi> 3. 2, 8. and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> alſo, even <hi>after</hi> that God had expreſly told
him he had <hi>raiſed him up to ſhew his wondrous Power,</hi> (or Juſtice) <hi>on him
and his Kingdom,</hi> Exod. 9. 16. Compared with <hi>chap.</hi> 10. 3. A Text
greatly to be Noted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> God himſelf expreſſeth very enlarged Bowels towards
theſe his Enemies, even then, when lying under his <hi>Severeſt Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natins.</hi>
One great Inſtance take for all; <hi>Moab</hi> is threatned by Gods
Oath to be made a <hi>Perpetual Deſolation, (Zeph.</hi> 2. 9. yet his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Bowels of Compaſſion yerned towards that great Enemy of his
Church, <hi>Iſaiah 15. 5. ch. 16. 9. Jer.</hi> 48. 31, 32, 36. Texts worthy
to be Engraven in Letters of Gold and fixed in us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> God draws out the <hi>Prophets</hi> Heart to Mourn over <hi>them</hi>
at the ſame time, when lying under his <hi>Severeſt Doom,</hi> that they may
be taught how to mourn for their own Sins and <hi>Repent,</hi> and <hi>eſcape</hi> the
Deſolation threatned; thus for <hi>Tyre, Ezek.</hi> 27. 1, 31. for <hi>Egypt. Ezek.</hi>

NOW from the whole, it is not difficult for any conſidering Perſon
to <hi>Conjecture</hi> by what Spirit <hi>Ward</hi> and <hi>Evans</hi> do Act in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
for they are far from ſtirring up themſelves or others to Pray and
Faſt, and Wreſtle for our poor ſinful <hi>Land,</hi> (which they have thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully
Sentenced to unavoidable Deſtruction,) that they ſeem
reſolved to <hi>Pawn all the hopes and expectations they have of Salvation,</hi>
(or all the Religion they have) as a certain <hi>Pledg,</hi> that <hi>God will not
give Repentance to</hi> England, though they ſhould ſeek it never ſo fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently;
nay more, that his moſt Sacred <hi>Oath</hi> is gone forth, (without
an <hi>If</hi>) that they may thereby <hi>Infallibly</hi> be aſſured God hath made an
<hi>Irrevocable Decree</hi> for our <hi>Immediate Deſtruction.</hi> Now let any judge,
Doth not theſe Mens <hi>Faith</hi> teach us all to caſt our ſelves into a <hi>Helliſh
Plunge of Deſperation,</hi> and thereby to become Seven-fold more the
<hi>Children of the Devil</hi> than now <hi>we are?</hi> Doth not it teach flat <hi>Rebellion</hi>
againſt God, and the whole <hi>Tenor of his VVord,</hi> who <hi>Commands</hi> us all
to <hi>Trust in him at all Times,</hi> and to <hi>Pour out our Souls before him</hi> in the
worſt condition we can be in? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 8. And <hi>always to Pray and not
faint,</hi> Luke 18. 1. compar'd with <hi>Job 35. 14. Judgment is before him,
therefore trust thou in him,</hi> which Text is excellently explained
<hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 24.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Scripture</hi> in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 14. may be Objected—<hi>Though</hi> Noah,
Daniel <hi>or</hi> Job <hi>were in it, yet they ſhould deliver but their own Souls.
Anſw.</hi> 1. We all know, God ſometimes makes a plain diſcovery of
<hi>a limited Period</hi> for his Mercy to a <hi>City</hi> or <hi>People</hi> with this <hi>Prov ſo,</hi> That
if they <hi>Repent</hi> not <hi>in that time</hi> they ſhall be <hi>Deſtroyed.</hi> But where do
any prove that <hi>this preſent Year is</hi> Englands <hi>laſt Period</hi> for continued
Mercy? <hi>Conjectures</hi> are many, (perhaps) but we muſt not Build our
<hi>Faith</hi> on <hi>Impreſſions</hi> or <hi>Impulſes,</hi> and Idolize our own Apprehenſions.
<hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. If we <hi>attentively conſider</hi> the aforementioned <hi>Text,</hi> we may
find how much we all lie under a <hi>Vulgar mistake,</hi> for that <hi>Scripture</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
repeats it, that we might take a particular notice thereof, and
not run into a dangerous <hi>Error.</hi> God there tells us plainly, (and no
more that yet I learn) <hi>viz. That when he is ſo highly provoked with a
Nation, as to <hi>Begin</hi> to bring his Deſolating Judgments thereon,</hi> (or in the
Scripture words, when his <hi>Decree hath begun to bring forth</hi>) it may
<hi>ſometimes ſo happen,</hi> [though it ſeems not to be a conſtant General and
Infallible Rule, as in the Caſe of <hi>Phineas</hi> Interceſſion, when the
<hi>Plague</hi> was begun, and other Inſtances] <hi>That he will not hear the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of his greatest Favourites, but will proceed to destroy;</hi> And if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
that harder <hi>Text</hi> be Objected in <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 1. It is as eaſily.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105922:16"/>
Anſwer'd. For <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> Deſtruction was thereby foretold in all the
appearance of <hi>Irrevocable Judgment,</hi> and yet (as was before obſerv'd
in the 4th. Note under the 1ſt. Conſideration) notwithſtanding all, if
<hi>Zedekiah</hi> had gone forth to meet the <hi>King of</hi> Babylon's <hi>Princes,</hi> the
City had certainly not been deſtroyed by the <hi>Babylonians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. Our plain <hi>Rule</hi> is this, That <hi>none ought to conclude their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
or the State of any Nation or People ſo deſperate, as to be exempted
from all hope of Mercy, or Salvation, no though God poſſibly Denounceth
Destruction, and prefixeth a very ſpeedy Time, or Day, without any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
limited:</hi> As that Famous Inſtance in <hi>Ninive</hi> may ſerve once for
all. There God had Twice declared it poſitively, that <hi>within Forty
Days</hi> that City ſhould be Deſtroyed, firſt to <hi>Jonah</hi> before his Storm,
(<hi>Jonah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 1. 2. compared with <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 2.) and afterwards:</p>
               <p>It may be <hi>Asked,</hi> whether, if <hi>Immediate Destruction</hi> ſhould come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>England,</hi> will not this plainly Evidence theſe Two Men were <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely
Inſpired,</hi> and ſent by God? <hi>Anſw.</hi> This will no more prove
they have <hi>the Spirit of Propheſy,</hi> and are immediately ſent by <hi>God,</hi>
than it proves that any <hi>Miniſter</hi> hath that Divine <hi>Gift</hi> in an Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
manner, becauſe he publiſheth he <hi>Verily Believes,</hi> (or is fully
perſuaded <hi>ſome ſudden Judgment is coming upon us,</hi>) and yet I make
not this an <hi>Article</hi> of my Faith, and leaſt of all, to believe we are in
a Remedileſs Condition, (<hi>For with God all things ſhall be poſſible unto
them that believe.</hi>) And how many <hi>Philonides</hi> are their amongſt us,
who need no <hi>Extraordinary Inſpiration,</hi> to make them believe the
ſame?</p>
               <p>But to draw the Eyes of all Men upon <hi>them,</hi> as Extraordinary
Prophets of God, raiſed up to denounce againſt <hi>England,</hi> a deſolating
Judgment <hi>Immediately</hi> and <hi>Irrevocably</hi> falling on us, is ſuch a <hi>Secret,</hi>
as if God intends to accompliſh the ſame, yet perhaps he hath not
