            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">The Particulars are more at large contained in the BOOK under-mentioned, referred to in the Margent.</head>

            <p n="II">It ſtiffens a Ship ſo that ſhe will carry more Sail, which will alſo accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate her motion.</p>

            <p n="IV">The great Nails in a Wood-ſheathing muſt be very deſtructive to the Plank; for when they ſtrip that Sheathing, they are fain to ſpyle up the Nail-holes with Pegs of Wood, whereas the ſmall Nails of a Lead-ſheathing does the Plank no harm.</p>

               <note n="*" place="margin">P. 38. 41. 76. 80.</note> It is owned not to foul ſo much as a Wood-ſheathing; and when foul, eaſier cleaned.</p>
            <p n="VI">Laſtly, The Lead-ſheathing being Metal, which the Worm cannot enter, it muſt be a certain ſecurity againſt it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it is above</hi> Cent. per Cent. Cheaper, <hi>plainly appears as follows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SUppoſe that an ordinary Streights-ſheathing will coſt 10 <hi>d.</hi> a Foot ſquare (a good <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Sheathing near three times as much) and that ſuch a Sheath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laſts not above a Voyage or two; but, for more abundant proof, let it be granted that one ſuch Sheathing would laſt ſeven Years, and that the Charge of Graving upon that Sheathing (ſuppoſe for a Ship of 600 Tun, which would mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure 5400 Foot ſquare) would coſt but 45 <hi>l.</hi> a-year, (which will probably be above 55 <hi>l.</hi>) this in ſeven Years, with the Sheathing at 10 <hi>d.</hi> a-foot, would coſt 540 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:154178:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p n="2">Suppoſe alſo that a <hi>Mill'd Lead</hi> Sheathing ſhould be ſtripp'd at ſeven years end, <note n="†" place="margin">P. 27.</note> which for any defect in the Sheathing it ſelf (as Experience hath ſhewn) may laſt twice as long, if the Ship's Caulking, driving of her Bolts, or other Repairs, don't require it: And that ſuch a Sheathing for the ſame Ship would coſt 15 <hi>d.</hi> a foot, let there be deducted but ¼ for the Old Sheathing when ſtripp'd; which, being Metal, muſt yield more than that to melt down again, this Lead-ſheathing would ſtand the Owner but in 253 <hi>l.</hi> 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> which is <hi>Cent. per Cent.</hi> ſaved, and 33 <hi>l.</hi> 15 <hi>s.</hi> to ſpare, probably more than it will require to repair acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental rubbs all the time; and when any ſuch thing happens, a ſmall quantity of the Lead and Nails, being reſerved on board, any one may mend as Opportunity offers.</p>
            <p n="3">There is nothing more required, over or under this Sheathing, but to have the Plank well brimm'd, <note place="margin">P. 41. 76, 77.</note> and the Seams well caulked, at firſt bringing on, and ſome long handled Briſtle-bruſhes provided on board to clean it once in two or three Months, as occaſion offers. Tallowing, that has been ſometimes uſed, was never propoſed by the Inventors, they conceiving the <hi>Lead-ſheathing</hi> would keep longer clean without it.</p>

               </note> tho' if it did, 'tis ſufficiently repaid in the ſeven years time; but deducting only 55 <hi>l.</hi> for the Old Sheathing, allowing ſeven Years rebate for its preſent value, and it will appear not 4 <hi>per Cent.</hi> more than that at firſt charge with once graving.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A ſhort Account of the Beginning and Progreſs of the</hi> Mill'd-Lead <hi>Sheathing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THis Invention was begun upon an Act of Parliament, by the countenance and encouragement of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. who very well underſtood Shipping, and <note n="*" place="margin">P. 22. <hi>Of the Letter.</hi>
               </note> promiſed himſelf great Matters from it, and had not been deceived if it had met with due encouragement for all the Services it was qualified; particularly for <note n="†" place="margin">Vide <hi>Purſers Certificates. P. 83.</hi>
               </note> lyning of Bread-rooms, where, after it had been ſome time uſed (inſtead of Plates of Laten or Tin, which coſt more, and, being made of Iron ſoon ruſted and decay'd) it was laid aſide again, upon pretence that there was a dampneſs and moiſture diſcovered in the <hi>Lead</hi> it ſelf, which they found did corrupt and ſpoil the Bisquet; although 'tis well known, eſpecially to Merchants, that nothing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves any Proviſions or Goods, they put therein for their long Voyages, ſweeter and better than Lead inſtead of. The Earl of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> when he went Governor of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> carried over with him ſeveral Deal-boxes lyned with <hi>Mill'd-Lead,</hi> wherein he put Corn, Meal, Gunpowder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> intending them for Water-Ciſterns afterwards, from whom and Sir <hi>Henry Morgan</hi> Letters came to Sir <hi>Philip Howard,</hi> that the Corn and Meal was preſerved ſweet in thoſe Boxes, when the reſt of the ſame ſort that was in Cask was muſty, and the Gunpowder dry, and a ſixth part of more force upon Trial than the ſame ſort in Barrels: And alſo for Scuppers, wherein not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the <note n="†" place="margin">P. 114.</note> Evidence upon the Trials made in 1678. by that Board's Order the ſame was diſcontinued till the preſent Navy board being ſatisfied upon <note n="*" place="margin">P, 116.</note> new Trials by them ordered in 1691. were pleaſed to reſtore it to uſe again, at Rates above <hi>90 per Cent.</hi> leſs charge to the King, than the former Scuppers for the ſame Service had coſt him, though they might reaſonably have allowed the Propoſer ſomething more for his Encouragement, and ſaved the King enough by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
            <p>The firſt Ship was ſheathed by his Majeſty's Direction, <hi>March 10 1670.</hi> and ſoon after many more: But it quickly found great oppoſition, and continual Complaints and Objections, raiſed by the Artifice of Perſons intereſted to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it; <hi>viz.</hi> that it would rub off by Cables, Hawſers, lying on ground, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that the Navy-Board deferred entring into any formal Contract for it, till they had taken time enough to be fully ſatisfied therein; and after five Years Trial upon ten Ships, which had been ſheathed within that time, they then (as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:154178:4"/>in the Preamble of their Contract) upon <note n="†" place="margin">P. 8. 73, 74, 75, 76.</note> ſufficient Proof and Experience, entred into a Contract with the Parties concerned for the whole time of their Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Afterwards about half a ſcore Ships more were ſheathed in two or three. Years time, when a new Complaint was raiſed from abroad by Letters from <note n="*" place="margin">P. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.</note> ſome Captains and Commanders of <hi>Lead-ſheathed</hi> Ships, that there was ſome venemous Quality diſcovered in the <hi>Lead ſheathing,</hi> that did in a very extraordinary manner eat and corrode the Bolts and <hi>Rudder-Irons,</hi> which took ſuch impreſſion in that Navy-Board, notwithſtanding all Reaſons offered to the contrary, that they (<note n="†" place="margin">Octob. 28. 1682.</note> ſome time afterwards) reported the thing to the then Lords of the Admiralty, as true, and adviſed the ſtripping off the <hi>Lead-ſheathing</hi> as ſoon as the Ships came home, to which Report the <hi>Mill'd-Lead</hi> Company (when they heard of it, having obtained a Copy) put in their Anſwer, both which were by my Lord <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham,</hi> one of thoſe Commiſſioners, and alſo a Privy-Counſellor, laid before the King and Council, and by them upon Hearing (the Particulars being many) referred back again to the Lords of the Admiralty to examine and report their Opinions; but that Admiralty Commiſſion being determined before any Report could be obtained, this Sheathing has been diſcontinued in the Navy ever ſince, <note n="†" place="margin">P. 40. 41.</note> upon no other ground but barely upon its ſuppoſed extraordinary eating and corroding the <hi>Rudder-Irons,</hi> all other Complaints being cleared as aboveſaid, and nothing more now objected in their ſaid Report, which ſhewed their full ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in all other Matters, but what related to the Bolts and <hi>Rudder-Irons</hi> only.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Obſ.</note> It may be obſerved upon this laſt Paragraph, without Reflection upon the Commanders, that the Shipwrights here having furniſhed their Brethren the Carpenters, on Board thoſe Ships, with Inſtructions from the ruſty diſcolouring of the Lead, mixing with the Filth about the Braces of the <hi>Rudder</hi> and Bolt-heads (by the Salt Waters gleeting from the Iron-work beneath <note n="*" place="margin">P. 25. 26.</note> being not parcelled as it ought to have been) it may be thought no great difficulty (eſpecially if the <hi>Rudder-Irons</hi> happen'd to be much eaten) for theſe Carpenters (whoſe proper Buſineſs this is) to impoſe upon the Captain by poſitive Aſſertions, that they never knew <hi>Rudder-Irons</hi> ſo much eaten in ſo ſhort a time, and might name ſome upon other Ships that were much better; and perſwade him (from this unuſual Colour about the Iron work) that it muſt be ſome poiſonous or corroding Quality in the <hi>Lead-ſheathing</hi> that has thus extraordinarily eaten his <hi>Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Irons;</hi> which ſeeming plauſible to him, at length he believes, and writes ſo to the Navy-Board, and afterwards, perhaps, thinks himſelf bound in Honour to maintain it, what Reaſons ſoever are offered to the contrary.</p>
