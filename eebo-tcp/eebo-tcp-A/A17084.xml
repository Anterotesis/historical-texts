         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And for a more probation thereof he addeth. I wolde all men were as I my selfe am, but the Apostle wolde not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue wysshed for all, the thynge that col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de by no meanes agre to al, or disagre to Gods bountyfull goodnes, that he shold geue it to some only with respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte of parsonnes, whiche he spake by the Apostles mouthe to be expedyent for all men.</p>

But euerie man hathe hys proper gift of God, one after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner an other after that, and immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye after.

            <p>Uvhich when Uvinchester interpre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth of him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is now already maried, &amp; saith that it is good for such an one to touche his wyfe, if she also agre not to vnmaried state.

Uynchester therfor after his

            <p>Also if Paule had not added suche an euident and oft recited exposytyon after thys hys saynge vndeterminate. Yet by thes wordes (I wolde all men were, as I my selfe ame) it colde not be gathered, that abstinence therfor shold be such a gift whiche God of hys in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fynyte bountie sholde geue vnto all, vnlesse he wylbe counted parciale, and to haue respect of parsons.

Hereof therfor (yf Uyinchesters argumet be trew) we may conclude that all they whiche onlye put to theyr

wyll and praye, maye receaue the gift of tunges &amp; prophecie of GOD. And that it is contrarie to Gods bountyful goodnes to geue that thinge to certai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne with respecte of parsons, whiche he hath spoken by the Apostles mouthe so manifestlye to be good and worthie to be desyred for of all men. But the holy ghost spake by Paul y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he distribu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth his giftes as he thinketh mete and that without respect of parsons.

For when the Apostle had wisshed chastitie vnto all, he added a moderation of this his generall wishe, whiche after the wyshe of prophecye he did not.

            <p>Understande ye therfore of thys thinges, which I haue brought owt of his owne hand writinge.

<pb facs="tcp:6334:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Afterwarde, that he hath inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted this place of the necessitie to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the doughter, and not to kepe her. Last of alle concerninge the necess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Furthermore this same interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Photius, concerninge the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sytie to kepe the doughter whyche he graunteth to be longe no lesse proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to this place of Paule, then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he spake of before.

            <p>To be short, besydes this, that he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugneth so greatlye, and so shameful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye rebuketh this interpretation, no more owrs and Photius ys.

virginitie is a thynge vuluntarye and not vnuoluntary.

            <p>And so by this it is manifeste that the interpretation whiche we alleaged vpon this place of Paule (And hath no nede) is knowen and geuen as the verye proper and peculier interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation both by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles very words and also by the trew author therof, the holye ghost, and taken of all that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprete it anye thinge to the purpose both olde and newe: Yea and euen of Photius him selfe whom Uvinchester brought against vs with suche a super<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>celyous and proude preiudice, as a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of all the olde antiquitie.<note place="margin">Uvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesters mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest vani<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie.</note>

he dare write, that we are thonlye au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thores of this interpretation, and that it is oure inuention and faiuinge: but also to be a detestable babler and railer against the trewthe, and the reuerent antiquitie of holye fathers for bycawse thos his scoldinges and raylinges (of a foolyshe interpretation, colde peruerse not agreable to the Apostles wordes, and cleane con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

            <p>It appeareth not (saith he) yf we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue this sense what ambiguitie or doubt the Apostle made plaine here with so manie wordes and so waighty
<pb facs="tcp:6334:66"/>
(Yf anie think that it is vncomelye for his vyrgin &amp;c.) or to what dowbt he answered the Corinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.

Also (he saith) the Apostle myght haue spoken that we interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, yf he had minded to teache it, in more open and lesse wordes, to saye. Let the father kepe his virgin, yf she be dysposed to lyue in her virginitie: Yf not, let hym marye her, wheras (yf we wyll ascribe oure sense to the Apostle) he sholde seeme to haue vsed an obscu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re tumblynge together of wordes, and farr from the purposed matter, and to speake wordes in vayne and wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sense. On this fassyon doth Uvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester reason in two of his writinges, in his hande writinge that he sent me and in the fyrst imprinted.</p>

chastitie of others, which began to pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fesse chastitie, were cleane against this new studye of chastitie emonge them, and perceaued thys kynde of lyuynge to be other litle worthy, or not very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for Christians. Lyke as not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelye the wise men of the world, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me certayne of the Corinthians as yet yonglynges in Christ, &amp; carnall, made more of, then it behoueth, but also the Hebrues whiche professed the doctrine of God, rebuked chastitie, and praysed matrimony.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which remayned vnmaryed after theyr leful age to mary, yf it were not for the cause to learne Gods lawe, to be gilty of the cryme of bloud, sheddin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge, and of the diminisshyng of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye and honour of God emong the pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ople of Israel, and therfor vnworthy to be suffered emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g Gods people.
