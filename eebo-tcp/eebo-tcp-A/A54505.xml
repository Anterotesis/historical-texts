            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>REverend <hi>Sirs,</hi> behold now, the <hi>proposer</hi> of this <hi>Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> hath taken upon him to interrogate your <hi>General Assembly</hi> a word in the <hi>cause</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>people,</hi> even as <hi>cause</hi> hath seemed to require; knowing well how much it behoveth, and becometh all those that make mention of the <hi>Lord,</hi> not to keep silence in the day of <hi>Jacobs</hi> trouble; if a necessary <hi>word</hi> seasonably spoken, may become any way instrumental, unto the <hi>breaking forth</hi> of <hi>light</hi> in these days of <hi>darkness</hi> and <hi>gloominess;</hi> days of <hi>clouds,</hi> and <hi>thick darkness:</hi> And seeing <hi>God</hi> doth not altogether hide from <hi>seeing eyes,</hi> and <hi>hearing ears,</hi> and <hi>understanding hearts,</hi> what he is about to do:

The wonderful and unwonted daily <hi>occurrences,</hi> do seemingly declare, That the <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>hosts</hi> is doing his <hi>work,</hi> his strange <hi>work;</hi> and bringing to pass his <hi>act,</hi> his strange <hi>act</hi> of removing the <hi>Diadem,</hi> and taking off the <hi>Crown,</hi> overturning, overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, overturning it, that it may be no more, in as much as the <hi>horrid</hi> and <hi>grievous sin</hi> of <hi>Tyranny</hi> hath found out the <hi>guilty, capital Delinquents;</hi> to allude to that which is prophetically denounced, see <hi>Ezek. 21. 25, 26, 27. God</hi> thus thundering and speaking as it were from <hi>Heaven;</hi> who can but tremblingly speak? If children should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out?</p>
                     <p>Hence the said <hi>proposer</hi> hath taken upon him also, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound a few words unto your learned and solid <hi>wisdoms,</hi> who are the <hi>choice</hi> and <hi>eminent Commissioners</hi> of your <hi>General Assembly,</hi> and to pray you of your <hi>gentleness,</hi> to hear with <hi>patience,</hi> some <hi>advertisement,</hi> for the stirring you up to <hi>contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute</hi> your best <hi>assistance</hi> in this <hi>perplexed, conjuncture</hi> of <hi>Affairs</hi> in our three <hi>Nations,</hi> in helping the <hi>Lord</hi> against his opposites.</p>
                     <p>Right worthy <hi>Sirs,</hi> It manifestly appeareth by the <hi>return</hi> of the <hi>hearty thanks</hi> of the <hi>Estates</hi> of your <hi>Parliament,</hi> for your <hi>Testimony</hi> against <hi>Toleration;</hi> and likewise their <hi>concurrence</hi> with it; that ye have <hi>singular interest</hi> in the <hi>Estates</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> May it please you therefore, to <hi>improve</hi> your <hi>interest,</hi> by <hi>suggesting</hi> and <hi>perswading</hi> them (that whereas this your <hi>Parliament</hi> was extraordinarily summoned, and the <hi>form</hi> and <hi>frame,</hi> or <hi>materials</hi> in <hi>great part,</hi> regulated by such of the <hi>Estates</hi> and <hi>Souldieries,</hi> who sought the <hi>real welfare</hi> of your <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Nation,</hi> in the extream <hi>exigencies</hi> thereof, without the <hi>command</hi> or <hi>direction</hi> of any legal <hi>Monarch,</hi> to give order thereabouts, and as indeed your <hi>case</hi> seemed absolutely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire) they would now deeply <hi>ponder,</hi> and <hi>bethink themselves</hi> of the <hi>best expedient</hi> for the <hi>settlement</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> as may tend to the lengthening of your <hi>tranquillity,</hi> in the <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>true Religion,</hi> and also <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> and <hi>Civil Government,</hi> for the suppressing of <hi>Popery, Prelacy,.

Hushai</hi> his speech (who was a great Counsellor of <hi>State)</hi> seemeth to be a reasonable and just political <hi>Maxime; viz.

And to say nothing what <hi>humane writings</hi> tell us, touching <hi>political Government</hi> in its kindes or species; as likewise, touching their <hi>rules</hi> given in the main of them practicable in any kinde of <hi>lawful policy;</hi> whether it be <hi>Monarchical, Aristocratical, Democratical,</hi> or mixt of these.


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57165:14"/>
Nor yet to say nothing of <hi>Church Government,</hi> by <hi>Presbyteries</hi> and <hi>Synods,</hi> in any <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> as being directed unto, in the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and is therefore unchangeable <hi>(de jure)</hi> in the <hi>substantials</hi> of it, in all ages and times of the <hi>Church.</hi> That which is to be remembred and taken notice of, is touching <hi>Political Government</hi> of <hi>Common-wealths;</hi> which according to the <hi>divine story</hi> in <hi>Scripture,</hi> written for our learning, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4. hath been variously changeable, in various <hi>ages</hi> and <hi>periods</hi> of <hi>times. viz.</hi> From <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> it was in one kinde, even by <hi>Patriarks;</hi> from <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Samuel,</hi> it was in other kindes, even by <hi>Moses, Joshua, Elders, Heads</hi> of <hi>Tribes,</hi> and <hi>Judges;</hi> from <hi>Samuel,</hi> until the Captivities of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> it was again in other kindes, even by <hi>Kings,</hi> variously promoted unto the <hi>Government</hi> by <hi>Gods</hi> designe, <hi>viz.</hi> Either <hi>elected</hi> by the people, or by <hi>descent</hi> approved amongst the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or by <hi>conquests;</hi> from the <hi>return</hi> of the <hi>Jewish captivity,</hi> until <hi>new Testament</hi> times, it was yet in other kindes, even by <hi>Princes, Governors, Captains,</hi> or <hi>Roman Deputies;</hi> and the same <hi>judicial, penal Laws,</hi> of <hi>divine institution</hi> and <hi>enacting,</hi> did equally and respectively serve in one kinde of <hi>Government,</hi> as well as another; for the preservation of <hi>life, livelihood,</hi> and <hi>liberty,</hi> in a due way of <hi>administration.</hi> So that such passages of <hi>Scripture,</hi> well observed and remembred, it may seem, That our <hi>Lord Christ</hi> is no more a <hi>friend</hi> to <hi>Monarchical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> then to <hi>Aristocratical,</hi> or <hi>Democratical,</hi> or mixt of any of these. Moreover, let it also be remembred, That after the <hi>return</hi> from the <hi>captivity,</hi> when preceding <hi>Monarchy</hi> had ceased (and yet <hi>Jacobs Prophetical prediction</hi> failed not, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 10.) and the <hi>Government</hi> was changed through <hi>divine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation</hi> of <hi>times</hi> and <hi>seasons</hi> which the <hi>Father</hi> hath put in his own power; yet such after-<hi>Government,</hi> did flourish and prosper greatly: And although the <hi>external pomp</hi> and <hi>splendor</hi> of the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> was not in all things so <hi>illustrious,</hi> as formerly at some times; by how much a <hi>deficiency</hi> was of some <hi>special means</hi> and <hi>accommodations,</hi> as had been for the structure of <hi>Solomons Temple,</hi> and magnificent <hi>Kingly Palaces, &amp;c.</hi> Yet the latter <hi>condition,</hi> both of the <hi>Temple</hi> re-edified, and

True it is, when <hi>strange</hi> and <hi>sudden changes</hi> do happen in the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Nations;</hi> it is no great marvel, if mens <hi>spirits</hi> be much moved, and greatly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. If the good and grave Prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi> did mourn for King <hi>Saul</hi> in such sort, as he did (and yet <hi>God</hi> himself did therefore reprove him, see 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 1.) yea, when he was rejected from being <hi>King,</hi> for his disobeying <hi>God,</hi> and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people unworthily: It is the less to be wondred at, if the <hi>Scots,</hi> after a <hi>succession</hi> of 107 <hi>Kings,</hi> a <hi>total eclipse</hi> ensuing, or like to ensue, should be exceedingly moved in their <hi>mindes.</hi> But however it may be, may not the <hi>same reproof</hi> and <hi>complaint</hi> be applyed to them, as was to <hi>Samuel</hi> for his mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for <hi>Saul?</hi> when now a <hi>door</hi> of <hi>hope,</hi> as it were in the <hi>valley</hi> of <hi>Achor,</hi> is opened for the taking away of the <hi>offender</hi> and <hi>troubler</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> for the better fruition of <hi>just freedom.

                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is taken for granted, That the <hi>contrivers, urgers,</hi> and <hi>takers</hi> of the <hi>Solemn League</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> did <hi>mean, endevor,</hi> and <hi>act,</hi> according to the <hi>sacred conditions</hi> of an <hi>Oath,</hi> prescribed in <hi>Jerem. 4 2.

                     <p n="4">4. In the <hi>preamble</hi> unto the taking of it, it is expressed, That the end of the <hi>Covenant</hi> (as a last <hi>refuge)</hi> was the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation</hi> of the <hi>takers</hi> of it, and their <hi>Religion</hi> from <hi>utter ruine</hi> and <hi>destruction.</hi> So that the six particular <hi>Articles</hi> of it, were <hi>intended</hi> and <hi>pretended</hi> to have a <hi>tendency</hi> to such an end, and not otherwise. Now such hath been the <hi>end,</hi> and hereunto have served the <hi>means</hi> of the <hi>defendants</hi> in this case.

It is required, That the <hi>Ministers</hi> who were appointed to tender it, should read it, and then explain it, and then perswade to the taking of it. This <hi>Order</hi> seemeth to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, not onely a <hi>necessity</hi> of the explaining of it, but also a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitness</hi> in so taking of it, as explained in its <hi>just sense,</hi> and <hi>latitude,</hi> and <hi>end,</hi> and not otherwise And this also is the <hi>plea</hi> of the <hi>Covenanters,</hi> honestly and uprightly disposed; as all must needs acknowledg.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Whereas the <hi>title</hi> prefixed unto the <hi>Covenant,</hi> is, <hi>A So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn League and Covenant, for Reformation and defence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the honor and happiness of the King, and the Peace, and


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57165:17"/>
Safety of the three Kingdoms of</hi> England, Scotland, <hi>and</hi> Ireland. The explanation must needs be, That such <hi>Reformation</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi> ought to be prosecuted, in <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>just ways,</hi> and <hi>means,</hi> for the accomplishment thereof, and not otherwise. And in this <hi>sense,</hi> no doubt the faithful <hi>Covenanters</hi> have taken it.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. It must needs be understood rationally, That the <hi>course</hi> for the <hi>due</hi> accomplishing of what is in the <hi>title,</hi> or more full expression of the six <hi>Articles</hi> of it, ought to have their <hi>mutual consistency,</hi> without any prejudice to any of the <hi>particulars;</hi> whether they be <hi>absolute,</hi> or <hi>conditional</hi> onely; whether they be <hi>primary,</hi> or <hi>subservient</hi> onely. Our <hi>Lord Christs</hi> vindicating of his <hi>Disciples,</hi> touching the keeping of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> against the <hi>calumnies</hi> and <hi>exceptions</hi> of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> see <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 1, 2, 9. may vindicate the <hi>objected</hi> against, in the case in hand.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Touching the <hi>endevor Covenanted</hi> in the first and second <hi>Articles,</hi> it is charitably hoped, That all the <hi>takers</hi> of it, have complied therein, more or less, according to their <hi>calling, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,</hi> and <hi>opportunity</hi> thereunto. Every one <hi>standeth</hi> or <hi>falleth</hi> to his own <hi>master;</hi> howbeit, it is most probably conjectured, That such <hi>Parliamenteers,</hi> and their <hi>adherents,</hi> who <hi>voted</hi> against the <hi>Concessions</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> in the <hi>treaty</hi> at <hi>Newport,</hi> in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> as no <hi>just ground</hi> and <hi>foundation</hi> for a good <hi>Peace;</hi> argued thereby much <hi>faithfulness</hi> to the <hi>Covenant.</hi> Ye your selves acknowledg, <hi>Testim. against Tol. pag.</hi> 12, That those <hi>Concessions,</hi> if <hi>acquiesced</hi> in, were <hi>danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> and <hi>destructive,</hi> both to <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Covenant.</hi>
