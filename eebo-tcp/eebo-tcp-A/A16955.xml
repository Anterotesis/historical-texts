            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Riſtotle the wittie philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi>
(right Honorable) noteth, that as
the eyes of Battes are affected towardes
the light in the day: ſo is the minde of
our ſoule to thoſe things, which of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are verie manifeſt.</p>
            <p>That appeareth in all our ſtudies: wherein, after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
yeeres paines, we get but that which in the ende we
ſee to haue been cleere in the firſt, if our eyes had been
opened to behold them: and finde that we may ſoone
ſhewe vnto others, manifolde obſcure points quicklie,
which our ſelues were long in ſearching.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip by experience in my ſtudies, may bee
a fit example herein. For, whereas I ſpent manie yeeres
labour in ſearching the Concent of holy Writers, which
haue penned for vs the Booke of Truth, cleering the
Prophecies vnto their euents, through the right Famy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
and courſe of times, and to compell other Hebrewes
and Greekes to ſerue them: your Lordſhip learned after
little direction, that which I could not finde in paines of
long continuance: and that no leſſe for Scripture, than
for old Heathen ſtories.</p>
            <p>And euen as I was long in contriuing of them into an
order, which ſoone might haue been ſeene: ſo others, in
<pb facs="tcp:7086:3"/>
ſtudie my Ancients, of great fame and deſert, for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
triable by ey-ſight (and thereupon euident vnto all,
who will reſt vpon Gods authoritie) either will not, or
can not ſee that, which now I beholde as cleere as the
Sunne in his greateſt brightnes: and I knowe that your
Lordſhip doth no leſſe.</p>
            <p>Yea, who would not be our ſuretie? when the ſtriuer
is confuted with the verie title of the Defence, THAT
CHRIST our Lord died in the time properly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
to Daniel. Alſo, who would not acknowledge the
weaknes of mans minde, when this Apologie is found
extreamely needfull, for satisfaction of ſome Students
in both Vniuerſities? One learned man of the one V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſitie
told mee, that an aduerſarie had turned all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
mee, all of all degrees: in ſo cleere a caſe, that hee
preſently was driuen to yeeld vnto mee, as ſoone as he
heard the proprietie for which wee ſtroue. For when I
told him of Gabriels prophecie, I asked him, whence the
time muſt be counted, and whether? He ſaid, from the
ſpeaking, and vnto our Lord his death. I bad him tell
their D. that he muſt doo ſo too. So he doth, ſo he yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vnto mee, ſo our cauſe had been determined by the
ſtriuer, if the blindnes of ſome had not ben meruailous:
who hauing loſt their hold, (not three daies before they
perceiue it, as the Babylonians) but three yeeres, yet tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
of a victorie: ſo that ſome of the other Vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
began a little to triumph with them. Hereupon this
Apologie I write in defence of my ſelfe, of Daniell the
wiſe, of Gabriel the angell, and of mine Aduerſarie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
himſelfe: that the middle ſpace cannot by religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
learning, arte, or wit, be holden vncertaine: neither
hath he Heathen concent anie thing worth, but in the
parts deſpiſed, by all Writers vpon the Prophetes and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
and alſo by prophane Greekes, the moſt ancient,
<pb facs="tcp:7086:3"/>
and the lateſt. Theſe two poynts end the controuerſie.
I commend to your Lordſhippes protection my cauſe:
which (I thinke) ſhall more neede authoritie, than skill
to defend it. Art careth not for the manie of Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:
yet to bridle manie ſtriuers vnſeaſonable and
vnreaſonable, authoritie of high perſonages,
(who priuately maye deale) is now
for mee ſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite.</p>

               <p>12 It were ſtrange that Aggai ſhoulde in fiue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies

               <p>16 The people were generally ſo tractable vnder

               <p>18 Nehemias demaunded in what caſe they were
at Ieruſalem which were the remnant of the captiuitye:
in the 20. yeare of Artaxerxes. wherfore the ſpace thence
to Cyrus was ſuch as mans age from the captiuity might
yet fuffer ſome good ſort aliue.</p>
               <p>19 If Ieruſalem had bin vnwalled aboue 120. yeares,
<pb facs="tcp:7086:12"/>
Nehemias would not, as he did, take a ſodaine griefe, for
ſo ſtale a matter. But for ſeauen ſeauens now ending, and
touched by Gabriel for the building of Ieruſalem, he
might by iuſt lykelihoode take a griefe.</p>

foorth of the word vnto building of Ieruſalem, and
thence vnto our Lordes healtie paſſion, muſt not onelie
make vp the whole, but muſt haue ſome cleere reaſon
for the firſt and laſt part: otherwiſe the partition had bin
without iudgement. But for the laſt part: a defender in
common conſent is needleſſe: wherefore the troubler
of the firſt part ſhould ſeeme troubleſome, againſt art.</p>
               <p>20 That Nehemias had relation to Gabriel for buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of Ieruſalem (for which worke ſeauen ſeauens are
ſet a parte Dan. 9.) the whole imitation of Daniels prayer
which Nehemias followeth, more then euer Virgil
followed Homer, or Tully Demoſthenes, that imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
maketh plaine, that to Daniels Chronicle he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <p>21 No other reaſon can be rendred, why 49. yeares
ſhould be ſpoken of alone Dan. 9. but for the time of the

               <p>This being heard was tolde unto the Peloponneſians. They
miſtruſting the oracle, ſende againe by a common decree, to aske
more diligently of Apollo concerning the oracles. The Pythia
ſpeaketh thus:
<q>
                     <l>O Peloponneſus dwellers, goe about your altars,</l>
                     <l>Sacrifice and obey all your Mantes commandements:</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>After theſe Oracles, the Peloponneſians ſuffred the men of Elis
to diſpoſe the Olympia, and to proclaime a truce to the cities. And
when afterwardes the Eleans would have holpen the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians

               </q>
               <p>After theſe oracles they ſure ceaſed from warre: and looked to
the Olympikes, and for five Olympiades no man was crowned. In
the ſixt, they thought good to aske the oracle whether the victories
ſhould be crowned: and they ſend King Iphitus to that Chappell.
Then ſhee looſed her mouth into theſe wordes.</p>

be aboue 300.<note place="margin">For Iphitus is the tenth from Hercules. Now by Herodotus and Clemens, three generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wyll not go aboue 100. yeeres.</note> yeeres after Troyes fall: or rather

who placeth Lycurgus at 300. after Priamus

Phlegon one hundreth yeere in foure: whereby alſo

               <p>2 This euident caſe moued me to accuſe Olympiades
of ſo great deceyte, whereby Chriſtians haue been
conuicted to make for the very ſame age neare double
ſo many yeeres for Grecia, when they reckon by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane

Archon, not Archidemides, whom Diodorus bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
And yet the ſame Pauſanias for the 29. Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piade
(whiche he maketh to be ſoone after Gyges

maketh Miltiaden to be Archon. But the print may

hauing that noble Paſſeouer, and Moſes copy hid from Manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,

               <p>Whereas H. Wolphius his friende, the next yeere after he

For an other Learned man: M. F. Iunius is deceyued as much.
Marke what he writeth vpon thoſe textes. Ezra, 4. 5. &amp; 24.
<hi>They hyred counſellers agaynſt them, to diſſlolue theyr
counſell all the dayes of Cyrus king of Paras, vnto the
reigne of Darius king of Paras.</hi> This Darius is (in the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

ten yeeres after Cyrus firſt yeere. Now for the verſe 34. of the
ſame Chapter marke Ezra. <hi>Then was hindered the worke,
and continued hindered vntyll the ſeconde yeere of the
reigne of Darius king of Paras.</hi> Though it hath been doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
with Iewes and Gentiles, that one and the ſame Darius is
meant in both places, yet he maketh the later, an other, Darius
Nothus, later by 98. yeeres. So theſe Chaldeans make vs breede
of one Kis two, of one Ezra two, of one Nehemias two, of one
Darius the firſt two, of one other Darius § three: &amp; for two yeres
in him to make 100.<note place="margin">D. Artaxerxes, D. Hyſtaſpis, and Darius Nothus.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The ſaw wherewith Manaſſes did cut Eſay the iuſt into
peeces, had not worſe teeth then theſe Chaldeans, who make vs
rent with our teeth the holy worde, from that playnneſſe which
is in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The Troianes which did pull downe their owne
Walles to receyue enimies to burne their Citie, are not ſimpler
then they who wylbe triumphing agaynſt a defender of their
owne nations Diuines, and wyll pull downe their owne Walles,
made not by Neptune and Apollo, as Homers Pergama, but by
Diuines of all learned languages. And this for Chaldeans, being
not a dead Horſe, but in Scripture language, dead Dogges.</p>
               <p>I could haue wyſhed that Learned men had not been brought
agaynſt mee: whom I turne more enimies to my aduerſary, then
I am, vpon his grauntes, and turne them to be vpon condemners
of his iudgement. I woulde haue been loth to caſt any blot of
their owne Incke vpon their Papers, yf I myght haue been vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouoked.
This any may ſee, that M. Fr. Iunius vpon <hi>Hoſea,</hi>

It was alwayes vſual to try trueth by diſputyng. And as

yeares more than <hi>Gabriels</hi> portion 130. of 490. vpon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
