            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Know no Subject that hath been more writ on, and worſe handled, than that of Trade; nor is it to be wondred at, ſince it is the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune of that Myſtery not to be in the hands of Philoſophers, or men bred to the Liberal Sciences; but ſuch whoſe Education hath been more in the <hi>Cantore,</hi> than Schools: And when men of finer Heads and Studies engage in it, they commonly make Flights as far above the genuine Meaning and Nature of Trade, as others that are better verſed in it do cover and deface it with Incoherence and Lumber.</p>
            <p>There is alſo another Diſadvantage that Treatiſes of Trade and Navigation lye under, which other Studies and Employments are not liable unto; and that is, Trade being <hi>Univerſal</hi> in its Nature, but <hi>Particular</hi> in the Practice, one Merchant dealing for one part of the World, and perhaps a ſtranger to another, yet if he writes of Trade, cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined unto his own Province, for that would be too narrow for a Diſcourſe of Trade; and if he ſhould keep within his Bounds, he may not be a proper Judge of that where he is a Party; and in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of his own Trade may interfere with that of his Neighbour, either by being ignorant of another's, or partial in his own concern: But it is not thus in
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:52493:3"/>
other Profeſſions; The Divine is within his limits, not intermixt with the Lawyer, nor is He with the Phyſician; yet each learned and qualified to expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate on their own Studies; and there being no part in any of the foregoing Arts practicable in matters of Trade, it ſeems to me a prejudice to Commerce, that ſo many trouble the world with their crude and undigeſted Notions in that which they underſtand not themſelves; nor can have any other effect, but diſturbing men that are in their own Track and beaten Road of Traffick; which is better for the Nation to have followed, than any particular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of private men: And therefore I conceive a Council of Trade abſolutely needful, where every man's Obſervation may be brought under a thorough Scrutiny, and out of all a Body of Trade com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Having ſaid this, I may be thought to condemn my ſelf in what I arraign in others; nor do I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to be quit of all I blame in others, my beſt defence being to claim the Privilege of being in the</hi> Crowd with the ſame Impunity others have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them; and perhaps have ſomething more to plead in my excuſe than moſt men have, my Education and Practice in Trade having been for Thirty Years at Home and Abroad in a Univerſal Trade. I know of but Four Trades that I have not ſome way been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in, the <hi>Eaſt-India, Turk, Muſcovy,</hi> and <hi>Green-land:</hi> And I muſt further ſay for my ſelf, That in all I here treat of, it is with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to better Judgments, not aſſerting my opinion in oppoſition to any other; tho I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:52493:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I cannot approve of many of thoſe Prints on Trade which I have ſeen, except what Sir <hi>Joſiah Child</hi> hath with great Judgment and more Perſpicuity ſet forth, than any I ever ſaw.</p>
            <p>What I deſign by the following Diſcourſe, is not much more than an Introduction to the other Parts that ſhall ſucceed; nor had this come forth alone, but that I have ſeen ſome things lately publiſh'd, that in my humble Opinion are no better than Libels on Trade; and tho I affect not Controverſies, and therefore do not name them, yet believe it may be uſeful to write another Senſe on the ſame Things; ſubmitting both to the Cenſure of better Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings.</p>
            <p>I think it a mortal Diſtemper in Trade (nor to be cured becauſe in the firſt Concoction), That we have ſo few men of Univerſity-Learning converſant in true Mercantine Employments: If there were as much care to have men of the beſt Heads and Education in it, as there is in the Laws, the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would fetch more from Abroad, and ſpend leſs in Law-Suits at Home. We have it reckoned up by the Infallible Author, as the Glory of a City, That her Merchants were Princes and Nobles; their Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and Tranſactions in the world with ſuch, is more than belongs to any other Set of men: Would it not then be the Honour of a Nation, as well as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, to have men of the beſt Senſe and Learning in the Foreign Negoce of a Kingdom? If ſuch had been in the Trade of theſe Kingdoms, it ſeems reaſonable to believe we had not lost the most conſiderable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigating Trade and Employment of our Seamen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:52493:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
It would be an aſtoniſhing Obſervation to men of any Countrey but our own, to ſee more Heads em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> to divide the Gain of the Nation, than there are Hands on the <hi>Exchange</hi> to gather it together. I have ſometimes thought, that if theſe Kingdoms lay not under the confuſion and unintelligibleneſs of Underſtanding in Trade, as the Builders of <hi>Babel</hi> did in Languages, we might without the Sin of thoſe arrogant Architects, erect ſuch Towers in Trade as might overtop the Univerſe in that Myſtery. We ſee how all Arts and Sciences have been improved in this Kingdom within the compaſs of one Century, but amongſt them all, the Merchants Part the leaſt; and the reaſon is plain, men of ſmall Learning and moderare Underſtanding, are generally put in it: For tho there are ſome of excellent Parts and clean Heads among them, yet the Major Part are not ſo poliſhed: I ſpeak not this to abate the Reſpect that I ſhall always think is due to the Profeſſion, and all men in it; but we know it is the Vanity of the Nation: Scarce a Tradeſman but if he have a Son that a Countrey Schoolmaſter tells him would make a Scholar, becauſe he learns his <hi>Grammar</hi> well, but immediately paſſes the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Kindred, who judge it pity ſo hopeful a Youth ſhould be loſt in Trade; the Univerſity is the only Soil fit for him to be planted in.</p>
            <p>By ſuch diſpoſition of the Youth of our Nation, many a good Tradeſman is loſt, and poor Scholars in every reſpect made; and if this Humour prevail in Mechanicks, and men of ordinary Quality; much more, and with better Pretenſions, it affects our Gentry; to be ſure the Eldeſt Son is above Trade,
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:52493:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and if the Younger be of a Quaint and Studious Temper, they are thought fit for the Law, not many for the Pulpit, which I confeſs I likewiſe think a Miſtake in our Gentry: Had we more of Them in the Clergy, we ſhould have fewer to deſpiſe, that might be better Builders of Houſes than of the Church.</p>
            <p>But to return to what I obſerve of the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all the Employments in the Kingdom, I ſee none that have arrived to that vaſt Increaſe as thoſe in the Law: This perhaps is accounted an evil; but I will not quarrel with that Long-Robe; I hope it will be no offence to wiſh them among us, but not with their Bar-Gowns; they would in my opinion look better in a Counting-houſe than in the <hi>Temple;</hi> and had the Humour of our Anceſtors run that way, as much as it did for the Law, there might have been as great an Enlargement in Maritime Traffick and Navigation, as there is now of the Laws: I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume none will ſay, that they began with equal Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; Trade had the Primogeniture, and ſet forth with the Employment of the People, before there could be work for Lawyers; and I believe thoſe of beſt value amongſt them do not think their Growth and Gain contributes to either in the Advantage of the Nation; tho without the Profeſſion there can be no ſecuring Property; but perhaps the Numbers make more work than there would be if they were leſs. <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> tho a Place of great Trade, allows but Two: And tho our Foreign Plantations are fill'd with men of no better Principles than they leave behind them, yet they have few among them who raiſe their Fortunes by the Law; for which no reaſon can
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:52493:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be given, but that there is not a Foundation and Nurſery for that Profeſſion to breed up Men of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Ingenuity in.</p>
            <p>I have been the longer on this Subject, becauſe there ſeems to me an Expedient in this matter; and that is, To make ſuch Proviſion for Noblemen and Gentlemens Children, as may be equally reputable with the Inns of Court, for young Gentlemen to come to from the Univerſities, and with leſs Charge than their Expence in Seven Years ſtudying the Law, become expert in Trade.</p>
            <p>To be thus managed: In each Maritime City and conſiderable Port of the Kingdom, to have a College built, in which there may be ſome Perſons of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in Trade, to teach and direct in the Myſtery of it, to all Parts of the World: And that they may have the Practick, as well as Theory, That every Perſon entring himſelf into the Society, may be obliged to bring in a Thouſand Pounds Stock, which will make a Capital perhaps of <hi>20</hi> or <hi>30000 l. Sterl.</hi> to Traffick with in Thirty Cities, &amp;c. in the Kingdom: They to be obliged to ſpend Five Years in this Society, and at the end of that Term to receive the Principal they brought, allowing the Caſualty of Profit and Loſs, as it happens: Going thus out, they will be entred in Trade, and probably have a Fund to begin with; and by this means Trade will fall into the hands of Gentlemen, Perſons of Learning and Conſideration in the Nation; and likewiſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve from misfortunes numbers that now miſcarry in their Studies of the Law, thorough Ill Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and having no Employments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:52493:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
To this <hi>Project</hi> (a Word now traduced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, tho in its ſelf of good ſignification both for Peace and War) I foreſee two Objections that will be made againſt it; and they are theſe:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> This will make too many Merchans.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this will leave no room for Younger Brothers, that have nothing to prefer them in the world, but a ſmall Sum to put them Pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to a Merchant, by which they often raiſe their Fortunes in the World.</p>
            <p>To the Firſt I anſwer, That the evil of having too many Merchants, is in the Numbers that are bred up from Apprentices; many of which coming into Buſineſs without Funds, ſtrain their Credit, which to keep above water they are forced to venture at all ways that have but a Probability of Succeſs, to keep themſelves in Buſineſs; and then to comply with their Credit often ſell to loſs, which in the end brings them to Misfortune, and that begets an Opinion that there are too many Traders; whereas the true reaſon is the Want of Stock, not Number of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Objection, That this will hinder Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants from taking Apprentices, is in part anſwered in the firſt, that their Number prejudice Trade: But there is a farther Conſideration in this matter, and that is, Two ſort of Youths ſtand Candidate for a Mercantine Education, Gentlemen with a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, others of leſs Quality with none. I think it will admit of no queſtion which ſhall be preferr'd; and that the other may be more profitably employ'd for the Nation and themſelves, in Trades that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more Labour and leſs Stock.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:52493:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But after all I have ſaid, my Wiſhes are greater than my Expectation, to ſee Trade thus courted in a Kingdom that treats it as ſome do their Wives, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering them no farther than to the Production of a Legitimate Poſterity, reſerving their Careſſes and Delights for a Miſs; ſo the Humour of this Age ſeems to incline, whilſt Foreign Commerce is neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and mens Thoughts and Deſigns run after Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Employments in the State; to pay which, Spider-like, the Nation ſpins out her Bowels to catch Flies; and the Simile goes farther, ſuch Food turns into Poiſon, where it feeds men faulty in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals; and ſuch too often ſupplant better men, or find ways to be preferr'd before them: To ſay this, will be no Offence to deſerving men; and for others, I ſhall only deſire them to ſnſpend their Reſentments until the Second Part comes forth, and then they will have more reaſon, becauſe it will come in my way to be more particular, when I come to ſpeak of the Trade of <hi>Ireland;</hi> in which there hath of late been ſuch Notorious Demonſtrations how Ill Men in Offices and Places of Truſt may ruin and deſtroy a Kingdom, as admits of no Defence. I have for this, the Authority of Both Houſes of Parliament in their Addreſſes to the King: And the Infallible Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor tells us, That <hi>he who ſaith to the wicked, Thou art righteous, the people will curſe, Nations ſhall abhor him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What I have ſaid in the following Diſcourſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to Trade and Navigation we have loſt, is not with prejudice to our Neighbours, who by their Induſtry and better Conduct have gained what we by ſupine Negligence and deſtructive Impoſitions on
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:52493:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Merchandiſe have loſt; nor do I think it Chriſtian or Human by Club-Law to take that from another Nation which God hath made common for every Nation to participate of, as they can entitle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the moſt early and beneficial Methods in Commerce. The <hi>Dutch</hi> lye moſt in our way in this Controverſy; but the Sea is wide enough for us both if we agree, but too narrow if we quarrel, for then we ſhall be apt to joſtle. How malicious it looks, I will not ſay, but to me it ſeems ſcandalous, to quarrel with men for their Induſtry; Envy is the Offſpring of Ignorance and Sloth, and is an evil quality in a people, tho it carries them not ſo far as to do others hurt, if it prevails with themſelves to do nothing; but as I am not for beating a Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler for being better mounted than my ſelf, and ſo making his Journey eaſier and ſooner than I can, yet I ſhould ſtop his Career if he broke through my Fence, or grazed on my Ground, or made it his Road. In ſome caſes it is ſo with Trade and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation; among others, that of <hi>New-found-land</hi> is the Property of the Imperial Crown of <hi>England;</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> have no more Right to fiſh there, than in the River of <hi>Thames:</hi> This Nation was the firſt that ever threw a Hook and Line in thoſe Seas; and tho there is no Land-marks above Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the Bank of <hi>New-found-land,</hi> (it lying out of ſight of the ſhore) yet there is under Water, from the firſt Soundings, and ſo far this Nation hath a Property; and we may now, if ever, hope to have it aſſerted, ſince we have a King who hath put a ſtop to that Towering Monarch who knew no Bounds before: And there ſeems good grounds to
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:52493:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
believe, That if we are not wanting to Him who expoſeth His Royal Perſon ſo far for us, That the <hi>French</hi> King muſt ſoon retire into his own Limits. But upon Diſcourſe of this nature I have been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, When it was ſo, and the War over, then, and not before, was a proper time to treat of Trade: I have mentioned ſomething of this in the following Sheets, and therefore ſhall ſay the leſs now; yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not omit that which ſtares us in the face, The Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of Trade in time of War drives many out of the Kingdom who will never return: It is obſerved ſo at this time of <hi>Ireland;</hi> Thouſands are come away ſince the Reduction of that unfortunate King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that endured the whole brunt of the War, and are not now in fear of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> but are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to Beggary by Idleneſs, for want of Trade and Employment that they formerly had; the conſequence of which is eaſy to be read, and how it will reach us at laſt; but we are a People that neither Fire, Sword, Plague, or Famine can work upon. He that ſilently laments, doats; and he that complains of our impendent Misfortunes, is mad; a Character now more in uſe than ever in this Nation, and found very uſeful for covering ſome mens actions: I ſpeak not this as having a Talent for, or deſire to be in Publick Employment; I never was in any: That which I believe would ſatisfy all men of Trade and Commerce, I am ſure it would me, is the Motion of a Parliament-Man of <hi>Leverpoole,</hi> which we find in Story; That a Bill being brought into the Houſe which bore hard on the Commons, in Trials for Life and Death of the Lords, the honeſt man of <hi>Leverpoole</hi> ſtood up and ſaid, <hi>Since he ſaw</hi>
               <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:52493:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>the Houſe were for paſſing that Bill, he gave his Aſſent alſo; provided there might be this Exception in the Act, That no Lord ſhould kill either him, his Wife</hi> Joan, <hi>Son</hi> Tom, <hi>or any of the good Town of</hi> Leverpoole <hi>for which he ſerved.</hi> So ſay I, Since the Nation are content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Publick Treaſure ſhould be ſhared among Offices and Employments, Merchants and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, &amp;c. are content, ſo that they in the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will give Security and Encouragement for Trade, which pays them all; but they are not wiſe to themſelves that let Trade run from them, whilſt they are warring to ſecure it; our Neighbours do not ſo.</p>
            <p>Our improvidence in this matter is to our great Reproach, ſince we are under the Bleſſing of ſuch a Government as this Nation never had but once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: And it is not to be forgotten, that in that Reign, tho encompaſſed with Wars, there was more done in the advancement ef Trade and Navigation than ever was done before: We have taken care to loſe much of it ſince; but we have now a King that denies us nothing we ask for the good of the Nation; and where any thing is entire in himſelf (and it is well ſome things are ſo) we find it, There never was Better or Greater Men in the Church and on the Bench; which is ſufficient demonſtration, that where we are unhappy, it is by our own Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and Parties. The Filth of the laſt Reign ſtill ſticks about us; from which Time will, I hope, relieve the King and Us.</p>

ON Trade in General.</head>
               <p>THESE Kingdoms of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> differ from moſt parts of the World, in that of their Strength, as they do in that of their Scituation, and Aptneſs for Trade.</p>
               <p>Their Scituation gives them the Preferrance of the moſt Valuable Trade in the World, which muſt paſs their Doors before it comes to their Neighbours; and as they are happy in their Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, ſo are they as Superiour to other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys in their Native Growth and Production for Commerce; as Rich Soyl is to that which is Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren; theſe Kingdoms producing Trade as ſome Land doth Fruit, without Art or Labour, when other Countries like forced Ground raiſe their Trade by Aſſiduity in both: And ſuch a People are more to be feared, than thoſe that abound with the Bleſſings of Nature, but want that of Induſtry; we need go no further than the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> for Demonſtrarion.</p>
               <p>The Danger that hath been impendent over us for more than Thirty Years in this of our Trade, is from the <hi>French;</hi> and in Truth no Nation in the World can ſo well conteſt it with <hi>England</hi> as they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52493:10"/>
can; and therefore it ſeems reaſonable to conſider them in this as much as we do in that of their Armes; and perhaps they may be found laying a Foundation in War to enlarge their Trade and Navigation, and we at the ſame time declining in both.</p>
               <p>That theſe Kingdoms cannot be ſafe under the Growth of <hi>France</hi> none will deny, and that it is ſafer for <hi>England</hi> to meet them in <hi>Flanders</hi> than here; but if the Advance Guards ſhould be only conſider'd, and the Main Body neglected, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence might be fear'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our Naval Force is thought the Main Body and Strength of the Nation: </hi>Now though large Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies in Parliament are abſolutely neceſſary for that uſe, yet there is ſomething elſe wanting to make us formidable at Sea, and that is<hi> Marine </hi>Trade and Navigation, which like Food to the Body muſt be dayly renewed, or elſe our Naval Strength will decay.<hi> And although perhaps it is not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, yet the want of Seamen for our Navigation and Trade in time of Naval War, Impoveriſheth the Nation more than the Charge of the War.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There goes many Threads to make up the Webb of Trade, too fine for every eye to ſee; and among others the Cheap Navigating Ships is one: Now our want of Seamen obligeth Merchants to advance their Wages, and that gives Advantage to our Neighbours in carrying Commodities chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to a Market than we can, and conſequently makes them the Carriers of our Produce and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactory; which is the only certain Gain in Trade. Merchants often looſe when a Ship Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives ſafe in Port, but Seamen have their full Wages.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52493:10"/>
There is alſo another Prejudice and Loſs to the Nation, and that is carrying Money out by Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Seamen that are imployed in our Merchant-Men, ¼<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being allowed by the Act of Navigation; which might have been thought the only miſtake in that Act, if the Conſideration of our not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſufficient for our Ships had not produced that Liberty.</p>
               <p>As Naval War abates the number of our Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſo it increaſeth thoſe of the <hi>French;</hi> for that they imploy more Seamen in their Privateers, than they do in time of Peace in Merchant-Men: And as this affects us in War, ſo it may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be fear'd it will in time of Peace; <hi>For having ſo many Seamen made to their hands, will naturally put them upon inlarging their Navigation; to which they will be the more incouraged by our want of Men to ſupply ours, which they will ſoon fall into.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Abating of our <hi>Marine</hi> Imployments hath a worſe Conſequence than the Loſs of our Trade; for that it ſeems the moſt effectual way to lay us open to the Invaſion of the <hi>French,</hi> which <hi>we are no longer ſecure from, than whilſt we Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Sea;</hi> And if we find the <hi>French</hi> alone able to contend with us and the <hi>Dutch</hi> United, what might they not do if they ſhould be aſſiſted with other helps, and we left ſingle to oppoſe them, <hi>There are more ways than one to bring ſuch a Revolution in</hi> Europe: And therefore it ſeems of the greateſt moment for this Nation, to provide in their Naval Force, as if they were left to their own defence againſt the Power of more than the <hi>French</hi> at Sea: It is, no doubt, the Intereſt of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52493:11"/>
to ſupport the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and it is hoped we ſhall never be divided. But that Kingdom is in an ill Condition that cannot ſecure its ſelf without the Force of its Allies</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Such Reflections as theſe may not be improper in this Age,</hi> They were thought neceſſary in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when ſhe queſtion'd the <hi>French</hi> of Building a Ship of War but of Fourteen Guns.</p>
               <p>And ſince they are now above ſuch Demands, and that we cannot reſtrain them, it ſeems neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for us to increaſe our own; and that is not poſſible to be done any other way than by Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our Navigation, and inlarging our Trade, <hi>without which we may fight for the Sovereignty of the Sea until we have loſt the uſe of it.</hi> If Account were taken of thoſe ſeveral Trades that this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath in a manner totally loſt ſince the Reign of <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, it might open thoſe Eyes that are alwayes ſhut to that which is the Strength and Riches of this Nation, as Navigation is.</p>
               <p>There were many Thouſand Seamen formerly imployed, where for late years we have few or none, as the <hi>Greenland,</hi> and <hi>Muſcovy</hi> Trade loſt; that of the <hi>North-Seas,</hi> and <hi>Newfound-Land,</hi> little better; moſt of our <hi>Eaſtland-Trades</hi> mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Foreign Ships; and ſo the Trade of <hi>Ireland;</hi> the neglect of which in that point, as well as ſome others, may be found when it is too late of pernicious Conſequence to <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are Trades we loſt to the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Northern</hi> Navigation, in time of Peace; and this War hath brought on the Stage the <hi>Portugeſe,</hi> a Nation we leaſt fear'd; yet under this cover, we may very well looſe great part of our <hi>Southern</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:52493:11"/>
                  <hi>Trade.</hi> We formerly imployed our Ships in their <hi>Braziel</hi> and other Trades, and now we are forced to imploy theirs; not only becauſe of their being Free Ships, <hi>but alſo becauſe we cannot get Seamen to Navigate our own Ships.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By Accidents of War, Trade often ſhifts from one Nation to another, and ſome will ſtick behind after the War is ended; for that Seamen and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants reſt where they find moſt Incouragement; and wherever they come they are made wellcom, and when the benefit they bring to the Countrey they Trade in is obſerved, they will not want Incouragement to ſtay there: There never was a fairer opportunity, if the <hi>Portugueze</hi> make uſe of the Introduction this War hath given them; to make <hi>Lisbon</hi> the Mart for Trade, and Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <hi>Weſtern</hi> and <hi>Levant</hi> Trade: It is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake to think that Navigation and <hi>Marine</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments can have no growth where the Natives are not Numerous and Apt for the Sea.</p>
               <p>Trade is beſt Improved by good Laws, and Incouragement for Strangers; where ſuch are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a Scituation for Trade, that place will be crowded; and ſo would <hi>Lisbon</hi> and the <hi>Portugueze Ports</hi> if it were not for the <hi>Inquiſition;</hi> but it is believed the Rigour of that will be Aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted now they have taſted the ſweets of Trade. All theſe things make againſt us, and though little conſider'd, bodes ill for theſe Kingdoms; if ſome extraordinary, and ſpeedy Reſolutions be not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to regain our <hi>Navigation</hi> and <hi>Sea-Imployments,</hi> this Nation will fall under ſome Foreign Power. It is eaſie to read our Deſtiny, nor will it be like a Conqueſt on a Continent; <hi>One Day at Sea may</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:52493:12"/>
                  <hi>determine the Fate of theſe Kingdoms;</hi> and if we have no <hi>Fund</hi> or <hi>Nurſery</hi> for Seamen in Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>French,</hi> and others about us, what can be expected.</p>
               <p>That which I humbly conceive the moſt viſible Means to preſerve theſe Kingdoms in their Trade and Navigation, and nothing but that can provide for their Naval Force, <hi>is the ſetting up a National Bank:</hi> This now on foot is too little, and yet too bigg; the firſt becauſe it promotes nothing of our Navigation, but on the contrary may be fear'd to Deſtroy it, by that Tax on Shipping; but I have left my <hi>Bank;</hi> which as I conceive too little for the reaſon I mention'd, ſo I think it too big becauſe it will Ingroſs the Money, and conſequently the Trade of the <hi>Nation,</hi> into one City; and will draw from all Parts of the Kingdom thoſe little Sums that do now in great meaſure ſupport the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factoryes of the <hi>Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When there was no place where Money could be lodg'd at Intereſt for a Day; it was eaſie for Induſtrious Men to borrow from their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; and by that means our Manufactories were made Plenty and Cheap; but now a little time will ſhew they can be neither: But of this I have writ my thoughts a part.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bank</hi> that I conceive would be uſeful in this Nation, muſt be of ſuch Univerſal Extent, that every Perſon in the Kingdom may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in it, and that every corner in the Kingdom ſhall partake of the Streams that run from it: That out of this <hi>Bank</hi> there may be Proviſion for Ships and Seamen.</p>
               <p>That thoſe Trades before-mentioned, that we
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52493:12"/>
have loſt may be retrieved; and ſuch Methods laid down as may incourage that Navigation which imploys moſt Seamen, as the Fiſhing, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To Eſtabliſh this <hi>Bank</hi> will require great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, for that as it may be Conſtituted, the Trade and Treaſure of this Nation will be very much increas'd; all the Poor and now Uſeleſs hands Imployed, not a Beggar in the Streets: And ſince <hi>England</hi> wants nothing ſo much as Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>One way to ſupply that defect, is to increaſe your work for them you have:</hi> And ſo one Man may be better than two, as to the Riches of the Nation.</p>
               <p>And the full Imployments of the Hands we have is the only way to get more; but to invite Strangers into a Kingdom, where <hi>the Taxes for the Poor amount to more than the Revenue of ſome of the Neighbouring Countreys,</hi> ſhews we conſider Trade as wiſe Men do Play, for Diverſion, not Buſineſs; and in that Deluſion may be read the Ruine of theſe Nations.</p>

                  <hi>Of Naturalizing and Incouraging </hi>Foreign Proteſtants.</head>
               <p>IT is obſerved that though there is no part in the Univerſe ſo ſtreightned, and filled with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants as the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> yet there is no Government that gives ſuch Incouragement to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite in more: They make their Country as God hath the Air, every Mans Property that Breathes in it; and equally in the Power of a Man to be a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52493:13"/>
                  <hi>Deniſon,</hi> or a <hi>Tenant,</hi> a Burger as a Pariſhioner; the good Effect it hath in that Commonwealth needs no Illuſtration.</p>
               <p>It may be ſuppoſed this Provident Oeconomy happen'd in that State, above any Government in <hi>Europe,</hi> by reaſon of their being of latter Date in their Eſtabliſhment, and ſo ſaw the miſtakes of their Neighbours; and on the other hand our Government deriving from Antiquated Laws, and Preſcriptions, which according to the Experience of thoſe times made Bullwarks againſt Strangers and Foreigners; believing they could never be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure of what they had in poſſeſſion, or at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to inlarge their Fortunes, if Strangers were allow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d the Freedom of Natives: <hi>But in the Reign of</hi> Hen 3. <hi>there was large Immunities given to the</hi> Eaſterlins, then ſo called, to ſettle Trade in the Kingdom, which the <hi>Steel-Yard</hi> yet bears the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of, but that was but a particular and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thing; the Old Laws and Prohibition of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalization ſtill continued, and by it this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom deprived of ſuch Numbers as might have in ſome proportion fill'd thoſe waſtes that this fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Iſland hath now in it, for that it cannot be ſaid to be one half Peopled</p>
               <p>There now ſeems a greater tendency in the Nation to remove thoſe Bars that lie in the way of New-Comers by that Charitable Law for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience, and as we owe great part of our <hi>Woollen Manufactories</hi> to the Bleſſed Memory of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> receiving in the Perſecuted Proteſtants from Flanders, whoſe Poſterity are now become Natives, ſo may we the Inlarging of our Navigation, Fiſhing, and Numbers of our Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52493:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to this Reign, if Incouragement were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Invite Proteſtants of all Nations to ſettle here with the ſame Security and Priviledge as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will not determine whither the Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Offices and Imployments of Profit, may not be neceſſary to ſuch as are not born in that Kingdom, but I think that would be no obſtacle to ſuch as are worth receiving for that Trade, and purchaſing in that Kingdom muſt be the buſineſs of thoſe as are ſuppoſed to be invited in, and there Poſterity will be capable of Preferments in the Common-wealth, and the fewer there is of ſuch, (I mean Places and Offices of Profit amongſt us,) the better; we ſee it ſo in the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> where perchance there is not by Civil Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments ſo many Men Inriched as we have in one Pariſh. Where there is moſt Trade there is feweſt Offices.</p>
               <p>But to return to the Advantage of bringing in Foreigners, I preſume Men of Real Eſtates do believe that it will advance the Rates of Lands by a greater Conſumption of the Native Product.</p>
               <p>And however ſome of our <hi>Artizans</hi> may miſtake it, yet the moſt conſiderable of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that the Increaſe of Hands in labour improves and increaſes Manufactory, even in the very Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of them that are added; one Man that Works may have five or ſix that only Eats and Wears.</p>
               <p>And it is undeniable that if the Increaſe of hands abates the Price of Manufactoryes, it will inlarge their Exports and Expence at home; the Cheap making of Manufactories abroad is known to be the chief Cauſe of abating our Rent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:52493:14"/>
The next Conſideration is that of <hi>Seamen,</hi> to Increaſe them by Foreigners admits of no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection ſince we are forced to make uſe of them at dear Rates, and they carry out our Money for their Wages. If Merchants will not complain at the bringing in and Naturalizing Foreign Seamen, for the Reaſons before; ſo neither will our Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men complain, for that the Increaſe of them will eaſe ours from the Preſs, when Foreigners are made as liable to it as they; whereas now they do our Seamen a double Injury, take their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in Merchant-men, and leave them no way of getting their Bread, but by Sailing in Men of War. There remains then only to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd the Prejudice Foreign Merchants may do to ours; for none deny but that they are an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to all other Societies and Perſons in the Nation by their Trade and Expence; but to our Merchants, ſome may ſay they are a hindrance; though I do not think any Merchant, that is truly ſo, will ſay it, they are not found ſo in <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> but Merchants there are pleaſed with their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and it is alwayes accounted a Misfortune, even by them that ſlay, to have Merchants quitt a Place.</p>
               <p>There might be much more ſaid, if it were wanting, to ſhew, That Naturaliſing Foreign Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants can be no Prejudice to Natives; but ſince it concerns Men of the beſt Sence and Knowledge in buſineſs, it is but waſte of Time: They know Foreign Merchants abate not their Trade for want of Naturalization, but it is our advantage to have them brought under the Taxes and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Charge in the Nation, as well as to have their Eſtates fixed in it.</p>
               <p>

Upon the whole I ſubmit to better Judgment, Whither the Treaſure of the Nation in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Men, which I take to be of the greateſt Value.</p>
               <p>The Wealth of the Nation by their Eſtates and their Support of the Government by bearing part of the charge of it, will not be advanced by the bringing Foreign Proteſtants into all the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and Immunity of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, which it in time will make ſo. If we reflect on the Numbers loſt in five years paſt, there may ſeem as much reaſon to recruit the Nation as the Army<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Laws and Property hath always been the Language of our Nation, and much talk of ſecuring them; this ought to be done, but there is ſomething of greater Value that ought not to be left undone, which we hear not off; and that is, Proviſion for the Increaſe of Poſterity, and Wayes to Invite in preſent Supplies. If this came once under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Parliament, I cannot but believe it would produce the beſt Statute this Nation ever ſaw.</p>

That then which I conceive would be the beſt management this Nation ever made of <hi>Ireland,</hi> would be to diſpoſe the Forfeitures of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to Strangers of all ſorts that are not of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and having made that exception, it will be neceſſary to give my Reaſons for it. My Principles (I muſt confeſs) are againſt Force in Religion; but in this Caſe of <hi>Ireland</hi> there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to exclude as much as may be, thoſe that have any Relation or dependance on the Church; becauſe the <hi>Iriſh</hi> are a Bigotted People, and own a Foreign Juriſdiction, which is a Principle againſt the Government and Laws of the Land; and where thoſe of that Opinion are ſuperiour in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to them that are in the Intereſt of Government, it ſeems abſolutely Incumbent on the Government to provide againſt ſuch Men as believe themſelves under the moſt Sacred Tyes of Religion and Conſcience, to Obey and Promote the Edicts and Injunctions of a Foreign Prince, for ſo the Pope is. But to return to that of bringing Proteſtants to <hi>Ireland;</hi> I conceive there muſt be more than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them Denizons, becauſe at this time <hi>Ireland</hi> differs very little from a new Plantation, and to Plant ſuch, there is always given larger Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to New Comers, than in Setled and Planted Countreys. If therefore ſuch Methods were thought on, as might make thoſe that would ſettle in that Kingdom Freeholders of ſmall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of Lands at very eaſie Rents, that might be a great Inducement to Foreigners to go and fill that Countrey, and they would ſoon by intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Marriages with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Britiſh;</hi> and ſo thoſe of the Intereſt of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

               <p>But ſuch a diſpoſition as this would prevent Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Rebellions, and alſo greatly Improve the Trade and Navigation of this Kingdom; For it is to be Noted, that the Chief Conſumption of <hi>Ireland</hi> is of the Product and Manufactory of this Kingdom: And by an Account I have ſeen, <hi>Ireland</hi> takes off more from us than <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>New England;</hi> and if we take it into our Care, would Imploy more of our Ships; but of that I intend in the ſecond part of my Eſſayes to treat at large, and in the mean time ſhall here Inſert <hi>Verbatim</hi> part of a Diſcourſe I find in a Pamphlet, Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>The Linnen and Woollen Manufactories:</hi> A Diſcourſe Printed in the Year 1691: The whole was Rational; but that which I think applicable to what I am now upon, was as followeth: He begins the Paragraff thus, as I ſaid before, <hi>Ireland is no more than one of our Foreign Plantations, only I think it will be allowed the firſt Place, and more than any other in nearneſs of Blood; and that of our Nobles there being many Families in that Kingdom deſcended from the Antient Families of this; and moſt of the Eſtates in</hi> Ireland <hi>held by the decent from our Brethren, who purchas'd it with their Blood:</hi> Theſe Reflections may prevail for our care of them, at leaſt to any Collony abroad; and we never think it our prejudice to have them thrive, nor would the growth of <hi>Ireland,</hi> if rightly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

or underſtood: And here give me leave to make a Digreſſion, if it may be call'd ſo, but you may think it not Foreign to the Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>I find it generally believed that <hi>Ireland</hi> is as miſchievous to our Trade in time of Peace, as it is deſtructive to our Men and Treaſure in time of War; and though this Opinion never went far with me, yet ſomething I did doubt was in it, until I met with ſomething that gave plain Demonſtration to the contrary, and it was this:</p>
               <p>I fell into an intire acquaintance with a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Ireland,</hi> whoſe experience and long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in all the Foreign Trade of that Kingdom furniſhed him with Arguments I could not anſwer, to prove that <hi>England</hi> was a great Gainer by the Trade of <hi>Ireland.</hi> When I could not confute him, nor he prevail with me; he told me he would ſhew me that which carried Authority with it; and ſo he did, being as he aſſur'd me, the work of ſome years, as he could ſpare time to compoſe it: The whole Diſcourſe takes up many Sheets upon the Trade of <hi>Ireland</hi> to all parts, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Remarks upon every Commodity Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and Imported into that Kingdom; and where, and how it affects <hi>England.</hi> Some other things he reſerv'd as Secrets from me, as he doth the reſt from others; for it was never ſeen by any but one beſide my ſelf. Out of the whole, he hath extracted an Account of the Exports and Imports for one year in a medium out of ſix; and then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd what related to <hi>England,</hi> by what Ships brought in and out; then computed the Value of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52493:17"/>
each Commodity, and to what they were Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, being Manufactor'd in <hi>England,</hi> and then what Money in Specie, or Bills of Exchange, which is the ſame, was returned from Foreign Parts to <hi>England,</hi> out of the Proceed of Goods ſent from <hi>Ireland;</hi> all which appear'd, (being brought up to a Sum) that <hi>England</hi> Gained by <hi>Ireland</hi> Two Millions Sterling <hi>per Annum:</hi> It ſeem'd to me an Incredible thing; but being (as he affirms) Matter of Fact, for which he hath the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Cuſtoms, it is not to be denyed; the breviate is drawn in ſo plain and intelligible a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, as renders it eaſie to any Underſtanding, and therefore to mine: I would fain have prevailed with him to Print the whole Matter, but he thinks it may be made uſe of a better way; and affirms that as great as this looks, yet it might be improved to much more, if the Trade of <hi>Ireland</hi> were diſpos'd as it might be to the Advantage of <hi>England:</hi> But he ſaid that Kingdom was in no Reign ſince the firſt Conqueſt of <hi>Ireland</hi> conſulted in its Trade, but left to its ſelf, or treated like an Enemy: All the uſe made of it was for Courtiers Men of Projection and Neceſſity to Traffick, and diſpoſe it into Grants, Imployments, and Offices and ſo made it rather a Foreſt for Game, than a Plantation for Trade and Commerce; and that which continued it ſo in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, was the Jealouſies and Miſtakes of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> believing it grew too faſt, and incroached on their Trade, though it is demonſtrable <hi>Ireland</hi> doth us no hurt, but where we by our own Laws force it; and that Act (pardon the expreſſion) like Lunaticks, that ſtrive to ſuppreſs their Shadows for fear they ſhould aſſault them.</p>

None will ſay, <hi>England</hi> would be the worſe if it were double the Acres it now is; And though the Sea part us from <hi>Ireland,</hi> may not Laws make us one in our Intereſt and Trade; and ſo that <hi>Ireland</hi> may be more profitable to <hi>England</hi> in General, than <hi>Wales,</hi> or any County in <hi>England</hi> is to the whole in its proportion. There never was ſo fair an opportunity for Inriching this Nation by <hi>Ireland,</hi> as now it is by Divine Providence once put a Blank in our hands, in which His Majeſty may ſtamp what he pleaſes: And we have reaſon to believe, That He who ventures His Royal Perſon ſo freely for the Preſervation of theſe Kingdoms, will not deny us any thing that can contribute to our Growth in Trade and Treaſure. One thing I muſt not omit, which I had from this Gentleman of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that to me ſeems valid for Confirmation of all he aſſerts, That <hi>Ireland</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Interferes with, nor gains on <hi>England;</hi> for that in the laſt Twenty Years of <hi>Irelands</hi> greateſt Proſperity, not one Man in <hi>England</hi> purchaſed in <hi>Ireland;</hi> but Numbers of <hi>Ireland</hi> have in that time purchaſed in <hi>England,</hi> as they of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, I mean the <hi>Engliſh</hi> always do, as they In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their Fortunes. This being ſo, <hi>Ireland</hi> is to <hi>England</hi> a Mine of Treaſure, and affects us, though in a much larger Proportion; as <hi>New-found-Land, Hudſon</hi>'s-<hi>Bay,</hi> whatever is gained in them, terminates in <hi>England.</hi> Here I end with the Pamphlet, of which I ſhall only ſay, If the Matter of Fact be truly Related, as by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority he gives, we have reaſon to believe it is, then there is plain Demonſtration that <hi>Ireland</hi> hath been, and may be made much more profitable to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52493:18"/>
this Kingdom, then moſt of our Foreign Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Of them we take great care; and why not more of this, ſince it lies ſo near, and coſts us ſo dear, ſeems unaccountable: The truth is, our Anceſtours had never ſuch a happy Juncture to do it, as we have now to ſecure it: If therefore we lay not hold on the opportunity put into our hands, we cannot anſwer it ſo well as they might.</p>
               <p>The Numbers of Refugees here, and in other Countreys near us, are Objects in this caſe, both for our Charity to them, and Advantage to our ſelves.</p>
               <p>There hath been for ſeveral Seſſions of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment much talk of the Forfeitures of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that it was reaſonable they ſhould be Sold, and made a Fund to raiſe Money towards the carrying on the preſent War; which might be thought rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable for us of <hi>England</hi> to preſs, becauſe it would eaſe us of ſo much in our Taxes: But why the Gentlemen of <hi>Ireland</hi> were ſo buſie to promote it, was at firſt to me a queſtion, and ſet me on the Inquiry; and from ſome of themſelves I had this anſwer, That though they could not deny but the benefit of thoſe Forfeitures were juſtly due to us of <hi>England,</hi> yet the Juſtice of the thing was not all the motive they had to promote it; but their own future ſecurity was at leaſt as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd by them, for that they hoped the Sale of thoſe Forfeited Lands would put them in Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant hands, and by that, ſtrengthen the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which could never be ſecure, whilſt the <hi>Iriſh</hi> held ſo great a proportion in the Kingdom; and that whilſt the Land lay undiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they fear'd the <hi>Iriſh</hi> would find wayes to be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52493:18"/>
reſtor'd, they having got enough by their Robberies and Plunder of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to purchaſe them, though they coſt them Ten Years purchaſe: And that they were in fear alſo of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> buying from ſuch as had great Grants of Forfeited Lands; but if there was a Publick Sale, they would come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo many hands, that moſt of them would ſtick with the Purchaſer, and not come to the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> They further ſaid, It was not the Intereſt of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to let the Forfeitures come again into the <hi>Iriſh</hi> hands; for that they never Improved, nor Traded, and ſo were no wayes profitable to <hi>England.</hi> If this apprehenſion of the Proteſtants be valid, either to them, or us, it ſeems that a diſpoſition of theſe Forfeitures of <hi>Ireland</hi> to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Strangers would anſwer all objections, and be a more certain way to keep ſuch Lands of <hi>Ireland</hi> out of <hi>Iriſh</hi> hands, then by ſelling them to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> for by that they would be to greater value in one Mans hand, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would for advantage ſell them to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Proprietors; for that few Purchaſers would go to ſettle on their Lands, nor could they find Tenants in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, ſince there is ſo much Land waſte; but if Foreigners had it in ſmall Proportions, they would be able to manage it themſelves, and ſo keep it from returning to the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> I have been longer on this of the Forfeitures, then perhaps will be thought proper, ſince my Subject is Trade: But ſince it hath relation to the Improvement of <hi>Ireland</hi> in the way of Trade, this Digreſſion I hope will be excus'd.</p>
               <p>I return then to ſhew, how the bringing in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fugees to <hi>Ireland</hi> will advance the Trade of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and that may appear in three particulars.</p>

that draws compaſſion more from one Man to another, than ſeeing Men of honeſt and unblameable Converſation us'd worſe than Thieves and Robbers for ſerving God according to their Conſcience.

               <p>Such Numbers of Men being gone out of the Kingdom for want of that Liberty they may now injoy, it is a wonder they do not return; and a greater, that they are not ſent for, and Invited back: We do not conſider what the loſs of a Man is in a Kingdom not half Peopled: We want nothing ſo much as Bodies of Men; and it is ſaid, we have above Thirty Thouſand in Foreign Countreys, and they are not of the raff, but ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Induſtrious People; ſuch as theſe ſhould not be loſt.</p>

I would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him to offer it to the Houſe, but he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects a great Gratification, and that he thinks at this time will not be given; though I am of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mind, and believe he deſerves more than he can either ask or expect, if his Project takes. It is indeed to be lamented, that ſolid Propoſals for the Trade and Manufactory of the Nation ſhould not meet with ſo much Incouragement as a Lottery; but to the contrary ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: And I know a great Miniſter, who once diſputed on that with warmth againſt a care for <hi>Wooll,</hi> and that it was a burthen to the Nation; It may not be Foreign to this Diſcourſe to give the heads of the Diſpute, which I the rather do, that ſo it may ſhew the need there is for the Great Council of the Nation to take it under their Conſideration.</p>

                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:52493:21"/>
The Diſcourſe roſe on a Propoſition that was brought to him, for ſtopping a vaſt Quantity of <hi>Wooll</hi> that was then going to <hi>France;</hi> it was brought him in Writing, and demonſtrated, That that very <hi>Wooll</hi> was enough to work up all the Coarſe <hi>Wooll</hi> of <hi>France</hi> for Seven Years; and that the conſequence would be the loſs of great part of our Manufactories to <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Miniſter made little return to that, but brought his Diſcourſe to the great Loſs it was to Men of Eſtates; that there was not a way for Selling twice the <hi>Wooll</hi> that now they did; That there was three Years <hi>Wooll</hi> then in <hi>England,</hi> and what ſhould Men do upon this Topick of the want of a Conſumption for the <hi>Wooll</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the Gentleman laid down theſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the extraordinary Eſcapes of <hi>Wooll</hi> to Foreign Parts, put them upon making more <hi>Woollen Manufactories</hi> than ever they did before, and that abated our Trade abroad.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That our <hi>Wooll</hi> going to Foreign Parts made it ſo cheap at home; This I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member put the Miniſter into a <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aughter; and laying the two firſt aſide, he deſir'd him to make out the laſt Poſition, That the Eſcapes of <hi>Wooll</hi> to Foreign Parts made the <hi>Wooll</hi> fall in Price: That the ſending ſo great Quantities of <hi>Wooll</hi> out of the Kingdom ſhould fall the Price of that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52493:22"/>
which was left, was a Miſtery he could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, but ſeem'd to him, the only way to make it riſe: But the Gentleman undertook to make out his Aſſertion, that every Pound of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Wooll</hi> worked up Three Pound of Foreign <hi>Wooll;</hi> and that as much as they Manufactur'd, ſo much was Abated in our Exports; for that they made ſuch Manufactoryes with our <hi>Wooll,</hi> as they could not make without it; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by that means, one pound of our <hi>Wooll</hi> with theirs, made four times as much Cloaths and Stuffs as we could have made with it, if we had kept it at home: From which he Inferred, That if one fourth of the <hi>Wooll</hi> of <hi>England</hi> went to Foreign Parts, there would be as much Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factoryes made Abroad for Foreign Markets, as we could make, if we had wrought all our own <hi>Wooll;</hi> and ſo much being made Abroad, we could not have uſe for half our own <hi>Wooll</hi> that was left: This he affirmed was the reaſon that there lay ſo much <hi>Wooll</hi> unwrought in <hi>England;</hi> and he being brought for Proof of what he ſaid, That which was Matter of Fact I thought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable, though it would not be allowed ſo by the Miniſter: The thing was this, The Year after the Reſtauration, there was a Gentleman that got a Grant from the King, with a <hi>Non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante</hi> to any Statute, for Liberty to Export a certain Quantity of <hi>Wooll</hi> to Foreign Parts from <hi>Ireland;</hi> upon which, ſome Merchants in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> buying the Grant, ſent over to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and bought moſt of the <hi>Wooll,</hi> and ſent it to Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Parts; this at firſt rais'd the Price of <hi>Wooll</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:52493:22"/>
both there and in <hi>England;</hi> but in ſo ſhort a time as Five Moneths, it fell Fifty <hi>per Cent.</hi> And though not one fourth of what formerly came from <hi>Ireland</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> came then to <hi>England,</hi> yet there was no Vent for the <hi>Wooll</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> and in <hi>Ireland</hi> it fell from Seven Shillings to Three Shillings and Six Pence, their Stone of Sixteen pounds all the time they ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped it for Foreign Parts. This he affirm'd he could prove by the Merchants Books that were concern d, to be litterally true; and that the Year after the Shipping for Foreign Parts was over, that <hi>Wooll</hi> riſe to its former Price both here and in <hi>Ireland.</hi> And he farther added, that the great Quantities which by ſtealth go from <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> makes <hi>Wooll</hi> in both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms fall in Price, according to the Quantities that are ſent out. This part of the Diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over, the next Queſtion was, Whither the <hi>Wooll</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> did not Abate the Price of the <hi>Wooll</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and hinder Sheep Maſters from Inlarging their Flocks, and conſequently keep down the Rents of Land. This was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in the Negative to all the three, that it did not Abate the Price of <hi>Engliſh Wooll,</hi> nor hinder the Increaſe of Sheep, or Abate the Rents of Land: That the <hi>Iriſh Wooll</hi> coming into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> helped the working up of ſome <hi>Wooll</hi> that could not be made the moſt of without it. That the <hi>Wooll</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> was a larger Staple than that of <hi>England,</hi> and moſt proper for <hi>Bayes</hi> and <hi>Serges:</hi> That it was not the <hi>Wooll</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> that came to <hi>England</hi> that made the Price fall, but it
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52493:23"/>
was that which went to Foreign Parts that did the Miſchief; and for the reaſons before given, he concluded, that if there went no <hi>Wooll</hi> from <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi> to Foreign Parts, all the <hi>Wooll</hi> of both Kingdoms would not be half enough to ſupply the Manufactories that <hi>England</hi> would have Markets for Abroad; for that there is now made twice as much Manufactories with the help of our <hi>Wooll</hi> Abroad, as is made in <hi>England;</hi> ſo that if there were an effectual ſtop upon the <hi>Wooll</hi> of both Kingdoms, the Flocks of both might be trebled, and yet not be ſufficient for the Manufactories <hi>England</hi> might vent. This in few words was the beſt account I ever heard of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Improvement of the <hi>Wooll</hi> of theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and is ſuch demonſtration of the Miſchief the Exports of <hi>Wooll</hi> doth to the Nation, that I cannot but think him a worſe Enemy to his Country than a Common Pyrate; for that he robs but a ſmall Number, but he that ſends out <hi>Wooll,</hi> deſtroys Thouſands, weakens the Strength of the Nation both at Land and Sea; and if we believe the Lord <hi>Coke</hi>'s Aſſertion, That Nine parts of the Trade of <hi>England</hi> comes from the Sheeps Back, there cannot be enough done to ſecure it; but it hath ever been the misfortune of our Nation, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to puniſh or reward Impunity in the firſt, makes us abound in Criminals; and the neglect in the latter makes us barren of great Actions for our Countrey; I mean, in that which makes a Nation Rich and Wiſe: Our Anceſtours ſhewed more of their good will to it in the Dark of Trade and Navigation, than we do at Noon-day. I

have often thought that it was poſſible for a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of theſe Kingdoms to make all <hi>Europe</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butaries to him in Trade, by a true Management of the Natureal and Artificial Product and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation of theſe Kingdoms; without being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to any help, but what ariſeth from his own Dominions, of which <hi>Wooll</hi> is the Chief.</p>

his own, it was no doubt his Intereſt to Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage that of Strangers; which the Ignorance of all his Neighbours in Trade gave him opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to do: So ſtupid was the <hi>Genoees,</hi> as to believe, becauſe they had then the Money-Trade and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation of the <hi>Levant,</hi> that therefore they could ſet Laws and Bounds to other Nations, and make them pay Cuſtoms as they ſaw fit; this Exaction on Trade had the ſame effect as oppreſſion in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and drove Merchants to ſeek out bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Entertainment, and the Duke had early provided for all that would come.</p>
               <p>He was Deſpotick, and wherever that is, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Exciſe raiſes the ſureſt Revenue; and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Importation advanceth it, by the Expence of thoſe that Commerce brings into the Country; but theſe Reaſons hold not in all places, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in <hi>England:</hi> And though perchance no part of the World in general ſpeaking, is thought bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter placed for Free Ports; and no doubt it is ſo, if the Conſideration be had on Foreigners; but I cannot think it ſo, for either King or People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I expect but few with me in this, therefore muſt not paſs it over without giving thoſe Inducements that prevail with me to this belief: I begin with that relating to the Crown, <hi>Free Ports</hi> will give opportunity for running Goods, nor is it poſſible to prevent the Arts of Merchants when they have ſuch a handle as <hi>Free Ports</hi> will give them.</p>
               <p>There is no one Kingdom, not <hi>France</hi> it ſelf, that Conſumes ſo much of Foreign Commodities as <hi>England;</hi> the Duties on which are very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52493:24"/>
but if theſe Foreign Commodities were <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>odg'd in <hi>Free Ports,</hi> the Cuſtoms would ſink, and the Expence of them Increaſe; which is a double Miſchief, the Loſs of the Revenue on one hand, waſting the Treaſure of the Nation upon Foreign Commodities on the other.</p>
               <p>There is another Prejudice which <hi>Free Ports</hi> would bring to the Nation in general; and that is, they would leſſen and diſcourage our own Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, which by all means we have reaſon to promote.</p>
               <p>Now if there was <hi>Free Ports</hi> in <hi>England</hi> which lyes in the Center of the Trade of <hi>Europe,</hi> all Nations would make our Harbours their Docks and Harbours for Wintering and Laying up their Ships; and this they might do with Advantage, by Selling part of their Cargoes, which Variety and Choice will tempt ſo Luxurious and Expenſive a People as we are to Conſume; and allowing that, which perhaps will ſeldom be, That they carry off our Commodities, yet that is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for theſe Reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is no Gain to the Nation to eat up their own Product, as that would be, if Foreign Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities was ſpent in Return of our own.</p>
               <p>Then Foreign Ships carrying of the Product of the Nation, will Abate the Imployment of our own Ships and Men, and Inſenſibly Introduce them into our Carriage, which is the certain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Trade.</p>
               <p>And that which may not be leſs conſiderable than all before-mentioned, <hi>Free Ports</hi> would make our Loſs of the <hi>Northern</hi> and <hi>Sound</hi> Trade Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52493:25"/>
by Transferring it unto the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Portugueze,</hi> as well as the <hi>Dutch;</hi> for that out of our <hi>Free Ports</hi> they will be ſupply'd with ſorts of Commodities beſides their own, which is the Advantage the <hi>Dutch</hi> now have over us in that Trade.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole it appears to me, That <hi>Free Ports</hi> would only be an Improvement for Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners in their Trade, without the leaſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to us, not ſo much as the Increaſing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, as it doth where there is a General Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe; which I think is an Inſeparable Companion of <hi>Free Ports,</hi> and they of Countreys that cannot of themſelves make a Trade.</p>
               <p>I preſume none believes the <hi>Dutch</hi> to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>Free Ports;</hi> or if they were, Can they be a Preſident for us?

               <p>I have done with <hi>Free Ports,</hi> and ſhall come in the next Chapter to that which I think the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Nation, to Eſtabliſh in room of them.</p>

                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:52493:25"/>
I now come to that which I conceive may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the want of <hi>Free Ports</hi> in theſe Kingdoms; and that is, Liberty for Exports of ſuch Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities as have payd Cuſtoms Inwards: That I call Liberty, is to have all the Duty repay'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch Exports.</p>
               <p>This at firſt ſight may be thought making the whole Kingdom a <hi>Free Port,</hi> after I have been declaiming againſt having any; I confeſs that I ſhall here propoſe, will do the Work of a <hi>Free Port</hi> for the benefit of our own Trade, but not for thoſe that have too much Advantage of us already.</p>
               <p>That then I humbly offer in this matter is, That whereas now there is by Law Repayments of part of Cuſtoms upon Exporting of Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities that payd Inwards; that for the future, the whole Money payd Inwards be Repayd upon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, without any defaliation upon theſe Tearms following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That no Repayments ſhall be made, but on ſuch Goods as were Imported in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships and Men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That no Repayments be made, but on ſuch Goods as ſhall be Exported by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships and Men.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That no Repayments be made, but on ſuch Goods that have been more than Twelve Moneths landed</p>
               <p n="4">4. That no Repayments be made on any Goods damnified, or decayed. With theſe Reſervations, I think it is the Intereſt of the Nation to admit
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52493:26"/>
any Foreigners the ſame Priviledge, ſo that our own Ships have the Carriage in and out.</p>
               <p>To this I foreſee the Common Cuſtom-Houſe-Objections, What will become of the Kings Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms? Merchants will find wayes to make their Exports pay for moſt of their Imports.</p>
               <p>To this I Anſwer, No doubt there will be Arts uſed by ſome; but it is as certain, that ways may be laid down to prevent them, and much eaſier on the Exports, than was at firſt upon the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: Let that be well looked to, and Frauds upon Exports cannot eaſily be Committed; for the Trick will lye as it doth in ſome Caſes at this time: The Merchant ſaves ſuppoſe one third of his Duty, and then Ships out one third of what he payd Duty for, and by that means payes but half Dutyes, two thirds being Sold; and he pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Duty but for one, and to drive this Trade, it may be worth a Merchants while to Import, with deſign at leaſt, one third more than he In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to ſell in the Kingdom: But though this is an Inconveniency, and may be ſome Prejudice to the Revenue, yet I do not think it is of that Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, as to obſtruct a much greater Advantage to the Publick: But it will be further objected, that to Repay all the Duty payd Inwards upon the Exports, is unreaſonable; ſomething at leaſt to defray the Charge of the Officers ſhould be allow'd, and that is allowed where there is the greateſt Freedom: To this I Anſwer, That the Deſign here is to Incourage our own Navigation, and to retrieve our loſt Trades in <hi>Ruſſia</hi> and the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52493:26"/>
                  <hi>Sound:</hi> To effect which, there may perhaps be more Incouragement than this given. The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament upon other occaſions have thought fit to give Money to Incourage the Exports of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as that of <hi>Corn:</hi> And though I ſhall not preſume to direct, yet perhaps there may be found neceſſity to do ſomething of that Nature, to lay hold of Trades we have loſt: I have often thought there was the ſame reaſon for a Nation to lay out a Stock of Money to Introduce ſome Trades, as there is for a particular Perſon; and though that Objection which ſome make, That Publick Funds are alwayes Imbezled, be true; and that no Private Perſon will receive any Return for what he pays towards a Publick Benefit; Yet if the Money be Imployed in Manufactoryes, or Navigation, though the Original Money be ſunk, yet every Individual Man in the Nation is the better for it, even to the <hi>Cobler</hi> in his Stall. I might Inlarge on the many Advantages theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payments on Exports would bring to the Nation, but I ſhall ſumm them all up in,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It will Increaſe the Cuſtoms, if that be a Profit to the Nation in General, which to me is a Queſtion; but however, it is that which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the Government; and that a Liberty of Exporting, without any Charge, what Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants cannot diſpoſe of, will certainly Incourage to greater Imports, than when Men are liable to looſe both Goods and Cuſtoms, as now they in many Caſes are.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:52493:27"/>
2. It will bring a very conſiderable Advance to our Ships and Seamen; and in this there is more than at firſt ſight appears.</p>
               <p>By the Act of Navigation, it is wiſely provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That every Nation might Import into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> the Commodities of their own Countrey in their own Ships: This Liberty was fair and equal Dealing in matter of Trade; That every Countrey ſhould have the Command of their own Trade, and ſo gave no Offence; nor could we advance our own Navigation by it more, than what each Countrey had not Ships of their own to carry their Commodities; but this Liberty of Foreigners bringing their Commodities to ſeek a Market, and if they do not meet it, may Ship out what they cannot ſell, and have all the Duty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payd, ſo it be Imported and Exported in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships; this will put them upon Imploying our Ships, that ſo they may be Intitled to make our Harbours <hi>Free Ports,</hi> and it will be a very great Incouragement to them in their Trade, and as great to us to have the Carriage there, being more clear and certain Gain by the Navigation part of Trade, than by the Merchantine part of it.</p>
               <p>Theſe Bill Repayments upon Exports, will not only ſupply us with all ſorts of Foreign Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities on eaſie Tearms to compleat Cargoes for the Northern Trades we have now loſt, but alſo be a means to Increaſe the Exports of our Woollen Manufactoryes; of which we ſhall ſend Quantities abroad to places we cannot now, for want of other Commodities, to make up Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes for ſeveral Markets.</p>

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52493:28"/>
of Men for compoſing a Counſel of Trade, I ſubmit theſe reaſons:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>Mechanicks</hi> are generally Strangers to any Trades but their own, and conſequently can be no Judges and Adviſers in other Mens.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Bringing <hi>Artizans</hi> and <hi>Mechanicks</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Counſel of Trade would raiſe Diſcontents thorough the Kingdom among them of differing Trades; nothing being more Common than Men of one Trade to Interfere with another: And where any ſuch Complaint ſhall come to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of Trade, as they being in it, will Incourage them to bring, they will be Judges of their own Complaints; for that many Trades have depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance one upon another, and ſo theſe Men will naturally have Parties, as Intereſt leads them; which they acquainting their Friends and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of in their Reſpective Countreys, will create Diſſentions among <hi>Artizans,</hi> who are good Judges among themſelves in their reſpective Companies of one another in their own Trades, but ſeldom determine Diſputes in other Mens Trades, but with a Club and broken Head: Now as for the foregoing Reaſons, I think Mechanicks not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for a Counſel of Trade; ſo neither do I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Merchants in Trade proper; for though they are Superiour to underſtanding and Converſation with the former, yet they are under the ſame Temptations and Difficulties of making Parties, and Interfering with one another in their Trades; and therefore not proper Judges whilſt they are Parties, though they may be the beſt when they
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52493:28"/>
are not. A Counſel of Trade, if rightly Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, will be a Member in the Government; and in ſuch the <hi>Venetian</hi> Policy, which ſeems a good Conſtitution, allows none that are Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, that hath not been at leaſt Seven Years out of all Trade and Commerce: I have been Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Merchant, and therefore cannot be thought to leſſen the Profeſſion, though I believe no Man in the Actual Part and Converſe of Trade can be equal and different in the Determination of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Matters in Traffick: I have often had the like Reflections on our Publick Juſtice, in which, at this time, I believe we are the moſt happy People in the World, with Great and Juſt Men on the Bench; yet there hath been times when they were fill'd with Men that ſmelt too much of Barr; might it not then add to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of that Robe, if there was another ſtep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that from the Bar to the Bench? But this is not my Province: I return to the Second Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that of the Number in which moſt agree; one of a County, and one of every Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Kingdom; beſides ſome of the Miniſtry: This would be a huddle in my Opinion of no ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, unleſs they had Competent Salaryes: For Men would not looſe their time, and ſpend their Money for nothing; and the Charge would be too great for the King to pay without a Fund given by Parliament, ſo then I apprehend this large Committee is lodged here.</p>
               <p>It may now be expected that I ſhould propoſe, and that I think a better part than Controverſies, though as I alwayes uſe them where there is leaſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52493:29"/>
offence; for I do not pretend to more than giving my Opinion to be determined by better Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſo I ſhall offer my Thoughts, how a Counſel of Trade may be Eſtabliſhed for the benefit of the Nation.</p>
               <p>The Number not to exceed Nine; of which Three to be ſuch as haue been bread Merchants formerly, and of the moſt Univerſal Trades uſed in theſe Kingdoms, and the reſt of the Counſel to be compos'd of the Miniſtry, Admiralty, and Cuſtoms; the whole Counſel to ſit three times a Week, and three of them every day, to Receive, Examine, and Prepare Matters for the General Meeting.</p>
               <p>And becauſe no Man will ſpend his time for nothing; and time ſo diſpos'd, is generally valued as nothing; that therefore ſuch Sallaryes be given them, as may pay for their whole time, and give a Reputation to the Commiſſion equal to the Great work to be done by it; for ſo it is, if it be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood; it is a wonder that in a Kingdom ſo Fruitful in Offices, that which payes them all (as Trade doth) ſhould be allowed none; but it is an untoward. Reaſon that is given for it, which therefore I omit; and ſhall only ſay that by ſuch Men ſet apart for the Care of Trade. <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Sweedland</hi> have to a Wonder Inlarged their Trade and Navigation; and it is apparent, that for want of ſuch a Counſel, we have loſt great part of ours.</p>
               <p>The ſeveral Parts, Uſes, and Manage, I ſhall at large ſet forth in the Second Part.</p>

                  <hi>Of Prohibiting</hi> Foreign Commodities.</head>
               <p>IT is the Policy of all Civilized and Trading Countreys to make ſuch Goods counterband as are thought Unneceſſary and Expenſive to the Inhabitants, or hinder their own Manufactories or Native Growth; but in doing this, they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bring a worſe Miſchief on themſelves than that they deſign to remove; for as ſoon as a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment find any of their Growth or Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory Prohibited by any other, they return it with laying a greater Duty or Prohibition on ſome Commodity that Countrey ſupplyed them with before.</p>
               <p>To prevent this, Conſideration ſhould be firſt had of all their Exports to that Countrey they Intend any Prohibition againſt; and if they find that Countrey can any other wayes be ſupply'd with the ſame Commodities they us'd to ſend them, then they ſhould forbear any Prohibition, becauſe it is more prejudicial to leſſen their own Product and Labour, than to Conſume that of their Neighbours; for that time may abate, but the loſs of their own Trade and Manufactoryes may never be recovered, if the place that us'd them be either fallen into a Trade with another People for that Commodity, or the want of them brings them out of uſe; and they are never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieved: I think therefore, Prohibition ought never to be made, but on ſome extraordinary occaſion, or where there cannot be the like done
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52493:30"/>
to them: I will Inſtance but one for all in this Kingdom, and that is <hi>Flanders-Lace;</hi> though this Prohibition be of Abſolute Neceſſity, becauſe of of the great Value this Kingdom ſpends in that Commodity; yet if a due Eſtimate was made of what this Extravagancy carryes out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, it would appear, that the Prohibition is the Original and Preſent Cauſe of our Exceſs in that Commodity: There is indeed another accidental help to it, and that is our Army in <hi>Flanders,</hi> the continual Paſſing and Repaſſing of our Men gives opportunity of ſmugling the Duty, and they alſo coming over with the Faſhion about their Necks, our Apiſh Humours ſoon follows it; but yet the Prohibition is that which firſt Eſtabliſhed the Faſhion among onr <hi>Boas</hi> and <hi>Boaſſes;</hi> for it is not Perſons of the firſt Magnitude, as in former Ages that now Introduce a Faſhion, but ſuch who carry their Fortunes about them, and are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the midſt of their Eſtates, theſe have no wayes to diſtinguiſh themſelves, but by deſpiſing our own Manufactory, and the Naſty Dreſs, as they term it, of a Countrey Lady or a Citizen; though the latter is too apt to follow them in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; and becauſe they can better pay for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies, therefore they believe themſelves equally Intituled to them: And thus the Vanity runs round to the great Loſs of the Nation.</p>
               <p>Now that which to me ſeems the moſt Effectual way to Prohibit a Commodity that the Nation finds ſo Injurious, as to make a Law againſt, as in this of <hi>Flanders-Lace,</hi> or any other: For I name that Commodity, becauſe it ſtands moſt in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52493:30"/>
the way: I ſay then, to make that, or any other Prohibition effectual, would be, to lay an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition on any that uſes them: If that were done, the Miſchief would be at an end. But to make it forfeiture of them, to bring them, or placing a high Duty, which ſome think the beſt Expedient, is all Allurements, and Perſwaſive to thoſe whoſe Vanity, and (in ſome caſes) unhappy way of Living, cannot be without them, to Covet and Purchaſe them, becauſe they believe Difficulty, and hazard the Merchant runs in bringing them, will make them too dear for Common Wear: But to this it may be objected, That in many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Prohibitions are made to the end ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of our own of the ſame Nature might be uſed; and then the laying a Duty on the Conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer would be Troubleſome or Impracticable, ſince perchance the Commodities might not be diſtinguiſh'd, as it is in this of <hi>Flanders-Lace;</hi> which cannot be diſtinguiſh'd, but in ſome of the higheſt Prizes.</p>
               <p>This Objection muſt be allowed good in ſome caſes, and may be anſwer'd in others; where it is the firſt placing a high Duty upon the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, is a better way than an Abſolute Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but in the latter, where it may be anſwer'd, as in the caſe of <hi>Flanders-Lace,</hi> that the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities cannot be diſtinguiſh'd, there appears a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; and that will oblige the Government to ſome other Expedient, and I ſee none, but to conſider whether a Total Aboliſhing the uſe of <hi>Lace</hi> may be enjoyn'd: And here two things are to be inquired into.</p>

1. Whether ſuch a Law might not produce from thoſe abroad ſome ſuch effect on ſome of our Commodities?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether it will not be Injurious to our ſelves in turning a Number of our own People out of their Trades and way of Living?</p>
               <p>To the firſt, that of Provoking our Neighbours, I think it can do us no hurt, becauſe there is no Trade in the World (as I take it) that we uſe, which vends leſs of our Commodities than <hi>Flanders</hi> doth; but ſuch as they cannot be without; ſo that if we did abate the uſe of more of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and Manufactoryes, it were but juſt, and the Intereſt of the Nation; nor can they do us more hurt than they do. But to the ſecond Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</p>
               <p n="2">2. That of hindring our own People, that looks ill; and therefore, as well as I can, ſhall anſwer it; and to that end think it neceſſary to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire firſt, into the hands that are Imployed in this Work, and then whether they are capable of any other Imployment that they may get their Living by: For the firſt, Thoſe that make <hi>Lace,</hi> are of the Female Sex, Women and Children; and ſuch I think can turn their hands to another Work that would be profitable to the Nation, and ſave Money from going out; whereas this of making <hi>Lace</hi> is the occaſion of carrying Money out two wayes; one for fine Thread to make it, and the other by Importing <hi>Flanders Lace</hi> of greater Value, and finer then can be made here.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:52493:32"/>
That which our People might be imployed in, is ſpinning fine Thread; which may be done, though not the fineſt ſort, yet to Eight Shillings a pound, which would hinder the Importation of many ſorts of Thread to a conſiderable Value in the Year: This I preſume cannot be denied; but then it may be ſaid, this will require time to bring them that are bred up to other Work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can Earn their Bread; ſo that theſe People muſt be provided for, until they are brought into the Methods of Spinning finer Thread than is now made for Linnen; which in another place I ſhall ſhew is not for the Intereſt of the Nation to promote.</p>
               <p>The way then that I conceive Proviſion may be made to maintain theſe People for one year, which will be time ſufficient for their learning to Spin, is to place a ſmall Mulct by the Quarter on all ſuch as wear any ſort of <hi>Thread Lace,</hi> and that there will be enough rais'd on ſuch, to me ſeems reaſonable to believe, becauſe that the Poorer ſort of People that now wear <hi>Lace,</hi> to avoid the Tax, will leave it off; and that will make it look like a Diſcriminating Character of Poverty and Meanneſs in ſuch as formerly wore it, and upon this Tax to leave it off; and thoſe that have <hi>Points</hi> and <hi>Lace</hi> of Value, will not for a ſmall matter throw them away, as they muſt do, if they wear them not; for that Year there will be Liberty: But ſuppoſing, which there ſeems no reaſon to believe, that there ſhould be no Money rais<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d this way, is there not as much reaſon to find out ſome other way on the Exciſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52493:33"/>
or Cuſtoms for one Year, as there is for Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of the Exports of Corn? The <hi>French</hi> King payes Money to Incourage the Exports of Proviſions, and ſome other things; and there ſeems as much reaſon for this, which hath a greater proſpect of Improvement, than what he aims at in Exports of Proviſions, which is neither proper, nor poſſible for this Kingdom to do, whilſt <hi>Ireland</hi> is above Water; nor if he had all that Export which <hi>Ireland</hi> had in the beſt Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Countrey, which was in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, would it amount to that Yearly Value as our Vanity of <hi>Lace</hi> amounts to in the Imports from <hi>Flanders?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not poſſible to give a certain Eſtimate of it, becauſe it comes not through the Cuſtom-Houſe; nor can there be a near Eſtimate by the Quantities Sold, ſince there is ſuch Numbers that bring it from <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> not a Ship, or ſcarce a Man, but brings over ſome in his Pocket, or about his Neck; and there are thoſe that tell us of ſome Thouſands in the Year, that do thus: But giving all this into the account, I will only mention what I have pick't up from Obſervations made in <hi>Yarmouth, Hull, New-Caſtle,</hi> and <hi>London:</hi> In <hi>Yarmouth</hi> it is ſaid there are Five Perſous that get near a Thouſand Pounds a Year apiece by what they Import and ſent to <hi>Norwich<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> from <hi>Hall</hi> as much; at <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> more: In <hi>London</hi> it is ſaid, one Man hath in few Years got Forty Thouſand Pounds; and above Eight more that altogether get twice his Sum; all theſe may make up at a Moderate Computation
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52493:33"/>
Forty Thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum;</hi> that is, ſo much got by what they Import, allowing the Total to ariſe by Twenty <hi>per Cent.</hi> gain, which is an Extravagant Profit, when Merchants deal for Five <hi>per Cent.</hi> Profit in other Commodities; but allowing at Twenty, the Import is Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> beſides ſmaller Men and Paſſengers, which is believed to be as much: This is a Computation at random, yet with as much probability as it can bear; and in the whole, cannot be leſs than Four Hundred Thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum;</hi> they that ſee our Churches, where perchance there may be of Men, Women, and Children, Five Hundred in a Church, that have leſs or more of this Finery about them, will not think Four Hundred Thouſand Pounds worth more than is wore in this Kingdom in a Day: Now though this be a gueſs, yet what I bring againſt it in the Exports of Proviſions from <hi>Ireland</hi> is a certainty from Account of the Entries at the Cuſtom-Houſe; and there was never Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out in one Year to the Value of Three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thouſand Pound <hi>Sterling:</hi> I mention this, to ſhew how little we conſider the Intereſt and Trade of the Nation, and how miſtaken in our Account when we quarrel at a part of our ſelves, for ſo we ought to make it, for living on their Product; and at the ſame time ſee not a far greater Value than all that poor Countrey produceth, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away in <hi>Specie</hi> from us by Foreigners, ſo is this Commodity purchas'd, or with Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, which is the ſame thing, and ſo allowed by all that underſtnad Trade.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:52493:34"/>
I have been the longer on this Commodity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I name it for all that come under the head of Prohibitions; which I think not to be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider'd or underſtood, were it ſo, but in this one triffle; it deſerves no better a Name, if relation be had to the uſe of it: There is plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that what with the turn of our hands to a Commodity, as we now Purchaſe with Money from abroad, and with the preventing the Imports of Lace, the whole would add more than Six Hundred Thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> ſo the Treaſure of the Nation; and this might in my humble Opinion be eaſier done, than regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Eaſt-India-Company:</hi> I will not make compariſons as to the Gain, but wiſh I knew any one Trade, though that of the Foreign Plantations were one, that brings in Six Hundred Thouſand Pounds <hi>Sterling</hi> clear Gain to the Nation, as this might do, if the Old Proverb be allowed, that a Penny ſav'd, is a Penny got.</p>
               <p>But that I might not lye under a Vulgar cenſure in this matter, though I take it to be as much an Error (that Extravagancies in Cloaths is an Advantage to the Artizans, Manufactoryes, and Poor of the Nation) what is here propos'd doth not bar the Gayety and Expence of ſuch as delight in fine Cloaths, for that there may be other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions found out for Ornament as Coſtly as <hi>Lace:</hi> I remember when Band-ſtrings were come to ſuch Curioſity in Work, that they were wore from Five Shillings to Five Pound a Pair, and made in <hi>England;</hi> and have my ſelf, when I could not write Man, had Ribbons to one Suit to more
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52493:34"/>
than Fifteen Pounds Value: If theſe Extravagancies muſt be uſed, were it not better to have them of our own Fabrick, than from them that eat not our Bread, nor wear our Wooll, though they work too much of it?</p>
               <p>I have done on this head, when I ſay, That as the Wiſdom of the Nation makes Laws of Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, I wiſh there was effectual means to have them obſerv'd.</p>

               <p>That before I Engage in this Matter, there is a Receiv'd Opinion to be removed; and that is, that Expence of the Labour and Product of a Countrey, is the ſupport of the Artizans, and beings Riches to Men of Real Eſtates: If this was in Truth ſo, then there is not only an end of <hi>Sumptuary Lawes,</hi> but ſome other Statutes and Cuſtoms that yet hinder Abuſes, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance might otherwiſe grow amongſt us as Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans and Tradeſmen wearing Swords, that would Increaſe that Manufactory; yet in well-Governed Places, the Juſtices and Magiſtrates of Towns would bind to the good behaviour ſuch as did, if Servants and Apprentices were allowed

               <p>How the Old <hi>Sumptuary Laws</hi> of the Nation comes to be out of uſe, I could never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; nor can I think that it is that, becauſe they were found Injurious to our Tradeſmen and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactoryes, but rather the Vanity and Levity of the Nation in following the Modes of <hi>France;</hi> which taking firſt in our Courts, deſcended to Lower Ranks of People; and Merchants and Tradeſmen making a Gain by Curioſities in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, that ſoon begat a Party to ſupport them, until the Livelyhood of Numbers depended on the Manufactoryes of them: And that brings me to Inquire into the Opinion, that it is a benefit of the Nation to be Expenſive in Diet and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon that is given for it is, becauſe it Imploys the Poor, and ſupports the Farmer to pay greater Rents.</p>

               <p>I begin with that of Apparel, and that I muſt crave leave to differ with a Fam'd Author, <hi>Montaigne;</hi> who gave his Opinion on this Subject, that it would be for the Profit of the Kingdom, and take off all from Wearing Rich Cloaths, if the King and Court did not wear ſuch; though no doubt it would have that effect of taking off the People from Sumptuous Cloaths, if the Court wore plain, and ſo far do good as it reached the Common People; yet it would have an ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence where it effected the Court and Nobility, for that their Expence is a Gain to the Nation, and Incouragement to Induſtry: Not that I think it imploys the Poor more than they would be, if they worked for Exportation; but that I conceive in this matter, is that Frugality in the Court and Nobility, would bring all the Money of the Nation into their Coffers; for they ſeldom Trade; and ſo there would want Running Caſh to drive the Trade of the Nation, and then there would need no Laws to reſtrain the middle People in their Cloths, for they would ſoon come to Raggs: I think it therefore diſtructive to the Nation for Men of great Eſtates to be Parcimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, as I do for others to be Extravagant. <hi>Montaigne</hi> writ his Opinion as a Lord, and I as a Commoner: If Lords lived as Commoners, Commoners would never be Lords: And perhaps if there was no room for Ambition, there might not be ſo much Induſtry.</p>

Having paſt the Throne, and ſuch as attend it, among which I account Gentlemen of Real Eſtates, I come to thoſe which I think <hi>Sumptuary Laws</hi> ſhould reach, and they are Merchants, Artizans and Countrey-Men. I leave out Divines and Lawyers; the firſt lye under no Temptation, the latter I hope they will pardon me, if I ſay it is the beſt return they could make to diſperſe their great Gains among the Poor. But to return to thoſe, I think properly under <hi>Sumptuary Laws,</hi> Merchants, Tradeſmen, &amp;c. And for them there ſeems a double reaſon, one becauſe they know how to Imploy their Money in Trade and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factoryes; and therefore ſhould as much as is practicable, be kept from waſting their Stock on unneceſſary Expences; for that their Stock is the Seed Corn of Trade; and all Men are careful that they want not Seed for their Ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is common, therefore not regarded; but it is certainly true, that the endleſs Expence of our Artizans and Poor is the Greateſt Cauſe of the Decay of our Manufactoryes: There is a Train of Miſchiefs that attend one another in the Exceſs of People that depend on Labour; Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Shillings may find Materials to keep a Family a Moneth at Work; and the want of it not only hinders them, but puts them upon farther Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and perhaps Gaming or Debauchery.</p>
               <p>Shop-keepers arrive to a higher Exceſs before it Effects them, but yet they are often dip'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſee their Danger; and ſo it is with Merchants that are a Degree above them, uſually ſo in every reſpect, by means of their Education

               <p>I have often reflected on the Gain of Countrey-Farmers that may have a Free-hold of Forty or Fifty Pounds <hi>per Annum:</hi> Theſe Men we ſee, out of their ſmall Income, with their Induſtry in Rural Matters, ſhall be able to give good Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to their Children, have Money alwayes at Command; when a Merchant of Ten times his Fund and Appearance of Gain ſhall hardly be able to keep afloat; and for this I can aſſign no Cauſe but the difference in Expence; and yet the Merchant not accounted Extravagant; but the difference lyes in this, The Cuſtom of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey where the Countrey-Man lives is to wear plain warm Cloaths; his Wife perhaps with good Searge, himſelf with Kerſey; Twice or Thrice a Weak the Pot boyls, and the Spit us'd on Sundays.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Merchant</hi> he lives in a City, where Rich Cloaths, Lace, &amp;c. is Common Wear, and a Sett Table every day, and to be but in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Road with his Neighbours, he ſpends Five times as much as the Countrey-man; this at a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Computation amounts to a great Sum in Twenty or Thirty Years.

what I have ſaid; and my Opinion that <hi>Sumptuary Laws</hi> duely Executed would Inrich and Strengthen theſe Kingdoms: We ſee it doth ſo among our Neighbours, the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgers;</hi> where you ſeldom hear of a middle ſort of Dealer, and perhaps never of a Handi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oraft Man to fail: It is certain they ſell for leſs Profit than we do; that they looſe more in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion at Sea than we do, occaſioned by the under-Manning their Ships: Yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding theſe diſadvantages, their Merchants, and all ſorts of Tradeſmen are much Richer than ours; for which no reaſon can be given, but their Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Living, which to me is an undeniable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of the Opinion, that the larger our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in Cloaths and Food is, the better our Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans and Poor are maintained.</p>
               <p>The true way for Increaſing the Riches of the Nation in General, and the Artizan in Particular, is to Imploy them in Commodities Exported, not conſumed in the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>If what I have ſaid gain any Acceptation, the <hi>Modus</hi> for putting ſomething in Practice like <hi>Sumptuary-Laws</hi> may be admitted, and it ſhall be in few words.</p>

               <p>THere ſeems nothing that would be a more Univerſal Good, than a Proviſion for the Infant Poor of the Nation; whoſe Misfortunes ſeems not greater in their Being, than in the Proviſion that is made for them by the Pariſhes where they were born. The common Practice in the diſpoſe of them, is to pay a Poor Woman by the Year for keeping a Child; and as ſoon, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are capable of the meaneſt Service, they are turn'd off, and ſeldom put to a Trade; by which means, as their Entrance into the World is a Charge to the Pariſh, ſo is their going out in Old Age, if they come not to a worſe end; it being obſerved that moſt of the Pilfering and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant People that fill the Streets, are ſuch that are not bred to Trades in their Youth: This Evil, like Original Sin, comes into the World with theſe Miſerable People: I mean, when they are ſent out of the Pariſh, without Education, in a habit of Idleneſs, which produceth every day worſe Converſation, and leſs Shame.</p>
               <p>And if from theſe Slips comes the greateſt part of the moſt Unfortunate Poor, (ſuch I mean as come to untimely ends;) may not this then deſerve the Conſideration of the moſt Pious and Politique Heads in the Nation? It is ſtrange to ſee how provident we are to keep off little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles when they are near, and how careleſs we are of greater Miſchiefs if they be at a diſtance; We

hunt a Strange Beggar out of our Pariſhes; and if in time of Scarcity Numbers come into a City from the Country, A Common-Council is call'd, and their Grave Wiſdom ſet at Work, how to get rid of their New Comers; and yet at the ſame time, perhaps, that very City is breeding up a greater Number of Poor Children than they hunt out, to Act the ſame part in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth; that is, of Stealing, Begging, and Idleneſs, as Mankind Naturally would do, if Education Improved not Nature. The worſt of Men would keep, if they could, that part of Primitive Innocence, Eating without Labour; and are True Believers of that part in Divine Writ, That it is a Curſe to eat their Bred by the Sweat of their Brow: There needs no other Evidence of this Truth, than that of the <hi>O<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

There is no Nation I ever read of, who by a Compulſary Law, raiſeth ſo much Money for the poor as <hi>England</hi> doth: That of <hi>Holland</hi> is Voluntary, and turns to a Revenue to the Common-Wealth, as they manage it; but our Charity is become a Nuſance, and may be thought the greateſt Miſtake of that Bleſſed Reign, in which that Law Paſſed, which is the Idle and Improvident Mans Charter; for if Shame or Fear of Puniſhment makes him Earn his Dayly Bread, he will do no more; his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are the Charge of the Pariſh, and his

Old Age his Receſs from Labour or Care; he makes no Proviſion for it in the time of his Youth and Strength, becauſe he hath better Security for his Maintenance than Money of his own Laying up: But of this ſort of Poor, I deſign a Diſcourſe in the Second Part of Eſſayes on Trade, &amp;c. I am now on that of Infant-Poor; and beſides, that of the Pariſh there is another Proviſion; which for as much as it takes up, makes a fine Shew; but yet in my Opinion that Charity might be better diſpoſed, than to keep Children till they are Thirteen or Fourteen Years of Age without any Labour; and then often taken away by Gentlemen, that perhaps keep them to wait on them; or ſome other Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment that is more proper for one that hath been by Misfortune fallen from a Competency, and is too far grown to beg in a Manual Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: For this reaſon I think there ſhould not be one taken out of an Hoſpital, but to ſome Mechanick Art, or Navigation. I know there are ſome that tell us, It is pity, where an Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Boy ſhall be found, but that he ſhould be advanced according to his Genious in Learning. If our Nation did want ſuch Men, there might be ſome pretence for this Opinion, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I ſhould be ſtill againſt it; But when we ſee ſuch Exceſs of Studients, that there is not Preferment for them; we have not to the Degree of Clerks for ſome, that perhaps, if they had according to their Learning and Parts might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Preferment in Church and State; but the Stock is too many for the Paſture, and that

brings many Young Gentlemen to Misfortune, who have been well Educated, That being all their Fathers could give them; and being born Gentlemen, not ſo agreeable to ſet to Mechanical Labour, as it is for the moſt Ingenious Boy an <hi>Hoſpital</hi> can produce, his Original muſt be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from thence: And ſo a Handicraft Trade cannot be too mean for him; and if he be of Extraordinary Underſtanding, let him lay it out in Curious Arts and Manufactoryes; ſuch would be of more uſe to the Nation; and of ſuch we cannot have too many: And if there were the ſame Conduct in the Great Community of a Nation, as there is in Private Families: (And I ſee no reaſon why there may not) there would not be ſo many Thouſands in this Kingdom ſent out of their Hives without a Sting, and ſo become Drones, Living on the Labour of the Induſtrious <hi>Bee,</hi> ſo I think them that are not bred up in ſome Imployment. Now to make a laſting Reformation in this thing, I conceive it muſt be to begin at the Root; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure and Improve the firſt Sprouts as they come into the World: And that brings me to a Propoſition that was brought to ſome of the greateſt Miniſters in Church and State, where it met with ſo good a Reception, that ſome of them were pleaſed to ſay, That though they had for ſeveral Years been labouring for ſuch a thing, and had made ſome Progreſs in it, yet they could never frame a Scheme, but there was ſome objection to it; but in this they ſaw none; and therefore Reſolved upon the Kings

As far as I have Liberty to make it Publick, I ſhall ſhall here ſet down the Propoſition; That ſo if better Heads can Correct or Improve it, the Nation may have the Advantage, by Inlarging a thing which may be of ſo Publick a Benefit.</p>
               <p>The Propoſition was as followeth,</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>That a Charter be Granted to ſuch as ſhall be willing to Erect </hi>Hoſpitals<hi> and </hi>Working-Schools<hi> through the Kingdom for Poor Children, on the Terms following.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Schools</hi> and <hi>Hoſpitals</hi> taking them in at Seven Years of Age, and to teach them to Read and Write; and Imploy them chiefly in the Linnen Manufactory and Cordage; The Boys
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52493:43"/>
to be diſcharg'd at the Years of Twenty One, and the Girls at Eighteen; by which time they may be made perfect in the Art of Spinning and Weaving Linnen; neither of which are improved to the height in this Nation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That foraſmuch as it is hoped many Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable and Well-diſpoſed People will Extend their Bounty to the Poor this way; if they might ſet out a Poor Child, ſo as it may be put in a good way of Subſiſtance for its whole Life.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That theſe <hi>Hoſpitals</hi> and <hi>Schools</hi> be obliged to take in from all Perſons, Children upon Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Tearms.</p>
               <p>And foraſmuch as it may be of a more Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Benefit to the Kingdom to leave a Latitude to the Governours of theſe Working Schools, to breed up ſuch of the Boys as ſhall have a Genius to any other Mechanical Art, that then they may be ſo Inſtructed.</p>
               <p>And alſo for the better Incouragement of Youth, and ſuch as may be the Children of Parents, by Misfortune brought to Decay, that they may be ſo at the Liberty of the Governours to diſpoſe of, as ſhall be found capable, and deſir'd by Merchants, Navigators, or others, to take Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice, and breed them up in ſome Trade, ſo that it be for their Preferment, and at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the Youth.</p>

               <p n="6">6. That there be a Liberty for the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, &amp;c. to receive the Charity of all ſuch as ſhall at any time Give, or Bequeath Money or Land to this Good Work.</p>

               <p n="8">8. That theſe <hi>Schools</hi> ſhall be alwayes Free from any Tax, either for their Land or Stock that muſt be Imployed in the Work.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That there be in each <hi>Hoſpital</hi> a Miniſter to Inſtruct the Children, and Officiate in Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Affairs.</p>
               <p n="10">10. That for the better Government of theſe <hi>Hoſpitals,</hi> and to the Intent that the Work propoſed be duely purſu'd, That all Biſhops and Peers, and Members of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in their Reſpective Countys for the time being, and ſo for ever, ſucceed Viſitors of thoſe

               <p n="11">11. To Compleat the whole Deſign, and make theſe <hi>Hoſpitals</hi> and <hi>Schools</hi> the greateſt Work of Charity and Univerſal Good that ever was beſtowed on this Nation, is to Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a Fund for Stock and Portions of ſuch as go out of theſe <hi>Hoſpitals;</hi> that is, to pay as much as is paid in with the Child, and that they ſhall be free to ſet up the Linnen Manufactory in any Corporation of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>This will require an Act of Parliament, and the Fund for Portions and Stock may be Rais'd out of that which no one will Refuſe, nor yet ſhall any be obliged to pay.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THey will eaſe the Nation of a Charge and Burthen: The Charge is upon the Pariſh in breeding up the Children, and the Burthen is having Streets fill'd with Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars in their Old Age; for ſuch uſually are ſo, that are bred to no Trades in their Youth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe Schools will add to the Nation in their Trade and Manufactories, more than Twenty thouſand Perſons a Year, allowing but Two out of a Pariſh, with ſuch as may be ſuppoſed will be put in by particular perſons, that may think a Child well diſpoſed of, for a ſmall Sum to be taught a Trade, and have a Stock at going out to ſet up with.</p>
               <p>They will not only add to the Nation ſo many as come from the Pariſhes, but they will produce another Generation by Marriages: Whereas the Poor bred to no Employment, ſeldom do more than waſte away their Life in a ſingle condition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe Hoſpitals and Schools breeding up Numbers in the Linnen-Manufactory, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite over Foreigners to ſettle in the ſame Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; for that it is a Maxim in Trade and Manufactory, <hi>That where there are but few employ'd, they will be found too many; and where there are great numbers, they may be thought too few.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Theſe Hoſpitals and Schools for Linnen will by themſelves and their Increaſe ſettle ſuch a Manufactory of Linnen as will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52493:45"/>
prevent the great Sums of Money that go out of the Nation, but alſo bring in Money for ſeveral ſorts of Linnen; they will ſoon arrive to that Perfection which can never be introduc'd by the Methods now taken.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There ſeems not a more certain way for raiſing the Rents of Lands and Houſes, than advancing the Poor, and increaſing of People and Trade; both which will certainly ariſe from theſe Schools and Hoſpitals.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Theſe Hoſpitals and Working-Schools will exceed not only all the Charitable Works of this Kingdom, but may be thought above any in <hi>Europe.</hi> Former Charities ſeldom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed preſent Proviſion for the Poor, and that only to keep them ſo; but by this there will be raiſed of them which are now the Diſeaſe of the Nation, a Uſeful and Induſtrious Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: It is reaſonable to believe they will be in their ſpreading forth in the Kingdom, Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Sobriety and Induſtry; for that they will be ſtrangers to the common Vices of this Age, and know nothing but what they are bred up to in their Schools.</p>
               <p>And that this Great Work may not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry, as Publick Stocks and Manufactories al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways do,</p>
               <p>It is humbly propoſed, That a Charter may be given to ſuch as will undertake ſo good a Work; and that they may have ſuch Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement as may give them a Proſpect of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, without which the Undertaking can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſucceed; for that it is a mixt Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, a Manufactory and an Hoſpital; the

firſt to ſupport the latter, and that with ſuch Benefit to the Nation as might be wiſh'd, tho at the Purchaſe of a National Fund: But here is nothing deſired for the Maintenance of all the Poor Children of the Nation, for that the Ten Pounds to be paid by the Pariſh will not anſwer the Charge of Building and Furniſhing the Houſes; and that for a Fund to raiſe ſo much apiece when they go out, will not come to any Proportion of what muſt be paid in Fourteen Years. So that in truth the entire Succeſs of this Affair reſts on the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Stock of the Undertakers.</p>
               <p>Thus far went the Propoſitions and Reaſons for it, which to me appear'd without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, tho perhaps according to the unhappy humour of this Age ſome may be againſt it, if there appears any Advantage to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers; which is in my opinion a pernicious Principle, that hath been no ſmall prejudice to our Trade and Manufactories, diſcourages Ingenuity, and hath driven many profitable Inventions out of the Kingdom into other Countries, where they meet with better Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment: But of this I ſhall at large diſcourſe in the Second Part, and here only ſay, That I conceive one of the greateſt Miſtakes in our Proviſion for the Poor, is, That they are not put under the Charge of ſome that may be Gainers by their Work.</p>
               <p>I never ſaw Publick Undertakings in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Manufactory turn to any Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; nor do I ſee any reaſon to expect it,

whilſt it is ſo difficult for Private Undertakers to defend themſelves againſt the Frauds of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſans and Labourers in Employments their Maſters are bred in; and if it be ſo where men have both Underſtanding and Self-Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt united for their own Advantage, the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs cannot reaſonably be ſo great. Suppoſe Managers ever ſo honeſt, there are ſome Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that Publick Miniſters lye under, which men in their own Concerns are free from; that is, Set Rules and Methods which they muſt obſerve, and by that means loſe ſome Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which private men can take or leave, as they find them for their purpoſe. But that which ſeems unanſwerable in this Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, is, That the Propoſition is to breed up Children in Manufactories, ſo as to eaſe the Nation of a Charge, and repleniſh the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey with People; and this cannot be done without great Expence of Money, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of the Undertakers.</p>
               <p>And why they ſhould not have the Benefit of both, ſince it is not at the Publick Charge, none I believe can give a reaſon, but thoſe wiſe men that would have no good done that any man gets by.</p>

                  <hi>Of the</hi> New-found-land<hi> Fiſhing.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Name of a Joint-Stock and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in Trade, is in general terms thought injurious to the ſeveral Intereſts of the Nation, but in ſome Caſes it is allowed by
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52493:46"/>
all, That Companies are abſolutely neceſſary; and if in any, it ſeems to be ſo for the Fiſhing of <hi>New-found-land,</hi> which was once the moſt conſiderable Trade and Nurſery for Seamen of this Nation.</p>
               <p>How it came to be loſt by us, and taken up by the <hi>French,</hi> is viſible, and chiefly ſince the Reſtoration of <hi>Charles the Second,</hi> in whoſe Reign it was complained of, and Petitions from the <hi>Weſt</hi>-Countrey-men to retrieve it, and ſecure them from the growing Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>French,</hi> daily made upon the Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Nation; but no Care was taken, the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt being then prevalent at Court.</p>
               <p>The Iſland of <hi>New-found-land</hi> is as much the Right of the Crown, as any Foreign Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor have the <hi>French</hi> the leaſt pretence to it.</p>
               <p>But ſince they have got footing in it, no Private Undertakers are able to conteſt it with them; nor if the Government ſhould diſpoſſeſs them, would Private Undertakers be able to ſecure and maintain the Place and Trade.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> have now Forts there, and ſend ſuch Numbers of Ships Yearly, as is little leſs than a Warlike Effort added to their Trade; and by the Fiſhing they have raiſed their Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſo became formidable at Sea, all their other Navigation not employing one fourth of the Seamen their Fiſhing of <hi>New-found-land</hi> and <hi>Canady</hi> doth.</p>
               <p>And as the <hi>French</hi> have grown great in their Trade and Navigation by this Fiſhing, ſo hath
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52493:47"/>
                  <hi>England</hi> by the Loſs of it abated in both, to the weakning and Poverty of the Nation.</p>
               <p>If the Strength and Security of this Nation lies in the Naval Force, it may be thought that which makes and employs Seamen can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be bought too dear, but deſerves the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Encouragement; and then the Fiſhing of <hi>New-found-land</hi> would be as much conſider'd, and as well preſerved from Foreign Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as our other Plantations, where none are admitted to Trade but the Subjects of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It cannot be denied, however ſome may apprehend, but the Foreign Plantations add to the Strength and Treaſure of the Nation, even in that of People, which is generally thought our Plantations abroad conſume; but if it were conſidered, That by taking off one uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs perſon, for ſuch generally go abroad, we add Twenty <hi>Blacks</hi> in the Labour and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factories of this Nation, that Miſtake would be removed.</p>
               <p>But whatever the Advantages of our Foreign Plantations are to <hi>England,</hi> this of <hi>New-found-land</hi> Fiſhing will be much more, for that by it there will be Riches gain'd out of the Sea, without the Expence of any Foreign Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities; but it is not ſo in the Foreign Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>By this Fiſhing there will be no perſon, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome few to keep the Forts, taken out of the Kingdom; nor any fed or cloathed with the Product of other Parts, but all they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume will be of the Growth and Manufactory of the Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:52493:47"/>
And this Fiſhing of <hi>New-found-land</hi> will be ſupported entirely with the Product of the Nation, which no other Trade is; ſo will the Product of this Fiſhing bring in more Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion than any other Trade can: Whereas the Product of our Foreign Plantations is greateſt part conſumed in the Kingdom, and that adds nothing to the Riches of the Nation.</p>
               <p>And that which is not the leaſt conſiderable in this Undertaking, is, That whereas in all our other Plantations abroad our men are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in labour on ſhore, and ſo of no uſe in time of Naval War, this Plantation of <hi>New-found-land</hi> will be all Seamen, and moſt of them at home once a year, and may ſoon be to the Number of 10000 Men; which may be thought a greater Strength to the Nation than a Land-Army of thrice the number; with this advantage, that Seamen are always readier for Service, and yet of no Charge to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment until they are in it.</p>
               <p>And to ſum up all in that which is the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity as well as Treaſure of <hi>England,</hi> by this Fiſhing there may be added Thirty Sail of Men of War always ready for the Service of the Nation.</p>
               <p>It may perhaps be expected, That after tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling what mighty things may be done by this Fiſhing, I ſhould lay down a Scheme how it may be made practicable: But as what I have here ſaid is no more than Hints, on which bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Heads may enlarge, ſo I muſt own my want of Aſſurance to preſcribe Rules and Methods for ſo great an Undertaking, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52493:48"/>
at a Time when the Supreme Council of the Nation are ſitting, before whom I lay theſe <hi>Eſſays,</hi> as Suppliants do their Petitions, to be conſider'd of. In that nature I ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo further ſubmit ſome Particulars, which I humbly conceive neceſſary for the Eſtabliſhing this Fiſhery.</p>
               <p>I conceive that out of the National Bank before propos'd, muſt ariſe a Fund for this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, and ſuch as to Build and Purchaſe a Hundred Sail of Ships, from 100 to 300 Tun, and to carry Guns according to their Burthen, for every Ten Tun a Gun.</p>
               <p>That there be at the Company's Charge Ten Third Rates, Ten Fourth Rates, Five Fifth Rates, and Five Sixth Rates, Mann'd and Gunn'd as Ships of War. The Uſe of theſe Ships, and Charge of maintaining them to the Advantage of the Company, ſhall be made out, if demanded.</p>
               <p>That tho theſe Ships ſhall be built by <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Carpenters, yet not by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Timber; it being too evident that there will be want of that for the Navy.</p>
               <p>That there be Forts and Plantations eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in <hi>New-found-land,</hi> for Defence and Security of the Place.</p>
               <p>That no <hi>Spaniſh</hi> or <hi>French</hi> Salt be uſed in ſaving their Fiſh, there being a way to ſave that Expence.</p>
               <p>The Deſign and Advantage of this Trade being ſingular from any Trade yet in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That there ſhall be no Uſe or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of any thing, but the Product and Manufactory of the Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:52493:48"/>
That in regard there will be 20000 Perſons one way or other Employed in this Trade, and conſidering the want of People already in this Kingdom; That a Statute may be made to take out of Priſons ſuch Perſons as are kept for ſmall Debts, Fees, &amp;c. of which ſort Thouſands Periſh in Goals.</p>
               <p>And that the ſame Proviſion be made for Criminals not guilty of Murther.</p>
               <p>A Shaved Head and a Chain would be a greater Terror than a Gallows, and be a more laſting Example than the Execution of an Hour.</p>
               <p>It ſeems alſo a Puniſhment to the innocent for the nocent, that a man ſhould be loſt to the Nation for an Offence done to a private Perſon, and the Sufferer have no Reparation for what he hath loſt; whereas if the Offender were kept to Work during his Life, ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration might be made to the Perſon Injured, and a certain Gain made to the Nation by the Work of a man; and this way of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Felons would bring more to Puniſhment than Death doth, for that many chuſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to let Felons eſcape, than Proſecute where their Life is in danger.</p>
               <p>That all ſuch Offenders as are now Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported, or have Licenſe to go for Foreign Parts from <hi>Ireland,</hi> of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation, be ſent to <hi>New-found-land,</hi> by which means they would be made uſeful and of profit to this Nation; whereas by their going to Foreign Parts they are enabled to do miſchief, and ſo it hath been found in all Rebellions of that People, they
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52493:49"/>
returning back Experienced Commanders and Soldiers, which hath not been the leaſt encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to them in all their Rebellions.</p>
               <p>This Diſpoſition of the faulty <hi>Iriſh,</hi> will not only be a Gain to this Nation, but alſo a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity in taking away one handle for future Rebellions, and make them, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, Hoſtages for their Brethren in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be thought a miſtake in thoſe who think it a good expedient to ſend the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to ſerve Foreign Princes, rather than venture them at Home; great part of the Common People are ſaid to be Peaceable and eaſily led into Diſcipline, and nothing but want forceth them to Diſorder; ſuch are to be valued as a Stock in a Kingdom, where the Country is almoſt waſte for want of Inhabitants; and for ſuch as are faulty, they being ſent where Labourers are wanting, and methods taken to keep them at work, they will be of good uſe; the Baniſhing of the <hi>Moors</hi> out of <hi>Spain</hi> is a laſting monument of ill Conduct, ſufficient to warn us of the like miſtake; if <hi>a living Dog be better than a dead Lyon,</hi> it may be thought the worſt of Men are better than none; good Laws and Diſcipline may make Bad men uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in a Commonwealth, but no Human Law can Create them. There are many other things that attend this Undertaking, which in Time and Place may be offered.</p>

                  <hi>Of</hi> Navigation <hi>and</hi> Seamen.</head>
               <p>I Find more difficulty to ſay any thing on this Subject, than on any thing relating to Trade; becauſe it is a common Theme on which men of divers Underſtandings have Wrote, and few converſant in Buſineſs, but cry it up as the <hi>Diana</hi> of the <hi>Epheſians, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s <hi>Guardian Angel,</hi> and needs no Advocate; but yet though all agree in Adoration, yet ſome differ in the form, and others believe we are ſafe enough in the Poſſeſſion of it, when more fear we were never ſo near loſing it; among the Crowd I ſhall bring in my Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and leave to better Judgments the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination.</p>
               <p>That our Shipping and Navigation hath been declining for many years, is evident by the loſs of that part of our Navigation which employed moſt of our Seamen; ſo it appears if we look into the Account that was taken of all the Seamen and Ships in <hi>England</hi> in the year 1615; the Navigation of <hi>Europe</hi> was not then one third of what it is now; the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Seamen then taken, that were employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Ships of Trade, were but 11000, and of them 3000 in the <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> and Coal Trade; 1900 in the <hi>Streights, Portugal,</hi> and <hi>Southern</hi> Trade; 800 in the <hi>French</hi> Trade; 4400 in the <hi>Greenland, Iceland,</hi> and <hi>New-found-land</hi> Fiſhing; 400 in the <hi>Sound;</hi> and 500 in the <hi>Muſcovy</hi> Trade; this is demonſtration how we have declined the moſt laborious part of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52493:50"/>
our Navigation, ſince near one half of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of our Seamen in that Age, were in thoſe Trades and Navigation which we have now in a manner loſt, as that of the <hi>New-found-land, Greenland, Muſcovy,</hi> and the <hi>Sound;</hi> this ſhews the want of a Council of Trade, not only of Merchants, but of the greateſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of State.</p>
               <p>Had our Forefathers underſtood Foreign Trade as well as they did their Native, it is probable they would have made as good Laws for the firſt, as they did for the latter: They did conſider and provide, as far as the Experience of the Age allowed, for the improvement of Trade and employment of the People; we ſee what care they took againſt Monopolizers and Foreſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, what exactneſs in Proviſion for the Poor, the Aſſize of their Bread; and at the ſame time care taken that they ſhould not exact in their Wages; what Penalties they laid on ſuch as did vend or make defective Manufactories; and had they known the much greater Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs that attend the Foreign Trade of the Nation, they would have provided againſt them.</p>
               <p>For as Merchants are above the Rank of of Artizans, ſo is their Skill and opportunity to do good or harm in their Negotiations: There can be no Aſſize ſet upon their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, nor Eſſay to the Curioſity of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> or Luxury of the <hi>Levant,</hi> but they may be Limited and Preſcribed in their Trade, and it ſeems of the greateſt conſequence that they ſhould be ſo; for they often gain by that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52493:50"/>
which is the Nation's greateſt Loſs; and not only Merchants, but Seamen will chuſe, as all men naturally do, that Employment which brings Profit with leaſt Toil and Labour; and that is one cauſe of the loſs of the <hi>New-found-land</hi> Fiſhing, and <hi>Northern</hi> Trades; they were Laborious and of ſmall Gain; and therefore as ſoon as we found out the <hi>Southern,</hi> and Plantation-Trades, we left them; and the <hi>French,</hi> who followed us in Trade, began where we left off, and by that means have made themſelves ſo conſiderable at Sea; and although their Navigation hath not hitherto been ſo profitable as ours to the Merchant, yet is more conſiderable to their Monarchy, than the Effeminate Navigation of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Southern</hi> Trades; for that 1000 <hi>l.</hi> in the <hi>Northern</hi> and Fiſhing Trade employs more men than 20000 <hi>l.</hi> in the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>Southern</hi> Trades. This conſideration may be thought to affect <hi>England</hi> more than any part of the World; for that we are nothing on Shore longer than we Command the Seas; and our neglect and loſs of the rougher part of the Navigation in the Fiſhing and <hi>Northern</hi> Trades, abates near one half of the Seamen that might be Employed in theſe Kingdoms; and nothing but the hand of the Government can retrieve this loſs by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging the pooreſt part of Navigation, though moſt conſiderable as to increaſe of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which is the Strength of the Nation; and this cannot be done but by ſuch Banks as will Intereſt all the men of Eſtates in the Kingdom one way or other in the Navigation and Trade of the Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:52493:51"/>
But of Banks I ſhall ſay ſomething apart, and therefore now return to that of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation and Seamen, in which, I believe, we cannot exceed, though upon occaſion of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing a way to increaſe the number of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men it was ſaid, and for that reaſon rejected, That the methods propoſed would make too many Seamen; that which then, and ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails with me to believe that we cannot have too many Seamen, though that ſhould happen which was objected, and to me ſeems very remote, that there would be want of Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men for Rural Employments, is, becauſe that if we had more than our own Navigation could Employ, yet they would not want Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in Foreign Ships, and what they get Abroad would be moſt of it brought Home, as now what Foreign Seamen get here, they carry Home into their own Country, and our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen</hi> are not ſo apt to quit their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as Foreigners are, who change for the better, and ours muſt for a worſe, if they did at all: But to anſwer what was ſaid, That we muſt hire Plowmen from Abroad, if we take up our Countrymen for the Sea; allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the aſſertion (which perchance few will) yet I conceive it were the Intereſt of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make the change, for that every Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Abroad might reaſonably be ſuppoſed to return 10 <hi>l. Sterling</hi> of his Wages <hi>per Ann.</hi> into his own Country; for home, generally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they will come, and the Plowmen we fetch from other Countries whatever they get muſt be ſpent where they Earn it, their Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52493:51"/>
being ſeldom more than Feeds and Cloaths them, whereas a Seaman's is more than double, for he ſpends nothing at Sea.</p>
               <p>If what I have ſaid be allowed Anſwer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to the Objection, That we may have too many Seamen, I ſhall proceed to ſhew, that we now want at leaſt as many more as we have. The meaſure I make for our Seamen is in Two particulars.</p>
               <p>The firſt is the Numbers we Employ in the Navy.</p>
               <p>The other is in thoſe Employed in our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantmen.</p>
               <p>For the Firſt; It is too evident that there is great part in the Fleet are Land-men, and others that have nothing more to nominate them Seamen, than the Rowing in a Wherry; and however ſhift is made with them, yet I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it would be more pleaſing to any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander to have Men that could Top and Yard, and able to take his Trick at Helm, and perchance there may not be above one half in moſt Ships.</p>
               <p>For Merchantmen there need no greater demonſtration of their want, than the lying of ſo many Ships by the Walls, and ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to keep men from Preſs that go to Sea, and ſo many <hi>Portugal, Genoeſe,</hi> and other Free Ships Employed by our Merchants; which is not only occaſioned by the advantage of their being Free Ships, but alſo by the want of Seamen to Sail our own Ships.</p>
               <p>Now there is a Third inducement for the increaſe of the Numbers of Seamen we want,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52493:52"/>
or at leaſt Navigation and Trade to Employ them, and in this we have different reaſons from any part of <hi>Europe;</hi> other Countries may encourage Seamen for their advantage in Traffick, but we muſt enlarge and encourage Numbers for our Security, and ſhould ſeek out Places for Trade and Navigation that might give conſtant Employment for as many Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as might at leaſt Balance the Numbers of the <hi>French,</hi> if we cannot arrive to that of the <hi>Dutch;</hi> it will be no offence to walk with as good a Sword by my Side as my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
               <p>To clear this matter, let us look into a Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation that was as exactly made as private Correſpondency with Merchants could do it, in the year 1687. of the Numbers of Seamen then in <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and it was thus:</p>
               <p>That in <hi>England</hi> there were not more than Forty thouſand Able Foremaſt men; in <hi>France</hi> more than Sixty thouſand; in the <hi>United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces</hi> more than One hundred and twenty thouſand.</p>
               <p>If this compute be true, as we may ſuppoſe it near the matter, it may be thought there hath been no Conſideration of late years of the moſt important Affair of the Nation, and therefore the more reaſon to mind it now; and if the <hi>French</hi> were then Superiour to us in their Numbers of Seamen, they are much more now, for that Naval War increaſeth their Numbers by Privateers, and abates ours who depend only on Trade, and that fails in time
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52493:52"/>
of War; Privateers we have not many, and thoſe few we had, it is ſaid, have met with great diſcouragements, of which there are many Inſtances given, which I dare not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to mention, ſince that matter hath been under the Conſideration of the Parliament; but the blame hath been laid on the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners of the Priſes, who, if we believe thoſe concerned in Privateers, and others conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in Maritime Affairs, are no great Maſters in that of Trade and Navigation. If then what is here ſaid be <hi>tanto,</hi> may it not deſerve a thought how to enlarge, or at leaſt retrieve that part of the Navigation we have loſt in the Trades beforementioned, which if regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will Employ Twenty thouſand Seamen, and beſide the Profit they may bring to the Nation, would be a Sea-Militia for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of theſe Kingdoms, beyond any we can have on Land.</p>
               <p>And one man Employed at Sea adds more to the Treaſure and Employments of the Poor, than five on Shore, beſides repleniſhing the Kingdom, Seamen being like Decoy-Ducks, going abroad in better circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces than moſt People in other Parts of the World do, invite others to return with them to a Place where they are better Fed and Cloathed than they are in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; and it is reaſonable to believe, were our Laws for Naturalization and Freedom for Strangers but correſpondent to the other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages this Kingdom allows to any that are
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52493:53"/>
Induſtrious, we ſhould ſoon increaſe our Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
               <p>It now remains I ſhould ſay ſomething of ways and methods how to make Seamen; for I think it preſumption to propoſe encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for them we have, ſince His Majeſty hath been gracionſly pleaſed to recommend that to the Parliament.</p>
               <p>But how to encreaſe our Numbers may not be Offenſive or Officious, if Reflections on the Pains ſome have taken to publiſh their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions in that matter renders not this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent; but its not being ſo Voluminous may, 'tis hoped, prevail for its excuſe.</p>
               <p>What I ſhall then offer is:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt;</hi> Agreeable to what I have ſaid before, that our loſt Fiſhings and <hi>Northern</hi> Trade be reſumed, and that being National will have ſuch encouragement as ſhall in ſome meaſure force men to come into it, I mean by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Gain and Profit to Seamen; for that no human Policy and Law can bring men into Arts with Succeſs, and the increaſe of them, but by Gain, and ſecurity of enjoying it; and therefore I cannot underſtand how pulling men out of their dwellings to bring them into the Fleet can make Seamen; I would gladly hear a reaſon why we may not with as much eaſe Man our Fleet without Force, as the <hi>Dutch?</hi> or whether ever they uſed ſuch me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods as theſe Gentlemen propoſe for getting Seamen? It is true we cannot expect men to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52493:53"/>
come in voluntary for the King's Pay, whilſt the ſcarcity of Seamen obligeth Merchants to give double the Wages of the King's Pay; but if we had double the Seamen, that would abate; and the way to have them, I conceive, is to put in practice ſomething like that propoſed three years ſince, which was, That there ſhould be publickly aſſurance given, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever entred himſelf into Sea-ſervice, that was never at Sea before, ſhould be free from Preſs for Three years, by which means there would be Numbers of luſty Young men that want Employment, enter themſelves in Merchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and Bind themſelves to Maſters of Ships, who would ſoon make them Foremaſt-men for their own Profit: and more would come in time of War, when they want Work at many Trades, than in time of Peace; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great encouragement for them to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from Preſs for Three years, in which time they might hope for a Peace.</p>
               <p>Nor would this obſtruct Manning the Fleet, for that it exempts none that are now Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, nor would be if this encouragement made them not ſo; and this bringing in New Men would daily add to the Fleet; for that as New Men increaſed, thoſe that were Seamen before Employed in Merchantmen, might be ſpared out of Merchant Ships, who with one fourth Foreigners, as the Act allows, and theſe New Men, might with one third of Old Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men be Navigated.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:52493:54"/>
And the way to prevent Collering Old Seamen under the notion of New, is eaſie and infallible, as was beyond Objection, even to them that encouraged not this Propoſal, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated.</p>
               <p>If this expedient be not approv'd, it may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance ſet better heads on more proper means, for that there ſeems a neceſſity to provide for Trade againſt times of Peace, as well as now for the Navy in time of War; and in my humble Opinion, there can be no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo effectual to make Seamen, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from Men of War for ſome Time.</p>
               <p>Inventions to find out concealed Seamen, ſeems to me an antidote againſt making New; Force and Projects may be uſeful to make an ignorant ſervile People Slaves, but can have no good effect with thoſe that know better, and will not be ſo; there needs no trick to promote the true Intereſt of a Nation, every man will run into it; and he would be a States-man worthy of Honour that did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Intereſt of his Country above that of their Neighbours.</p>

                  <hi>Of</hi> Building Ships.</head>
               <p>HAving in few words, for ſo they are if regard be had to the Subject, done with Navigation and Seamen, I come to that of Building Ships; and ſome think we are in danger of wanting them for Merchantmen.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52493:54"/>
For the Fleet none doubts but to an extremity we do, and that lies before thoſe who can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupply it; but that we want Merchant Ships ſufficient for our Trade, I am afraid we don't, I wiſh we did; but whilſt ſo many Ships lye by the Walls, it is no great ſign we do; and this was our caſe before the War, more than now, which may be anſwered by the loſs of our Ships this War; but that ſeems not ſufficient, there being allowance for all, and yet too plain that we want not Ships for the Trade of <hi>England</hi> if we had a Peace to morrow, which is a misfortune that the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath not ſo much Trade left them as to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy one half the Seamen their Neighbours do; and until we have at leaſt always in Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as many as the <hi>French,</hi> there ſeems no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to theſe Kingdoms; but it is hoped there will be ways found to Employ them, as there ſoon will be when thoſe Trades we have loſt are retrieved; and if the Great Councel of the Nation thinks it neceſſary, no human Hand or Policy can hinder them, either in that, or any other Trade of the Nation, if it be taken in hand in time. What can withſtand a People that outdoth all Kingdoms in <hi>Europe</hi> in Taxes, without Complaints and Famine, as they have in other Countries? A Fifth part of one years Tax might be ſo laid out, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer and ſecure that we moſt want: But to come to the Propoſition of Building Ships, there are two difficulties ſtarted in this matter; one is, that the Timber of the Kingdom is
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52493:55"/>
much waſted, and cannot hold out long.</p>
               <p>The other is, that Timber from <hi>Norway</hi> is not to be purchaſed by us at ſuch eaſy rates as the <hi>Dutch</hi> have, and conſequently cannot Build ſo Cheap as they do; now though there is truth in both theſe Objections, yet are raiſed on another occaſion, that of the Act of Navigation; yet I ſee no great weight in it as to the uſe they would make of it, that is to ſhew the neceſſity for the Nation to buy Ships of the <hi>Dutch;</hi> I confeſs to my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the reaſons they give, turn upon them; and were there nothing more but what they offer againſt the Act of Navigation in that point, it is enough to ſhew the good of that Act; but of this I ſhall ſpeak apart, and return to the Building of Ships.</p>
               <p>That there is nothing of greater conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to a people that live by Trade, than to be makers of their own Tools by which they work, none will deny; now Shipping are the Tools and Utenſils of the Nation; to fetch them from abroad is to Trade by Licence; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our <hi>Northern</hi> Neighbours pleaſe, we muſt lye ſtill, or pay ſuch rates as they pleaſe, that ſhall be equal to a Tax on our Trade; for this reaſon I conceive it worth a conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on how to find out an expedient; and that, with ſubmiſſion to better Judgments, I ſhall propoſe, is either or both of theſe ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Act of Navagation, for that part of it relating to Timber and Naval Stores, be diſpenced with for three years, and that all
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52493:55"/>
Cuſtoms, Port and Town Duties be taken off for that time on Timber, &amp;c. relating to Building and Fitting Ships to Sea; this will tumble in Materials faſt enough, perchance to a glut, if the following propoſition be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally purſued; that is,</p>
               <p n="2">2. To give ſuch Encouragement for raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Naval Commodities, as Pitch, Tar, Hemp, &amp;c. in our Foreign Plantations, as may advance that Trade to more than our own Conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if this were done, it would make the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> Princes abate their Impoſitions they have lately laid on their Commodities, and ſet them upon all ways of furniſhing us ſo cheap, as might render our attempts of raiſing them our ſelves unprofitable; and let it ſucceed to their expectation or not, the effect would be to our advantage; and the ſucceſs to either, time will ſhew.</p>
               <p>The next thing then that is to be enquired into, in this matter, is, How our Plantations ſtand as to the natural Product of theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, and how provided with hands to Manufacture them.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, I can ſay ſomething upon my own Obſervations in <hi>America,</hi> That <hi>New England</hi> is Superior to any of the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> Crowns for Timber and Maſts, Pines and Firr, to make Pitch and Tarr, for Soil to raiſe Hemp, and well enough for making Iron.</p>
               <p>But there ſeems ſome difficulties in the want of hands to work and ſupply, that is the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52493:56"/>
only Objection I ſee in this Affair; and altho that hath been too great for particular men to undertake, yet may not, tho if undertook by a publick Fund; which perchance upon a thorough conſideration may be found neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be done upon ſome ſuch Inducements as theſe.</p>
               <p>It would make <hi>New England,</hi> of the moſt uſeleſs and unprofitable Plantation of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the beſt and moſt advantageous to this Nation. I might enumerate many particulars, but I preſume this will come into hands that need no more than to put them in mind of the Place and Product.</p>
               <p>That <hi>New England</hi> lies better for a Market to <hi>Spain, Portugal,</hi> and the <hi>Levant,</hi> than the <hi>Northern</hi> Crowns, who now furniſh that part of <hi>Europe</hi> with thoſe Commodities <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> can furniſh.</p>
               <p>That eſtabliſhing this Trade will Employ many Ship-Carpenters and Seamen, which I cannot omit, whereever it comes in my way, to ſay, is the Treaſure and Strength of theſe Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>That this Trade will occaſion the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of more Woollen Manufactories than all our Foreign Plantations, it being a Cold Climate, and Men with hard Labour wear out much Cloaths.</p>
               <p>That there will be room and reaſon to give great encouragement for Foreigners to ſettle in this Plantation and Undertaking, which next to our Seamen, ſeems of moment to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52493:56"/>
which even thoſe that are againſt at home, will not be when they are abroad.</p>
               <p>And to ſum up all: As this Plantation may ſave the Nation the Expence they are now at in purchaſing Naval Stores, ſo it will bring in conſiderable returns in Bullion for what they ſend into the <hi>Levant, Spain,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And that this may not appear as a <hi>Chimera,</hi> it is to be noted, That there hath been many years ſince ſeveral Ships loaden in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> with Maſts, &amp;c. for the <hi>Streights;</hi> but for the Reaſons before given, (the want of Hands, and Publick Encouragement) that Trade did not proſper. Merchants do not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a Trade that takes up much Time and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Stock, as the <hi>Lumber</hi>-Trade doth, which is more profitable to the Ship and Men than the Merchant; and it is a miſtake in thoſe that think Merchants are always Owners; perhaps they have leaſt ſhare in the Ships of <hi>England.</hi> Having thus given ſome ſew Hints, for they are no more, if compar'd with what is to be ſaid on this Copious Subject, it may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that I ſhould ſay ſomething of the <hi>Modus</hi> for ſetting up this Manufactory, and building Ships in <hi>New-England:</hi> To ſet down an Exact Scheme, would take up more Sheets than I deſign Lines in this Place; but ſomething I ſhall mention.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To carry on this Work, it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that extraordinary Privileges be given to Foreign Proteſtants that will inhabit there, as having Land given them, free Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52493:57"/>
greater Wages than they can have in their own Countries, Houſes for ſome time Rent-free from all manner of Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That ſuch Encouragement be given, as may invite the Natives to work: They are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ingenious and docible, but naturally averſe to Labour; yet I have ſeen ſome of them take great pains in working Curioſities; and that which induceth me to believe they would work if they were ſure of good Wages, is the great labour they take in making their <hi>Wam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pompeeg,</hi> of which the moſt skilful and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious amongſt them cannot make above Two Shillings a day: Now if theſe men could have ſo much a day for any other work, it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to believe they might be brought to it, and by that means they would be better cloath'd than thoſe that are idle, and that would tempt them in alſo. But to this may be objected, That this dear Wages would make thoſe Commodities dear: To which I anſwer, That there is ſome works in Falling, Floating, and Drawing Timber, that cannot be had cheaper; and that there are no men will ſooner learn the beſt labour than they; and as the Countrey fills, and the <hi>Indians</hi> are brought to work, Wages will fall.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There may be <hi>Negroes</hi> brought, whoſe labour will come cheap; and their very little Children will be very uſeful in peeling Hemp, picking <hi>Oacum,</hi> and other things about Pitch and Tar.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:52493:57"/>
This Undertaking being thoroughly mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, will be ſuch a Staple for Shipping and Naval Stores, as no part of <hi>Europe</hi> can exceed, and put theſe Kingdoms out of the Power of their Neighbours, in that of their Naval Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions; and our Ships may be cheaper built than in any part of <hi>Europe,</hi> with the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of preſerving the Timber of <hi>England</hi> for the Royal Fleet.</p>
               <p>I have often wondred that ſuch a diſpoſition as this hath not been thought on for that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Plantation, which now brings no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to this Nation, but to the contrary bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Numbers of Induſtrious People in a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, that produceth nothing but Proviſions to feed them; and yet the moſt uſeful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities in it for the Nation, being that which makes our Walls and Bulwarks. This neglect is ſuch as was in this Kingdom in exporting our Wool; which was conſider'd by that Wiſe Prince <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, who thereupon paſs'd a Law for encouraging Foreign Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers, and that they ſhould ſettle in what part of the Kingdom they pleas'd: A good Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for giving all the Encouragement and Immunities imaginable, to invite Foreign Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters and others into a Plantation, that might raiſe ſuch Commodities as are the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our Wealth and Security.</p>

               <head>Of the Act of Navigation.</head>
               <p>TO write upon this, is to enter upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy in Trade, which I think doth as little good as that in Religion, and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly undertook, or at leaſt ſtarted by thoſe that have leaſt ſhare in the Practice. I have never been ſo attach'd to my own Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as to conclude thoſe in the wrong that differ with me; but I muſt own my ſelf a great Votary to the Act of Navigation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving it the Sea <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the only Law that ever paſt in <hi>England</hi> for the ſecuring our Trade and Navigation; and I had like to have ſaid, with it our Religion, Laws, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties too; for that no men in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are more averſe to Popery and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power than they are: And altho I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve we can never add too many to our Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber on Shore, yet perhaps it may be the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Nation to keep as many <hi>Engliſh</hi> in our Sea-Employments as we can; for that they are in truth our Guards; and tho when Naturaliz'd, and Inhabitants, Foreign Seamen may be uſeful, yet ſo as that they may be but a ſmall Proportion to the whole Number of Seamen in our Trade and Navigation. It is obſervable, that notwithſtanding the States in <hi>Italy</hi> are inſeparably united in their Force at Sea againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> yet they are ſo jealous of each others Growth in that Strength, that they are oblig'd to each other not to exceed
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52493:58"/>
the Number of Galleys they are by Compact allowed to have. This provident care of theirs might put us in mind of our Neighbours, and that we have no reaſon to declaim againſt the Act of Navigation, that doth only encourage our own Seamen, and that we have reaſon to do, ſince we have no Compact with thoſe about us to reſtrain their Growth at Sea, but every Government enlarge as much as they can.</p>
               <p>And whatever reaſon they have for it, we have more both as to our Trade and Safety. One reaſon that is given why there are no Beggars in the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> is becauſe of the Multitude of Seamen; none gives more Employment to the Poor than Seamen, their own Conſumption of the ordinary Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, beſides the ſmall Adventures of them they carry abroad; but I think it needleſs to enter upon the Benefits we receive by the Act of Navigation; we are in poſſeſſion of it, and therefore have only to anſwer the Charge laid againſt it, and I take them all to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under Four Heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That by the Act of Navigation we have loſt ſeveral Trades, as the <hi>Muſcovy, Greenland, Norway,</hi> and in great meaſure the Trade into the <hi>Sound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Act of Navigation hath raiſed the Wages of Seamen to the great Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Merchants.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That by the Act of Navigation we have very much leſſened the Building of Ships.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:52493:59"/>
4. That by the Act of Navigation we have totally loſt ſome Trades, becauſe they of that Countrey have no Shipping, and Strangers of other Countries cannot bring their Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities. Theſe are the ſeveral Topicks upon which all is ſaid that I can find againſt the Act of Navigation. I ſhall begin with the firſt:</p>
               <p>That by it we have loſt the <hi>Muſcovy</hi> Trade. This is ſaid, but no Reaſon or Inſtance given to evince how, as there is for ſome of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; and ſince they can give no reaſon, I can find none our of the Act of Navigation; but other Reaſons there are how we come to loſe that Trade.</p>
               <p>One is the heavy Cuſtoms plac'd on Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities brought from Foreign Parts, which is in conſequence a Prohibition to their Exports from us to any other Countrey: The <hi>Dutch,</hi> who court Trade as their Miſtreſs, lay their Cuſtoms ſo that they can export them again with little Charge; and the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Trade requires variety of Commodities in a Cargo which we have not proper for that Countrey of our own Product, and our Cuſtoms hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhipping out any: This put that Trade with Advantage into the hands of the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Charles.</hi> the Firſt, and they taking the Advantage of the Civil Wars in <hi>England,</hi> repreſented us under ſuch Characters to that Court, that no <hi>Engliſh</hi> for ſome time durſt appear there. Theſe are the true Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of our Lofs of the <hi>Maſcovy</hi> Trade<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52493:59"/>
Act of Navigation, which was made ſome years after.</p>
               <p>It is further ſaid, By it we have loſt the <hi>Greenland</hi> Trade, but appears not by any thing that is offered, but that the <hi>Dutch</hi>-built Ships are cheaper, and ſail'd with fewer men: It is true, <hi>Dutch</hi>-built Ships are cheaper, but as true that an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-built ſhip will laſt twice as long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So then I cannot find the odds, but that the ſailing with fewer Men is an Argument for the <hi>Greenland</hi> Trade, ſhews their being Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to that Trade, who bring it for a reaſon, becauſe the <hi>Greenland</hi> Fiſhing obligeth the Ships to carry Five times the number that would ſail her, to be employed in their Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops when they come to the Fiſhing. So then there is no advantage by the Number of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to ſail a Ship to <hi>Greenland,</hi> when they are forc'd to carry ſo many for their Fiſhing.</p>
               <p>But for diſcourſe ſake, to ſee if any thing could be made of this Argument, allowing it was as they miſtake, that a <hi>Dutch</hi> Ship and Men can fiſh cheaper than we; yet where is the Argument, That therefore <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> go not at all? It is equally alike to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whether they manage it dearer or no; for they ſet their Rates accordingly; ſince by the Act of Navigation the <hi>Dutch</hi> nor any other Nation can bring into <hi>England</hi> the Product of that Fiſhing, but upon paying double, Aliens Duty. So that I can ſee nothing in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but believe we have loſt that, with other <hi>Northern</hi> Navigations, by our <hi>Southern</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:52493:60"/>
Trade, being more pleaſant and profitable Voyages for Seamen, and ſo wanted Men for our leſs profitable Trade; and we ſhould for ſome other Trades we yet hold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as that of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia,</hi> and the little we have left of the <hi>New-found-land</hi> Fiſhing, if the Act of Navigation did not ſecure them. There ſeem'd for theſe Reaſons, no doubt, grounds for the Act of Navigation, to confine this Trade to our Ships and Seamen, as much as they could; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it would certainly have fallen into Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign hands: And according to my ſenſe of Trade, it were better for the Nation to have neither Whale, nor Oyl, nor Whalefin, than to have them by Purchaſe from Foreigners.</p>
               <p>I make this diſtinction, That there is no Gain to the Nation by what is conſumed in it; and neither of theſe Commodities are exported.</p>
               <p>The next Objection is, The Loſs of the <hi>Norway</hi> Trade; and in this there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but I cannot ſee ſo great a miſchief in it, as is repreſented, but that which may be remedied by a diſpenſation for employing <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships in that Trade, ſo they be ſail'd by <hi>Engliſh</hi> men; for that I conceive is the great deſign, and of more value than all the reſt in the Act of Navigation; for that in moſt of our Trades, <hi>Engliſh</hi>-built Ships are uſed, and <hi>Dutch</hi> not proper; ſo there needs no force when it is done of choice: But that which may put an end to this Exception in the Act of Navigation, and moſt of the <hi>Northern</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:52493:60"/>
Trade is propos'd in the foregoing Eſſay of Building Ships.</p>
               <p>That which is objected of hindring our Trade in the <hi>Sound,</hi> hath nothing in it, when at the ſame time it appears, that of Seven Ships a year ſent there, Five goes in there Ballaſt.</p>
               <p>That we have loſt our Trade into the <hi>Sound,</hi> is plain from the variety of Commodities the <hi>Dutch</hi> carry in one Ship; and we commonly carry the Product of <hi>England,</hi> which is one of our Miſtakes in Trade, that for fear of a ſmall loſs in the Cuſtoms, we loſe ſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a Trade as we do in the <hi>Sound,</hi> and <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern</hi> Kindoms: But of this, ſomething ſhall be ſaid apart. And ſo I have done with the firſt Head in relation to the Act of Navigation, which better Judgments may determine, but in mine there is nothing appears to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the Act.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Objection againſt the Act is, That it hath raiſed Sea-mens Wages, ſo that Merchants are now at the Mercy of Seamen, who raiſe their Wages at pleaſure, and ſo impoſe upon Trade, to the diſcouragement of Merchants: All this I know to be literally true; and allowing the Matter of Fact, we will ſee what Inferences are made from it: They that are againſt the Act of Navigation, bring it for demonſtration, and it is ſo, That Seamen have ſince raiſed their Wages, and that is a Prejudice to Trade: Now to make this matter clear to every Underſtanding, it may be needful to ſhew, that in this there is two
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52493:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
handles, both to be laid hold on in Argument, one is the Profit of the Merchant, the other is that of the Publick and National Intereſt.</p>
               <p>The Complaint lies thus; Before the Act of Navigation, Merchants had Seamen at eaſy and low Wages; this was their Gain, and the Foreign Seamens Profit, who carried their Wages out of the Kingdom, and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in Money.</p>
               <p>The Act of Navigation bars theſe Foreign Seamen from ſailing entirely in our Ships, that is, from being the whole Crew; for one fourth of Foreign Seamen the Act allows; which I think is the only miſtake in that Statute, to give Foreign Seamen any room in our Ships: But thus it ſtands, By excluding Foreign Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ours have rais'd their Wages, and that is a loſs to the Merchants, I mean it is ſaid ſo; but that is equally a miſtake with the reſt; for Merchants will rate their Goods according to their Charge; and it is the Conſumer, not Importer, that pays it: But allowing the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as it is ſaid, the Merchant he gets by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Foreign Seamen, the Nation gets by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying our own Seamen; which of thoſe is to be encouraged, I think can be no queſtion among <hi>Engliſh</hi>-men.</p>
               <p>I confeſs, amongſt all the Arguments that I have heard made uſe of, this of Seamen was moſt ſurprizing, becauſe I always thought it the greateſt Authority, and invincible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Act of Navigation. It ſhews the Neceſſity for a Law to make Seamen,

when you have not Three fourths to ſail your Merchant-men; for as before is ſaid, the Act allows of making uſe of one fourth Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and yet we ſee the Merchants complain for want of more. If theſe Gentlemen that are diſpleaſed with the Act of Navigation, would but conſider the Condition of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all parts of its Trade and Navigation, I perſuade my ſelf they would be Advocates on the other ſide, for their Diſcourſe ſhews them men of Ingenuity, and well-affected to their Countrey; and tho I will not pretend to convince them by dint of words, yet I do not deſpair of doing it, by laying before them the State of the Nation in this Particular, when this Act was, and was firſt thought on, in the time of the <hi>Rump</hi>-Parliament, thus, as I find it by Story and Relation of ſome that were Merchants and Commanders at Sea in that time: The <hi>Rump</hi>-Parliament quarrelling with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> took the opportunity of making Trade the chiefeſt pretence for it, believing that would be Popular, and affect <hi>England;</hi> and the truth is, there was ground enough for Quarrel in matters of Trade; the <hi>Dutch</hi> grew very faſt upon us all the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt; and it is a miſtake to ſay that we loſt our Trade into the <hi>Sound</hi> and <hi>Muſcovy</hi> ſince the Act of Navigation; for it was ſtealing from us the year 1634, and was in a manner quite loſt by the year 1652: But that which moſt affected, and gave offence to the Nation, was, the <hi>Dutch</hi> had got ſuch a Trade to our
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52493:62"/>
Plantations in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> that we could ſcarce get ſo much Sugars home, as the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſum'd; they ſupplied our Plantations with Wines and Brandies, Linnen, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every thing they ſpent in the Iſlands. This being ſo notorious, the then Government thought upon the Act of Navigation, which had good effect in preſerving that part of our Trade and Navigation that was left; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps we owe at this day the Preſervation of theſe Kingdoms to it; for that upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, had not this Act lain in the way, there might not have been ſuch courſe taken as there was in our Trade and Navigation: The diſpoſition of thoſe times ſeem'd to tend another way, for Pleaſure more than Trade; but this Act ſtood as a Centinel for the Traffick of the Nation, and put them in mind of other things.</p>
               <p>I have now brought this Act to the year 1660. and let us ſee how the Trade of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtood then.</p>
               <p>Upon the Reſtoration of <hi>Charles</hi> II. there was a Set of People in Trade, that had been bred up in it in the time of the Parliament, and theſe Men having the Money, as well as the Trade of the Kingdom in their hands, were at that time eaſier heard than they have been ſince. They not knowing what force Foreign Money might have at Court, thought themſelves never ſafe until they got the Act of Navigation confirm'd; and being early in their Application, they ſucceeded to their own Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52493:62"/>
with ſome Advantages more than was in the former Act. For it is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, That under <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Government, the Act of Navigation had little force; both the Government, and the Merchants, were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to let it ſleep; for that during the War with <hi>Spain,</hi> to avoid their Privateers, which were ſo numerous, that ſcarce a Ship could ſtir without a Convoy, moſt of our Trade was managed in <hi>Dutch</hi> bottoms, they being at Peace with <hi>Spain;</hi> this Management had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſtifled the Act of Navigation, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants finding their preſent Gain by the cheapneſs of <hi>Dutch</hi>-Sailing, did not conſider the future Conſequence, immediate Gain was what they minded: But upon the Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſame men that under the Uſurp'd Government were content with the General Scramble of the Nation, and to come in for a Share, were now for ſecuring Trade to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, which they were careleſs of, whilſt they had no Foundation of Law or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>I have been the larger in this Account, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I find it generally believ'd, That this Act of Navigation was originally brought forth in prejudice to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and for the ſame reaſon renew'd in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the II. whereas in truth it was at firſt made with as much reaſon and neceſſity as our Laws againſt Exportation of Wooll; for neither that nor any thing elſe can with reaſon be thought our own, longer than our Ships and Seamen have
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52493:63"/>
the Guard of it, and that they cannot have, unleſs they have the Carriage; and if that be allow'd, which I ſubmit, then the <hi>Second</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt this Act, That it raiſes the Wages of Seamen, will not be found material, but rather be, as indeed I think it, the beſt Argument that can be given for the Act of Navigation; if Seamen be our Guards, as well as Labourers; and Foreign Seamen by their cheap Sailing have ſo beaten out ours, that we have not ¾ to ſail our Ships in time of Peace, ſure it was time to conſider of a way to increaſe and incourage our Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Objection made againſt the Act of Navigation, is, That it hinders the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Ships; this I confeſs would have weight in it, if it were poſſible to be true, which to me it doth not appear, no more than becauſe I cannot get brown Bread, I will ſtarve rather than eat white: <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships are cheaper, and fail'd with fewer Men, and conſequently can bring Lumber for building Ships cheaper than <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> can; and becauſe we cannot fetch theſe Materials at ſo eaſy rates, therefore we will be ſullen, and neither fetch nor buy of the <hi>Danes</hi> or <hi>Sweeds,</hi> who by the way, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, ſhould be able to bring their own Commodities as cheap as the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and ſo leave off building Ships, Trade, and Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This would be a ſurly dogged Humour indeed, exceeding any thing in ſtory, that a Nation ſhould make a Law that ſhould be ſo
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52493:63"/>
injurious to their own Trade, as that with one conſent they would ſet down and Starve; for ſo it muſt be, if we build not Ships ſince we cannot uſe Foreigners; it ſeems more reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to believe, let the Charge be what it will, Ships would be built the faſter. For that, in ſhort, then there would be no Trade, nor will the raiſing price of Ships or Freight be a loſs to Merchants or Owners, becauſe it will be charged on the Commodities, and that is paid by the Conſumers. But to make it yet more plain, that after all this pretence, there can be no prejudice either to the Merchant or Conſumer by employing our own Ships; We will examine further, what Trade requires our own built Ships and Seamen, and then how much our Ships will be the dearer, by buying Naval Proviſions from the <hi>Danes</hi> or <hi>Sweeds,</hi> or by fetching them in our Ships, than if we bought them from the <hi>Dutch;</hi> for it is they that are pretended to bring Materials cheapeſt.</p>
               <p>For the firſt part of the Enquiry, What Trade requires our own Ships and Men?</p>
               <p>There remains then nothing but ſome part of the <hi>European</hi> Trade, and greateſt part of that before the Act of Navigation was man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ag'd by our own Ships; and all that Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Ships were employ'd in, was the <hi>Northern</hi> Trade; the conſequence of which was, the <hi>Dutch</hi> by degrees taking it all out of our hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:52493:64"/>
The ſecond Inquiry is, How much our Building will be dearer by the <hi>Sweeds</hi> and <hi>Danes,</hi> and our own fetching of Materials?</p>
               <p>I cannot find either by my own Experience, (and I have traded conſiderably in all three) or any others, That the <hi>Dutch</hi> could bring Timber, &amp;c. cheaper than the <hi>Danes</hi> or <hi>Sweeds,</hi> and all the difference I could ever find be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt our Ships and theirs, was not above 5 <hi>s.</hi> in a Tun, tho we loaded <hi>Engliſh</hi>-built Ships; and how that affects our Building, is eaſily computed, when in building a Ship of 200 Tun, all that is needful to import for her Building and Rigging, will be little more than 50 Tun Stowidge; for it is to be noted, we uſe moſt of our own Timber and Plank for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part of the Ship, but her Decks and finiſhing within board, with ſome other ſlight Ornamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal part of the Ship; but this difference in the Carriage is ſo inconſiderable, that it will not ſerve for a diſpute. I ſhall therefore allow the difference of Freight to be 10 <hi>s. per</hi> Tun, which no man that is converſant in that Trade will ſay; and the <hi>Quantum</hi> to be double, that is, 100 Tun, which would make the difference 50 <hi>l.</hi> in Building a Ship, that fitted to Sea might coſt 2000 <hi>l.</hi> This being a large Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for them that bring in the Objection, yet makes the difference ſo ſmall, that it is of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle conſideration among Private Men, and will be of leſs to the Publick, eſpecially where our own Ships are employed; and it is alſo to be remembred, that we make not
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52493:64"/>
Building of a Ship as a Manufactory for Sale, but for our own uſe; and whether it would be more Profit for the Nation to Buy Ships, though they could be had 30 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Cheaper than we could Build for, I leave to Judgment: I know the common Topick, Cheapneſs of Carriage will be brought, as often it is, where it is foreign to the thing controverted, as it is here; <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships being Cheaper Built then ours, can afford Cheaper Freight than we; and ſo we loſe the profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of Trade, as Carriage no doubt is: This at firſt ſight looks formidable, as if it would ſtand its ground; but enquiring into the matter, we ſhall find nothing in it; I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewed that to more than three parts of the world, our Ships are allowed, more deſirable than any Foreign Ships, eſpecially than ſuch as are ſlight and cheaper Built; ſo then there is three parts in four that we ſtand at leaſt on the level with other Ships.</p>
               <p>That which remains is part of the <hi>European</hi> and Home-Trade; let us ſee how we could get a ſhare of that Carriage, if we had as Cheap Sea-Waggens as our Neighbours; for no better are moſt of the Ships us'd in the Lumber-Trade. For that part relating to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Importation into their Country and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, none will pretend unto; and for that of the <hi>Northern</hi> Crowns, I mean their Importati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the <hi>Dutch</hi> will have the Advantage, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til we can perſwade them to two things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:52493:65"/>
Firſt, That they will Eat no Bread, and then follow our example, place ſuch Duties on all Goods Imported into <hi>Holland,</hi> that there may be no poſſibility of Shipping them out again; until theſe two particulars happen, we roul a ſtone up hill, to imagine we can upon equal terms deal with them in the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> Trade; for that they can ſend Ships loaden with Commodities of all Countries, where we muſt ſend them light; and they can bring back Corn in Barter, and returns for what they carry there; but we have ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom need of Corn in this <hi>Northern</hi> Trade; we can then at moſt aim at no more than Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigating our own expence in it; ſo here is no Freight for us.</p>
               <p>We then come to the <hi>French</hi> Trade; and they are wiſer than to let any Carry for them, but from them you may; they wiſely laid 5 <hi>s. per</hi> Tun upon Foreign Ships, but none upon their own, as we have done: All this being matter of Fact, I cannot find if we had Ships as cheap as Eggſhells, where we ſhould Employ one more on Freight to Foreigners than we do, and they are very few to the <hi>Southward,</hi> and in the <hi>Levant,</hi> in neither of which Cheap Sailing is in demand, but Ships of Strength and Force; and for that reaſon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have been in moſt eſteem there.</p>
               <p>I think there needs no more to anſwer the Objection, that the Act of Navigation hinders the Building of Ships, or that we want ſlight Ships, ſince we have little uſe for them, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52493:65"/>
none at all if they any ways interfere with the Act of Navigation.</p>
               <p>We now come to the laſt exception againſt the Act: That by it we have totally loſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Trades; for that by the Act none but <hi>Engliſh</hi>-built Ships can Import the Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of any Foreign Country, or the Ships and Men of that Country, and perhaps they have none; and we Trading not there at all, the Trade is loſt. This had I only heard in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and not ſeen in Print, I ſhould not have mentioned it, left it might have been thought a Wiſp of Straw of my own lighting; but I place it as I find it; for I leave nothing out of all I could ever hear Objected againſt the Act, and therefore bring in this, though, I think, there needs no Anſwer more than to ſay, There are no Ships to bring away the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a Country, and we ſend none to fetch them; it is a ſtrange Indication that we have no uſe of their Commodities, or our Ships are better employed, and that we want Ships and Men for ſuch poor Trades, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will force us to increaſe, but the Act of Navigation; it being a certain Maxim in Trade and Navigation, <hi>That whilſt there is room in the eaſie and moſt profitable Part, none will run into the poor and more Laborious.</hi> And we not having Seamen enough to manage our profitable and eaſie Navigation, as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, is one reaſon of the decay of our rougher and poor Navigation; which was wiſely provided for in this Act, <hi>That all Foreign</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:52493:66"/>
                  <hi>Import, of Fiſh, Oyl, Whale, Finn, &amp;c. ſhould pay double Allience Duty.</hi> This was intended to give us advantage above Foreigners; and would, no doubt, be a good encouragement, if we had our other Trades ſupplied, to bring Seamen into the Fiſhing Trade; but having loſt the Trades for want of Ships and Seamen, that therefore we ſhould ſit down with the loſs, and take no courſe to retrieve it, becauſe at firſt we cannot bring in theſe Commodities as Cheap as Foreigners can, is with the Sloathful to ſay, <hi>A Lyon is in the way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we had, when this Act was made, better Reſolutions, and knew then, and ſo may now, That it is better for the Kingdom to Pay twenty Shillings to their own Men, than Fifteen to Strangers; and by doing that for a time, we may regain thoſe Trades, and manage them on as good terms as any other.</p>
               <p>This I believe will be thought ſufficient cauſe for the ſupporting the Act, as it was for making it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall add no more, but ſet down in few words the Tenor and Force of the Act of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, and leave every man to his own Judgment of it.</p>
               <p>The Act in the Preamble tells us, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for Increaſe of our Ships and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>That for Encouragement to ſo good a Work, that after a time limited, no Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built Ship, or men, ſhall Import any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52493:66"/>
but of the Product of their own Country.</p>
               <p>The Conſequence of which is, That no other Nation ſhould have the benefit of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to us, but each Country their own; and if they could not do it ſo Cheap as we, then our Ships would have the Carriage, and not Foreigners; by which our Ships and Seamen would be Increaſed.</p>
               <p>The other part of the Act is for encouraging our Fiſhing, and that is by placing double Allience-duty upon all Fiſh, Oyl, &amp;c. Caught and Imported by Foreigners.</p>
               <p>This ſure cannot be a fault, to give our own Men encouragement above Strangers; ſince the Navigation and Trade of the Kingdom gives them better Livelihood than the Fiſhing would; if Foreigners, who live hardly, might import Fiſh as free from Duty as they, the conſequence of which would be, that we ſhould loſe the Fiſhing, as we have ſome other Employments of our Seamen.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>Of</hi> Banks <hi>and</hi> Lumbers.</head>
               <p>PReſuming the uſefulneſs of Banks in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is not now controverted, I ſubmit to better Judgments how Banks and Lumbers may be ſet up in all Parts of this Kingdom for the Encouragement of the Manufactories and Navigation thereof. I conceive there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo deſtructive to the Trade and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52493:67"/>
of the Nation, as engroſſing the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Buſineſs of the Kingdom in great and few hands; that would bring the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom into the Rickets, draw all the Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Head, <hi>London</hi> would ſwell beyond its natural growth, and the other parts of the Kingdom waſte and dwindle to nothing.</p>
               <p>The Banks then that I ſhould humbly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, may be thus eſtabliſhed;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in every Shire there be a Bank erected by Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Fund for theſe Banks be Land and Money: And becauſe there may be no difficulty in point of Title of ſuch Lands as ſhall be put in Bank, that a Law may paſs in Parliament, That whoever is in quiet Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an Eſtate, and ſhall place it in the Bank as part of the Original Fund, that Land ſhall be perpetually in the Bank, whatever Title may afterwards appear; and ſhall only be transferr'd to him that ſhall recover the ſame: For it is to be underſtood, that whoever puts Land in Bank, is never to receive more out than his proportionable part of the Gain ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the General Stock: So that Land remains the ſame, whoever makes a Title to it.</p>
               <p>But for the better Credit of Land in the Bank, a Proviſo may be in the Act, That no Title of Land put into the Bank ſhall be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd after years: This will give a Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to any particular perſon's Title of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:52493:67"/>
Lands in the Bank, if he ſhould have occaſion to ſell his Intereſt, which otherwiſe will not be of equal Value with thoſe that put their Original Fund into the Bank in Money.</p>
               <p>The Fund of Banks being thus eſtabliſhed by Land and Money in each County, the next thing will be to appoint the <hi>Quantum,</hi> and who ſhall come in; for it is not to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but there will be more than enough, and every Shire will ſtrive to bring in as much as they will be permitted.</p>
               <p>For the General Fund of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, I ſuppoſe Four Millions may be ſufficient to begin with, half Land, and half Money; and for the particular Proportions of each Shire, their Proportion in the Land-Tax may be a good Rule. The Manage of theſe Banks in each Shire may be by men choſen among themſelves.</p>
               <p>That twice a year a General Meeting may be in <hi>London,</hi> two being ſent out of every Shire, there to ſettle Accounts, and make Dividends of the Profit; which would be great ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to all perſons concerned, and would quicken the Trade and Buſineſs of the Nation.</p>
               <p>For the diſpoſe, putting out, and receiving Money in Bank, there can be no ſet Rules, and therefore will depend upon the Accidents of War and Trade; but ſome ſtanding Rules may be thought on for the Rates of Exchange through the Kingdom; upon which there will ariſe great part of the Gain, and will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in the Advantage and Eaſe of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52493:68"/>
in quick circulating of the Money, and the moſt effectual way for ſuppreſſing High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-men, for that no man need travel with more than Pocket-Money for his Expence, when he may have Bank-Tickets to any part of the Kingdom where he goes.</p>
               <p>There ſeems a difficulty, Whether theſe Banks ſhould pay any Intereſt-Money, having ſo great a Fund, with which, and their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, they may ſupply all the Wants and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of the Nation, for that it will be impoſſible to hinder theſe Banks from having an Unlimited Credit; ſo that perchance Two Millions of Ready Money may anſwer Ten Millions in the Currant Payment of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for that few will take Money out, but transfer from one account to another.</p>
               <p>And it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that moſt men will lodge their Money in Bank, for the greatneſs of Security, and ſaving the trouble and hazard of telling Money.</p>
               <p>For theſe Reaſons it may be thought a Bank will pay no Intereſt; and that may be inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the Nation in two reſpects: Firſt, It may neceſſitate many people to carry their Money out of the Kingdom, where they may make ſome Benefit by it, when they are debarr'd from any Advantage at home. The other miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief it may do, reaches Widows and Orphans, whoſe Support often depends upon the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of their Money; and if Banks pay none, they will be able to ſet out at very low Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, more than the wants of the Kingdom will require.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:52493:68"/>
But that which I conceive may be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient in this caſe, may be a Proviſo in the Act of Parliament, That theſe Banks ſhall ſet out no Money at Intereſt upon Real Eſtates; by which means there will be room for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons to ſet out Money upon Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages.</p>
               <p>Theſe Banks being National, may be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted as to retrieve that moſt conſiderable part of the Navigation of the <hi>Greenland</hi> and <hi>New-found-land</hi> Fiſhing: But becauſe that may be diſcouraging to ſome perſons that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not Trade, and only depend on their Money at Intereſt, it will be neceſſary to ſhew, That notwithſtanding the Trade pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, there ſhall be a certain Fund or Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend of at leaſt Five <hi>per cent. per Ann.</hi> beſides the Profit of Trade, and that may be done thus; Suppoſing the Fund of Land to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued at 20 years Purchaſe, the Rent will be Five <hi>per Cent.</hi> for Two Millions; then for the other Two Millions in Caſh, allowing but Five <hi>per Cent.</hi> more for the Gain of Exchange, that compleats the Five <hi>per Cent.</hi> upon the whole Fund. This is a Certainty, without reckoning any Advantage to be made by the Credit of the Bank, and putting out Money to Intereſt.</p>
               <p>There will not be here room to mention the <hi>Modus</hi> or Advantages that will attend that moſt important Undertaking of the <hi>New-found-land</hi> Fiſhing: I ſhall only ſay, it would employ all the looſe and unprofitable hands in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52493:69"/>
it would add Ten thouſand Seamen to the Strength of it; it would bring a Treaſure into the Nation taken out of the Sea; it would occaſion the Conſumption of great Quantities of Manufactories; it would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Price, and conſume great Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Proviſions of this Kingdom; for that <hi>New-found-land</hi> is no place for either Tillage or Cattel, and we ſhall employ many Foreign Hands in that Trade.</p>
               <p>The Advantages that will ariſe to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by theſe Banks, need no explanation, for that they are eaſy to every Underſtanding; among the reſt, that of ſupplying the King with Money upon any Publick Funds, as ſhall be appointed by Parliament, is not the leaſt.</p>
               <p>Lumbers for poor Artizans and others, is an Appendix to Banks, and may by Funds out of them in each County be ſupplied ſo, as that the Poor may have Money to carry on their Trades and Employments on Pawns, that may be ſo eaſy, and with the advantage of ſelling in Publick Sales what they leave in Pledge, and that what they borrow ſhall be of more advantage and eaſe to them than if the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney were lent them <hi>gratis;</hi> and may be of great uſe in the improvement and enlarging the Manufactories of the Nation, which are much diſcouraged by the neceſſities and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips that are put on the poor for want of Sales, which theſe Lumbers will ſupply, and the beſt and readieſt means for the poor to ſell their Goods every Month; whereas now they are
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:52493:69"/>
often forced to ſell their Labour to Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers at ſuch rates, as gives them little more than what their Materials coſt them; which hath the worſe effect, in that it encourages a ſet of Idle men in the Kingdom, with folded Arms in a Shop, to live upon the Ruins of Handicrafts-men; their Numbers are increaſed even to a Nuſance, by their eaſy way of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on the Oppreſſion of the Poor.</p>
               <p>If we took Preſidents from abroad, this evil would not have grown thus amongſt us. It is obſerved, That there is not ſo many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailers in <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> as there is in ſome Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-Towns in <hi>England;</hi> and this evil is the more to be condemn'd, ſince we want not a Statute to prevent it; for in the 5<hi>th.</hi> year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> a Statute paſs'd, That Artizans Sons ſhould not be Apprentices to Shopkeepers: There was then none turn'd from Mechanical Arts to be Retailers, as now there are Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that do, and greateſt part <hi>Quakers,</hi> a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that for many reaſons may be thought as unprofitable to the Nation as <hi>Jews;</hi> and ſo I take the greateſt part of Retailers and Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers to be; they ought as much to be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and kept to a <hi>Quantum,</hi> as Hackney-Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Coffee-Houſes; for tho both, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to Numbers, are uſeful, yet in their exceſs are Nurſeries of Idleneſs, and ſuch as I am of opinion would have been provided againſt by our Anceſtors, had they ſprung up in their days: But on this Subject, among other Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, I have writ at large in another Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52493:70"/>
which when the diſpoſition of the Times will admit, may come forth.</p>

               <p>BEfore I enter upon the Subject, I muſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologize for my ſelf, that I am to the laſt degree ignorant of the Practick part of Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry; the whole Courſe of my Life having been ſpent in Maritine-Towns, or on the Sea.</p>
               <p>I beg pardon, contrary to Cuſtom, before I commit the Error, giving an inſtance of my ignorance in Country Matters; which I ſhould not trouble the <hi>Reader</hi> with, if I did not think it divertive.</p>
               <p>It was in the 32 year of my Age, that I firſt had a thought of Acres; and being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portun'd by Friends to fix ſomething on the Land, and not have all on the Sea, I made a Purchaſe before I ſaw it, for that I might do with as much Judgment, as if had; ſome time after I went to ſee the Purchaſe I had made, and on the Road gave as much Diverſion to my Friends, in declaring my want of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the Diſtinction and Names of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing the Field produced, as I did trouble to them to inform me; tho it was near Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, I knew not Barly from Wheat in the Ear; and when I came to the Eſtate, and riding thorow the Woods (of which there
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52493:70"/>
were great Quantities on the Land); I was yet more troubleſome in asking the Names of Trees, not being able to diſtinguiſh an <hi>Oak</hi> from an <hi>Aſh,</hi> or that from <hi>Wich-Hazel,</hi> which made a merry Fellow, a Ranger in the Woods, ſay, <hi>He had a Maſter he was ſure would not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion his Care or Honeſty, ſince he knew not a Tree from a Weed.</hi> After this Account of my ſelf, I hope to be excuſed, if I miſtake in any Point of Country and Land-Improvement; nor ſhall I attempt to preſcribe Rules, or give my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in theſe matters, as I may venture to do in that of Trade; and therefore as Rural Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have relation to that, ſo I ſhall here treat of the <hi>Plow,</hi> and of the <hi>Pruning-Hook;</hi> the <hi>Field,</hi> and the <hi>Orchard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How Land may be improved, there cannot be a truer or greater Preſident, than that of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> a ſpot of Ground not ſo large, as one third part of <hi>England,</hi> yet main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained double the People <hi>England</hi> doth. That the Fertility of the Soil did not make the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in their great increaſe above ours, is obſerved by ſuch as Travel there; that at this time under the manage of the Lazy <hi>Turk,</hi> that Land is much worſe, and brings forth leſs increaſe than ours. So then it is apparent, Labour and Induſtry makes the difference. Now, if the foregoing Computation be right, that there were near double the People in that little Spot than there are in <hi>England,</hi> (as there is reaſon to believe) for that in <hi>David</hi>'s Reign the Number of Fighting-men was 1510000,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52493:71"/>
beſides the Two Tribes not brought into the Account; this being allowed, it will follow, that there is not one Sixth part made of the Land of <hi>England,</hi> as might be: But to this, might be ſaid, the want of Hands is the cauſe of our ſcant Production; and that nothing but Crouds forceth Labour; this is true as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, but not ſo as to be without a Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: Nmbers of People make Laws for Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry out of neceſſity, and good Laws may do the ſame with this Advantage, that enlarging the Labour in <hi>Rural</hi> Affairs, will produce more than is conſumed in the Nation; and that adds to the Treaſure of it: Whereas Numbers of Hands that only work to feed themſelves, adds nothing to the Riches of the Kingdom. Now as Riches increaſe, ſo will the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Men (which is indeed the beſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure); we ſee this in the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> where all Nations flock as Fowl where they find beſt feeding; Money is ſo to Men, and where that abounds, Labour and Induſtry is encouraged; but to ſit down with an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that <hi>England</hi> cannot be improved for want of People, is too mean and abject for <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhmen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a viſible Proſpect how great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements may be made in this Kingdom by the Hands we have; and if that were done, we ſhould ſoon have more.</p>
               <p>There are thouſands of Perſons in this Kingdom that beg, who might be ſerviceable in many things relating to the Plow; if lame
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52493:71"/>
in their Feet, yet they may weed Corn, that perchance now takes up the time of a luſty Man.</p>
               <p>A Blind man may carry Burthens in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with other; a Man without Hands may look to Cattle, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>There are numbers of Men of no Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we have Laws that might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige to Work, and if they are not full e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to reach them, they may be made to do it.</p>
               <p>There is alſo another Set of Men that are loſt in the Nation under the Cover of being Serving-men and Footmen. Now this might be reſtrained, and Men confined to the Numbers they keep according to their Quality, which if done, might add to the Plow, and other Country Employments, many thouſands in this Nation.</p>
               <p>I differ with them, who complain of our Gentries humour of taking <hi>French Valets de Chambres.</hi> I wiſh there were a Law that none but ſuch ſhould be taken into ſuch Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or at leaſt that no Gentleman ſhould have above one <hi>Engliſhman</hi> in his Family in Service, as a Waiter or Foot-man; this would drive Young men into the Country to Labour, when they had no expectation of a Lazy Life and Maintenance, as now they have.</p>
               <p>Tho this is a General Complaint thorow the Kingdom, of the want of Men for the Plow, and that the Wages of a Plow-man is
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52493:72"/>
riſen from 5 to 10 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> no man will ſay, it is becauſe there are not Men in the Kingdom, but it is becauſe there are eaſier ways to get a Living; tho at the ſame time, if thoſe that chuſe that idle Life of waiting on Gentlemen, did but conſider their hazard of begging their Bread in their Old Age, or ſooner, if Sickneſs, or any other Accident be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal them: Whereas there are few inſtances of Labouring-men in the Country that come to ſuch misfortunes; many from the Plow or Orchard, arrive to a decent Living and Competency, but few from holding a Plate.</p>
               <p>I have often lamented the ſight of Four or five luſty young Fellows hanging at the Tail of a Coach, when they are wanted at the Plow; and ſince it is not practicable to get Plow-men from <hi>France,</hi> but is to get Foot-men and <hi>Valets de Chambres,</hi> to me it would ſeem a good Law to prohibit <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> from ſuch Employments, and that would bring in <hi>French</hi> and other Foreigners enough to ſupply their places.</p>
               <p>Thus I have laid down my thoughts of adding hands to our Country Employments, which may be improved by better Judgments. All I ſhall further ſay, is, That to me it ſeems plain, that there might be 40000 Perſons added to thoſe we now have in Country Employments, and they would ſo advance, and enlarge <hi>Rural</hi> Production, as would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52493:72"/>
Numbers, both at home and from abroad, into the Country, which hath been for ſome Ages ſo much neglected; the humor of this Nation running too much after the <hi>French,</hi> I mean thoſe of them that come abroad; for their Peaſantry never do; thoſe we have from them are Artizans or Lacquies, and ſuch too many of our Nation affect to be, and ſo quit their Country Employments; I mean not by this, any diſcouragement to Manufactories, they cannot exceed; but ſome have too many that attend them, eſpecially ſuch as are conſumed in the Kingdom, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth the Vanity of the Nation, whilſt the moſt ſolid Improvements and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it are neglected for want of hands; and if what is here propoſed may produce and bring Numbers into Country Labours, the next enquiry will be, how to Employ them, ſo as to make Plowing and Land-Improvements as much a Trade and Manufactory as other Manual Arts; for that which hath always diſcouraged Tillage in this Kingdom, hath been the practice of making Proviſion for no more than the Expence of the Nation; whereas if ſuch quantities of Grain was Sowed as might make it a Commodity for Exports, that would ſoon invite Merchants to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation.</p>
               <p>The Statute which was made for encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of Tillage, was for that part of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:52493:73"/>
at the Cuſtom-Houſe of good uſe; but ſomething more muſt be done to make Corn a Commodity for Exportation, and that muſt be to have quantities yearly Sowed beyond the Expence of the Nation, that ſo Merchants may be ſure of a conſtant Trade, as they have in the <hi>Sound;</hi> where the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try depend as much on their Harveſt, as <hi>France</hi> doth on its Vintage; and Merchants being ſure of a conſtant ſupply, make Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the Trade; whereas ours is only a chance Market, when the Harveſt proves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond expectation, and often failing, puts us upon Importing Corn from other parts: This in a Country ſo natural for Grain, and that lies ſo near <hi>Holland,</hi> which fetcheth ſuch quantities from abroad, may be thought not the leaſt of our miſtakes in Trade and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce: To me, I confeſs, it ſeems a great neglect, to ſee ſo many Acres ſet for Five or Ten Shillings an Acre, and the Tenants ſcarce able to pay that, which under Corn might yeild to the Farmer Five Pounds; and though part of that goes in Labour, yet the whole is ſo much added to the Treaſure of the Nation; and would be the greateſt advantage to the Rent of Lands that ever was, or can be by any other means raiſed in the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Now that what I here propoſe may appear practicable, ſomething ſhall be offer'd that, I conceive may ſhew what I here ſet down to be more than meerly Notional.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:52493:73"/>
1. Firſt then as to the Grain, which is moſt in demand in Foreign Markets, and they are Rye for <hi>Holland,</hi> Horſe-Beans for <hi>Bilboa,</hi> and Barly for <hi>Portugal;</hi> I mention not Wheat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that we have moſt of, but the other three is leaſt propagated in <hi>England,</hi> though the moſt proper for Exportation, and ſeems poſſible, conſidering how much nearer we lye to a Market than <hi>Dantzick,</hi> to be exported from <hi>England</hi> as Cheap as from any Part; and as Quantities in other Commodities enables the Seller of them to abate in Price of what they can when they are ſcarce; ſo it would be in this of Corn; when a Farmer is more ſure of a Market for Twenty Acres of Corn, than he is now of Five; he may abate of his Price, and yet be a greater Gainer than when he hath but a little, and a greater Price; we account it ſo in all other Commodities.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For Encouragement of making Corn an Export, it is to be remembred, That we ſend moſt of our Ships light to <hi>Bilboa</hi> and <hi>Lisbon;</hi> ſo that will help our Navigation that loads our Ships; then it is to be conſidered, that our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> do not anſwer our Imports from thence, ſince we fetch ſo much Wine from <hi>Portugal;</hi> and it is hoped ſince we have fallen into it, we ſhall never exceed in <hi>French</hi> Wine: They neither can, nor will take off our Commodities; Corn they never did, as <hi>Portugal</hi> will.</p>
               <p>The difficulty that appears to the introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of this ſo profitable a diſpoſition of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:52493:74"/>
Lands of <hi>England,</hi> is how to bring the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it; for all new things are hardly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated.</p>
               <p>Three things I ſubmit, that to me ſeem of ſtrength to bring the Nation into it: And they are theſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That a Statute be made to oblige all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to a certain Proportion of Plowing, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what they keep in Grazing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That all Land under Tillage ſhall be free from any manner of Tax.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That ſome eaſe may be given as to the Tythe for what is Exported; it is a heavy load and diſcouragement, one tenth for that which goes out; care ſhould be taken to make what goes out as Cheap as poſſible, that ſo no other Country might Underſel us; I would not be thought to leſſen the Income of the Clergy; to the contrary, I think, they ought to partake of all the Increaſe of the Kingdom; and what I here propoſe, would be for their advantage, by encouraging the greater Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports; and ways might be found to give ſome encouragement from them to the Plow-man, that might be eaſy to both. But to all that hath been ſaid for encouragement of Tillage, there appears a ſeeming Objection, and that is, We often ſee Corn ſo Cheap, that the Farmers are broke by it, and what would they do with double the Quantities, as it is hoped this Law and Encouragement might produce? This is partly anſwered before,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:52493:74"/>
That the reaſon why we want a Market for our Corn, is becauſe we have not always Store, and ſo Merchants make no Proviſion for the Trade, nor will quit a place where they are ſure of Supply; ſo if once it were known that <hi>England</hi> ſet upon the Trade of Corn, there would not be want of Buyers; it is not to be imagined how ſoon the Plenty of a Commodity makes a Trade; I remember when we imported quantities of Silk Stockins from the <hi>Levant,</hi> but as ſoon as we had the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Looms, the ſtream turned, and we ſend them there. Plenty makes Cheapneſs, and that increaſeth Trade.</p>
               <p>But there is another Anſwer to be given for the want of a Market for our Corn, and that is, We run moſt on Wheat, and neglect thoſe ſorts before-mentioned, which are moſt in demand abroad, and of which we could never exceed, but the more we provide, the greater will the Price be; for Quantities, as is before ſaid, brings numbers of Buyers; whereas where there are not Stores of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, Buyers are but few, and then they ſet the Market, and have the Commodity at their own Rate.</p>
               <p>I ſhall end this Firſt Part of my Eſſays as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan them, Truth may be allowed repetition; That as this Nation never more wanted Thoughts and Endeavours to enlarge and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their Navigation and Commerce than now (having ſo Potent a Neighbour as the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:52493:75"/>
                  <hi>French</hi> that grow upon us) ſo, Bleſſed be God, <hi>England</hi> never had a greater Monarch that lays out himſelf to make us a great and flouriſhing People: If we are wanting to our ſelves, it is our fault, and will be our misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; Meaſures for Trade muſt ariſe from the Subject, Grants and Conceſſions from the King.</p>
