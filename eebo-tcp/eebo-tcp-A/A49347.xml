         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>SIR, as I in a Melancholly Mood,</l>
            <l>Upon the Bank of our Fam'd River, ſtood,</l>
            <l>Seeing the Wherries paſſing too and fro,</l>
            <l>And marking how the Tides did Ebb and Flow;</l>
            <l>How flowing high, the Waters waſh't the Wall</l>
            <l>Of our Dread Sovereigns Royal Court, <hi>White-Hall</hi>:</l>
            <l>How, when they Ebb'd and left the Kingly Houſe,</l>
            <l>They naked left the <hi>Strand,</hi> the Mud and Ouſe;</l>
            <l>What pains men took who Row'd againſt the Tide,</l>
            <l>How eaſily the Boats did with it glide.</l>
            <l>Methought I ſaw within this Wat'ry Glaſs,</l>
            <l>The Image of our Times oft-Changing Face,</l>
            <l>Which did my Melancholy Thoughts relieve,</l>
            <l>And that Times Tide would turn, ſome Hopes did give.</l>
            <l>My Lord, The World and I do ſee it now,</l>
            <l>The ſwelling Tide begins to turn with You;</l>
            <l>The God who flowing Waters doth Command,</l>
            <l>Sets them a Period, and then bids them Stand,</l>
            <l>Doth with his Power the Tydes of Malice bound,</l>
            <l>Leſt men with Waters or with Rage be Drown'd.</l>
            <l>Your Foes, whoſe Rage but now ſwell'd to the Brink,</l>
            <l>With Shame return, diſcovering as they ſink,</l>
            <l>The Filthy Bottom and the Stinking Mud</l>
            <l>That lay unſeen under the Rolling Flood.</l>

            <l>For Int'reſt Law and Goſpel will abuſe;</l>

            <l>When Malice would ſome Obſtacle remove!</l>
            <l>They care not if their Inſtruments be Damn'd,</l>
            <l>The King, and all the World beſides, be Shamm'd,</l>
            <l>When their Deſign to bring about they hope,</l>
            <l>A Popiſh Succeſſor, with him a Pope,</l>
            <l>For you my Lord they'd laid a deſperate Snare,</l>

            <l>VVith Cunning Arts of a Soul-Damning Sin,</l>
            <l>They thought they for your Life had laid their Gin,</l>
            <l>Their Trap's Diſcover'd, and themſelves fall in.</l>
            <l>Fools not to know, there can be no Defence</l>
            <l>Againſt a Righteous God and Innocence.</l>
            <l>But Sir, they aim'd not at your Life alone,</l>
            <l>More muſt have fallen when that you were gone,</l>
            <l>They'd firſt remove the Nations Prop and Stay,</l>
            <l>Then take Religion and our Laws away;</l>
            <l>Bring in the Pope and Arbitrary Sway.</l>
            <l>But God look't down and ſaw the deep Deſign.</l>
            <l>And by Good Angels broke their Snares like twine:</l>
            <l>A Jury which upon Record ſhall ſtand,</l>
            <l>As worthy Patriots who had ſav'd their Land;</l>
