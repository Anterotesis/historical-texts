         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Neither muſt we idolatrouſly magnifie the

of all Idolatry, and ſpirituall fornication,
ſaith thus; <hi>A Father</hi> afflicted with untimely

a God, which was then a dead man, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to thoſe that were under him, ceremonies and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:23455:9"/>
Sacrifices. Thus we ſee, out of the heat of a too
ardent and earneſt love, tranſported in a prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous
current, that is ſoone taken from the
Creator, and given to the creature; and where
that true-loving affection of man is placed, there
is way made for Idolatry, if not rightly and
ſtrongly guided by the Spirit of Grace and thus
we may offend even in things that are moſt
deare, moſt neare unto us, in our wives, children,
ſelfe love &amp;c. as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 29. <hi>Eli</hi> honoured his
children more than God. Ambition in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
of our firſt Parents, in a ſelfe love to

<hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 5. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5. Mammon is the Idoll,
and the worldling the Prieſt that ſacrificeth to

to their captived <hi>Mars:</hi> And upon this he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowes
a double worſhip; an inward, for hee
loves, deſires, delights, and truſts in his wealth:
and an outward, for he ſpends moſt of his time
upon his Idoll, in gathering carefully, keeping

and yet the duſt of earthly profits hath

men, the worſt of reaſonable creatures; and then
even to Devils the enemies of God and man, they
gave that incommunicable name of God; Thus
by little and little, the Devill brought on the

men and their Religion as uncertaine, as <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball's</hi>

which have beene ſo long forſaken: as alſo it is

they might be provoked to emulation, God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
their fall and rejection not ſimply, but
for the end which is good; elſe it were againſt

to the greater, If their fall be riches to the world,
much more ſhall their reconciliation be life
from the dead:</p>
            <p>

able to reſtore them againe, as a man to awake

and give ſight to the blind, which are miraculous

more to reſtore them, which is but a replanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>So that fiftly, according to likelyhood, If <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
