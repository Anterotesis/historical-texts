            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Testimony that <hi>Sarah Beck,</hi> the Wife of <hi>John Beck,</hi> did bear and signifie of the Love of God, which she was sensible of when she was very Weak of Body, and on her DYING-BED.</head>
            <p>SHE continued seven Weeks and one Day after the Birth of her Daughter <hi>Sarah;</hi> and all the time of her Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness she was very patient, and freely given up and resign'd to the Will of God, often signifying, <hi>She was Content, whether to Live or Dye;</hi> saying, <hi>She had sweet Peace with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And on the <hi>First day</hi> at Night, being the 3d of the 6th Moneth, she was worse than before; and in the Morning she grew very ill and weak, so that it was thought, that she had been gone; and when she recovered, she said, <hi>She was Well; I was very well if I had gone:</hi> But after that she was raised by the mighty Power of God many times to praise and magnifie the Name of the Lord, saying; <hi>Oh, thou pure God! Oh, thou pure God! O thou blessed God! O my Saviour! Honoured be thy Name, Praised be thy Name, Renowned be thy Name.</hi> And when she had rested a little, being very weak, she desired of the Lord, that she might praise his Name again, before she departed out of this Tabernacle; and the Lord by his Living Power did raise her up in a wonderful manner, contrary to the Expectation of them that were with her; and his Living Presence did surround her, insomuch that she could not contain, but brake forth into a sweet Harmony, and fung Praises unto the Lord, even to the rendring and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Hearts of several, and true refreshing of the Souls of the sensible Ones, that were with her, who had true Unity with her; yea, she was so overcome with the Love of God, and the Joy of that Endless Life, (into which she is now entered) that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48175:3"/>
she cryed forth aloud, <hi>Magnifie the Lord! O Magnifie the Lord! O Magnified be thy Name! O thou God of my Life! Glory to thy Name, thou Helper of</hi> Israel; and said, <hi>O Friends! Praise the Lord; O Praise him, every one of you! for surely Heaven is open; I see God in his Glory, O! he shines: Friends, do you not see how God shines. O God! thou shinest in thy Beauty of Holiness! O what a Light is here! sure Heaven is open: I see God on his Glorious Throne, and his holy Angels:</hi> And she sweetly praised the Lord, and said, <hi>O Lord! thou hast satisfied my Soul: I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, that I might Praise thee, and thou hast satisfied me; Honour, Glory and Halelujahs unto thee: O thou God of my Life! Oh! I feel sweet Peace and great Joy, Oh! the Joy that is laid up for the Righteous; Oh! who would not but fear the Lord! who would not but be faithful!</hi> And she was taken ill again, and was very Sick, so that it was thought several times, that she had been gone, but the Lord again did raise her up; and she would have said aloud, <hi>O Lord! O God! let me Praise thy holy Name once more before I depart out of this Tabernacle:</hi> And the Lord did answer her earnest Desire, and by his Eternal Power gave her Ability to Praise, Magnifie and Glorifie his Holy Name, as before, to the refreshing and comforting of Friends that were with her, and some that were no Friends in the Truth, said, <hi>Surely God was with her:</hi> And she did often signifie what great Joy and Peace she felt, saying, <hi>Surely never greater Joy can be desired, than what I now feel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And at another time she said, <hi>My Physician is come; O God! thou art my Physician, and thou hast Cured me: I matter not for all the Physicians in the World; for I believed in thee, and thou hast Healed me:</hi> And she said, <hi>My Soul is near ready to be offered up unto the Lord as a Living Sacrifice:</hi> And took her leave of her Husband, and the rest of her Friends, taking them by the hand, and kissed them, and bid them Farewel one by one; saying with a chearful Countenance, <hi>I am near going;</hi> she said, <hi>This sweet End will come; it makes my heart glad when I remember my end; It will be the Happiest Hour that ever came to me:</hi> She remembred her Love to Friends, and said, <hi>I desire that Friends may be faithful.</hi> And when it was thought that she was in great Pain and very Sick, so that some said, <hi>It was very hard:</hi> she answered, <hi>Nay, it is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48175:3"/>
very easie; for the Lord sweetens it; Oh! thou Glorious God, thou hast satisfied my Soul; I am filled with thy pure Presence: O thou Keeper of</hi> Israel! <hi>Praised and Magnified be thy holy Name forever, for thou art Worthy, and thy Mercies and Goodness are End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less: O Righteous God! O who would not but Praise thee! O that I may Praise thee while I have Breath and Being!</hi> as indeed she did; for even at the hour of her Departure she praised the Lord very sweetly; and said, <hi>Call in the Family;</hi> they being called in, <hi>Now,</hi> said she, <hi>Rejoyce Friends;</hi> and reached forth her hand to her Husband, and holding him by the hand, made sweet Melody in her Heart, to the Praise and Honour of the Lord, and to the great Comfort of Friends that were with her; and said, <hi>Dear God</hi> (several times together, (being very Weak) <hi>what shall I render unto thee for this Evening Sacrifice?</hi> And so went on in Prayer and Praising the Lord, till her natural Strength failed; and then turned her face to the Pillow, and lay still like an innocent Lamb, as indeed she was, and said no more, even as if she had fallen a sleep, being the 13th of the 6th Moneth, 1679. in the Evening.</p>
            <p>Many other sweet and comfortable Words she spake, which cannot be remembred to the full; but as she lived an innocent Life, so was her Latter end comfortable, and she hath laid down her Head in Perfect Peace with the Lord her Maker and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer</p>
            <p>Well, the Lord shall have the Praise, the Honour and the Glory, over all, and not any Creature, for he is worthy, as she hath often said both in her Health, and also in her Sickness; for she would alwayes lay the Creature Low, and God to have the Glory of his own Work, who is worthy, blessed over all forever.</p>
            <p>And in the time of her Weakness several came to see her that were not Friends, before whom she was moved to bear a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Testimony against their Hireling Priests; and in the Name of the Lord, and in his Living Power, did she testifie, That they were out of the Right Way, and not sent of God, and therefore did not profit the People at all: And she cleared her self; that it was not in the least in Emnity or Ill-will that she had towards the Priests, but that the Lord had made her a living Witness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48175:4"/>
their Wayes and Covetous Practices; to which some of them answered, <hi>That they did believe her, for they believed that she wished all well.</hi>

            <head>Concerning <hi>Sarah Beck,</hi> my dear wife, this Testimony I have to bear.</head>
            <p>THat she was a Woman truly fearing God, and had a true and real Desire after Truth and Righteousness, and after the Welfare &amp; Prosperity of it both in her self, &amp; all that professed it; &amp; that those that knew it not might come to the Knowledge and Obedience of it: And after I came into acquaintance with her, and did move her to Marriage, Oh! how Solid and Weighty she was! insomuch, that she would often say, <hi>Marriage is a weighty Thing;</hi> and did often desire and breathe to the Lord, That we might proceed in it in the true Fear of the Lord, and then our Love and Unity would abound one towards the other, and so it did: And after we were married, her whole desire and breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was, that we might both be kept in the true Fear of the Lord in all our Undertakings, and in a living Sence of the Truth, and of the Goodness of the Lord towards us; and this Desire being True and Real it was encreased, so that she grew in the Gift or Measure that God had committed to her; and being faithful and obedient, so that she came to have her Mouth opened to pray to God in our Family, whereby I was often refreshed and broken into Tenderness, through the living operation of the Power and Gift of God in her, which did freshly &amp; livingly spring
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48175:4"/>
in her many a time; so that a living Testimony and a good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance remains upon my Heart continually concerning her: And often she said, <hi>O! that we may be kept faithful to the End, that we may never Offend the Lord;</hi> so that her Desires, Breathings and Groanings were after the Lord Night and Day, that she might not lose her Peace with him, and this was also granted unto her; for in the time of her Sickness and outward Exercise, she was patient and contented, though her Exercise was many times very sharp, yet she did patiently bear it; and said many times, <hi>It will be over;</hi> and that <hi>she had true Peace with God;</hi> and her Heart was full many times with Praises unto God, that he had kept her in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Peace with him; and being kept in this Condition, she was a Refreshment to Friends when they came to visit her. And when she drew near her time of the giving up of her Natuarl Life, she bid, <hi>Call in the Family;</hi> and she took me by the hand, and then took her leave of us one by one, bidding us <hi>Farewel;</hi> and then she prayed while one could understand what she said, then she laid down her Head upon her Pillow, as though she would have fallen asleep, and so she gave up her Natural Life without either Sigh or Groan, like an Innocent Lamb: and she is gone to her Rest with her Maker and Husband, who had betrothed her unto himself in Faithfulness.</p>

Methinks I wish that all People would truly fear the Lord.</hi> So far was she from bearing any Ill-will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any, that she wished the Everlasting Well-fare of All, and it was her earnest desire unto the Lord, that he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve her faithful unto himself, and that she might live to his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48175:5"/>
Praise while she lived; and as the Lord had put it into her Heart to seek true Peace with him, so (blessed be his Name) he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served her in the same to the end of her dayes.</p>
            <p>For on her dying Bed she did often signifie, that she was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent whether to live or dye, saying, That <hi>she had sweet Peace with God;</hi> and she said, <hi>It makes my Heart glad when I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber my End, it will be the Happiest Hour that ever came to me.</hi> Yea, she did often signifie what great Joy and Peace she felt, singing Praises unto the Lord, and making sweet Melody in her Heart, saying, <hi>Oh thou Ocean, Ocean! Oh Fulness, Fulness! Oh! who would not but fear the Lord, and serve him all their dayes! Oh the Joy, that is laid up for the Righteous!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in all the time of her weakness of Body, she was very patient and freely given up to submit to the Will of God, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>O Lord, I will wait upon thee with patience, till my Change come; for surely thou art worthy to be waited upon! Oh thou God of my Life! Oh that I may Praise thee while I have Breath and Being!</hi> Yea, that was her earnest desire, both for her self and others, both in her Health and Sickness) as indeed I (with several more) was a Witness that she had her desire granted; for even at the Hour of her departure she Praised the Lord very sweetly; and the last Words that she uttered, were in Prayer unto the Lord, and in praising of his Holy Name; and so passed away quietly as if she had fallen asleep.</p>
            <p>And now although I with many more, unto whom the Lord made her Serviceable, am sensible of a great want of her; yet of this I do conclude, that though it be our Present Loss, it is her Everlasting Gain. So unto the Lord do I desire to commit my Cause, who is able to supply all our Wants, and to make hard Things easie, as we truly eye him, and have our whole Dependance upon him, who is God over all, blessed forever.</p>
            <p>Now what I have here written concerning my dear Sister, the Lord knows my Heart, it is notin the least to set her up above her place, as if she had been able to do any thing of her self, but as the Lord did enable her, as she often confessed unto the Lord, <hi>That of her self she was not able to do anything, but all her Help and Ability was in the Lord alone.</hi> So unto him be the Praise over
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48175:6"/>
all, and not unto any Creature, for there is none that can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any acceptable Service unto the Lord, but as he enables them; therefore unto him be the Honour and Praise of his own Work forever.</p>

            <p>THat I travelled with her in her Exercise, both in her Health and in her Sickness; and her Desire was, That all might be Faithful to what was made manifest unto them; and in the time of her Weakness of Body, I can truly say, That I was sensible of her Exercise, and did bear a share with her, and said several times to her, That <hi>I did believe that the Lord would turn it to her Joy, whether it was to live or dye;</hi> and when the Time came, that the Lord comforted her, I can truly say, I was comforted with her; and so I can truly say, that I had such Unity with her, that that which was her Joy was my Joy, and that which was her Sorrow was my Sorrow: So I can bear witness what is above-written, for I was much conversant with her in the time of her Weakness.</p>

            <p>PEACE is sown for the Righteous, and Joy and Gladness for the Upright in Heart; they are certainly Blessed and truly Happy who answer the holy Call of God by pure Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as this our beloved Sister hath done; for she chose the Truth to be her Path, and her Delight was in it even from a Child; and as she grew in Years, so she grew in the Truth, and by Faith therein was a true Witness of God's heavenly Word of Power manifested in her Bosom, by the Virtue of which her Soul was made alive by Christ, who is the Light, the Life, &amp; the Power, by which she came to be reconciled to God again, and so became a true Witness of his Name and Saving Health, and therein did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol his Praise and magnifie his Power, as she hath often sweetly

So being satisfied and perswaded, that many Friends are of the same Faith and Belief concerning her, I rest with this Testimony in my Heart, which is here expressed.</p>

            <p>THat she was an Innocent Woman, and from her Childhood, till her Dying-day, she alwayes minded good things; for when she was a Child, she had an Eye to God, that she did not offend him, and loved good Friends well; and as she grew up in Years, so she grew in the Truth of God, alwayes desiring the Prosperity thereof; so that her Diligence exceeded many of her Equals in Years, and the Lord was with her, and she grew in the Truth, and he put his Word in her Mouth, and she faithfully declared it, as the Lord required her, whether as in a Publick Testimony amongst Friends, or otherwise to warn People to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and Turn unto the Lord, to whom he did send her, and she was faithful in all things as the Lord gave her Utterance; for she was but a weak Instrument, but as the Lord was her Strength, unto whom she would alwayes return Praise; for he alone was Worthy; for it was the Glory of God that was most in her Mind, and she was wholly given up to serve him in all his Requirings, and his pure Fear was truly placed in her Heart, so that when the Lord did visit her Body with Weakness, and as she grew Weaker outwardly, so was her Strength renewed <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

aloud (when she was very weak of Body, so that she was ready to faint away, as to outward appearance) and Praised and Magnified the Name of the Lord (as is testified in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Testimonies) and often exhorted Friends to Faithfulness: I was often with her in the time of her Sickness, and I was well refreshed with her; for when her Sickness did but a little abate then she would be Praying and Praising the Name of the Lord, often signifying to us, what Joy and Peace she did feel, to the Satisfaction of her Immortal Soul, and to the great Comfort of us her Friends, who had sweet Unity with her; and although it was a great Exercise to us, her near Relations, to part with her, being a living Instrument in the hand of God, by which we were well refreshed many a time; yet we can certainly say to the Joy of our Hearts, That it is her Everlasting Gain, and she hath laid down her Head in Perfect Peace; for I can truly say, That I am often well refreshed and comforted in the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of her, my dear Sister.
