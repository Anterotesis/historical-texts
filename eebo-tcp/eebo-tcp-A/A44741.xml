            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Had this been the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, or that the principle of thoſe with whom I have to do in this Treatiſe, for the leading on and rectifying of thoſe Acts which they have done, in order, or rather in diſorder to the Church. I ſhould not have needed to have troubled them or thee with ſo many doubts or Quaeries as are here preſented to thy view, but their over-haſty reſolutions have brought forth theſe queſtions. Had they ſincerely and impartially examined their deſignes before hand, wee had beene ſaved the labour of this after examination of their performance; ſome may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps count me with the Proverb, That a fool may ask more que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions than many a wiſe man can anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; others may charge me with over-much arrogancy and boldneſſe, To take upon me the examination of the acts of a whole Synod, conſiſting of ſo many learned Divines; others may blot me and this book with the imputation of impertinency in ſeeming to require anſwers of them for thoſe things which are the Iſſues of another wombe, the ſharpe effects of the influence of another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation. And perhaps there will not be ſome wanting that will challenge me of leſſe clearneſſe, and of as little ingenuity in my proceeding in that I have not ſet up the particular markes that I have ſhot at, before every ſhaft that I have let go, that is to ſay, That I have not ſet downe the particular paſſages of the Directory againſt every Quaere which is paſſed upon them. And indeed it is but reaſon, that I who am ſo forward to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſatisfaction of others, ſhould not be backward in giving
<pb facs="tcp:58627:3"/>
ſatisfaction to others that may require it of me: mine anſwer therefore to them that ſhall examine me, or that ſhall make any of the aforeſaid objections againſt me, is this:</p>
            <p>To the firſt, That it is too true, That it is very eaſie for wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to be pozed and puzzled by folly. The many unneceſſary, fruitleſſe, unſober and pernitious queſtions of this age, that is ſicke of an inquiſition, do too plainly and evidently convince it. But yet though curioſity hath the ſtamp both of malevolency and folly upon it, yet it may be remembred, that as wiſe men are bound in reaſon to cleare and juſtifie thoſe acts which they do of publique concernment: ſo it may bee the part of honeſt and ſober men to deſire it of them, eſpecially where many conſciences are engaged upon the inqueſt, and that under the penalty of an eternall mulct, and where the Authority whereby things are done is within a little as doubtfull, as the reaſon of their doing being done.</p>
            <p>It may well be I confeſſe, that that Painter ſpoiled his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture that mended it, or rather altered it according to the excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of every fancy that would finde fault with it; an errour that ſome are too guilty of in theſe dayes, in the too eaſie change of frames and draughts of a farre greater moment than the painters workemanſhip, and an eye endued but with natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and ordinary skill may eaſily perceive what a comely defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is left us. If the people muſt alwayes bee heard in ſuch matters, I meane in matters of Church and State government; they will never likely have done their quarrels, untill they have quarrelled or agitated all into confuſion; ſince as Judicious Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> hath well obſerved, and we finde by lamentable experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at this day: There is ſcarce any thing more eaſie than to perſwade a people that they are not well governed; no yoke can be ſo fit or eaſie to their necks, but thoſe untamed Calves or Bullocks will be ready enough to ſhake it off, and plead for licentiouſnes under the name of liberty; hence it is that affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of novelty is ſuch an epidemical diſeaſe amongſt them, and not more univerſall than turbulent and pernicious; which made the Thurian's lawgiver provide that ſevere Antidot againſt it, by making a law that whoever would go about either to aboliſh any one of the old lawes, or attempt to eſtabliſh a new, ſhould preſent himſelfe before the people with a rope about
<pb facs="tcp:58627:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his neck: to the end, that if his invention were not approved of all men he ſhould preſently be ſtrangled, and ſo hee ſhould taſt firſt of the poyſon that himſelfe had mingled: That it might not be ſafe for any man to propoſe that which ſhould be dangerous to the whole body. A law that never was more needfull than to our people, and in theſe dayes; and I thinke we may well wiſh it had been the firſt Act of this preſent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; it might no doubt have ſaved a great many lives, and prevented a multitude of miſchiefes. <hi>A great Moraliſt maketh it a great doubt,</hi> whether any ſo evident profit may <hi>be found in the change of a received Law of what nature whatſoever, as there is hurt in the removing of the ſame, for ſo much, as a well ſetled policy may be compared to a frame or building of divers parts joyned together with ſuch a ligament as it is impoſſible to ſtirre or diſplace one, but the whole body muſt needs be ſhaken or ſhew a feeling in it.</hi> The doubt I conceive to be a little too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but yet the reaſon that hee giveth hath proved too true in our preſent condition. And the old ruſty ſword of juſtice at <hi>Marſeille,</hi> that the ſame Authour tells us of, was a good em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blmee to ſignifie, the great caution that ſhould bee uſed in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of novelty in publique adminiſtrations.</p>
            <p>But yet though the danger of novelty doth forbid the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be admitted for tamperers with the ſetled conſtitutions of a Kingdome, ſince the ſelfiſh nature of men is ſuch, that for the moſt part every one (as we ſee) would have his private af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and deſignes be the onely gages of publique rules, and the profit of one man is obſerved to be the dammage of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet when the perillous buſineſſe of changing old or making new Lawes is ſet on foot, it is not inexpedient that all mens objections may be heard againſt them before they be throughly eſtabliſhed; and therefore it were not a miſle that as ſome Colleges uſe to deale in the admiſſion of their members, making them probationers for a certaine time before they be finally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the number; ſo thoſe new Lawes that are brought in might be probationers too amongſt us for a convenient time, in which time it might be free for all men to make their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions againſt them in a faire and peaceable manner. The banes of them ſhould be firſt as it were publiquely asked as we

            <p>But this may ſerve I hope to excuſe me from the over-ſevere cenſure either of folly or malignity, in that now I have indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured ſo far to ſerve the good of the Church &amp; State; as now in this time of attempted change, and whileſt thoſe new Lawes that are brought in are yet upon their probation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being not yet eſtabliſhed by a full authority (which cannot be done with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion of, or contradiction of the ſupreme magiſtrate) yea, whileſt the Lawes are yet in force whereby the old cuſtomes are ordained (unleſſe we will admit that the acts of a leſſe and more imperfect power may aboliſh the acts of that which is more full and perfect, or that a Body without a Head hath more faculty and perfection than a Body and Head together) I hope I ſay I may be excuſed from the aforeſaid cenſures, if now I have diſcharged ſo much faithfulneſſe to the Church and State, and particularly to my Prince and the ſuffering party, as to offer my objections againſt thoſe things that are attempted in a faire way to the publique view, and eſpecially unto their conſideration who have taken upon them the mannage of the buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>And this may ſerve in part too, for an anſwer unto the ſecond objection that may be made againſt me in point of Arrogancy, in undertaking the examination of the Acts of a whole Synod. I ſhall acknowledge the parts and gifts that are amongſt them to be farre more eminent than any I can pretend unto I contend not with them in theſe things, but I hope to be found as faithfull as they, and thinke I have altogether as much Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to deſire a reſolution from them of thoſe doubts that conſcience may make againſt, that they have done, as they hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> (being not deſigned by the ſupreme power, or the Church
<pb facs="tcp:58627:4"/>
thereunto) to make conſtitutions wherein mens Conſcience are not ſatisfied. God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the World to confound the wiſe, the weaker things of the World to confound the things that are mighty, the baſe things of the World and things that are deſpiſed hath God choſen, yea, and things which are not to bring to nought things that are; that fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence. I deſire not to make odious compariſons for them, nor ambitious or arrogant ones for my ſelfe, not to quench but revive the flames of Chriſtian love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us. But yet it is poſſible they may be in an errour; and then <hi>Micaiah</hi> was no preſumptuous Prophet to oppoſe 400 Prophets that had miſtaken their meſſage; and I could tell my cenſurers that the <hi>Arrian</hi> Councells, and the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> too might have had a more free and uninterrupted paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through the World perhaps, if they had been ſecured from the examination and oppoſition from particular men. And we know the Apoſtle hath laid a command upon us to try the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; however we may reverence their guifts, and wiſh the Church the benefit of them in the right employment; yet wee dare not aſcribe ſo much Divinity unto them, as to take all things upon truſt that they ſhall impoſe upon us, or receive eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Mettall of their Coinage for pure Gold, without bringing it unto the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eſt, leſt in ſo exalting them wee ſhould debaſe the moſt high; and whileſt we afford ſuch reverence unto them, we ſhould forget to pay that reverence which is due from us, unto the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and thoſe Conſtitutions which have beene eſtabliſhed by other former Synods at leaſt as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall as they.</p>
            <p>If all this will not juſtifie me form a blot of inſolency, I muſt beare it for ought I know, onely to make them the more inclinable to lenity in their cenſure of it: give me leave to ſay, that if I cannot bee freed from the guilt of inſolency, in taking upon me to examine the Acts of a whole Synod (as they are ſtiled) I cannot ſee how it will gaine them the Glory of modeſty to take upon them not onely to examine but to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh the Acts of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> confirmed by the Lawes of the ſupreme civill power, and by the Conſtitutions of the Eccleſiaſticall State of this Nation, unleſſe they had a better calling to do it than we know of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:58627:5"/>To the third quarrell of impertinency that may be entred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt me in deſiring an anſwer from them for the actions of others. I anſwer briefely, That the higheſt capacity that I can look upon them in, in that Body where they are aſſembled, is as they are choſen by thoſe others for the direction of their Conſciences, in thoſe things which they were to doe. And therefore if things have beene done amiſſe, it concerned them to have adviſed them better, and yet wee have ſome reaſon to beleeve, where we conſider the advantages that divers of the Synod have made unto themſelves of ſome of thoſe Acts that have beene done by others, in the receiving the benefit of plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities of Sequeſtred Livings, &amp;c. That ſome of thoſe things were done not for want of their advice to the contrary, but were promoted by their advice and councell. And Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours as well as Actours of Inconveniences are anſwerable to God, and may be deſired by men concerned, to afford them ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in Conſcience: However it bee I doe but propoſe Quaeres and Doubts of them in the maine, and if there be any modeſt harmeleſſe way I thinke that is it.</p>
            <p>To the fourth and laſt objection that I am lyable to. I doe not undertake the juſtification of my ſelfe againſt it, but firſt excuſe it, and deſire pardon; my minde is full of many thoughts in theſe times, many iſſues I have ſtrugling in the wombe of my ſoule at once, and one hath the hand as it were upon the heele of another, like <hi>Jacob</hi> upon the heele of his Brother, ready to ſupplant it, or precipitate the birth of it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the particular buſineſſe of the Directory reaſons was not in my minde when I went firſt about this worke, and that may I hope bee admitted for one tolerable Apology for the omiſſion of ſetting downe the Paſſages of the Directory in the ſame order with the Quaeres, unto which divers of them are directed.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, to make ſome amends for this errour, I have here afforded thee the draught of the preface to the Directory, where thou haſt the ſeverall objections thereof againſt the Common Prayer, which are pointed at, and called to a reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſome of the Quaeres, eſpecially in the 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, &amp;c. unto the 26. Together with ſome other particular

paſſages of the Directory it ſelfe concerning Buriall of the Dead, and Holy-dayes which are touched upon therein.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall deſire farther to know why I have not gone through with other paſſages of the Directory; I anſwer with the proverb, that haſt makes waſt, and withall ſome regard was to bee had of the volume in ſuch a time, when people are ſo eaſily frighted from a Booke by the Bulke of it. But if I finde that the further proſecution thereof ſhall bee deſired from ſo weake and rude a hand as mine is. I ſhall be willing to make up what hath beene wanting ere it be long: In the meane time honeſt Reader, <hi>His mere mecum,</hi> read deliberately and judge impartially, and the Lord who is the God of wiſedome and Peace fill thee full of the riches of his ſpirituall wiſedome, and reſtore Peace unto us in theſe poore diſtracted Kingdomes.

            <head>The Preface TO THE DIRECTORY.</head>
            <p>IN the beginning of the bleſſed Reformation, our wiſe and pious Anceſtors tooke care to ſet forth an Order for Redreſse of many things, which they, then, by the Word diſcovered to bee Vaine, Erroneous, Superſtitious and Idolatrous, in the Publique Worſhip of God. This occaſioned many Godly and Learned men to rejoyce much in the Booke of Common-Prayer at that time ſet forth; Becauſe the Maſse, and the rest of the Latine-Service being removed, the Publique
<pb facs="tcp:58627:7"/>
Worſhip was celebrated in our owne Tongue; many of the common People alſo received benefit by hearing the Scriptures read in their owne Language, which formerly were unto them as a Booke that is ſealed.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, long and ſad Experience hath made it manifeſt, That the Leiturgie uſed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (notwithſtanding all the paines and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious intentions of the Compilers of it) hath proved an offence, not onely to many of the Godly at home; but alſo to the Reformed Churches abroad. For, not to ſpeake of urging the Reading of all the Prayers, which very greatly increaſed the burden of it; the many unprofitable and burdenſome Ceremonies, contained in it, have occaſioned much miſchiefe, as well by diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Conſciences of many godly Miniſters and people who could not yield unto them, as by depriving them of the Ordinances of God, which they might not enjoy without conforming or Subſcribing to thoſe Ceremonies. Sundry good Chriſtians have beene by meanes thereof, kept from the Lords Table, and divers able and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſters debarred from the exerciſe of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery (to the endangering of many thouſand Soules, in a time of ſuch ſcarcity of faithfull Paſtors) and ſpoiled of their livelyhood, to the undoing of them and their Families. Prelates and their Faction have laboured to raiſe the Estimation of it to ſuch an height, as if there were no other Worſhip, or way of Worſhip of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, but onely the Service-Booke; to the great hinderance of the Preaching of the Word, and (in ſome places, eſpecially of late) to the juſtling of it out, as
<pb facs="tcp:58627:7"/>
unneceſsary; or (at best) as farre inferiour to the Reading of Common Prayer, which was made no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than an Idol by many Ignorant and Superſtitious People, who pleaſing themſelves in their preſence at that Service, and their Lip-labour in bearing a part in it, have thereby hardened themſelves in their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and careleſſeneſſe of ſaving Knowledge and true Piety.</p>
            <p>In the meane time Papiſts boasted, that the Booke was a compliance with them in a great part of their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and ſo were not a little confirmed in their Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and Idolatry, expecting rather our returne to them, than endeavouring the Reformation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: In which expectation they were of late very much incouraged, when, upon the pretended warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of impoſing of the former Ceremonies, new ones were daily obtruded upon the Church.</p>
            <p>Adde hereunto (which was not foreſeene, but ſince hath come to paſſe) that the Leiturgie hath been a great meanes, as on the one hand to make increaſe an idle and unedifying Miniſtery, which contented it ſelfe with ſet Formes made to their hands by others, without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth themſelves to exerciſe the gift of Prayer, with which our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> pleaſeth to furniſh all his Servants whom hee cals to that office: ſo on the other ſide it hath beene (and ever would be, if continued) a matter of endleſſe ſtrife and contention in the Church, and a ſnare both to many godly and faithfull Ministers, who have beene perſecuted and ſilenced upon that occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to others of hopefull parts, many of which have
<pb facs="tcp:58627:8"/>
been, and more ſtill would be, diverted from al thoughts of the Miniſtery to other ſtudies; eſpecially in theſe latter times, wherein God vouchſafeth to his people more and better meanes for the diſcovery of Errour and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, and for attaining of knowledge in the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of godlineſſe, and gifts in Preaching and Prayer.</p>
            <p>Vpon theſe, and many the like weighty conſiderations, in reference to the whole Booke in generall, and becauſe of divers particulars contained in it; not from any love to Novelty, or intention to diſparage our first Reformers (of whom wee are perſwaded that were they now alive, they would joyne with us in this worke, and whom wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge as Excellent Inſtruments raiſed by God to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the purging and building of his Houſe, and deſire they may be had of us and Poſterity in everlaſting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, with thankfulneſſe and honour;) but that we may in ſome meaſure anſwer the gracious Providence of God, which at this time calleth upon us for further Reformation, and may ſatisfie our owne Conſciences, and anſwer the expectation of other Reformed Churches, and the deſires of many of the godly among our ſelves, and with all give ſome publique Teſtimony of our indeavours for Vniformity in Divine Worſhip, which we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in our Solemne League and Covenant: We have after earneſt and frequent calling upon the Name of God, and after much Conſultation, not with fleſh and bloud, but with his holy Word, reſolved to lay aſide the former Leiturgie, with the many Rites and Ceremonies former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed in the Worſhip of God: And have agreed upon this following Directory for all the parts of Publique
<pb facs="tcp:58627:8"/>
Worſhip, at ordinary and extraordinary Times.</p>
            <p>Wherein our care hath beene to hold forth ſuch things as are of Divine Inſtitution in every Ordinance; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things we have indeavoured to ſet forth according to the Rules of Chriſtian Prudence, agreeable to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Rules of the Word of God. Our meaning therein being onely that the generall heads, the ſenſe and ſcope of the Prayers and other parts of Publique Worſhip being knowne to all, there may be a conſent of all the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, in thoſe things that containe the ſubſtance of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Worſhip of God; And the Miniſters may bee hereby directed in their Adminiſtrations to keepe like ſoundneſse in Doctrine and Prayer; and may, if need be, have ſome helpe and furniture; And yet ſo, as they become not hereby ſlothfull and negligent in stirring up the gifts of Christ in them: But, that each one, by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, by taking heed to himſelfe and the flock of God committed to him, and by wiſe obſerving the wayes of Divine Providence, may be carefull to furniſh his heart and tongue with further, or other materials of Prayer and Exhortation, as ſhall be needfull upon all occaſions.</p>
