            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

or mecanicall, ſhall receiue ſauourable place in
the honourable opinion of nobilitie, by ſo much the
more ſhall the practiſer be eſteemed: which is the cauſe that at this time imboldneth
me, to preſent vnto your moſt honourable fauour this ſmal treatiſe of Nauigation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a breefe collection of ſuch practiſes as in my ſeuerall voyages I haue from experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
collected Among which in my three ſeuerall attempts for the diſcouery of the
Northweſt paſſage, thereby to finde a ſhorte and nauigable courſe vnto the riche and
famous Countries of <hi>Cathayo, China, Pegu,</hi> the Iſles of <hi>Molucan</hi> and <hi>Philli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina,</hi>
that thereby to the great and ineſtimable benefite of our Countrie, there might
be a rich and plentifull trade procured betweene vs and the ſaid nations in ſhort time
to be perfourmed, and with great ſafetie in regarde of the courſe: which action and
diſcouery (by meanes of that honourable Counſeller Sir <hi>Frauncis Walſingham</hi>
Knight, principall Secretary to her Maieſtie) was with good reſolution accepted by the
Merchants of London but in the decay of his honourable life, the attempt was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb facs="tcp:25298:3"/>
quailed: but howſoeuer mens mindes alter, yet vndoubtedly there is a paſſage
nauigable, and eaſie to be perfourmed by that courſe (whenſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe God
to reueale the ſame) by inuincible reaſons, and ſufficient experience to be proued: and
although before I entred into that diſcouery, I was ſufficiently perſwaded of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie
thereof, by hiſtoricall relation ſubſtantially confirmed, whereof to the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
I made ſufficient proofe, but eſpecially to my worſhipfull good freend Maſter
<hi>William Sanderſon,</hi> the onely Merchant, that to his great charges with moſt conſtant
trauaile did labour for the finiſhing thereof: yet I thanke God that of late it hath
beene my very good chaunce to receiue better aſſurance then euer before of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie
of that paſſage, and ſuch was my vehement deſire for the perfourmance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
that thereby I was onely induced to goe with M. <hi>Candiſhe</hi> in his ſecond attempt
for the South Seas, vpon his conſtant promiſe vnto me, that when we came to the
<hi>Callifornia,</hi> I ſhould there haue his Pinnice with my owne Barck (which for that
purpoſe went with me to my great charges) to ſearch that North weſt diſcouery vpon
thoſe backe partes of <hi>America,</hi> but God hath otherwiſe diſpoſed our purpoſes in his
deuine Iudgements, for M. <hi>Candiſhe</hi> being halfe way through the ſtraights of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilane,</hi>
and impatient of the tempeſtious furiouſnes of that place, hauing all his Ships
and company with him, returned for <hi>Braſill,</hi> by the authoritie of his commaund, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
with a leading winde we might haue paſſed the ſame, and returning more then 80.
leages toward <hi>Braſill,</hi> my ſelfe being in his Ship named the <hi>Deſire,</hi> without Boate,
Oares, Sayles, Cables, cordage, victuals, or health of my companye ſufficient for that
attempt, was ſeperated in a frette of weather, and forced to ſeeke the nex ſhorte for my
releefe, and recouering a harborow by vs named Port Deſire, being in the lati. of 48.
deg. did there repaire my moſt miſerable wantes, and there ſtaying foure moneths in
moſt lamentable diſtreſſe, did againe conclude with my company to giue an other at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to paſſe the ſtraights, as my beſt meane to gaine releefe. And three times I
was in the South Seas, but ſtill by furious weather forced back againe: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all this my labour to perfourme the voyage for his profite, and to ſaue my
ſelfe, (for I did aduenture and my good freends for my ſake 1100. pounds in the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.)
M. <hi>Candiſhe</hi> was content to account me to be the authour of his ouerthrowe,
and to write with his dying hand that I ranne from him, when as his owne Ship was
returned many moneths before me,</p>
                  <p>I am bolde to make this relation vnto your Lordſhip, onelye to ſatisfie your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

and now referring my cauſe to your Lordſhips conſideration, I will again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to my purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>In thoſe Northweſt voyages where Nauigation muſt be executed in moſt exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
ſorte, in thoſe attempts I was enforced to ſearch all poſſible meanes required in
<pb facs="tcp:25298:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſayling, by which occaſion I haue gathered together this breefe treatiſe, which with my
ſelfe I doe dedicate to your moſt honourable protection, being deſirous if it lay in my
power, to doe farre greater matter in your Lordſhips ſeruice, hoping of your honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
pardon, becauſe it is onely done to ſhew my dutifull affection, and not for any
ſingularitie that the worke containeth, For I thinke there be many hundreds in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
that can in a farre greater meaſure and more excellent methode expreſſe the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
arte of Nauigation, and I am fully perſwaded that our Countrie is not inferiour
to any for men of rare knowledge, ſinguler application, and exquiſite execution of the
Artes Mathematick, for what Strangers may be compared with M. <hi>Thomas Digges</hi>
Eſquire, our Countryman the great maſter of Archmaſtrie, and for Thericall ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and moſt cunning calculation M. <hi>Dee</hi> and M. <hi>Thomas Heriotts</hi> are hardly to
be matched: and for the mecanicall practiſes drawnefrom the Artes Mathematick,
our Countrie doth yeelde men of principall excellencie, as M. <hi>Emery Mulleneux</hi>
for the exquiſite making of Globus bodies, and M. <hi>Nicholas Hellyar</hi> for the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laritie
of portrature hath the praiſe of Europe, M. <hi>Baker</hi> for his skill and ſurpaſſing
grounded knowledge for the building of Ships aduantageable to all purpoſe, hath not
in any nation his equall.</p>
                  <p>And now that I may returne to the painefull Seaman, it is not vnknowne to all
nations of the earth, that the Engliſh goeth before all others in the practiſes of ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
as appeareth by the excellent diſcouery of Sir <hi>Franncis Drake,</hi> in his paſſage
through the ſtraights of Magilane, which being then ſo rawly knowne, he could not
haue paſſed, vnleſſe he had beene a man of great practiſe and rare reſolution: ſo much
I may boldely ſay, becauſe I haue ſeene and taſted the frowardnes of the place, with
the great vnlikelyhoode of any paſſage to be that way.</p>
                  <p>I might heere repeate the moſt valiant and excellent attemps of Sir <hi>Hugh Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lougbie,</hi>
Sir <hi>Iohn Hawkins,</hi> Sir <hi>Humfry Gilbert,</hi> and your Lordſhips ſeruant M.
<hi>George Raymond,</hi> with diuers others that haue giuen moſt reſolute attempts in the
practiſes of Nauigation, as well for the diſcouery as other execution, whereby good
proofe is made, that not onely in the skill of Nauigation, but alſo in the mecanicall
execution of the practiſes of ſayling, we are not to be matched by any nation of
the earth.</p>
                  <p>And ſith Nauigation is the meane whereby Countries are diſcouered, and comu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
drawne betweene nation and nation, the word of God publiſhed to the bleſſed
recouery of the forraine of caſtes from whome it hath pleaſed his deuine Maieſtie as
yet to detaine the brightnes of his glory: and that by nauigation common weales
through mutuall trade are not onely ſuſteined, but mightily enriched by whole hard
aduentures ſuch excellent benefites are atchieued, for by his exceeding great hazzards
the forme of the earth, the quantities of Countries, the diuerſitie of nations, and the
natures of Zones, Climats, countries and people, are apparantly made known vnto vs:
<pb facs="tcp:25298:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Beſides, the great benefites mutually interchanged betweene nations, of ſuch fruites,
commodities, and artificiall practiſes wherewith God hath bleſſed eche perticular
Countrie, coaſt, and nation, according to the nature and ſcituation of the place.</p>
                  <p>For what hath made the Spaniard to be ſo great a Monarch, the Commaunder of
both Indias, to abound in wealth and all natures benefites, but onely the painefull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie
of his Subiects by Nauigation: their former trade was onely figs, Orenges, and
Oyle, but now through Nauigation it is brought to be golde, ſiluer, pearles, ſilkes, and
ſpice, by long and painefull trade recouered. Which great benefites onely by her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties
louing clemencie and mercifull fauour he doth poſſeſſe: for if her highnes and
her moſt honourable Lords would but regarde the ſmall diſtance betweene her do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
and thoſe famous rich kingdomes, the eaſines of the paſſage being once diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered,
(the Northweſt I meane) with the full ſufficiencie of her highnes Subiects to
effect the ſame, there could then be no do doubt but her ſtately ſeate of London ſhould
be the ſtorehouſe of Europe, and a nurſſe to all nations, in yeelding all Indian commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
in a farre better condition, and at a more eaſie rate then now brought vnto vs,
exchanging commodities of our owne ſtore, with a plentifull returne at the firſte
hand, which now by many exchanges are brought vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>Then ſhould the Spaniard againe returne to his olde trade, and our ſacred Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
be ſeated the Commaunder of the earth: which trade and moſt fortunate
diſcouery, we aboue all nations ought moſt principally to regarde, becauſe of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularitie
and inviolable force of our Shipping, which is not onely the commaunding
fortreſſe of our Countrie, but alſo the dread of our aduerſary, and glory of our nation:
wherein we doe in no ſorte flatter our ſelues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it was made apparant to all nations
of the earth, by the late moſt famous conqueſt that her Maieſtie had againſt the
huge ſuppoſed inuincible fleete of the Spaniard, being by her Nauie vnder the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
of your Lordſhip who there in perſon and in place of her Maieſtie, to your
eternall glorious ſame did diſgrace their glory, and confound their force, and manifeſt
their weakenes by their daſtardly flight, through Gods prouidence and your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
ſtately reſolution.</p>
                  <p>Then ſith Nauigation is a matter of ſo great moment, I ſuppoſe that euery man is
bound in dutie to giue his beſt furtherance thereunto: among whome as the moſt
vnmeete of all, yet wiſhing all good to the painefull traueller, I haue publiſhed this
ſhorte treatiſe, naming it the <hi>Seamans Secrets,</hi> becauſe by certaine queſtions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
and anſwered, I haue not omitted any thing that appertaineth to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret

                     <p>IT hath been an ancient cuſtome among Mariners to deuide the Compaſſe

9. of the clocke, and a South Sunne 12. of the clocke: &amp;c. as in the figure
following ſhall plainely appeere. But this accompt is very abſurd, for with
vs in England (the Sunne hauing his greateſt North declination,) it is
ſomewhat paſt 7. of the clock, at an Eaſt Sunne, and at a Southeaſt Sunne
it is paſt 10. of the clocke: alſo when the Sunne is in the Equinoctiall, the
Sunne is halfe the day Eaſt, and halfe the day Weſt, to all thoſe that be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

of the Compaſſe, to perfourme the motion of 12. howers: therfore the diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of time may not well be giuen by the Compaſſe, vnleſſe the Sunne be
vpon the Meridian, or that you be farre toward the North, in ſuch places
where the Sunnes Horizontall motion is very oblique, for there the hower
may be giuen by the Compaſſe, without any great errour, but elſewhere it
cannot. Therefore thoſe that trauaile muſt either vſe the Globe, or an
Equinoctiall diall, by whom time may be moſt certainly meaſured, if there
bee good conſideration of the variation of the needle by which the Equinoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall

tides in the alteration of flowing and reflowing, is by long experience found
to be gouerned by the Moones motion, for in ſuch proportion of time as the

degrees nereſt, all which differences are cauſed by the excontricitie of her
Orbe wherein ſhe moueth, and are onely perfourmed in the Zodiac, but the
Sea men for their better eaſe in the knowledge of tides, haue applied this
the Moones motion, to the points, degrees, and minutes of the Compaſſe,
whereby they haue framed it to be an Horizontall motion, which ſith by long
practiſe is found to be a rule of ſuch certaintie, as that the errour therof brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
no danger to the expert Seaman, therefore it is not amiſſe to follow
their practiſed precepts therein.</p>
                     <p>In euery 29. daies 12. howers 44. minutes, one with another through the
yeere, the Sunne and Moone are in coniunction, and therefore that is the
quantitie of time betweene change and change, for although the Moone in
27. daies and 8 howers perfourming her naturall motion, doth returne to the
ſame minute of the Zodiac from whence ſhe departed, yet being ſo returned,
ſhe doth not finde the Sunne in that parte of the Ecliptick where ſhe lefte
him, for the Sunne in his naturall motion mouing euery day one degree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Eaſt, is moued ſo farre from the place where the Moone left him,
as that the Moone cannot ouertake the Sunne to come in coniunction with
him, vntill ſhe haue perfourmed the motion of 2. daies, 4. howers, and 44. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes

<pb facs="tcp:25298:8"/>
there are 29. daies, 12. howers, 44 minutes, betweene change &amp; change,
one with another through the whole yeere: but the Seaman accompteth the
Moones motion, to be vniforme in all places of the Zodiac alike limiting her
generall ſeperation from the Sunne, to be ſuch as is her ſloweſt naturall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is 12. degrees, or 48. minutes of time, in euery 24. howers.</p>
                     <p>By which accompt there are 30. daies reconed betweene change and

this difference breedeth but ſmal errour in their accompt of tides, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to alter practiſed rules where there is no vrgent cauſe, were a matter
friuolous, which conſidered, I thinke it not amiſſe that we proceede therein
by the ſame methode that commonly is exerciſed.</p>
                     <p>Allowing the Moone in euery 24. howers to departe from the Sunne 12
degrees, or 48. minutes of time, and in this ſeperation the Moone moueth
from the Sunne Eaſtwards, vntill ſhe be at the full, for betweene the change
and the full, it is called the Moones ſeperation from the Sunne: for after
the full ſhe doth apply towards the Sunne, ſo that betweene the full and the
change it is called the Moones application to the Sunne, in which time of
application ſhe is to the Weſtward of the Sunne, as in her ſeperation ſhe is
to the Eaſtward, or I may ſay in the Seamans phraise, all the time of her
application ſhe is before the Sunne, and in the time of her ſeperation ſhe is
abaft the Sunne.</p>
                     <p>Then if the Moone doe moue 48. minutes of time in 24. howers, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
that ſhe doth moue 24. minutes in 12. howers, and in 6. howers ſhe
moueth 12. minutes, therefore euery hower ſhe moueth 2. minutes, and ſuch
as is the difference of her motion, ſuch is the alteration of tides, and therfore
euery tide differeth from the other 12. minutes, becauſe there is 6. howers
betweene tide and tide, and in euery hower the courſe of flowing or reflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
altereth 2. minutes, whereby it appeereth that in 24. howers the foure
tides of flowing and reflowing doe differ 48. minutes of time.</p>
                     <p>And ſith the whole knowledge of this difference or alteration of tides, as

there finding the Sun, he muſt conſider what is the hower allowed to that

of the diſtance betweene the Zenith and the Horizon.</p>
                     <p>Every degree applied to meaſure, doth containe 60. minutes, and every
minute 60. ſeconds, and every ſecond 60. thirds, &amp;c, and every degree of a

barly cornes drye and round, after our Engliſh accompt, which for the uſe of

                     <p>ALtitude is the diſtance, height, or mounting of one thing aboue another,
ſo that the altitude of the pole, is the diſtance, height, or mounting of the
pole from the horizon, and is defined to be that portion of the meridian, which
<pb facs="tcp:25298:13"/>
is contained betweene the Pole and the Horiſon, which altitude or eleuation
is to be found either by the Sunne, or by the fixed Starres, with the helpe of
pour Croſſe ſtaffe, Duadrant, or Aſtrolabie, but the croſſe is the onely
beſt inſtrument for the Sea mans vſe.</p>
                     <p>And in the obſervation of this altitude there are 5. things eſpecially to be
regarded: the firſt is, that you know the meridionall diſtance between your
Zenith and the Sunne of Starresa, which by your Croſſe ſtaffe or Aſtrolabye
is giuen: the ſecond, that the declinaiton be truely knowne at the time of
pour obſervation. And the other three are, that you conſider whether your
Zenith be beweene the Equinoctiall and the ſunne or Starres, or whether
the Equinoctiall be betweene your Zenith and them, or whether they be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
your Zenith and the Equator, for there is a ſeverall order of working
vpon eche of theſe three differences.</p>
                     <p>Latitude you muſt alſo know, that ſo much as the Pole is aboue the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon,
ſo much is the Zenith from the Equinoctial, and this diſtance between
the Zenith and the Equator is called latitude or widenes. and is that portion
of the Meridian which is included betweene your Zenith and the Equator, for
it is generall rule for ever, that ſo much as the Pole is aboue the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon,
ſo much the Zenith is from the vpon Equinoctiall, ſo that in this ſence alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and latitude is all one thing, the one hauing relation to that parte of the
Meridian contained betweene the pole and the Horizon, and the other to that
parte of the Meridian which is contained betweene the Zenith and the
Equinoctiall.</p>
                     <p>You muſt further vnderſtand, that betweene the Zenith the Horizon it is
a quarter of a great circle, containing 90. degrees, ſo that knowing how
much the ſunne or any Starre is from the Horizon, if you take that diſtance
from 90. the remainer is the diſtance betweene the ſaid body and the Zenith:
as for example, if the Sunne be 40, degrees 37. minutes from the Horizon,
I ſub<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

which is the diſtance betweene my Zenith and the Sunne, &amp;c. Thoſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that begin the accompt of their degrees at the Zenith concluding 90.
in the Horizon, are of moſt caſe for the finding of the latitude by the Sunne
or fixed Starres, becauſe they giue the diſtance betweene the Zenith and the

muſt haue, and for which you do ſearch in your obſeruation: all which things

6. of the clocke in the afternoone, and that is the meridionall declination
which I muſt vſe, being 90. deg. Weſt from London, which to doe, the laſt
example doth ſufficiently teach you, whereby you may eaſily gather the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

you reade with the eye of reaſon, and labour to vnderſtand with iudgement

                     <p>There is another way moſt excellent for the finding of the Suns decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

bring the thnd that is faſtened to the Center of the inſtrument, 7. degrees
from the Equinoctiall towards the North, becauſe the Sun hath ſo much
North declination, and the thrid doth ſhew me vpon the verticall circle, that
the ſunne is 38. degrees from my Zenith.</p>

2. Q. The pole artick being 50 deg. aboue the Horizon, and the Suns di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
30. deg. from the Zenith, I demaund what is the Suns declination?</p>
                     <p>2. A. As in the firſt queſtion I place the North pole 50. degrees aboue

Degrees from my Zenith, and then the thrid ſhe weth vpon the Meridian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the tropick of Cancer and the Equinoctiall, that the Sunne hath
20 degrees of North declination.</p>
                     <p>3. Q. The Sunne hauing 10. deg. of South declination, being vpon the
Meridian, is 53. deg. from my Zenith, I demaund what is the poles height:</p>
                     <p>3. A. In the firſt queſtion the Poles height and the Sunnes declination
are giuen, fore finding of the Sunnes meridionall diſtance from the Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith.
In the ſecond the Poles height is giuen, and the Sunnes meridionall
diſtance from the Zenith, therby to finde the Sunnes declination. And in this
queſtion the Sunnes declination and meridionall diſtance is giuen, for the
finding of the Poles height. I therefore bring the thrid faſtned in the center
of the inſtrument 10. degrees South from the Equator, between the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall
and the tropick of Capricorne, there holding the third not to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
I then turne the Horizon vntill I bring the 53, degree of the verticall
circle vnder the third, and then the Horizon ſhe weth me, that the North pole
is 43. degrees aboue the ſame.</p>
                     <p>4. Q. The Sunhauing 12. degrees of ſouth declination, and being vpon
the Meridian South from me, is 30. degrees aboue the Horizon, I demaund
how farre the Sun is from my zenith, how much the Equinoctiall is aboue
the Horizon, and what is the Poles height?</p>
                     <p>4. A. Firſt I bring the third to the place of the Sunnes declination as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
there holding it not to be moued, then I turn the Horizon vntill I bring
it to be 30 deg. vnder the thrid, and then the third ſheweth me that the Sun is
60. deg. from my zenith, and the Horizon ſhe weth that the Equinoctiall is 42
deg. aboue the ſame, and that the North pole is alſo eleuated 48. deg. aboue
the horizon. Although theſe queſtions are ſo very eaſie and plain, as that they
may readily be anſwered by memory, yet becauſe the reaſons how they are
anſwered may the better appeare, is the cauſe wherefore they are demaunded
and in this ſort anſwered, only for the benefit of ſuch as are not altogether ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert

                     <head>What is the Sea Chart?</head>
                     <p>THe Sea Chart is a ſpeciall inſtrument for the Seamans vſe, whereby
the hidrographicall deſcription of the Occean Seas, with the anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
geopraphicall limits of the earth, are ſuppoſed to be in ſuch ſort giuen,
as that the longitudes and latitudes of all places, with the true diſtance and
courſe betweene place and place might thereby be truely knowne. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there is no proportionable agreement betweene a Globus ſuperficies
and a plaine ſuperficies, therefore a Chart doth not expreſſe that certaintie of
the premiſſes which is thereby pretended to be giuen, for things are beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
vpon bodies agreeable to their owne forme. And whereas in the true
nature of the Sphere there can be no perallelles deſcribed but the East and
Weſt courſes onely, the reſt of the courſes being concurued lines, aſcendent
toward the Poles, the Meridians all concurring and ioyning together in the

perallells, without any diuerſitie, alteration, or diſtinction to the contrary,

Charts for ſhort courſes are to very good purpoſe for the Pilots vſe, and in
long courſes, be the diſtance neuer ſo farre, if the Pilote returne by the ſame
courſe, whereby in the firſt he proſecuted his voyage, his Chart will be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
errour, as an inſtrument of very great commoditie: but if he returne by
any other way, then by that which hee went foorth, the imperfections of the
Chart will then appeare to be very great, eſpecially if the voyage be long, or
that the ſame be in the North partes of the worlde, the farther towards the
North, the more imperfect: therefore there is no inſtrument anſwerable to
the Globe or peradoxall Chart, for all courſes and climats whatſoeuer, by
whom all deſired truth is moſt plentifully manifeſted, as ſhall hereafter at

                        <item>2 The ſecond is a carefull regarde vnto his ſteredge, with very diligent

impediments.</item>
                        <item>3 And the third is a carefull conſideration of the number of leags that the
Ship ſaileth in euery houre or watch, to the neereſt eſtimation that poſſibly
he can giue, for any two of theſe three practiſes being truely giuen, the third
is therby likewiſe knowne.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>As by the Corſe and height the diſtance is manifeſted, by the diſtance and
Corſe the height is knowne: by the height and diſtance the Corſe is giuen, of
which 3. thinges the Pilote hath onely his height in certaintie: the corſe is
ſomewhat doubtfull, and the diſtance is but barely ſuppoſed, notwithſtanding
from his altitude and corſe he concludeth the truth of his practiſe, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in this ſort.</p>
                     <p>First he conſidereth in what latitude the place ſtandeth from whence hee
ſhapeth his Corſe, which for an example ſhalbe the Lyzart ſtanding in 50. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb facs="tcp:25298:26"/>
of ſeptentrionall latitude, then directing his corſe S. w. ſaileth 3. or 4.
daies or longer in ſuch thick weather, as that he is not able to make any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeraution
of the Poles altitude, in which time he omitteth not to keepe an
accompt how many leages the ſhip hath ſailed vpon that corſe as neere as he
can geſſe, which number of leages in this example ſhalbe 100. according to
his iuugement: then hauing conuenient weather, he obſerueth in what lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
he is, and findeth himſelfe to be in 47. degrees, now with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes
he taketh the diſtance of 100. leages, which is the quantitie of the
Ships runne by his ſuppoſition, and then ſetting one foote of the compaſſes
vpon the Lizart, which is the place from whence hee began his corſe, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
S. W. from the ſame he ſetteth the other point of the compaſſes, by
the direction of another paire of compaſſes, in ſuch ſorce as corſes are found,
and there he maketh a prick for the place of his ſhips being, according to his
reconing and Corſe.</p>
                     <p>And now ſearching whether it doe agree with his height, (for the height,
corſe, and diſtance, muſt all agree together) he findeth that his prick ſtandeth
in 46. degrees, 29. minutes, but it ſhould ſtand in 47. degrees, to agree with
his obſeruation. Therefore perceiuing that he hath giuen the ſhip too much
way, he bringeth his corſe and obſerued altitude to agree, and then hee ſeeth
that his ſhip hath ſailed but 85. leages, and there he layeth downe a prick for
the true place of his ſhips being, according to his corſe and latitude, for ſo by
his corſe and height he findeth the truth of his diſtance, and reproueth his
ſuppoſed accompt to be 15. leags too much: and after this ſort he proceedeth
from place to place, vntill he ariue vnto his deſired porte: which is a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
infallible if there be no other impediments, (whereof there hath not been

there may ariſe many inconueniences.</p>

                     <head>What may thoſe impediments be?</head>
                     <p>BY experience at the Sea we finde many impediments that ſo diſturb the
expected concluſion of our practiſes, as that they agree not with the true
poſitions of arte. For, firſt it is a matter not common to haue the winde ſo
beneficiall, as that a ſhip may ſaile thereby, betweene any two aſſigned places
vpon the direct corſe, but that by the contrarietie of windes, ſhe may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to trauers vpon all the points of the Compaſſe, (the nature whereof
I haue before ſufficiently expreſſed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, although the winde may in ſome ſorte fauour, yet the ſhip may
haue ſuch a leward condition, as that ſhe may make her way 2. or 3. pointes
from her caping.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the ſteredge may be ſo diſorderly handled, as that thereby the
<pb facs="tcp:25298:26"/>
Pylote may be abuſed.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, the compaſſe may be ſo varied, as that the Pylote may likewiſe
thereby be drawne into errour, of all which things and many moe, as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of his ſayling, whether before the winde, quartering, or by a bowling, or
whether with lofty or low ſailes, with the benefites or hinderances of the ſea,
tydegates, ſtreames, and forced ſet thereof, &amp;c. Of all which thinges I ſay,
the ſkilfull Pylote muſt haue carefull conſideration, which are better lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by practiſe then taught by penne: for it is not poſſible that any man can
be a good and ſufficient pylote or ſkilful Seaman, but bypainefull &amp; diligent

                     <p>THere are 3. kindes of Nauigation, Horizontall, Paradoxall, and ſayling
vpon a great Circle, performed by Corſe and trauers.</p>
                     <p>A Corſe is the paradoxall line, which is deſcribed by the Ships motion
vpon any point of Compaſſe.</p>
                     <p>A Trauers is the varietie of the Ships motion vpon euery alteration of
Corſes.</p>
                     <p>The Compaſſe is an artificiall Horizon, by which Corſes and Trauerſes
are directed, and containeth 32. pointes, and euery point containeth 11¼. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
or 45. minutes, being ¾ of an hower.</p>
                     <p>By ſuch quantitie of time as the Moone ſeperateth her ſelfe from the
Sunne, by the like rate of time euery tide doth one differ from another.</p>
                     <p>In euery hower the tide altereth two minutes, in euery flud twelue mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,
and in euery ebbe twelue minutes, and in euery day 48. minutes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that ſo is the Moones ſeperation from the Sunne: for the Moone
doth ſeperate her ſelfe from the Sunne, in euery day one point and 3. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,
betweene the change and the full ſhe is to the Eaſtwardes of the Sun,
and then is her ſeperation, at which time ſhe is before the Sunne in reſpect
of her naturall motion, but in regarde of her violent motion, ſhe is then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
or abaſt the Sunne.</p>
                     <p>Betweene the full and the change, ſhe is to the Weſtward of the Sunne,
applying towards the Sunne, and then is her application, at which time ſhe
is behinde ar abaſt the Sunne, in reſpect of her naturall motion, but in consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of her violent motion, ſhe is then befare the Sunne.</p>
                     <p>She hath a violent motion, a naturall motion, a ſlowe, ſwift, and meane

                     <p>The Moones age is found by the Epact.</p>
                     <p>All inſtruments vſed in Nauigation, of what ſhape or forme ſoeuer they
be, are deſcribed or demonſtrated vpon a Circle, or ſome portion of a Circle,
and therefore are of the nature of a Circle.</p>
                     <p>A degree is the 360. parte of a Circle, how bigge or little ſoeuer the
Circle be.</p>
                     <p>A degree is applied after 6. ſeuerall ſortes, to the Equator, to the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
to the Horizon, to the verticall Circle, to meaſure, and to time.</p>
                     <p>Altitude is the diſtance, height, or mounting of one thing aboue another.</p>
                     <p>The Poles altitude is the diſtance betweene the Pole and the Horizon,

                     <p>The altitude of the Sunne aboue the Horizon, is that portion of the circle
of Azumuth, which is contained betweene the Horizon and the Sunne.</p>

parallell of any place and the Equator, or that part of the Meridian which
is included betweene the Zenith and the Equinoctiall.</p>
                     <p>Longitude is that portion of the Equator contained betweene the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
of <hi>S. Mihels,</hi> one of the Iles of the Aſſones, and the Meridian of the place
whoſe longitude is deſired: the reaſon why the accompt of longitude doth
begin at this Ile, is, becauſe that there the Compaſſe hath no varietie, for the
Meridian of this Ile paſſeth by the Poles of the worlde and the Poles of the
Magnet, being a Meridian proper to both Poles.</p>
                     <p>The longitude betweene place and place, is the portion of the Equator
which is contained betweene the Meridians of the ſame places.</p>
                     <p>Declination is the diſtance of the Sunne, Moone and Starres, from the

any celeſtiall body, and is contained betweene the ſame center and the
Equinoctiall.</p>
                     <p>Hidrographie is the deſcription of the occean Sea, with all Iles, bancks,
rocks and ſands therein contained, whoſe limits extend to the geographicall
borders of the earth, the perfect notice whereof is the cheefeſt thing required
in a ſufficient Pylote, in his excellent practiſe of ſayling.</p>
                     <p>Geographie is the deſcription of the earth onely, whereby the terreſtriall

                     <p>Coſmographie is the deſcription of the heauens, with all that is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

Coſmographie to be the vniuerſall deſcription of the terreſtriall

                     <p>THe vſe of the Equinoctiall, is to know the declination of the Sunne,
Moone &amp; Starres, wherby the latitude of places is giuen, for that por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Meridian which is contained betweene the Equator and the

and ſo continued to the Equinoctiall, that degree and minute in which
the quarter circle dooth touch the Equator, is the Longitude of the ſame
place, or if you bring any place (that is deſcribed vpon the Globe) whoſe Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude
you would know, vnder the Meridian of the Globe, that degree of
the Equinoctiall that is then likewiſe directly vnder the Meridian is the
Longitude deſired. When the ſunne commeth vpon the Equator, then the
Daies and nights are of one length through the whole worlde: and then the
Sunne riſeth vpon the true point of Eaſt, and ſetteth vpon the true point of
Weſt, and not els at any time. This circle being fixed in the firmament, is
moued with the firſt mouer in euery houre 15, degrees, by which accompt in
24. houres his motion is perfourmed. And here note, that the degrees of the
Equinoctiall haue a double application, the one to time, and the other to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:
in reſpect of time 15. degrees make an houre, ſo that euery degree
containeth but 4, minutes of time, but when his degrees haue relation to
meaſure, then euery degree containeth 60. minutes, being 20 leags, ſo that
euery minute ſtandeth for a mile after our Engliſh accompt.</p>
                     <p>But this allowance of 20. leags to euery degree of the Equinoctiall, in
ſayling, or meaſuring of diſtances vpon the East and West Corſes, is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
when you are vnder the ſame, becauſe the Equinoctiall being a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allell,

there are not 20. Leags to be allowed to euery degree, becauſe ſuch peral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelles

the perallelles, and the leſſer that any perallell is, the leſſer are his degrees,
becauſe euery circle containeth 360. degrees, and as the circles and degrees
are diminiſhed in their quantitie, in like ſorte the diſtance anſwerable to ſuch

Seamen, and is an excellent inſtrument being rightly underſtoode
and ordered, but ſith the vnlgare Aſtrolabie with his vſe is to euery Seaman
ſufficiently knowne, it ſhould be vaine labour for me to lay downe his vſe
and demonſtration: therefore by his fourme it ſhall ſuffiſe to expreſſe him.</p>

                     <p>THere hath been great paines taken by many for the enlarging of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
contained in an Aſtrolabie, among which there is a proiection to
conueye the degrees of a quadrant into the concauery of a Aſtrolabie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
thoſe degrees ſhalbe double, to any other Aſtrolabie of the ſame quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
ſo that the Sunne beame pearcing a hole made in the ſide of the Aſtrola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie,
is thereby caried to the degrees noted, in the oppoſite concaue parte, as
by his forme may appere.</p>
                     <p>Also my ſelfe labouring in the ſame matter, haue found a meane whereby
an Ark of quadrant whoſe ſide is 10. foote, may be conueied into an Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labie
of 10. inches diameter, whoſe dioptra ſhall cut his lymbe to right an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles,
and ſhall perfourme the complement of 90 degrees, as amply and as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
as by the quadrant it may in any ſort be done.</p>
                     <p>Whoſe demonſtration, together with the demonſtration of my Staffe, A
purpose God willing, at large to manifeſt. But there can be no inuention
that can eſtabliſh the certaintie of the vſe of either Quadrant or Aſtrolabie at
the Sea, for vnleſſe it be in very ſmoothe water, there can be no certaintie of
<pb facs="tcp:25298:48"/>
any obſeruation by thoſe inſtruments, whereby the Seaman may reſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of the la. which he ſeeketh, but the obſeruations made by the croſſe ſtaffe,
are without all diſtruſt of errour, and therfore no inſtrument may compare
with the excellencie of the croſſe ſtaffe for the Seamans vſe.</p>
