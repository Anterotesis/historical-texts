            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

First, He poured in the Vinegar of the Law, then the Wine of the Gospel. This was that preaching made men studiously seek after Heaven: <hi>John</hi> did not so much preach to please, as to profit; he chose rather to discover mens sins, than to shew his own eloquence. That is the best looking-glass, not which is most gilded, but which shews the truest face. That Preaching is to be preferred, which makes the truest discovery of mens sins, and shews them their hearts. <hi>John Baptist was a burning and a shining light;</hi> he did burn in his Doctrine, and shine in his Life; and from that time men pressed into Heaven. <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p n="1">1. What violence is not meant here: <note place="margin">1.</note> This <hi>violence</hi> in the text excludes 1. An <hi>ignorant violence;</hi> to be violent for that which we do not understand, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 23. <hi>As I passed by, and beheld your Devotions, I found an Altar with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,</hi>

            <p n="2">2. It excludes a bloody violence, which is two-fold: First, when one goes to lay violent hands upon himself. The body is an earthly prison, where God hath put the Soul; we must not break Prison, but stay till God by death lets us out. The Sentinel is not to stir without leave from his Captain: nor must we dare to stir hence, without <hi>Gods</hi> leave. Our Bodies are the Temples of the Holy Ghost, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19. when we offer violence to them, we destroy <hi>Gods</hi> Temple. The Lamp of life must burn so long as any natural moisture is left like oil to feed it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When one takes away the life of another. There's too much of this violence now adays. No sin hath a louder voice than blood, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 10. <hi>The voice of</hi>

1. What absolute need there is to <note place="margin">1.</note> stir up our selves to holy Duties.</p>
            <p>In respect of the sluggishness of our <note place="margin">1.</note> hearts to that which is spiritual; blunt tools need whetting; a dull creature needs spurrs. Our hearts are dull and heavy in the things of God, therefore we had need spur them on, and provoke them to that which is good. The flesh hinders from duty: when we would pray, the flesh resists; when we should suffer, the flesh draws back. How hard is it sometimes to get leave of our hearts to seek God? Jesus Christ went more willingly to the Cross, than we do to the Throne of Grace. Had not we need then provoke our selves to duty? If our hearts are so unstrung in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, we had need prepare and put them in tune.</p>
            <p>The exercises of Gods Worship are contrary to nature; therefore there <note place="margin">2.</note> must be a provoking of our selves to them. The motion of the Soul to sin, is <hi>natural,</hi> but its motion towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is <hi>violent.</hi> The stone moves easily to the Centre; it hath an innate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penseness downward; but to draw up a Milstone into the Air, is done by

Yet this Tree of the Promise would not drop its fruit, till shaken with the hand of prayer, <hi>verse</hi> 37. <hi>For all this will I yet be enquired.</hi> The brest of Gods mercy is full, but prayer must draw the brest.

Profession of the Gospel. How may this encourage us, and make us hoise up the sails of prayer, when others of the Saints have had such good returns from the holy Land.</p>
            <p>That we may put forth this holy vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in prayer, it is requisite there be a renewed principle of grace. If the person be graceless, no wonder the prayer is heartless. The body while it is dead hath no heat in it: while a man is dead in sin, he can have no heat in duty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we may be the more violent in prayer, it is good to pray with a sense of our wants. A begger that is pinched with want, will be earnest in craving an alms. Christian, review thy wants; thou wantest an humble spiritual frame of heart; thou wantest the light of Gods countenance; the sense of want will quicken prayer. That man can never pray fervently, that doth not pray feelingly.

            <p>The fourth Duty wherein we must <note place="margin">4. <hi>Duty.</hi>
               </note> offer violence to our selves, is <hi>Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> a duty wherein the very heart and life-blood of Religion lies. St. <hi>Bernard</hi> calls Meditation <hi>animae viaticum,</hi> a bait by the way <note n="*" place="margin">Bern in Cant.</note>. And another saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Periand.</note>. Meditation may be thus described; It is an holy excercise of the mind, whereby we bring the truths of God to remembrance, and do seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously ponder upon them, and apply them to our selves. In meditation there are two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Christians retiring of himself, a locking himself up from the world. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation is a work which cannot be done in a croud.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a serious thinking on God. It is not a few transient thoughts that are quickly gone, but a fixing and staying the mind upon heavenly objects: This cannot be done without exciting all the powers of our souls, and offering violence to our selves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:56017:30"/>
We are the more to provoke our selves to this duty, because</p>
            <p n="1">1. Meditation is so cross to flesh and blood. Naturally we shun holy medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. To meditate on worldly secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar things, if it were all day, we can do it without any diversion <note n="*" place="margin">

The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural averseness from this duty shews, we are to offer violence to our selves in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Satan doth what he can to hinder this duty. He is an enemy to medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Devil cares not how much we hear, nor how little we meditate. Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing begets knowledge, but meditation begets devotion. Meditation doth bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>last the heart, and make it serious; and Satan labours to keep the heart from being serious. What need therefore is there of offering violence to our selves in this duty? But me-thinks I hear some say, when they sit alone they know not what to meditate of; I shall therefore surnish them with matter of medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

            <p n="1">1. The serious meditation of this would produce Repentance. How could we look upon him <hi>whom we have pierced,</hi> and not mourn over him? When we consider how dear our sins cost Christ; how should we shed the blood of our sins which shed Christ's blood?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The meditation of Christ's death would fire our hearts with love to Christ. What friend shall we love, if not him who died for us? His love to us made him cruel to himself.

            <p>But where is the meditating Christian? Here I might lament the want of holy meditation. Most people live in a hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; they are so distracted with the cares of the world, that they can find no time to meditate; or scarce ask their Souls <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> they do. We are not like the Saints in former Ages. <hi>David</hi> did me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate in Gods Precepts, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 15. <hi>Isaac walked in the evening to meditate, Gen.</hi> 24. 63. He did take a turn with God. What devout meditations do we read in St. <hi>Austin</hi> and <hi>Anselm?</hi> But it is too much out of date among our modern Christians.</p>
            <q>—Terras Astraea reliquit.—</q>
            <p>Those Beasts under the Law which did not chew the cud were unclean. Such as do not chew the cud by holy medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are to be reckoned among the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean. But I shall rather turn my <hi>lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> into a <hi>perswasion,</hi> entreating Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56017:35"/>
to offer violence to themselves in this so necessary Duty of Meditation. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> sequestred himself from all society, and lived in a Cave for a whole year, that he might meditate upon Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy. How then should we retire and lock up our selves at least once a day that we may meditate upon Glory.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Meditation makes the Word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to profit; it works it upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. As the Bee sucks the flower; so by meditation we suck out the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a Truth. It is not the receiving of meat into the mouth; but the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesting of it makes it nutritive. So it is not the receiving the most excellent truths in at the ear, that nourisheth our souls, but the digesting them by Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Wine poured into a sieve run<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> out. Many truths are lost, because Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters pour this Wine into sieves, either into leaking Memories, or feathery minds. Meditation is like a soaking rain, that goes to the root of a Tree, and makes it bring forth fruit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Holy meditation quickens the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 97. <hi>O how I love thy Law! It is my meditation all the day.</hi> The reason our affections are so cold to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56017:36"/>
heavenly things, is, because we do not warm them at the fire of holy medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As the musing on amorous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects makes the fire of lust burn; the musing on injuries makes the fire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge burn: so meditating on the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent beauties of Christ, would make our love to Christ flame forth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Meditation hath a transforming pow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> in it. The hearing of the Word may affect us; but the meditating of it doth transform us, Meditation stamps the impression of Divine Truths upon our hearts. By meditating of God's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, we grow holy. As <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Cattel by looking on the Rods, <hi>conceived like the Rods:</hi> so while by meditation we look upon God's purity, we are chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into his likeness, and are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his Divine Nature.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Meditation produceth Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 59. <hi>I thought on my wayes, and turned my feet unto thy Testimonies.</hi> Did but people meditate on the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableness of sin; did they but think when they meddle with it, there is a Rope at the end of it, which will hang them eternally in Hell; they would break off a course of sinning, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

new Creatures. Let all this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade to holy meditation. I dare be bold to say, if men would spend but one quarter of an hour every day in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating heavenly objects, it would leave a mighty impression upon them, and through the blessing of God might prove the beginning of an happy conversion.</p>

            <p>Get a love to spiritual things. We usually meditate on those things which <note place="margin">Answ.</note> we love. The voluptuous man can muse on his pleasures: the covetous man on his bags of gold. Did we love heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, we should meditate more on them. Many say, they cannot meditate, because they want memory; but is it not rather because they want affection? Did they love the things of God, they would make them their continual study and meditation.</p>

It is a parlying with ones own heart, <hi>Psalm</hi> 77. 7. <hi>I commune with my own heart. David</hi> did put interrogatories to himself. Self-examination is the setting
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56017:37"/>
up a Court in Conscience, and keeping a Register there, that by a strict scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny a man may know how things stand between God and his own Soul. Self-examination is a <hi>spiritual Inquisition;</hi> a bringing ones self to trial. A good Christian doth as it were begin the day of Judgement here in his own Soul. Self-searching is an Heart-Anatomy. As a Chirurgion, when he makes a Disse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Body, discovers the <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stina,</hi> the inward parts, the Heart, Liver, Arteries: so, a Christian anatomizeth himself; he searcheth what is flesh, and what is spirit; what is sin, and what grace, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77. 7. <hi>My spirit made diligent search:</hi> As the Woman in the Gospel did light a Candle, and search for her lost Groat, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 8. So Conscience is the <hi>Candle of the Lord, Prov.</hi> 20. 27. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian by the Light of this Candle must search his Soul if he can find any grace there. The Rule by which a Christian must try himself, is the Word of God, Phancy and Opinion are false Rules to go by. We must judge of our spiritual condition by the Canon of Scripture. This <hi>David</hi> calls a <hi>Lamp unto his feet, Psalm</hi> 119. 105. Let the Word be the

            <p n="1">1. Because the duty in it self is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult: 1. It is <hi>act us reflexivus,</hi> a work of self-reflection; it lies most with the heart. 'Tis hard to look inward. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal acts of Religion are facil; to lift up the eye to Heaven, to bow the Knee, to read a prayer; this requires no more labour than for a Papist to tell over his beads; but to examine a mans self, to turn in upon his own Soul, to take the Heart as a Watch all in pieces, and see what is defective, this is not easie. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexive acts are hardest.</hi> The eye can see every thing but it self. It is easie to spy the faults of others, but hard to find out our own. 2. Examination of a mans self is difficult, because of self-love. As ignorance blinds; so self-love flatters. Every man is ready to think the best of himself. What <hi>Solomon</hi> saith of love

A man looking upon himself in <hi>Philautiae speculo,</hi> in the glass of self-love, his vertues appear greater than they are, and his sins lesser.

               </gap>t which causeth a back wardness to self-examination, is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Consciousness of guilt.</hi> Sin clamours inwardly, and men are loth to look into their hearts, lest they should find that which should trouble them. It is little pleasure to read the <hi>Hand-writing</hi> on the wall of conscience. Many Christians are like trades-men that are sinking in their Estates; they are loth to look over their Books, or cast up their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, lest they should find their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states low: So they are loth to look into their guilty hearts, lest they should find something there, which should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright them: as <hi>Moses</hi> was affrighted at the sight of the <hi>Rod</hi> turned into a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</p>

How confident are some of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet never examine their title to Heaven?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Men are not forward to examine themselves; because they rest in the good opinion of others: how vain is this! Alas, one may be Gold and Pearl in the eye of others; yet God may judge him <hi>Reprobate Silver:</hi> others may think him a Saint; and God may write him down in his black-book. <hi>Judas</hi> was looked upon by the rest of the Apostles, as a true Believer; they would have been ready to have given their hands to his certificate; yet he was a Traitor.

            <p n="4">4. Men are hardly brought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine themselves, because they do not believe Scripture. The Scripture saith, The <hi>heart is deceitful</hi> above all things, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 9. <hi>Solomon</hi> said, there were four things too wonderful for him that he could not know, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 19. He might have added a fifth; <hi>The Way of mans heart.</hi> The heart is the greatest Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor; it will be ready to put one off with seeming Grace, instead of saving. The heart will perswade that a slight tear is Repentance; a lazy desire is Faith. Now because the generality of people do not believe that there is such fallacy in their hearts, therefore they are so slow to examine them. This natural backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in us to self-reflection, should cause us to offer the more violence to our selves in making a thorow disquisition and search of our hearts.</p>
            <p>Oh that I might prevail with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, to take pains with themselves in this great work of Examination. Their salvation depends on it. It is the note of an Harlot; she is seldom at home, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 11, 12. <hi>Her feet abide</hi>

               <hi>not in her house; now is she without, now in the streets.</hi> It is a sign of an Harlot; Professor, to be altogether abroad, spy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the faults of others; but is never at home with his own heart. Oh let us try our Hearts, as we do Gold by the <hi>Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</hi> Let us examine our sins, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out this <hi>leven,</hi> burn it.

So many think they have Grace, the <hi>right Herb;</hi> but it proves a <hi>wild gourd,</hi> and brings death and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That we may offer violence to our selves in this great business of <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,</hi> let these few things be serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weighed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Without self-examination we can never know how it is with us. If we should die presently, we cannot tell to what Coast we should sail; whether to Hell or Heaven. It is reported of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> when he was going out of the World, he had this speech, <hi>I am now to dye, and the gods know whether I shall be happy or iniserable.</hi> That man who is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the state of his Soul, must

Keepest thou the Sabbath?</hi> the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer was made, <hi>Christianus sum,</hi> I am a Christian, and dare not omit the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Lords day. What great cause have we thankfully to remember this day! As the benefit of <hi>Israel</hi>'s deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56017:41"/>
from the <hi>Babylonish</hi> captivity was so great, that it drowned the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their deliverance from <hi>Egypt, Jer.</hi> 16. 14. So the benefit of our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from Satan's captivity, and the rising of Christ from finishing the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious work of our Redemption was so famous, that in respect of this, his other benefits receive as it were a diminution. Great was the work of Creation; but greater the work of Redemption. It cost more to redeem us, than make us. In the one, there was only the speaking a word, <hi>Psal.</hi> 148. 5 in the other the shedding of blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 22. The Creation was the work of God's <hi>fingers, Psal.</hi> 8. 3. the Redemption, the work of his <hi>arm, Luke</hi> 1. 5. In the Creation God gave us <hi>ourselves;</hi> in the Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption he gave us <hi>himself.</hi> So that the Sabbath putting us in mind of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, ought to be observed with the highest devotion, Herein we must offer holy violence to our selves.</p>
            <p>When this blessed day approacheth, we should labour, that as the day is sanctified; so our hearts may be sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
            <p>We must on this day <hi>rest from all the</hi>

               <hi>works of our calling.</hi> As <hi>Abraham</hi> when he went to Sacrifice, left his Servant and Ass at the bottom of the hill, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 5. So when we are to worship God this day, we must leave all secular bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness behind. And as <hi>Joseph</hi> when he would speak with his Brethren, thrust out the <hi>Egyptians:</hi> so, when we would have converse with God this day, we must thrust out all earthly employments. Though works of <hi>necessity</hi> may be done, and works of <hi>charity,</hi> (for God will have mercy, and not sacrifice); yet in other cases we must cease from all worldly negotiations. It is observable concerning <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> that she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to anoint Christ's dead body on the Sabbath day, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 56. She had before prepared her ointment, but came not to the Sepulchre till the Sabbath was past. She rested that day from <hi>civil work,</hi> though it were a commendable and glorious work (the anointing of Christ's dead body).</p>
            <p>When this blessed day approacheth, <note place="margin">2.</note> we must lift up our hearts in thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to God, that he hath put another <hi>price into our hands</hi> for the gaining of heavenly wisdom. These are our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56017:42"/>
harvest-daies; now the wind of God's Spirit blows upon the sails of our affections, and we may be much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered on in our heavenly voyage. Christian, lift up thy heart to God in thankfulness, that he hath given thee another golden season, and be sure thou improve it; it may be thy last. Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of grace are not like the <hi>Tyde;</hi> if a man misleth one tyde, he may have another.</p>
            <p>This day approaching, we must in the <note place="margin">3.</note> morning dress and fit our souls for the receiving of the Word. The people of <hi>Israel</hi> must wash their garments before the Law was delivered to them. Our hearts must be washed by prayer and repentance, the Oracles of God being to be delivered to us.</p>
            <p>And being met together, we must set our selves as in the presence of God with seriousness and delight to hear God's sacred Word. Take heed of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions which fly-blow our duties.</p>
            <p>We must labour to be bettered by <note place="margin">4.</note> every Sabbath: where the Lord laies out cost, he looks for fruit. Fresh anointings of God are to be thirsted after; and new cubits to be added to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56017:43"/>
our spiritual <hi>stature.</hi> We must not be like the <hi>Salamander,</hi> which lives in the fire, but is never the hotter. Christians should on these daies aspire after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, and endeavour to have the illapses of his Spirit, and clearer discoveries of his love in Christ. In short, we should do on a Sabbath as <hi>Moses;</hi> he ascended the <hi>Mount</hi> that he might have a sight of God.</p>
            <p>We must dedicate the whole day to <note place="margin">5.</note> God. Under the Law a single Sacrifice was appointed for other daies of the week; but two Lambs were to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered upon the Sabbath. All this day must be spent with God: he must have worship in the publick; and when we come home, he must have family-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. Many leave all their Religion at Church (as I have seen some do their Bibles) not hallowing God's name in their own houses, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Will a man rob God?</hi> When men pretend to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God in the Temple, but cut him short of family and closet-duties on a Sabbath; this is to rob God, and steal a part of his day from him.</p>
            <p>Good reason we should consecrate the whole Sabbath to God, and give
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56017:43"/>
him <hi>double devotion,</hi> for God <hi>doubles his blessings</hi> upon us this day. As the <hi>Manna</hi> did rain twice as much on the sixth day, as any of the other daies: so the <hi>Manna</hi> of spiritual blessings falls twice as much on the Sabbath day as any other.</p>
            <p>We must rejoyce in this day, as being <note place="margin">6.</note> a day wherein we enjoy much of God's presence, <hi>John</hi> 8. 56. <hi>Abraham saw my day and rejoyced.</hi> So when we see a Sabbath day coming, we should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce. The Protestants in <hi>France</hi> called their Church <hi>Paradise,</hi> because there they met with God<note n="*" place="margin">Sleidan.</note>. The <hi>Jews</hi> called the Sabbath, <hi>desiderium dierum, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of daies, Isa.</hi> 58. 13. <hi>Thou shalt call the Sabbath a delight.</hi> This we should look upon as the best day, as the <hi>Queen of daies,</hi> crowned with a blessing, <hi>Psal.</hi> 118. 24. <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoyce and be glad in it.</hi> He hath <hi>made</hi> all the daies, but hath <hi>sanctified</hi> this. We should look upon this day as a spiritual <hi>Mart</hi> for our souls, wherein we have holy commerce and traffick with God. This day of <hi>Rest</hi> is the beginning of an eternal rest. This day God sets open the <hi>Pool of Bethesda,</hi> in which those waters flow that refresh
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56017:44"/>
the broken in heart. And shall not we call this day <hi>a delight?</hi> The Jews on the Sabbath laid aside their Sackcloth and Mourning.</p>
            <p>This is in a right manner to sanctifie a duty; and it is a duty wherein Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians must excite and offer violence to themselves.</p>
            <p>Above all others, how well doth it become those into whose hands God hath-put the power of Magistracy, to shew forth holy violence in causing the Lord's day to be strictly observed? What a rare pattern hath <hi>Nehemiah</hi> set all good Magistrates, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13. 15. <hi>In those daies saw I in Judah some treading wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheavs, and all manner of burdens which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day; and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals,</hi> Vers. 17. <hi>Then I contended with the Nobles of Juda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

'Tis the fault of Christians, that they do not in company provoke themselves to set good discourse on foot: it is a sinfull modesty: there is much visiting, but they do not give one anothers souls a visit.

            <p>Holy discourse will be a means to <note place="margin">5.</note> bring Christ into our company.

            <p>In suiting his temptations to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion <note place="margin">1.</note> and temper of the body. Satan studies the Physiognomy, and laies suitable baits.

               </gap>ilty is to draw men to evil, <hi>sub specie boni,</hi> under a pretence of good. The Pirate doth mischief by

He puts some men upon sinful actions, and perswades them much good will come of it. He tells them in some cases they may dispense with the Rule of the Word, and stretch their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence beyond that line that they may be in a capacity of doing more service. As if God needed our sin to raise his glory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Satan tempts to sin gradually. As the Husbandman digs about the root of a tree, and by degrees loosens it, and at last it falls. Satan steals by degrees into the heart: he is at first more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest: He did not say to <hi>Eve</hi> at first, <hi>Eat the Apple;</hi> no, but he goes more subtilly to work; he puts forth a question, <hi>Hath God said?</hi> sure <hi>Eve</hi> thou art mistaken; the bountiful God never intended to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar thee one of the best trees of the Garden. <hi>Hath God said?</hi> sure, either God did not say it; or if he did, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver really intended it. Thus by degrees he wrought her to distrust, and then she took of the fruit and eat. Oh take heed of Satan's first motions to sin, that seem more modest<hi>—principiis obsta—</hi>

He is first a <hi>Fox,</hi> and then a <hi>Lion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Satan tempts to evil <hi>in licitis,</hi> in lawful things. It was lawful for <hi>Noah</hi> to eat the fruit of the Grape; but he took too much, and so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Industry in ones calling (when excessive) is covetousness. Satan draws men to an immoderate love of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and then makes them offend in that which they love.

            <p n="5">5. Satan puts men upon doing good out of bad ends: if he cannot hurt them by <hi>scandalous</hi> actions, he will by <hi>virtuous</hi> actions. Thus he tempts some to espouse Religion out of policy to get preferment; and to give alms for applause, that others may see their good works, and canonize them. This hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie doth leven the duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and make them lose their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Devil perswades to evil by such as are good. This sets a gloss up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his temptations, and makes them less suspected. The Devil hath made

use sometimes of the eminentest and holiest men to promote his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Devil tempted Christ by an Apostle. <hi>Peter</hi> disswades him from suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. <hi>Abraham</hi> a good man bids his wife equivocate: <hi>Say, Thou art my Sister.</hi> These are his subtilties in tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

            <p n="2">2. We must offer violence to Satan by prayer. We overcome him upon our knees. As <hi>Sampson</hi> called to Heaven for

allegories and metaphors which imply violence.</p>

            <p n="2">2. Wrestling, which is a violent exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 12. We are to wrestle with a body of sin, and with the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of Hell.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Running in a Race, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 24. <hi>So run that ye may obtain.</hi> We have a long Race from Earth to Heaven, and but a little time to run; it will soon be sun-set. Therefore <hi>so run.</hi> In a Race there's not only laying aside all weights that hinder; but a putting forth all the strength of the body; a straining every joynt that men may press on with all swiftness to lay hold on the prize. Thus Saint <hi>Paul</hi> presseth <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>towards the mark, Phil.</hi> 3. 14. Alas, where is this holy violence to be found?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Many have made themselves unfit to run this blessed Race; they are drunk with the pleasures of the world. A drunken man is unfit to run a Race.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Others neglect to run this Race all their life; and when sickness and

death approach, now they will begin. A sick man is very unfit to walk, much less to run a Race. I acknowledge, true Repentance is never too late; but when a man can hardly stir his hand, or lift up his eyes, now is a very unfit time to begin the Race from earth to Heaven.</p>

            <p>The Reasons why there must be this <note place="margin">1.</note> offering violence to Heaven, are</p>
            <p n="1">1. God's indispensible command. He hath enacted a Law, that whosoever eats of the fruit of Paradise, shall eat it in the sweat of his brow, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56017:51"/>
               <hi>Give diligence to make your calling and election sure.</hi> The Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, imports an anxious solicitous care about salvation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God's decree. The Lord hath in his eternal decree joyned the end and the means together; <hi>striving</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring;</hi> the <hi>Race</hi> and the <hi>Crown.</hi> And a man can no more think to come to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven without offering violence, than he can think to come to the end of his Journey, that never sets a step in the way. Who expects an harvest with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out plowing and sowing? How can we expect the harvest of glory without la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Though our salvation in respect of <hi>Christ</hi> is a purchase; yet in respect of <hi>us,</hi> it is a conquest.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We must offer violence to Heaven in regard of the difficulty of the work; <hi>Taking a Kingdom.</hi> First, we must be pulled out of another Kingdom, <hi>The Kingdom of darkness</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 26. 18.</note>. To get out of the state of nature is hard, and when that is done, and we are cut off from the wild Olive, and implanted into Christ, there is new work still to do; new sins to mortifie; new temptations to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist; new graces to quicken. A Christian
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56017:52"/>
must not only get Faith, but go <hi>from Faith to Faith, Rom.</hi> 1. 17. This will not be done without violence.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We must offer violence to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in regard of the violent assaults made against us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our own hearts oppose us. 'Tis a strange Paradox: Man who doth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally desire happiness, yet opposeth it: he desires to be saved, yet hates that holy violence which should save him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All the powers of Hell oppose us. Satan <hi>stands at our right hand,</hi> as he did at <hi>Joshuah</hi>'s, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. 2. Shall not we be as earnest to save our souls, as the <hi>Dragon</hi> is to devour them? Without violent affections, we shall never resist violent temptations.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We must be violent, because it is a matter of the highest importance. A man doth not beat his head about trifles, but matters wherein his life and estate are concerned. Violence is to be offered, if we consider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What we shall save: <hi>The precious soul.</hi> What pains do we take for the feeding and enriching the body, <hi>the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56017:52"/>
should we use for the saving the soul? The body is but a Ring of Clay, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

There are in the soul some sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and faint representations of a Deity. If Christ thought the soul worth shedding his blood, well may we think it worth spending our sweat.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Consider what we shall gain? a <hi>Kingdom.</hi> What violence is used for earthly Crowns and Empires; men will wade to the Crown through blood. Heaven is a Kingdom which should make us strive for it, <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Non ad sudorem tantum sed sanguinem, even to blood.</hi> The hopes of a Kingdom (saith St. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil)</hi> should carry a Christian chearfully through all labours and sufferings.</p>
            <p>There must be offering violence in <note place="margin">6.</note> regard of that aptness and proneness in the best to grow remiss in Religion. When they have been quickned in a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they are apt to grow dead again. When they have been heat at the fire of an Ordinance, they are apt to freeze again; therefore they must be still of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering violence. The heart, like the Watch, will be apt to go down; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56017:53"/>
must be ever and anon wound up by prayer and meditation. The fire of devotion will soon go out, if it be not blown up. A Christian's own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his inconstancy in good, is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent enough to holy violence.</p>

Is salvation-work so facil? can a man be saved <hi>per saltum?</hi> can he leap out of the Devil's arms into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>bosom?</hi> Oh no, there must be offering violence.

The promise tells us of a <hi>Crown;</hi> but the precept saith, <hi>So run,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 24. The promises are made to encourage faith, not to cherish sloth. But say others, Christ hath died for sinners; and so they leave him to do all for them, and they will do nothing.

            <p n="2">2. It shews us the great mistake of <note place="margin">2. Branch.</note> ignorant people, who think the bare doing of duties, though in never so slight superficial a manner is enough. The text tells us of <hi>offering violence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. In the business of <hi>Prayer:</hi> They think it is enough to mutter over a few words, though the heart be asleep all the while: what offering of violence is here? Christ was <hi>in an Agony</hi> at prayer, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 44. Many when they pray are rather in a Lethargy than in an Agony. <hi>Jacob</hi> wrestled with the Angel in prayer, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 24. The Incense was to be laid upon burning coals, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 22. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense</hi> was a type of prayer, and the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense upon coals,</hi> was a type of fervency in prayer. Few know what the spirit of prayer means; or what it is to have the affections boil over. When they are about the world they are all <hi>Fire;</hi> when they are at prayer they are all <hi>Ice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In <hi>Hearing of the Word:</hi> Many people think it is enough to bring their bodies to the Assembly, but they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver look to their hearts. They satisfie themselves that they have been at Church, though they have not been
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56017:55"/>
with God there. Others go to a Sermon as to the Exchange, to <hi>hear news;</hi> new notions that please their phancy, but do not attend to the word as about a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life and death. They do not go to meet with Christ in an Ordinance; to have the breathings of his Spirit, and the infusions of his Love. Alas, what little violence for Heaven is to be seen in most peoples worship? In all the Sacrifices of the Law there was fire. How can those duties be accepted, which have no fire in them; no offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of violence?</p>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Consunptive.</hi> There are two signs of persons in a spiritual consumption.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When their desire after Christ and Heaven is not so strong as it was. A consumptive man's stomach decaies. Christians have not such violent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to heavenly things; they can desire <hi>Corn</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> and the luscious delights of the earth; but, Christ is less precious; they are not in pangs of desire after him, a sad symptom their grace is in a consumption.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When they are not so vigorous in motion. A man that is lively and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his work, it is a sign he is in health; but when he is listless, and cares not to stir, or put his hand to any thing; a sign nature is a declining. So when men have no heart to that which is good, they care not to put themselves upon the exercises of Religion; they have lost a spirit of activity for God;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56017:62"/>
they serve him in a faint sickly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; 'tis a sign they are consumptive.</p>
            <p>When the pulse can scarce be felt, it beats so low; men are near dying: So when those who were once violent for Heaven, but now we can scarce per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any good in them, the pulse beats low, grace is <hi>ready to dye, Rev.</hi> 3. 2. <note n="*" place="margin">

evil have you found <hi>in the Word?</hi> Time was when you did take this Book and <hi>eat it,</hi> and it was <hi>hony in your mouth?</hi> Hath the Word less vertue in it now? Are the Promises like <hi>Aaron's dry Rod</hi> withered and sapless? What iniquity have you found <hi>in the waies of God,</hi> that you have abated your former vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in Religion? <hi>O remember whence you are fallen and repent, and do your first works, Rev.</hi> 2. 5. Consider seriously,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The less violence for Heaven, the less peace. Our consciences are never at peace in a drowsie state. It is the lively acting of grace makes the heart calm and serene. These two go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, walking <hi>in the fear of God,</hi> and <hi>in the comforts of the Holy Ghost, Acts</hi> 9. 31. Christian, if once thou growest remiss in Religion, conscience will chide. If thou belongest to God, he will never let thee be quiet, but will send some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction or other to awaken thee out of thy security, and make thee recover that active lively frame of heart as once thou hadst.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You that grow more dead in God's service, and <hi>leave your first love,</hi> give great advantage to Satan. The less vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56017:63"/>
you are, the more violent he is; the less you pray, the more he tempts: and what a case are you now in? How can grace that is weak and sickly withstand violent temptations; Hence it is, God suffers his own people sometimes to fall into sin, as a just punishment of their lukewarmness, and to make them more zealous and violent for the future.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Your remisness in Religion, though it may not damn you, it will dammage you. You will lose that degree of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which else you might have had. Though your remisness may not lose your Crown, it will lessen it, and make it weigh lighter.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The more lazy a Christian's desires are, the more lively his corruptions. The weaker the body grows, the stronger the disease grows. Oh therefore pray for qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p n="2">2. It reproves those who have quite <note place="margin">2. Branch. Reproof.</note> left off all violence: they have left off reading and praying in their family. There is not so much as a face of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56017:63"/>

            <p>But, Why do men thus run retrograde in their motion, and quite throw off that violence which they seem'd once to have?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because they never had a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of spiritual life <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>. Things that move from a principle of life are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, as the motion of the pulse: but things artificial are apt to be at a stand, and their motion ceaseth. As a clock when the weights are hung on, goes; but take off the weights, and it stands. So the Apostate never moves in Religion, but for gain and applause; and when these weights are taken off, he is at a stand, he goes no further. That branch must needs wither that hath no root to grow upon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Men throw off all violence, and degenerate into Apostasie, because they never did duties of Religion with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. St. <hi>Paul delighted in the Law of God in the inward man, Rom.</hi> 7. 22. It was
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56017:64"/>
his Heaven to serve God. A man that delights in pleasure will never give over: but the Apostate never had any true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the waies of God; he was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forced with fear, than drawn with love: he served a Master that he never cared for; no wonder then he leaves his service.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Men degenerate into Apostasie through unbelief, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 22. <hi>They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not in God,</hi> vers. 41. <hi>They turned back and tempted God.</hi> Sinners have jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thoughts of God; they distrust his love, therefore desert his service: they think they may pray, and hear, and to no purpose, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>What profit is it that we have kept his Ordina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nes?</hi> We may draw near to God in duty, but He will never draw near to us in mercy. Thus Unbelief and Atheism prevailing, the livery of Religion is presently thrown off, and all former violence for Heaven ceaseth. Infidelity is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Apostasie.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Men leave off their former vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and prove <hi>Judasses</hi> and Devils be cause they love something else more than Religion. There is some lust or other their heart is ingaged to and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56017:64"/>
their violence for sin hath destroyed their violence for Religion. <hi>Solyman</hi> the great Turk, seeing many Christians go over to Turcism, he asked them, What moved them to turn Turks? They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, <hi>They did it to be eased of their Taxes.</hi> They were drawn from God through the prevalency of covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. If there be any lust in the heart predominant, it will get head, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy all former zeal for Religion. <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meleck</hi> a Bastard, destroyed <hi>threescore and ten of his Brethren upon one stone, Judg.</hi> 9. 15. If there be any lust the heart runs after, this bastard-sin will destroy threescore and ten duties; it will mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all that violence for Heaven which a man did once seem to have.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Men leave off former violence out of pusillanimity: if they are violent in Religion, they fear they may lose their profits and preferments; nay, their lives. The coward never yet won the field. When carnal fear grows violent, all violence for Heaven is at an end.</p>
            <q>—Incipit esse malus, qui timet esse bonus—</q>
            <p>Many of the <hi>Jews</hi> who were great fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56017:65"/>
of Christ, when they <hi>saw the swords and staves,</hi> left him. <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 25. <hi>In the fear of man there is a snare.</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fear makes sin appear less than it is, but danger greater.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Men leave off violence for Heaven for want of patience. Sensible feeling of joy is with-held, and they have not patience to stay for the full recompence of reward. Hypocrites are all for <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent pay;</hi> and if they have not that sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly which they desire, they bid adieu to Religion; and say, as that wicked King, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6. 33. <hi>Why should I wait for the Lord any longer?</hi> They consider not that God is a <hi>free Agent,</hi> and will dispense his blessings in the fittest sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but they go to tye God up to their time. They forget that joy is a part of the reward, and would they have the reward and their work not yet finished? Doth the servant use to receive his pay before his work is done? <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>The Husbandman waits for his precious fruits of the earth:</hi> He doth not look to sow and reap in a day. But Hypocrites are alwaies in haste; they would reap joy, before they have done sowing the seed of Repentance: and because comfort
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56017:65"/>
is a while deferred, they are offended; they will serve God no longer: their patience is at an end, therefore their violence is at an end.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Men leave off holy violence, and degenerate into prophaneness, out of a just judgement of God, leaving them to themselves; they oft resisted the Spirit, and sent it away sad from them, and now as a just judgement, God saith, <hi>My Spirit shall no longer strive;</hi> and if this wind doth not blow upon their sails, they cannot move. If this Sun with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from their climate, they must needs freeze in impenitency. They before sinned against clear convictions; they silenced conscience, and God hath seared it. And now if an Angel should preach to them from Heaven, it would do them no good. O how dismal is this! the thoughts of it may strike us into an holy consternation. Thus we see why men apostatize and leave off their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence for Heaven.</p>
            <p>Well, but what do they get by this? let us see what a purchase Apostates make.</p>
            <p>They proclaim their folly; for all <note place="margin">1.</note> their former violence for Heaven is
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56017:66"/>
lost. He who runs half the Race, and then faints, loseth the Garland, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 24. <hi>When the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, all his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned.</hi> All mens prayers and tears are lost. The Apostate unravels all that he hath been doing. He is like a man that with a pensil draws a curious picture, and then comes with his spunge and wipes it out again, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>Have ye suffered so many things in vain?</hi> Perhaps, for Religion a man hath suffered many a reproach and affront; and have ye suffered all this in vain? Here is folly indeed.</p>

A talent of gold among the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> was valued at almost four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds. Ten thousand talents is a figurative speech, to express how great a debt sin is; and do you call this a pleasure? is it any pleasure for a man to be in debt?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Scripture calls sin a <hi>disease, Isa.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>The whole head is sick.</hi> Is it any pleasure to be sick? Though all do not feel this sickness, yet the less the distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is felt, the moremorta.</p>

in the Gospel, when he was speaking of his store of goods, and his barns being full, <hi>Soul, take thine ease, Luke</hi> 12. 19. He might have said more properly, <hi>Body take thine ease;</hi> for his soul was never the better for his riches, nor could it feel any delight in them. Though his barns were full, his soul was empty. Therefore when Satan tells thee, If thou usest violence for Heaven, thou wilt lose all thy pleasures: ask him, what pleasures are they Satan? such as please only the <hi>senses,</hi> they do not delight the mind; they do not comfort the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; they are such delights wherein the bruit creatures do exceed me.</p>

Having answered these Objections, let me re-assume the exhortation, pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing all Christians to this violence for the heavenly Kingdom. As <hi>David</hi>'s three Worthies ventured their lives, and brake thorow the hoast of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listims</hi> for water, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 16. Such a kind of violence must we use, breaking through all dangers for obtaining the <hi>Water of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Consider the deplorable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Motive. 1.</note> we are in by nature; a state of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery and damnation; therefore what violence should we use to get out of it! Were one plunged into quick-sands, would he not use violence to get out? Sin is a quicksand, and is it not wisdom to extricate our selves out? <hi>David</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing encompassed with enemies, said, <hi>His soul was among Lions, Psal.</hi> 57. 4. 'Tis true in a spiritual sense, our soul is among Lions. Every sin is a Lion that would devour us, and if we are in the Lion's Den, shall we not use violence to get out? The Angels used violence to <hi>Lot;</hi> they laid hold on him, and pulled him out of <hi>Sodom, Gen.</hi> 19. 16. Such violence must be used to get out of the spiritual <hi>Sodom.</hi> It is no safety to

            <p n="2">2. It is possible that in the use of <note place="margin">Motive. 2.</note> means we may arrive at happiness. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility destroies endeavour: but here is a <hi>door of hope</hi> opened. The thing is feasible. It is not with us as with the damned in Hell; there is a tomb-stone rolled over them. But while we are under the sound of <hi>Aaron's Bell,</hi> and the Silver Trumpet of the Gospel is blown in our ears, while the Spirit of Grace breaths on us, and we are on this side the grave; there is great hope that by holy violence we may win Paradise. An absolute impossibility of salvation is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for them who have sinned the sin against the Holy Ghost, and cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, but who these are is a secret seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in God's Book: else here is a great encouragement to all to be serious and earnest in the matters of eternity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are yet in a capacity of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, no final sentence is already passed; God hath not yet taken up the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge of mercy. Though the gate of Paradise is <hi>strait,</hi> yet it is not shut. This should be as Oyl to the wheels, to make us lively and active in the business of salvation.

Should the body only be tended, this were to trim the scabbard, and let the blade rust: to preserve the lumber, and let the child be burnt. God sends us into the world as a Merchant sends his Factor to trade for him beyond the Seas. So God sends us hither to follow a spiritual trade, to serve him and save our souls. If we spend all our time <hi>aut aliud agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, aut nihil,</hi> in dressing and pampering our bodies, or idle visits, we shall give but a sad account to God, when he shall send us a letter of summons by death,

A Christian may think thus, what should I take pains? perhaps I am not elected, and then all my vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is to no purpose. Thus, many are taken off from the use of means, and the business of Religion is at a stand. Whereas no man can justly say, he is not elected. It is true, some of God's chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have said so in temptation: But as <hi>Peter</hi> in a <hi>transfiguration</hi> said he knew not what; so these in a temptation.

Many are violent for the Kingdom of God, till gain or preferment offers it self; when they meet with this hony, then they stand still. The world blinds mens eyes that they do not see the way; and fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters their feet that they do not run in the way of God's Commandments. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi> King of <hi>Pontus</hi> being worsted by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and fearing he should not escape them, caused a great deal of silver and gold to be scattered in the waies, which while the <hi>Roman</hi> souldiers were busie in gathering, he got away from them.

The world's mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick charms men asleep, and when they are asleep, they are not fit to work. A thing cannot be carried violently to two extreams at once. The ship cannot go full sail to the East and West at the sametime: So a man cannot be violent for Heaven and Earth at once: he may have Christ and the world, but cannot love Christ and the world, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 15.

            <p>Take heed of indulging any lust. Sin <note place="margin">4.</note> lived in will spoil all violence for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Sin infeebles; 'tis like the cutting <hi>Sampson</hi>'s hair, and then the strength departs. Sin is <hi>aegritudo animi,</hi> the soul's sickness. Sickness takes a man off his

The more live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the heart is in sin, the more dead it is in prayer. How can he be earnest with God for mercy, whose heart ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseth him of secret sin. Guilt breeds fear; and that which strengthens fear, weakens violence. <hi>Adam</hi> having sinned was afraid, and hid himself, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 10.

Many will leave ail their sins but one; save one sin, and lose one soul. One sin is a fetter; a man may lose the Race as well by having one fetter on his leg, as if he had more. I have read of a great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naroh<note n="*" place="margin">Dar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Why art thou disquieted within me? hope yet in God.</hi> A sad heart makes a dull action. We use the Drum and Trumpet in Battel, that the noise of the Trumpet may excite and quicken the souldiers spirits, and make them fight more vigorously. Chearfulness is like musick in battel, it excites a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian's spirits, and makes him vegete and lively in duty.
