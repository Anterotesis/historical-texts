         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Worſhipful Doctor,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AFter thoſe Reſpects due to you, this is humbly to entreat you with patience to
read and conſider this following Narrative of matters between you and my
ſelf, in which I have been careful to give a true Account, without any bad
Language, or any bitter Reflections, which are too common in matters of
this kind: My only deſign in this is to diſcover past Proceedings, as well on my own
part as on yours; that ſo ſuch as may hereafter be concerned with <hi>Eccleſiaſtical
Courts,</hi> as I have been with yours, may by theſe Proceedings learn either to forbear to
do as I have done, or elſe improve the ſame to do better, or find out ſome other way
more for their own Advantage.</p>
            <p>And for as much as your Worſhip hath loaded a Multitude of his Majeſties Proteſtant
Subjects with Admonitions and Excommunications (and with the Writ <hi>de Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municato
Capiendo)</hi> to force them into a Jail, if they do not pay you great Sums of
money for not obeying your Admonitions:</p>
            <p>I beſeech you to receive a few Proteſtant Admonitions agreeable to the Holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I.</hi> That you being a Doctor and Judge of a Court called Spiritual, it highly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
you to ſee that you are a true Spiritual man, not walking according to the Luſts of
the Fleſh: Spiritual perſons ought to maintain Spiritual practices, <hi>Rom. 8. 1.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>II.</hi> Take heed that you do not force any Perſons by your Admonition to come
unto the holy Communion, who are unholy in their Converſation; and that they may
eſcape your Excommunication, Venture to Eat and Drink their own Damnation.
<hi>1 Cor. 11. 20.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>III.</hi> Take heed you do not force the Godly to partake with the Vngodly, leaſt you make
them Partakers of other mens Sins; but purge out the Old Leaven that you may be
a new Lump; <hi>for a little Leaven leaveneth the whole Lump,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IV.</hi> Take heed you do not that to others, which you would not have them do to you,
<hi>viz.</hi> You would not be willing the Protestant Diſſenters (conſidered as Independents,
Preſbyterians, or thoſe falſly called Anabaptiſts) ſhould compel you to take the Holy
Sacrament amongst any of them, <hi>Mat. 5. 12.</hi> Therefore why ſhould you do the like?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>V.</hi> Take heed that you do not force Perſons to the holy Sacrament against their
Wills, ſeeing God must be ſerved with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind,
<hi>1 Chron. 28. 9.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>VI.</hi> Take heed you 'do not force Perſons to the Holy Sacrament, who have not a
right unto it; or ſuch as for fear of your further Proceedings may come unto it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their own Conſciences, of whom it may be ſaid as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Corinthian</hi>
Profeſſors, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 20. This is not to eat the Lords Supper; for the abuſing of Gods
Ordinance is a loſing Gods Ordinance, to the Abuſers of it, and it may be ſaid, Such
eat mans Dinner, rather then the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>VII.</hi> Take heed that whilſt you proceed in handling Perſons about Spiritual things,
that you let your Proceedings be according to Spiritual Rules contained in the Holy
Scriptures, in which there is no Directions to inflict outward Penalties upon Perſons
for not performing of Spiritual Duties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>VIII.</hi> Take heed that you do not debaſe Religion in making Spiritual matters bow
and Truckle unto Temporal matters, for baſe ends; and let not the Holy Sacrament
be made a Qualification for keeping an Alehouſe, or for being Electors of Magiſtrates;
it is enough that men be Free-holders in the Country, or free-men and of the Livery
in the City for ſuch things.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:53929:3"/>
               <hi>IX.</hi> Take into your Conſideration the many miſeries that now attend a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of his Majeſties good Subjects, ſome conſtrained to be as Priſoners, in their own
Houſes, others fled into the Countrey, others let their Houſes, and put off their Trades,
and others remove from thoſe Pariſhes where they were proſecuted, in hopes to be more
quiet elſewhere, and ſome are carried to Priſon; and all by reaſon of your Proceedings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>X.</hi> Take heed that the Sighs and Cries of poor Women and Children, (who groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this Diſtreſs) do not go up to the God of Compaſſion, and be returned againſt you as
the Cauſe of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XI.</hi> Do not think it will be enough for you to ſay you have proceeded according to Law,
(if you could prove that) but conſider that the Eccleſiaſtical Doctors, and ſuch as were
called Spiritual Judges in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days, had the ſame Plea for their Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
the poor Protestants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XII.</hi> I Beſeech you conſider that the Non-Compliance of Protestant-Diſſenters, in
matters of Religion, as impoſed by you, is not for want of Loyalty to his Majesty, but
for fear they ſhould corrupt Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>And now worthy Sir, be not afraid to put your ſelf upon a Tryal by this Christian
Jury of Sober Admonitions, which are humbly and honestly Impannelled by</p>

            <p>ANd now Doctor, becauſe worthy Examples and good Patterns are ſometimes more Prevalent

Doctor of Law, belonging to the Eccleſiaſtical Court in the famous City of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who when the Diſſenters and Non-Conformiſts of that day, were cited and brought before the
ſaid Eccleſiaſtical Court, and by the Authority thereof were decreed to be Excommunicated out of
the Church, and out of the World alſo;</p>
            <p>The aforeſaid Doctor of Law favoured and defended the Cauſe of thoſe poor Diſſenters, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
an excellent ſpeech againſt the violent Proceedings of that Court; which take as followeth, as
it is Recorded, not in Acts of Parliament, but in the Acts of the Apoſtles, <hi>Chapter 5.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vers. 34.</hi> Then there ſtood up one in the Counſel, a Phariſee, named <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> a Doctor of Law
had in Reputation of all the People, and commanded to put the Apoſtles forth a little ſpace.</p>
            <p>

do as touching theſe men.</p>
            <p>

            <p>From this Citation the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> doth obſerve theſe following things, and
deſireth others to conſider and well improve them.</p>
            <p>1. That this Citation is not in the Kings Name, (only, <hi>I Cite you.</hi>)</p>
            <p>2. Though there is Mention made of a Proceſs under Seal, by vertue of
which the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> was Cited, it is not ſaid, <hi>By vertue of a Commiſſion from his
Majeſty,</hi> given to Impower that Court ſo to proceed.</p>
            <p>3. Though there is mention made of <hi>Law and Justice</hi> in the ſaid Citation, that
is no Demonſtration of the Legallity of the aforeſaid Court; and how much of
<hi>Law and Justice</hi> hath been managed there, let thoſe Judge that have been
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53929:4"/>
handled in the ſaid Court, and what may yet be expected of Law and Juſtice
muſt be very patiently waited for, by thoſe that ſuffer.</p>
            <p>The next day, being the <hi>17th</hi> day of <hi>November</hi> aforeſaid, the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> with
others of his Proteſtant Neighbours, did appear before the ſaid Doctor <hi>Pinfold,</hi>
thinking thereby to avoid a ſtrange thing called <hi>Cotumacy</hi> or <hi>Contempt</hi> in that
Court; Suppoſing he ſhould have had further Citations, before any further
Proceedings; but he found himſelf greatly miſtaken, for the ſaid Doctor was
very nimble with the honeſt Neighbours of the ſaid <hi>Jones,</hi> as they were parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
called by their Names, and preſently concluded them Guilty of the
matters in the Church-Wardens Preſentment, <hi>viz.</hi> of not coming to Church,
and not Receiving the Sacrament, without Poſitive Proof, of thoſe matters by
Perſons appearing Face to Face; though the Truth is, the ſaid Doctor did not
put any of thoſe before him to accuſe themſelves, but did preſently proceed to
Admoniſh them, <hi>To come to Church, and to take the Sacrament in their own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
Church, and bring a Certificate, they had ſo done from the Doctor of the ſaid
Pariſh, by the 6th day of December following.</hi> And when moſt of the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi>'s
Neighbours had been called, the Clark called for one Mr. <hi>Jones;</hi> The ſaid
<hi>Jones</hi> Replyed, <hi>His Name was</hi> Jones, <hi>and he was come to ſee whether he was the man
intended in the Preſentment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctor concluded that, (becauſe the Citation was left at his houſe:)
<hi>Jones</hi> confeſſed there was a Citation left at his houſe, but that was no Proof that
he was the ſame Perſon intended; Eſpecially conſidering that his <hi>Whole Name</hi>
was not in the Citation, only Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> and there might be other <hi>Jones's</hi> in the
ſaid Pariſh.</p>
            <p>Then the Doctor inquired of the Apparitor, who ſaid that one of the Church-Wardens
did direct him to the houſe of the ſaid <hi>Jones,</hi> where he left the Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſaid he was the ſame <hi>Jones</hi> in the Preſentment.</p>
            <p>Jones <hi>then told the Doctor,</hi> That if he were the Perſon, he would not needleſly
contend; but however he thought the Citation was not legally ſerved, it being not
given into his own hand, neither had he ſeen the Seal of the Court mentioned in
the Citation.</p>
            <p>To which Doctor <hi>Pinfold</hi> Replying, Allowed that it was not a Legal Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and that if the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> had not then appeared, the Court would have
ſworn their Officer, who if upon Oath he had ſaid he could not find the ſaid
<hi>Jones,</hi> then they would have ſet up a <hi>Viis &amp; Modis</hi> upon the Church door, or
upon his own door, requiring him to appear in the Eccleſiaſtical Court, but
being the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> did appear, the Citation was at an end, and there was no
need of any more Citations.</p>
            <p>Then the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> perceived that he was got into a Trap, by being ſo ready
to go with his honeſt Neighbours to that Court, upon a Suppoſition that the
Citation being not ſerved upon his Perſon, nor his full Name in, the Citation
was not right, and therefore thought he ſhould have had a Diſmiſſion for that
time till a new Citation was ſent and ſerved upon him; he very well knowing
that the Eccleſiaſtical Courts did formerly proceed very ſlowly; but it ſeems
Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>'s day was near at hand, for the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> to chooſe a
<hi>New Common Conncil,</hi> and it was high time to haſten Excommunications,
thereby if it were poſſible, to prevent the Priviledge of ſuch Perſons in their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of that Honourable Court of Common Council; but this is a happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to the Loyal City of <hi>London,</hi> that the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> do underſtand
the Statute Law, by which the Kings Power and the Peoples Priviledge is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
though they may not ſo well underſtand the Roaring Cannons of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53929:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Courts, <hi>viz.</hi> The Canon Law; and now the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> doth hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
deſire his fellow Proteſtants to bear with this Digreſſion, and not count it
a Tranſgreſſion; but he thinks it adviſible that ſuch as are not cited with a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
upon their own Perſons, need not make ſo much haſte to the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Courts as to break their Shins. And ſo the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> will return to his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Diſcourſe with Doctor <hi>Pinfold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the ſaid Doctor ſoberly proceeded, telling the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> that he was
under the ſame Circumſtances with his Neighbours, viz. <hi>Preſented by the
Church-Wardens, for not coming to his Pariſh Church, and for not receiving the
Sacrament;</hi> and added, <hi>I think it in vain to ask when you were at Church, but I
will hear what you have to ſay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then the ſaid</hi> Jones <hi>Replyed,</hi> Doctor, I perceive you will deal with me as with
my Neighbours, preſently proceed to an Admonition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Doctor ſaid,</hi> You may be ſure of that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jones</hi> replied, Sir, I deſire you to hear me a few words, before you proceed
to Admonition; for I am not come to Provoke you, and I hope you will not
Oppreſs me.</p>
            <p>Then the Doctor conſented to hear what <hi>Jones</hi> had to ſay.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jones.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I am ready to receive and comply with an Admonition to receive
the Sacrament, provided you will give me ſuch an Admonition, and in ſuch a
Spirit as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> gave in his days, (at this word the Doctor looked
ſomewhat ſtrangely, as if <hi>Pauls</hi> Admonitions were ſtrange things in that
Court; but <hi>Jones</hi> went on, ſaying that) <hi>Paul</hi> did Admoniſh Perſons to examine
themſelves and come to that Ordinance, and in another place, <hi>Paul</hi> did Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
Perſons to take heed they did not partake with Whore-mongers, and
Drunkards, and Railers; in the firſt Admonition, Perſons are taught to look
after their <hi>Own Fitneſs;</hi> and in the other Admonition Perſons are taught to
take heed of the <hi>Vnfitneſs of others,</hi> and ſuch an Admonition I am willing to
Receive.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doctor.</speaker>
               <p>You are a very Uncharitable man; what do you Judge your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to be Whore-mongers?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jones.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I do but ſpeak what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid a great while ago, which is Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to us now; and though I will not ſay, my Neighbours are Whore-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
yet this I will ſay, and Appeal to your Conſcience, that there is ſome
Perſons mentioned in one of thoſe Scriptures, in moſt, if not in all the Pariſhes
of <hi>London,</hi> viz. <hi>Drunkards,</hi> and <hi>Railers,</hi> and I may add, <hi>Dreadful Swearers,</hi> and
ſuch as call upon God to damn them; for Wickedneſs is grown bold in all our
Streets.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doctor.</speaker>
               <p>Sir you muſt look to your own ſelf.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jones.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, that I learn from the firſt Admonition of <hi>Paul;</hi> and muſt take heed
I do not communicate with wicked perſons, from the other Admonition of <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doctor.</speaker>
               <p>I Admoniſh, I Admoniſh you to come to Church, and to take the
Sacrament in your own Pariſh-Church, between this and the 6th day of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi>
next, and bring a Certificate from the Doctor of your Pariſh, that you
have ſo done.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jones.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, ſeeing you have proceeded to Admoniſh me, I pray tell me whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you Admoniſh me as a Miniſter, or as a Magiſtrate?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doctor.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Jones.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, then I ſuppoſe you have the Kings Commiſſion for your thus pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doctor.</speaker>
               <p>What Sir! Do you call the Authority of this Court into Queſtion?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:53929:5"/>
               <speaker>Jones.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I rather conclude it; if you be a Magiſtrate, then you muſt have a
Commiſſion for what you do, and I deſire to ſee it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doctor.</speaker>
               <p>Now I ſee what you are, if you had Opportunity you would queſtion
the Kings Authority or Title to the Kingdom.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jones.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, that is unworthily ſpoken of you, and though you be a greater
man than I am, I cannot bear this, it is Unſufferable, and you cannot anſwer
this thing. Sir do you ſit here as a Judge of a Court; and Inſinuate ſo baſe an
Accuſation againſt any of his Majeſties Leige People? I would have you to
know, and I do here declare, that I do own the Kings Authority, as King of
this Realm; and if you have the Kings Commiſſion for this Court, ſhow it
me, and I will own the Kings Authority in you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doctor.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I will not ſhow it you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jones.</speaker>
               <p>I have humbly deſired it, but now I demand you to ſhow me the
Kings Commiſſion for your keeping this Court, for I deſire to Reverence the
Kings Authority wherever I ſee it, and I will Reverence you as the Kings
Commiſſioner, if you ſhow your Commiſſion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doctor.</speaker>
               <p>I do not uſe to carry it in my my Pocket, I will not ſhew it you.
Clark go on.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jones.</speaker>
               <p>Well Sir, then I demand a Copy of my Libel, and time to plead to it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doctor</speaker>
               <p>I cannot deny you a Copy, you may have it at the Regiſters Office.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jones.</speaker>
               <p>Sir I demand time to plead to it when I have it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doctor.</speaker>
               <p>Sir I will not give you time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jones.</speaker>
               <p>What Sir, will you choak me with the Sacrament? I do own and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
the Sacrament as a holy thing, and an Ordinance of God, but you
ought not to force it down my Throat after this manner at your Pleaſure;
this is not the way to bring People to a Right Conformity to the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> that ſhould be done by good Arguments and gentle Reaſoning.</p>
               <stage>Then the Doctor bid the Clark go on, and call another Perſon, ſaying,</stage>
               <p>
                  <hi>I have had talk enough with this man.</hi> 
                  <stage>And another being called, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor

                  <stage>
                     <hi>Jones</hi> then ſpake to the Doctor again; ſaying,</stage> Doctor, I beſeech you let

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doctor.</speaker>
               <p>Why I was not angry.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jones.</speaker>
               <p>Truly Sir, you ſeemed to be angry juſt now, however I do now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doctor.</speaker>
               <p>Speak on, what is it?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Jones.</speaker>
               <p>Sir I intreat you to tell me the worſt of this matter, what will be my
danger if through ignorance, or neglect, or any thing elſe, I ſhould not take the
Sacrament at the time appointed by you?</p>
            </sp>
            <stage>A Gentleman ſtanding by the Doctor, anſwered, <hi>You must go and ask your

            </stage>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jones.</speaker>
               <p>What need that Sir, ſeeing I am before the Judge of this Court who
can tell me all the Proceedings of his own Court? And therefore Doctor, I pray
tell me, that I may not be an ignorant Offender, nor an ignorant Sufferer, an
Obſtinate one I will not be.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doctor.</speaker>
               <p>Then I will tell you, If you do not come to Church and take the
Sacrament by the time appointed, you will be Excommunicated, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
laid up in a Jail.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jones.</speaker>
               <p>But pray Doctor, is there any ſuch Law of God in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
concerning the Sacrament, to lay up People in Jail for not taking of it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <speaker>Doctor.</speaker>
               <p>I have done with you. And ſo bid the Clark go on, and call ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
elſe. And thus the matter ended for that day.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Now the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> further ſaith, That he could not ſee any marks of Honour
or Power belonging to a Court held by the Kings Commiſſion, for he could
not ſee the Kings Arms in the ſaid Tabernacle; and whether the former Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
were Pertinent or Impertinent, is ſubmitted to the Conſideration and
cenſure of all ſober Perſons when they have well conſidered of the Statute of
the 1ſt. of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th. <hi>Chap. 2.</hi> which take as followeth,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ANd whereas the Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops, and other Spiritual
Perſons in this Realm do uſe to make and ſend out their Summons
Citations, and other Proceſſes, in their own names, and in ſuch Form
and manner as was uſed in the time of the Vſurped Power of the Biſhop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> contrary to the Form and Order of the Summons and Proceſs
of the Common-Law uſed in this Realm, ſeeing that all Authority of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
Spiritual and Temporal is derived and deducted from the Kings
Majeſty as Supream Head of theſe Churches and Realms of <hi>England,</hi>
and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and ſo, juſtly acknowledged by the Clergy of the ſaid Realms)
That all Courts Eccleſiaſtical within the ſaid two Realms be kept by
no other Power or Authority, either Forreign or within the Realm, but
by the Authority of his moſt excellent Majeſty, Be it therefore further
Enacted, by the Authority aforeſaid, that all Summons and Citations,
or other Proceſs Eccleſiaſtical in all Suits and Cauſes of inſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
party and party, and all Cauſes of correction, and all Cauſes of
Baſterdy or Bigamy, or Inquiry <hi>de Jure Patronatus,</hi> Probates of Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and Commiſſions of Adminiſtrations of Perſons deceaſed, and
all Acquittances of, and upon Accounts made by the Executors, Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrators
or Collectors of goods of any dead Perſon, be from the firſt day
of <hi>July</hi> next Following made in the Name and with the Style of the
King as it is in Writs Original, or Iudicial, at the Common Law, and
that the <hi>Teſte</hi> thereof be in the Name of the Arch-biſhop or biſhop, or other,
having Eccleſiaſtical Iuriſdiction, who have the commiſſion and Grant
of the Authority Eccleſiaſtical, immediately from the Kings Highneſs, and
that his Commiſſary, Official, or Subſtitute, Exerciſing Iuriſdiction under
him ſhall put his name in the Citation or Proceſs after the <hi>Teſte.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Furthermore be it Enacted by the Authority aforeſaid, that all manner
of perſon or perſons who have the Exerciſe of Eccleſiaſtical Iuriſdiction,
ſhall have from the firſt day of <hi>July</hi> before expreſſed in their Seals of Office
the Kings Highneſſes Arms decently ſet with certain Characters under the
Arms for the Knowledge of the Dioceſs, and ſhall uſe no other Seal of
Iuriſdiction but wherein his Majeſties Arms be ingraven, upon pain that
if any perſon ſhall uſe Eccleſiaſtical Iuriſdiction (after the day expreſſed)
in this Realm of <hi>England, Wales,</hi> or other his Dominions or Territories,
and not ſend or make out the Citation or Proceſs in the Kings Name, or
uſe any Seal of Iuri ſdiction other then before Limited, that every ſuch Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
ſhall incur and run in the Kings Majeſties Diſpleaſure and Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſuffer Impriſonment at his Highneſſes Will and Pleaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now whether the Eccleſiaſtical Courts have ſuch Authority from the Kings
Majeſty by Commiſſion under the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> and do proceed in the
Exerciſe thereof, according to the recited Statute of the 1 <hi>Edw. 6.</hi> the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi>
doth humbly leave it with Doctor <hi>Pinfold</hi> to give a Satisfactory Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of it.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53929:6"/>
However the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> hath yet no cauſe to conclude that the Eccleſiaſtical
Courts have ſuch Power, or have ſo Legally Proceeded with him, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Perſons, firſt, becauſe the firſt ſtep of Proceeding, <hi>viz.</hi> the Citation, was
not in the Kings Name.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe Doctor <hi>Pinfold</hi> refuſed to ſhow the Kings Commiſſion
when humbly deſired, and honeſtly demanded in the place where he held his
Court, which if the ſaid Doctor had been impowered according to the former
Statute, it had been very eaſy for him to have given ſome convincing Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
thereof, and then the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> would have ſo declared the matter to
others of his fellow Proteſtants, as might have prevented many People from
finding fault with the ſaid Court, and have cauſed them to give the more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
and Reſpect becauſe of his Majeſties Authority according to Law.</p>
            <p>But it may be ſome will ſay, that the aforeſaid Statute of 1 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. 2. hath
been Repealed. The ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> doth grant that to be true, but then let it be well
conſidered by whom it was Repealed, and that was by Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> a ſhee-Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Succeſſor, an Enemy to the Proteſtent Religion, and to Proteſtants of all
ſorts, who made a change in Eccleſiaſtical Courts, as well as in other Courts,
Popiſh Perſons being made Judges, Officials, and Surrogates to manage Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Affairs, according to the Popiſh way, and then were the poor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
the Diſſenters of that time, and were handled accordingly, being Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Eccleſiaſtical Courts, and Excommunicated, and then delivered up
to the Temporal Power for Impriſonment and death alſo, becauſe they were
the Non-Conformiſts of that day, and did not in all things ſubmit themſelves
to the Government as Eſtabliſhed by Law; though they had the holy word
and Law of God on their ſides. This may teach all Perſons to take heed of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
too much upon National Laws, in matters of Religion, becauſe they who
are the Conformiſts in one Kings Raign, may be the Non-Conformiſts in his
Succeſſors Raign; and they would not think it a ſufficient Argument againſt
them, that their Opinions and Practices are contrary to the Government Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
by Law: But whether the men of <hi>Doctors-Commons</hi> may not believe
that a change of Religion Eſtabliſhed by Law, is not a ſufficient Argument to
keep their places, and plead Conformity, ſhall be left for time to manifeſt.</p>
            <p>And now the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> will return to the Repeal of the former Statute, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no
Primo Mariae Seſſio Secunda chap. 2.</hi> A Repeal was made of the Statute of the
firſt of <hi>Edw. 6. 2.</hi> called an Act for the Election of Biſhops which is the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
Statute.</p>
            <p>But then it muſt be again conſidered, the Statute of Repeal of 1 <hi>Mary</hi> 2. was
repealed by King <hi>James;</hi> ſee <hi>Anno 1 Jacobi Regis Chap. 25.</hi> in theſe very words.
<hi>And be it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

an Act made in the firſt year of the Reign of Queen</hi> Mary, Entituled, An Act for
the Repeal of certain Statutes made in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, <hi>ſhall
ſtand Repealed and Void.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that now it is Evident that Queen <hi>Maries</hi> repealing Statute being repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and made void by King <hi>James,</hi> thoſe Statutes of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, are
now in full force, they being left in the ſame Life and Strength as when they
were firſt made, unleſs it can be proved that a Repeal of them hath been made
ſince the Statute of 1 <hi>Jacobi Chap.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p>And ſo the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> will return to give a further Account of his owne Caſe
and further ſaith, that between the time of the Admonition, and the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

ſuch as were learned in the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and had a Plea in Law, prepared

            <p>And as touching the aforeſaid Preſentment, the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> doth verily believe
that the Church-wardens did not do it as an Act of Envy or ill will to their
Neighbours, for as much as the names of the before mentioned Pariſhoners were
carried to <hi>Doctors-Commons</hi> by ſome body elſe, and then the Church-Wardens
were ſent for to <hi>Doctors-Commons,</hi> and required to put them into a Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the ſaid Church-wardens did then forbear to do ſo, but about a week
after they did it, at the importunity of ſome perſon at <hi>Doctors-Commons.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> cannot but take notice, that the Church-wardens were very
ſparing of their words, in the Preſentment, there is no harſh Expreſſions againſt
any of their Neighbours, neither have they made it a Poſitive charge, thereby
demonſtrating they were men cautious of what they did in matters of Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
but it ſeems any ſmall hint at things of an Accuſing nature, may ſerve
as a Foundation of the Proceedings of that Court.</p>
            <p>And the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> further ſaith, that if the aforeſaid Church-wardens had not
conſented to make this Preſentment, they could not have been puniſhed by that
Court: And ſeeing the names were carried into Court by ſome other perſon,
they might have left him to be Proſecutor who was ſo forward to turn Informer.</p>
            <p>But this matter being done, it cannot be now undone, and poor <hi>Jones</hi> doth
yet hope he ſhall not be quite undone by it.</p>
            <p>And for the Benefit and help of Church-wardens, who are required by the
Eccleſiaſtical Courts to take an Oath, to make Preſentments of Crimes and
Ofences, let the Statute of <hi>Anno Decimo Sexto Caroli Prim. Chap. 11. Paragr.</hi>
4. be well conſidered, that ſo they may not be Impoſed upon in ſuch matters.
The words of the Statute are as followeth,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And be it alſo Enacted by the Authority aforeſaid, that no Arch-biſhop, Biſhop,

or Wager of Law, ſhall be admitted or Allowed, to the Defendant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it will be objected by ſome that this Statute is repealed; unto which it
is anſwered, by the ſaid <hi>Jones,</hi> that the firſt part of the afore-recited Statute is
repealed; but the ſecond part, <hi>viz,</hi> that in which mention is made, of impoſing
the Oath <hi>Ex-Officio</hi> or any other Oath to the damage of any of the Kings Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
is repeated and Confirmed by the Statute of <hi>Decimo tertio-Caroli Secundi.

               </gap> the before recited Statute.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <hi>Provided always,</hi> That this Act or any thing therein contained, ſhall not extend
or be conſtrued to Extend, to give unto any Arch-biſhop, Biſhop, or any other

any power or Authority to Exerciſe, Execute, Inflict, or Determine any Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Iuriſdiction, Cenſure or Coertion, which they might not by Law have
done before, the year of our Lord 1639. nor to Abridge or Diminiſh the Kings
Majeſties Supremacy, in Eccleſiaſtical Matters and Affairs, not to confirm the
Canons in the year 1640. nor any of them, nor any other, Eccleſiaſtical Laws or
canons not formerly confirmed, Allowed, or Enacted by parliament, or by the
Eſtabliſhed Laws of the Land, as they ſtood in the year of our Lord <hi>1639.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>From which two Statutes theſe things are to be Conſidered:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz. Chap. 1. Sect.</hi> 18. by which ſome Power and
Authority extraordinary, was Exerciſed by Eccleſiaſtical Perſons to the great
wrong and damage of his Majeſties Subjects, is repealed and made void by
<hi>Car. 1.</hi> and <hi>Car. 2.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:53929:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
2. That though the Repealing Statute of <hi>Car. I.</hi> chap. 11. be Repealed by 13th
<hi>Car. II.</hi> chap. 12. yet the Eccleſiaſtical Party have thereby no power or Authority
given or left unto them, but ſuch ordinary power as they had before the making the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed
Statute.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Impoſing of Oaths by Eccleſiaſtical perſons to the damage of any of
His Majeſties Subjects is plainly forbiden by the Statutes of 16 <hi>Car. I.</hi> chap. 11.
and 13 <hi>Car. II.</hi> chap. 12</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the Eccleſiaſtical Party have not any power to proceed againſt any of His
Majeſties Subjects, or to make or confirm any Cannon or Eccleſiaſtical Laws, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
then was Allowed and Confirmed to them by Acts of Parliament, and the Eſtabliſhed
Laws of the Land, as they ſtood in the Year 1639. and how much or how little that was,
ſhall be left to further Search.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ſince the making of the aforeſaid Statute of</hi> 13 Car. II. viz. <hi>in the 27th year
of his Majeſties Reign, one</hi> Thomas Watersfeild, <hi>Church-Warden of the Pariſh of</hi> Arundel, <hi>in
the County of</hi> Suſſex, <hi>was Impoſed upon by the Biſhop of</hi> Chichester, to take an Oath, That
be ſhould with his utmoſt dilligence, Preſent every perſon, which then or lately was inhabiting
within the ſaid Pariſh of <hi>Arundel,</hi> who hath done any Offence, or neglected any Duty, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in certain Articles, contained in a certain printed Book: In which book, amongſt other
things, there was contained this Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether every perſon inhabiting, or ſojourning
within the Pariſh of <hi>Arundel</hi> aforeſaid, did daily reſort every Lords day and Festival daies
Appointed for Divine Service, to the Church? And whether they did there remain the whole
time of Divine Service, quietly, with Reverence, order and decency?</p>
            <p>Which Oath the ſaid Church-Warden did refuſe to take, and for it was afterward
Excommunicated by the ſaid Biſhop. But the ſaid <hi>Watersfeild</hi> brought his Caſe before His
Majeſties Judges of the Court of <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> who relieved and releaſed him by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition;
in which and wherein it is plainly Declared on the behalf of the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
as followeth <hi>viz. That by the Laws of this our Realm of England, no perſon ought
to be cited to appear in any Court Chriſtian; before any Judge Spiritual, to take any Oath, unleſs
it be only in Caſes Matrimonial or Teſtamentary.</hi> And the aforeſaid Biſhop is in the ſaid
Prohibition Charged with Breach of the aforeſaid Statute of 13 <hi>Car. II.</hi> and of the
Common Law of this Realm, and therefore was required to Releaſe and diſſolve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
and Sentences againſt the ſaid <hi>Thomas Watersfeild.</hi> And for your further ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
pray go and look the Prohibition. But to teturn to our Narrative.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> further ſaith, That upon the Sixth day of <hi>December,</hi> inſtead of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
a Certificate of his taking the Sacrament, he carried his Plea in Law, to Doctor
<hi>Pinfold</hi>'s Court, then held in the Tabernacle, in <hi>Old-Fiſh-ſtreet, London;</hi> and took wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
with him, and preſented his Plea to the Doctor; but he refuſed to take it, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he would go thorrow what he was then upon. The ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> bid the Doctor take
notice he was there and he would wait; which he did above an hour, till the Doctor
ſpoke of Adjourning the Court.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Jones</hi> ſpoke to the Doctor as followeth, Doctor, this Paper is a Plea in Law
againſt the Preſentment of the Church-Wardens: I deſire you to receive it, and of
Right demand you to Record it in your Court Book, and Doctor I pray do not take
what I am now going to ſay to you as an Angry word proceeding from my own breaſt,
but I am Adviſed to ſay: Excommunicate me at your peril; this is my Plea, and I will
ſtand by it. Then the Doctor ſaid, Leave it; and <hi>Jones</hi> ſaid, Record it: this was ſpoken
ſeveral times over by each; at which Inſtant ſomebody pulled off a Gentlemans Hat;
and ſome buſle was like to be in the Court: and <hi>Jones</hi> deſired the Doctor to Record
his Plea, and he would be gone, and not be concerned with any Tumult. The Doctor
ſaid, Leave it, and I will preſently Adjourn the Court; which was done accordingly.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <head>A Copy of the forementioned Plea, is as followeth.</head>
                  <p>The Anſwer of <hi>James Jones</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> to the pretended Charge or Preſentment o
<hi>Geroge Cole</hi> and <hi>William Barron,</hi> Church-Wardens of the Pariſh of St. <hi>Bartholomew Exchange:</hi>
Exhibited on the Fourteenth day of <hi>November</hi> laſt; before the Worſhipful-<hi>Thomas

                  </p>
                  <p>1. THE ſaid <hi>James Jones</hi> alwaies reſerving to himſelf, and praying the liberty of a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and more full Anſwer, and in more due form of Law, and the benefit of all Legal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
to the ſaid Charge or Preſentment, ſaith, that he the ſaid <hi>James Jones</hi> cannot determin
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53929:8"/>
the bounds of Dioceſſes and Pariſhes; and therefore whether he the ſaid <hi>James Jones</hi> be,
and during the time in the ſaid pretended Preſentment, was an Inhabitant within the ſaid Pariſh;
but referreth himſelf to the due proof thereof according to Law.</p>
                  <p>2. The ſaid <hi>James Jones</hi> ſaith, he is credibly informed, and hopes to prove the ſame; that
the ſaid Church-Wardens ſometime ſince their being in that Office, and before the pretended Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment,
did upon their Oaths Return into the Court <hi>Omnia bene, &amp;c.</hi> or did not Charge the ſaid
<hi>James Jones</hi> with any Offence, and therefore, if he the ſaid <hi>James Jones,</hi> were an Inhabitant
within the ſaid Pariſh, (as the pretended Preſentment ſuppoſes) he the ſaid <hi>James Jones</hi> ought
to be ſuppoſed innocent, and free from any fault. And for the time of ſuch their first Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he the ſaid <hi>James Jones</hi> referreth himſelf, and demands the ſight and proof thereof.</p>
                  <p>3. The ſaid <hi>James Jones</hi> ſaith, That the now pretended Preſentment, againſt this Reſpondent,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not ſufficient in the Law; it being not poſitive, but doubtful and uncertain, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
he the ſaid <hi>James Jones,</hi> ought not to Anſwer thereunto, or to receive any admonition upon
ſuch an Illegal Preſentment, for that all Preſentments (as the ſaid <hi>James Jones</hi> is adviſed)
ought to be certain, and not doubtful, before any Anſwer by Law ought to be given. The Law
of this Realm of <hi>England,</hi> not compelling any perſon to accuſe himſelf: and by the words of this
pretended Preſentment, the ſaid Church-Wardens have not accuſed him of any Crime, but only
ſaith they cannot of their own knowledge, know who of the Pariſhoners, who have, and who have
not been at Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And further they do not remember to have ſeen the ſaid <hi>James Jones,</hi> &amp;c.
at Church for three months laſt past: which is no Charge according to Law, for that it ought
to be certain, that the ſaid <hi>James Jones, &amp;c.</hi> did not come to his Pariſh Church.</p>
                  <p>4. The ſaid <hi>James Jones</hi> ſaith, That it doth not appear by the pretended Preſentment, That
he the ſaid <hi>James Jones</hi> is the perſon Preſented; foraſmuch as his full and compleat Name was
not in the Preſentment, at the time of the Exhibition thereof. And he the ſaid <hi>James Jones,</hi>
conceives it cannot be Legally inſerted ar added afterwards in the ſaid Preſentment.</p>
                  <p>All which the ſaid <hi>James Jones</hi> does inſist upon and prays this Court, to take the
ſame into their Conſideration, and that he may be hence Diſcharged.</p>

                     <dateline>Subſcribed and delivered into the Eccleſiaſtical Court, by the hand of <hi>James Jones,</hi> on

            <p>THE ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> having thus proceeded, he waited ſeveral daies, thinking he ſhould
be Cited to have ſome kind of Anſwer to his Plea: whether it was Accepted or
Rejected; but not hearing any thing at all, upon the Eleventh of <hi>December,</hi> the ſaid
<hi>Jones</hi> went again to Doctor <hi>Pinfolds</hi> Court in the Tabernacle of <hi>Old-Fiſh-Street, London;</hi>
that ſo he might obſerve Proceedings, and to make anſwer if he ſhould be called upon.
Which day many Pleas were delivered into the ſaid Court; which the Doctor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with great civillity, and promiſed a Hearing of them all, the next Fryday fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
The ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> being not that day called, kept ſilence, and did not urge his
own Caſe, leaſt he ſhould be counted a Troubler of that Court; and therefore reſolved
to attend Doctor <hi>Pinfold</hi> the Fryday following: concluding that then he ſhould have
opportunity to have his Plea debated as well as others. Eſpecially conſidering that
his Plea was one of the firſt that was delivered into that Court.</p>
            <p>When Fryday came, which was the Fourteenth of <hi>December;</hi> the ſaid <hi>Jones,</hi> with a
great number of His Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects, went to <hi>Doctors Commons;</hi> for
Doctor <hi>Pinfold</hi> had ordered the Hearing of the Pleas to be there in, a very large
place, like a great Hall, which looked ſomewhat more like a Court than the Tabernacle.
At which time Doctor <hi>Pinfold</hi> appeared as Judge. And Counſellor <hi>Welden</hi> and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor
<hi>Hooke,</hi> and one of the Doctors belonging to the ſame Court, <hi>viz.</hi> Doctor <hi>Rains,</hi>
appeared to Plead for them that had put in their Pleas. And the Cauſe of Mr. <hi>Morty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
and one Mr. <hi>Duberry,</hi> were debated, with great Soberneſs and ſtrength of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
touching the Errors of the Preſentments, and that Courts Impoſing the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
at ſuch particular times as the the Law doth not Impoſe it upon any of His
Majeſties Subjects. Doctor <hi>Pinfold</hi> ſaw he was hard put to it, in the beginning of this
work, and therefore, after a little Debate of the matter, between him and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers:
he ſpread forth his hands and ſaid, he would hear no more Pleas, but he would
Anſwer them all by the Seal of the Court to morrow morning. And ſo the Doctor
went away without any Formal Adjourning the Court, or diſmiſſing that great Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly;
not any Officer appearing to open his mouth, ſo much as to ſay, God ſave
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53929:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the King. And ſo that great Aſſembly departed, in very peaceable manner, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
His Majeſties peaceable Subjects, though greived in their minds at ſuch proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
The ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> was ready to appear in his own Caſe, if he had been called,
or if there had been opportunity: he being prepared with a Supplyment to his Plea:
drawn up by the Learned in the Law. A Copy whereof take as followeth.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">

                  <head>The further Anſwer and Supplyment of James Jones, to the Preſentment aforeſaid.</head>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Imprimis</note>THE ſaid <hi>James Jones</hi> ſaving and reſerving, as in his former Anſwer he hath already
prayed, ſaith, That it doth not appear by the ſaid Preſentment, or pretended
Preſentment, That the ſame was made upon the Oaths of the ſaid Church-Wardens: which the
ſaid <hi>James Jones,</hi> is Adviſed ought to have been Aſſerted in the ſaid Preſentment, or pretended
Preſentment, in regard (as the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> is adviſed) no Preſentment is legal and ſufficient in
the Law, to be Anſwered unto: nor ought the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> to Anſwer any Preſentment but what
is given in upon Oath to this Court. The Laws and Customs of this Land not pemitting any
of the Kings Leige Subjects, to be any ways vexed or greived, or to be called into question by
any Court whatſoever, thereby to be Charged with any Offence; but upon the Oath of One
or more perſons. Nor ought any Accuſations to be received by this Court againſt the ſaid <hi>James
Jones</hi> but upon Oath. For that the ſaid <hi>James Jones</hi> is a free born Subject of <hi>England;</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convicted
or Accuſed legally of any Crime, and therefore is Adviſed he ought not to make
any Anſwer to ſuch a Preſentment, until it doth appear to be according to Law.</p>
                  <p>2. And the ſaid <hi>James Jones</hi> ſaith, That by no Law of this Realm, any Lay-man can be
compelled or Obliged to Receive the Sacrament, more or oftner, than three times in the year,
<hi>viz,</hi> at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and the two other times in the year are left free, and Indifferent, to the party;
when he is best fitted and prepared. And the ſaid <hi>James Jones</hi> ſaith, he is a Layman, and doth
not know of any Law, that doth Abridge him of that Liberty; or oblige him to Receive it oftner;
or otherwiſe in any fixed time: wherefore, foraſmuch as the Church-Wardens, that made the
ſaid Preſentment, or pretended Preſentment, could not Legally Preſent the ſaid <hi>James Jones,</hi>
for any Offence, but ſuch as do, or ſhal ariſe ſince <hi>Eaſter</hi> last: and for that there is abundantly
ſufficient time, for him the ſaid <hi>James Jones,</hi> to perform what by Law is required, <hi>viz.</hi> to
Receive the Sacrament twice betwixt this and <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and once then. And that as the ſaid
<hi>James Jones</hi> hath not broken any Law, ſo neither, as he conceives and is adviſed, is there any
ground for any Citation or Admonition againſt him, nor that any Admonition ſhould or can li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him where the Law hath left him free; nor may this Court Compell him by Eccleſiaſtical
Cenſures, or otherwiſe, to Receive the Holy Sacrament in a ſhorter or fixed Time, or any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
limit him than the Law hath ſpecified, directed, or allowed.</p>

            </p>
            <p>AND furthermore the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> ſaith, That beſides all that is contained in his
Plea, and Supplyment to the ſaid Plea, he had more Matter to be Argued in his
Defence againſt the aforeſaid Preſentment, to ſhow the deficiency and inſufficiency
thereof. A brief account of which take as followeth.</p>
            <p>1. He the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> ſaith, That there is no mention of what Dioceſs the aforeſaid Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
(and he as Inhabitant thereof) is, which ſhould have been plainly Expreſſed in the
ſaid Preſentment.</p>
            <p>2. The ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> ſaith, That he was Proſecuted for Non-conformity, before His
Majeſties Juſtices of the Peace, in the County of <hi>Surrey,</hi> and particularly for not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Church: which is the ſame thing mentioned in the Church-Wardens Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and for which the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> is Excommunicated. Now for the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> to be
puniſhed in the Temporal Courts and in the Eccleſiaſtical Court, at or about the ſame
time, ſeems be contrary to the Statute of <hi>Anno primo Regni Eliz.</hi> Chap. 2. which ſaith,</p>
            <p>Provided alwaies, and be it Enacted, That whatſoever perſons Offending in the premiſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſhall for their Offences firſt receive Puniſhment of the Ordinary, having a Teſtimonial there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
under the ſaid Ordinaries Seal: ſhall not for the ſame Offencee eftſoons be Convict be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53929:9"/>
the Iuſtices: and likewiſe Receiving for the ſaid Offence puniſhment, firſt by the
Iuſtices: ſhall not for the ſame Offence eftſoons Receive puniſhment of the Ordinary,
any thing contained in this Act to the contrary notwithſtanding.</p>
            <p>3. And he the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> ſaith, That the Church-Wardens did not in their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment
Alledge againſt him, That he had not any Lawful or Reaſonable Cauſe to
ſhow why he had not been at Church or Sacrament of ſo long a time, mentioned in
the preſentment. <hi>See 1 Eliz. Cap. 2. Paragraph 14.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. And he the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> ſaith, That whereas Errors in an Indictment at Seſſions
or Aſſizes, or Errors in a <hi>Mittimus</hi> whereby a man is Committed to priſon, will when
Legally Pleaded, overthrow and make void ſuch Indictment or Commitment, and ſo
relieve the Indicted and Committed perſon; Even ſo and much more ſhould the ſaid
<hi>Jones</hi> by reaſon of a Deficient and Inſufficient Preſentment, be Diſcharged from the
Eccleſiaſtical Court, as he prayed in his aforeſaid plea and Supplyment, and therefore
the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> doth conclude, that it is better to be concerned with the Kings Juſtices,
and Judges, who Sitt by Commiſſion from the King, in the Kings Courts of Record,
than to be concerned with any Eccleſiaſtical Court, and ſuch as are Doctors and
Judges in the ſaid Courts.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> further ſaith, he heard no more from <hi>Doctors-Commons</hi> till the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
of <hi>December,</hi> and then the Doctor of his Pariſh, <hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Bartholomew Exchange,</hi> did
in very friendly manner acquaint the ſaid <hi>Jones,</hi> that an Excomunication againſt him
was come from <hi>Doctors Commons.</hi> and that the ſaid Doctor was ordred to publiſh the
ſaid Excommunication next morning, being St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s day: unto which the ſaid
<hi>Jones</hi> Reply'd, That the Eccleſiaſtical Court had proceeded Illegally in going ſo far
as an Excommunication, and demonſtrated the ſame in two Particulars, Firſt, that he
the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> had given a Plea in Law to that Court againſt the aforeſaid Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and was never admitted to be heard upon his Plea, which is contrary to the
Laws of <hi>England,</hi> to have any Sentence paſs upon any man to his damage, without his
Cauſe be Legally heard and Debated. Secondly, That it was not in the power of the
Eccleſiaſtical Court Legally to Excommunicate the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> for not taking the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
at any ſuch time as that Court ſhould at their pleaſure Appoint, there being
but one time of the year named for Receiving the Sacrament, <hi>viz: Eaſter.</hi> The afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Doctor reply'd, he was ſorry things were brought to ſuch a point, but he could
not avoid obeying the Order of <hi>Doctors Commons,</hi> and ſo the next day being <hi>Dec. 23.</hi> called
St. <hi>Thomas</hi> day, the Excommunication was publiſhed in the Pariſh Church called St. <hi>Barth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Exchange:</hi> and upon the Twenty third day of the ſame Month, the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi>
went with a Witneſs with him to the Regiſters Office, and demanded a Copy of the
Libel againſt him, but the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> could not have it though he offered payment for the
ſaid Libel. And upon the Twenty Sixth of the ſame Month, the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> took wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
with him and demanded a Copy of all the Proceedings of the Court, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
a Copy of his Plea: the Clerk did promiſe a Copy of the proceedings of the
Court, but could not let him have them at that time. And upon the Thirtieth day of
the ſame Month, the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> went and a witneſs with him for the aforeſaid Copy, but
it was not done; the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> then allowed the Clerk till the next <hi>Monday,</hi> and the
Clerk would not promiſe to have thoſe things copied by that time, pleading it was Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-daies,
and that was the reaſon they were not done; the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> replyed, That
it was a ſtrange thing to him, they could not write their own proceedings upon a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-day,
as well as Excommunicate him upon a Holy-day. The ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> waited till
<hi>Wedenſday</hi> the Third of <hi>January,</hi> and then went with his friend for the aforeſaid Copy,
and then the Clerk ſaid, That he whom he had appointed to draw out the aforeſaid
Copy was out of the way, himſelf was going from the Office at that time, and ſo the
ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> came away without what he ſo much endeavored to have, going more times to
the Office than he was bound to do.</p>
            <p>Thus things remained till about a fortnight before <hi>Hilary</hi> Term, and then the ſaid
<hi>Jones</hi> went and made Affidavit, before Judge <hi>Charleton:</hi> the form of the ſaid Affidavit
is as followeth, <hi>James Jones</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Merchant-Taylor, depoſeth upon Oath, That
he was Cited into the Eccleſiaſtical Court, before Doctor <hi>Pinfold,</hi> and made his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and ſince hath been at the Regiſters Office, and there demanded a Copy of his
Libel, but could not obtain it, though he offered payment for the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:53929:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And after this upon the twenty third day of <hi>January, 1682.</hi> being the firſt day
of the Term, the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> with a few others moved the Honourable Judges of the
Kings Court of Common Pleas, for Prohibitions, upon the not obtaining Copies of
their Libels, when demanded, and payment offered for the ſame; the particular Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davits
of that matter being read in Court, and moved by ſeveral Serjeants at Law:
the Judges were pleaſed to grant Prohibitions with a <hi>Niſi cauſa, viz.</hi> if Doctor <hi>Pinfold</hi>
could not ſhew cauſe againſt them, and a Rule of Court was ſerved upon Doctor <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold</hi>
to Appear before the Judges of the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> on <hi>Fryday</hi> the twenty Sixth of the
ſame Month, but the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> thought it expedient to move the honourable Judges
of the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> for a Prohibition, and therefore made Affidavit of not obtaining a
Copy of his Libel, before the honourable Judge <hi>Dolben;</hi> and it was read before the
Judges of the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> upon the twenty fifth of the ſame Month, and that honourable
Bench was pleaſed to grant a Prohibition for the ſaid <hi>Jones,</hi> but the next day being
the twenty ſixth of <hi>January,</hi> Doctor <hi>Pinfold</hi> engaged Sir <hi>George Jefferies,</hi> who is well
known to be a Lawyer that will ſtoutly defend and maintain the cauſe he is engaged in,
either for the King, or any of his own Clients, againſt the plaintiff or defendant, on
the other ſide, and in this Caſe, there was no want of words by Sir <hi>George,</hi> to overthow
the Prohibitions, both at <hi>Kings Bench</hi> and <hi>Common Pleas:</hi> but the ſaid <hi>Jones,</hi> doth take
it a little unkindly that Sir <hi>George Jefferies</hi> ſhould with ſuch ſharpneſs of Spirit reflect
upon him, before the honourable Judges, as if he had ſurreptitiouſly obtained the grant
of a Prohibition, and highly blamed the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> for moving in two of His Majeſties
Courts for the ſaid Prohibition; but if the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> had been then in Court, he would
have ventured by humble deſire to the honourable Judges, to make a modeſt and honeſt
reply to that Gentleman without being ſo ſharp upon him, and therein have ſhewed,
that the obtaining that Grant of a Prohibition, could not fairly be counted Surreptiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
becauſe the honourable Judges granted it upon the Affidavit of the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi>
then read in Court, the truth of which Affidavit the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> would have ſworn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the Judges of <hi>England, viz.</hi> that he had been at the Regiſters Office and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
a Copy of his Libel, and could not obtain it, though he offered paymnent for
the ſame, and in this very caſe the Law hath provided a Prohibition, for the the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leif
of the Kings Subjects, who are too often vexed by the Eccleſiaſtical Courts: See
the Statute of the 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> V. chap. 3. the words are theſe,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> Foraſmuch as divers of the Kings liege people, be daily Cited to appear in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual

which touch Free-hold, Debts, Treſpaſs, Covenants, and other things wherof cogniſance
partaineth to the Courts of our Lord the King, as of Matrimony and Teſtament, and when
ſuch perſons ſo Cited appear and demand a Libel of that which againſt them is ſurmiſed to
be informed to give their anſwer thereunto, or otherwiſe to purchaſe a Writ of our Lord the
King, of Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Spiritual Iudges, to the intent that ſuch perſons ſhould not be aided by any ſuch Writ
againſt the Law, and to the great damage of ſuch perſons ſo impleaded: our ſaid Lord
the King by the advice and aſſent of his Lords Spiritual, and Temporal and at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtance of the ſaid Commons, hath Ordained and eſtabliſhed, that at what time
the Libel is grantable by the Law, that it may be granted and delivered to the party without
any difficulty. <hi>From which good Statute, let theſe things be conſidered,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That the Spiritual Courts ought to have Libels of thoſe matters that are ſurmiſed
againſt the Kings Leige people,</p>
            <p>2. That upon demand, without any delaies, copies of ſuch Libels ought to be given
to ſuch of the Kings Leige people as make a demand of them, that thereby they may be
enabled to make a legal defence for themſelves, either reſpecting the matter of fact ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
againſt them, or any illegal Proceedings in the mannagement thereof.</p>
            <p>3. That ſuch of the Kings leige people as are denied or cannot obtain a copy of ſuch
Libel when grantable by Law, ſhall have the Kings Writ of Prohibition, for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leif;
or if the matters ſurmiſed againſt them in the Spiritual Court be ſuch things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
cogniſance pertaineth to the Court of our Lord the King; beſides thoſe of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
Debt, Treſpaſs or Covenants, they may have for their releif a Prohibition.</p>
            <p>Now the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> humbly conceives that the matters ſurmiſed againſt him in the
Spiritual Courts are ſuch things whereof cogniſance pertaineth to the Court of our
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53929:10"/>
Lord the King, <hi>viz.</hi> an uncertain Information of the Church-Wardens, ſaying in their
Preſentment, They could not of their own knowledge prove who of the Pariſhioners
have, and who have not been at Church, and that they did not remember to have ſeen
the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> at Church for ſome time paſt, or to have Received the Sacrament, for
three Months paſt: and beſides theſe things ſurmiſed, when they were in the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Court, a Copy of a Libel concerning them could not be obtained when demanded,
upon which the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> moved for a Prohibition; but Sir <hi>George Jefferies</hi> in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
the cauſe for Doctor <hi>Pinfold,</hi> did plead there was no Libel in that caſe, and
therefore the Eccleſiaſtical Court could not grant it when demanded, and that Doctor
<hi>Pinfold</hi> had proceeded by the Preſentment of the Church-Wardens. The ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> doth
not blame Sir <hi>George</hi> for making this Plea for the Doctor; but the queſtion is, Whether
Doctor <hi>Pinfold</hi> ought not to have a Libel in the Caſe, as well as a Preſentment? the
Statute mentioning a Libel of things ſurmiſed againſt the Kings liege people: however
the Kings Subjects have good cauſe to eſteem the Proceedings of the Kings Courts of
Juſtice, where there is not only Preſentments but afterwards Indictments, and time allowed
to the Kings Subjects to defend themſelves, and the Accuſers brought to the face of the
Accuſed, and upon not making ſubſtantial proof of matters of fact, the Kings accuſed
ſubjects are by the Judges and the Law diſcharged: but the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> and a multitude
of his fellow Proteſtants, have not had ſuch fair dealings in Doctor <hi>Pinfold</hi>'s Court,
and therefore the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> hath cauſe to ſay, <hi>From ſuch Courts, and ſuch Proceedings,
Good Lord deliver us.</hi> And whereas the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> is informed that Sir <hi>George</hi> did reflect
upon him for moving in the Kings Court of Common Pleas, before he came to move in
the Kings Bench, for a Prohibition: as being willing to have two ſtrings to his Bow, the
ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> doth humbly deſire Sir <hi>George</hi> to conſider that it is every mans concern to do
his beſt and uſe the utmoſt means in a legal way, to accompliſh his relief: and the ſaid
<hi>Jones</hi> doth believe that if it had been his happineſs to have engaged Sir <hi>George Jefferies</hi> as
his Conncel in this caſe, it had not been loſt for want of ſpeaking to it, as it was by the
Silence of ſome Serjeants at Law, that were expected to make ſome Reply in that Caſe;
and the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Pemberton,</hi> then Sitting upon the Bench, was willing to hear
a Reply. What was the cauſe of that ſilence, whether becauſe they could not ſpeak,
or becauſe they would not ſpeak, or becauſe they dared not to ſpeak, or becauſe they
had not ſufficient Fees to ſpeak, Grand-father Time muſt ſhew. But whether becauſe one
Serjeant ſpoke ſo much, and others ſaid nothing at all, Prohibitions weare over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
in <hi>Weſtminster-Hall,</hi> ſhall be leſt to conſideration. However the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> ſaith,
That he was encouraged to take this way, becauſe divers of the Kings Subjects have
thereby had releif, formerly, from the power of the Eccleſiaſtical Courts, who were
under the ſame circumſtances, and therefore the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> doth humbly pray Sir <hi>George
Jefferies</hi> to conſider, that not every cauſe he hath mannaged, either for the Plaintiff
or Defendant, hath gone currant before the Judges in <hi>Westminſter-Hall,</hi> which is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
evidence that either the cauſe undertaken was not right, or elſe that Sir <hi>George</hi>'s
Clients had ſome wrong; and therefore no marvel if one or other of theſe things have
attended poor <hi>Jones,</hi> and others, who have proceeded by the Advice of the Learned
in the Law: however this little victory over <hi>Jones</hi> and his fellow Proteſtants gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to Doctor <hi>Pinfold</hi> to rejoice and boaſt and glory that night at Doctors Commons,
as if his cauſe were fifty in the hundred the better for that daies work; but it is humbly
deſired by the ſaid <hi>Jones,</hi> that the Doctor would ſeriouſly couſider that ſaying in a good
old Book called, <hi>The Holy Bible: Let not him that girdeth on his harneſs, Boaſt himſelf as he
that putteth it off,</hi> 1 Kings 20. 11.</p>
            <p>Furtthermore, The ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> doth certifie Doctor <hi>Pinfold,</hi> and all others concerned,
That he hath a love and a reverent Eſteem of the Holy Sacrament, called in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<hi>the Supper of the Lord,</hi> and hath ſolemnly as becometh a Chriſtian, Taken the ſaid

which worthily receive the holy Sacrament: and danger and indignation of Almighty God
threatened to them which ſhall preſume to receive the ſame unworthily, to the end that every
man may try and examine his own conſcience, before he ſhall receive the ſame. The ſaid
Miniſter ſhall not without a lawful cauſe, deny the ſame to any perſon, that will devoutly

            <p>But it is ſuppoſed that Doctor <hi>Pinfold</hi> will ſay, That the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> hath not taken the
ſaid Sacrament in his own Pariſh Church, according to the Admonition, at the time there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
prefixed by the ſaid Doctor: unto which the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> doth ſoberly reply, That
he doth not know of any Statute Law, that impowereth the Doctor thus to proceed,
or that bindeth the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> to obey, and is much more ſure; that there is no Law of
Jeſus Chriſt, in all the New Teſtament for ſuch proceedings: however the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi>
ſaith, That he hath taken the holy Communion, in ſuch a Church as is declared and owned
in the Nineteenth Article of the Church of England, <hi>viz. That the Viſible Church of
Christ is a company of faithful men, in which the pure Word of God is Preached, and the
Sacraments be duly Adminiſtred, according to Christs Ordinance, in all things that of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
are requiſite to the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> ſaith, That himſelf and a vaſt number of His Majeſties Proteſtant
ſubjects, do exerciſe a Godly care, and maketh great Conſcience to Wait upon God,
in no other Aſſemblies then is expreſſed in the aforſaid Article, <hi>viz. A company of
faithful people that have the pure Word of God truly preached, and the Ordinances of God duly
adminiſtred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it may be the Doctor will ſay, That <hi>Jones</hi> meaneth the aſſemblies of Diſenters.</p>
            <p>To which <hi>Jones</hi> doth reply, That he honeſtly meaneth no other Aſſemblies, but ſuch
where Chriſt is preached, as he is declared in the holy Goſpel:</p>
            <p>1. As God and Man.</p>
            <p>2. As being Conceived in the Virgins womb, by the Holy Ghoſt, and ſo brought
forth into the world to be the Saviour of Sinners.</p>
            <p>3. His Death as the Satisfaction of Divine Juſtice.</p>
            <p>4. His Reſurrection, for the Juſtification of all True Beleivers.</p>
            <p>5. His Aſcenſion into heaven, and making Interceſſion at the right hand of God, that ſo
the Godly may be accepted of God, and be received into heaven.</p>
            <p>6. The Second Coming of Chriſt to Judge the quick and the dead: at which time of
Judgement, he will receive the Righteous into Eternal happineſs, and ſend the wicked
into Eternal miſery, after the reſurrection of the juſt and unjuſt.</p>
            <p>And as touching the holy Sacraments the aforeſaid Aſſemblies doth profeſs and practice
water Baptiſm, as Gods holy Ordinance, and the Lords Supper in both kinds, of Bread
and Wine, as a holy Remembrance of Chriſts Death till he come again, as it is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in the Holy Scripture, and in the before mentioned Statute of 1 <hi>Edw. 6.</hi> chap. 1.
which Statute doth not compel any of the Kings ſubjects to come to that bleſſed Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
to the damage of their own Souls, but ſtrictly warneth to the contrary and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
perſons to come humbly and devoutly, of their owne deſire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:53929:11"/>
Now therefore why the ſaid <hi>Jone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> or any other of the Kings Proteſtant ſubjects, ſhould
be proſecuted to the ſuffering Impriſonment, for not taking the Sacramnt in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
Pariſh Churches, who are zealous for the holy Sacrament, &amp; other parts of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion, in ſuch aſſemblies as are for higher degrees of Reformation than is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the common Proteſtants: it is humbly preſented to Doctor <hi>Pinfold,</hi> and all others
called Doctors and Judges, in Courts called Spiritual, whether they can produce any
ſuch Authority from Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Spiritual Governour in his Church, and
hath given Spiritual Laws for the government thereof.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> ſaith, he hath carefully read the Holy Scriptures for many years, and
could never find that ever Chriſt did ſet up ſuch a way of Government in his Church,
<hi>viz.</hi> of Fines, Impriſonments, Baniſhment, or any other corporal puniſhment, to bring
perſons to conform unto his Goſpel Ordinances, but Chriſts way was to aford plain
and powerful preaching of his Word, to inlighten the mind, and perſwade the Soul, to
make a free choice of his Ttruths, from a cordial love to himſelf: but according to
the proceedings of Doctor <hi>Pinfold,</hi> and other Eccleſiaſtical Judges, ſuch as are conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiouſly
afraid they ſhall miſs the comforts and bleſſed benefits of the Sacrament, by
coming to it at ſuch times and places, with ſuch Communicants, as impoſed by the ſaid
Doctor, muſt be contented with the diſcomforts of a Jail, or elſe pay great ſums of mony
to get off.</p>
            <p>And whereas the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aid Doctor did declare, in the publick Aſſembly of Doctors Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
that he fixed the taking of the Sacrament, in his admonitions, that thereby the
people might give a full demonſtration of being true Proteſtants: it is humbly deſired
that the Doctor would conſider, whether too many, who venture upon the Sacrament,
are not a great Scandal to the Proteſtant Religion, by wicked converſations, in Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Drinking, Curſing, and calling upon God to damn them: and the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> doth
heartily deſire, that the men of Doctors Commons, were quite free from all theſe ſins,
the leaſt of which is enough for damnation, and that is ten thouſand times worſe than
Excommunication: however it may be ſoberly and ſafely concluded, that ſuch perſons
are very unfit to drive others to the Sacrament, or puniſh them for not running ſo head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
as they would have them unto ſuch an holy Ordinance of God.</p>
            <p>And beſides all the former Relation, the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> ſaith, That upon the ſeventh of
<hi>February,</hi> he went again to the Regiſters Office, belonging to the Eccleſiaſtical Court,
and there demanded a Copy of his Excommunication, and all other proceedings of the
Court, but the chief Regiſter was very angry becauſe rhoſe things had been beſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke
ſo long before, and were not fetch'd away, and reflected upon <hi>Jones</hi> as if he had not
done honeſtly: unto which <hi>Jones</hi> replyed ſaying, Sir, I ſuppoſe you do not know that
I have been more times for theſe papers, than I was bound to come, and could not have
them, however if they are done, let me have them, and my money is ready for you:
upon this great ſearch was made to find the papers, but the Clerks could not find them,
nor the Regiſter neither, but one put it off to another, as being miſlayed. <hi>Jones</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them in confuſion, thought they might better find them in his abſence, and therefore
told them, he would go to ſome houſe hard by and come again, and about an hour after,
<hi>Jones</hi> returned to the Office, but they were not found: notwithſtanding all this, <hi>Jones</hi>
was fo fair as to give them till the afternoon, and the under Regiſter did promiſe that the
papers ſhould be ſent by their Officer who brought the Citation; ſo the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> went
away in farther Exerciſe of patience, but the papers did not come all that day. <hi>Jones</hi>
waited for them all the next day, till near night, and becauſe they were not ſent,
he went and made Affidavit before a Judge, That he had been four ſeveral times at the
Regiſters, to have a Copy of his Excommunication, and all other proceedings of the
Eccleſiaſtical Court, but could not have them, though he offered payment, and to leave
part of payment in hand, and about an hour after the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> had been at home, the
ſaid papers were ſent to his houſe, <hi>viz.</hi> about Seven a Clock at night, with a Note from
one of the Clerks, to pay thirteen Shillings and four pence for them, which was payed
and ſent back by the meſſenger that brought them. Now the honeſt de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ign of
<hi>Jones</hi> in thus labouring to have ſuch papers, was to ſee whether any thing as matter of
Law, might ariſe from them, ſit for the conſideration of the honourable Judges, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> might have ſome legal releif, but now the Term was very near ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring,
and not ſufficient time to conſult with thoſe Learned in the Law, to make
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53929:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
any Progreſs, and ſo the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> remained in the Exerciſe of Patience.</p>
            <p>But Doctor <hi>Pinfold</hi> went on to finiſh his Work, and to perform his Word to the ſaid <hi>Jones,</hi>
viz. That he ſhould be laid up in a Jail, if he did not come to Church and take the Sacrament
according to his Admonition; for in the cloſe of the Term, the ſaid Spiritual Doctor did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
ſeveral Writs of <hi>Excommunicato Capiendo,</hi> from the Temporal Power, to apprehend a
great Number of the Kings Proteſtant Subjects, and Subſtantial Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> and to
carry them to Priſon for not obeying his Admonitions, and thereby ſeparate Husbands from
Wives, Parents from Children, Maſters from Servants, beſides hindring many Perſons from
Managing their honeſt and Lawful Trades and Callings, to the damage of many good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
the whole of which Puniſhment the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> doth hope he ſhall bear with Patience,
as the Providence of God ſhall ſuffer it to come upon him, being well ſatisfied that Loyalty
and Chriſtianity will keep him Company, when in a Jail for Non-Conformity.</p>
            <p>And now the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> doth think it may be of ſome Advantage to his fellow Proteſtants
that they be acquainted with the ſeveral ways allowed and practiced by Doctor <hi>Pinfold,</hi> for
Obtaining an Abſolution, and ſo be diſcharged from the Writ <hi>Excommunicato Capiendo,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it is out againſt, and ſerved upon them.</p>
            <p>I. Such perſons may be abſolved and diſcharged from the ſaid Writ if they will pay all the
Charges of the Court, which is ſometimes Ordinary; and ſometimes Extraordinary, the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Charges is about forty ſhillings, but according as matters have been managed between
the Proſecuted Party and the ſaid Doctor, the Charges by the Doctors Bill may amount to
five or Six Pounds, or more. And beſides the payment of ſuch Charges, the Party muſt depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
Ten Pound, or other ſuch Sum as the Doctor will impoſe, and ſubſcribe that the ſaid Sum
of Money ſhall be forfeited and diſpoſed of as the ſaid Doctor ſhall think meet, <hi>viz.</hi> If the
Party do not come to Church and take the Sacrament at ſuch times as the Doctor will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point;
at which inſtant, <hi>viz.</hi> when the money is tendred down, he giveth his Admonition ſo
to do.</p>
            <p>II. Another way to be abſolved and diſcharged from the ſaid Writ, is, to pay the aforeſaid
Bill of Charges, and take an Oath to conform, <hi>viz. You ſhall ſwear that you will obey all the
Kings Eccleſiaſtical Laws, and the Lawful Commands of your Ordinary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ſuch as think to deliver themſelves this way, had beſt in the firſt place get a true Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of the Eccleſiaſtical Laws, what they are, and what are the Lawful Commands
of the Ordinary, leaſt they ſhould ſwear to ſuch things as may be againſt their Conſciences,
and ſo be under a force either to Sin by keeping the Oath, or elſe Sin by Breaking the Oath;
which if the latter, they muſt expect to hear of it from Doctor <hi>Pinfold</hi> with both their Ears.</p>
            <p>III. Another way of Deliverance is to give Bond to Dr. <hi>Pinfold,</hi> to conform by ſuch a time
as ſhall be agreed with the ſaid Doctor, or elſe to forfeit the Sum of Money expreſſed in the
ſaid Bond, which formerly was uſed to be but ten Pound, but now the ſaid Doctor doth Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a Bond of Thirty Pounds, and beſides this, the aforeſaid Bill of Charges muſt be preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
paid, and at the ſealing and delivering of the aforeſaid Bond, the ſaid Doctor will Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
the party to come to Church and receive the Sacrament according to the time of
the Bond. The Condition of which Bond take as followeth.</p>
