            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>That without the ſight of that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we could not have bin induced by any flying rumors to beleeve, that the Scottiſh Nation, or the prevailing party for the preſent in that Nation, would have attempted an Invaſion of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: ſo contrary to the Lawes of God, of Nations, of both Kingdoms, and eſpecially to the late Act of Pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſo oppoſite to their Allegiance and gratitude to His Majeſty, to that neighbourly love which they pretend, to that diſcreet care which they ſhould have of their own ſafety.</p>

And for the Engliſh agents, we cannot believe them to be any Commiſſioners Lawfully authorized, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Parliament, or by the two Houſes, or yet by the Houſe of Commons, whence ſo many of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are expelled by partiall Votes, ſo many baniſhed by ſeditious tumults, ſo many voluntarily abſent themſelves out of Conſcience, where deſperation or want of opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to depart, or feare of certain Plunder, are the chiefeſt Bonds which hold the little remnant together from diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, where the venerable name of PARLIAMENT is made a ſtale to Countenance the pernitious Counſailes and Acts of a Cloſe Committee.</p>
            <p>For Subjects to make forraigne Confederacies without their Soveraignes aſſent, to invade the territories of their undoubted King, to goe about by force to change the Lawes and Religion eſtabliſhed, is groſſe Treaſon without all contradiction; And in this caſe it Argues ſtrongly, who have been the contrivers and fomenters of all our troubles.

We do not remember that ever the like indignity was offered by one Nation to another, by a leſſer to a greater, That thoſe men who have heretofore pleaded ſo vehemently for Liberty of Conſcience, againſt all Oathes and Subſcriptions, ſhould now aſſume a power to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by Armes to impoſe a Law upon the Conſciences of their fellow Subjects. A vanquiſhed Nation would ſcarce endure ſuch Tearmes from their Conquerers.</p>
            <p>But this We are ſure of, that this is the way to make the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> odious to all Monarchs, Chriſtian and Pagan.</p>
            <p>Your other two ends, that is the Honour and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the King, and the publique Peace and Liberty of His Dominions, are ſo manifeſtly contrary to your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, that We need no other motives to withdraw you from ſuch a Courſe, as tends ſo directly to make His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty Contemptible at home and abroad, and to fill all His Dominions with Rapine and Blood.</p>
            <p>In an Army all have not the ſame intentions, Wee have ſeen the Articles agreed upon, and thoſe vaſt Sums and Conditions, contained in them, as if our Countreymen

thought that England was indeed a Well that could never be drawn dry, and whatſoever the intentions be, We know right well what will be the conſequents: if it were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, no intention or conſequent whatſoever can juſtify an unlawfull Action. And therefore you do wiſely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline all diſputation about it, it is an eaſy thing to pretend the Cauſe of God, as the Iewes did the Temple of the Lord, but this is farre from thoſe evident demonſtrations, which you often mention, never make.</p>
            <p>Conſider that there muſt be an Account given to God of all the blood which ſhall be ſhed in this quarrell. The way to prevent it, is not by ſuch inſinuations, but to retire before the Sword be unſheathed, or the breach be made too wide; you cannot think that we are grown ſuch tame Creatures, to deſert our Religion, our Lawes, our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, our Eſtates, upon command of Forreigners, and to ſuffer our ſelves and our Poſterity, to be made Beggers and Slaves without oppoſition. If any of ours ſhall joyne with you in this Action, we cannot look upon them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then as Traitors to their King, Vipers to their native Country, and ſuch as have been Plotters or Fomenters of this deſigne from the beginning. But if misinformation or Feare, hath drawn any of yours ignorantly or unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly into this Cauſe, We deſire them to withdraw themſelves at laſt, and not to make themſelves acceſſaries to that deluge of Miſchiefe which this ſecond voyage is like to bring upon both Kingdomes.</p>
