            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

SIR VVILLIAM
CICILL, OF THE NOBLE ORDER OF
THE GARTER KNIGHT, BARON OF
Burghley, Lord high Treasurer of Englande, and one of hir
Maiesties most honorable priuie Counsell.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S THE first Styrpe whereof we did
spring (Right Honorable) was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched
by that wily &amp; wicked ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent:
Euen so the same wicked ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
hath neuer since ceased, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunt
and bewitch hir posteritie,
knowing them to be hir deare dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
and sweete mouthed like their
mother. For who is it that feedeth
not where fancie doth fauour? And
what fauoureth fancie, but sweete
pleasaunt poyson? That flattering
feend, was the first founder of our
fond affection, and entised EVE did
spinne the threede of our thraldom:
but ADAM (alas) did weaue vp this
wofull web. And hath not his pieuish posteritie delited euer since to prowle
for their pleasure, though it worke their owne woe: yea beside wicked praise
and priuate profit to the hurt of other. And to make it more manifest, what
thing hath bene done from the beginning, or is now dailie practised (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of a few) but only for selfe pleasure, wicked praise, or priuat profit? Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
hereof are as rare to be founde, as to espie one winke that sleepeth,
nothing almost hath else bene esteemed, &amp; what else at this time of vs is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced?
But if we will not wilfullie winke, but willinglie see, the publike
paine such pleasures haue preferred, the perilous practises such praise hath
permitted, &amp; the pitifull penurie such profit hath procured: that it will make
vs loath that so many hath loued, cause vs detest that so many haue desired,
&amp; feare vs to fauor that thousands haue followed. LVCIFER the ringleader
of this daunce practising for his pleasure to be higher than God did appoint
him, brought him selfe and many thousands of Angells to endles sorrowes:
<pb facs="tcp:10199:3"/>
EVES pleasure in the forbodden apple, wrought the greatest displeasure to
man that could be: DAVIDS pleasure in the beautie of a woman cost V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIAS
his life: the pleasure of HOLOFERNES in IVDITH, was the losse
of his head, and the spoile of his armie: many a giltlesse child was murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for the pleasure of HEROD: the pleasure that ACHAE had in a litle
vineyard, caused NABOTH be killed: NEROES vile pleasure, made his
mother be murthered, his sister deslowred, and Rome to be burned. Wicked
praise likewise hath bin preferred to the great grief of both godly &amp; other:
for did not PILATE to be praised of the people, saue a murtherer and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Christ? did not HEROD to be praised for the keeping of his
wicked promise, cause IOHN BAPTISTS head to be cut of? Did not
CAMEISES to be praised in his drunkennes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shoote his good Counsellors
child, through the hart with an arrow? Besides a great number of mischiefs
wrought only for wicked praise. And hath not priuat profit also, to the hurt
of many bin esteemed, and that of such that ought chiefly to haue abhorred
it? Yes I trow: for BAALAM the Prophet of God, through greedy gaine, did
curse the people of God: IVDAS one of CHRISTS Apostles, for priuat
profit did betray CHRIST his maister: what made ALEXANDER go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to conquer the whole earth, but a priuat co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie and a regall rule to
himself? What cities haue bin betraied? what cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sumed? what peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
spoyled and murthered, what pouerty vnhoused, what right peruerted,
what townes decaied, how many periured, what widowes wronged, what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlesse
defrauded, and what poore oppressed? and al for priuat profit? These
are the blossoms that such brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches do beare, these are the floods that flowe
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such fountaines, and these are the grapes that grow on such grafts. But if
this selfe pleasure (which hurteth many &amp; doth good to none) were chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged
into godly pleasure which helpeth other though it hinder it selfe: and if wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
praise, which maketh truth be oft troubled, and much wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to be win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
at, were altered into honest and godly report, which iudgeth vprightly,
and fauoreth no falshood: and if priuat profit, which vndoeth many to make
a few riche, were turned into common commoditie, that enricheth many
and impouerisheth none: then many displeasured should liue in quiet, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that want should then haue enough, and thousandes that are wronged
should then haue their right. Which godly chaunge (most meete for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians)
is smally preferred, not much procured and a great deale lesse practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
Yet the <hi>Ethnikes</hi> (not knowing the gaine of godly life as we do) so much
did preferre the pleasures of other before their owne, honest praise aboue
other riches, and publike welth before their owne profit: that it is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to heare, straunge to be tolde, and hard to be credited. CVRTIVS to
pleasure the Romaines, in ceasing the infectious fume, left all his owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
lept into a stinking pit, and so died him selfe: MVTIVS SCEVOLA
to profit his owne Citie, did burne his arme stoutly with a couragious hart:
ZOPIRVS to come in credit with the Babylonians his enemies, did cut off
his owne nose, eares, and lippes, whereby being made Captaine of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,
did after deliuer the same to DARIVS his Lord &amp; maister: PHILIP
<pb facs="tcp:10199:3"/>
king of Macedon, father to ALEXANDER the great, esteeming equity &amp;
honest praise before his owne priuate profit, gaue to a certaine man, so much
money out of his coffers, as by wrong vndaduised iudgement he gaue from
the same: AGESILAVS preferring the profit of his subiects (the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians)
before his owne gaine, did giue all king AGIS treasure among
the poorest of them.</p>
            <p>Now seing these <hi>Ethnickes</hi> and many mo, with the losse of their liues, the
dismembring of themselues, and with their liberall gifts, haue shewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
by their deedes, rather Christians than <hi>Ethnickes,</hi> making pleasure,
praise, and profite, three vertues: then these Christians, that hurt and displease
other, to pleasure and profite themselues, do shewe by their deedes, that they
are rather <hi>Ethnickes</hi> than Christians, turning pleasure, praise, and profite, into
three vices, whereof there are no small number. But that pleasure, prayse, and
profite, were vsed as they ought (not as they are) I haue with some paines and
studie facioned and framed, not onely of late a worke for that purpose, called
<hi>To good to be true,</hi> but also now newly compiled and finished a Seconde parte
thereof. Wherby it may appeare if my will were to my wishe, the same three
frequented vices, should be changed into three vnaccustomed vertues. But
seing I can not performe it, I would faine procure it: and therefore for that
I can not profite my countrie with my purse, as I wishe: yet I meane to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
the same with my penne, as I may. Which Booke, as it is not to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
among common giftes, so I do not giue it as common giftes are giuen.
For common giuers appoint the receyuers of their giftes, before their giftes
be bought: but I haue made my gifte before I appointed the receyuer. And
whereas they chuse a meete gifte for their receyuer: I haue chosen a meete
receauer for my gifte. And that is your Honour: allured thereto through the
common fame of your great wisedome, affabilitie and clemencie. Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
vnto you: that I haue dedicated it to your Honour, not to rewarde me,
but to know me: and not to do for me, but to thinke well of me. And though
this gifte is to simple for you to receyue: yet it is the best that I am now able
to giue. Trusting you will not respect the workeman but the worke, not
the pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning but the meaning, and not the defect but the effect. The Methode
and meaning whereof, is plainely described in the Epistle of the first parte:
whiche if you haue not seene already, then I beseech you at leasure to peruse
the same. And if your Honor shall take in good parte this my simple gifte:
I shall thinke my selfe better recompenst, than if I had a bountifull
rewarde of many other. Thus ceassing any further to trouble
your Honour: I wishe you here a prosperous long life,
and an endlesse life in the kingdome
of Heauen.</p>

for their giftes farre aboue their expectation,
as the poore Cobler was of the Emperour <hi>Augustus</hi>
for his Crowe, by an extraordinarie meanes when all hope was past. Which pleasant
example is this: A poore Cobler brought vp a Crowe with great trauell and paine to
make him speake these wordes, <hi>All haile woorthy Caesar and victorious conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi>
(which was immediatlie after he ouercame <hi>Anthoninus</hi>) whiche birde was so
dull of learning, that he did beat hir cruellie, and in beating hir he saide many times
(when she would not talke as he taught hir) All our labour and charges is lost. At
last when the Crowe had hir lesson something perfectlie, the saide Cobler vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that the Emperour would come through the streetes, wayted purposely therefore,
and when the Emperour came by him, the Crowe by and by (hauing some priuie war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
when to tell hir tale) suddenly vttered, <hi>All haile woorthie Caesar and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
conqueror:</hi> wherof the Emperour made small accompt, saying, I haue such Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luters
inough at home (for he had birdes giuen him before that could speake the
same woordes,) and as soone as the Emperour had saide so, The Crowe answered (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to the expectation of the Cobler) <hi>All our labour and charges is lost.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
the Emperour smiling, he then gaue more to the sayd Cobler for that Crowe, than
he gaue for any other birde before: though by the Emperours first woordes he was
without hope of any thing. Among which number of giuers I accompt my selfe, for
as the poore Cobler had brought the Emperour a Crowe not trained vp without tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
to pleasure him, without hope of any rewarde therefore: so I haue presented to
you a Booke, (not pende without paine) to pleasure and profite you, being vtterly in
dispaire, to be gratified therefore of euery one with my wished rewarde, (though it
be not much that I craue for the same) for though the Cobler gaue his gifte for a
great rewarde but to one: I haue giuen this my gifte for a small rewarde to many.
(which is, good will and thankes). But if this my Booke declare vnto you a profitable
extraordinarie talke, as the Crowe vttered to the Emperour a pleasant extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
tale: I trust you will as willingly giue me great thankes for my Booke, as the
<pb facs="tcp:10199:5"/>
Emperour gaue the Cobler a riche rewarde for his Crowe, which if you should not do,
I then should be inforced, to saie with the Crowe, <hi>then all my trauell and labour
is lost.</hi> But so to say, I hope I shall not be driuen, for I doubt not, but that many will
therefore thanke me: though some should vncortuouslie discommende me. Such as
rewarde good giftes with deprauinges and detractions, are not of so good nature,
as this woorthy Emperour <hi>Augustus</hi> was: who on a time when a cert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ine Greeke had
giuen him a fewe fine verses, (hoping thereby to haue some good rewarde) The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
then with his owne hand, wrote very apt verses in Greeke, and sent them to
the sayde man (comming towardes him) and so the Emperour gaue him verses for
verses. Thus such ought to learne at <hi>Augustus,</hi> to gratifie their giuers of Bookes,
with writing againe as good, or aswell as they can, or at least to thanke them and not
to detract or deride them. But as the sayde learned man politikely, to allure the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
to giue him a rewarde, did take out of his purse a fewe pieces of siluer, and did
offer them to the Emperour for his verses that he gaue him, saying: It is no rewarde
for your estate (worthie Emperour) but if I had more, more would I giue: wherewith
the Emperour called his purse bearer, and commaunded a thousand markes forthwith
to be giuen him. Euen so if any should do, (as many haue done) write and set forth
Bookes, for my commoditie: if I could not rewarde them with my purse, I would (as I
haue done) thanke them with my tonge, whereby I would learne and allure them to
gratifie me and such other with the like. And now for that many did well accept and
thankefully take, my Booke called <hi>Too good to be true,</hi> I haue the rather, newly
framed &amp; published the Second part therof, called <hi>The knitting vp of Too good
to be true:</hi> which I haue onely done, to please, pleasure, and profite many, and
not to displease, displeasure, or disprofite any. Crauing (most gentle
Reader) nothing of you therefore, but good will for my gift, loue
for my labour, and thankes for my trauell: which is more
easie for you to giue vnto me, than for me to make
this that I haue giuen vnto you. And thus I
wishe you as well as my selfe.</p>

               <p>The faithful man can neuer want foode, nor the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

               <p>That is very like, but my fayth is so firme, that God

               <p>Nay rather by Gods good prouidence so mercifullie:

liuing and eternall GOD, the maker of Heauen and Earth.
<hi>Theramines</hi> did attribute his woonderful escaping from death,
when all his couuiuants were killed with the fal of the house,
where they were with him, but onely himselfe, who though he
shoulde haue thanked God for miraculously sauing of his lyfe,
he applied it to blinde Fortune, which neither didde nor coulde
saue his lyfe,<note place="margin">The foolishe saying of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramines.</hi>
                  </note> crying out aloude on this manner: <hi>O Fortuna cui

                  </hi> Such was his blindenesse that serued such
a blinde God: for though his woonderful and miraculous esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
from death, contrarie to all hope and expectation, shoulde
haue dryuen him to the knowledge of God, and to the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente
of his wicked and tyrannicall lyfe: he like a brute beast
had no suche consideration, but therevpon tooke an occasion to
thinke that his blynd God Fortune had preserued him to work
some greater wickednesse, crueltie and tyrannie than he hadde
done before. These are the Berries that such Brambles doe

But séeing you are desirous to knowe howe I did for meate in
the wilde Wildernesse, I will shewe you. You knowe that
when I went from you it was almoste supper time, especially
for him that had not then dyned: but as soone as I was depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from you, I was so troubled with two sodaine suters, that
their balling and calling on me didde no lesse wearie mée, than
my painefull and fast trauelling in the Wildernesse didde tyre
mée.</p>

               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>I maruell that you shoulde be troubled with suters
in the Wildernesse, for you may goe twentie dayes there still
forwarde, before you shall sée eyther man, woman, or chylde.
But if you had anye such suters, rather than they should haue
troubled mée, I woulde haue dyspatched them and sente them
packing.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>Yea, but what if you could not graunt them their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>Then I wold haue sent them away without, euen as

not be answered with reason.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, they were so importunate, that they would
haue no nay.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>But tell me one thing: Were their requestes such,
that you were able to graunt?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>The one of them I could haue graunted very easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
but the other very hardly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>Then would I haue satisfied him with the easier
suite presently, and the other when I might at laisure and at
tyme conuenient.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>I but the graunting of the one would haue bene a
hinderance to the other.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>Would it so? then I would haue desired them to
depart gently, if not, I would haue made them go away by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, they were such strong and importunate su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that neither gentlenesse could entreate them, reason per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
them, nor force could feare them: and to say truth, they
did so hold me and gripe me, that with all the strength I had, I
was not able to fling them from me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>They were very strange suters, I thinke very long
vntill I heare who they were.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>Seyng you are so desirous, you shall knowe. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth,
the one of these suters was myne Eyes, the other was my
Stomacke.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>Are these the Suters you ment off? you are a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt
man, They are such Suters in déede that must not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
and to say truth, whom you are loth to deny.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>If I deny the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is bicause I am not able to graunt
them, they cannot so soone demaund, but I am as willing to
performe, especially if it lie in my power.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>I beléeue you right well. If Princes, Rulers, Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and other (that are able) were as desirous to graunt poore
Suters their néedfull and reasonable requests, as you are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
(yea when you are scant able) to performe these your Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
demaunds, then many poore Suters should not sue so long
<pb facs="tcp:10199:7"/>
in vaine as they do, nor yet go home without peny or purpose.
But I pray you what did these your importunate Suters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>Forsooth mine eyes desired me to go to bed, and my
stomacke earnestly required me to go to supper.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>The tyme and place considered, I thinke you were
more able to performe the request of your Eyes, then to graunt
the request of your Stomacke.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>Be bold of that, yet eche of them did plead their case
so reasonably, and defended the cause so cunningly, that I could
not well tell to whome I might encline. Mine Eyes requested
me moste earnestly to laye me downe to sléepe, saying, though
you haue no trim chamber to lye in, be content with the ground
which your first father Adam was conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to take for his couch:
And though here be no house nor roofe to defend you from cold,
yet the Aire is here so temperate, that you can féele no cold: and
yet your lodging is not without a trimme &amp; goodly roofe,<note place="margin">A sure roofe.</note> which
is the heauens of Gods owne making, which you are sure will
not fall downe and hurt you, though the roofes made by men
might fall downe and kill you. And as for a fether bed care not,
for here is grasse and mosse wheron in this your necessitie, you
wil sléepe as soundly,<note place="margin">A preaty plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> as though you had the best bed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world.
And then my Stomacke said: Sir, I beseech you consider, as it
is méete to graunt sléepe to your Eyes, so it is more méete to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
meate for your Stomacke, which of vs two you may best
spare, let him be last serued. You may liue if you had no Eyes,
but you must néedes perish if you had no Stomacke: &amp; you may
well liue though you haue Eyes and sée not, but you must néeds
die though you haue a Stomacke and féede not. And as your
Eyes perswadeth you to be content with the grasse and mosse
for your bedde, so in this great necessitie it is very simple foode
that will not satisfie me, and be pleasaunt vnto you. Then the
Eyes replied agayn: My liddes are so heauy that I cannot kéep
them open, and you sée it beginneth to be darke, whereby I can
stand you in small steade, for if I were as willing to wake, as
I am desirous to winke, you should be sure to wander wrong:
<pb facs="tcp:10199:8"/>
therfore you were better here to sléepe quietly, then to wander
you wot not whether daungerously, marry if you were as sure
to gette some foode for your Stomacke, by trauelling in the
dark, as you are sure to gette a swéete nap, by lying here in the
darke, I woulde not so earnestly perswade you. Then my sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke
aunswered: Sir, wey not these wordes, if you graunte
them sléepe, then I shal lacke my Supper, and be a great while
without meate: but if I haue my supper, your eyes shal not be
long without sléepe, naye thereby they shall be sure to haue the
more sléepe. Then sayde the Eyes verye vehemently, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myditie
of your braine is so muche, that vnlesse it be exhausted
by sléepe, I shal neuer be able to holde them open to directe you
in your way. Then sayde the Stomacke, credite not your eyes
herein, for I haue ben so long empty, that the brayne can haue
no suche humiditie, for the fume that ascendes from the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke,
doeth make the braine moyste, now if the Stomacke
want foode, wherof the fume doth grow, then how can there be
anye suche fume, to bréede suche moysture of the brayne, and
so your braine hath no such aboundance of moysture, as your
Eyes do allege, therfore I youre Stomacke haue muche more
néede of meate, than your eyes of sléepe, naye rather take héede
of too much sléepe, for by sléeping the heate is thereby broughte
from all the externall partes, to the internal parts, whereby the
heate being maruellously encreased, wil quicklye consume the
little moysture within you, and so the radical moysture will be
in daunger to be extinct, and then farewel life: and thus if you
graunte sléepe to your Eyes, you maye happe to bring deathe
to your self. Then the Eyes sayd, I praye you regarde not hys
wordes, they are but fables, manye woulde faine sléepe if they
might, but you will not sléepe when you maye, remember I
beseeche you, that many haue runne madde for wante of sléepe:
then my Stomacke aunswered again quickly, but a great sort
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> haue dyed for want of foode. Then my Eyes said to me ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
mourninglye, if euer you will haue me to guide you, then
graunte me some sléepe: and then the Stomacke most doleful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sayde, if euer you will haue me to féede and nourish your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
<pb facs="tcp:10199:8"/>
get me some meate. Then my Eyes said, of conscience it is
nowe time to sléepe, for it is almoste midnighte: then my Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke
aunswered, midnighte is not to late for him to Suippe,
that hath neither eate nor drunke of thrée or foure dayes. And
thus I was so troubled with these two earnest suters, that I
coulde not well tell to whom it was beste to yéelde, but weying
with my selfe the greate daunger I was in, for want of foode,
I fully consented to my Stomacke: and thoughe it was verye
darke, whereby my eyes coulde doe me no greate pleasure, yet
God did presentlie helpe me, to whom I praied to succour me,
for immediatelie my foote did happen into a hoale, wherein I
founde yong Rabbets, whiche I prepared as wel as I could,
and so I played the Cooke, and roasted them for my Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>But I pray you, how did you for fire to rost the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Truely fire was more easie to get than meate, and
drinke was more easie to gette than fire: but breade to eate my
Supper withal, was the hardest to come by of all: for it was
impossible to haue anye in the Wildernesse, vnlesse GOD
hadde sente it from heauen, as he rayned <hi>Manna</hi> for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

breade, and yet I thought, I neuer fared better in all my

               <p>No that is true, but I had suche a pleasaunt sauce to

I founde a fewe egges, but what egges they were, I knowe
not (yet they were very like the egs of a Turkey Hen) which,
when I had founde, I was very desirous to roste, or to séethe
for my dinner, whych there by no meanes I coulde do, for there
was neither wood, nor any other thing wheron to make a fire.
And thoughe I was extreame hungry, yet I was very loth to
eate them rawe: but as I walked forwarde, thoroughe Gods
prouidence, I spyed a little shedde, wherein I founde quick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

lime vnquenched, whereof I was not a little glad, for therein
I knewe that I might roste my egges (hauing water) of which
lime stones I tooke a good quantitie, and caryed them to a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
side that was not far from thence, which stones I sprinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with water, and then they waxed very hot, as daily practise
doth proue: amongst whych lime stones I laid my egges, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
were well rosted, and that very quickly, throughe the great
heate of the saide limestones, whych the water that I sprinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

foe, for Water is an vtter enimie to Fire, for they are of clean

colde and moiste, yet Fire could not shew his force or strength
whyche lay hid in the saide lime stones, vntill Water, whiche
was his enemie, was cast vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, yet thogh therby he shewed

               <p>Bycause the Pope, as I doe vnderstande (who hathe

Christes vickar, whiche being so, then Christ muste néedes be

be his Parson, and therfore in the Popes Uicarage Christ
ought to haue a Personage: And so, if the Popes Uica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
be greate, large, and riche, then I doubte not but that
Christes Parsonage is as great and large, and also by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
ought to be as riche or rather richer. Wel, what year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gaine, profite, and commoditie Christe hath hadde out of
this his greate Personage I knowe not, but the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
profites, commodities, and the yearely treasures, that
the Pope hathe hadde by this Uicarage I knowe. For the
greate yearely rentes for his possessions belonging to the

maruellous Masses of money for Pardons, bothe for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
fornications, and all other offences, the great coffers

for licencing Priestes to kéepe Concubines and Harlots,
(but in no wise to marry) suche yearely reuenues called

was here on erth, if he had the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Parsonage, it was no such
as was correspondent to the Popes Uicarage, for, if it had
bin but the hundreth parte so profitable, so commodious, &amp;
so great as the Popes Uicarage, he shoulde not then haue
néeded to be so pore, nor his Apostles so beggarly. But it is
very wel knowen, that if Christe were then a Parson, his
Parsonage was so smal, that it was not able to maintaine
a Uicar, especially suche a sumptuous Uicar as the Pope
is. And moreouer, if Christ had then any Parsonage, I am
sure it was not at <hi>Rome:</hi> For, if he had bene a Parson, hée
was so godly, so humble, so vertuous, and so desirous to féed
his flocke, that I am sure he woulde haue gone to his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage

parishioners and flocke: and therefore bycause he wente
not thither to preach among them, he was none of their
Parson, neither had he any parsonage there, for he was not
like many of your Parsons, that woulde haue liuings and
be <hi>Nonresidents,</hi>

no Parsonage at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Uicarage that belongeth to his

Uicarage at <hi>Rome,</hi> cannot be Christes Uicar. And séeyng
he is not Christs Uicar, I know not whose Uicar he should
be, vnlesse he be the Diuels Uicar: for I am sure he thinks
scorne to be a Uicar to any meane Parson, for that he hath

               <p>Many of our parsons féed their flock a little better:
for perhaps they wil lie at their benefices 2. or 3. moneths,

               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>He fed them so wel before, that they may farrye

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>The Parson will féede his owne bellie oftener I
warrant him, for he wil be sure to eate once or twice euery
day at the leaste: for he knoweth ful well, that if his bodie
should be without food but two or thrée daies, it would be
in daunger of famishing: Then, can the Parson thinke
that the soules of his flocke can be halfe a yeare or a twelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneth
without foode, and not in danger of perishing? If
the body be sicke neuer so little, the Phisition muste be stil
with it, to giue it suche medicines as is requisite for the
health thereof: And may the soule then whiche is alwaies
sicke (for euery sinne that is committed, is a sore and sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to the soule) be without hir Phisition halfe a yeare or
a tweluemoneth, the preacher of Gods worde, whiche is
the onely medicine that healeth the sickenesse of the soule?
The soule hathe as muche néede of hir dayly foode for feare
of perishing, as the body hathe néede of meate and drinke,
for feare of famishing: Nay, the soule hathe a greate deale
more néede to be fed for feare of Spirituall death, than the
body hathe for feare of worldly death: for, if the bodye dye
for want of foode, it shall rise againe, yea and liue for euer,
if it die in Christe: but if the soule dye for want of foode, it
shall die eternally, and lie in hel which is called the second
death. Therefore these Parsons are maruellous carelesse
that féede their bodies so diligently, which must néedes die
at length for all their féeding, and suffer their soules, and
the soules of their flocke for want of féeding to dye euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stingly,

if such péeuish Parsons should be constrained, to féed their own

            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>You may bée sure of that, if that shoulde bée so, they
would be afrayd to haue one Benefice, least they should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to faste when they would faynest féede. O madde men,
more brutish than Beasts, and more senslesse than Swine, that
the loue of their bellies can make them do more for their flock,
than the loue of Christ can do, which hath shed his hearte bloud
for them, to saue them from Hel, and to bring them to Heauen.
These greate beneficed Parsons doe knowe very wel, that one
flock of Shéep is ynough, and ynough for one Shepherd to loke
too, and kéepe safely: then foure or fiue flocks are too many. For
if the Shepherd be not daily with his flocke and looke very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
to them, they will quickly go astray and be in danger to
be deuoured. Nay will not some of them myscarrie &amp; be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
though the Shepherd be still with them? yes be sure. Then
if the Shepherd haue thrée or foure flockes of Shéepe in sundry
places, he can not be stil with euery flock, for though he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
with one flock, yet two or thrée of his flocks must née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
be without a Shepherde, which shepherdlesse flockes must
néedes goe as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ray, and many of them in danger to perish. For
some of those Shéepe perish, that haue their Shepherd stil with
them: then many of them are like to perishe that haue at all no
Shepherd with them. Thus if one Shepherd be scant sufficient
for the kéeping safe of one flocke of Shéepe, then one Spirituall
Shepherd can be but sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to kéep one flock of people, which
is Chrystes Shéepe. And if it be requisite that euery flocke of
Shéep haue a Shepherd continually to loke to them, for feare of
the Wolfe: then it is much more requisite that euery flocke of
Chrystes Shéepe should haue a Spiritual Shepherd or Pastor
alwayes with them for feare of the Diuell:<note place="margin">Very true.</note> but howe can that
Parson be continually with his flock, that hath moe Benefices
<pb facs="tcp:10199:18"/>

within two or thrée moneths before the saide Gentlemans
Tenantes lease was expyred, according to the custome of

his Landlord, with a couple of Capons for a good-wil

that my lease of my farme is almost out, wherfore I come
to you, according vnto the custome, to desire you to make

custome of our countrey, I ought to make you a newe lease
of your Farme, paying to me one yeres rent for a fine ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
but you know euery Landlord may let his Farme or
ground to whom he list, so that the Farmer that dwelleth
in it doth agrée thereto: that is true, saide the Farmer, but
what meane you by that? you knowe wel ynough, said the
Gentleman what I meane thereby, for I am sure you are
not ignorant, that I haue made a lease of the Farme you
now dwel in, to an other man, and that with your consent:
sir, saide the Farmer I thinke you do but ieste, to proue my
patience withall, I had néede to knowe of it before I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to it, and it were more méete I should know the party
<pb facs="tcp:10199:22"/>
to whome I should consent, than to consent before I know
the partie. You knowe him I am sure, saide the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
you néede not make the matter so strange, he dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
not farre from you, he is a neyghboure of yours. If
anye suche, saide the Farmer, hathe hyred my house ouer
my heade wythoute my consent, hée maye bée my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure,
but he is no godlye neighboure. The trueth is so
sir, if anye hathe hyred my Farme of you, as yet I ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knowe who it is, neither haue I consented to anie
suche thing. Then saide the Farmers Landlorde, I am
sure, that I haue lette youre Farme: and I am certaine,
that you haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sented to the letting of your Farme: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you were druncke or no when you consented to it, I
knowe not, but he was sober inoughe to whome you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
I am sure. Wel, saide the Farmer, all this youre
talke is Hebrewe to me, for I knowe not what it meaneth:
Yea but, said the Gentleman, you shal finde it your owne
Countrey spéeche when you féele what it is: goe your way,
you get no Lease of me, when your Lease is expyred, then
you shall knowe who it is that hired it: you knowe full
well who hathe hired it, but that you liste to dallie and

that you worke not wiles with me, for I vse nothing but
plainenesse with you.<note place="margin">Marke well.</note> Oh sir, said he, wil you degenerate
from youre good auncestors? will you goe aboute to break
the laudable customes of this oure famous Countrie, that
oure godly fore elders by great wisedome established, of
their successors continued, and now throughout our whole
Countrey practized? When I came nowe to you, I made
a full accompte, that you woulde not deny me: for who is
it, through al this our countrie of <hi>Mauqsun,</hi> that l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

King, obeyeth our lawes, estéemeth our orders, fauoureth
our fame, regardeth their owne credite, and wisheth a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
commoditie to oure Countrie, that once will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to violate or breake our commendable customes? and
wil you, being a worthie Gentleman, and of an auncient
<pb facs="tcp:10199:22"/>
house of this our countrie, contrarie to our good orders and
custome, putte out me your louing and obedient Tenant,
without any iuste cause, who with my fore-elders, haue
thus manie thousand yeares dwelled quietlie in the same?
Let neither glistering gold entice you, neither anie Fines
allure you, nor yet racked Rents procure you to do that in
an houre, that shall bring your infamie all your life. You
sée, that all your elders that neuer put oute their pore Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunts,
didde liue with worshippe, and die with fame: and
will you by putting out your pore Tenaunte, liue with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worship,
and die with shame? You knowe sir, that no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
in all the world, hathe wiser Rulers, iuster Iudges,
better lawes, nor yet better executed than we haue: you
heare of sewe that offend the lawe, but none vnpunished
that offende the lawe: therefore foresée the daunger, leaste
when you woulde you cannot auoide the danger. They that
procure you to fall, I feare can not helpe you vppe. Then
the Gentleman said, (shewing himselfe to be angrie) away
thou prating knaue, dost thou tell me my dutie? Diuines
are daintie,<note place="margin">Note this:</note> when peasaunts do preache. Sir, said the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt,
though I am too simple to preach, yet I may be able
to giue good counsel. Euery welthie head hath not wisdom
at wil, nor euerie poore fellowe is not fraught with follie:
wisedome is not alwayes tied to wealth, nor foolishenesse
is not alwaies knit to pouerty: therefore the wiseman wil
consider the talke, not the talker, but fooles regard the tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
not the talke: wherfore sir, the wiser you are, the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglier
you wil weigh my wordes. Good counsell may do
good if it be taken in time: but if it come too late it profiteth
not. And nowe, for that perhaps you haue denied mée my
Lease only to proue me, I wil not shew my selfe obstinate,
nor be stubborne to you, at whose handes I haue my chiefe
liuing: Therefore as your moste louing and obedient Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt,
I humbly beséeche you to lette mée haue a newe
lease from you of my Farme: and here againe I offer vnto
<pb facs="tcp:10199:23"/>
you for a fine, one whole yeares rent of my Farme. To
whome the Gentleman saide, get thée hence, thou shalte
haue none other lease of me than thou haste, neither will
I take thy fine, nor accepte thée long for my Tenante, and
therewith the sorrowfull tenaunte went away.</p>

               <p>But I pray you sir, did the tenant when his lease

            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>Forsooth neither, for he tarryed in it stil, &amp; would
not go out, but kept possession thereof, so that he that hyred
the saide Farme ouer his heade, complained of him to the
Iudge who was his owne sonne, thinking that he woulde

            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>It was very like so, therefore it was maruaile

            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>Yea you, and they of your Countrey may mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile

            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>That is verye like, for there haue bene Iudges
with vs ere nowe, that haue wincked at the right, and haue
fauored such as had neither right nor good title in the thing
they sued for, and yet was neither theyr father, mother, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>Then perhappes they greased them in the hands
with the golden ointment, whiche hathe as greate vertue
to allure wicked Iudges as consanguinitie or kinred. But
this Farmer, whose house was hyred from him, did assure
himselfe, that the Iudges of <hi>Mauqsun</hi> are so righteous, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and fear God so much, that neither loue of theyr kinred,
fauor of theyr friendes, nor yet bribes of strangers, coulde
make them once tread awry: besides that, he knew ful wel,
that if the Iudge shoulde weigh with the wrong, and doe
contrary to equitie and iustice, that then we haue suche a

louing, affable, diligent, and righteous King, that if anye
pore man complaine to him of wrong done to him by any
whatsoeuer he were, he woulde heare the matter himselfe,
and whether he were Lorde, Ruler, or Iudge that did the
party wrong, he should be sure to pay ful dearly for it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, without any hope of remission or pardon:
And therfore this Farmer did not feare his righteous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

truth: &amp; that I wil not take his part in wrong, to be against

otherwise I wil tel him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> law wil enforce him thereto, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
further losse whether he wil or no. Then he said to his son,
I pray you doe, &amp; let it be as quickly dispatched as maye be.
And then the Iudge immediately sent an officer for him, at
whose co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t he came by &amp; by: whom, when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudge
saw, he said, I maruel Farmer, why you do not suffer my fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
to enioy &amp; possesse y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Farm you dwel in, which he toke
of this gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, let him haue possession therein quietly &amp;
spéedily, or else he shal haue it whether you wil or no: The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Farmer was about to speake, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudges father spake
sodainly, &amp; said<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> you niyght be sure you folish fellow y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you

me,<note place="margin">A faire bragge.</note> specially seing my son is Iudge where our matter must
be determined. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Farmer answered again very sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
I know my matter is so true, and your son so vpright a
Iudge, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I am right glad, that he shal haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> determining
of my matter, though you are his father, &amp; I but a stranger
to him. What Farmer, hast y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> such a good opinon in me, said
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudge? Yea that I haue, said y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Farmer, &amp; none can make
me beleue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> either father, fauor, affection, kinred, mony, or
rewardes, can make you iudge vniustly, or deale vntruely:
then the Iudge said, y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> art not deceiued in me: therfore, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
affiance y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> hast in me, &amp; for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good wil I beare thée, yéelde vp
thy possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to my father, &amp; let him haue his right w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
&amp; I wil be a suter to him to be good to thée. Sir, said y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
Farmer, by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time that the truth is knowne, and al things
stand according to equitie, you wil not think y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
me. This is verie stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge said y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudge: if I may credite
mine own father, this honest Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tleman, &amp; these thrée sober
witnesses, y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> hast co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted &amp; agréed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my father should take a
lease in reuersio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this Gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. My Lord, said the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
as it is méete y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a man should be at his own marriage,
so it were requisite y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to mine own agréeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t:
<pb facs="tcp:10199:25"/>
and it were maruaile, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I should be so obliuious, as to put
away my whole liuing, and not to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, when, where,
nor to whom: such a thing is not so soone to be forgotten: I
might then be counted to be more forgetful than <hi>Claudius,</hi>
who in a fury, being Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> commaunded one
of his familiar friendes to be beheaded, and called for the
same man the next day to playe with him at Chesse, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had bid that he should be put to death. Wherfore,
as you are a righteous Iudge, &amp; know that the Iudge of al
Iudges is in heauen, I beséech you, not only to examin the
truth of this matter throughly, but also to separate euerye
one of these that are come against me, wherby they may not
confer any further togither tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue done, &amp; that they
heare not one anothers examination. To whom the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
father said, dost thou thinke that my son wil do so much
at thy request? no I warrant thée. Father, saide the Iudge,
be contented, if your matter be true (as you saye it is) then
your separation cannot make you disagrée in truth: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his request is both reasonable &amp; lawful: and if I should
not grant it vnto him, I should not only séeme to deale vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustly,
but also euery one might thinke I were partial, and
fully bent to do him wrong to pleasure you withall: so that
my louing father,<note place="margin">Note this.</note> be not displeased with me, for though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
you may commaunde me, yet in this case I maye
commaunde you: you muste consider, that I am nowe
two kind of persons, in respecte of my worldly birth, I am
your son, &amp; ought to obey you: but in respect of this mine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
I am your Iudge, and you ought to obey me: wherfore
I commaund euery one of you to separate your selues: and
to the intent my wil herein may be the better performed, I
commaunde fiue officers belonging to this court, to waite
on you, and to keepe euery of you so far asunder, that no one
of you shal talke with an other, neither any of you heare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
examinations of an other. Take them Officers vnto you,
and kéepe them separately vntill I call for them. Ah son,
sayde the Iudges Father, doest thou vse thy Father
<pb facs="tcp:10199:25"/>
thus extreamely? I woulde haue thoughte thou wouldst haue
handled mine enemy thus, rather tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me: father, said y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudge,
be contente, he came willinglye as soone as I sente for hym,
and here is none, neyther hath he brought any to be examined
on his behalfe, as you haue done, neyther doe I commit you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
these Officers hands as prisoners, but onelye that he maye
perceiue, I am willing, to performe his reasonable request: to
whom his father aunswered, I wil not be kept of any, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to kéepe my selfe, I woulde I had neuer begot thée,<note place="margin">An vnfit speech to a Iudge.</note> I am
sorie that I came to thée to complain. And I am as sorie father,
saide his sonne, that it is my chaunce to be your Iudge. If your
matter be right (as I now feare the contrarie) you woulde be
as wel content for my credite to graunt your aduersaries law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
desire, as that I should Iudge rightly on youre side. Then
saide the father to the Iudge, I will trouble you no further, I
and this Gentleman my Landlord, with my witnesses will be
gone, I wil haue it tryed in another Court: then said y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudge,
I coulde be right wel content that you should so do, if the Law
would permit you: but our Law is, that no maters may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
but only in that Court that is appointed therefore, &amp;
euery matter must be tryed where they are first co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menced: and
now for that you dwel within the circuit of this Court, where
I am Iudge, and séeing you haue comenst your matter here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this Farmer, you can not remoue it from hence if you
would. I maruel why you shoulde refuse to haue your matter
tried before me your sonne: for as you maye thinke, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one should here haue their right, so you may be most sure,
that I being Iudge, and your most louing Sonne, woulde not
suffer you here to take any wrong. Me thinkes this Farmer
whom you sue here (that is neither kith nor kin to me) shoulde
rather refuse to haue his matter tryed here, than you. But this
I wil doe father, for the loue I beare you, and for the greate
care I haue of you, I will giue this Farmer an hundred mark
out of mine owne purse, to let you enioy his Farme quietlye,
whereby neither you shall néede to trouble me nor the Lawe
anie further. Then the Iudges father saide churlishlie, I haue
<pb facs="tcp:10199:26"/>
no néede of thy money, I am able to paie for it my selfe: but for
that I haue agréed with him once, as my witnesses ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> testifie,
I will not giue him one pennie more than I haue done: then
saide the Farmer, if you shoulde giue me but one peny more
than you haue giuen me, then you shoulde giue me but one pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
for my good will of my Farme, for I neuer had anie of you
yet: and a pennie were to little of conscience for such a Farme
as it is, whiche is sufficient to finde me and my wife, and
thirtie persons, besides the dailie refreshing of my poore neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
and diuerse straungers: and if you woulde giue me fiue
thousand pounde for my good wil of it, yet you should not haue
it: for that I and my auncestours haue dwelled in it time out
of minde. And if I shoulde put such a good liuing away, which
my auncestours haue liued on so long, from my children, euery
one might wel say, that I am not worthie to haue such a liuing
left vnto me by my Parentes: and whereas they mighte think
that as long as I kepte it I hadde some witte, so nowe they
mighte well affirme, that I were a foole, or beganne to dote:
And therefore I haue neither putte it awaie, neither will
consente to putte it awaie. And thoughe my Landlorde be
willing to haue a new Tenant, yet I am contente to kéepe stil
mine olde Landelord: Therefore séeing I haue not offended
him anie waie, nor yet hys newe Tenaunte pleasured him
by anie meanes (that I knowe) I feare it will fall out, (if the
matter be well ripte, that either he hathe hadde some greater
Fine, than I haue offered him, or some greater Rente than I
do paie him, or rather both. Wel father, saide the Iudge, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
this man wil not depart with his Farme, vnlesse he loose
it by the Law. And for that I would haue you friends without
Law (if it might be) I beséech you father let me entreate you at
this time to be ruled with reason: what would you haue me to
do? said he to his son. Marke me and I wil tel you: you haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
ynough,<note place="margin">A vertuous Iudge.</note> though you haue not this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s Farme from him,
which if you had, I feare you woulde not kéepe the like house
on it, that he doth, therefore I woulde wishe you should release
<pb facs="tcp:10199:26"/>
your title you haue in it, from this Gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> And if you paid
anye Fine for it (whiche you may doe with the consente of the
Farmer, so that it be but one yeares Rente) I wil request this
Gentleman to giue it you againe: and this his olde Farmer
shall giue him the same Fine againe. Howe saye you Farmer,
saide the Iudge, are you content therewith? yea sir, said y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
at your request with al my heart. Then saide the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
but you were best know whether I wil take it againe of
him or not. And then saide the Iudges father, thoughe you
woulde so take it, yet perhappes I woulde not receiue my
Fine againe. I praye you father saide the Iudge, sticke not
herein: So that you haue your money you layde out for the
Fine, you néede not care: Yea marry saide he, so that I hadde
my monie that I laide out. Then the Iudge saide, hadde he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
more monie of you, than one yeares Rente? I saye not
so saide his father, and if I hadde paide him anie more, yet I
sette more by the Farme than by the Fine: yea, but father
saide the Iudge, I truste you paide him no more, than one
yeares Rente: the Gentlemanne saide, no indéede didde
he not: then the Iudge saide to the Gentlemanne, I praye
you giue my father his Fine agayne, that he gaue you: my
Lorde, saide the Gentleman, I haue it not, I haue spent it: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the Iudge saide againe, are you so contente that the Farmer
shall giue him the Fine, that he shoulde giue you? I am plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
saide the Gentleman, so that your father will make me a
generall quittaunce: no saide the Iudges father, I will make
no quittaunce, I haue hyred my Farme, and my Farme I
looke to haue: then father, said the Iudge, you are giuen more to
will, than to wisedome, and to gaine, more than to godlynesse.
Wel séeing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Farmer wil take no mony to forgo his Farme,
lette me entreate you to release vppe your Leafe: And by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I woulde haue all ended quietlye, I will gyue you
fortie pounde out of mine owne purse, so that you wyll
doe it: Whereby you maye perceyue that I woulde haue
the Farmer to kéepe hys Farme, and you to be no looser, which
<pb facs="tcp:10199:27"/>
Iudges vse not commonly to do. I wil haue none of you sayde
the Iudges father,<note place="margin">No common vse of Iudges.</note> but if the Farmer wil giue me a hundreth
pounde to release my state and title, I am content. Then sayde
the Farmer, I wil not giue one penny for it more than my or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
Fine, I wil breake no good custome of this our famous
Country. And now my Lord, for that you haue offred too much
and all for quietnesse, whiche I sée is for the tender zeale you
beare to your father, (though he cannot sée it) let the matter be
tryed before you, and he that winnes it by the Law, lette him
weare it. Are you so stoute? said the Gentleman, for my parte
let it be tryed by the Law: though you thinke my Lorde Iudge
doth fauour you, yet assure your selfe, our thrée witnesses and
we two are sufficient to ouerthrow you. I trust he will not go
against a manifest truth: no said the Iudge, but I would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
if it might be, haue the matter taken vp: yea said the Iudges
father, if the Farmers matter wer as true as my son knoweth
it is false, he woulde not be so readie to haue the matter ended
without Law:<note place="margin">Spiteful wordes.</note> at which words, the Iudge beganne to blush,
saying, wel father, this something toucheth me, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Farmer said
true, when he affirmed that you can not sée the zeale I beare
you: and now séeing you haue vrged me, let it fall out as it wil,
for the Law shall try it, and nowe you shall sée whether I will
beare with falshod or not: saying further, bring my father hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the Barre, and the Farmer also, but carrie the rest aside
vntil I call for them: and then the Iudge saide, father it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by your Bil of declaration, that such a day, such a month,
and in such a place, this Farmer receiued fortie pounde of you,
wherefore he did consente and agrée that his Landlord shoulde
let you a Lease of the Farme he now dwelleth in, and that you
shoulde suffer him, after the ende of your Lease, quietly to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse
and inioy the same. How say you father (sayde the Iudge)
is it not so? yes truely saide his father: then feare not father,
saide the Iudge (though you haue something missused me) if
this be true, you shall haue the Farme and all your desire. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
saide the Farmer, if that be true, then I will yéelde and he shall
haue it, but my Lord if I proue it false, then I trust I shal haue
<pb facs="tcp:10199:27"/>
my Farme still. Yea that you shal, sayd the Iudge, fear it not.
Sir if it will please you, saide the Farmer, to send for thrée such
of my neighbors, they will come with spéede and something sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
you in thys matter. Then the Iudge commanded an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
to goe for them, who came presently to the Iudge, and then
the Iudge examined euery of them by themselues: and they all
agréed, that the same day the said Farmer and they were al the
day aboue halfe a dosen miles out of the towne. And then the
Iudge saide to the Farmer, how say you sirra, where were you
the same day that is mentioned in this Bill of Declaration?
Forsooth saide he, I was with the saide thrée men my neibours
al the same day half a dosen miles out of the towne: and if they
haue tolde you truly, they haue saide no lesse. In déede Farmer
you and they agrée al in one. Then said the Iudge to his father,
how like you this father? Then his father saide: it was then
the next day after I am most sure therof. Then said the Iudge,
if you are no surer of the truth of your matter, than you are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of the day when this bergaine was made, I feare it will
fall out but madly on your side. I pray you confesse all where
he was the next day after mentioned in this Bill. And then the
Farmer and his thrée neighbours saide al at once, that foure or
fiue daies then together they were all at the same place in the
Countrie, making merrie at one of their friendes marriages.
Then the Iudge said, Father, if your mater end no better than
it doth beginne, it will not goe very well with you. Then his
father saide, all this can not daunt me. Trulie saide the Iudge
you like your cause a great deale better than I do. You know,
said his father, he hath but thrée witnesses beside him selfe, and
I haue other thrée witnesses beside my selfe, and the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
my newe Landlorde is the fifte, who is able therin to say
something. And then the Iudge commaunded the witnesses to
be brought before him, whom he asked if they would be sworne
to vtter the truth in a matter that he would demaunde of them.
And they with one voice saide they would: then they toke their
othes before the Iudge, at which time the Iudges father wold
haue sworne, but the Iudge would not suffer him. And when
<pb facs="tcp:10199:28"/>
the saide thrée witnesses had sworne, they plainly confessed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Iudge and all the companie, that they neuer heard the
saide Farmer consent and agrée to any such thing. Howe chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
it then, saide the Iudge, that my father doth bring you as
witnesses on his side? Forsooth, sayde they, he offered eche of vs
a good summe of monie, to beare witnesse against this Farmer
in this matter, when he should will vs: but we would take no
monie of him, saying we would receiue it of him, when we had
done him pleasure: purposing by this meanes, to saue this inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Farmer, if néed should require, from losing of his Farme,
as I hope now we do, abhorring in our consciences his wicked
practise to betray the innocent. Then the faultles Farmer held
vp his eyes to Heauen, and sayd: O Lord I thanke thée: when
I came hither, I looked to haue had none other witnesses on my
side but onely myselfe, but nowe throughe thy goodnesse, thou
haste raysed sixe witnesses to helpe me, besides a most true and
vertuous Iudge, whose father hoped to ouerthrow me, through
the helpe of his sonne, and thrée witnesses that he procured him
selfe: but thou haste broughte his owne witnesses againste
him, and they haue made him to fall, by whome he thought to
stande. Then the Iudges father hanged downe his heade for
shame, and the Iudge his sonne did wéepe euen for sorrowe:
saying, O father what a dolefull daye is this? What meante
you to committe suche wickednesse? Why didde you come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your louing sonne with such an euill and shamefull cause?
Didde you thinke that I, though I be yong, am a Foole? Or
did you beléeue that by affection I woulde be woonne and enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to doe wrong? Or thoughte you, that bicause you are my
father, you therefore should allure me to falshode? You know
that a Iudge ought to bée a father to the fatherlesse, a defender
of the innocente, a succourer of the sorrowefull, a protector of
the poore, and a helper of those that bée oppressed. <hi>Iusticia</hi> is
portrayed with a vaile before hir eyes, whereby is signified,
that true Iustice ought to bée blinde, and not to respect the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
with the eyes, but the matter with the minde. And also she
<pb facs="tcp:10199:28"/>
hath a paire of Ballances in hir hande: signifying, that as a
true Ballance doth weigh equally, so true Iustice shoulde not
weigh nor wring on eyther side, vppe nor downe, but equally,
according to truthe. Oh what a griefe is it to my heart. You
knewe full well that the matter was wrong: and I partely
smelled that it was not right. I mysseliked it when you would
haue it procéede against him in his absence: You might be sure
that when I offred to giue him monie out of mine owne purse
to let you haue his Farme, and also monie vnto you to release
your interest thereof to him (which I thought was but small)
that then I perceiued your matter would not fal out very wel.
Oh infortunate father, that doth hurste the hearte of your wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
sonne. With that his father fell downe on his knées, and
with wéeping teares sayde: O sonne, would to God I had
followed your counsel, then this shame had neuer come to me:
saying to the Farmer, Oh Farmer forgiue me, and desire my
sonne to be good vnto me: The Lorde forgiue you sayde the
Farmer, I woulde it lay in my power to release you. Then
he sayde to his sonne: O my deare sonne bée fauourable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
mée. Then the Iudge his sonne sayde, Ryse vppe father and
knéele not to mée, it is rather my parte to knéele to you: O fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when I offered and coulde haue pleasured you, then you
woulde not: and nowe that you are desirous and would haue
me to do you good, I cannot. You know we haue a seuere King,
and our Lawes are extreame and may not be broken: so that if
I should moderate Iudgement contrarie to the Law, I should
not pleasure you, but vtterly vndo my self. For though I wold
spare and fauour you, the King by his espials would heare of it;
who therefore would execute mée with al extremitie, and wold
punish you with al seueritie: and so I should bring you to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
vexation, and my self to destruction. Therfore father be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
for there is no remedie but that I muste néedes giue suche
Iudgement on you, as your offence requireth by the Law. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
my father a little aside, sayde the Iudge, and bring the
Gentleman hither.</p>

               <p>But by the way I pray you tell me, did the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>No forsooth, which you shall perceiue by the sequele:
When the Gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was broght to the bar before the Iudge,
the Iudge loked on him as pleasantely as he coulde, and sayde,
sir I am sorie that this foolishe Farmer hath both troubled this
Court, you, and my father, with such a vaine matter, for I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
by the witnesses, my father, and you, that he consented to
the making of my fathers Lease by you, though he wil not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirme it: But will you tell me truely of one thing that I
shall aske you, sayde the Iudge: to whome the Gentleman aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
Yea sir that I will if I can: But do not fable with mée
sayde the Iudge, for if you should make a lie to me in this case,
therby you should incurre no smal danger by the Lawe, if it bée
knowne: therfore before you speake aduise your self wel: Were
you presente, or did you heare this Farmer, when he consented
&amp; agréed that you shuld make my father a Lease of his Farme?
Wher at the Gentleman mused, and stayde and sayde nothing:
Then the Iudge saide, I perceiue you followe my counsell, for
you take good aduisement before you speak. Though I bad you
be aduised what you saye, yet my meaning was not that you
should say nothing, and not to speake at all: Why doe you not
answere to my demaunde? If you be sure that you hearde him
speake it, what néed you feare to say so? If you did not, then tel
me accordingly. But all this whyle the Gentleman would say
neuer a word. It seemeth sayd the Iudge, that this my question
doth driue him to a narowe strait, for he thinks if he should say
that he heard him not speak it, and my father and the other wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
should before affirme the contrarie, then he should bring
a great suspition to his matter: If he shoulde affirme that hée
heard him speake it, and they before denied it, then he should be
punished by the lawe for a Liar. Gentleman, Gentleman, said
the Iudge, your being mute shewes you are driuen to a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,

This is very strange, that you are thus tong tied so sodainely.
Where some marre their matter with speaking too much, you
<pb facs="tcp:10199:29"/>
meane to amende it by holding your peace and saying too little.
Wel, seeing you wil not aunswere me, I wil no further trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
you therein. I perceiue you did not heare him speake it:
whiche you are as loth to vtter, least you should proue them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
which hath confest it, as to tel a lie, for feare of your owne
punishment. They needed not to haue called you for a witnesse
herein, for they were foure besides you, and fewer are sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
for the trial of truth be the Lawe, yet it had bene most requisite
that this Farmer shoulde haue consented to your selfe, for the
making of a Lease to my father, considering you coulde not do
it without his good wil and agréement, wherein I must néedes
say there was a great ouersight in you. But their witnessing of
the matter is sufficient, whereby your Lease must néedes be
good that you made to my father: but though before you woulde
not aunswere by demaunde, yet I beséech you to graunte this
my request: what is that? saide the Gentleman (being wel co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

with the Iudges pollitike words) forsooth said y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudge,
this Farmer I perceiue doth mourn, for that he feareth he shal

fathers good wil, that he shall haue it againe, I beseech you doe
so much at my request, as to make him a lease of the same, &amp; he
shall pay you your due Fine therefore, and so you maye repaie
my father his fine againe: Wherat he sée<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

was, and paused a good while, and at length saide: I am verye
loth to doe it, he deserueth but small fauour at my hande, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
haue you anie suche cause to speake for him, considering
he knewe that youre fathers lease was made with his consent,
and yet refused your bountiful offer, saying that he woulde not
yéelde his good will therein (whiche as appeareth was as good
as nothing) for fiue thousand pounde, though now he is like to
lose it for a great deale lesse: wherefore I beséech you perswade
me no further therin, for he shal neuer haue it. Wel seeing you
wil not do so much for my sake, saide the Iudge, I must néedes
thinke my self the lesse beholden to you, the thing is your own,
you may do what you wil, I cannot compell you: but hereof
<pb facs="tcp:10199:30"/>
I am sure, if you coulde be as wel contente to take him for
your Tenant, as he is to accepte you for his Landlorde, you
would not put him from it: and to say trueth, in my hearing he
hath curteously vsed himself towards you, and before as I am
credibly informed, wherby you haue no cause to be so ernest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him. You know that none can giue you a greater Fine
nor more Rente than he doeth, and therefore there is no reason,
why you should be so desirous, to put forth your olde auntiente
and honest Tenaunt,<note place="margin">No reason in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede.</note> for a new Tenant, without any commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie,

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
if you were his Tenaunte in this case, and he were your
Landlord, would you be content that he shoulde turne you out
of his house, and let it to another? I thinke you would not: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as you would not haue Christ to turne you out of his house
in Heauen,<note place="margin">Good counsel.</note> so turne not this your poore Tenaunt out of youre
house on earth. Though I woulde graunte it him, saide the
Gentleman, I thinke your father woulde not release his right
therein: I tolde you before, saide the Iudge, that I had gotten
my fathers good will therein, therefore if you will graunt him
your good will, I shoulde thinke my self much bound vnto you:

I wil be aduised th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>in, it maye be that hereafter vppon some
better consideration, I may be allured, but as yet I will not.
Now sayde the Iudge, that you haue giuen me a full answere,
I know wheretoo to trust: but séeing you thinke you haue done
with me, I muste procéede further, for I haue not done with
you. Bicause you are so straight laced against your honest Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and that you are so desirous to haue my father your Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt,
and to put him out, it is impossible but something doeth
driue you to do it: for as I said before, if you haue no gret Fine
nor more Rent for it, than you had of this man, there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to lead you to change your honest known Tenant, in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
you can finde no fault (as you confessed before) for a straunger

it was spoken before too manie now to be hid. Therfore tel me
truely, and lye not, for if you do, you shal pay for a double lye,
which wil be smal to your ease: what Fine did my father giue
you to make him a Lease? nay, speake the truth and shame the
Diuel, the sum was too great for you to forget: you were better
tel truth &amp; to auoide the danger of lying, than to tell a lye, &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse

great sigh, and said nothing. Gentleman, said the Iudge, your
holding of your peace is as good as a gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, say either yea or nay,
for I am indifferent: but this I tel you before, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Fine is confest

but séeing he hath confest he didde giue it, I wyll also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
I receyued it. Howe muche was there of it saide the
Iudge, forsooth it was two hundred pounde in gold, said he: but
<pb facs="tcp:10199:31"/>
if I had thoughte your father woulde haue kept his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
no better, he shoulde neither haue had my Farme, nor I
woulde haue had his Fine. I doubt that this great Fine, sayd
the Iudge, went not without enhauncing of the Rent, I praye
you therefore tell me truely, shoulde not my father haue paide
you more Rent, than this your Farmer doth: no truely, sayde
the Gentleman, and if you will not truste me, I haue the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpaine
of the Lease, here to shewe: and with that, he toke out
of his bosome the Lease and shewed it to the Iudge, wherein
there was no more Rente to be paide, then the auntiente and
olde Rente, whiche the Farmer confest to be true: and then the
Iudge, espying the ende of a Paper sticke out of his bosome,
which was by the meanes of taking out his Lease,<note place="margin">The hanging out of a Paper brought out the truth.</note> saide to the
Gentleman, what writing is that, that hangs out of youre bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some:
doth not that writing belong to your bargaine? at which
time he durst not aunsweare for feare of lying, let me sée it I
pray you? saide the Iudge: whereto the Gentleman was verye
loth, but there was no remedie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Iudge woulde néedes see it:
which when the Iudge had redde, he saide to the Gentleman:
here is a great Bil of debt, it séemeth hereby that my father o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
you a greate deale of money, but I feare either you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
or wil not tel wherfore he doth owe it you. This is a verie
straunge debt that is one &amp; xx. yeares a paying: I pray you tell
me, wherfore doth my father owe you thus muche as is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in this Bill? the summe is not so smal, but that you maye
wel remember what you sold him for it. Well séeing you will
not speake, I smell wherfore it is: Farmer, saide the Iudge,
what Rent didst thou paye to this Gentleman euery half yere?
forsooth saide he, I payde tenne Crownes at euery halfe yeare:
and at what dayes, sayd the Iudge, did you paie youre Rente?
Truly, sayde the Farmer, at Michaelmasse, and at the Annun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
of <hi>Marie</hi> the Uirgin. Nowe I perceiue I gest truely,
saide the Iudge, for it is manifeste hereby, that this great Fine
went not without enhauncing of the Rent, for, as much Re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as
is to be paide by the Lease euery half yere, so much, and euerye
halfe yere, at the same dayes and times during the Lease, is to
<pb facs="tcp:10199:31"/>
be paide by this Bil: which apparantly sheweth, that this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
hath rackt his Rent as much more as it was. It is not
for nothing, that the Cat winketh when both hir eyes are out:
so here it appeareth what was the cause that you and my father
were so loth to vndoe your bergaine and graunt. If this great
Fine and this raising of the Rente hadde not bene, you woulde
not haue bene so earnest against this your Farmer, neither yet
would you haue denied me my request as you did: but now to
be plaine with you, wheras you thought that this Farmer was
ouercome and vanquished by your witnesses, and that he should
lose his Farme, it is fallen oute cleane contrarie, for the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
that you brought to confounde him, haue condemned
you, through Gods good prouidence. Therfore that, that I did,
was by policie, to make you beleue you had ouercom this Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
to fetch you further in and to see how you would haue vsed
him if you had preuailed. Your denying of my request hath gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
you nothing: for if you had gently enclined to my desire, &amp;
béen willing to shew this Farmer fauor at my request (though
he stode in no such néede of it) perhaps I would not haue sifted
you so néerees I did. Thus you may learne, that the graunting
of a trifle at some time,<note place="margin">It is true.</note> is better than perfourming of a weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
matter at another time. And nowe though you meante mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
to your Farmer: God hath tourned it and muche more to
your selfe. You thought to haue vndone him by enriching your
selfe, but you haue not hurt him, but shamed and empouerished
yourself. Though my fathers couetousnesse made him offer you
such a Fine: yet you should haue had more wit, than to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
the same. O sir, saide the Gentleman, there was a great
fault in him, bicause he did offer it: then said the Iudge, as great
a fault was in you, bicause you did take it. Then he said again,
If he had not offered it, I should not haue taken it. To whome
the Iudge saide againe: And if he had thought you woulde not
haue receiued it, he would not haue proff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed it. You are a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
and as I vnderstand, of good knowledge and learning,
whereby you shoulde rather haue counselled him to goodnesse,
than consented to him in wickednesse. O sir, saide the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb facs="tcp:10199:32"/>
it was long ere I would yéeld vnto him, and I tolde him
all the daunger of it. Then sayd the Iudge, you haue bewrayed
your own follie: héerby it appereth that you were in more fault
than he,<note place="margin">Marke this.</note> that knew the dangers, and did fall into those dangers:
a foule shame it were for one to giue another warning of a pit,
and to fall into the same pit himself. He committed that euil to
which he enticed you: but you committed that myschief, which
you aduised him to shunne. Then the Iudge called for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be brought before him, and when his father came, the
Iudge sayde: O what an infortunate sonne am I, that must be
enforst to giue iudgement against mine owne father? natural
affection willeth me to pleasure my father: but the obedience
to my Prince doth persuade me to punish my father. I am so
wrapt in the net of necessitie, that there is no way to auoid the
mischief. If I giue iudgement on this Gentleman as he doth
deserue, and saue my father from that he deserueth: then I shal
not onely be a partiall Iudge, and so a false Iudge: but also I
shall therby procure mine own confusion. If I giue true iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as a iust Iudge ought to do, then many wil detract mée &amp;
speak euil of me, yea and when they sée me goe in the stréet, wil
point at me, saying: Behold the wicked and hard-harted sonne,
that gaue cruell iudgement against his owne father. Well, of
two euils the least is to be chosen, I were better to please God,
and obey my Prince in iudging truly, than to auoid slanderous
reportes of the witlesse by iudging vniustly. O how loth I am
to do that I am enforst to do. And with that, this yong &amp; notable
Iudge began to wax very pale, and so swounded and fell out of
his chaire, whome euery one then present thought to be dead.</p>

I would say that they meant wel, and that they did it for
a Common wealth, if they did sell then their corne and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
by the same price (or cheaper) as the other sold theirs that
first serued the markets, or that were driuen to sel soon, to serue
their necessitie. But bicause they sel them dearer, it is manifest
that they kéep their corne and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities so long vnsold, rather
for their own gaine, than for the commoditie of their Countrie.
Such an enormitie would not be suffred with vs.</p>

               <p>With all my heart. I heard it credibly tolde, that a
noble man with vs of great fame, of good report, and generally
welbeloued, had a certaine Tenant, who though he hadde his
Farme without Fine, and by the olde Rent, yet prospered but
meanely ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:10199:34"/>
more gréedie than godlie,<note place="margin">An excellent example of a good Landlord</note> and more couetous than charitable,
that went to the owner of thesame Farme: who when he came
to him, saide: It may please your Honour to vnderstande, that
you haue a Farme in such a place, and such a man dwelleth in
it, if you will be so good as to let mée be your Tenante, I will
giue you thus much for a Fine. I can not lette it vnto you, sayd
the owner of the Farm, for there is a Tenant in it alredy, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
I would be loth to put out. Sir, said the fellow, he is a very yll
husband, and he doth not thriue on it: &amp; surely I thinke he either
doth not pay you his Rente, or else shortly I feare he wil not be
able to pay it. Trowest thou so? said the Lord of the Farme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
he is an il husband, for he hath his Farme cheape ynough.
Wel, said the Nobleman, come to me such a day, and I wil the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
talk further with thée. And so the same Caterpiller that desired
his neighbours Farme departed. After which the said Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
sent for his Tenant, to whome he said when he was come
to him: sirra I vnderstand that you are a very ill husbande, and
can not thryue on the Farme that you haue of me. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
that you do not pay me my Rent: and that within a while
you will not be able to pay it, you runne so farre behinde hand.
I beséech your Honour, said the Tenant, to credit no further of
me than I deserue: the truth is, &amp; I must confesse, that I haue
not much prospered on it, but the same is neither through negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
nor ill husbandry: for my stock is much decresed through
the death of my Cattell, besides many other great losses &amp; hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances
that I haue had: but as for your Rent, what shift so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
I made, I thank God, I haue alwayes paide it from time
to time, and neuer haue bene behinde withal, nor I trust neuer
to be: which if you wil not credit, your Bailie, I am sure, will
not deny, but that he hath at euery Rent day receiued it. Then
saide the Nobleman, if it be so as you say, I am the more glad.
I am sure you payde no Fine for it, neither haue I raised your
Rente, therefore it would gréeue me if you should not thriue on
it, especially through euil husbandrie. As for losses otherways,
as the death of your Cattel and other casualties, you must be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

and giue God thanks therfore: God can &amp; will prosper you

better when it pleaseth him: wherefore take paciently &amp; thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
what he doth send, for pouertie and riches come both from
him. And if you decay or be empouerished, so it be not by your
own follie, you shal not want aide of mée, therfore play the good
husband. The Lord saue your life, said his Tenant. Then sayd
the Nobleman: thou maist sée I haue dealt well with thée, for I
haue bin offred roundly, to displace thée, which some would not
haue refused. And bicause thou shalt be sure this is true, come
such a day to me, and thou shalt heare more: but be of good chéer,
for neither monie nor frendship shall allure me: &amp; sée thou faile
not to be with me as I haue apointed thée. Wherwith his pore
Tenant was faine, and went merily away.</p>

but before the gréedie Fine-offrer came, the poore Tenant was
placed priuily behinde a cloth, where he might heare what was
said. And then the Nobleman said: welcom my frend, hast thou
brought me the monie that thou offredst me for a Fine for my
Farme? to whome he gladly answered, Yea sir that I haue: to
whom the Nobleman saide, I perceyue thou knewest I lacked
monie, &amp; so I do in déed, it could not come in a better time than
now. But I pray thée tel me one thing, is my Tenante an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrist
or an yll husband that now hath it? Yea truly sir, said he,
he is a very pore man, and far behind hand, and it is thought he
wil not in a whyle be able to pay the Rente. I tell you for good
wil &amp; as you shall finde it. If it be so, said he, I am beholding to
thée: wel, it is méet to haue witnesses at our bergaine: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
his pore Tenant came from behinde the cloth, who heard
all that was spoken: whom when the other saw, he was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
amased, thinking then that al was not well. And then the
Nobleman sayde to his Tenante, you may sée sirra that I may
haue a good fine for my Farme of this man, wheras I had none
of thée, who though he giue me a Fine for it, yet hopeth to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper

Besides that, this man telleth me that thou arte not able to
pay me my Rent: nay it should séem that it is vnpayde already.

Sir, saide the poore Tenant, I haue hearde euerie worde what
he hath said, he speaketh it rather of malice to put me out of my

he turned towards him, that offred him the Fine to put out his

who in my conscience deserue more to be hanged, than the théef

               <p>I will tell you: but firste by the way, when poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike

that it woulde be maruelous profitable for oure countrey,
to haue their Commons inclosed, they began to procure
to bring it to passe, but it séemed so hurtefull to dul heades,
for the poorer sorte and the Farmers, that they in no wise
woulde graunt vnto it, for that they had all the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
thereby, and the Lords of the soile and Gentlemen had
little or none: thinking they would haue al or the best part
from them, if they shoulde be enclosed. But the Lords of
the soile, and the Gentlemen with the wiser heades per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded
them,<note place="margin">Good counsel.</note> saying: You sée good fellowes, and our louing

you haue among you much ground and little gaine, much

greate trampling, your Commons is consumed in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
the thirde parte whereof inclosed, would haue serued

            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>No, they neuer doubted their misliking of it, for
they were sure, that their Tenauntes were so reasonable,

theyr confused Commons, that bring pouerty and

               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>Such as I am sure you wil not mislike. The diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> inclosed was on this sort: euery one according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
proportion and stint of the cattell allowed him to kéepe on
the Common, (whiche stinte was suche, as that Commons
shoulde not be ouercharged) had so muche inclosed ground
allotted and appointed to his house or Farme, as woulde
very well kéepe and finde so manye cattell moe,<note place="margin">A good distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution.</note> as he was
allowed or stinted to kéep on the Commons: as if he might
kepe ten Kine or Oxen, he had so much ground of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inclosed
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon as would kepe or finde xx. kine or oxen: &amp; if he might
kepe six horses on the Common, he had so much Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon in
pasture, as would kéepe or finde twelue horses. And if one
might kéepe an hundreth shéepe of the Common, he had so
muche inclosed Common allowed him as would very wel
kéepe and finde two hundreth shéepe: And if a poore Cotta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
myght by his stint kéepe a couple of Kine on the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
then he hadde as muche of the Commons inclosed
annexed to his Cottage, and so to remaine for euer, as
woulde kéepe or finde him foure Kine. And thus euerye
Farmer, and euery Tenaunt, Cottager and other, had so
muche inclosed grounde of the Commons allowed them
to belong to their houses and Farmes for euer, as woulde
very wel kéepe and find so many cattell moe as he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
and stinted to kepe on the bare vnclosed Commons,
and that such inclosed grounde as lay most nearest and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
to their house or Farme. And euerye Farmer and

inclosed that did belong to their Teneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and Farmes,
which before lay open and in commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: so that by this inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of their grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, they had and haue yerely, a maruelous
commoditie and profite, more than euer they hadde before.
And for that thereby their commodities were so muche en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
yerely, out of euery twentie acres of Medowe and
arrable land that belonged to any Farme, was taken and
<pb facs="tcp:10199:39"/>
reserued one acre: and out of euery tenne acres, halfe an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre:
whereof euery Cottage that had neither arrable lande
nor Medowe belonging thereto, had two acres of inclosed
Arrable land, and one acre of Meadowe inclosed, annexed
to the same, to finde the pore Tenaunt bread corne, and
Hay to succoure hys Kyne or other cattell withall.</p>

               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>Hereby it séemeth, that the Lords charges of the

            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>Their charges were not so great, but the gaines
were greater: for all the reste of the inclosed grounde that
did remain, the Lords had the same fréely to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues: whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
besides the greate profite to the Tenants, was no smal
commoditie to them. For some Lordes of the soile, hadde
within their Lordships, two or thrée thousand acres of
waste or common grounde, whereof none knewe any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
portion belonging to their house or Farme, whyche
before was little or no profite to the Lordes of the soile: but
being inclosed it was no small portion that came to theyr
share. And thus they got themselues much grounde which
they neuer hadde before: and made their Farmers and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantes

               <p>Surely this order of inclosing of the Commons
in your Countrey,<note place="margin">The commodi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie of inclosing in <hi>Mauqsun.</hi>
                  </note> is a great gaine to the Lordes, an enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the Tenauntes, an encreasing of corne, a greate
bréeding of cattell, a pathway to plentie, an augmenting of
wood, a power to your Prince, a strength to your countrey,
and a common commodity. But let me aske you one thing:
In some Lordships perhaps (where the grounde is verye
fertile) there is little or no Commons, but arrable and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe,
with smal portions of grasse ground, which are por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
appointed or limited to Farmes and Tenements: so
that there was little or nothing to spare for the Lord.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>There, euery tenant doth inclose his own grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
of their own charges: yet their landlords, if they lacke mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
do lend them mony therfore, vntil they be able to repay
<pb facs="tcp:10199:40"/>
them againe: &amp; the Landlords are so godly and good, that of
their owne costes and charges, they commonlye doe inclose
the Medow and Arrable land that is taken out of the same,
appointed to the Cotages, as is before mentioned.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>Truly it is a very godly déede, but I feare the
greatest mischiefe is behinde: for it is to be thought, that
the Lords do raise the rents of their Farmes and Houses,
to whome these new commodities do belong.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>Truste mée, these Farmers and Cottagers,
thoughe they haue greater profites and commodities than
they had before, doe paye neither Fine, neither anye more
Rent than they did. Doe you thinke that the Tenauntes
with you, could be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to haue their Commons turned
into pasture in this order, as we haue ours?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Yea I warrant you: but our Landlords, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Lordes of the Commons, will not be in haste to do as
yours do, though it woulde be a verye greate commoditie
to them. Our inclosers of the Commons are not so kinde
hearted as yours, for they muste haue all or none: manye
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue so inclosed the Commons,<note place="margin">Greedie inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers.</note> that they haue closed
themselues in, and shut all the reste out: but if they would
take ynough for themselues, and leaue parte for euery one
of theyr Tenauntes, as your inclosers of the Commons
do, manye that are nowe moste earnest againste inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the Commons, would then be vehement procurers
for the inclosing for the Commons. Surely, their insatiety
is farre contrary to true Christianitie. As the Commons
are nowe vsed: they haue nothing, and their Tenauntes
haue something:<note place="margin">Marke this well.</note> but if they coulde be content with reason,
or with lesse than all, they might haue too muche, and their
Tenauntes inough. What harme were it for them to haue

now if gifts, bribes, or (as some cal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) gentle rewards, is
one of the chiefest causes of this wickednesse, then no law can
be to seuere, for such bribed or corrupt Iudges. Oh if al Iudges
woulde wel way and consider the greate othes they take, and
the maruellous charge is giuen them, when they are made
Iudges: they would (if they had any sparke of the feare of God,
or were not vtterly determined to goe to the Diuell) abhorre
bribes, refuse rewardes, reuile the bribegiuers, nay punishe
suche offerers, heare the poore willinglie, determine their
cause spéedilye, vse no parcialitie, and giue iudgemente wyth
all equitie. Well, though some Iudges haue little regarded
this: the Iudge of all Iudges will one daye doe this. But
sir, is there no Lawe with you for them, that doe offer or giue
bribes?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>Yes that there is, and I thinke a better law than any
you haue in such case. Whosoeuer offereth or giueth any gifte
or reward,<note place="margin">For bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuers.</note> to any Iudge for anye matter depending, or after to
depende before him, shal forfeit the one halfe of al his goods, and
the Iudge to whome the gifte is offered or giuen, shall haue it
<pb facs="tcp:10199:42"/>
fréely to himselfe, if he reueale the same within a daye after.
And if he do not so reueale it, then the first reuealer or bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
therof, shal haue it. And the King shal haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If we had such a lawe with vs, &amp; so well executed as

            <sp>

               <p>We haue a law, that whosoeuer writeth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudge,

               <p>Out of al doubt this is a worthy and necessarie law:

               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber it very wel, you told it me at my first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you: surely he was a famous Iudge: if Iudges wold not
reade y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> letters, in such case sent vnto them, or winke as thogh
they had not read the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vntil they determine the matter, or passe
iudgement therof, so many matters y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue past by law on poore
mens sides, shoulde not be so long without their right as they
are. I heard a woman say with wéeping eyes, that she hadde a
matter hanged in the law seauen yeares, before it could be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and passe on hir side, and it was then eight yeares after, and
yet could not haue iudgement therof. So that she thought, yea
and saide, that one that comforted and promised hir faire, was
the chiefe occasion of hir stay from hir right: but I beléeue that
he hath spedde neuer the better therefore. A pittiful thing: if it
were hir righte by the lawe, why shoulde iudgement be staid?
and if it wer not hir right, why did the law giue it hir? Surely
before God, it is as great a fault, to kéep one from his right, as
to defraud one of his right: doth not he withold a mans right, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
wil not giue him iudgement, wherby to haue his right? At the
last day God wil not delay the time, betwéene the tryall of our
sinnes, and his diffinitiue sentence, as some of our worldlye
Iudges haue done: for as soone as he shall saye to the wicked,
<hi>When I was hungrie you gaue me no meate, when I was
thirstie you gaue me no drinke, when I was naked you clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
me not, &amp;c.</hi> And as soone as they shal say: we neuer sawe
thée hungry, thyrstie, naked, &amp;c. by and by he wil giue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on them, and wil not stay iudgement thrée or foure yeres
after, neither for letters, brybes, rings, nor for any mans plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
at which time he wil saye: <hi>Go yee accursed into euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
fire prepared from the beginning.</hi> So that hereby it
appeareth, that he wil giue iudgemente moste quickelie &amp; spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,
both on the wicked and godlye, as soone as their cause is
tryed and determined. Therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudges of the earth, wer best
to learne of Christ to giue righteous and true iudgemente, as
soone as anye cause is truly tryed by the lawe: for if Christe did
thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is necessarie &amp; good to stay Iudgement, then hée wil
<pb facs="tcp:10199:43"/>
do it. And though Christ shall haue many thousande thousande
matters to decide and iudge at the laste daye, he will decide,
ende and iudge them all in one day: but some earthlye Iudges
haue had some one matter hang before them four or fiue yeres,
and yet when it was ended, and the Lawe hath determined it,
it hath bene as long (perhappes longer or not at al) ere he hath
giuen Iudgement thereof. Manie liue not a tweluemonth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they haue begunne the Lawe, and can a man be sure to liue
a doozen yeare, to sée his matter ended? the great delayes, long
sutes, and vnreasonable expences, make manye that are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellously
oppressed and haue manifest wrong, either not to
beginne the Lawe, or throughe their importable charges,
(which they are not able to continue) are enforste to cease the
law, which their aduersaries, that maintaine themselues with
their goods, know wel ynough.</p>

of whome I hearde by the way as I trauelled hither, that was

tolde of, that boulted out the truth against his owne father, but
nothing so good as he was.</p>

               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>There was a very yong man, not very far from the
Countrie where I was borne,<note place="margin">A notorious ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ample of a dete<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stable Iudge.</note> who for his great learning, rare
wisedom, commendable conditions, and modest maners, was,
by the Magistrates and Rulers of that Countrie, chosen to be a
Iudge, who vsed him selfe for a while in his Office, so vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and so godlie, to the iudgement of euery one, that none but
were glad that they had suche a Iudge. In whose time, there
happened two Gentlemen to be very conuersant together, and
to loue one another déerly, euen as though they had bene sworn
brethren: and whiles they were in this frendshippe, the one of
them began to cast his loue an a certaine Gentlewoman, who
being a great suter vnto hir, and yet could not obtaine hir loue
as he wisht, began to languish for hir loue, and was so sad and
sorrowful therby, that the other Gentleman his déere frend, did
not onely much muse and meruaile thereat, but on a time, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
through very sorrowe to speake vnto him, he sayd thus,
or the like: Sir, I thought you had estéemd me aboue al other,
but nowe I perceiue, that you loue some other better than mée.
What occasion, saide the other, haue you to saye so vnto mée?
Haue I depraued you to anye man? you knowe my secreates
more than anye: and you haue my companie more than anye:
and these are not tokens that I loue any better than you. Wel
sayde the other, thoughe these doe argue, yet do they not proue.
Your bodie is sicke, as it is lyke, for you eate little or nothing,
your sléepe is taken from you, and your mirth is cleane gone,
<pb facs="tcp:10199:45"/>
which if they bée not argumentes that your body is sicke: then
they are manifest prouffes that your minde is not well. And if
your bodie be sicke and you hyde your disease from me, or if you
be sick in minde, and conceale the cause from me, especially fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
him that you knowe will not spare the best bloud in his body to
heale your body, nor his goodes, counsel, nor trauel, to ease your
minde: then I must néedes thinke (say you what you wil) that
you loue me not as you professe, nor estéeme mée as I deserue.
Then saide his frende againe: I knowe you loue me, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I loue you againe, and that is, as wel as my self. If you do
so, saide the other, then you ought to let me knowe what so euer
you know your selfe: vnlesse you thinke that your self will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray
your self, except you doubt your self wil deceiue your self,
and vnlesse you thinke that your self wil betray your self. Nay
that followeth not, sayd the sorowful Gentleman: for though I
loue you as my self, that maketh not that you loue mée as your
self: be not angrie I beséech you, I speake this rather to answer
your argument, than that I doubt your loue. In déede there are
very thoughtful matters in my minde, I would I had changed
them for diseases of my body. And for that I haue kepte them
close, to my great griefe, I wil nowe reueale them to you, as to
my chiefest frend, I hope to my comfort: not doubting, but that
as I tel you where my pain is, so I hope you wil procure some
plaister to ease it. Then his frende saide, both vehemently, and
as it séemed, faithfully: I protest here before God and you, if my
paines may pleasure you, or if my pursse may profit you, assure
your self of it, and loe here is my hand: if I may know the roote
of the thing that worketh you this sorrowe, I wil plucke it vp,
(and that with spéede) if al my strength be able to do it. Wel,
saide the other, seing you say so, I will no longer hide from you
the woe that doth wound me. You know that I said not long
since, that I loued you as wel as my self, but now I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
vnto you, that I loue another better than my self: yea, and
suche a one, that I feare when she knoweth it, shée will rather
frowne than fauour me, hate than help me, and cut me vp than
comfort me. If I may know hir name and where she dwelleth
<pb facs="tcp:10199:45"/>
sayde his friende, I hope I wyl find a salue that wil heale thys
sore: oh if you coulde, saide the other againe, I woulde neuer
forget your friendship. And then he vttered hir name, &amp; where
he shoulde haue hir. Séeing said he, you are in such a perplexitie
for hir, I wil not tarrie the writing of a letter, but let me haue
your Ring for a token: but I pray you first tel me, are you well
acquainted with hir? very wel, said the sorrowful Gentleman,
and she loueth me verie wel: but I feare, not so wel as to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
me. I am glad you haue told me thus much, said his friend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I wil not therfore tell hir that you are sicke for hir loue, but of
some other maladie, and desire hir to come and speak with you:
who not knowing the matter, I doubt not but I shal perswade
hir at first. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> said the sorrowful Gentleman: if I doubted no
more of hir loue, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I doubt of hir comming, I know I shold
be hole of my disease within this houre: what, saide the other,
doe you thinke she wil come so soone? yea I am sure of that, said
he, if you deliuer hir my Ring, but in any wise tell hir not that
I am loue-sicke: no I warrante you, saide the other. And so hée
went to the Gentlewoman with spéede.</p>

               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>Yea and better than he thoughte, and after as
wel as he wished: but at that time though she fauoured hym
inwardly, she shewed it not outwardly, but as one friend wold
do to another. At which time the sicke Gentleman saide: surely
Gentlewoman, I muste néedes thinke my selfe much behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to you, for this your spéedie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to me: but a great deale
more for so quickly easing me. Many Phisitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not help their
patients though they take their medicines: but you haue half
cured me without any medcine: therfore I must say, thogh your
cunning be not great, yet your luck is very good. Sir said she, I
<pb facs="tcp:10199:46"/>
haue halfe cured you without knowing your disease, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
giuing you any medicine, then it is verie like I shoulde
throughly cure you, if I knew your grief, and did minister vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you. That is very like, saide he: and séeing your phisick doth
so much ease me at the beginning of my diseases, I meane you
shal be my Doctour stil vnto the ende of my sicknesse. Sir, said
she, if only my comming without cunning can helpe you, you
shal not long lye sicke. Then saide he againe: if my seruice may
pleasure you, you shall not long lacke a faithfull seruaunte. I
thanke you for that, saide she: and therewith she gaue him hys
Ring, that he sent vnto hir. Nay, saide he, you offer me nowe
discurtesie, thoughe it be not a sufficient recompence for youre
comming, yet I beséech you kéepe it, vntil you haue a better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde:
for seeing Phisitions take as much as this of theyr pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients,
for their comming to them, though they do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no good,
then you deserue a greate deale more than this, that with thys
your once comming haue halfe cured your patient. You know
sir, saide she, that Gentlewomenne vse not to take money for
theyr Phisicke: no more doe I, said he, offer you anye, a golde
Ring is no money: and thoughe you will not take it for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
(thoughe you haue deserued it for suche a spéedie cure)
yet I beséeche you take it with you and weare it, that thereby
you maye remember to come and see your patient. I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente
with that, sayd she, so that you will take another Ryng
of me, that when you beginne something to waxe strong, you
maye remember to come and see your Phisition. I am verye
well pleased with that, saide he: and so they made a chaunge,
and one of them to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e anothers Ring, and then for that time the
Gentlewoman hys Phisition toke hir leaue, and so she depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>The best learned Doctour of them al, could not haue
eased him so spéedily, and cured him so quickely as she didde.
When he sent the Ring to the Gentlewoman, he thought she
woulde not bée so easily wonne to bee his Phisition, thoughe
he knewe hir cunning was able to cure him: I doubte not, but
<pb facs="tcp:10199:46"/>
if his Phisition plyed him as shée beganne, he was not long in
curing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>You maye be bolde of that, for the same nighte he
fel to his meate, and was so sodainely merrie, that euerie one
that sawe him, before like for to dye, so sodainely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>euiued and
most like to liue, did maruellously muse thereat. But the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that carried his Ring to the Gentlewoman, and broughte
hir with him, was not very merrie: whom the other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manne
his friende comforted as well as he could, saying: my
friende be merrie, and whatsoeuer I am able to doe for you
be bolde of me, and I will recompence your gentlenesse if I
be able, I woulde be loth you should be sicke. Then he fayned
that he was not sicke, but that his heade aked a little. The
morning next after, the Gentleman that caried his Ring, and
that fayned himselfe sicke, wente to the saide Gentlewoman:
how doth my patient? said she: verie wel, said he: you wrought
an excellent and a spéedie cure of him: I woulde to God you
coulde helpe me so quickly: what are you sick? saide the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman:
yea, said he, and therfore I am come to craue your
helpe: though I helped him saide she, more by chaunce than by
cunning: yet perhaps your disease must be helped rather by cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
than by chaunce. And I doe not thinke that you haue hys
disease: yes verily euen the very same: yet (saide she) thoughe
your disease and his be al one, perhaps your complexion and
his are contrarie. I am like the grimde Priest, for as he coulde
say mattens on no portuse but of his owne, so I can helpe no
complexion but one: therefore, said she, you were best to séeke
you another Phisition, for I am sure that I cannot helpe you:
and take this for an aunswere, if I coulde I woulde not helpe
you. The beste counsel that I can giue you is, in any manner
of wise to take héede that you gette not colde, for feare of
coughing: and thus fare ye well, for I meane to minister
no moe medicines to daye: and so she whipte awaye from
hyr newe patiente, whome I thinke she made rather an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>It was maruel that the patient wente not to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>His olde griefe began newely to growe, for lacke of
his Phisitions Counsel or rather companye: whereby he was
vrged to goe to hir, who bad hym welcome merily, and asked
him how he did pleasantly: whom he aunswered again: I am
better than I was, when you came to me, but not so well as I
was when you went from me: I knew that your honesty was
so good, and your care so great to performe your promise, that
you wold not giue ouer your patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you had promised to cure:
wherfore I feared least you had bin sicke, &amp; therby constrained
to absent your selfe, thinking y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> though many haue cunning to
helpe other, yet they haue least knowledge to cure themselues.
Wherfore though it be something paineful, and dangerous for
me to come far, yet I was so bolde to aduenture, least I shou'd
perish for want of Phisick. Sir, said she, you coulde not dye for
want of phisicke, seeing the Citie is so ful of Doctors of phisick.
Then said he: there is no Phisition doth like me so wel as you,
neither any can giue me so good medicines as you: &amp; moreouer
you haue one good propertie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue not, for many
of them take money and do no good: but you doe good and take
no mony. I am glad, said she, you like me so wel: and therfore,
bycause you haue so good opinion in me, you shall not want my
trauel nor paine throughly to cure you, at the leaste if it lye in
my power: yes saide he, it onlye lyeth in you and in none else.
Syr then, sayd she, if I chaunce to cure you of thys disease (as
I doe not doubte but I shall,) I truste you will not vse me
currishlye for my vsing you curteouslye: neyther séeke at
anye tyme a new Phisition, in your health to make you sicke,
<pb facs="tcp:10199:47"/>
and refuse your old Phisition, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you wer sick made you
whole? No, saide he, if euer I do so, I would not wish to be hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
of any disease if I chaunce to be sick. Wel sir, said she, your
worde to me is as good as a bonde: therfore if you will goe with
me into the nexte Chamber, where thrée or foure of my speciall
frendes are, I wil giue you suche a medicine before them, that
you shal neuer be sicke of the same disease againe. Say you so?
saide he, your wordes haue so comforted me, that I féele my self
almost hole already. If my words, saide she, haue made you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
hole, I trust then my medicine will make you thorowly
hole. And then she caried him into the Chamber where hir fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
were, and there they were betrouthed together: which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
was of so great effect, that it cured him perfectly and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>But did the Gentlewoman tell him howe his frende

               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>That she did not, she had more witte than so: for if
she should, she feared that it would haue renued his Sickenesse.
Therfore she thought it better, to increase his helth by concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it, than to procure his grief by reuealing it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>Within a while after, the Phisition and Patiente
were married togither: wherewith the Gentleman whom hir
husbande toke for his faithful frende, was not wel pleased: and
though he requested him to be at his marriage, yet hée absented
him self, faining him self sick of one disease, though he were sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lein
of another. But the Gentlewoman knewe his griefe well
ynough, though she concealed it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hir husbande, who on a time
said vnto hir: My déere &amp; faithful frend is maruelous sad, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
euer hée aileth: if he be sick, I would I could ease him: if hée
want aught, I would I could giue it him: &amp; if any hath misused
him, I would I knewe him. Sir, saide she, do you think he is
your faithful frende in déede? Yea that I do, saide he, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
euer should say the contrarie of him, I should like the worsse
of them. Then you woulde like the worsse of me, saide she, if I
<pb facs="tcp:10199:48"/>
should say so? I take you as my selfe, saide he, and I my selfe
woulde speake nothing of him but that were true, whereas I
might surmise other would say that were false. Be sure sir, said
she, that whatsoeuer I speake, I would be able to prooue. And
certainely, though I cured your disease, as you knowe by pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise:
so I am certaine I know his disease by speculation. I am
glad of that wife, saide he, for when the disease is knowne, it is
sooner cured. Yea but, saide she, his disease can not be cured tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ugh
it be knowne: and though hée was a meane to cure you of
your grief, yet it lieth not in your power to help him of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease.
That is against reason, said he, it séemeth then that he hath
a very strange disease. So strange it is, said she. His sickenesse
is suche, that within this moneth no man on the earth coulde
helpe him: and now his griefe is so farre growne,<note place="margin">Marke this.</note> that neither
man nor woman can cure him. You knowe that your disease
was such, that you cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>de be holpe by none but by me: and as
no medicine coulde cure you but one, so that medicine could bée
made but once. And what if your supposed frend haue the selfe
same disease that you had? woulde not hée desire the same me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine?
And you know, you had that medicine to cure you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
and it can not be made againe. And if I coulde make that
medicine againe, as I can not, yet I would not make it, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe
that onely medicine on him. And therfore seing his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
and yours is all one, and the onely medicine bestowed on
you that would heale him: then he must eyther mende without
medicine, or ende for lacke of a medicine. Wife, said he, though
you speake parabolically, yet I vnderstande your meaning per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly:
but I pray you, know you this by prouf, or by hearesay?
saide hée. Truste me, I knowe it by triall, saide shée. Hath the
Uilleine, saide he againe, vnder colour of frendeshippe, gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to defraude mée? Coulde hée so falsifie his faith, that I
hauing but one Iewell in all the worlde, hée woulde steale it
from mée? Ah husbande, saide his wife, if I hadde thoughte
you woulde thus haue taken it, I woulde haue bene better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised
before I tolde it. I vttered it vnto you, to shunne a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembler,
<pb facs="tcp:10199:48"/>
not to frette at your foe. Wisedome willeth vs to
heare things aduisedly, to take them pacientely, and to mende
a myschiefe politikely, or if it be paste helpe, to auoyde the lyke
wisely. Therefore good husbande, take him as you finde him,
scrape him out of your Booke of faithfull frendes, and wryte
him in the scrowle of false forsworne dissemblers. Your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
wife, sayde hée, is very good, if I coulde followe it: but my
hart is so ful, that the next tyme I sée him I will bée reuenged
on him. Then his wyfe with wéeping teares, fel downe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hir knées, and sayd vnto him: O husbande, wil you wound
hir that hath healed your wounde? Will you giue hir poyson
that hath giuen you a preseruatiue? And will you procure hir
death that hath saued your lyfe? Remember your promise vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
mée that you made before we were betrouthed. Wife, sayd
hée, I both remember it, and will perfourme it: the wounding
of mine enimie is not the hurting of my frende: my frend doth
not féele the smarte of my foe: therefore if I cutte my enimie,
yet I wound not my wife. Yea sir, said she, but if you kil your
foe, do you not kill your self? And if you kill your selfe, shal you
not kil your most louing wife, which is your own body &amp; your
self? Can furious fighters so moderate them selues, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they can
strike where they li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>te, and hurte no more than they meane?
And can furie persuade them, to stay their stroakes when they
liste? You knowe that fewe fighte with pacience, nor strike
with reason. Anger and reason seldome dwel together, the one
can not abyde the other: Where Anger is, hée dryueth awaye
Reason, and where Reason is entertained, he doth driue from
thence Furie. But if Fighters were fenced with Reason,
as they are armed with Anger, then so much harme would not
come of fighting as doth. Therefore my good husbande, seing
Fighters seeke rather to sheade bloude than saue bloude, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séeche
you take héede you fighte not, neither giue any quarrell
to fight. You knowe if you fighte and kill, you shal be sure to
die therefore: and if hée that you fight withall kill you in figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
what are you the better thoughe hée bée hanged therfore?
<pb facs="tcp:10199:49"/>
There is none so madde I thinke, that would be killed to haue
their foe hanged: and thus, if you kill or be killed, were not your
sorrowfull wife better to bée killed with you, than in sorrowe
worsse than death to liue after you? Therefore my déere hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande,
heare the good counsel of your most louing wife. Banish
anger and embrace pacience: expel furie and be ruled by reason.
Content your self wife, saide he, for your sake, I will refraine
from that I was determined. Will you performe that, said she,
in déed, that you promise me with your worde? Yea that I wil,
saide he, you haue giuen mée too wise a lesson, to fight with such
danger. And so they left off for that time.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>Did he performe the promise he made to his wife?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>He did not, though perhaps he meant to performe it.
For within a while after, it was his chaunce to méete the saide
Gentleman, that woulde haue bene cured with his medicine:
whome when he sawe, he drew forth his Sword, and without
any further debating of the matter, he fought with him, and so
at the length killed him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>His wiues wise talk was manifested by this: he had
bene better to haue performed his promise that hée made to hir.
What a mischief therby wroght he to himself, and what sorow
brought he to his wise and louing wife? It was maruell that it
killed hir not, as soone as she heard it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>Truly when she heard that hir husbande was in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and what was the cause, she swouned presentely: and they
that were about hir had much a do to get any life in hir. Was
not here a goodlie gaine that he got by his fighting? As she said,
neither pacience nor reason was with him, when he gaue the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Deathes wounde. Here we may sée that all wisedom
lies not in men, and al folly and mischief is not in women. But
after, like a wise woman, she brydled hir sorrowe as wel as she
could, and went about to mend the mischief aswel as she might,
according to the lesson she gaue hir husbande before, whiche is
this: Wisedome willeth vs to heare things aduisedly, to take
them paciently, to mende mischiefs politikely,<note place="margin">A saying to be noted.</note> or if they be past
helpe, to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oide the like wisely. And so with as much conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb facs="tcp:10199:49"/>
spéed as she might, she got hir to the saide yong Iudge before
mentioned, in whome (for his wisedome, godlinesse, and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,)
she had suche a good opinion, that she thought through hir
humble sute and pittiful mone, he would finde some one meane
or other to saue hir husbandes life. And when she came before
him she knéeled vnto him, and with wéeping teares saide: O
worthie Iudge, as you are counted a moste wise and mercifull
Iudge, now shew that in effect, which is bruted of you in talke:
and saue an Innocents life that lieth in your hands to destroy.
To whom the Iudge said: stand vp Gentlewoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it wil gréeue
me to sée you stand, much more to knéele: therfore without any
more bidding sit downe by me, and I will not onely heare you,
but also helpe you if I be able: so that equitie do allowe, and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
do bid, hoping that your matter is such, that both these wil
agrée vnto it, for that mée thought your request was to haue me
to saue an Innocents life: and to saue an Innocents life a smal
sute shal serue. And therewith he toke hir gently by the hande,
and caused hir to sit downe by him: who said to the Iudge then:
In déed sir I saide so, for I am that Innocent touching any law
of Death, that lieth in your handes to saue or to kill: not that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
matter is laid against me worthie of Death, but my life (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Innocent) in this case, hangeth on another mannes life
that is not innocent: whose life to saue lieth only in your hands.
I pray you, sayde the Iudge, tell me your matter and cause as
briefly and plainely as you can, and what I may do lawfully, I
will perfourme it willingly. The truth is so, saide the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
I am the wife of suche a Gentleman that killed a man
of late: whose cause I come not to defend, but for whom I come
to craue mercy. I nowe knowe your matter, sayd the Iudge,
I lament his missehap, and I pittie your case. You know Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman,
it hardly lies in me to saue whom the law doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne,
especially him, whose facte is so manifest, and which by
no meanes can be denied. O sir, saide she, it were very straite,
that you being a Iudge so well thought of, and of such great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
that you can not shewe iustice with mercie, and lawe
with fauour. You knowe, sayde hée againe, I am sworne to
<pb facs="tcp:10199:50"/>
doe equitie and iustice according. And you are not ignorante,
that both Gods law and our law willeth, without any redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to kill him that killeth, and to shead his bloude that shead
it. And should I doe iustice if I should saue your husband, who
willingly killed a Gentleman of late, that was not determined
to fight with him? who vnwares set vpon him, and so hée was
slaine, whom the law would haue fauoured in defending him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe?
Therefore Gentlewoman cease your sute, for it lieth not
in my handes to helpe you: but if I coulde I would not. For if
I shoulde saue your husbande in this case, I shoulde gette more
shame and slaunder by this one thing, than I haue gotten good
reporte by all the iustice and equitie that I haue done since I
came in Office. I blame not you, for suing for your husbande in
so euill a cause, whiche you doe for loue: but euery one would
blame mée, for graunting your request in so euill a cause,<note place="margin">A lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble suter.</note> which
they would say I did for monie. O sir, said the Gentlewoman,
(and began againe to knéele, but he woulde not suffer hir,) the
Gentleman is deade, and the death of my husbande will not
make him liue againe: which if it might doe so, I woulde not
be so importunate herein: therefore I beseech you, as euer you
came of a woman, or as you will haue Christ to be mercifull to
you that was borne of a woman, kill not two moe for one that
is deade alreadie. For I assure you, I loue my husband so déer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that if he die, I am most sure that I shall not long liue. Oh
I woulde to God that one frende might die for another, as one
man doth pay monie or is imprisoned for another: then I that
am most woefull would quickly be ioyfull. For then he should
not die, but I would die for him. But seing that can not bée, O
most worthy Iudge, stretch out your power and finde out some
way or meane to saue my husbands life. What so euer you ask
me you shall haue: and what so euer you will haue mée to doe,
I will doe it. Let my vehement wordes penetrate your mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
hearte, if there bée any sparke of pittie, or any droppe of
mercie in you, shewe it nowe vpon mée your most humble ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunte,
which am readie, (if herein you pleasure mée) to runne
at your horsse héeles, or to doe the vilest drudgerie that you can
<pb facs="tcp:10199:50"/>
set me too. Surely Gentlewoman, saide hée, you are the most
importunate suter that euer I knewe. I perceiue where you
may haue yea, you will haue no nay. If your husbande should
escape, hée is bounde to make muche of you. I thinke if you
were in his case, hée neither woulde, nor coulde sue so earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for you. O yes, saide the Gentlewoman, it is his great loue
hée doth beare mée, that causeth me to sue for him so vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye.
You knowe sir what I haue saide, from which I will
not swarue: therefore I beséeche you sende me not away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some comforte, for if you doe, I am most assured, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
you make good haste, I shal be deade before my husbande.
Then the Iudge took the Gentlewoman by the hand, and said:
I will aduise my selfe this nighte what I maye doe, and what
way I may beste pleasure you: bée you of good comforte there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the meane space. But as I will not promise you, so I
will not denay you. And come to morrowe hither to my house,
about this time, and I will be héere readie to speake with you,
when you shall knowe of mée, whether I can, or will pleasure
you, yea or no. At which time, the Gentlewoman tooke hir
leaue of him, something better heartened than when she came
to him.</p>

               <p>I haue not hearde a more earneste suter for hir hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande

            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>The nexte day, I warrante you, shée brake not hir
houre, but wente vnto the Iudge, as hée had appointed hir: and
when shée was come before him, hée made hir to sitte downe
beside him, and caused al the rest that were there, but they two,
to goe awaye: and then hée carried hir into an inner Chamber
with him, bicause no bodie shoulde heare what hée saide vnto
hir, and then thus hée beganne to say: Gentlewoman, the
more I haue considered your case, the more I haue busied my
selfe to helpe you, I assure you, (throughe your pittifull moane
and most earnest sute,) I am determined to doe more for you
and graunt you more fauour, than euer was in my thought to
doe for anie: I muste hazarde that for you, (if I satisfie your
desire) that I woulde not haue ieoperded for mine owne selfe.
<pb facs="tcp:10199:51"/>
And for as much as you saide (to pleasure you, and to saue your
husbandes life) you would giue me what I would aske, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
doe whatsoeuer I would wil you, I will be briefe and make
fewe wordes with you: If you will haue me to saue your hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes
life, then you shall doe thus: You shal giue me six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande
Crownes (for I knowe you are able well to spare it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
your husbande is of such a great liuing as he is) which
you shal bring me hither to morrowe at nighte. The time is
very short, saide shée, and the summe is very great: but if there
bée no remedie, I truste to make shifte for it. You know, said
the Iudge, that if I bée not good vnto him, and finde some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
for him, hée muste bée executed within these thrée or foure
dayes: and therefore you muste make greate spéede therein, for
I will haue it, before I doe deliuer him or saue him. Well sir,
saide the Gentlewoman, you shall haue it: Yea but, sayde the
Iudge, there is another matter behinde, whiche if you doe not,
your husbande is like to die, for I will not receyue the monie
without it: What is it sir, saide shée, and according to my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
I will doe it if I can or may? I knowe, sayde hée, you
will be loath to doe it: this it is, to morrowe at night you shal
bring your monie vnto me your selfe alone, at whiche time, at
such a priuie dore of my house I will receyue you my selfe,
(for I will trust none other with this matter) and then when
you haue deliuered me so many Crownes, you shall tarie with
mée still, and lie with mée all nighte: for I assure you, that if I
desired the companie of your body no more than I estéeme your
Crownes, I woulde not haue promised to saue your husbande,
The Gentlewoman was so sodainely grypte with such a grief,
that she was ready to sinke downe, but the Iudge tooke hir vp
in his armes and comforted hir, saying: Gentlewoman, nowe
is no time for you to fall in a traunce, nor for mée to trytie: if
you had not earnestely of your owne frée will offered me, that
you woulde doe whatsoeuer I willed you, I would neuer haue
required this at your handes, neyther put you in any comforte:
therefore eyther performe your promise, and saue your husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
life: or else be false of your promise, &amp; therby procure his death:
<pb facs="tcp:10199:51"/>
for I assure you, there is none other waye to saue his life, but
this. You know your lying with me shal be so secret, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> none in
the world shal know of it but you and I: and as I wil kéepe it
most secrete,<note place="margin">Marke wel.</note> so I trust you wil not vtter it: which words when
she hearde, she sodainely clapt hir downe on hir knées: but hée
woulde not suffer hir to knéele, but toke hir vp by the hande: to
whom she saide: a sir, in what a straite haue you me now? ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I must lose my husband to whom I haue giuen my faith,
or else lose my faith that I haue giuen my husband: my husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
I can neuer get againe if he dye, and my faith I can neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
againe if I once breake it. Therefore I most humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séech
you, aske me what you wil (this thing only excepted) and
if I performe it not, if I be able, moste willingly and quickely,
then let my husband die without all redemption. I am borne
to some inheritance, all which, both I and my husbande will
most willingly release vnto you: and all my Iewels, Rings
and other ornaments, I wil fetch with spéede and deliuer them
to you, whiche will doe you more pleasure, stande you in more
steade, &amp; comfort you longer, than one nights lying with a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
wretch that had rather be buried than to go to your bedde:
and besides all this that I offer you, take fréelye to youre selfe
those sixe thousand Crownes you request of me. Make no more
adoe Gentlewoman, saide the Iudge: either get you hence with
your gold, or tarrie here &amp; performe my desire: for I am deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
none other waye to saue your husbands life but thus.
Oh good God, said the Gentlewoman, how am I wrapt in wo,
on euery side: if I deny this, my husband shall die: and if I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
it, I betray my husband. How can I loue my husbande,
that so treacherously vse my husbande? Then saide the Iudge,
and how can you loue your husbande, that rather than you wil
lye with me one night, that neuer shal be knowne, will sée the
death of your husbande? Oh sir saide she, if my husbande should
knowe it, woulde he not kil me? yes, and thereof I were well
worthy: nay, saide the Iudge, he would the more loue you, that
did that, for the sauing of his life, whiche you preferde before
your owne life: therfore, saide the Iudge, tel me what you will
<pb facs="tcp:10199:52"/>
do, for I wil be quickly at a point. Well sir, saide she, wil no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
content you but this? No, saide the Iudge: and I will
tell you moreouer, if you performe this my demaunde nowe,
I wil saue his life: but if you refuse it, then, though you wold,
I will not: wherfore, now you may saue your husbandes life,
or within these two or thrée dayes, be moste sure of his death.
To whom the Gentlewoman saide, (preferring hir husbandes
life before all other things in the worlde) well sir, séeing there
is no remedie, I doe yéelde vnto you, beséeching you (for that I
buy my husbandes life with suche a price, that all the treasure
on the earth is not able againe to redeeme) to be sure, that my
husbande be not onely saued from death for this facte, but also,
that all our lands and goods may be ours, in such order as they
were before the offence was committed: and also, haue a great
respecte, that this my promise thus secretly performed, be not
openly vttered. To whome the Iudge saide, assure your selfe
Gentlewoman, al this shal be done, fear you not: which way it
shal be, I haue deuised alredy. Then said she, I will be here at
your priuie dore to morrow at night, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I will, not only bri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
you al your Gold, but also (though sore against my minde) will
performe the rest of my promise. And so y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gentlewoman tooke
hir leaue of the Iudge, as one that was lifted vp with ioy on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
one side, and pulled downe with sorrow on the other side.</p>

               <p>You shal, &amp; that willingly: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gentlewoman brought
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gold at hir houre, by such priuie means as she thought conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
&amp; the Iudge receiued both it &amp; hir, being then something
darke, &amp; so she did lie there al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> night with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudge: to whom he
said in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning before she went fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him: now Gentlewoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
I thank you. And thogh you haue performed your promise ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
vnwillingly, yet you shal wel vnderstand, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I wil performe
mine most willingly. And for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I would as wel haue you to be
of good chéere, &amp; to be quiet in mind, as also not to trouble your
selfe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any pains or trauel: my wil is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you stay at home &amp;<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> go
<pb facs="tcp:10199:52"/>
not abroad: &amp; whereas your husband should haue bin executed
to morrow in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning, I wil dispatch him, &amp; send him home
to morrow vnto you before noone at the furthest, if it be not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
&amp; therfore play the wise womans part, &amp; be secret: &amp; thogh
your husband shall be deliuered so quickly, shew not your selfe
to ioy therfore too sodainely. Wherefore kepe your self close in
your own house, &amp; be mery in mind, thogh for a shew you seeme
to be sad. Wel sir, said y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gentlewoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as I haue satisfied your
desire in an vnreasonable demaund, so I wil obey you in this
reasonable request. And for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I am most sure, that my husband
shal now haue his life: I wish most earnestly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the time were
come, that he were deliuered. Then saide the Iudge, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time is
not long, to morrow you shal haue him safe and sounde w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you.
And thus she departed from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudge, very merie for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sauing
of hir husbands life: but yet something sorrowful for the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of hir faith to hir husband.</p>

               <p>The ioy of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one did mitigate the griefe of the other,
she thought long I am sure for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time appointed by the Iudge:
and was the time for his execution the nexte day after?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>Yea, &amp; the day of his execution too: for the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
about 8, or 9. of the clocke, this sorrowful Gentlewoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
husband was put to death: which, after it was done,<note place="margin">A most cruell deede.</note> was ryfe
in euery mans mouth. And then the saide Gentlewoman stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
at hir dore, saw one come running in all the haste, who se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him comming toward hir so fast, was very glad, thinking
that he came to tel hir of hir husbands life: but it fell out other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
for he came to tel hir of hir husbands death. And when
he came somthing nigh hir, she said: I pray thée what newes?
is my husbande deliuered? deliuered, said he, no, he is executed.
Executed? said y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gentlewoman, I am sure y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> dost but iest. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he said, you may take it now for iest, but shortly you wil find it
in earnest. Yet the Gentlewoman would not beléeue him, shée
had such a trust in the treacherous Iudge: but this vnlooked for
news of hir husbands death, did so pintch hir, that she could not
be quiet, til she wer better certified: wherevpon she would tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
no longer in hir house, but wente forth, to enquire further
<pb facs="tcp:10199:53"/>
of the matter: and within a little while after, not far from hyr
house, she met with two or thrée of hir friendes, that tolde hyr
they came from the execution of hir husband, saying, they wold
haue bin loth to tel hir thereof, but they were sure she was not
ignoraunte of it. Oh saide she, may I credite you? is this true
that you tel me? yea saide they it is too true:<note place="margin">Heauie news.</note> we had rather haue
tolde you otherwayes, for we sée him bothe quicke and deade,
and there was great hast made in the executing of him. With
that the good Gentlewoman fel sodainely to the ground, whom
all they had much adoe to recouer: and they carried hir home to
hir house, and so she laie in a traunce for the space of two or
thrée houres, and knewe no bodie that was about hir: but after
when she came to hir selfe, one of hir friendes that was nie hir
saide: you haue bene alwayes counted, since you were of yeares
of discreation, to be both wise and godly in the time of prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
shewe your selfe so nowe in the time of this your calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
it is no greate masterie to guide a Shippe in calme wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but it is a waightie matter to rule a shippe in a storme or
Tempest: therfore nowe guide your selfe with reason and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
in this time of sorrow. If your sorrow would gette him
againe, I would wish you to vse it: but séeing that cannot bée,
I woulde wish you refraine it. You maye procure your owne
death with griefe: but you cannot get his life againe with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe:
therfore make not two mischiefes of one. I wil not, saide
she, I thank you for your good counsel. Ah wo worth al treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
villains, said she: once this morning I woulde haue laide
all my goods to a groate, that I shoulde haue had my husbande
safe and sound home to me this day before noone: but nowe for
that you (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I credite) haue tolde me that he is dead, and that
the time is past I was promised to haue him here quitte and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue,
my chiefe practise and delight shall be, to be reuenged on
mine enemie: as before, al my trauel and labour was to release
my frend. Haue you such an enemie, said y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, that his déeds
towards you haue deserued death? then she being a wise wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
loth to make any priuy of hir practise, said: truly the death
of my husbande so gréeueth mée, that I speke I wist not what:
<pb facs="tcp:10199:53"/>
therefore take no holde nor effect at my wordes, for I haue
no suche enimie I hope, if I haue, I knowe them not, and
it is also without my desert. And so she pacified hirselfe for
that time as well as she coulde.</p>

               <p>This was the vilest and moste treacherous

he thought by his death to haue marryed the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
thinking that she, when she sawe that hir husbande
was dead, whose life by no meanes she coulde get againe,
woulde be allured to him by little and little wel ynoughe:
iudging also, that she that was so loath to commit that fact
secretely, for the sauing of hir husbands life, would be more
loth to vtter it to hir own shame openly, after hir husbands
death, when there was no hope of his life.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>Well, he was cleane deceiued, in that she was
otherwayes bent and fully determined: for she weighing
with hirselfe, howe treacherously he had serued hir, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in defrauding hir of sixe thousande crownes, but also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaued
hir of two of the greatest Iewels she hadde in the
worlde, that was hir husbande and hir honestie, whiche by
no meanes againe coulde be recouered; that thereby such a
detesting and abhorring of him did enter into hir hart, that
nothing was so pleasant to hir, as to procure his mischief:
and had rather work his death by opening hir own shame,
than to hide hir infamie by sauing his life, as the sequele
doth plainely shewe: for as spéedily as she coulde, she gote
hir decent mourning attyre, and with conuenient men to
waite on hir, rode in all the haste where the Magistrates &amp;
the chiefe Rulers of the Countrey did sit: who knocking at
the Counsel Chamber dore, within a while after was lette
in, when they knewe who she was. And when she came
before them, she knéeled downe: and lamentably and piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
desired them that she might haue Iustice, for that was
the onely thing she craued: and as all my sute of late (saide
she) was chiefly for Mercie, now al my request is onely for
<pb facs="tcp:10199:54"/>
Iustice. Then saide the chiefe of the Counsell, Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
we may perceiue, that some great matter hath driuen
you hither to require Iustice, therefore tell vs your matter
truly, and you shall be sure of Iustice, and that with all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition.
Then she humbly thanked him, and told in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
point and hidde nothing, howe the wicked Iudge did vse
hir. Which when they hearde, they were maruellously a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonied
thereat, at which time they asked hir, if she had any
other witnesse herein than hir selfe: to whome she said, no,
for the facte was so shamefull, that it rather required a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete
place than open witnesses: but I can shewe you suche
priuie markes and tokens, as well of the bagges wherein
the Golde is, and of the place where they lye, as also of the
priuie staires, where he himselfe alone brought me vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Chamber, and of the sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>etes, pillowes, couerings, &amp;
curtains of the bed, where I was enforced to graunt to lye
with him, for the sauing of my husbandes life, and other se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete
tokens, that they will bewray the matter as well as
any witnesses in all the worlde:<note place="margin">No better wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</note> and the opening of myne
owne shame before your Honors, me thinkes may be allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
for a sufficient witnesse. Then they commaunded, that
all the tokens she coulde name, shoulde briefly be written:
And so they were. Then saide the chiefe Ruler to hir as fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:
we wil send one with you with our Commission,
not onely immediatly to discharge the said Iudge and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place
him, but also that he be apprehended and committed
to prison, where he shall remaine vntill such iudgement as
we shall thinke méete to be executed on him. And further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
you shall bring this Commissioner into his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
to whome you shall shewe al the secrete tokens there,
before vs described and by you mentioned. And then they
commaunded the Commissioner to seaze all his goods, and
to scale vppe all the dores of his house, and that he and shée
shoulde ride thither as spéedily and as secretelye as mighte
be, leaste the Iudge hauing fore-knowledge, mighte flie
awaye before they came. And he saide moreouer, that the
<pb facs="tcp:10199:54"/>
Gentlewoman shoulde haue Iustice as she required, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
hir to stand to, &amp; obey their iudgement therein: to
whom she promised she woulde, and that moste willingly:
and so they gaue hir leaue to departe.</p>

               <p>This was verye wisely wrought of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman.
The Iudge litle thought of this mischief that was
so nigh him: he hadde bene as good to haue gyuen Golde to

with hir. But did the Commissioner finde the Iudge at
home when he came?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>That he did, for the Iudge thought himselfe safe
ynough: and so, when the saide Commission was sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>wed to
the Rulers of the Citie, the Iudge was dismissed out of hys
office, and straightway was committed to prison: and then
the Commissioner with other appointed, toke the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman
with them as a guide: to whome she shewed the
posterne gate where he receiued hir into his Chamber, and
also al the markes and priuie tokens with the place where
the Gold she gaue him did lye, euen as shée hadde tolde the
Counsell, and there they founde all the Golde which he

               <p>I haue hearde of men that haue giuen Gold, to

in the putting hir husband to death. Well, thoughe shée
coulde not get hir honestie, nor hir husbandes life agayne,
she mighte haue hir Golde agayne: but had she it againe
or not?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>You shal know that hereafter, in a place more fit
to be tolde. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Commissioner &amp; his other associates,
hadde founde all the tokens and markes true as she hadde
declared, they locked all the dores in his house, and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them vppe: mary all the golde, siluer, plate, and iewels
<pb facs="tcp:10199:55"/>
that they found, was committed to other that was charged
safely to kéepe it. And so the Gentlewoman went home to
hir house: whose greate sorrowe was mitigated, for that
she hoped shortelye to sée the confusion of hir moste mortall
enimie. And the Commissioner departed with spéede to the
chiefe Ruler of the Countrie and the Counsel, vnto whom
he reuealed howe the Gentlewoman had told them trueth
in euery thing. And then soone after they consulted among
themselues, what iudgement were méete to be giuen ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:
and whiche waye that good and louing Gentlewoman
might not be defamed, by that vnwilling and constrained
fact: and how the peoples mouthes might be stopped, for
vttering the same to hir infamie: and howe it might not be
a slander to hir, nor a hinderance to hir marriage. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon,
with long debating of the matter, they agréed, that
hir honestie coulde not be saued, nor the infamous talke
suppressed of hir lying with the Iudge, but onely by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
of the same Iudge: and so they concluded, and gaue
iudgement, that (séeing he had done hir suche a shame and
villanie) suche a day by them appointed, he should prepare
him in the beste maner he coulde, to marry hir, with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
secrete iudgement besides, whiche was priuily vttered
by the Commissioner: who was appointed, not onely to sée
the marriage celebrated betwéene them accordingly, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the other secreate thing performed, in all pointes as the
Counsel hadde decréede. Whiche Iudgement was carried
downe thither where the Gentlewoman dwelled, by the
saide Commissioner. And when the day of the mariage ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched,
the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missioner came into the prison to the same
wicked Iudge, &amp; said, that the Ruler and the Counsel, had
giuen iudgement, forasmuch as he had taken a Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
good name from hir, by lying with hir,<note place="margin">Better than he looked for.</note> that he should
prepare himselfe in the beste manner he coulde to marrye
hir, thereby to make hir amendes: whiche, when the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
Iudge heard, he was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gladdest ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the world:
for that was the onelye thing he desired, and the cause why
<pb facs="tcp:10199:55"/>
hée executed hir husbande. And so he prepared himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainste
the day appointed to marry hir. And then the sayd
Commissioner went to the saide Gentlewoman, whome
when she sawe, she was maruelous gladde, saying: sir, you
are moste hartily welcome: I praye you what iudgement
haue my Lords of the Counsel giuen on my behalf against
the wicked Iudge mine enimie? Forsooth, saide he, as they
thinke, a verye good and necessarie iudgement, thoughe it
be not altogither as you desire: but in my opinion, it is as
wise and righteous a iudgement as can be. Well sir, said
shée, though it be not according to my contentation, yet I
must be obedient, knowing, &amp; being wel assured, that they
are so wise, righteous, and godly, that they will giue none
other iudgement, but according to equitie, iustice, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
and therefore, as I haue promised their Honors, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
iudgement they haue giuen, I muste be content, and
will. It is very well saide of you, saide he, there is no resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
of them, and therefore, the more willinglier you take
it, the better they will like of you. I praye you sir, saide
she, what is it? thoughe I am loath, saide he, to vtter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it
vnto you, bicause it will not well like you: yet I am enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to tell you of it, bycause the Counsell haue commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
me. Spare not I beséeche you, saide she, to declare it
vnto me: for, if it be any thing that may moue my mind, I
am determined to arme my selfe with patience. I pray you
do so, saide he, for you shall sée, that God at the length, will
turne all things to the best: now thus it is: the chiefe Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
and the reste of the Honorable Lordes of the Counsell,
haue giuen their iudgement, and fully decréed, that against
suche a day you shall prepare your selfe, in most sober and
comely wise, to be married vnto him: for they thinke, that
the infamie you haue receiued by hym,<note place="margin">Worse than she looked for.</note> can be salued by no
meanes so wel, as by being his wife, and to be married vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him: therfore prepare you for it accordingly, for there is
no remedy; but you muste performe this their decrée and
iudgement: whiche, when she hadde hearde, she waxed as
<pb facs="tcp:10199:56"/>
pale as was possible: whereby it appeared, that inwardly
she was not a little vexed and troubled. And wythin a
while after she saide: shall I nowe marry hym that hathe
cruelly killed my louing husbande whom he promised mée
to saue, and spoiled me of my faith and honestie, whiche I
can neuer recouer againe? to haue the life of my husbande,
made me to goe to his bed loathfully, and can the death of
my husbande make me to lye with him willingly? Oh, I
woulde to God, that the Counsell hadde not respected so
muche mine honestie, as to make me doe that I deteste
more than death. I had rather a thousande times liue in
shame, than to marry him that is cause of my shame. Then
said he to hir againe. Did not you tell me, that you would
arme your selfe with patience, thoughe I shoulde tell you
that did trouble your minde? I saide so indéede, but when
I saide so, thoughe all things were not so wel as I would,
yet I did not thinke that it was so euill as it is: to marry
him is the thing he moste desireth,: but to be marryed to
him, is the thing that I moste abhorre: whereby he shall
haue a ioyful life that hathe deserued a cruell death: but
thereby I shall haue a sorrowfull death, that oughte rather
haue a ioyfull lyfe. I hoped that the daye appoynted for
his marying with me, shoulde rather haue béene the daye
of hys death, for so shamefully abusing me. Well, I will
obey theyr commaundementes, trusting thereby, that my
sorrowe shall ende: and whereas that nighte he thinketh,
that I shall bée bedded wyth hym, I hope that then I shall
be buried by my selfe. There was neuer a sorrowfuller
Bride than I shall be: but looke what you haue willed me,
I will doe it, and what the Counsel haue iudged I wyll
performe it. And then he toke his leaue of hir and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>This was not suche a iudgement as shée looked
for, nor yet as the wicked Iudge didde hope to haue. But
didde she come at the daye appoynted to be marryed vnto
him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb facs="tcp:10199:56"/>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>Yea that she did, thoughe it was full sore against
hir will: for in the same morning he was ready at the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
a good while before she came, for if he had béene so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
as she, he woulde not haue come so soone as he did.
And at the laste, she came in hir mourning apparell, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the would weare the same at hir owne dolefull mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
that she did weare at hir husbandes death. And so to
conclude, they were both married togither, wherof he was
as glad as she was sorrowfull. And when they were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed,
and as he was aboute to go home with his newe
wofull wife, the saide Commissioner saide: sir you muste
stay a little, this Gentlewoman youre wife hathe perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
all the iudgements that on hir parte are to be done:
but thoughe you haue done some, yet you haue not done al,
there is one péece yet behinde for you to performe. What
is that? said the Iudge, for I wil do it willingly: then said
the Commissioner, not so willingly I beléeue as you were
marryed, vnlesse you are willing to goe to youre death:
whereat the Iudge was astonied: and then the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner
saide to him:<note place="margin">A wise and worthy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> nay, there is no remedy, the Counsels
iudgemente is, that immediately after you are married,
you muste bée executed: therefore prepare youre selfe, for
I muste sée it done presently. And as for you Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
saide he, you were beste goe to dinner, and not tarry
for youre husbande, for he hath an other parte to play. O,
saide the Gentlewoman, blessed be God that hathe giuen
vs suche wise and godlye Counsellours, that haue gyuen
suche a worthy iudgement: the death of my firste husband
did not make mée so wofull a Widowe, but the death of
my seconde husbande dothe make me as ioyful a Widow.
Here was a sodaine change, for whereas before the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome
was mery and the Bride sad: nowe the Bride was
moste merry, and the Bridegroome sorrowfull, and so
shée wente to hir dinner, and hée to hys death. Whose
execution was not verye long in hande, for shée was
a Widowe agayne that day béefore shée hadde dyned.
<pb facs="tcp:10199:57"/>
And to comfort hir the better, she had not only all hir golde
againe, but also all the Iudges hir seconde husbands goods:
for the Counsell commaunded that he shoulde lose none of
hys goodes, whereby this Gentlewoman his wife enioyed
them all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>Truely they were godly and wise Counsellers:
their iudgement was with greate equitie, iustice and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
I am sure she was gladder that he shoulde goe to hys
death, than with hir to dinner.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>That is moste true, and contrary: he had rather
haue gone with hir to dinner, than to his death. Surely, it
is a vile thing for one to take mony, for getting of a pardon
to saue a mans life, and to do nothing in it: but it is a most
wicked and detestable thing, to take money for the sauing
of a mans life, and then to cause him be spéedily putte to
death. I pray you sir, haue you any law for suche as take
rewardes for bringing matters to passe, and make men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue
that they trauell therein for them, and doe nothing
at all?</p>
            </sp>

               <p>We haue a lawe for suche, but we néede no lawe

               <p>Forsooth, whosoeuer taketh a rewarde for doing

by their frendes, to procure and to gette a thing for them, and

trust to abide in long: for he had no Lease in it, but occupied it
during the absence of a Gentleman, and no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger could he haue
it but vntill he came home: which sicklie man, not well able to
trauel, &amp; knowing that within foure or fiue miles of him, there
was a Lease of a good Farme to be solde, sent for one whom he
toke for his very and trustie frend: when he was come to him,
he saide as followeth: Neighbour and frende, for the great cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
and trust I haue in you, I am ensorced at this time to craue

saide the other. You knowe neighbour, saide he, that I dwell

for as soone as the Gentleman commeth home, (who hath none
other house but this to dwell in himself) I looke to bée houslesse,

I shall desire you to do so much for me, as to goe thither to

no care, for if he wil sel it (as you thinke he wil) I wil driue the
price, and buie it for you as well as if you were there your self,
and to morrow (God willing) I wil go about it. Do so, said the
other, and I praye you let me heare howe the matter goeth, as
sone as you can: and so he took his leaue. Two or thrée days past
on, and yet he could not heare of his neighbour, and then he sent
againe to him to desire him to come and speake with him: who
sent him word that he would come by and by. And as soon as he
came, the sickly man said: Neighbor, I loked for you two dayes
since, marueling that you taried so long seing your iourny was
so short. Neighbour, said he againe, a short iournie may haue a
long businesse, and a shorte businesse may haue a long iourney:
the distance of the places we know, but the time of dispatch we
know not. We that do trauel are sure of our selues, but we are
not sure to find them at home to whom we trauel. Therfore be
content good neighbor, I came but euen now home, and now I
am come to you, which I had done though you had not sent for
me. I am as desirous to tell you, as you are to heare, what I
haue done. Wel neibor, sayd the sick man, what haue you done
therin? or how haue you sped? Not so wel as I wish, for your
sake, sayd hée. I went thither the nexte day, as I promised you,
but I found him not at home, but they thought he would come
home that might, for whose co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming I taried so late, that it was
to far for me to reach home by day light, and yet for al my tary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for him hée came not home that night at all. Whiche grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
me that I taried there al night, and was thereby neuer the
<pb facs="tcp:10199:58"/>
nearer. The next day I taried for his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming till almost night,
so that I ment to tarrie no longer there, but to come homward.
But as I was going out of the house, I met him comming in,
whome I told how long I had stayed only to speake with him,
desiring him to talke with me in some secret place, where I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght
vtter my minde vnto him, for that I made haste to be gone.
Sir, sayde he, if you will haue aught with me, you shall tarrie
with me all night, and at leysure you and I wil talke togither,
for I am something wearie, assuring you, that I had rather sit
and warme me by the fire, than to stande and talk in the colde.
Therefore determine your selfe to tarrie all night, and though
your Supper be but simple, your bed shal be the better. Whose
gentle offer I could not wel refuse, and the rather, to dispatche
your matter, and to bring your purpose to passe. And so I both
supt well, and lay well, and also I slept as well.</p>
               <p>As sone as we were vppe the nexte morning, and had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
our faste, the Good man of the house sayde vnto mée: come
and walke with me, I am more willing to talk with you than
I was yesternight. What haue you to say vnto me? Forsooth,
sayde I, I vnderstande that you meane to sell the Lease of this
your Farme you dwel in: and if you be so determined, I haue
a very honest neighbour that is nowe destitute of a house, who
will giue you as much for it as it is well worth. The truth is
so, saide the other, I was determined within this moneth to
haue solde it, but nowe my minde is altred, for I haue no such
occasion to occupy mony nowe, as I had before, and therfore I
am fully determined to kéepe it still in my handes. Then saide
I, if you be not determined to sell it, I am sure my neighbour
will not be desirous to buie it. And so I gaue him thankes, and
departed from him. And this is the very conclusion of al. Then
saide the sicke neighbour to him that he had sent thither: What
remedy? that that a man can not haue, he must be contented to
forgoe.<note place="margin">It was not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of thanks.</note> Saying also, I thank you neighbour for your paines, I
wil doe as much for you if it lie in my power. And so his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
went home.</p>

               <p>More falsehode than faith, and more crafte than true
dealing: for within a moneth after his saide neighbor that was
sent to buie this Farme for him, came to him vnsente for, and
saide as followeth: I am sorie that you can get neuer a house to
dwel in, and for that I would be loath that you should be hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
I will sell you the Lease of my Farme that I dwel in, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than you shoulde want one. I thanke you neighbour, saide
hée, but as you would be loth that I should bée without a house,
so would I be sorie to make you houselesse. Nay neighbor, said
he, I do not meane to be houselesse my selfe, though I sell you
my house, for if you may spare it vntill your Landlorde come
home, I doubt not but by that time to get another house better
than mine. I am promised one if it will hit, and if he break pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
with me, as I think he wil not, yet I hope to get another,
for my frendes will hearken about for me. How farre, said the
sicke neighbour, is the Farme that is promised you? Forsooth
aboue twentie miles hence, saide he. Well, said his sicke neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
if you can gette another house for your selfe then I pray
you let me buie youres: yes that you shall neighbour, saide he,
and I hope within this Seuenight to be so sure of one, that I
may bergaine with you for mine. I would be glad of that, sayd
the sick neighbor. And so for that time he departed home.</p>

               <p>Yea that he did, and lesse, and then he said thus vnto
him: Now neighbour I am come to you according to my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.
I make a full accompt now to be sure of another Farme,
and therfore I am come to offer you my Farm, if you wil haue
it, you shall haue it before any other. And thoughe there be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
that are desirous to haue it, you shall forsake it before I do
proffer it to any other. I thanke you therefore good neighbour,
saide he: now tell me your price: You shall haue it for fortie
poundes, said he, that is the lowest price, I wil not sel it vnder.
O neighbour, saide the other, that is a great deale too deare, the
other Farme that I sent you to buie for me, woulde haue bene
solde for halfe the monie, as I was credibly tolde, and once the
<pb facs="tcp:10199:59"/>
owner therof was fully determined so to haue solde it, and it is
twice as good as yours, I am sure. Notwithstanding, for my
necessitie, I will giue you as muche for it as it is worth, and
something more: Well, to be short, said he againe, vnlesse you
wil giue me so much for it, you can not haue it, and therfore say
nowe whether you wil haue it or no, for if you refuse it, it will
be gone, I can tel you that, and that for this price that I offer it
to you for. Wel neighbor, I perceiue bicause my néed is great,
therfore you make the price the greater: nay if you say so, saide
the other, then you shal not haue it: is this al the thanks I haue
for my good will? and so was going away in a sume. Then the
sicke neighbour called him backe againe, and sayd: Good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
be not angrie, I meant no harm, your vnreasonable price
made me speake so much: but I pray you do one thing for mée,
let me pawse of the price betwéen this and to morrow at night:
well, saide the other, I giue you leaue to doe so, but then I pray
you let me haue a determined aunswere whether you wil haue
it or not: you shal not faile therof, saide he. And his said neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
came vnto him the next night, at which time the bergaine
was fully made betwéen them, and so he paide him forty poun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
for his Lease. And the time was apointed in their writing,
when hée should enter vpon it. But now, you shal sée how the
matter fel out. The Gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in whose house this sickly Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
dwelled, came home: so that there was no remedie, but
that he must dwel in his owne house, whereby he that dwelled
in it, was enforce to remoue, to his neighbours house, the lease
whereof he had boughte: and so he came to his neighbour and
saide, neighbour there is no remedie, I must be so bold to enter
and dwel in this house that I boughte of you, for that my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
therein is alreadie begunne, but chiefely that my Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord
is come home, to whome I muste néedes giue place in hys
owne house. Well neighbour, saide he, I can not denie but
that I haue solde it vnto you, but if I had knowne so muche
as I doe nowe, I woulde not haue putte it awaye: for the
trueth is so, I am disappointed of my house, which I told you
is aboue twentie myles hence, therefore if you woulde stay but
<pb facs="tcp:10199:60"/>
one Seuenight, I shoulde thinke my selfe much beholden vnto
you, and in the meane space I wil laye out for another, and if
I cannot get one by that time, yet I wil make such shifte, that
then I wil remoue from hence, and suffer you quietly to enter
on your own: wel, saide his sickly neighbour, I doe not doubte
to get my Landlords good wil to tarrie in his house so long, and
therefore tarrie you here this seuenight, for I dare presume so
much of him. And then at the seuenights ende, his neyghbour
came to him, at whiche time he was remouing his goods and
stuffe from thence, to whom he saide then: nowe neyghboure I
perceiue you are true of your word. And so this sickly Farmer
entred quietly on his neighbours Farme that he bought. And
at the last when the other hadde almoste remoued all his goods
from thence, this sickly Farmer said to him: now neyghbor tel
me, are you driuen to lye within another man for the time, or
haue you got a Farme of your owne? no I thanke God, said he,
I haue gotten at the laste one of mine owne, whiche I haue
gotten within this seuenighte: for when you gaue me leaue to
tarrie vntil this time in your house, I promise you I knew not
then that it woulde be solde, but as good hap was, a very friend
of mine séeing me in suche a distresse for wante of a house,
tolde me, that this Farme that I haue now got, would be sold:
wherevppon I made haste to the partie that oughte it, and so I
made short worke considering my greate necessitie, and haue
now made it sure though I payde for my pleasure. I pray you
neyghboure, saide the other, lyeth it in a good soyle, and is it
farre hence? no, saide he, it is within this foure or fiue miles,
and it is verye good grounde, and lyeth in a good soyle. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aboute
(saide he) doth it lye, and of whom did you buy it? wot
you of whome? saide the other: no surely (saide he) how shoulde
I know vnlesse you tel me? truely, saide the other, I had verye
good lucke to hit of it, it is the Farme that you did sende me to
buy for you, which then by no meanes he would sel, but nowe
of late (whatsoeuer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause was) he was enforst to sel it. Wel,
said the other, I would it had bin my chaunce to haue knowne
<pb facs="tcp:10199:60"/>
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, for then I would not haue bought yours. And (said the other)
I would not haue sold you my Farme, if I had not thought my
selfe sure of the Farme twentie miles hence, that was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
me. But I thanke God now as it chaunst (saide he) I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as wel. Then sayd his neighbour that bought his, but now
there is no remedie (said he) God sende you to do wel of yours,
and God graunte I maye prosper on myne: and so they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>

               <p>That felow was a craftie Harlot, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sold his Farme,

               <p>He didde so in déede: but hys good meaning neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
coulde not perceiue it, neither didde mistrust him: but as
crafte and disceite haue neuer good ende, so trueth bewrayeth
falshod by one mean or other: for not long after, one that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the same Towne, where this craftie fellowe had bought
the Farme, chaunst to be in the companye of this sickely Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
who (when he knewe that he dwelled there) saide: one of
our neighbours hath gotten a good Farme with you, as I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande,
I praye you what paide he for it? forsooth saide the
other, as I hearde it reported, he hadde it cheape ynough, for
he paide vnder twentie poundes for it: yea, saide the beguiled
Farmer, I woulde haue giuen thirtie poundes a quarter of a
yeare since for it, and I sente him worde by the same man that
nowe hath boughte it: but he woulde not then forgo it, thoughe
before he was determined to sel it. Then said the other, he hath
sold it now for a good deale lesse. And so there was no more talk
of it at that time: but as soone as this fellowe came home, hée
went to him that hadde solde the saide Farme (for he bare hym
good will) and saide, you haue solde youre Farme verye cheape
as I vnderstand: I would, said he, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I had solde it cheaper, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
it had bin to such a one as would haue kept touche with me, &amp;
paide me my mony at my day. Then said the other, did you not
receiue al your mony therfore prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly? no nor sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t half, said he.
<pb facs="tcp:10199:61"/>
Then saide the fellowe: I was in companie of a verie honest
man of late, that woulde haue giuen you thirtie pounde for it,
or more rather than he woulde haue gone without it: then saide
he, he shoulde haue had it, if I had knowne so much: he told me
himselfe, saide the fellow, that about a quarter of a yeare since,
he would haue bought it, hearing then that you were determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to sell it: and thervpon he sent you word thereof: that is not
so, saide the other, or else if he sente vnto me to buy it, the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
was not done vnto me: can you tel, saide he, by whom hée
sent that message? marrie saide the felowe, he sente the message
by him that nowe hath boughte it of you: is it euen so? saide he:
then I smell a Ratte: who is it I pray you, that tolde you thus?
and that sent me word aboute the buying of my Farme? &amp; then
he tolde him who it was, and where he dwelled: and so he gaue
him thankes, and then the one departed from the other.</p>

               <p>I beléeue he that solde the Farme thought long, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til

            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>That is verie true, for the next daye after he wente
vnto him, and saide: I vnderstand that you sent a neighbour of
yours aboute a quarter of a yeare since, for the buying of a
Farme for you that is in such a place. Then the beguiled Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
saide, I did so indéede: I praye you saide the other, what
woulde you haue giuen for it with a good wil? forsooth, said hée,
I bad him offer in my behalfe thirtie pounde for it, and more
rather than faile. And what aunswere brought he you againe?
saide the other: he tolde me, said the beguiled Farmer, that hée
woulde not then sel it, for he had no néede, though before he had
an occasion so to doe: and who was it, saide the other, that thus
you did put in trust to make &amp; conclude this bargaine for you?
forsooth, saide he, euen he that boughte it of late, and that nowe
doeth dwell in it. Doe not you vnderstand, saide the other, how
long it is since he bought the same? yes truely, saide he, if I may
beléeue him, for he himselfe tolde me that he bought it not past
foure or fiue days before he came to dwel in it. Wel honest ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
saide the other, I am he of whom he bought the same Farme be
<pb facs="tcp:10199:61"/>
nowe dwelleth in, and to whom you sent him to buy it for you.
You are defrauded, and I am misused: why so? said the begui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Farmer: for at that time when you sent him to me, (which
is a quarter of a yeare since at the least) hée concluded with mée
for it, and paide me ten poundes in hande, which is all I can get
yet of him for it: And therfore he tolde you a false lie, whereby
he hath defrauded you of your Farme, and me of my price: but
wil you stand to this (if néed be) said hée, that you sent him to me
for that purpose? Yea that I wil, saide the other, for I haue good
occasion therto: I was the first that tolde him of it, and put him
in trust (bicause I was sicke) to go vnto you, &amp; to driue the price
for me, through whose craftie and false dealing, it séemeth that
both you and I are deceiued. Wel, I feare, saide the other, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ugh
he hath deceiued vs at the first, he will bée woorsse deceiued
himself at the last. Therfore be ready at al times when néed is,
I pray you: you shal not néed to feare, but that I will be readie
to witnesse the truth. And then he that solde the craftie fellowe
his Farme, departed and went home.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen</speaker>
               <p>He would not pay it him, as you shal heare, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
two or thrée dayes after he came vnto him and saide, I pray
you pay me the reste of my monie you owe me for my Farme:
For your Farme? saide the other, I owe you none, I paid you
al your mony in hand that I bought it for. Haue you so? said he,
you paide me but ten poundes in hand, and al wise men might
iudge me to be a very foole to sel it for so litle, for it is wel worth
as much more as you gaue me for it. I trusted you vpon your
owne worde, without writing or witnesse, for the paymente of
the rest, therfore you do not honestly vse me to deny it. If I had
as euil a conscience as you, I might as wel claime thrée times
as much as you owe me, as you to denie all that you owe me.
But as I claime no more than my due, so I pray you deny me
not of that is my due. If I owe you any thing, saide the other,
then get it by law, otherwise you shal haue no more of me than
you haue had. I perceiue, (saide he that solde the Farme) you
<pb facs="tcp:10199:62"/>
meane now to put me to my trumpe, for that you are sure, I
haue neither Obligation nor Bil of debt for the payment of the
same, neither know any witnesses that heard the bergaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene
you and me: but if you were as godly as craftie, and as
honest as you are deceiteful, you would not vse me so euill, for
trusting you so wel. But ther is no remedie, if I lose it, I may
thank mine owne folly. And so he went away from this crafty
fellow not very wel pleased.</p>

               <speaker>Omen</speaker>
               <p>No I warrant you, as he handled the matter, he had
bene better to haue paide him his money with quietnesse: for
he did not only sue him by a byll of complaint, for the rest of his
money, but also reuealed all his crafte and deceite to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudge,
which he vsed, in defrauding his neighbor of the Farm: which
when the Iudge hearde: what, saide he, haue we such a fellowe
dwelling among vs? I woulde haue thoughte there was not
such a one to be founde in all our Countrey. If this be true that
you tel (as I beléeue you know to whom you speake) (for it is
no smal da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger to tel aly to a Iudge) I wil make y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al they here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
that shal dwel in the Countrey of <hi>Mauqsun,</hi> shal beware
how they deceiue any. Therfore bring him before me, said the
Iudge, and I wil dresse him according to his deserts. I thanke
you my Lord, saide he that complayned vnto him, it shall not
be long before he shal be brought before you. And immediately
after he came home, he caused the sayde craftie fellow to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested.
So that there was no remedie but that he muste
néedes appeare before the Iudge. And at the daye of hys
appearaunce, he came into the Courte where the Iudge dydde
sit, and he that did sue him, was there readie also. And then by
and by the Iudge called for him by hys name, and caused him
to come before him. To whom the Iudge saide: are you he my
friend, that bought the Lease of a Farme of such a man? yea my
lord, said he: what did you giue him for it, said y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudge: forsooth
said he, I gaue him x. <abbr>l.</abbr> But for howe much did he sell it vnto
you, said y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudge? for x. <abbr>l.</abbr> said he: he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> selleth such a Farme as I
vnderstande that is, saide the Iudge, for ten poundes, eyther he
<pb facs="tcp:10199:62"/>
knoweth not what he doth, or else will neuer thryue. Come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you that sold the Farme, said the Iudge: For what summe
did you sel your Farme to him? for .xx. <abbr>l.</abbr> my Lord, saide hée, of
which he gaue me .x. <abbr>l.</abbr> in hand, and I gaue him half a yeres day
of payment for the rest. Where is your Bill of det, or Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that you toke of him for the same? said the Iudge: My Lord,
said he, I haue none, I thought him to be so honest a man, and
trusted his honesty so wel, that I neither required it of him, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

yet he offered it to mée. Then saide the Iudge: Haue you any
witnesses, that he hath not paide you all? or that he oweth you
any? No my Lord, said he, as I trusted him without writing,
so I credited him without witnesses. Then saide the Iudge: I
can sée none other, for that you haue neither writing nor wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but that you haue al the monie you are like to haue. Wel
my Lorde, saide he, if I lose it I knowe the woorste: I know in
my conscience he oweth it mée, which will be a burthen to his
conscience if he deny it. And dost thou say of thy conscience, said
the Iudge, that hée doeth owe thée tenne poundes? Yea, my

thée déepely, that thou knowest of thy conscience, that thou
doest owe vnto him tenne poundes:<note place="margin">A naughtie conscience.</note> Howe sayest thou? doest
thou owe it him of thy conscience, or no? And then hée sayde:
My Lorde, of my conscience I owe it him not. The one of you,
sayde the Iudge, hath but a slender conscience. Take héede my
frende, thoughe for wante of Writing or other testimonie,
thou mayest bleare mine eyes: yet for all that, thou canste not
deceiue God, which is the chiefe Iudge of all. Though thou
shouldest carrie this matter cleare, and bée quitte of it before
me thy earthly Iudge: yet thy matter must be ripped vppe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
before Christ at the laste day, the heauenlye Iudge, who
without either writing or witnesse, doth and will then knowe
the truthe quickly. And then (thoughe nowe by fraude thou
deceiue this plaine dealing man of his ten poundes) if hée finde
that thou doest owe vnto him so much, thou haddest bene better
<pb facs="tcp:10199:63"/>
to haue giuen ten times more than thou owest him, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to giue
him one groate lesse than his due. For I assure thée, and truste
to it, that the euerlasting torments of Hell fire are prepared for
the wicked, and suche as defraude their brethren of their right.
Therfore if thou owe it, pay it vnto him, and driue not off till
Christ the highe Iudge compell thée to pay thy debtes to God:
for then thou shalt be alwayes paying it in Hell, and thou shalt
neuer come out, vntil thou haue paide the laste farthing, which
wil neuer be paide. So that by defrauding this man of tenne
poundes, which is but drosse, and earthlie riches, thou wilt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaue
thy selfe of the kingdome of Heauen, which is an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
treasure. Wherfore thou were better open the truth now
willingly, whereby Christ may be thy frende at the latter day:
than to haue it opened before Christ against thy wil then, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by
he will be thy vtter enimie and committe thée to Hell fire to
be a companion of Diuels for euer. Therfore nowe tell me the
truth, doest thou owe him ten pounds or no? My Lord, said the
fellow, I owe him none, for if I had ought him any, he woulde
haue had something to shew. Well, saide the Iudge, seing this
way wil not serue, I wil go another way to worke, and if it be
founde that thou owest it (as I doubt not but to sifte it out as I
will vse the matter) thou art like to smoke for dissembling with
me, and to pay dearly for euerie lie thou hast made. Sirra, said
the Iudge to him that solde the Farme, did not you make him a
quittanie for the ten poundes he paide you? Yes my Lord, said
he, for he willed me to make him one for the receite therof: and
then I made him a quittance, and sealed it, and deliuered it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
two or thrée honest witnesses. Loe, saide the Iudge, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of these two are shewed herein, for this man that sold the
Farme, of a good and honest nature, did aske him no bil of debt
for the ten poundes he had to paie him: but the other missetrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of him that trusted him, did require a quittance for the ten
poundes he paide him. Wel, there is a great difference betwéen
fraude and faithful meaning. Where is that quittance, said the
Iudge, that this honest plaine meaning man made you? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth
my Lorde, saide he, I must néedes confesse that I had such
<pb facs="tcp:10199:63"/>
a one, but I haue lost it. I perceiue, saide the Iudge,<note place="margin">A false shift.</note> that there
is something in it, that wil rather make against you than with
you, for that you faine you haue loste it, and all bicause you are
loath to shewe it. But seing you wil not shewe your quittance,
I wil make you shew it, or else pay him his ten pounds againe
which you say you paide him: and then you had bene as good to
haue paide him the ten pounds you owe him, with your wil, as
to paie him ten more against your wil. We haue a law and an
order here, that al aquittances and General quittances with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
other writings must be recorded: and if the same bée not
recorded, the acquittance is of no force, and it shall be lawefull
for the partie that receiued the mony (if he wil) to claime it and
receiue it again. Now if you had such a quittance, and the same
not recorded, then it is lawful for him to claime the ten pounds
againe that you paide him, if he will. And if the same be recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
then we will haue it quickly out of the recorded writings.
And then the Iudge commaunded one of his Clearkes to search
the Recordes therefore, and with spéede to bring vnto him the
true copie therof. Which the Iudges Cleark did, who serching
the Recordes for the same quittance, found it and brought it to
the Iudge his maister: which when he had viewed wel and red
throughly, he said: I perceiue it was not for nothing,<note place="margin">A good way to try the truth.</note> that you
had lost your quittaunce, and that you were so loth to bring it
to light: here it is manifest that you paide this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ten pounds,
but here is another clause doeth followe, that quite condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
thée, which is, that thou hast paide him ten pounds in part
of paiment of twentie pounds, my Lord said the craftie fellow,
that is more than I bad him, and the other saide, more than I
willed him to doe: but indéede I remember when he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to write the quittaunce, he asked me if it shoulde be a
generall quittaunce? and I said no: and then he asked me if the
ten pounds was in part of paymente, of anye of the summe or
not? I tolde him then it was in parte of paymente of twentie
pounds. Send for the Notarie that writ the quittance, said the
Iudge, and bidde him come to me with spéede<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so one went for
him and brought him before the Iudge, who confest the same
<pb facs="tcp:10199:64"/>
words that the honest man had spoken before: and though (said
the Notarie) neither of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> willed me to write it, yet I thought
good to set it in, for the better declaring of the truth if néed shold
require: thou hast done verie wel therein, saide the Iudge, and
like an honest and wel meaning manne, and as the matter fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
out,<note place="margin">A good No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie.</note> it hath brought the trueth to light, whiche a false fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
here wente aboute to suppresse: thou noughtie, varlet
saide the Iudge, howe durst thou make such a manifest lye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, when I charged thée so vehemently on thy conscience to
tel trueth? but rather how durst thou presume to take it on thy
conscience, that thou oughtst him nothing, before the maiestie
of God that knew thy conscience? But thoughe thou thoughtst
to outface me and this honest man,<note place="margin">Marke.</note> (thinking thy selfe sure that
there was none to witnesse against thée) yet God that will ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be mocked nor outfaced, hath brought both writing &amp; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
against thée: my Lorde saide the Notarie, I read it before
them both, before it was sealed and deliuered, and they sound
no fault therewith: the one sealed it gladly, and the other recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
it willinglie. This is both manifest and apparant, said the
Iudge, for this fellow confest before, that he had such a quitta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of him, which he would not haue receiued vnlesse he had liked
it, and it had bin according to trueth. Therefore come hyther
sirra, saide the Iudge, and stande neare, that you maye heare
your Iudgement for your two notable lyes that you made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me, and for the defrauding of this man of his mony. You
shall, according to our Law, kéepe silence and speake neuer a
word to any for the space of sixe monthes, that is, for either lye
thrée monthes, (vnlesse you be required therto by some Ruler
or Iudge, for some waightie matter or cause) &amp; you shal weare
on your sléeue al the whyle, an <hi>H.</hi> and an <hi>L</hi> for a Hurtful Lyer:
and yet you may say that I am a fauourable Iudge vnto you:
for if I had put thée to thy oth (as I might haue done verie wel)
I knowe thou wouldst haue forsworne thy self which fearing,
I did not require thée thereto: and then halfe thy goods shoulde
haue bin lost, which the King should haue had, and thy tongue
should haue bin cut out of thy head, for a periured person. Thus
<pb facs="tcp:10199:64"/>
thou maist perceiue I haue vsed thée gentlye. And then, the
Iudge saide to him to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the debte was due, howe long is it
since you firste required youre money of him?<note place="margin">Note this Iudgement.</note> forsooth my
Lorde saide he, two monethes and something more: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my
iudgemente is, saide the Iudge, that he shall paye you
your debte, whiche is tenne pounds, and for euery moneth
since so muche as the debte is, that is for euerye month tenne
pounds whiche amounteth in the whole to thyrtie poundes.
This is my iudgement, &amp; sée that yée performe it in any wise.
And the man vpon whom the iudgement was giuen, was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the Bar: but the Iudge said, sirra, you must stay a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
I haue another thing to say to you yet: &amp; then he called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him the other man, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he defrauded of his Farme, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
put him in trust to buy it for him. To whom the Iudge saide:
did you neuer desire to buy the Farme that this felow bought,
of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I gaue iudgement of late? yes my Lord, saide he, I was
verie desirous to buy it, but I was sicke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I coulde not goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute
it my selfe, and I spedde therafter: did you put no friend
of yours in trust, said the Iudge, to make the bargaine for you?
yes forsooth my Lord, said he: who was it said the Iudge? truly
my Lord, saide he, euen this same man that bought the same
Farme, whom I requested (for that I was sicke and not well
able to goe, and bycause I hadde a greater confidence in hym
than in anye other of my neighbours) to doe so muche for me,
to enquire of the manne that oughte the same, whether he
woulde sell hys Lease thereof or not, saying, I vnderstande
that he meaneth to putte it awaye, and bycause I dwel here
where I haue no certentie, and looke euerye daye to be
putte out of it, I will giue him for it as muche as it is
worthe with reason: and if you can not gette it vnder thirtie
pounds, I will giue it: and rather than I woulde goe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, I will giue him more: therefore I praye you, saide I,
driue the bargaine for me as nye as you may, &amp; make it vp for
me before you come home againe if you can. And then he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
me faithfully, that he woulde doe more for me than that,
<pb facs="tcp:10199:65"/>
and he went thither, and when he came home, he tolde me that
though before he was determined to sel it, then he would in no
wise depart withal: were you the first that tolde him of it, saide
the Iudge: yea my Lord saide he, thereof I am sure: wel saide
the Iudge, what house bought you then to dwel in? forsooth my
Lord, said he, within a while after he came vnto me, and prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred
me his Farme, saying that he had another Farme promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him, aboue twentie miles hence: and so, I for lacke of a
house was constrayned to paye vnto him, his owne price for
his Farme, whiche was fortie pounds, thoughe it were not
halfe so good as the Farme that he hath n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>we, for which as I
vnderstande he paide but twentie pounds: yea said the Iudge,
and if he might haue gone forwarde as he beganne, he woulde
haue paide but tenne pounds: saying further, this geare I feare
will fal out but madly, for it beginneth verie suspitiously. How
long was it after, said the Iudge, ere you entred into his house?
forsooth my Lorde, saide hée, a quarter of a yeare and more, and
when I was enforst of necessity to come thither to dwel, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
me to stay from co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming thither for one seuenight, &amp; to let
him remaine there so long, for saide he, I was disappointed of
the Farme twentie miles hence, wherof I told you, but I hope
to get another shortly: and so I was content to lette him tarrie
there for so long, and when I came to dwel there at the ende of
the Seuenight, he had almost remoued all his goods and stuffe
from thence: and then I asked him where he had gotten a house
so quickly: marie neighbor said he, I haue got the same Farme,
that you willed me to buye for you, the Lease wherof I bought
but within thys foure or fiue dayes. And thus as, he said, hée
gotte the Farme, whiche at the first I desired him to gette for
me. Indéede saide the Iudge, a man maye be in good hope of a
house, when alreadie he is sure of one of his owne: I smel saide
the Iudge this geare welynough. A Iugler by his trinckets is
easie to be knowen. Then saide the Iudge to the fellow (vppon
whom lately he gaue iudgement) tel me truely and lye not (for
lyes are so deare that you were better tel truth) how long is it,
since thou boughtst the Farme thou now dwellest in? whereat
<pb facs="tcp:10199:65"/>
he helde his peace and spake neuer a worde: he is driuen into
such narrow roome, said the Iudge, that he can neither go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
nor forward, for if he say, he bought it when I thinke hee
did, then he bewrayeth himselfe: if he say he boughte it at suche
time as he tolde his neighbour that bought his Farme, then he
that solde it to him (he feareth) wil witnesse against him. Wel,
séeing you will not aunswere me, sayde the Iudge, I will sée
if another wil aunswere me: tel me, saide the Iudge to hym y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
solde him his Farme, how long is it since he bought his Farm
of you? my Lorde saide he, it is almost fiue monthes since, for
on such a day, I receiued the tenne pounds of him for the same:
then sayde the Iudge to the other that bought the craftie felows
Farme, howe long doe you thinke it since you sente your saide
neighbour to buye or conclude for the same Farme for you? for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth,
saide he, my Lorde I am sure it was about the same time.
Then, said the Iudge, I haue another witnesse here that wil I
trow agree with you both: and then he looked on the quittance,<note place="margin">A good witnes.</note>
and he founde that it was dated and sealed the same daye that
the man saide he receiued his money, loe, said the Iudge, how
iumpe and iustly is truth tryed by tryall: if falshod be not su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borned
with friendship, money, or giftes, she could neuer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
as in many places she doeth. These craftie and wicked
wretches, do tie one mischiefe to another, &amp; linke diuelish pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
togither: for when this craftie fellowe had defrauded hys
neighbour that putte him in truste of the Farme, he lefte not
there, but practised to deceiue this other man of the one halfe
of hys money: and whereas he solde him hys Farme, whyche
woulde bring hym to wealth: he practised to beguile hym of his
money to bring him to pouertie: therefore stande neare, sayde
the Iudge, thou false and craftie fellowe, I muste néeds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede
againe againste thée in iudgement, and the seconde iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente
will be worse than the first. And now for that thou didst
make a lye to thy neighbour, whiche put thée in truste, telling
hym that this manne woulde not sell the Lease of his Farme,
whereby thou deceiuedst him, and boughte it from him, (which
lye was to his great hindrance, and the cause he had it not) my
<pb facs="tcp:10199:66"/>
iudgement, is that for the space of two monthes more, for thys
only, without any paying any thing to him (for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as the matter
falleth out, he shal be otherwaies reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st) thou shalt not speak
to any body, vnlesse before a Iudge or Ruler, as is before said.
And shal also al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> while weare on thy sléeue, and an <hi>H.</hi> &amp; an <hi>L</hi> for a
Hurtful Lyer: &amp; bicause thou hast deceiued thy neighbor of the
Farme, which he put thée in trust to buy for him, therefore my
iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he shal haue the Lease of the same, &amp; enioy it as
wel as though he had bought it: paying to thée againe the xx. <abbr>l.</abbr>
which thou hast &amp; must pay for it: &amp; bycause thou didst giue lesse
than thy neighbour did offer for it, by .x. <abbr>l.</abbr> therefore he shal oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie
&amp; enioy thy Farme, which thou sold vnto thy neighbour,
for the space of ten yeres. And sée that thou performe this iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as thou wilt auoyde a greter danger. And as thou likest
this, saide the Iudge, deceiue thy neighbour againe, that doeth
put thée in trust.</p>

and wil trauel therein as much as I am able, I
doubting neuer a whit to bring this your desire to passe. Then
saide his father, if thou dost wel for me, thou canst not do ill for

spéede, and thou shalt carrie so much money with thée, as wyll
purchase the same: and in any wise purchase it in my name, to

priuie Espials, that trauel purposely through his whole Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
only secretely to learne and search out such notorious

and surely searched out by their trauel, and they do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:10199:67"/>
giue to the king in writing the names and places, where they
dwel, that so offend: but also their names and dwelling places,
that are so molested &amp; misused: to which priuy Spials the King
giues great liuings, and also bountiful rewards.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>If such Spials were with vs, out of doubt one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>Yea but how can they kil them before they do know
them? These Spials are charged on paine of death, not to vtter
or reueale the cause of their trauell: for none but the King him
selfe doth knowe them that are appointed for this purpose. So
that it can not bée knowne, vnlesse they reueale it them selues.
And moreouer, these Espials dare not certifie the King of any
vntruthe, for if they doe, they shall die for it: therfore it standeth
them vppon to learne and search out the matter aduisedly and
diligently, and to bée of a good and sure ground, before they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the King thereof. And to make the sayde Espials to bée the
more diligent in their trauell &amp; triall out of such notorious mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours,
and wicked practises: the moe matters that they
haue to certifie the King, the moe gifts and rewardes they shal
haue of the King, for the King giueth euery one of them a libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
rewarde for euery such notorious fault, practise, or misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour,
that they so declare vnto him. And the King him self
in his owne person, hath the hearing, determining, and iudging
of euery such notorious fact or matter, that is informed him by
his saide Espials. And by these meanes, wicked deceiuers and
diuelish practisers are iustly punished by the King: &amp; the opres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and defrauded are reuenged, restored, and helped, thoughe
they themselues do not complaine.</p>

               <p>What a worthie order and notable policie is this?
wherby the wicked is punished, the innocent helped, and truth

that bestoweth himself such liberall giftes to such fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
out of faultes, wherby all this is accomplished. I woulde
to God we had such Spials with vs, to trauell abroad to learne

hir small drinke: whiche he did not refuse, but thanked hir for
hir gentlenesse. And then shée brought him into hir poore house,
and did sette before him bread and chéese, and brought him such
drinke as she hadde, whereof he did both eate and drinke well.
And whyles hée was sitting there, hée demaunded of the sayde
Woman, what Countrie woman she was? Who tolde him,
that shée was not borne far from thence. And then he asked hir
if the got all hir liuing with spinning? Yea, saide she, I thanke
God for it: for though it bée a poore trade, yet it is a true trade.
But sir, said shée, though I bee now in such a poore case, I haue
bene in a great deale better. Howe then came you thus empo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerished,
saide he? Truly I will tell you, sayde shée, the whole
matter, if it were not for troubling of you. Nay, said he againe,
it will bée no trouble to mée, nor harme to you: therefore tell
the truth in all pointes as nigh as you can, for if I can doe you
no good, assure your selfe I will doe you no harme. Sir, I doe
not tell it vnto you, saide she, to the intent to haue any redresse
thereby, but only to shewe the simple state I am nowe in, and
the case I was in before, concerning prosperitie or worldlie fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie.
It was my chaunce when I was not past nine or tenne
yeares of age, to be caried by a frende of my father and mother,
a hundreth miles hence at the leaste, to be brought vppe with a
Gentlewoman, who loued me very well, bicause I was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
obedient and diligente vnto hir: whose seruice I chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
not for any, but tarried still with my saide Mystresse vntil
shée died. I being then about thrée or foure and twentie yeares
of age, my Maister was made a Knighte, whereby his Wyfe
<pb facs="tcp:10199:68"/>
was a Ladie at hir death: Who a little before hir death sente
for hir husbande to come and speake with hir: and hée (as shée
desired,) came presently vnto hir: at whiche time shée toke him
fast by the hande, and sayde: Sir, I féele my selfe now so sick,
that I knowe I shall not long bée your Wyfe, and I trust that
you can not say, but that euer since our mariage I haue bene a
true, louing and obediente Wyfe vnto you. And as I neuer
requested any thing of you of any greate importaunce, so nowe
at my death I praye you graunte mée a boone, which you may
easilye perfourme. And I assure you sir, sayde shée, it wyll be
no euill, but good, and not to your hindraunce, but greately for
your profite, ioye, and quietnesse. What is it wyfe? sayde he,
and then I will tell you whether I will or not. Nay, said shée,
I beseech you graunt it mée before, it wil be no more harme to
you than I haue sayde, therefore if euer you loued mée deny me
not. Which when he hearde hir desire so earnestly, knowing
also that shée woulde will him to nothing, that shoulde hurt or
hinder him, sayde as followeth: Wife, for as much as I know
that thou loueste mée dearelye, and wishest mée well, I wyll
graunte it thée whatsoeuer it bée, if it lye in my power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme.
Yes sir, sayd shée, or else I would not demaund you
to doe it. And nowe this it is: I haue broughte vppe a poore

you, and fauour to mée, that shée hath loued our children moste
tenderly. And for that I shall leaue behinde me two young moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlesse
children, and an other that is our eldest sonne of riper
yeares (whom I beséech God, he may be as toward and wel di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed
hereafter, as he is froward and euil disposed nowe) I am
much afrayde least the yong babes, by a stepmother should, bée
stepchildren: and that when you their father were abrode, they
<pb facs="tcp:10199:69"/>
should be misused at home. And as I haue a gret care for them,
so I haue no small regarde vnto you,<note place="margin">A strange sute.</note> fearing leaste you shoulde
marry one that rather loueth your liuing than your self, as you
shal bée allured thereto I am sure, wherby you should not only
muche misse mée, for your owne quietnesse and ease: but also for
the good looking too and well bringing vp of our children. And
for that I knowe none that will obey you, loue you and regard
you so muche as I, neither make so muche of our children, and
haue such care of them as I, excepte it be this my seruaunte, of
whose faithfulnesse, honestie, loue, and modestie I haue hadde
such trial, that it is very harde to finde hir matche: therfore my
most humble and laste sute vnto you is, to marrye this my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
and Maide after my death, at such time as you shal think
conuenient and méete, which I doubt not but you will doe, for
that you haue promised mee. And then he saide to hir againe:
For as muche as I haue promised you to perfourme your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
I will God willing marrie hir, if it be your chance to die
before mée. And within a whyle after, my good Ladie and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse
died, and then my Maister according to his promise, did
marrie mée, with whom I liued after aboue twentie yeares in
great worship, quietnesse, and wealth: whome I so loued and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed,
that hée thought he had his first wife. And I brought vp
his children so carefully and tenderly, that they neuer myssed
their owne moother. Then sayde the Kings Espiall, to whom
shée tolde the tale: If this be true, then you are a Ladie stil, for
though you haue lost your liuing by some missehappe, yet you
can not lose your title by any mischaunce. A poore Lady, sayde
she, that is faine to spinne for hir liuing. And when I had bene
married to this worthy Gentleman and Knight more than .xx.
yeares, God toke him away by a sicknesse that hée hadde, to my
great griefe and sorrowe, yea, and to my vtter vndoing: as you
shall perceiue hereafter. For my husbandes eldest sonne, who
neither estéemed his father nor loued mée, after his father was
dead, brought me by fairs wordes, to walke with him into my
grounde, and when hée hadde me in a little groue of Wood, hée,
stripped mée out of all my cloathes, and putte vppon mée suche
<pb facs="tcp:10199:69"/>
simple attyre as hée hadde prepared for the purpose, and
saide: a beggar my father founde thée, and a beggar hys
sonne will leaue thée: thou haste hadde pleasure y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to be a Lady these twentie yeares, therfore therest
of thy life, thou shalt playe the beggar, leaste thou forgette
from whence thou camest: dost thou thinke to haue anye of
my fathers liuing? no I warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thée. And as it hath greued
me to sée thée in my mothers place all this while, so nowe
it doth reioice mée to sée thée in these beggars ragges. And
then I knéeled on my knées, and began to speake vnto him,
but he would not suffer me, saying: if thou prate to me one
word that I like not, I wil kil thée: therefore if thou wilte
haue thy life, thou shalte promise and sweare vnto me, that
thou shalt neuer sue me in any Courte for any landes or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
here, neither shalte thou complaine to anye Iudge of
this that I nowe doe to thée: and moreouer, with as much
spéede, to goe out of this countrey, and that thou shalte not
dwell within a hundred miles of this place: all whiche, if
thou wilt not sweare to performe, here I wil dispatch thée
and hereaue thée of thy life. And then I,<note place="margin">A compelled othe.</note> for the safegarde
of my life did sweare vnto him, that all this I woulde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,
and so haue I done euer since vntill this daye: for I
wente then from thence in all the haste I coulde, partly for
feare of my life, but chiefly for kéeping my othe, and here I
haue dwelled euer since, wythoute complayning to anye
Iudge of this greate wrong and iniury he hath done to me,
and without suing or troubling him for my liuing (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to my othe) whiche he kéepeth moste wrongfullye and
wickedly from me. And thus sir, saide she, thoroughe mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string
of talke, you know by what occasion I am come to
this pore estate, yet as wel contented withall, saide she, as
when I was in my greatest prosperitie. It is maruel, said
he, that you doe not finde some meanes to get your lyuing
or some parte of it. Alas sir, saide she, I neuer looke to haue
any of it, neither do meane, according to my othe, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
to any Iudge or Magistrate aboute it. A constrained
<pb facs="tcp:10199:70"/>
othe by Gods lawe and mans lawe is counted as no othe,
said he: therfore, I tell you truely, if it were my case as it is
yours, I woulde séeke some remedie to ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>te it: what is
the Gentlemans name; and where doeth he dwell that
thus did vse you? saide he. And then she tolde him both hys
name, and the place where he dwelled. But I thinke, said
she, he is dead by this time: therefore, saide shée, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
him and I doe, Surely, sayde hée, God wyll blesse
you the better; bicause you take al these iniuries so patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And now, saide he, for youre good refreshing of mée I
most hartily thanke you, And if it may lye in my power to

Which being bolted out by them a far off, without any sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition,
he made hast to the Court, being very glad that he
had such a matter wherof to certifie the King. And as soone
as he came to the Court, watching his time when he might

a maide or a widowe, a Gentlewoman or a base borne? for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth,
saide the Gentleman, she was, as I iudge of no highe
degrée, for she was but my fathers seruaunt, and as for hir
kinred wée knewe not: it séemed by hir attyre at hir firste
comming, that hir parents were but pore. Howe chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
it that youre father (said the King) being a Knight, and
a man of so greate a liuing and good worship, would marry
his seruant, or one of so base a calling? Truely, saide the
Gentleman, my mother on hir death bed, for the great loue
&amp; affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she bare to hir, desired my father to grant hirone
request before she died: who, thinking she woulde desire no
such thing, graunted hir that he woulde do whatsoeuer she
desired, if it lay in his power to performe: and then, when
he had graunted hir, she required him to marry hir maide
after hir death: and so he did performe the promise he made
to my mother. Then saide the King, your father was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good to hir, for in one houre he made hir of a pore serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
a worshipfull Lady, and of a pore maide, a rich Mistresse.
He did so, saide the Gentleman. Then saide the King: Is
she dead or aliue? I thinke she be dead, saide the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
Doe you not knowe perfectly, saide the King? no,
I knowe not perfectly, but that I surmize, for if shée were
aliue, she woulde come or sende to receiue hir Rentes, for
hir liuing shoulde be great if she were aliue: for my father
loued hir so wel, that he made hir a Ioynter of more than
halfe his liuing: besides that, he left hir worth in goodes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
two or thrée thousande pounds, but she neuer had nor
enioyde any of it: for soone after my fathers death, she went
away, but howe, I knowe not, and I neuer hearde of hir
since. I like you well, saide the King, that you tell me the
truth: it séemeth, that she had better lucke during your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
life than she had after his death. How long was she
married to your father? saide the King: forsooth, saide hée,
aboue twentie yeares. Did your mother leaue anye moe
children than you? yea, saide he, she lefte two that were but
yong. And was she a good mother to you, said the King, and
<pb facs="tcp:10199:71"/>
vsed you and them well? Yea very well, said he: our own
mother coulde not haue loued nor vsed vs better. It is
very strange, saide the King, that no body could tel neither
of hir death, nor yet howe she shoulde be conueyed awaye:
truely, saide the Gentlemanne, I made as greate search
and enquirie for hir as I coulde possibly, but I coulde neuer
learne what became of hir. The most wisest men haue sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
that some did, by some wile, steale and conuey hir a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
against hir wil, for hir great wealth and liuing, and for
that she woulde not consent, haue killed hir, fearing leaste
she shoulde bewraye them, if they shoulde haue let hir go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from them. It may be so, saide the King, it is verye
likely. Wel, saide the King, this is the cause I haue sent
for you by my Purseuaunt:<note place="margin">The King spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth politikly.</note> it was credibly told, (belike by
some that beare you no good will, and perhappes doe it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of malice than of anye good matter) that you haue kyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
hir, or caused hir to be killed: but if you be sure you haue
not (as I beléeue you would not, for that you tolde me how
well she loued and vsed you) assure youre selfe to bée with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
al daunger. But leaste I be suspected, said the King, of
parcialitie, you must be content to be as a prisoner a while,
vntill I sée that it cannot be proued, whiche I will quickly
trie, doubt you not: therefore content your selfe, sayde the
King, for they that haue thus slandred you shall dearly pay
for it, if they cannot be able to proue it. Then said the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
to the King: God saue your lyfe, O worthy Prince,
for I neuer killed hir, nor conse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted euer thereto: therfore I
am certaine and sure, that it can neuer be proued: wherfore
I nowe reioice, thoughe I was sorie before I knewe the
matter. And then the King sent him away to prison.</p>

               <p>This was a very good policie of the King, to
pretende hir death against him, which he knew was false,
whereby to haue a good occasion to send him to prison, and
thereby to kéepe him safe, and to make him the lesse suspect
the trueth, or that she was aliue, whereby he might be the

               <p>You saye true: And after that the King exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Iudge &amp; Iustices of Peace seuerally by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues:
and they al affirmed, that the Knight, the said Gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
father, didde marry his maide at his wiues requeste on hir
death bed: but what became of hir after the death of hir
husbande, they knew not. And he commaunded after, that
the said Gentleman, with the Iudge and Iustices of peace
should be brought before him: and when they were al come
he saide to the saide Gentleman: Howe say you? saide the
King, it is credibly told me, that you haue killed your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in lawe: whiche is very like, for thoughe she vsed you
and your brethren as hir owne déere and louing children:
yet I vnderstande, that you did not onelye in your fathers
time maruellously misuse hir, but also, your owne louing
father, whome you were moste bounde to loue and obey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all other. Nowe séeing you didde hate and despise
hir whome your father entirely loued in your fathers life,
by displeasing of whome, you mighte haue bene displaced
out of al your inheritaunce and liuing: then it is like, after
his death when hée coulde not disinherite you howe cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly
soeuer you handled hir, that either you haue killed hir
your selfe, or appointed some other to doe it. Then said the
Gentleman, if it can be proued (O worthy King) that ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I killed hir my selfe, or got any other to kil hir, or was
euer consenting to hir death, either doe know of hir death:
then let me suffer the moste vilest death that can be inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And I truste your Maiestie, saide he, woulde not haue
me molested or troubled for hir death, vnlesse it be proued
that either I killed hir, or procured hir death, or consented
to it. No, saide the King, as God is a righteous king in
Heauen, so I hope I haue bene and will be a iuste Prince
in my kingdome on earth. Well, saide the King, if I can
not bring a witnesse, that she was killed, yet I beléeue I
can shortely haue one to testifie, that she escaped with great
feare: so that, if shée bée aliue, it is manifest then that you
are not culpable of hir death. I am sure, saide the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb facs="tcp:10199:72"/>
there is none that can witnesse any such thing against
me in any suche thing: neither, that I euer gaue hir anye
suche occasion. I wil not say it was you, saide the King, the
witnesses, if there be any, can tell their owne tale. But I
pray you, saide the King, tell me one thing, and lye not.
Then saide the Gentleman, if your Maiestie aske me that
I am able to resolue, I will: then saye vnto mée, saide the
Kyng, whether had you rather your mother in lawe were
aliue or dead? whereat he paused a little: Youre pausing,
saide the King, portendeth something, for if you were frée
from killing hir, then hir death could not hurt you: and if
you haue not otherwayes misused hir, then hir life can not
harme you Your Grace, said the Gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, doth construe
it one way, but I meant an other way: for if she were dead,
then by surmises and other presumptions, I mighte incur
great trouble and danger, wherof hir life would rid me:
and if she were aliue, I shoulde lose a greate parte of my
lyuing, whyche I nowe enioy and possesse. Then said
the King, herein you haue shewed rather a readye witte,
than a good excuse: for you that are loathe to haue hir a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue
that so muche loued and tendred you, leaste shée
shoulde enioye halfe youre liuing: it is to bée thoughte,
that you coulde bée contente to procure hir death, whom
you vtter lye hated, to haue all hir liuing. And for as
muche as the question séemeth so doubtfull to you, that you
knowe not whether it were better for you to haue hir dead
or aliue: it is like, that you are guiltie of hir death, or
abused hir in hir life. Wel, saide the King, bring me hither
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pore woman, we wil sée what she can say. And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pore
Lady his mother in law, in hir pore attire, was broght be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the King. And then the King asked the Gentleman if
he knewe hir: and he saide, he knewe hir not. Doe you
knowe thys Gentleman? sayde the Kyng to hir: If it
lyke your Grace, saide shée, I knowe him wel. Yea,
sayde the King, it liketh mée well that you knowe him:
But perhappes it lyketh hym euyll that you knowe
<pb facs="tcp:10199:73"/>
him: tel me truth, saide the King, when and where did you
sée him laste? Forsooth said she in a Groue, not farre from
his house where he dwelleth. What certaine token, saide
the King, can you shewe me, that then you sawe him? then
saide she, I haue suche a sure token that he cannot forgett<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
it. Tell it I pray you, saide the King. Then the pore La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
saide: it was my chaunce on a certaine euening to be in
the same Groue gathering a fewe stickes, and sodainely I
sawe this Gentleman (thoughe he sawe not me, for I did
couer my selfe close in a bramble bushe) and his mother in
lawe was there with him, whom he then stripped of al hir
apparel, and put on hir backe pore beggarly attyre (I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel
where he had it) (where gote the Diuel the Friar, said
the King?) and did then threaten to kill hir with his Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in his hande, if she woulde not then faithfully promise
and sweare to him, that she shoulde not onely gette hir selfe
from thence in all haste, and neuer come againe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
an hundreth miles of the same place: but also, that shée
shoulde neuer vtter the same to anye Iudge, neyther euer
claime any part of hir liuing there. And when she beganne
moste humbly to knéele and speake to him, he saide, if shée
prated to him, he woulde thruste his Dagger in hir. Then
the pore Ladye was commaunded to departe for a while.
How like you this tale? said the King, she might wel be a
good mother to you, but you shewed your self herein a step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>childe
to hir. Did not I saye before, that his silence dydde
shewe then, that eyther he was guiltie of hir death, or abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
hir in hir life? Then saide the King, what saist thou to
this thou wicked wretche? why doest thou not answere for
thy selfe? Then he saide, I beséeche your Grace not to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
this pore woman. As thoughe, saide the King none is
to be beléeued but the riche: and none to be discredited but
the pore. I doe not saye that she is to be discredited for hir
pouertie, said the Gentleman, but I meane that hir pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
may make hir to be allured with giftes and money, to
beare false witnesse. It is well knowne, saide the king, that
<pb facs="tcp:10199:73"/>
that good Lady thy mother in lawe, had neither kith nor kin
nighe thée, to sue, trauel, or to search for hir, and to boulte
out the truth. And moreouer, canst thou make me beleue,
that this pore woman durste witnesse a falshode to me, or
to accuse thée, (being of so greate liuing and wealth) of su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>
a crime, if it were not true? I doe not saye to your Grace,
that she is hired to beare witnesse against me, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
likely, that throughe giftes and rewardes she is allured
thereto. Wherefore I moste humbly beséeche your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
not to beleue, that I haue missused my good mother in
lawe in this sorte when she was aliue. Doest thou thinke,
saide the King, that she is dead? I beleue she is dead, said
he to the King: therefore let not me be troubled, for that I
neuer abused hir as this woman reporseth.</p>

               <p>Surely, this was verie wittily handled of the

               <p>As he beganne very wittily, so he ended the same
very wisely: for he appointed, that after the saide pore Lady
shoulde putte on hir trimme apparell, and shewe hir selfe in
suche sorte as she was in hir prosperitie. And then the King
saide: thoughe you refuse this pore woman for a witnesse, I
trust you wil not refuse a rich Gentlewoman for a witnesse.
Bring in that Gentlewoman, said the King, before me. And
when this pore Lady came in trimme attyre like a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
or a Lady, before the King: the King asked hir, if
shée knewe that Gentlemanne. Yea, my moste worthie
Soueraigne, I knowe hym verye wel, saide she. Doe you
knowe this Gentlewoman? said the King to the Gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Then said the Gentleman verie softely and sorrowfully, I
knowe hir. Doe you knowe hir? said the King to the Iudge
and to the other Iustices of Peace: yea, saide they, we know
hir verye wel, for she hathe made vs verye good cheare in hir
husbandes time: it was verie well bestowed on you, saide
the King. This is a very strange thing, saide he, the riche
and wealthie can not knowe the poore, but suche as are rich
or equall to themselues. And if anye come from wealth to
<pb facs="tcp:10199:74"/>
pouerty the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they quite forget the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but if they come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to welth, then quickly they know the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This Gentlewoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is the same woman she was herebefore, &amp; yet hir trim appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
hath made hir another woman: she had the self same face,
armes, and legges, that she hath now, and yet they knew hir
not: &amp; for that she hath other aparel, that she had not before,
now they knowe hir. Well Gentleman, I may wel punish
you for missusing hir when she was aliue: but here afore all
this company, I acquit you for hir death. Though these two
women are but one witnesse in déede, yet you your selfe haue
allowed them for two witnesses. For the first that was here
you knew not, and this gentlewoman that is here you know:
which argueth plainely that you take them to be two seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
persons. And thus they may be as two witnesses against
you: but this good missused Gentlewoman your mother in
Law, is the most sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t witnesse y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> can be brought against
you in this case. But I praye you Gentlewoman, saide the
King, why did you suffer this iniurie at his hands, all thys
while? forsooth, saide she, it may please your highnesse to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande,
that partly I was lothe to vndoe him, though he
spoyled me of all I hadde: and partly I was so scrupulous to
kéepe my othe, thoughe I was enforced to make it, that if it
had not bene reuealed by some other meanes than by mine
owne procuremente, he shoulde neuer haue bene bewrayed
for me. I know thou sayst true, saide y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King, for if it had not
bin boulted out, more by my meanes, than it was procured
by thine, thou shouldst haue liued poorely for want of thine
owne, and he shoulde haue liued Lordlye, with that, that
is thine. Then the Gentleman knéeled downe and beganne
to excuse himselfe: wherewith the King was verye angrie,
and sayde, pratle no more to me, said the King, thou wouldst
haue killed this Gentlewomanne with thy dagger, for spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in hir right: and shall I suffer thée to lyue, if thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
before me to excuse thy selfe in wickednesse and wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g?
wilt thou vrge me to séeke for further witnesse? bring me
saide he, hither before me all this Gentlemans seruauntes,
<pb facs="tcp:10199:74"/>
that came vp with him: And as soone as they came before
the King, he asked which of them did dwell with him at the
death of his Father, or at the time when the Ladye his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Law was so sodainely gone. And one of them which
then dwelled with him, saide: it maye please your maiestie
to vnderstande, that at that time I was his seruaunte and
wayted on him: then sayde the king, loke thou tel me truth
in that I shal aske thée, didst thou knowe nothing of hir de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture?
neyther didst thou sée any thing whereby to suspect
thy maister thereof? Truely saide his seruante, I sawe my
maister and hir walke togither out of the house, on whome
I would then haue wayted, but he woulde not suffer me, &amp;
within an houre after, I met my maister, with some of hyr
clothes in his armes, which I was sure she did weare, when
she and he went forth togither. And I asked hym what hée
had there, and where he had left my Lady his mother: and
he sayde to me agayne, what wouldst thou withall knaue?
she is none of my mother. And euery one did mutter of hyr
thus soddaine absence: at the laste I sayde vnto him, sir it
woulde be muche for your worshippe, to make searche for
my Ladye: let hyr kindred and friendes searche for hyr,
sayde he, for I wyll neyther goe nor sende, out of the dores
to looke for hir. And this is verye true that I tell
your grace, but more I know not. Thys is ynough, saide
the King, and more than I looked for, but not more than
God woulde: beholde throughe gods prouidence, thyne
owne man hath tolde such a tale that it hath tryed all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> rest
to be true. With that the Gentlemanne was ashamed and
helde downe hys head. Nowe, sayde the King, he holdeth
downe hys heade, whyche in déede is more méete for
hym, than to hold it vp: he hath vsed thys good Lady so wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly,
&amp; so trecherously, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not wel loke vp to take God
for his father, me for his Prince, this Lady for hys mother,
nor any good man here to be his friend. Ah varlet, thou hast

<pb facs="tcp:10199:75"/>
gote by well doing: doste thou not knowe, that in this my
Kingdome of <hi>Mauqsun</hi> are such good lawes and orders, and
suche worthie Iudges and Officers, that wicked practises
cannot be vnreuealed, fraude and falshode not defended or
bolstred, and that the offenders are not long vnpunished? I
tell thée, that God dothe so abhorre the wronging of the
widowe, the defrauding of the fatherlesse, the oppressing of
the pore, and the misusing of the miserable, that he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale
it, thoughe the craftie worldlings, with all their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie
and power doe hide it, as by this pore missused Lady
doeth manifestly appeare: for she of hir selfe thought neuer
to vtter it, but God of his goodnesse wrought means to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe
it. Well, saide the King, I will make thée a spectacle

thée.<note place="margin">Marke the iudgement of the King.</note> And firste, bycause thou haste made diuers lies to me,

               <p>Yea, what else? for as he had prepared before beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly
attyre for his mother, so the King commaunded suche
like attyre to be purposely prepared for him: which beggar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attyre, when the King sawe on his backe, he saide: now
thou arte dressed as thou shouldest be: for as thou hast done
vnto hir, so I doe vnto thée. And bycause, saide the King,
thou diddest spoyle hir of all hir landes, liuing, money,
goodes, iewels and plate, and turned hir to spinne for hir li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing:
<pb facs="tcp:10199:75"/>
so here I wil take from thée all thy landes, goodes, ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels,
money and plate, whiche she shall possesse and enioy
all hir life, and all hir owne goodes and iewels, to bestowe
where she wil after hir death, and so thou shalte be turned
abroad, to get thy liuing which way thou canst. And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
thou didst charge hir vpon hir othe, that she shoulde not
dwell nighe thée by an hundreth myles: so I charge and
commaunde thée vppon thine allegiaunce, that thou shalt
dwell from hir an hundreth myles at the leaste. And for
that thou diddest vnlady hir, by taking away hir apparell,
liuing, and goodes: nowe I vngentleman thée, by taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
thy apparell, thy lands, and thy goodes from thée. But
thoughe my iudgement is, that thou shalte haue none of
thy goodes or landes during thy life: yet my will is, that
thy children, if thou haste or shalte haue any, shall enioy al
the same, after this Ladies death. And all this my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
shal stande and be performed, and not be reuoked.
And nowe, said the King to the Iudge and Iustices, I haue
to say to you: for as muche as this Lady was so sodainely
gone away, the bruite whereof you coulde not choose but
heare: and bicause you caused not enquiry or search for hir,
thoughe none complained thereof to you, whiche was your
partes to haue done, (for good Iudges and Iustices ought
to enquire and searche priuily for misdemeanors,) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
euery one of you, as well Iudges as Iustices, I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of your Offices and authoritie, commaunding eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of you besides, to finde two of your porest neighbors
children at schoole for the space of two yeares, allowing
them all that while, sufficient meate, drincke, cloth,
and all other necessaries, as well for theyr learning, as
for their finding, commaunding euery one of you to doe,
and performe this my iudgement, as you will auoyde
our indignation. For whyche worthy iudgemente, the
said pore Ladye moste humbly thanked the King: and al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Kings Subiectes that hearde of it, reioiced that
they were subiectes to suche a politike, diligent, righteous,
<pb facs="tcp:10199:76"/>
wise and vertuous a Prince. And then the King departed:
the Lady to hir owne, liuing and goodes was restored, and
to all hyr landes admitted: hir wicked sonne in lawe of all
goodes and landes dispossessed, and into a straunge country
banished: the Iudge and Iustices oute of their authoritie

               <p>Forsooth, as the other that practise &amp; commit wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse,
are punished, &amp; according to the lawe executed: so
these are, by the king to promotion and greate authoritie
preferred: and the other that are godly, wise, and well lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
are to one office or other promoted, thoughe they be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so pore: for the kyng thinkes, that they that are content
with a pore and base liuing, and séeke not to be exalted, wil
if they be in any aucthoritie, doe Iustice and equitie, and
wil abhorre to take giftes and rewardes.</p>

               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>Your king thinketh truly: yet it is often times
séene, that many before they be in office and authoritie, doe
<pb facs="tcp:10199:76"/>
professe that with their tongue, that when they are in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
they neuer performe in their déedes. But sir, as you told
me before, that the suters in the lawe with you haue not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
quicke dispatch of their matters, but also haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ended
&amp; determined with small costs and charges: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so I thinke,
that suche as haue an occasion to sue vnto any noble man or
other, for any particular thing to themselues, are quicklye
dispatched either off or on.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>That is most certaine, for this order we haue: as
soone as any thing is giuen or granted, either by any Noble
man, Lorde, or other, the same is registred immediatelye, to
whome it is giuen or graunted (yea, and our King himselfe
doth vse that order) whereby none is putte in hope of that
whiche before is promised, or giuen to an other: So that if
it be promised or giuen before, the suter hathe his answeare
verie spéedily, that it is giuen, or that he can not haue it.
If the thing he sueth for be not giuen or promised: then our
order is, that they to whome he doeth sue, shall eyther gyue
him an aunsweare within a daye after, or else shall appoint
him an other day.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>It maye be, that the Suter dwelleth two or
thrée hundreth miles from the same place, wanting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
perhappes to tarrie long for an aunswere, or else
can not so well trauaile so farre agayne for his aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, thrée daies is the longest that anye Suter
with vs shall be constrained to tarry for an aunswere: for
if hée haue not an aunsweare within thrée dayes, he shall
haue the thing he sueth for.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>There maye a greate inconuenience aryse
thereof, for thereby manye tymes the Suter shoulde be
driuen to departe wythoute his demaunde: or else hée,
to whome the Sute is made, shoulde bée vrged to
giue or graunte that to one that is vnworthie of it: for that in
suche a shorte time it could not be learned of what nature,
<pb facs="tcp:10199:77"/>
qualitie, or condition the suter is.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>If that be all the matter that you can alleage, the
aunsweare néede not be long delayed: for euery one with vs
muste of force bring a good Certificate or Testimonial, that
he is very méete and worthy of the thing he sueth for, or else
he cannot speede of the thing he sueth for: For good Reporte
with vs doth winne that, that Money nor Giftes can neuer
attaine.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>That is very wel: but I tell you truely, with vs
it proueth ofte times contrarie: for that which good Report
or Desertes can not get in a yeare, Money and Giftes will
get in a day. Wel, it is no greate matter for a man to staye
thrée dayes to spéede well. And to saye trueth, it is a greate
deale better for one to tarrye thrée dayes, and then to haue
a flatte aunsweare not to truste vnto it, than to be putte in
hope with faire promises a tweluemoneth, and then to goe
home without it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>I dare saye that there are none so euill vsed

            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>I feare there haue béene a hundred within lesse
than a hundred yeares, being fedde with faire wordes, that
haue waited long, spent muche money, and giuen rewards,
and yet haue gone home withoute the thing they sued for:
and an other (perhappes not so worthye) in two or thrée
dayes, with small wayting, and little expences hath obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>Surely, that is againste all reason: it is a pitiful
thing, to make one spende his time, and consume his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
for that he shal not haue. Long delaying of suters, hathe
oftentimes made them lose and spende more, than the thing
hathe béene worth they sued for or got, which is a greate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normitie,
and against al reason. Now, if that be against rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
then it is much more againste both reason &amp; equitie, to
make one throgh vaine hope, to wait long, to lose their time,
to spende all they are able to make, for that they shall not
haue, which is the next way to driue them to beg of other, of
<pb facs="tcp:10199:77"/>
whome other before did beg.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>You say euen truly, yet many with vs haue bene so
serued: I pray God it may so cease, and that none hereafter bée
so serued. But I beséech you tel mée, how do pore Suters with
you, that haue no mony to spende during the time of their sute
or complaint?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>Though there be fewe such with vs, yet they that be
such can lacke no reliefe nor lodging all that while. For many
godly Gentlemen, Rich men, and Merchantes of the Citie, do
require the Porters of the same, to sende vnto them suche poore
strangers and néedie Suters, as they espie when they first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in at the Gates of the City: which godly Gentlemen, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
and Rich men, will not only ioyfully receiue them, but
also will giue them meate, drinke, and lodging, during all the
time they sue, or are Suters. So that no poore Suter can so
soone enter into any Towne or Citie with vs: but straightway
they are thus entertained either of one or other. Are they not so
with you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>With vs, quoth you? we would be loath to be taken
with such a fault: if they come without mony, they are liker to
lie on bare boords than on a featherbed. And they shal not light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
surffet on their Supper.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>I will tell you a true tale of a worthie Iudge with
vs, and howe he did vse a poore woman that had great wrong,
and had no mony to relieue hir at all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>Tell it I beséeche you, for I will giue an attentiue

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>There was a Iudge with vs that feared God,<note place="margin">A rare Iudge.</note> and
loued equitie so much, that diuers times he would walk in the
streates early and late, in vnknowne apparel, only to spie pore
strangers and Suters, and to enquire of them the cause of their
trauell and sute: who on a certaine night mette in the streate a
poore aged Woman, who had a paper or wryting in hir hande.
To whome the Iudge said: Goodwoman where dwel you, and
what is the cause of your comming hither? Forsooth sayd shée,
I dwel in the Country, and am enforced to come hither to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
<pb facs="tcp:10199:78"/>
of a wicked Rich man that hath myssused my daughter
and I haue neyther mony to pay for foode nor lodging. Doest
thou knowe his name, and where he dwelleth? said the Iudge:
Yea that I do, saide shée, and then shée tolde him his name, and
where he dwelled. Where is your daughter? sayd he: she is in
the Towne, sayd the old woman. And then he did giue hir mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
in hir purse to pay for hir supper and lodging, &amp; willed hir
to enquire the next day for the chiefe Iudges house of the Citie,
and to come thither with hir daughter, for, said he, I wil speak
my selfe to the Iudge for you: and so shée was gladde, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
him greate thankes for the monie whiche hée reléeued hir
withall. And when the sayde Iudge came home, hée sente for
his Porter into his Chamber, to whome hée gaue strait charge,
that when such a poore Woman with hir Daughter came vnto
his Gate, hée should delay no time, but immediatly bring them
both vnto him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>I thinke the sayde poore Woman did not forgette, to
come with hir Daughter the next day to the Iudges house, as
she was appointed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>No I warrant you. And when she and hir daughter
came thither, the Porter broughte them before the Iudge pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently:
which poore woman when he sawe, he knewe hir well
ynough, though shée knewe him neuer a whitte. Tel me, sayd
the Iudge, what occasion had you to come to mée? whome she
answered, saying: It may please your Lordship to vnderstand,
that yesternight as I was walking in the streate, a good man
mette with mée, who did not only giue me mony to relieue me
and my daughter, but also told me that he would speake to you
concerning my cause and sute. Then he sayd: In déed one spake
to mée, and sayde, that such a Rich man hath missused thy dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghter,
and to complaine on him therfore was the onely cause of
your comming hither at this time. In déede, sayde shée, that is
true, therefore if it will please you to heare all the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and howe he hath abused my daughter, I will declare it as
briefly as I can. Tell it, saide the Iudge, and I will heare
thée willingly, for I am appointed to sit &amp; heare euerye bodies
<pb facs="tcp:10199:78"/>
complaint that commeth hither. Therefore be bolde to declar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
thy whole cause, and I will both heare thée willingly, and take
thy parte in right most spéedily. Then shée sayde: The Lorde
saue your life O worthie Iudge: but sayde the Iudge, doth not
thy complainte tende altogither to the myssusing of thy daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
Yes my Lorde, sayde shée. Then it were more requisite,
(saide the Iudge,) that thy daughter shoulde tell hir owne tale,
for none knoweth it better than shée. That is true, sayde the
pore Woman. And then the Iudge commaunded hir daughter
to speake, and to reueale all the truthe of the matter vnto him.
And then hir daughter sayde to the Iudge as followeth: My
Lorde, this noughtie Riche and vnmerciful man, which is my
moothers neighboure, walked of late through a Groue of his, in
whiche (through my mothers commaundement) I was gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a fewe olde and rotten sticks, to make my moother and me
a fire at home (for it was verye colde weather) who when hée
sawe mée, hée was in suche a rage and furie with mée, that my
humble knéeling on my knées coulde not once moue him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
me, nor haue compassion on me: So that he tooke and tyed
mée faste vnto a trée in the same Woodde, and suffered mée to
bée there faste, and woulde not vnbynde mée, but lefte me there
crying, wayling, and lamenting most pittifully: and there did
I so remaine all the whole night,<note place="margin">A tyrannous parte.</note> faste bound vnto the foresayd
trée, where I thinke I shoulde haue dyed through colde and for
wante of foode, if (throughe the goodnesse of almightie GOD,)
one had not come the nexte morning and loosed mée, that hearde
my pitifull lamentation, mourning, and crying. At which time
when I was vnbounde, I was neither able to goe nor stande:
and then the man that vnloosed mée, séeing mée in that pittyfull
case (being bothe a godlie and a mercyfull manne) hée didde
leade me home to my mothers house,<note place="margin">A godly man.</note> by little and little as wel
as he could. And for that hée perceyued my moother to be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
poore Woman, he did then giue my moother mony to relieue
hir self and mée withall. Doest thou knowe the man, saide the
Iudge, that thus did loose thée and leade thée home vnto thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Yea that I doe, sayde shée, and also where he doth dwell.
<pb facs="tcp:10199:79"/>
Then the Iudge saide vnto the poore woman, I will fence for
the man that thus hath myssused thy daughter, and also for him
that did vnbinde thy daughter and brought hir home, whereby
they shal apere before me at my next sitting in the open Court:
and in the meane space both you shall haue meate, drinke, and
lodging in my house. And then the pore woman and hir daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
humbly gaue him thankes.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>This was a godly Iudge in déede, he respected and
regarded, that there was and is a generall Iudge in Heauen,
that will bée mercifull to all godlie and righteous Iudges on
Earth, and that wil so iudge the cruel vnrighteous affectionate
and corrupte Iudges, that they shall goe to the euerlasting pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Hell, where they shall remaine in endelesse tormentes,
without any fauour or mercie (vnlesse they repent in time:) but
what followed I pray you? did the Iudge sende for them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>You néede not doubte that: whiche men when they
came before the Iudge, neither of them knewe wherefore hée
sente for them, at whiche time the sayde poore woman and hir
daughter were priuily placed not farre off. And then the Iudge
sayde to the Riche man, that had myssused the poore womans
daughter: I pray you tell mée where you were such a day and
about such an houre of the same day. Whereat the Riche man
being something amased, saide nothing: You do well, sayde the
Iudge, to take good aduisement, for you know it is better (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in this place) to speake the truth leysurely, than to tel a lie
rashly, why doe you not speake, sayde the Iudge? Forsooth my
Lorde, sayde the Rich man, I can not well tell, I haue almost
forgotten. Then sayde the Iudge, if I had asked you where you
were a tweluemoneth or halfe a yeare since, then you might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
forgette than remember it, but séeing this is so lately, not
past thrée or foure dayes since, it séemeth that eyther your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie
is verie euill, or else that the matter which you then did
goe about was not very good, nor in any respecte commendable.
But I am of this opinion, that if you had bin robbed of youre
goods, or your body wel beaten, a quarter or half a yeare since,
you woulde haue remembred the day and the verye time of the
<pb facs="tcp:10199:79"/>
day of the doing therof: therfore plucke vp your wittes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
your selfe well, but take héede you lye not: my Lorde,
said he, I wil not lye as nie as I can. And after that he had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised
himselfe a little, he said, my Lord I do not remember but
that I was at home all that day: then the Iudge saide, I muste
haue a flat aunswere, whether it be so or no: therfore if you saye
it certainely I am aunswered. And when the Riche man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
that there was no remedie, but that he must certify the
Iudge, where he was at that time, he said, (thinking that none
could or would witnesse the contrary) my Lord, I am sure y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I
was at home al that day, and neither road nor went fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> home.
Wel, said the Iudge I am aunswered, and then he was carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of the Courte vntil the Iudge called for him. Then the
Iudge commaunded one to go for the rich mans seruants, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
were but two in all, and to bring them before him, whyche
was quickly done. And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Iudge asked one of them whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his maister was at home all that day or not, for it is tolde
me that thy maister did beate a poore man at his doore, suche a
day, and suche an houre, for asking almes: forsooth my Lorde,
saide his seruant, he was at home all that day, vntil a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
night, but at that time he was not at home, therefore they
that say so, do belie my maister, how knowest thou that said the
Iudge? I knowe it saide he, by a very good token, for within a
quarter of an houre after my maister was gone, a friend of my
maisters came purposely to speake with him: whom I aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my master was newly gone forth, requiring him then to
stay a little, for that I thought he woulde not long be absente,
who tarried there a long houre at the least, and then he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
without speaking with him: howe long was thy maister
forth, saide the Iudge: Truly my Lord, saide he, two houres at
the leaste, then saide the Iudge, is here all thou canst say? yea
my Lord sayde he: what sayst thou, saide the Iudge to his other
seruaunt, which was a woman, was thy maister at home such
a day all the whole day or not? truely saide she, I am certayne
he was not at home al the whole day. How knowst thou y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>? said
the Iudge, forsooth my Lorde said she, he came into the Kitchin
<pb facs="tcp:10199:80"/>
that euening something late, and brought some drie stickes in
his hande, &amp; bad me rost meate therwith: to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I said, here is
good dry wood, where got you it? marry, said he, I had it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> gathered it in my groue, but she had bin as good, to haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
wood a mile off: and here is all that I can tell your Lorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of my maisters being from home that daye, therefore it is
a false lye my Lorde, that my maister did beate any at his dore,
for asking of almes, especially at that time, for I am most sure
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> home. And as it appeareth by his own saying,
he was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or about y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time, in a groue of wood of his own. wel,
said the Iudge, you haue done like true and good seruants, your
witnessing of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> truth wil make your maister anoyde much tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
but wil you take your othes, saide the Iudge, that thys is
true? yea saide they with all our heartes. And then the Iudge
deposed them, and caused theyr examinations to bée writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>Then the Iudge verye politickely vsed the matter,
to make them willing, and to drawe them on to tell the
truth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>He did so. And then the two seruants and witnesses
were commaunded aside, and not to come vntil they were sent
for. At which time the Iudge commaunded the Rich man to be
brought before him, and then caused him to stand among other
people that were there, and not in the open face of the Courte:
and then he sent for the Wench, that the Rich man had so wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly
handled: to whom, he said: maide, where were you such a
day, and at such an houre? forsooth my Lorde, said she, I was in
such a grone, gathering of stickes for to make a fire for my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and me. Art thou sure thou wast there the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? said the Iudge:
yea my Lord, saide she, I haue both a token to knowe it, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
cause to remember it, yea and that suche a one, as I shall neuer
forget as long as I liue: belike (saide the Iudge) the token was
either very good or very ill. Wel, séeing thou art sure, that then
thou wast there, I am satisfied, thinking verily y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou telst me
no lye. Then the Iudge called for the man, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> loosed the Wench
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the trée &amp; led hir home to hir mother, saying: I pray you my
<pb facs="tcp:10199:80"/>
friend where were you suche a morning, about such an houre?
my Lord, said he, about y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time as me as I can gesse, I was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards such a place, and as I was going I heard one gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
&amp; making pittiful mone, whervnto I gaue such eare, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by

hir, and so carried hir home to hir mother, for she was not able

the rather for that the groue is yours: Then said the rich man,
my Lord, thoughe the groue be mine, that proueth not, that I

faulte of hir selfe? Do you think that if one had tied hir to a trée
bicause shée would not suffer him to abuse hir, woulde shée ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
him, and saye shée was bounde to the trée for gathering of
stickes? Who wil think or once beléeue, that a stranger or one
that had nothing to doe therein, would therefore so handle hir?
So that reason doth fully resolue mée, that none woulde so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
vse hir, but onely the owner of the Wood. And nowe,
for that you are the owner of the Wood, it is impossible that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other should so cruelly handle hir for gathering of wood, but
onely you that are the owner thereof. O my Lorde, sayde the
Rich man, she doth this, I thinke, of spight: Canst thou make
mée beléeue, saide the Iudge, that she caused hir selfe to bée tyed
to a trée all a colde frostie night, which was ynough to kill hir,
onely to spight thée withall, or to bring thee to trouble? Shée
might haue found means to haue troubled thée with more ease
to hir selfe. But for as much as she complaineth that she was
tyed to a trée, and this man confesseth that he founde hir tyed to
a trée, and that she plainely affirmeth that you tyed hir to a trée,
and that you are owner of the Groue where she was so bounde
to a trée: therfore it can not choose but that you are the same man
that tied hir to the trée. And for the better manifesting of the
matter, you are taken in a trippe with your owne tale, for you
affirmed to me, and that aduisedly, that all that day you kepte
your owne house and wente not abrode, which I am able to say
is a manifest lie, for which you are like to pay full dearely: for
thy man hath confessed and sworne to the contrary. O my Lord
saide he, my man mystaketh the day: then saide the Iudge, if he
purposely haue tolde a lie, then purposely he shall be punished
for telling a lie: but there is no reason why herein he should tel
a lie, for in this case he could gain nothing to tel a lie, but auoid
great danger by speaking of truth. But you perhaps (seing your
selfe in a snare) by telling a lie might shunne a mischief, and by
vttering a truth might be driuen to some danger. And now bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou doest stande so stiffely in such a shamefull cause, I
haue another of thine owne seruants suche a witnesse againste
thée, that thou wast not onely from home at that time, but also
<pb facs="tcp:10199:82"/>
that then thou broughtest drye stickes from thy saide Groue, to
whome thou confessedst, that thou tookest the same then from a
wench, saying: she had béene better to haue gotten stickes, or
wood a myle off: wherein thou toldest trueth, for hir gathering
of stickes there, had like to haue coste hir hir life. And when the
wicked rich man hearde the Iudge speake these words, as one
confounded, he fel on his knées, and desired the Iudge to be good
vnto him.</p>

spare, out of thy great abundaunce of wood (whiche thou canst
neuer spende all thy life) a handfull of stickes (that other waies
would rotte and do no good) to saue the pore member of Christ
from staruing? If thou were a pore traueller by the way, and
very drye, not able to buy thée anye drinke, and shouldest take
an Apple that were fallen from the trée, whereon there were

he had scant mony to help himselfe, nowe he had more than y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough

of his had a Farme or Holding, whose grounde lay so nye
him, that all his deuice was, which way to come by it, but hys
first drift was, to buy his neighbours interest therin if it might
be, but his neighbour by no meanes would sel it: which practise
when he saw would not performe his purpose, he wente to the
Abbot, to whom the same did belong, and desired to take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same
Farme in reuersion of him and the Couent: but then he coulde
not allure the Abbot thereto by anye meanes. Yet after he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very importunate, (not dashed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one denyall as one more
shamelesse than shamfaste) the Abbot saide, (being verie lothe
to let him haue it) though I would graunt it you, yet that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
vnlesse the Couente agrée thereto, whiche I beléeue you
shal hardly or neuer obtaine. Who seeing that he could not get
the Abbots good wil, he practised with the whole Couent: who
through his faire words, large proffers, and goodly prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, got
them to graunt him their good wils. So that at length throughe
his diligence, and the Couents procurementes, the Abbot was
also thereto allured. And when he had gotten a graunt thereof,
&amp; also the same confirmed vnder the Abbot and Couents Seale,
he was not a litle ioyful, thinking by one fraude or other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a while to hoyse the true meaning Tenant out of his Farm.
And after (watching to take him in a trip, as the Spyder doeth
to catch the silly Flye in hir web) he commeth to his neighbour
<pb facs="tcp:10199:84"/>
and sayde, sirra thou hast forfeited thy Lease, for thou haste cut

two trées, I haue not forfeited my Lease, for I haue done it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
to serue my necessarie turne withall, wherein my Lease
doth warrante me: and therefore I will neyther goe out

thou art so lustie, thou shalt find in striuing with me y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou

in a fume, who made a full accoumpte (by his power and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie)
within a while to make the poore vnlearned Farmer, bothe

               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>Yea that he did: and I beléeue you wil say that he had

               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>It may be so, and it is a very like thing: but how got

he out of his house for feare of arresting?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>Wel ynough, for he called his wife vp early in the
morning before day, willing hir to shut the dore after him, for
sayd he, I must go to aske counsel of one, that I hope wil helpe
me out of my trouble: &amp; therfore loke not for me again in haste,
for I cannot tel how long it wil be ere I come again, but I wil
make all the hast home y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I can And so he toke his leaue of hys
wife, &amp; went straight to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Court, where the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King did lye: &amp; he
being a homely ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> country, hauing a Bil on his shoulder,
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Porters asked him who he was, &amp; what he would haue: &amp; he
said to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wold speak w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the King: to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> porters
said, may no worse ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> serue you to speake withal but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King?
no, said he, my erra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is to him, &amp; with him wil I speak er I go:
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I perceiue, said y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Porter, there is no remedie but you wyll
néeds speak with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King: yea y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I wil, said he: to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he sayd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
what if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king wil not speak with you? tut, said the plaine
Farmer, I know he wil speak w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> me, if he knew I were here:
therfore I pray thée Porter said the Farmer, tel the King that
I would speak with him. And if thou wilte do so much for me,
whensoeuer thou co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mest into our Country, I wil help thée to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
spéech of such a Gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if thou stand in néed, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou maist
say, I haue quit one good turn for another. At whose words the
Porter began to smyle, saying: doe you thinke Father that the
King is as easie to be spoken withall, as one of your Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is? yea, why not, saide the Farmer, he is but a man, as another
man is: that is true saide thée Porter, yet thoughe he be but as
another man is, he is able to doe more than any other can doe:
I know that wel ynough, saide the Farmer, or else I wold not
haue come so far to speake with him as I haue done. Wel fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
said y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Porter. I wold I could help you to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spéech of him,
but I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not, for I am appointed to be one of his highnesse Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I must waite here vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my charge: but I am content
you shal goe into the Court, where I warrant you, right quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
you shall méete with one or other, that wyll helpe you to the
spéeche of hys Grace. I thanke you good Porter, said the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
And then hée wente further into the Courte, who within
<pb facs="tcp:10199:85"/>
a while after saw a Gentleman gorg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ously apparelled, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
straighte waye he went, saying: may I be so bolde to speake a
word with you maister king? but the Gentleman aunsweared
him by and by, father you mistake me, my name is not King:
I thinke so, saide the Farmer, but are you not our comely king
and chiefe of all our Land? no father said the Gentleman, that
is to high a dignitie for me, I am but one of his poore seruants:
say you so, saide the Farmer, you are a goodly man, he goes not
trimmer than you I trow: yes, saide the Gentleman, that hée
doth, and thou neuer sawest a goodlyer man in al thy life than
he is. Would you speake with the king? sayde the Gentleman:
yea that I would, sayd he, and if you wil bid him come &amp; speak
with me I wil giue you a good groate for your labour: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
smyling therat, said: I had rather bring you to the king
for nothing, than to bring the King to you for a groate. But fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
saide the Gentleman, séeing you are desirous to speake
with t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e King, if you wil folow me, I wil bring you to him: I
thanke you, saide the plaine Farmer. And then he followed the
Gentleman with the Bil on his back.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>I thinke he came sooner to the spéeche of the King
by hys playnnesse, than some that were a greate deale more
curious.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>Yea that I am sure he did, and then when the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
came nie to the Tennis Courte, where the King was
a playing, he bad the Farmer stay a little vntil he came backe
again from the King. And then the saide Gentleman wente to
the King and tolde him, that there was a verye homely Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of the Countrey was come to speake with his Grace, for
whom if his Grace would send, and that he would speake with
him, he would haue very great delight in him: to whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king
saide, bring him hither to me, and I wil stay my play, to talke
with him. And then the Gentleman we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the plain Farmer,
and willed him to goe with him, and he shoulde speake wyth
the King: that I wil sayd the Farmer, with a good will, and I
thanke you too. And so the Gentlemanne broughte him into the
Tennis Court, where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King was: which is our comely King
<pb facs="tcp:10199:85"/>
saide the Farmer? that same is he, saide the Gentleman,
and pointed him to the King, who then was in his shirte:
you mocke me, saide the Farmer, that man goeth in hys
shirte: and the King, I am sure, néede not goe in his shirt
for lacke of clothes. He doth it for his pleasure, sayde the
Gentleman, he hath better clothes if it please him to weare
them: but if thou wilte speake with hym, lo, there he is, go
to him. And then this plaine and homely Farmer appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
nigh vnto the King, with his Bil on his shoulder, and
saide: are you our comely King? to whome the King aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered:
howe comely I am, I know not, but that I am the
King of this realme I knowe: arte thou come to speake
with me? If you be our King, said he, I am come to speake
with your Maship, therefore I pray you mocke me not, for
I will not conclare my cause to none but to the King hys
owne selfe. Whose talke, when the King heard, he smiled,
and saide: be bolde to say vnto me what thou wilte, for I
am the King indéede: none but my selfe, I thinke, will bée
so bolde to take it vppon him. You may be the King, said
the Farmer, but this same manne that brought me to you,
is more like a King than you. But nowe sir, séeing you
are our Maister King indéed, I am come to aske your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell.
For I tell you truely, the Lawyers are so deare, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in our Countrey, that they wil haue a Noble almost
for nothing, and yet a man shall be no wiser when he is
gone from them, than when he came to them. And bicause
you are a King, I beléeue you are as well skild in the lawe
as the beste of them al: And bycause I muste néedes paye
money for Counsell, I hadde rather your Maship had my
money than an other. Wherfore I pray you, good Maister
King, let me knowe your vise. Wel Father, said the King,
I am but a sorie Lawyer. Yea sir, saide the Farmer, you
doe wel, to mispraise your selfe: but I like you neuer the
worse for that: for with vs it is séene, that the greatest crac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
are the slendrest Clearkes: but I will saye this vnto
you, (take it as you list) if you be not wel learned, the fault
<pb facs="tcp:10199:86"/>
is in your self, for my maister your father was as able to pay
for your schooling, as the best ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in all our parish. Thinkest
thou so sayd the King? I thinke thou doest but gesse: nay it
passeth gessing, sayed the Farmer or else sauing your reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
some haue told me more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> truth: then said the King
tel me thy mind, &amp; I wil not only giue thée the best councell
I can, but also do for thée what I am able. Then said y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
God saue your life good M. King, I sée well now that
one were better go to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head than to the féele, there are some
with vs, that haue not so much liuing as you by report, that
are so full of curmosity, that they make such poore plaine me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
as I abasht to go and speake to them, therfore I cunne you
thanke M. King, that you will so gently heare a poore man
your selfe. I pray thée good fellow said y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King, tel me wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thou wouldest haue my councell, then sayd the Farmer,
mary sir thus it is, there is a Lawyer with vs, that was not
worth a gray grote when he came first into our countrie, &amp;
he had such a thréede bare gowne that a lowse (I may say to
you) could scant take hold on it, but now he is so full of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
(through his craftie counselling) that he is able to buy
poore me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s Farmes ouer their heads, &amp; to make their leases
end before they be halfe done. Hath he done so by thée sayd
the King? yea and please your maship, sayed the Farmer
bicause I would not sel him the lease of my Farme, he hath
taken it in subuersion, &amp; I tell you it lieth so néere his nose,
that he troubleth me with woortes, that I dare not tarie at
home, for feare of resting, so that he maketh him selfe sure
to heaue me out of it either by hooke or crooke. Then said the
King, though he hath got it in reuersion, which thou callest
subuersion, yet thou must enioy thy yeres: you haue concla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it very truly said the Farmer, for euen so I should if he
were an honest man: then said y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King, doth he say thy lease
is not good, or that thou hast forfeted thy lease? In déede he
sayth that I haue forfeated my lease, bicause I haue caused
two trées to be cut downe, which I did only for mine owne
necessaties, for my barne and my cart. Therfore here is my
lease, &amp; if you can read it, tell me whether I haue forfeted it
<pb facs="tcp:10199:86"/>
or no, by cutting downe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same two trées, nay it is a good
fiste I tell you for one of my yongest boyes wrote it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>The King had good sport to heare the homely Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
talke, I dare say, but did the King stand al that while in
his shirte, and did he also reade his lease?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>Yea that he did, &amp; when the King had redde &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vsed
his lease, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Farmer said how likes your maship my
leasse? to whom the king answered, feare not, thy lease is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good: if thou had cut downe half a score trées for thy neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
about thy Farme, thy lease were not forfeted therby,
say you so, said y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Farmer, bicause you haue clarified y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of my lease so wel, you shal be my lawier an other time,
&amp; though it be but smal, yet take this as a fée for your paine, &amp;
therewith he tooke xij. pence out of his purse, &amp; would néedes
giue it to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King, &amp; when the King saw that so importunatly
he threaped it on him, he tooke it &amp; put it betwéene his shirt &amp;
his bare skin, which when the King felt, he said merily, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shrewe
thy knaues hart, thy monie is cold. Then said y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
seing your maship saith that my lease is good, vpon your
worde I dare venture to go to the law, but the Courtes are
costly, and the sutes there so long, that I am loth to haue my
matter tried in any of them, yet tel me said the King, in what
Court wouldst thou haue thy cause to be discust. I like the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>so
well said the Farmer, that I care not if I come in none of
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all. Therfore I pray you good master King, help that my
matter may be in suche a Courte, where I may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oone be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatcht
&amp; spend litle monie. Bicause thou art a good plaine fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
said the King, thou shalt haue thy matter tried in such a
Court, as thou desirest: but canst thou be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent said the King
that I shal be Iudge of thy cause? content said the Farmer?
yea with al my hart: if thou wilt follow my counsell, said the
King, thy matter shall cost thée no monie, and it shalbe ended
within this houre or two at the furthest: marrie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is euen it
that I looke for, but haue you any Lawiers in this spéedie
and easie Courte that you speake of: no sayde the King,
if there were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but thrée or foure suche Lawiers (sayde the
<pb facs="tcp:10199:87"/>
Farmer, as the Lawyer that trobleth me, my matter wold
not be ended thys two or thrée yeares. Wel, said the King,
for this matter, at this time I will be thy Iudge. I will,
that as soone as thou commest home, that the Lawyer that
thus doth trouble thée, shall not onely suffer thée quietly to
enioye thy Lease, during the terme thereof: but also shall
pay thée towards thy costs and charges, an hundred pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds.
I like this wel, saide the Farmer: but howe shall I come
by the money? I wil sende a Letter or a Bill to him, saide
the King, that he shal performe this my commaundement:
and also paye thée the same money. Tut, said the Farmer,
he cares for no Billes, I haue séene Gentlemen send Bils
vnto him, and he hathe regarded them no more, than I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
a Rushe. Then saide the King, he wil regarde my
letter more, I warrant thée. Then said the Farmer, what
if he doe not regarde your Maships letter, howe shall I do
then? Thou néedest not doubte, saide the King, but he wyl
performe my Letter as soone as he séeth it: but to make al
thinges the more sure, thou shalte haue an other writing
with thée, sealed with our Signet, whiche when hée séeth,
he wil not be long a performing it. If this that you saye,
wil make him to doe it, I will giue your Maships horsse a
nights grasse, when you come into oure Countrie, and hée
shal fare no worse than my wiues kine do fare. God a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie
for that, saide the king. Nay, said the Farmer, you shall
haue a mease of Creame for your own mouth besides that.
I perceiue Father, thou meanest to bestowe some coste on
me. Yea, saide the Farmer, you are not euery man. No,
saide the King, for if I were euerye man, then thou musie
giue euery mannes horse grasse for a night, whiche all the
grasse thou haste wil scantly performe. And thus the King
and he passed in pleasant talke, whiles the writings were a
making. And then the King sette his owne hande to the
Letter and Writing: and so they were sealed as is before
saide.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>The plaine Farmer had good lucke to happen on
<pb facs="tcp:10199:87"/>
such a Iudge, he might haue gone to al the Iudges of your
Countrie, and not haue spedde so wel.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>That is moste true. And then the King sayde,
Father, lo, take this my Letter, and deliuer it to the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer
that doth molest or trouble thée: and I charge thée, giue
him no time for thy hundreth pounds, but receiue it forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
vpon his sighte of the Letter: and if he refuse to obey
my Letter, (as I beléeue he wil not) then deliuer him this
Writing, sealed with my Signet, &amp; then I warrant thée,
he will forthwith performe all that therein is contained: for
if he doe not, I wil make that Countrie too hote for him.
Nowe God rewarde you, saide the Farmer, I might haue
gone further, and spedde worse. Then the King said, séeing
thou haste giuen me the first fées that euer I tooke, and the
laste that euer I wil take: nowe I wil giue thée the firste
rewarde that euer thou receiuedst of a King, and perhaps
the laste that euer thou shalte receiue of a King: whiche, if
thou be a good husbande, wil beare thy charges home: and
therewith the King gaue him money. Barlady Maister,
saide the Farmer, I hadde good lucke to come to you: if I
hadde tarryed at home, the Lawyer woulde perhaps haue
hadde me in prison ere this: but if he vse not me wel, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce
may haue him in prison ere it be long. Then saide
the King, farewell good Father, and if the Lawyer resiste
thée, let me knowe it with spéede: whereby I wil finde such
meanes, that he shal neuer trouble thée more. Now God
be with you, good Maister King, saide the Farmer. And
this I may wel saye, that you are the quickest dispatcher
of matters, and the least taker of Fées, of al the Iudges
that euer I knewe.</p>

               <p>It is no doubt but that the Farmer wente home

            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>Coulde you blame him? Would it not make one

besides the séeing of his enimie so sodainely to bée
<pb facs="tcp:10199:88"/>
vanquished? yes I warrant you. And then the Farmer with
his bill on his backe, went merily home, and he comming
home late in the night, he knockt at his doore, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly
his wife did let him in.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>But did not the Lawyer maruell where he was

            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>Yes forsoth did he, and being very merie for his
absence, he declared abrode that he was run away for feare,
but that case was suddenly altered, for the next Sundaie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the Farmer came to the Lawier being in the Churche,
and sayd, Sir you haue gone about long to trouble and vexe
me, and all to get my liuing from me, but nowe I hope the
matter is taken vp betwéene you and me: who hath taken
vp the matter sayde the Lawyer? if any haue done it, that is
more than I know, saide he: than said the Farmer, he that
hath done it, is thought to be a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ufficient man to end a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
matter than this. Then saide the Lawyer, who wilbe so
bold, to determine any matter of mine without my consent?
yes saide the Farmer, he that did it dare do it well inough:
though you take your selfe to be a iollie fellow in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
&amp; thinke you may bind Beares here, he is taken for as
iollie a fellow where he dwelleth, yea &amp; may bind buls there:
then said the Lawier, though he rule there yet he can not rule
here: then said y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Farmer you dare not tell him so: dare I not
said the Lawier, yes &amp; rather tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he should take vp any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of mine, I would go to the law with him: though you are
a Lawier, yet you make but a wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g match to go to the Law
with him said the Farmer, and therewith he tooke the Kings
letter out of his bosome, and saide, he that hath ordered the
matter betwéene vs, hath sent you a letter, reade it, and then
you shall sée who hath sent it. Then sayd the Lawier (when
he looked on it) I perceyue it commeth from the Kinges Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie,
I will reade it and that willingly, and when he had
redde the letter, he sayde, neyghbour you néeded not to haue
taken this paynes to make the King an arbitrator betwéene
vs, a worse man might haue serued well inough, you should
haue found me reasonable inough, without such cost or tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
<pb facs="tcp:10199:88"/>
to the King, if you had come and talkte with me your
selfe. Yea marie sayd the Farmer, if I had come vnto you,
I should haue found you so reasonable, that you would haue
taken nothing for reason but the yéelding of my liuing: you
that can be content without all Lawe and reason to trouble
me wrongfully, and to take my Farme vnrighteouslie,
woulde scante vse me reasonably. You know, sayde be, I
am sure, what our Kinge hath written vnto you? yea, said
the Lawier very well: then I truste sayde the Farmer you
will suffer me to occupie my Farme quietly: yea that I will
sayde the Lawier, for I will not disobey the Kinges com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
in any pointe: to whome the Farmer sayde,
then I truste you will paie me my hundreth pounde forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
that the King hath appointed by his letter. I will pay
you it neighbour sayde the Lawyer, but I praye you giue
me some respite for the payment thereof, for I haue not so
muche readie monie to gyue you: sette your harte at reste
sayde the Farmer, I will haue it by and by, I will giue you
no dayes, therefore tell me whether I shall haue it or not.
I praye you neighbour sayde the Lawier beare with me, for
I haue it not nowe readie for you. Yea but, sayde the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
if you might haue my Farme at the payment of that
monie, I knowe you woulde paye it quickly and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
an houre. Nowe seing you haue an hundreth pounde in
a readinesse to vndoe me withall, then I am sure you haue a
hundreth pounde (though not so willingly) to helpe me, or
to performe the Kinges pleasure withall. Therefore make
no more a doe, for I will haue it presently, and if you thinke
this letter of the Kinges owne hande, is not sufficient, here
is an other sealed with the Kinges priuie Signet, whiche
when the Lawier perceyued, though he made a fayre shewe
outwardly, it grieued him not a little inwardly, and then
he caused the money to be fetcht, and so paide the Farmer the
hundreth pound that was appointed by the King. And when
the Farmer had his money, he saide to the Lawier, maister
Lawyer, as you like this, trouble your poore neighbours
<pb facs="tcp:10199:89"/>
agayne. And then the Lawyer went forth of the Churche
very sorrowfully: And the Farmer and his neighbors we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
home very ioyfully.</p>

               <p>The Farmer happened on a verye good Iudge.
Your King was maruellously to be commended therin: he
helped the pore Farmer spéedily, he rewarded him liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and enriched him with his enimies substaunce politike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and made him enioy his right according to equitie, and
feared other from taking their neighbours liuings wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.
If he had not gone to the King, he should surely haue
béene wronged at home. Affabilitie in a Prince is a worthy
Uertue, whereby much goodnesse doth growe: for if youre
King hadde béene proude and disdainefull, and had bin gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to a stately looke, rather than to an affable countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
this pore Farmer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> durst neither haue gone to hym, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he himsfelf wold vouchsafe to speake with him: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
clean of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary disposition: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pore Farmer was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldned
to go to the King, &amp; the King was most willing to
talke with his pore subiect: both which were such occasions,
that the oppressed was reléeued, helped and succoured: and
the oppressor was from his mischeuous prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce restrained.</p>

euery daye (excepte certaine times) at a certaine houre in

sit openly at the gates of his Courte, onely to heare poore
complaints or other Sutes, whereby they shall not néede
to procure friends, to helpe them to the speach of the King,
neyther shall be driuen to stay long, either for redresse, or

King should commit a poore mans Bil, into the hands of some
that he appointeth therefore, to bring it vnto him and to putte
him in remembraunce therof, and the same that hath the poore

               <p>None dare doe so with vs for their liues: for then the

trust with the saide wryting (to auoyde that danger) may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the poore man to prison, that he should not complaine to the
King: whereby the poore man may be constrayned, for feare of
long punishment, to agrée with his oppressor for little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and so be neuer the better, but rather the worse for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playning

On a time when the King was sitting at the gates,<note place="margin">A tale worth the marking of a wicked Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer.</note> to
heare suters, and mens complaintes, a poore man came to the
King, and gaue hym a Bill or Supplication, and desired hys
Grace to looke on it: whiche the King verye gentlye receyued
of the poore manne. But for that, the King had then many mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to debate (not hauing sufficiente time, to loke on the poore
mans Supplication) he gaue the same Supplication to one of
hys Remembrancers, commaunding him to deliuer it vnto
<pb facs="tcp:10199:90"/>
hym that night, or the next day at the furthest. Which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Kings
Remembrancer did not, either for that he was his friende, or
had giuen him a reward, on whom the poore man complayned
in his Bill: or else bycause the poore man gaue him not some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
to remember him to the King. Whiche poore man came
diuerse and sundry times to the saide Remembrancer, but he
saide, that the King was not yet at leasure to looke on his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.
To whom the poore man saide, sir I haue little or no
money to spende, and moreouer, I muse that it is so long ere
the King loke on it, for he commaunded you, to deliuer it vnto
him the same night, or the next day at the furthest: what, saide
the Kings Remembrancer, muste the King reade it when it
pleaseth you? wel, said the poore man, I pray you deliuer me my
Supplication againe, and I wil trouble you therewith no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
for to morrow I wil giue it vnto the Kings Maiestie my
selfe. Then the Kings Remembrauncer (being verie angrye)
saide, thou shalt not haue it, I am put in trust, and it is my of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to deliuer it, therfore thou shalt tarrie the longer. Sir saide
the poore man, thoughe it be your office to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber the King of
poore mens sutes and complaintes: yet it is more than your<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

office, to kepe mens Bils and Supplications from the King,
that he shall not reade them. Then the Kings remembrancer
saide, dost thou tell me my dutie? I will teache thée howe thou
shalt controle thy Superiors: and therewyth he sent him to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
commanding him to be closely kept, that none but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> keper
of the prison should speake with him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila</speaker>
               <p>Indéede that was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> next way, to kéep the pore man
from his right, and the King from the truth: but how didde the
poore man then? for he coulde haue no bodie to tell the King of
his case.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>He did well ynough, for the King being of a good and
perfect remembrance, within two or thrée dayes after, sayd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his said Remembrancer: why doe you not deliuer me the
poore mans Bil or Supplication, that I gaue you to kepe such
a daye? forsooth, said he to the King, I haue lost it: yea saide the
King, you are good to be a poore mans Soliciter: why didde you
<pb facs="tcp:10199:90"/>
not tel me thereof before I did aske you? then sayde he, I was
afraide to tel your Maiestie of it, meaning to haue the poore ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to make another, before your Grace shoulde haue knowen it.
Then said the King, why got you not the poore man to doe so?
then he saide to the King, I did neuer sée him since. Then saide
the King, the absence of the poore man, and your loosing of his
Supplication comming both so iump togither, is not very wel
to be liked. Then saide the Kings Remembrancer, it is lyke
that he is agréede, with the partie that he complayned of; or else
I should haue he arde of him ere this. Then the King saide,<note place="margin">Politike words to make the Remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer not to suspect.</note> it
may be so, &amp; it is verie like, but if the felow come to you bring
him to me, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I may know the cause of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plainte. And soone
after the King changed his apparell, making himselfe like a
seruingman, and went out at a priuie Postornegate, and so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in the prisons, what prisoners were there, and so by tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
with many of them, did vnderstand of this poore man that
was kepte in close prison, and therevppon the King being like
a seruingman, desired the kéeper of the prison that he mighte
speake wyth him: naye, sayde the Iayler, you shall pardon
me: what apparell hathe he? sayde the King: and then
the kéeper tolde hym: whiche apparell the King remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
well, whereby he perceyued it was the same manne
he looked for. Then sayde the King, séeing you wyll not
lette me speake with him, tell me I praye you, at whose
sute or commaundemente doeth he lye here, that I maye be
suter to them for him? marrie saide the kéeper, as farre as I
knowe, one of the Kings Remembrancers sente him hither:
God a mercie, saide the King, and now séeing I cannot speake
with him, I pray thée be good vnto him, and I will goe aboute
to release him: and the King then departed from the prison.
And as soone as the King hadde conueyed himselfe priuilye
into the Courte, hée sente for the sayde poore manne,
that was then thus kepte so in close prison (vnknowne to the
Kings Remembrancer.) And when he came before the Kyng,
he tolde the King howe he was committed to prison, by the
<pb facs="tcp:10199:91"/>
Kings Remembrancer, and tolde him the occasion therof: yea,
sayde the King, if we shoulde committe poore mens causes to
suche Remembrancers,<note place="margin">A thing to be marked.</note> and not looke to them our selues, the
oppressors shoulde be remembred and the oppressed shoulde be
forgotten: and the defrauders shoulde be defended, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded
vtterlye impouerished. If we shoulde winke at suche
wrongs, &amp; suffer such officers, the poore wythin a while would
rather loose theyr right than sue for their owne. Then the King
bad the poore man kéepe himself close in the next Chamber, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
he were called for.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>If Kings, Princes, and Rulers should searche thus
narrowly, as your King doth, they should finde some y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they put
in trust in such cases, most deceiteful; whome they take to bée
faithful, and troublers and hinderers of poore suters, that are
appointed to ayde and helpe them. But did the King remember
his Remembrancer?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>Yea the King remembred him so, that the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer
did neuer forgette it as long as he liued. As soone as
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King had conueyed the poore man away, he sent for his saide
Remembrancer, &amp; saide to him: was the poore manne with you
yet, whose Supplication you shoulde haue deliuered me? I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
saw him since, saide the Remembrancer: do you not know,
saide the King, him aga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nst whom he complayned in his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication?
no truely, saide the Remembrancer. Then sayde the
King, it séemeth hereby that you neuer reade the poore mannes
Supplication: are not you a fit man to be in this office, and to
be a Rememberer for me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s sutes, &amp; a Solliciter in their causes?
Then saide the Remembrancer, if it like your Grace, I reade
it, but I haue forgot it: it liketh me wel, said the King, that you
did reade it, but it misliketh me that you haue forgotte it:
you shall from henceforth be called the Kings forgetter, not
the Kings Remembrancer. Then said the King, I feare leaste
he against whom he came to complaine, hathe hurte him, killed
him or caste him in prison. I thinke it is not so, saide the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrauncer,
for none I beléeue dare be so bolde to vse anye
in such sorte, specially that come to sue to your Maiestie. Then
<pb facs="tcp:10199:91"/>
saide the King, if it shoulde be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>knowne, as it would hardely be
hid, it would be more painful than profitable to them. But if
any shoulde presume to doe so, saide the King, what were they
worthie to haue? truly, said the Remembrancer, they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
in my iudgement, to be whipped. I pray you, said the King,
tel me one thing that I shall aske you, but lye not. Do you not
knowe where the pore man is, whose Supplication I deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto you? No verily, saide he, I maruel why your Grace
shoulde aske me the question: Bicause, saide the King, it may
be, &amp; is very like, that he did come to you to knowe an answere
from me therof: if he had done so, as he did not, said he again to
the King, that maketh not that I knowe where he is, or what
is become of him. Yet if he came to you, saide the King, he
might then tell you, that his aduersarie or oppressor hadde sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
him or agréed with him: which if you should tel me, I
shoulde be then satisfied, and thinke, that the man is safe and
gone home. Then the Remembrauncer saide, if I should now
tell you any suche thing, then I shoulde be contrary to my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
tale: for I tolde your Grace, that I neuer sawe him since,
as I haue not indéede. Then I perceiue, saide the King, you
knowe not where he is: No indeede doe I not, saide he. Now
indéede,<note place="margin">Marke the Kings wordes.</note> saide the King, I beléeue you, for he is not in prison,
where you thinke, but he is out of prison where you know not.
Then the King called for the pore fellowe, and bade him come
before him. And when he was come before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King
saide to his Remembrauncer. Doe you knowe this fellowe?
at whiche time he saide nothing. If you be so forgetfull, saide
the King, you are not méete to be a Remembrancer, especially
to a King: this fellowe is more méete to be a Remembrauncer
than you, for though you haue forgotten him, he (I thinke) doth
remember you. Yea, if it please your Grace, said the fellow, I
reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber him indéed, and know him too wel. It doth please me,
saide the King, that thou doest remember him: but it doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
me, that thou haste such a cause to remember hym. How
say you, said the King to the Remembrancer, can you not call
this fellowe yet to your remembrance? well, bycause you are
<pb facs="tcp:10199:92"/>
so obliuious, here I discharge you, and you shall be my Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brauncer
no more. Though you remember not, that this fellow
required his Supplication of you, yet I trust you haue not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
that you haue sent him to prison, where he should haue
lien stil, if I had not béene a better Remembrancer than you.
I muse who gaue you aucthoritie to caste pore Suters in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that come vnto vs to complaine of their wrongs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries:
thoughe you, for youre pleasure commaunded him into
prison, I hope you wil not be angry, that I, for my pleasure
haue commanded him out of prison. Then the Remembrancer
fel down vpon his knées before the King. To whom the King
saide:<note place="margin">Worthy words of a King.</note> Ah varlet, what heart hadst thou to imprison this poore
man, that before had great wrong, and to séeke his vtter vndo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that was almoste vndone? Howe durste thou presume to
shop hym vppe in prison to kéepe him from me, whose liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
was necessary to complaine vnto me? As long as Kings are
serued wyth suche, the wicked shall bée boldened to oppresse
the pore, and the poore will be afraide to sue for their owne.
If thou haste done thus to a poore man being a Subiecte, what
wouldest thou doe, if thou were a Soueraigne? You sayde to
this poore man, you woulde teache hym to controll his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors:
nowe I saye to you, that I will teach you to imprison
your Inferiors. Haste not thou obserued the wordes of Christ
well, whiche we with all our indeuour haue commaunded to
be kept? that is, <hi>Whatsoeuer yee woulde that men shoulde
do to you, euen the same doe you to them?</hi> Wouldest thou
be content to bée cast into prison, for suing for thy right, as thou
haste done to this man for complayning for hys due? the doing
of that to him, that thou wouldest not haue him do to thée, she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth,
that thou arte no true Christian, but a Sathanist. How
subtilly wentest thou aboute to cause me to credite thée, when
thou saidst, that none durste be so bolde to vse hym so, when
thou knewest that thy selfe haddest so vsed him? But whereas
thou saidst, that none durste be so bolde as to doe it, nowe it
appeareth, that thou haste done that that none durst be so bold
to do: which argueth, that thou arte the boldest of all other, to
<pb facs="tcp:10199:92"/>
imprison pore men wrongfully. But séeing you haue béene so
bolde, as to punish this poore man without a cause: then I trust
I may be so bolde, as to punish you with a cause. And firste, for
that you sayd, they were worthy to be whipped that should vse
him so: according to your owne iudgement, my iudgement is,
that you shall be whipped naked. And bicause thou haste lyed
thrée seueral times to me: therefore thou shalte not speake anye
worde of nine moneths, that is, for euerye lye thrée moneths,<note place="margin">A wise iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King of <hi>Mauq<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sun.</hi>

be kepte likewise in close prison, seauen yeares, (that is, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery

during thy life, thou shalte weare on thy backe &amp; bosome, these

thée, vpon paine of death, that thou shalt not come at any time

departed, &amp; al his iudgements were executed &amp; performed. And

               <p>We néede haue no lawe nor order for suche, for there

               <speaker>Siuqila</speaker>
               <p>Yea that we haue, and that no small number: and if

               <p>What vncharitable men are their Creditors, that
wil suffer them to lye there, being not able to pay them? by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abroad, they might in time be able to pay them, either part
or al: but by lying in prison, they bring them to pouertie, their
wiues to penurie, and their children to miserie. Suche cruell
hearted caitiffes belike meane not to haue Christe merciful vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them at the laste daye, but make an accompte to be pinned
vppe or imprisoned in the dungeon of Hel for euer. For surely,
they that will not forgiue their pore brethren their smal debts,
whiche they maye be able to paye: Christe will not forgyue
them their greate and wonderfull debtes, that they are neuer
able to pay.</p>

               <p>There are some so cruell and so vengeable wyth
vs, that they had rather without any thing lette their pore deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors

all that he had in the worlde, wheresoeuer they coulde
finde it or haue it, to release him out of prison: desiring to haue
no more lefte him but the very shirt on his backe,<note place="margin">Most cruel Creditors.</note> to couer his

woulde not take this offer, but kepte hym in prison stil.</p>

               <p>Our Gentlemen, rich men and Merchant men with

in prison, but they among them will paye his debtes. There
was one with vs did owe vnto an other fiue hundred poundes:
and he, to whome he did owe al that mony, did lose all his goods
by mischaunce:<note place="margin">A rare relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of a priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in <hi>Mauqsun</hi>
                  </note> whiche fiue hundred pounds was all that the
creditor had to liue on, besides he didde owe parte of the same,
whereby he was constrained (thoughe very loath) to arrest his
debtor, thereby to sée if his saide debtor coulde make any frien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des

the partie was arrested, it was noysed abroade, that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
certaine charitable riche menne payde the fiue hundreth
poundes he oughte, to him that imprisoned him: and also they
gaue him one hundred pounds more to helpe him withall. And
so within two dayes after he was arrested, all his debts were
paide, he set at libertie, and had a hundreth pounds home with
him besides. Doe they vse the pore prisoners thus with you?</p>

an hundreth poundes a yeare. He hadde an Office besides that

               <p>No, he vsed him a little better than so, as you shall

within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Euening: and through his knocking one of his Sons
seruauntes came to the doore, which when he hadde opened, he
asked the olde man what he woulde haue, and with whom he
woulde speake: who aunswered againe, I woulde very gladlye
speak with your master, my master, said he, is now at Supper,
therefore he is not at leasure to speake with you. I praye you
tell him (saide the olde man,) that here is a poore man come to
speake with him from hys father, and then I thinke he wil ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

sayde, sir there is a poore olde man at the doore, that wold faine
speake with you, he saith he is come from your father: bid hym

whom as soone as his sonne sawe, he knewe him, wherewith
he rose out of his chaire, and knéeled downe, and asked his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
blessing: wherat his father coulde not refraine from wée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping:
then saide he, father I beseche you wéepe not but reioyce,
with me your only sonne, the sighte of you reioyceth me more
than any treasure on the Earth. I thoughte sonne, saide he, you
would not haue knowne me in this coate: we ought, saide hys

am so poore that I am not able to helpe my selfe, and then he
tolde him what mischaunce he had. Wel father saide his sonne
be patient,<note place="margin">Few sons wil aske such boonds of their fathers.</note> and thanke God for al: but where you say, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you are
so poore that you are not able to helpe your selfe: that I truste
will proue shortly not to be so. With that his Son fell vppon
his knées, and desired his father to graunte him one thing that
he woulde require at his hande. Alas sonne saide his father I
am not able to graunt you any thing, father sayde hys sonne,
that that I woulde aske of you you are easilye able to graunte,
therefore I will not leaue knéeling vnto you, vntill you haue
graunted me my petition. Then saide his father, rise vp
sonne, and knéele no more, for I will graunte it you, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you saye I maye easilye doe it. Then saide his sonne, from
thys time forwarde I giue you fréelye all my goodes and
Landes, that I haue in the Worlde, and that you shal possesse
and enioy them for your own, and that it shall be at your choice
to giue and to bestowe them where you liste. Which when his
father heard, he was astonied. Sonne saide he, that is too much
for me, a small portion thereof shall serue my turne: father said
his sonne, I trust you will not go from your grant, thus it must
be, it shal be none other. Well son, séeing there is no remedie,
I will take it vpon me, but if I had thoughte that this woulde
haue bin your request, I woulde not haue graunted to perform
it. Then his sonne made freshe and fine clothes to be putte on
hym, and a faire Gowne vpon his backe, and did place him in
his chayre at the vpper ende of the Table, saying, oh father
howe doe I reioyce to sée you maister of this house, you said eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

diuerse Prentises, whereof especially two of them, were not
only diligent and obedient, whilest they dwelt with him, but
waxed very riche after they began to trade for themselues. It
chaunced after, that their saide maister (through great losses on
the Sea, and through euill creditors) was maruellously decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and brought to greate pouertie, who escaping the Sea very
hardly, came home, and thinking then to giue ouer and to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
no more with suche Worldlye affaires (not shewing out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
the bare case he was in) sodainely solde all that he had,
and paide all his debts therewith, which being paide, there was
nothing remayned for him to liue on: &amp; he solde his house also to
pay his debts withal, wherin he had not past a moneths respite
to dwel: whose bare case these two seruaunts that were so riche
vnderstoode wel ynough, whereof one of them went in a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
vnto him and saide thus: sir, I vnderstande that you are
in more want than you make shew of, I haue learned that you
haue like a good man paide al your debtes, notwithstanding the
great losses you haue had of late, whereby you haue left youre
selfe little or nothing to liue on. Besides that, you haue solde
your house you dwell in. And séeing it is so, I am readie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe
halfe the goods I haue on you, which I hope is so much,
as will make you occupie freshly againe. You were my good
maister and brought me vp, in this rich trade that I nowe doe
vse, wheras if you hadde not shewed me, learned me, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
helped me, I coulde not haue gayned this I haue gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Besids that, you of your goodnesse gaue me an hundreth pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
to beginne withall, whiche in the meane season, to helpe you
in your néede, loe I haue brought you. To whom his mayster
saide, I thanke you for your good will, but I will neyther take
halfe your goods, whiche moste curteously you haue offered me,
neither the hundreth pounde that you now proffer me. For the
truth is so, I am fully bente and determined, (from whiche I
will not be perswaded) to giue my selfe to prayer and a quiet
liuing, so that I wil not from henceforthe trouble my self with
anye Worldly trade. Then, sir saide he, bycause you are thus
<pb facs="tcp:10199:97"/>
bent, I wil perswade you no more to the contrarie, but séeing
you haue refused my firste offer, I moste hartilye desire you to
take my seconde proffer, whiche is, as long as you liue to
take your bourding, lodging, &amp; finding in my house: and of this
one thing I assure you, you shall fare no worse than my selfe,
nor lye no worse than my selfe. Then saide the decayed Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntman,
God wil blesse and prosper such as you, that haue
such care of your maisters that brought you vp: I thanke you
for your gentle offer, it may be that I wil take it, but as yet I
wil not certenly promise you. Seing you wil not, sayd his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,

my Lorde, saide they bothe, and we will take him for oure

the breath is in our bodies: wel said the Iudge, I perceiue you

you thinke he will be contente to be with one of you? yea my

loth to promise eyther of vs, bicause he thinketh thereby to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
one of vs. Then saide the Iudge, it were best that he wer
here himselfe, and so he did sende one for him, who by and by
came vnto the Iudge: howe saye you, saide the Iudge, here are
two whiche were once your seruauntes, that are very desirous
to giue you your kéeping, and other necessaries as long as you
liue, whereof I thinke you are not ignoraunte. No my Lorde
saide the decayed Merchant, they both I thanke them haue bin

saide he,<note place="margin">A straunge kind of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> that I shal rule the matter? yea my Lorde sayde

a quicke dispatche of this matter. But my Lord, said y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe,
I beséech you heare me first, what I can saye for my selfe:
say on, saide the Iudge: I muste confesse, saide he, that we were
both his seruaunts, but I was the first that offered him this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
whiche my maister can not denye. I muste néedes confesse
that said his maister, then saide the Iudge, how long was it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that you hearde of his decaye, that you offred him this? for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth
my Lorde, saide he, the nexte day after. Then saide the
Iudge to the Defendant, howe long was it after ere you offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him this gentlenesse? within two houres after at the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest
said he. Then saide the Iudge to the Plantiffe, though he
came after you, yet he made more spéede than you: then saide
the Defendante, my Lorde, I beséeche you consyder, that
I was my Maysters seruaunte before he was: yea my Lorde
saide the Plaintiffe, but I was his seruaunte longer than he
was, &amp; also I think my maister did more for me, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for him,
for he gaue me a .C. <abbr>l.</abbr> at my first setting vp, for my self, therfore
<pb facs="tcp:10199:99"/>
I am more bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to do for him tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he: Yea but said y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Defenda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
my good Maister was bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for me, for 500. <abbr>l.</abbr> in wares, which I
borrowd at my beginning, &amp; gaue me also. 100. Marks in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
which was my chief making: &amp; therfore he did more for me
than he didde for you, wherefore I am more bounde to doe for
him. Then saide the Plaintiffe, I haue offered to finde him as
long as he liueth, and to fare, goe, nor lye, no worse than my
selfe: so haue I done, saide the Defendant, and I wil kéep him
as well as you for your life. Besides that (my Lorde) I haue
offered to giue him wéekly half a Crowne as long as he liueth,
to put in his purse, to spend or vse as he listeth. Then sayd the
Plaintiffe, I wil giue him a Crown to put in his purse wéekly
as long as hée liueth, and let him do withal what hée list. I wil
giue him a Noble, sayd the Defendant, rather than I will lose
the company of my Maister for mony. No more, said the Iudge:
do you offer this of spight that you haue one to the other? or for
zeale and good will you beare to your Maister? Then saide the
Plaintiffe, I owe this man the Defendant no euill will in al
the worlde: but I offer this to my good Maister, of pure zeale
and loue to my Maister. And I, said the Defendant, doe owe
this man that hathe caused me here to appeare, no manner of
mallice: but this that I haue proffered to my Maister, is onely
of Christian charitie and pure loue to my Maister. Well, saide
the Iudge, for that this your louing Maister is very willing to
be with one of you, and bothe of you are willing to haue him.
I will knitte vppe the matter in briefe. But firste tel me, how
farre dothe one of you dwell from another? Forsooth, said they,
we dwell wythin foure or fiue houses one of an other. Is there
neuer a preatie house betwéene you, that is emptye or to lette?
Yes, my Lorde, saide the Plainetiffe, a fréend of mine hath one
almoste betwéene vs both. To whome the Iudge saide: wyll
he not let it, thinke you? Yes I am sure, saide he, to whome I
liste. Then I doe awarde, saide the Iudge,<note place="margin">Marke this Iudgement.</note> that both you shal
hire the same for him to dwell in, and shall pay the rent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
equally, and you shall furnishe hys house with all thinges

hope, that woulde quickly release me, if they knewe of it. Wel,
saide the one of them, if your friendes were here, they shoulde
not néede to trouble themselues aboute the deliuering of you,
for I will pay youre debt, and release you out of prison: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
tel me his name, said he, and where he dwelleth, to whom
you owe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mony, for I wil not dine before I haue paid him thy
debt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he may release thée. No, said the other, you shall not pay
his debt, for I wil pay it for him: you shal not, said the other, for
I was within the prison doore before you. And thus they were
at contention one with an other, whiche of them should release
the pore man out of prison. And when the prisoner had told the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
where his creditor dwelled: then he that was firste within the
prison dore, was going to the creditor to agrée with him, and to
paye him the prisoners debte: which when the other sawe, he
would néedes go with him also, saying, that he woulde release
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prisoner. And for that he is my friend, said he, I knowe at my
<pb facs="tcp:10199:101"/>
desire he will take my money before yours. Yea, said the other,
I wil haue a remedy for that, &amp; he séeing an Officer there at the
prison dore, said, I pray thée arrest this man at my sute for such
matter as I haue againste him: and that he maye appeare this
day in the afternoone before the Iudge. And when he had giuen
him his fée, he departed thence, and then the Officer arreasted
hym by and by, and tolde him it was at the sute of such a one.
Wel, saide he that was arrested, I wil putte in sureties for my
appearance: and so he did.</p>

met him, who saide then vnto the Iudge: my Lorde, it was
my chaunce this day to goe to a prison, where I found but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one prisoner, who lyeth there for twentie pounds debt, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
prisoner I woulde haue released, and paide his saide debte
to hys creditor, but this man whome I haue caused to appéere
before you, woulde not suffer me, for when I was going vnto
him that imprisoned the pore manne, he saide he woulde goe to
him, and discharge the prisoner, wherein me thought he offered
me great wrong, to take that charitable worke out of my hand
that I was determined to do.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>But sauing your tale: me thinke, that he hadde no
lawfull cause to arreast him in this case.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>You thinke so: but it is as lawefull with vs to sue a
man for preuenting him of a charitable déede, as it is lawful for
a man to arrest one with you for preuenting him of any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commodity. And when he had told his tale before the Iudge:
then the Iudge asked the Defendant, whether he came oute of
his house, purposely to release a prisoner, or not? and he sayde,
yea. Did you so too, saide the Iudge to the Plaintife? Yea, my
Lorde, saide he, that was the onelye cause why I wente from,
home. Then the Iudge said to the Defendant, was this Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe
within the prison gates before you? My Lorde, saide he, I
muste néedes confesse that: but I followed hym immediately.
<pb facs="tcp:10199:101"/>
Then the Iudge called them to him one after an other, and
examined the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> priuely, at what time they were first minded,
to go visit the prison, thereby to release a prisoner: &amp; he that
was first in the prison said, that the night before, he was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
determined to do so the next morning as soone as he was
risen: the other being defendant said, that when he was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
deuising what he were best to do, he thought he could not
go about a better worke than to visite the prisoners, and to
helpe to release such as were there, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were not able to release
themselues. Then said the Iudge, you are both charitable &amp;
godly men, you striue to do well, where as many striue to do
euil. But for asmuch as you are both willing, to shew a great
déede of charitie of the poore prisoner, and that one of you wil
néedes paie his said debte of twentie pound:<note place="margin">Note this Iudgement.</note> my Iudgement
is, that you that are the plainetife, partly for that you were
first within the prison doore, but chiefly for that you were
first determined to visite the prison, to do suche a charitable
worke, that you shall paie the said twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie pounds to his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditour,
thereby to release him out of pryson. And further, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you that are Defendant, were so desirous to paie the
same for him, and to release him: therefore I decrée that you
shall giue the said poore man, when he is released out of pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie pounds also, to helpe to maintaine &amp; succour him
withall, for that I vnderstand he hath nothing to liue on: for
it is as charitable a déede, to relieue poore men (that can not
tell how to liue) when they be out of prison, as to helpe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease
them out of prison. For many are driuen to liue more
hardly out of prison, than in prison. With which iudgement,
these two charitable men did greatly reioice, and were mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelously
well contented, and therewith the Iudge arose and
departed.</p>

               <p>If you had not tolde me this tale, I would haue

your lawes so profitable, your Iudges so iuste, &amp;
your stories so straunge that I can not almost be wearie to
heare them. Their are many olde men in our Countrie, but
<pb facs="tcp:10199:102"/>
I beléeue the oldest of them all did neuer heare of any
suche fute before a Iudge, and that more, I thinke they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
shall. But whereas they striue thus with you, who
shall soonest release poore menne out of prison, there are
many with vs that contend, who shal kéepe them longest
in prison.</p>
               <p>At the last day when Christ the generall releaser of all
prysoners, shall sende the mercifull to heauen, and the
vnmercifull and the harde harted cut throtes, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fire, from whiche none shalbe able to release them: then
they will be sory that they kepte their poore brethren in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
For if Christe will sende the vnrepentant to Hell,
that doe not visite the poore: prisoners that are impryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by other: it is not like he will sende them to Heauen
that throwe their poore brethren in prison, and moste cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly
kéepe them there, suffering them to hunger starue,

Then one of the other Gentlewomen sayde, you shall not

               <p>Perhaps that would haue bene a meane to make

children were the fewest that any of them had. The next day
(bicause they woulde not prolong time) the other two seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
by processe, summoned this Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlewoman that had the
childe, to appeare before the Iudge the next day after: who
appeared accordingly, against whome they had put in their
billes of complaint, wherein eche declared for themselues as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
as they could. Whose billes when the Iudge had well
perused, he said, surely this our Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie of <hi>Mauqsun</hi> hath such
sutes in the Lawe, as I thinke no Countrie hath besides: I
pray you Gentlewomen saide he, do you sue this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
of spite and disdaine that she kéepeth the childe from
you, or of a Christian and charitable loue that you haue to
do such a godly déede? Truely, saide the one of them, I do it
onely of Christian charitie: and the other said, I do it of pure
loue that I owe to the poore member of my maister Christ.
We do it not for want of children, for we both haue good store
<pb facs="tcp:10199:103"/>
of children of our owne. And so haue I also, said she that had
the childe, wherfore my desire is, only to kéepe it for the loue
that I owe to God, and for the zeale I owe vnto the poore
friendlesse childe. Well, saide the Iudge, I perceyue you
claime <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he pore childe by your first comming to it, and by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it into your possession, which is a good point for you to
pleade by, séeing neither of them before had any title in the
childe. My Lorde, saide shée,<note place="margin">Such cases are not common.</note> I hope it will rather helpe
than hinder me: for the trueth is, I was so earnestly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
to haue the child, that I did run with all the indeuor I
coulce, whereby it was my good happe first to take holde of
it, and so I tooke it, and since I haue kepte it. It appeareth,
saide the Iudge, that you were desirous of it, or else you
woulde not haue runne with such a good will:<note place="margin">Marke the wordes of the Iudge.</note> and then the
Iudge saide to one of the other Gentlewomen, you claime
to haue title in the childe, for that you were the firste of the
thrée that beganne to runne towardes the childe: it sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
that you were desirous to haue the childe, or else you
woulde not haue preassed to haue runne firste of al towards
it: But for that this Gentlewoman was behinde you, and
then did out runne you, being muche grosser than either of
you, whereby she was the more vnable to runne, whiche in
euery mans iudgement, shoulde rather haue made hir come
behinde, thoughe she had béene before, than to come before,
being behinde: therefore I must néedes gather, though you
were very desirous to haue the childe, yet she was most ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
to haue it, for that she toke the moste paine therein, in
that she did out tunne you both, whereas there was greate
oddes that both you should haue out<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> runne hir. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
you (saide the Iudge to the thirde Gentlewoman) doe
claime the childe by firste seing of it, that maketh more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainste
you than with you: for you had such aduantage by
firste séeing of it, that thereby you mighte haue bene a good
waye before either of them: and for that you are moste slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the thrée, and therefore more apte to runne, you muste
néedes haue bene firste of all at the childe, if your desire to
<pb facs="tcp:10199:104"/>
haue it, had bene as carnest as your pretence is great, for
you running before they knew, must néedes be at the childe
before they coulde. And moreouer your comming lagge or
behind them both, your séeing it first, and sle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der making co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
sheweth manifestly, that you ranne rather for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie,
than for the child, or to get you good credit by ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning,
which you might haue lost by tarying. These are reasuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
coniectures, yet there may be priuy impediments that I
know not of. Wherefore Gentlewomen, as I feare I can
not please you all, so I woulde be loth to displease any of
you. I trust none of you would haue me to deuide the child
among you, as the harlot that was not the right mother,
would haue had King Salomon to do: for your desire is, to
haue it to preserue aliue, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked harlot for spite wold
haue had it killed. Yea my Lord said they, we desire to haue,
it nourished not spoiled, &amp; fostered not famished. Then sayd
the Iudge, coulde you find no body nye it, I muse howe it
came there: my Lord sayd she that had the child, this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
early I sent two of my men to search the fieldes, &amp; not
farre from the place where we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
where a poore woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was dead, but of what disease I know
not, she was not killed, for there was neither wounded nor
stroke to be found on hir, which poore woman was the very
mother of this child that I haue, for they tried that, not only
at the next towne, but also that she had two young children
more, which woman was a widdow. So that those her two
children haue neuer a father to releue them. Where are the
two children said the Iudge? forsooth, sayd the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
they be in that towne, my men know where they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e,
for they did sée them: what became of the dead woman said
the Iudge? the men of the same towne where she dwelled
caused hir to be brought thither, and finding that she dyed
of Gods visitation, they buried her. Well sayd the Iudge,
God hath so wrought, that where perhaps I shoulde haue
displeased some of you, nowe I hope I shall please you all:
therefore this is my Iudgement: you Gentlewoman that
<pb facs="tcp:10199:104"/>
tooke such paynes in running, whereby you first tooke holde
of the Childe, shal haue the same Child to kéepe, accordyng
to your desire, which I trust you will bring vp, as you will
do your own. And for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> both you so fain wold haue had the
Child, you shal haue the other two Children betwéen you,
that is, either of you one: And thus you thrée rich widowes,
shall kéepe thrée Childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of one poore widow. New lay you,
saide the Iudge, are you pleased herewith? yea my Lorde
said they, and we reioyce at your wise and godly iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t:

Bookes.</p>

               <p>Yes mayne giftes beside Bookes, procure and
deserue rewardes, and friendshippe with vs, but Bookes
are the chiefest of all other: for they are suche Scholemay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
as do teache all Sciences and knowledge espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie
to rype and pregnante wittes, without any wages
or rewards:</p>

               <p>What meante you to name Bookes thrice on a

               <p>Marie I will tell you: they that inuent and sette
forth diuine bookes to perswade men from sinne, to allure
them to godlinesse, to traine them to truth, to winne them
to obedience, and to leade them to the endlesse life: they I
say, that giue such giftes, making their giftes them selues,
haue of all other with vs, the most frendship &amp; the greatest
rewardes therefore. And they that deuise and frame bookes,
that teach good gouernment, politike orders, and common
commodities for a common wealth: such with vs as giue
such giftes of their owne making, finde great frendship and
the next rewardes to the other. And they that inuent and
make bookes, that teach honest trades, that explaine lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
sciences, and that open at large necessarie knowledge,
such as present any such giftes of their owne inuention, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
next fauour and frendship to the other, besides sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
rewardes correspondent to the gift.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>Those gifts that procure the most frendship, and
the greatest rewardes with you, I beleue obteyne the least
frendship, and the least rewardes with vs: and those that
are most estéemed &amp; gratified with vs, are least regarded &amp;
rewarded with you. But how are such bookes estéemed of
you after they be published?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>Maruelously, they reade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> throughly, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use
them aduisedly, and they practise them diligently: doe
they not so with you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>Some do so I am sure, but the most do not so I
am certaine.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>Do not many buy bookes with you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>Yes truly that they do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>Then it is no doubt, but that they do reade those
bookes they buy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, nor euery one readeth not the bookes that
are giuen them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>If they do not read them thorowly, to what ende
doe they buy them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>Many are so fantasticall with vs, that they buy
<pb facs="tcp:10199:105"/>
them for the newnesse of the Booke, not for the goodnesse of the
worke. For some, if they haue not a Booke, be it neuer so good
almost, before any other sée it, or haue it, he refuseth to reade it,
and maketh no accompte of it: tushe, saieth he, that Booke is
stale, as thoughe no Booke is good but while it is newe. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
a greate forte with vs, seldome or neuer reade Bookes tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
and aduisedly, vnlesse they be in such places, that almost
they can haue no other exercise, as suche as are in prison, way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in the Courte and other places, and suche as trauel on the
water, where many heare and reade that in good Bookes, that
otherwise they shoulde neuer reade nor heare.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>Truely, they are not of my mind, if I should buy a
Booke, I would surely reade y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Booke. As one cannot wel iudge
of a Booke before he reade it, so we ought to reade it throughly
before we iudge it. And as some haue a better opinion in an
vnread Booke, than it doth deserue: so some vnread Bookes do
deserue a better opinion, than many haue in them. Therfore
it is good to reade Bookes, for if an euil man reade a good booke,
he may be the better: and if a good man reade an euil Booke, he
will not be the worse. But we are sure of one thing with vs, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
Bookes cannot infect vs, for we haue not an euill Booke in
all our countrie.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>And if some might haue theyr willes, they woulde
not suffer a godly Booke in all our Countrey. Well sir, if you
were as much tyred with talking, as I am hungrie with hark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
you woulde tarrye no longer to aunsweare me: but now
for that I haue no more to aske you, but am satisfied in al thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
as my heart doth desire: therefore I will trouble you no
more: Assuring you, that for godly lawes, politike orders,
righteous Rulers, merciful Magistrates, iust Iudges, louing
Lawyers, pitifull Phisitions, zealous Husbandes, obedient
Wiues, dutifull Children, trustie Seruants, good Landlords,
honest Tenauntes, curteous Gentlemen, vertuous Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women,
charitable Neyghboures, and faithful Subieds, your
Countrey of <hi>Mauqsun</hi> excéedeth all the Countreys in the
Worlde. You haue ledde them such a daunce, that in al things
<pb facs="tcp:10199:106"/>
I am sure they wil not follow you in haste.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>I would you were as sure that they would follow vs
in goodnesse, as I am sure, we wil not folow them in euilnesse:
though I am in doubt that few wil practise our doings, yet I
beleue that you wil declare to many our deings.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>Be sure of that, I may trauell where I liste, and go
where I wil, but sure I am that I shall neuer come into anye
Countrey, where al things are in suche order as they are with
you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Omen.</speaker>
               <p>Many a Countrey may be godly gouerned, politike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ordered, with good lawes furnished, and with obedient sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
inhabited, and yet far vnlike ours in al points. Wel, they
may follow vs if they wil, but they shal not go before vs if they
would.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Siuqila.</speaker>
               <p>If they ment to follow you, as I feare they doe not,
they would come so far behinde, that I am out of doubte they
shoulde neuer ouertake you. Though my iorney home, will be
something grieuous vnto me, yet the knowledge of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
orders of your countrey, maketh me very ioyful: but there
is no remedie, if I intende to come home, I must set forwards
and begin to go home. Therefore nowe I wil take my leaue of
you, most humbly thanking you, for the paines you haue taken
for the vnfolding vnto me your maruellous orders, and youre
most Christian conditions.</p>

               <p>I woulde your long iorney were no more painefull
to you, than the discourse, of our Countrey hath bene trouble to
me. The God of al goodnesse guide you in your trauel.</p>

               <p>I doubt not but he wil: for he wil defende them from
dangers that trust truely to him. In whom is all my trust, and
in Iesus Christe, whose Kingdome God grant we may all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herite.
