            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SERMON I. The Consideration of our latter End.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSALM XC. 12.</bibl>
               <q>So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS <hi>Psalm</hi> is upon seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral peculiar accompts ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remarkable; for its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, in which it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps doth not yeild to any parcel of Scripture; for the eminency of its Authour, <hi>Moses</hi> the Man of God; the greatest of the ancient Prophets (most in favour, and (as it were)
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57527:4"/>
most intimate with God:) 'Tis also remarkable for the form and matter thereof, both affording much usefull instruction. In it we have a great Prince, the Governour of a numerous People sequestring his Mind from the management of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs to private Meditations; from beholding the present outward appearances, to considering the real nature and secret causes of things; In the midst of all the Splendour and Pomp of all the stir and tumult about him he observes the frailty of humane condition, he discerns the Providence of God justly ordering all; this he does not onely in way of wise consideration, but of serious devotion, moulding his observations into pious acknowledgments, and earnest Prayers to God; thus while he casts one eye upon Earth view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the occurrences there, lifting <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the other to Heaven; there seeing God's all governing Hand, thence seeking his gracious Favour and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. Thus doth here that great and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57527:4"/>
good Man teach us all, (more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly men of high Estate, and much Business) to find opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of withdrawing their thoughts from those things, which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amuse them (the Cares, the Glories, the Pleasures of this World) and fixing them upon matters more improvable to devotion; the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitoriness of their Condition, and their subjection to God's just Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; joining also to these Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations sutable acts of Religion, due acknowledgments to God and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Prayers. This was his practice among the greatest encumbrances that any Man could have; and it should also be ours. Of those his devotions, addressed to God, the Words are part, which I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen for the subject of my meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and present discourse; concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the meaning of which I shall first touch somewhat; then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound that observable in them, which I design to insist upon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:57527:5"/>
The Prophet <hi>David</hi> hath in the 39th <hi>Psalm</hi> a Prayer very near in words, and of kin (it seems) in sonse to this here; <hi>Lord,</hi> prays he, <note place="margin">Psa. 39. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Make me to know my end, and the measure of my days, what it is, that I may know how frail I am:</hi> Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the drift of which place, as well as of this here, it were obvious to conceive, that both these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets do request of God, that he would discover to them the definite term of their life (which by his decree he had fixed, or however by his universal prescience he did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern; concerning which we have these words in <hi>Job, Seeing mais</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Job 14. 5.</note> 
               <hi>days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds, that he cannot pass)</hi> we might, I say, at first hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be apt to imagine, that their Prayer unto God is, (for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of their mind burthened with afflictions, or for their better dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the management of their remaining time of life) that God
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57527:5"/>
would reveal unto them the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate length of their life. But this sense, which the Words seem so naturally to hold forth is by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Fathers rejected; for that the knowledge of our lives determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate measure is not a fit matter of Prayer to God; that being a secret reserved by God to himself, which to inquire into savours of presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous curiosity; the universal vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of which reason I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; but shall defer so much to their judgment, as to suppose that the numbring of our days (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their sense) doth here onely imply a confused indefinite compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our days number, or the length of our life; such as, upon which it may appear, that necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our life cannot be long (not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the accompt mentioned in this <hi>Psalm</hi> (the same with that of <hi>Solon,</hi> in <hi>Herodotus)</hi> above se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty or eighty Years, especially as to purposes of health, strength, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent) will probably by reason of

This I shall allow to be the <hi>Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick</hi> that <hi>Moses</hi> here desires to learn; whence it doth follow that teaching (or making to know, so it is in the <hi>Hebrew)</hi> doth import here (as it doth other-where frequently in Scripture) God's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording the Grace to <note place="margin">

This
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57527:6"/>
Interpretation I chuse, being in it self plausible enough, and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced by so good authority; yet the former might well enough (by good consequence, if not so imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately) serve my design: Or be a ground able to support the discourse I intend to build upon the Words; the subject whereof briefly will be this, that the consideration of our lives certain and necessary brevity and frailty, is a mean proper and apt to dispose us toward the wise conduct of our remaining life; to which purpose such a consideration seems alike available, as the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of its punctual or definite mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; or more than it; upon the same, or greater reasons.</p>
            <p>As for the latter clause, <hi>that we may apply our hearts to wisdom;</hi> 'tis according to the <hi>Hebrew, And we shall bring the heart to wisdom;</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, the application of our hearts to wisdom to be consequent upon the skill and practice (bestowed by God) of thus computing our days.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57527:7"/>
As for <hi>wisdom,</hi> that may denote ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>sapience,</hi> a habit of knowing what is true; or prudence, a dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of chusing what is good; we may here understand both, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the latter; for, as <hi>Tully</hi> saith of <note place="margin">

II.</hi> p. 95.</note> Philosophy, <hi>Omnis summa Philosophioe ad beate vivendum refertur,</hi> The summ or whole of Philosophy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to living happily; so all Divine Wisdom doth respect good practice.

I.</hi> p. 326.</note> (for so commonly such words are wont by way of <hi>metonymie</hi> to denote, together with the things primarily signified, all that naturally flow from or that usually are conjoined with them) in brief (to cease from more explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, which is in it self conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous enough) I so understand the Text, as if the Prophet had thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed himself: Since, O Lord, all things are in thy hand, and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign disposal; since it appears that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57527:7"/>
Man's life is so short and frail, so vexatious and miserable, so expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the just effects of thy displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; we humbly beseech thee, so to instruct us by thy Wisdom, so to dispose us by thy grace; that we may effectually know; that we may seriously consider the brevity and uncertainty of our lives durance; whence we may be induced to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, regard, and chuse those things which good reason dictates best for us; which according to true Wisdom, it most concerns us to know and perform. From which sense of the words we might infer many usefull documents, and draw matter of much wholsome discourse; but passing over all the rest, I shall onely insist upon that one point, which I before intimated, <hi>viz.</hi> that the serious consideration of the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and frailty of our life is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per instrument conducible to the bringing our hearts to Wisdom, to the making us to discern, attend unto, embrace and prosecute such
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57527:8"/>
things as are truly best for us; that it is available to the prudent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and management of our life; the truth of which proposition is grounded upon the divine Prophet his opinion: he apprehended such a knowledge or consideration to be a profitable means of inducing his heart to Wisdom; wherefore he prays God to grant it him in order to that end; supposing that effect would proceed from this cause. And that it is so in way of reasonable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence I shall endeavour to shew by some following reasons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The serious consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration <note place="margin">1 John 1. 17. <hi>Love not the world;</hi> for <hi>—the world pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth away, and the desire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi>
               </note> of our lifes frailty and shortness will confer to our right valuation (or esteem) of things, and consequently to our well-placing, and our duly moderating our cares, affections and endeavours about them. For as we value things, so are we used to affect them, to spend our thoughts upon them, to be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57527:8"/>
in pursuance or avoiding of them. There be two sorts of things we converse about, good and bad; the former, according to the degree of their appearance so to us (that is, according to our estimation of them) we naturally love, delight in, desire and pursue; the other likewise in proportion to our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning them, we do more or less loath and shun. Our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons therefore being all thus directed and grounded, to esteem things aright both in <note place="margin">

Now among qualities that commend or vilifie things unto us, duration and certainty have a chief place; they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57527:9"/>
often alone suffice to render things valuable or contemptible. Why is Gold more precious than Glass or Crystal? why prefer we a Ruby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Rose, or a Gilly-flower? 'tis not because those are more service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, more beautifull, more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to our senses than these (it is plainly otherwise) but because these are brittle and fading, those solid and permanent; these we cannot hope to retain the use or pleasure of long; those we may promise our selves to enjoy so long as we please; whence on the other side is it, that we lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fear or shun any thing how pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, how offensive so-ever, being assured of its soon passing over, the biting of a flea, or the prick in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting bloud? The reason is evident; and that in general nothing can on either hand be considerable (either to value or disesteem) which is of a short continuance. Upon this ground therefore let us tax the things concerning us whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or bad, relating to this
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57527:9"/>
life, or to our future state; and first the good things relating to this life; thence we shall be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to judge truly concerning them, what their just price is, how much of affection, care and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour they deserve to have expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on them.

to the mind of Man. And so therefore we may justly conclude them to be; so finishing the first grand advantage this present consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration affordeth us in order to that wisedom, to which we should apply our hearts.</p>
            <p>I should proceed to gather other good fruits, which it is apt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and contribute to the same purpose; but since my thoughts have taken so large scope upon that former head, so that I have already too much, I fear, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised your patience, I shall onely mention the rest. As this consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration doth, as we have seen, First, dispose us rightly to value these temporal goods, and moderate our affections about them; so it doth, Secondly, in like manner, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the right estimation of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral evils; and thereby to the well tempering our passions, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment of them; to the beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of patience and contentedness in our minds. Also, Thirdly, it may
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57527:28"/>
help us to value, and excite us to regard those things (good or evil) which relate to our future state; being the things onely of a perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent nature, and of an everlasting consequence to us. Fourthly, It will engage us to husband carefully and well employ this short time of our present life: Not to defer or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crastinate our endeavours to live well; not to be lazy and loitering in the dispatch of our onely consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable business, relating to eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; to embrace all opportunities, and improve all means; and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the best <hi>compendiums</hi> of good practice leading to eternal bliss. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, It will be apt to confer much toward the begetting and preserving sincerity in our thoughts, words and actions; causing us to decline all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique designs upon present mean in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, or base regards to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or affections of men: bearing single respects to our conscience and duty in our actions; Teaching us to speak as we mean; and be what
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57527:28"/>
we would seem; to be in our hearts and in our closets, what we appear in our outward expressions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations with Men; For conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that within a very short time all the thoughts of our hearts shall be disclosed; and all the actions of our lives exposed to publick view (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing strictly to be examined at the great bar of divine judgment before Angels and Men) we cannot but perceive it to be the greatest folly in the World, for this short present time to disguise our selves; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal our intentions, or smother our actions. What hath occurred (upon these important subjects) to my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, I must at present, in regard to your patience, omit. I shall close all with that good <hi>Collect</hi> of our Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Almighty God, give us grace, that we may cast away the works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and put upon us the armour of light now in the time of this mortal life, in which thy Son Jesus Christ</hi>

            <p>IN discoursing formerly upon <note place="margin">
                  <p>Job 14. 14.</p> 
                  <p>All the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.</p>
               </note> these words (expounded accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the most common and passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble interpretation) that which I chiefly observed was this: That the serious consideration of the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and frailty of our life is a fit mean or rational instrument subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the bringing our hearts to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57527:30"/>
wisedom; that is, to the making us discern, attend unto, embrace and prosecute such things as, according to the dictates of right reason, are truly best for us.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The truth of which observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I largely declared from hence, that the said consideration disposeth us to judge rightly about those goods (which ordinarily court and tempt us, <hi>viz.</hi> worldly glory and honour; riches, pleasure, knowledge; to which I might have added wit, strength and beauty) what their just worth and value is; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently to moderate our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, our cares, our endeavours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them; for that if all those goods be uncertain and transitory, there can be no great reason to prize them much, or to affect them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently, or to spend much care and pain about them.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I shall next in the same scales weigh our temporal evils; and say,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57527:30"/>
that also, The consideration of our lives brevity and frailty doth avail to the passing a true judgment of, and consequently to the governing our passions, and ordering our behaviour in respect to all those temporal evils, which either according to the Law of our nature, or the fortuitous course of things, or the particular dispensation of providence do befall us. Upon the declaration of which point I need not insist much, since what was before discoursed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the opposite goods doth plainly enough infer it; more immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indeed in regard to the <hi>mala damni,</hi> or <hi>privationis,</hi> (the evils, which consist onely in the want, or loss of temporal goods) but suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently also by a manifest parity of reason in respect to the <hi>mala sensus,</hi> the real pains, crosses and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, that assail us in this life. For if worldly glory do hence appear to be no more than a transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent blaze, a fading shew, a hollow sound, a piece of theatrical pagean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57527:31"/>
the want thereof cannot be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry considerable to us. Obscurity of condition (living in a valley be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath that dangerous height, and deceitfull lustre) cannot in reason be deemed a very sad or pitifull thing; which should displease, or discompose us; if we may thence learn that abundant wealth is rather a needless clog, or a perillous snare, than any great convenience to us; we cannot well esteem to be poor a great inselicity, or to undergo losses a grievous calamity; but rather a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to be free from the distractions that attend it; to have little to keep for others, little to care for our selves. If these present pleasures be discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hence to be onely wild fugitive dreams; out of which being soon roused we shall onely find bitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grets to abide; why should not the wanting opportunities of enjoying them be rather accompted a happy advantage, than any part of misery to us? If it seem, that the greatest persection of curious knowledge (of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57527:31"/>
what use or ornament soever) after it is hardly purchased, must soon be parted with; to be simple or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant will be no great matter of lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; as those will appear no solid goods, so these consequently must be onely <hi>umbroe malorum,</hi> phantasms, <note place="margin">Sen. <hi>Ep.</hi> 89.</note> or shadows of evil, rather than tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or substantially so; (evils created by fancy and subsisting thereby; which reason should, and time will surely remove.) That in being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient or disconsolate for them, we are but like children, that fret and wail for the want of petty toys. And for the more real or positive e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, such as violently assault nature, whole impressions no reason can so withstand, as to distinguish all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tast or afflictive sense of them; yet this consideration will aid to abate and asswage them; affording a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hope and prospect of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing redress. It is often seen at Sea, that Men (from unacquaintance with such agitations, or from brackish steams arising from the salt Water) are
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57527:32"/>
heartily sick, and discover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be so by apparently grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous symptoms; yet no man hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there doth mind or pity them, because the malady is not supposed dangerous, and within a while will probably of it self pass over; or that however, the remedy is not far off; the sight of Land, a tast of the fresh Air will relieve them: 'Tis near our Case: We passing over this troublesome Sea of life: from unexperience, joined with the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness of our constitution, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well endure the changes and crosses of fortune; to be tossed up and down; to suck in the sharp va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours of penury, disgrace, sickness, and the like, doth beget a qualm in our stomachs; make us nauseate all things, and appear sorely distemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet is not our condition so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, as it seems; we may grow har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, and wear out our sense of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; however, the Land is not far off, and by disembarking hence, we shall suddenly be discharged of

or dismay us; if we remember how short they are, we cannot esteem them so great, or so intolerable.

to beget in us the hope, to qualifie us for the reception of better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; such discourses indeed are of a better nature, and have a more excellent kind of efficacy: yet no fit help, no good art, no just wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon is to be quite neglected in the combat against our spiritual foes.

Baser re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies (by reason of the Patient's constitution, or circumstances) do sometime produce good effect, when others in their own nature more rich and potent want efficacy. And surely frequent reflexions upon our mortality, and living under the sense of our life's frailty cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce somewhat to the begetting in us an indifferency of mind toward all these temporal occurents: to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate both the goods and the evils we here meet with; consequently therefore to compose and calm our passions about them.</p>

III. But I proceed to another use of that consideration we speak of emergent from the former, but so as to improve it to higher purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. For since it is usefull to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minishing our admiration of these worldly things, to the withdrawing our affections from them, to the slackning our endeavours about them; it will follow that it must conduce also to beget an esteem, a desire, a prosecution of things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to our future welfare; both by removing the obstacles of doing so, and by engaging us to consider the importance of those things in comparison with these. By removing obstacles I say; for while our hearts are possessed with regard and passion toward these present things, there can be no room left in them for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and affection toward things future. 'Tis in our soul as in the rest of nature; there can be no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration of objects (as it were) in our hearts, nor any vacuity in them;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57527:35"/>
our mind no more than our body can be in several places, or tend se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways, or abide in perfect rest; yet some-where it will always be; some-whither it will always go; some-what it will ever be doing. If we <hi>have a treasure</hi> here (some-what <note place="margin">Matth. 6. 21.</note> we greatly like and much confide in) <hi>our hearts will be here</hi> with it; and if here, they cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; they will be taken up; they will rest satisfied; they will not care to seek farther. If we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <note place="margin">

               </note> worldly glory and delight in the applause of men, we shall not be so carefull to please God, and seek his favour. If we admire and repose confidence in riches, it will make us neglectfull of God, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strustfull of his Providence; if our <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 5.</note> mind thirsts after, and sucks in gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily sensual pleasures, we shall not relish spiritual delights, attending the practice of vertue and piety, or arising from good conscience; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to, attending upon Masters of so different, so opposite a quality

But when the heart is discharged and emptied of these things; when we begin to despise them as base and vain; to distast them as insipid and unsavoury; then naturally will succeed a desire after other things promising a more solid content; and desire will breed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour; and endeavour (further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God's assistence always ready to back it) will yeild such a glimps and taste of those things, as will so comfort and satisfie our minds, that thereby they will be drawn and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged into a more earnest prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. When (I say) dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on ambitious Projects, heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Being somewhat disentan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled from the care of our sarms and our trafficks; from yoaking our oxen and being married to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent delights; we may be at leisure, and in disposition to comply with divine invitations to entertainments spiritual. Experiencing, that our <note place="margin">Matth. 22. 5.</note> trade about these petty commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties turns to small accompt, and that in the end we shall be nothing rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thereby; reason will induce us

Thus will this consideration help toward the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57527:37"/>
us to inquire after and regard the things concerning our future state; and in the result will engage us to compare them with these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent things, as to our concernment in them and the consequence of them to our advantage or damage, whence a right judgment, and a congruous practice will naturally follow. There be four ways of comparing the things relating to this present life with those which respect our future state: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the goods of this with the goods of that; the evils of this with the evils of that; the goods of this with the evils of that; the evils of this with the goods of that. All these comparisons we may find often made in Scripture; in order to the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming our judgment about the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective value of both sorts; the present consideration intervening, as a standard to measure and try them by.</p>
            <p>First then; comparing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent goods with those which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our future state, since the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitoriness
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57527:38"/>
and uncertainty of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral goods detract from their worth, and render them in great degree con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible; but the durability and certainty of spiritual goods doth encrease their rate, and make them exceedingly valuable; 'tis evident hence, that spiritual goods are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely to be preferred in our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be more willingly embraced, to be more zealously pursued than temporal goods, that in case of competition, when both cannot be enjoyed, we are in reason obliged readily to part with all these, rather than to forfeit our title unto, or hazard our hope of those. Thus in the Scripture it is often discoursed: <hi>The world</hi> (saith St. <hi>John) passeth</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 John 2. 17.</note> 
               <hi>away, and the desire thereof; but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever:</hi> The World, and all that is desirable therein is transient; but obedience to God's commandments is of an everlasting consequence; whence he infers, that we should <hi>not love the world;</hi> that is, not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57527:38"/>
such an affection thereto, as may any way prejudice the love of God, or hinder the obedience spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thence, or suitable thereto.</p>

               <hi>and all the glory of man as the flower of the grass; the grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away; but the word of the Lord endureth for ever:</hi> All worldly glory is frail and fading, but the Word of God is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally firm and permanent; that is, the good things by God promised to them, who faithfully serve him, shall infallibly be conferred on them to their everlasting benefit; whence it follows, that as he exhorts, we are bound to gird up the loins of our mind, to be sober, and hope to <note place="margin">v. 13.</note> the end; to proceed and persist constantly in faithfull obedience to God. <hi>Charge those</hi> (saith St. <hi>Paul) who are rich in this world, that they</hi>

               <hi>is a commendable avarice;</hi> it being necessary for the accomplishment of any worthy enterprize; there being nothing excellent, that can soon or easily be effected. Surely he that hath much and great business to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch; and but a little time allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it, is concerned to husband it well; not to lose it wholly in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; not to trifle it away in unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary divertisements; not to put himself upon other impertinent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; above all not to create obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to himself, by pursuing matters of a tendency quite contrary to the success of his main undertakings. 'Tis our case; we are obliged here to negotiate in business of infinite price and consequence to us; no less than the salvation of our souls and eternal happiness; and we see, that our time to drive it on and bring it to a happy issue is very scant and short; short in it self; and very short

We are bound to furnish our minds with needfull knowledge of God's will and our duty; we are to bend our unwilling Wills to a ready compliance with them; we are to adorn our souls with dispositions suitable to the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

The spending much time about those things doth steal it from these; yea, doth more than so, by discomposing our minds so that we cannot well employ what time remains upon our spiritual concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

The Scripture aptly resembles our life to a way faring, a condition of travel and pilgrimage; now he that hath a long journey to make, and but a little time of day to pass it in, must in reason strive to set out soon, and then to make good speed must proceed on directly, making no stops or deflections (not calling in at every sign that invites

               <q>I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy Commandments.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS Psalm (no less excellent in vertue, than large in bulk) containeth manifold reflexions upon the nature, the properties, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts and effects of God's Law, many sprightly ejaculations about it (conceived in different forms of speech; some in way of petition,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57527:55"/>
some of thanksgiving, some of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, some of assertion or apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism) many usefull directions, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny zealous exhortations to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance of it; the which are not ranged in any strict order, but, (like a variety of fair flowers and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some herbs in a wild field) do with a gratefull confusion lie dispersed, as they freely did spring up in the heart, or were suggested by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout spirit of him, who indited the <hi>Psalm;</hi> whence no coherence of sentences being designed, we may consider any one of them absolutely or singly by it self.</p>
            <p>Among them, that which I have picked out for the subject of my discourse, implieth an excellent rule of practice, authorised by the <hi>Psalmist</hi>'s example; it is propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in way of devotion or immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate address to God; unto whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible knowledge his conscience maketh an appeal concerning his practice; not as boasting thereof, but as praising God for it, unto
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57527:55"/>
whose gratious instruction and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour he frequently doth ascribe all his performances: But the manner of propounding I shall not insist up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the rule it self is, that speedily, without any procrastination or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, we should apply our selves to the observance of God's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the practice of which rule it shall be my endeavour to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and press.</p>
            <p>It is a common practice of men, that are engaged in bad courses, which their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science discerneth and <note place="margin">

               </note> nature of God, and eternal reason of things; if God had not decreed, if he had not said these things, they would not assuredly be true; for it is a foul contradiction to reason, that a Man ever should please God without obeying him; 'tis a gross absurdity in nature, that a Man should be happy without being good; wherefore all the wit in the World cannot devise a way, all the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon Earth (yea, I dare say, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Heaven it self) cannot esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish a condition, beside faithfull ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57527:57"/>
of God's Law, that can save, or make us happy; from it there can be no valid dispensation, without it there can be no effectual absolution, for it there can be no acceptable commutation; nor in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thereof will any faith any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, any trick or pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever avail, or signifie any thing: Whatever expedient to supply its room superstition, mistake, craft, or presumption may recommend, we shall, relying thereon, be certainly deluded: If therefore we mean to be saved (and are we so wild as not to mean it?) if we do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce felicity (and do we not then renounce our wits?) to become ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, to proceed in a course of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, is a work that necessarily must be performed; and why then should we not instantly undertake it; wherefore do we demur or stick at it? how can we at all rest quiet, while an affair of so vast impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance lieth upon our hands, or until our mind be freed of all uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty

and suspence about it? Were a probable way suggested to us of acquiring great wealth, honour or pleasure, should we not quickly run about it, could we contentedly sleep, till we had brought the business to a sure or hopeless issue? and why with less expedition or urgency should we pursue the certain means of our present security and comfort, of our final salvation and happiness? in doing so, are we not strangely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with our selves?</p>

in sin, we live in enmity and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Almighty, who can at his Pleasure crush us; we lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a fatal plague, which, if we do not seasonably repent, will certainly destroy us; we incur the most dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of all hazards, abiding in the confines of death and destruction; God srowning at us, guilt holding us, Hell gaping for us: Every Sinner is (according to the <hi>Wise-man</hi>'s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression) <hi>as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth</hi>

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57527:70"/>
declarations and promises are infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly true, those instances peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily do evince, that repentance is never super-annuated; that if we can turn at all, we shall not turn too late, that <hi>poenitentia nunquam sera, modo seria,</hi> is an irrefragable rule; yet nevertheless delay is very unsafe; for what assurance can we have, that God hereafter will ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us to perform those conditions of bewailing our sins, and forsaking them? have we not cause rather to fear that he will chastise our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding his Grace? for although God faileth not to yield competent aids to Persons who have not <hi>despised his goodness and long-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:57527:71"/>
We might add, that supposing God in super-abundance of mercy might be presumed never to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his grace; yet seeing his grace doth not work by irresistible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion; seeing the worse qualified we are, the more apt we shall be to cross and defeat its operation; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we cannot hope that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after we shall be more fit than now to comply with it: Yea, seeing we may be sure, that after our hearts are hardned by perseverance in sin, we shall be more indisposed thereto; we by delay of repentance do not onely venture the forfeiture of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace, but the danger of abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it, which heinously will aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate our guilt, and hugely augment our punishment.</p>
            <p>We should do well therefore most seriously to regard the <hi>Apostle</hi>'s ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition; <hi>Exhort one another to day,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 13.</note>

            <p n="1">1. We may consider the causes of delay in this case (as in all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of moment) to be bad and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of a Man: What can they be but either stupidity, that we do

not apprehend the importance of the affair; or improvidence that we do not attend to the danger of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in sin; or negligence that we do not mind our concernments; or sloth that keepeth us from rowsing <note place="margin">

its vain Pomps and mischievous Pleasures; to be packing up their Goods, to be casting their Accompts, to be fitting themselves to abide in that state into which they are tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, to appear at that Bar, before which suddenly nature will set them. As a Ship, which hath long been tost and weather-beaten, which is shattered in its timber, and hath lost much of its rigging, should do nothing in that case but work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Port, there to find its safety and ease; so should a Man, who having past many storms and <note place="margin">

can do, and therefore we should at any time endeavour it; there are common reasons for all ages, there are special reasons for each age, which most strongly and most clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do urge it; it is most seasonable for young Men, it is most necessary for old Men, it is most adviseable for all Men <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>Again, be our condition what it will, this advice is reasonable: Are we in health? we owe God thanks for that excellent gift, and the best gratitude we can express is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving it for his service and our own good; we should not lose the advantage of a season so fit for our obedience and repentance; while the forces of our body and mind are entire, while we are not discomposed by pain or faintness, we should strive to dispatch this needfull work, for which infirmity may disable us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:57527:87"/>
Are we sick? it is then time to consider our frailty, and the best we can to obviate the worst consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof: It is then very fit, when we do feel the sad effects of sin, to endeavour the prevention of worse mischiefs that may follow; it is sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, when we lie under God's correcting hand to submit unto him, to deprecate his wrath, to seek re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with him by all kinds of obedience sutable to that state; with serious resolutions to amend hereafter, if it shall please God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store us; it is most adviseable, when we are in the borders of death to provide for that state, which lieth just beyond it.</p>
            <p>Are we rich and prosperous? 'tis expedient then presently to amend, lest our Wealth do soon corrupt us with Pride, with Luxury, with Sloth, with Stupidity; lest our Prosperity becometh an inevitable snare, an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverable <note place="margin">Prov. 1. 32.</note> bane unto us.</p>
            <p>Are we poor or afflicted? it is then also needfull to repent quickly;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57527:88"/>
that we may have a comfortable support for our soul, and a certain succour in our distress; that we may get a treasure to supply our want, a joy to drown our sorrow; a buoy to keep our hearts from sinking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to desperation and disconsolateness. This condition is a medicine, which God administreth for our soul's health; if it do not work presently so as to doe us good, it will prove both grievous and hurtfull to us.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Lastly, we may consider, that abating all the rufull consequences of abiding in sin, abstracting from the desperate hazards it exposeth us to in regard to the future life, it is most reasonable to abandon it, betaking our selves to a vertuous course of practice. For vertue in it self is far more eligible than vice, to keep <note place="margin">

What is vice but a sort of practice which debaseth and disparageth us, which plungeth us into grievous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, which bringeth distemper of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and soul, distress of fortune, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, trouble, reproach, regret, and numberless inconveniences upon us? which for no other reason, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it so hurteth and grieveth us, was by our loving Creatour interdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to us?

most pleasant, most credita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; vice is most sordid and base, ugly, hurtfull, bitter, disgracefull, in it self, and in its consequences. If we compare them together, we shall find, that vertue doth always preserve our health, but vice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly doth impair it; that vertue improveth our estate, vice wasteth it; that vertue adorneth our repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, vice blemisheth it; that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue strengthneth our parts, vice weakneth them; that vertue main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth our freedom, vice enslaveth us; that vertue keepeth our mind in order and peace, vice discompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth and disquieteth it; vertue breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth satisfaction and joy, vice spawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth displeasure and anguish of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: to enter therefore into a vertuous course of life, what is it but to embrace happiness; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in vitious practice, what is it but to stick in misery?</p>
            <p>By entring into good life, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the favour and friendship of God, engaging his infinite power and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57527:89"/>
wisedom for our protection, our suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, our direction and guidance; enjoying the sweet effluxes of his mercy and bounty; we therewith become friends to the holy Angels, and blessed Saints, to all good Men, being united in a holy and happy consortship of judgment, of charity, of hope, of devotion with them; we become friends to all the World, which we oblige by good wishes, and good deeds, and by the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of good example; we become friends to our selves, whom we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by enrich and adorn with the best goods; whom we gratifie and please with the choicest delights: but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in sin we continue to affront, wrong, and displease our Maker, to be disloyal toward our Sovereign Lord; to be ingratefull toward our chief Benefactour, to disoblige the best Friend we have, to provoke a most just and severe Judge; to cope with Omnipotency, to contradict Infallibility; to enrage the greatest Patience, to abuse immense Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57527:90"/>
We thereby become enemies to all the World, to God, whom we injure and dishonour; to the friends of God, whom we desert and oppose; to the creatures which we abuse to our pride, lust and vanity; to our neighbours, whom we corrupt, or seduce; to our selves, whom we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave of the best goods, and betray to the worst evils.</p>
            <p>Beginning to live soberly, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to live like Men, following the conduct of reason; beginning to live in charity, we commence the life of Angels, enjoying in our selves most sweet content, and procuring great benefit to others; but going on in sinfull voluptuousness, we proceed to live like beasts, wholly guided by sense, and swayed by appetite; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pertinacious in malice we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be like fiends, working tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in our selves, and mischief to our neighbours.</p>
            <p>Embracing vertue we become wise and sober Men, worthy and honourable, beneficial and usefull to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57527:90"/>
the World: but continuing in vice, we continue to be foolish and vain, to be vile and despicable, to be worthless and useless.</p>
            <p>By our delay to amend, what do we gain? what, but a little flashy and transient pleasure instead of a solid and durable peace; but a little counterfeit profit instead of real wealth; but a little smoak of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull opinion instead of unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable sound honour; shadows of imaginary goods instead of those which are most substantial and true, a good mind, the love of God, the assured welfare of our souls.
