         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>Of Consumptions.</head>
               <p>COnsumptions are Decays of the Radical Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
whereby the natural Heat of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
is so weakened, that it cannot make a
due Separation of Meats and Drinks received, which
causes from thence to arise abundance of bad Juices
or Phlegm; so that no good Nourishment can be bred,
let the Food be never so Rich<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor the Drink Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
which all People afflicted find by Experience.
But these Distempers proceed likewise from various
Causes. As,</p>
               <p>1. From over-charging Nature with too great
Quantities of Rich Food: or in Others, by drinking
much Brandy, Wine, and strong Drinks, which weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
the natural Heat, and destroys the Action of the
Stomach. In Others, and idle, sedentary Course of
Life, or want of proper Exercises; lying in bed too
long, too warm Cloathing, and too soft Feather
or Down Beds, which proves always prejudicial to
to the Health of all Persons. It is caused some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by too much frequenting the School of <hi>Venus,</hi>
provoking Nature beyond her Ability, and oft-times
corrupts her, in her very <hi>Radix.</hi> Young married People,
as well as the most lewd, are oft caught in this Snare,
and let this be a Caution. Others by excessive Heats
or Colds, Surfeits and the like Accidents: Some by Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
and long Fits of sickness; to some through Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly,
Grief, or Trouble of Mind, or Despair and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106407:3"/>
Envy. Some have Consumptions Hereditary, which
is the hardest of all to cure.</p>
               <p>Now when thou findest thy self indisposed, and
thy Stomach to grow weak, and a general Disorder
to run through thy whole Body, and that thy
Strength decays; consider what it was that caused
it, whether Temperance, or Intemperance in Meats
or Drinks, in respect of the Quantity or Quality, as
also their Exercises, and all other Extreams thou
hast inured thy self to: Consider further, what
Air thou hast lived in, where the Disease was bred,
and by this means thou mayest guess at the Cause of
thy Distemper. And when this is done, thou ought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
gradually to alter for the better, the whole Course
of thy Life; not in the nature and quality of the
Meats and Drinks only, but in their quantity; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
thy Exercises and the Air, as far as the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of thy Life will admit thereof: for change of
Food, Exercises, and Airs, work wonders. If withal,
you betake your selves to meer simple Meats and
Drinks that are easier of Concoction, and generate
a freer and firmer Substance.</p>
               <p>I shall now set down what Food, Drink and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
are agreeable to the Stomachs of sick and

               <p>Take what quantity of Milk you please, let it

off the Top of it, and eat it with well bak'd Bread;
neither toast your Bread, nor warm your Milk;
except the weather be cold, and then you may make
it blood warm, but then do not toast your Bread:
You may if you please, eat Bisket with your Milk,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106407:3"/>
but do not eat too great a quantity at once: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
you may mix a little Water with the Milk,
and sweeten it with good white Sugar: you may <unclear>eat</unclear>
this three times aday, if you make it your sole
Food. Continue this six or eight Months at least<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <head>To prepare Milk with Wheat-Flower, an Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Way.</head>
               <p>Take a quart of New Milk, after it has stood
five or six Hours from the time it was milk'd, put to
it a third part of River or Spring Water, set it on
a clear fire; then take some Wheat-Flower, and
temper it with either Water or Milk into a Batter,
and when the Milk is ready to boyl, put in your
Thickning, and stir it a while; and when it is ready
to boyl again, take it off; then put as much Salt
and Bread to it as you please, then let it cool with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

spoonfuls of Flower is enough for a quart of Milk
and Water, make it about the thickness of ordinary
Milk-pottage. This keeps your Body in excellent
Temper, neither binds nor loosens too much, and
it never tires nor clogs the Stomach.</p>

eat it with Ale, others with Cream, Milk, and

with Bread only. It removes Obstructions, strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens

               <p>The best sort for sick People, is that which
is made of Wheat-flower, but not too fine dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
for then it will be dry and husky; and your
Leaven'd Bread is much better than that made
with Yiest; you may make it after this manner.
Take what Flower you please, make a hole in
the middle of it, break then your Leaven in;
take as much blood-warm Water, as will wet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
half your Flower, mix the Flower and Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
well together, cover it with the remaining
Flower close; this do in the Evening, and by
Morning the whole will be well Leavened: then
add some more blood-warm water as is sufficient,
and knead it up very stiff and firm, the more
pains you take, the better: when you have so
done, let it lie warm by some fire, near two hours,
till the Oven is ready, then bake it, but let not the
Oven-mouth be close stopp'd, that the Air may
have more or less Egress or Regress. But the
best way is to make it into thin Cakes, and bake
them on a Stone, with a Wood-fire under. Of
Rye, Barley, Oats, you may make Cakes after
the same manner; put no Salt into your Bread.</p>

               <p>It is made thus: First they boil it as high as other
Sugars, then out of the Pans they take this Syrup,
and put it in an Earthen Pot; then they set it in a hot
Stowe, there to stand 9 or 10 days; in that time the
fierceness of the sulphureous heat coagulates it into
an hard tough substance, then you take it out from
the Syrup, and put the Candy or hard Lumps into
the Stowe again, but made about 2 or 3 degrees hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
where it must remain 9 or 10 days longer, and

from thin cloathing, as many imagine: for if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side

Inconveniencies. The best way to prevent out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Colds, and the Evils that happen through
thick and thin Cloathing, and by heats, sweatings,
and the like, is to change your Cloaths often. As
for Example: Put on when you stay at home in a
morning one sort of Cloaths, and when you go out,
put off your Cloaths to your Shirt, and put on fresh
and cold Cloaths, and again at night pull off them
to the Shirt, and put on the others. And for those
that sweat much by their labour, let them pull off
all their Cloaths, Shirt and all, and put on fresh
Shirts, and cold Cloathing; and for those that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travel
themselves, let them do the like; but observe
that both sit still a while, before they either eat or
drink.</p>
               <p>Observe farther by the bye, the Pruens, Figs,

               <p>A Man in the Countrey may Live Plentifully for
Two Pence a Day; for in many Countries you
may have Two quarts of milk for a Penny, to
which add a Pint of Water, and not half a penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth

Dish, sufficient for Four People, and this stands but in
Three-half-pence; eat some Bread with it, and there
is no Victuals affords better Nourishment, and that
to all Ages, but especially young people. The like
is to be understood of other Foods, where every
one observes his time of eating, and his weight
and measure of Food, and a great Trouble and
Waste will thereby be avoided. As to Quantity
of other Foods, we suppose that Sixteen Ounces,
solid Food, to wit, Bread, Cheese, Butter, and
Eggs, may be sufficient Twenty-four hours for a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
man, and the best time for eating, we
suppose to be about Eight in the Morning, and
Four in the Afternoon.</p>
               <p>If the Food be Flower'd-milk, then a Pint of
it, and four Ounces of Bread and Butter or Cheese,
is sufficient: If Water-Grewel or Pottage, a Pint
and four Ounces of Bread and Cheese: If Raw
milk, the same; but if Flower'd-milk with an
Egg in it, Three Ounces of Bread and Butter or
of Cheese, will be sufficient.</p>
