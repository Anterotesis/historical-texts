            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and Consistency is to
be found in most of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stems
of Divinity I have met

the Christian Religion. What

to the Father of Lights for his
Condescention to our Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings.
If upon a fair and

Gospel, I beseech thee, as a true
Christian, in the Spirit of the
Gospel (which is that of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity)

set me right in the

            <head>The Reasonableness of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
as delivered in
the Scriptures.</head>
            <p>TIS obvious to any one who
reads the New Testament,
that the Doctrine of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
and consequently of the Gospel,
is founded upon the Supposition of
<hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall. To understand therefore
what we are restored to by Jesus Christ,
we must consider what the Scripture
shews we lost by <hi>Adam.</hi> This I thought
worthy of a diligent and unbiassed
search: Since I found the two Extreams,
that Men run into on this Point, either
on the one hand shook the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of all Religion, or on the other
made Christianity almost nothing. For
whilst some Men would have all <hi>Adam</hi>'s
Posterity doomed to Eternal Infinite
Punishment for the Transgression of
<hi>Adam,</hi> whom Millions had never heard
of, and no one had authorized to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sact
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60354:4"/>
for him, or be his Representative;
this seemed to others so little consistent
with the Justice or Goodness of the
Great and Infinite God, that they
thought there was no Redemption
necessary, and consequently that there
was none, rather than admit of it upon
a Supposition so derogatory to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Attributes of that Infinite
Being; and so made Jesus Christ no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Restorer and Preacher of
pure Natural Religion; thereby doing
violence to the whole tenor of the New
Testament. And indeed both sides
will be suspected to have trespassed this
way, against the written Word of God,
by any one, who does but take it to
be a Collection of Writings designed
by God for the Instruction of the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate
bulk of Mankind in the way
to Salvation; and therefore generally
and in necessary points to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
in the plain direct meaning of
the words and phrases, such as they
may be supposed to have had in the
mouths of the Speakers, who used
them according to the Language of
that Time and Country wherein they
lived, without such learned, artificial,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60354:4"/>
and forced senses of them, as are sought
out, and put upon them in most of
the Systems of Divinity, according to
the Notions, that each one has been
bred up in.</p>
            <p>To one that thus unbiassed reads the
Scriptures, what <hi>Adam</hi> fell from, is
visible, was the state of perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
which is called <hi>Justice</hi> in the
New Testament, though the word
which in the Original signifies <hi>Justice,</hi>
be translated <hi>Righteousness:</hi> And by
this Fall he lost Paradise, wherein was
Tranquility and the Tree of Life, <hi>i. e.</hi>
he lost Bliss and Immortality. The Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
annexed to the breach of the Law,
with the Sentence pronounced by God
upon it, shew this. The Penalty stands
thus, <hi>Gen.</hi> II. 17. <hi>In the day that thou
eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</hi> How
was this executed? He did eat, but in
the day he did eat, he did not actually
die, but was turned out of Paradise
from the Tree of Life, and shut out
for ever from it, <hi>lest he should take
thereof and live for ever.</hi> This shews
that the state of Paradise was a state
of Immortality, of Life without end,
which he lost that very day that he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60354:5"/>
eat: His Life began from thence to
shorten, and wast, and to have an end;
and from thence to his actual Death,
was but like the time of a Prisoner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Sentence past and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,
which was in view and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
Death then enter'd and shewed
his Face, which before was shut out,
and not known. So St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> V.
12. <hi>By one man sin entred into the
world, and death by sin; i. e.</hi> a state of
Death and Mortality: And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XV.
22. <hi>In Adam all die; i. e.</hi> by reason
of his Transgression all Men are Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
and come to die.</p>
            <p>This is so clear in these cited places,
and so much the current of the New
Testament, that no body can deny,
but that the Doctrine of the Gospel is,
that Death came on all Men by <hi>Adam</hi>'s
sin; only they differ about the signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the word <hi>Death.</hi> For some
will have it to be a state of Guilt,
wherein not only he, but all his Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
was so involved, that every one
descended of him deserved endless tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in Hell-fire. I shall say nothing
more here how far, in the apprehensions
of Men, this consists with the Justice
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60354:5"/>
and Goodness of God, having men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
it above: But it seems a strange
way of understanding a Law, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
the plainest and directest words,
that by <hi>Death</hi> should be meant Eternal
Life in Misery. Could any one be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by a Law, that says, <hi>For Felony
you shall die,</hi> not that he should lose
his Life, but be kept alive in perpetual
exquisite Torments? And would any
one think himself fairly dealt with, that
was so used?</p>
            <p>To this they would have it be also
a state of necessary sinning, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
God in every Action that men
do: A yet harder sense of the word
<hi>Death</hi> than the other. God says, <hi>That in
the day that thou eatest of</hi> the forbidden
Fruit, <hi>thou shalt die; i. e.</hi> thou and thy
Posterity shall be ever after uncapable
of doing any thing, but what shall be
sinful and provoking to me, and shall
justly deserve my wrath and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Could a worthy man be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to put such terms upon the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of his Subjects, much less can
the Righteous God be supposed, as a
Punishment of one sin wherewith he
is displeased, to put Man under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60354:6"/>
of sinning continually, and so
multiplying the Provocation? The
reason of this strange Interpretation we
shall perhaps find in some mistaken
places of the New Testament. I must
confess by <hi>Death</hi> here I can understand
nothing but a ceasing to be, the losing
of all actions of Life and Sense. Such
a Death came on <hi>Adam,</hi> and all his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
by his first Disobedience in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,
under which <hi>Death</hi> they should
have lain for ever, had it not been for
the Redemption by Jesus Christ. If by
<hi>Death</hi> threatned to <hi>Adam</hi> were meant
the Corruption of Humane Nature in
his Posterity, 'tis strange that the New
Testament should not any where take
notice of it, and tell us, that Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
seized on all because of <hi>Adam</hi>'s
Transgression, as well as it tells us so
of <hi>Death.</hi> But as I remember every
ones sin is charged upon himself only.</p>
            <p>Another part of the Sentence was,
<hi>Cursed is the ground for thy sake; in
sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days
of thy life, in the sweat of thy face
shalt thou eat bread, till thou return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ground: For out of it wast thou
taken; Dust thou art, and to dust shalt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60354:6"/>
thou return.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. III. 17-19.</note> This shews that Paradise
was a place of Bliss as well as Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
without toyl, and without sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
But when Man was turned out,
he was exposed to the toyl, anxiety,
and frailties of this Mortal Life, which
should end in the <hi>Dust,</hi> out of which
he was made, and to which he should
return; and then have no more life or
sense than the <hi>Dust</hi> had, out of which
he was made.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Adam</hi> was turned out of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,</hi>
so all his Posterity were born out
of it, out of the reach of the Tree of
Life, All like their Father <hi>Adam</hi> in a
state of Mortality, void of the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility
and Bliss of <hi>Paradise.</hi> Rom. V.
12. <hi>By one man sin entered into the
world, and death by sin.</hi> But here will
occur the common Objection, that so
many stumble at: How doth in consist
with the Justice and Goodness of God,
that the Posterity of <hi>Adam</hi> should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for his sin; the Innocent be punished
for the Guilty? Very well, if keeping
one from what he has no right to be
called a <hi>Punishment.</hi> The state of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
in Paradise is not due to the
Posterity of <hi>Adam</hi> more than to any
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60354:7"/>
other Creature. Nay, if God afford
them a Temporary Mortal Life' 'tis his
Gift, they owe it to his Bounty, they
could not claim it as their Right, nor
does he injure them when he takes it
from them. Had he taken from Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any thing, that was their Right;
or did he put Men in a state of Misery
worse than not being without any fault
or demerit of their own; this indeed
would be hard to reconcile with the
Notion we have of Justice, and much
more with the Goodness and other At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
of the Supream Being, which
he has declared of himself, and Reason
as well as Revelation must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to be in him; unless we will
confound Good and Evil, God and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.
That such a state of extream ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remidiable
Torment is worse than no
Being at all, if every one ones sense
did not determine against the vain Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
and foolish Metaphysicks of
some Men; yet our Saviour's peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
decision, <hi>Matt.</hi> XXVI. 24. has
put it past doubt, that one may be in
such an estate, that it had been <hi>better
for him not to have been born.</hi> But
that such a temporary Life as we now
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60354:7"/>
have, with all its Frailties and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Miseries is better than no Being, is
evident by the high value we put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it our selves. And therefore though
<hi>all die in Adam,</hi> yet none are truly
<hi>punished</hi> but for their own deeds. <hi>Rom.</hi>
II. 6. <hi>God will render to every one, how?
according to his deeds. To those that
obey unrighteousness, indignation and
wrath, tribulation and anguish upon every
soul of man that doth evil,</hi> v. 9. 2 Cor.
V. 10. <hi>We must appear before the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-seat
of Christ, that every one may
receive the things done in his body, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that he has done, whether it
be good or bad.</hi> And Christ himself,
who knew for what he should condemn
Men at the last day, assures us in the
two places where he describes his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
at the great Judgment, that
the Sentence of Condemnation passes
only on the <hi>workers of Iniquity,</hi> such as
neglected to fulfil the Law in acts of
Charity, <hi>Mat.</hi> VII. 23. <hi>Luke</hi> XIII. 27.
<hi>Mat.</hi> XXV. 42. But here is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of any one, for what his
fore-father <hi>Adam</hi> had done, which 'tis
not likely should have been omitted,
if that should have been a cause, why
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60354:8"/>
any one was adjudged to the <hi>fire</hi> with
the <hi>Devil and his Angels.</hi> And he tells
his Disciples, that when he comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
with his Angels is the Glory of
his Father, <hi>that then he will render to
every one according to his works, Mat.</hi>
XVI. 27.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> being thus turned out of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,
and all his Posterity born out
of it, the consequence of it was, that
all men should die, and remain under
Death for ever, and so be utterly lost.</p>
            <p>From this estate of Death Jesus
Christ restores all mankind to Life;
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XV. 22. <hi>As in</hi> Adam <hi>all die, so
in Christ shall all be made alive.</hi> How
this shall be, the same Apostle tells us
in the foregoing <hi>v. 21. By man death
came, by man also came the Resurrection
from the dead.</hi> Whereby it appears,
that the Life, which Jesus Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stores
to all men, is that Life, which
they receive again at the Resurrection.
Then they recovered from Death, which
otherwise all mankind should have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
under lost for ever, as appears
by St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Arguing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XV. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Resurrection.</p>
            <p>And thus men are by the Second
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60354:8"/>
               <hi>Adam</hi> restored to Life again: That so by
<hi>Adam</hi>'s sin they may none of them lose
any thing, which by their own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
they might have a Title to. For
Righteousness, or an exact obedience to
the Law, seems by the Scripture to have
a claim of Right to Eternal Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> IV.
4. <hi>To him that worketh; i. e.</hi> does the
works of the Law, <hi>is the reward not
reckoned of Grace, but OF DEBT.</hi> And
<hi>Rev.</hi> XXII. 14. <hi>Blessed are they who do
his Commandments, that they may HAVE
RIGHT to the Tree of Life, which is in
the Paradise of God.</hi> If any of the Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of <hi>Adam</hi> were just, they shall not
lose the Reward of it, Eternal Life and
Bliss, by being his Mortal Issue: Christ
will bring them all to Life again; And
then they shall be put every one upon
his own Tryal, and receive Judgment,
as he is found to be Righteous or no.
And <hi>the righteous,</hi> as our Saviour says,
<hi>Mat.</hi> XXV. 46. <hi>shall go into eternal life.</hi>
Nor shall any one miss it, who has done
what our Saviour directed the Lawyer,
who asked, <hi>Luke</hi> X. 25. <hi>What he should
do to inherit eternal life? Do this, i. e.</hi>
what is required by the Law, <hi>and thou
shalt live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:60354:9"/>
On the other side, it seems the unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable
purpose of the Divine Justice,
that no unrighteous Person, no one that
is guilty of any breach of the Law, should
be in Paradise; But that the wages of sin
shold be to every man, as it was to
<hi>Adam,</hi> an Exclusion of him out of that
Happy state of Immortality, and bring
Death upon him. And this is so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to the Eternal and established
Law of Right and Wrong, that it is
spoke of too as if it could not be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
St. <hi>Iames</hi> says, <hi>Chap.</hi> I. 15. <hi>Sin
when it is finished bringeth forth death,</hi>
as it were by a Natural and necessary
production. <hi>Sin entred into the World,
and death by sin,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> V.
12. &amp; VI. 23. <hi>The wages of sin is Death.</hi>
Death is the Purchase of any, of every
sin. <hi>Gal.</hi> III. 10. <hi>Cursed is every one
who continueth not in all things which
are written in the Book of the Law to
do them.</hi> And of this St. <hi>Iames</hi> gives
a Reason, <hi>Chap.</hi> II. 10, 11. <hi>Whosoever
shall keep the whole Law, and yet of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
in one point, he is guilty of all:
For he that said, Do not commit Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
said also, do not Kill: i. e.</hi> He
that offends in any one Point, sins
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60354:9"/>
against the Authority which established
the Law.</p>
            <p>Here then we have the standing and
fixed measures of Life and Death. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
and Bliss belong to the
Righteous; Those who have lived in
an exact Conformity to the Law of
God, are out of the reach of Death:
But an Exclusion from Paradise, and
loss of Immortality, is the Portion of
Sinners, of all those who have any
way broke that Law, and failed of a
Compleat Obedience to it by the guilt
of any one Transgression. And thus
Mankind by the Law are put upon
the issues of Life or Death; As they
are <hi>Righteous,</hi> or <hi>Vnrighteous; Iust</hi> or
<hi>Vnjust; i. e.</hi> Exact Performers, or Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors
of the Law.</p>
            <p>But yet <hi>all having sinned,</hi> Rom. III.
23. <hi>and come short of the glory God,
i. e.</hi> the Kingdom of God in Heaven,
which is often called his Glory, <hi>both
Iews and Gentiles,</hi> v. 22. So that <hi>by the
deeds of the Law no one could be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
v.</hi> 20. it follows, that no one
could then have Eternal Life and
Bliss.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:60354:10"/>
Perhaps it will be demanded, Why
did God give so hard a Law to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
that to the Apostles time no one
of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Issue had kept it? As appears
by <hi>Rom.</hi> III. and <hi>Gal.</hi> III. 21, 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It was such a Law as the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of God's Nature required, and must
be the Law of such a Creature as Man,
unless God would have made him a
Rational Creature, and not required
him to have lived by the Law of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but would have countenanced in
him Irregularity and Disobedience to
that Light which he had; and that
Rule, which was suitable to his Nature:
Which would have been, to have autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
Disorder, Confusion, and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in his Creatures. For that this Law
was the <hi>Law of Reason,</hi> or as it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>of Nature,</hi> we shall see by and by:
And if Rational Creatures will not live
up to the Rule of their Reason, who
shall excuse them? If you will admit
them to forsake Reason in one point,
why not in another? Where will you
stop? To disobey God in any part of
his Commands (and 'tis he that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
what Reason does) is direct
Rebellion; which if dispensed with in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60354:10"/>
any Point, Government and Order are
at an end; And there can be no bounds
set to the Lawless Exorbitancy of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confined
men. <hi>The Law therefore was,</hi>
as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> VII. 12, <hi>holy,
just, and good,</hi> and such as it ought,
and could not otherwise be.</p>
            <p>This then being the case, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is guilty of any sin, should cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
die, and cease to be, the benefit
of Life restored by Christ at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
would have been no great
Advantage, (for as much as here again
Death must have seized upon all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
because all had sinned; For the
Wages of Sin is every where Death, as
well after as before the Resurrection)
if God had not found out a way to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
some, <hi>i. e.</hi> so many, as obeyed
another Law, which God gave, which
in the New Testament is called <hi>the Law
of Faith,</hi> Rom. III. 27. and is opposed
to <hi>the Law of Works.</hi> And therefore
the Punishment of those who would
not follow him was to lose their Souls.
<hi>i. e.</hi> their Lives, <hi>Mark</hi> VIII. 35-38.
as is plain, considering the occasion it
was spoke on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:60354:11"/>
The better to understand <hi>the Law of
Faith,</hi> it will be convenient in the first
place to consider <hi>the Law of Works.
The Law of Works</hi> then, in short, is that
Law, which requires perfect Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
without any remission or abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
So that by that Law a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be Just, or justified without an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
performance of every tittle. Such
a perfect Obedience in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is termed <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which we
translate <hi>Righteousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Language of this Law is, Do
this and live, Transgress and die. <hi>Lev.</hi>
XVIII. 5. <hi>Ye shall keep my statutes and
my judgments, which if a man do he
shall live in them.</hi> Ezek. XX. 11. <hi>I
gave them my statutes, and shewed them
my judgments, which if a man do he
shall even live in them. Moses,</hi> says
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. X. 5. <hi>describeth the
righteousness which is of the Law, that
the man which doth those things shall
live in them.</hi> Gal. III. 12. <hi>The Law
is not of Faith, but that man that doth
them shall live in them.</hi> On the other
side, Transgress and die; no dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
no atonement. <hi>V. 10. Cursed
is every one that continueth not in all
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60354:11"/>
things which are written in the book of
the law to do them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where this Law of Works was to be
found, the New Testament tells us,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) in the Law delivered by <hi>Moses.
Iohn I. 17. The Law was given by</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<hi>but Faith and Truth came by Iesus
Christ.</hi> Cap. VII. 19. <hi>Did not Moses
give you the Law,</hi> says our Saviour, <hi>and
yet none of you keep the Law.</hi> And this
is the Law which he speaks of, where
he asks the Lawyer, <hi>Luke</hi> X. 26. <hi>What
is written in the Law? how readest thou?</hi>
v. 28. <hi>This do and thou shalt live.</hi> This
is that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> so often stiles
the <hi>Law,</hi> without any other distinction,
<hi>Rom.</hi> II. 13. <hi>Not the hearers of the Law
are just before God, but the doers of the
Law are justified.</hi> 'Tis needless to quote
any more places, his Epistles are all
full of it, especially this to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Law given by <hi>Moses</hi> being
not given to all Mankind, How are all
men sinners; since without a Law there
is no Transgression? To this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
<hi>v.</hi> 14. Answers, <hi>For when the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
which have not the Law, do (i. e.</hi>
find it reasonable to do) <hi>by nature the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60354:12"/>
things contained in the Law; these ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not the Law, are a Law unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
Which shew the work of the
Law written in their hearts, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
also bearing witness, and amongst
one another their thoughts accusing or
excusing.</hi> By which, and other places
in the following Chapter, 'tis plain,
that under the Law of Works is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
also the Law of Nature,
knowable by Reason as well as the Law
given by <hi>Moses. For,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
Rom. III. 9. 23. <hi>we have proved both
Iews and Gentiles, that they are all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
sin: For all have sinned, and come
short of the glory of God:</hi> Which they
could not do without a Law.</p>
            <p>Nay, whatever God requires any
where to be done without making any
allowance for Faith, that is a part of
the Law of Works. So the forbidding
<hi>Adam</hi> to eat of the Tree of Knowledge
was part of the Law of Works. Only
we must take notice here, That some
of God's Positive Commands being for
peculiar Ends, and suited to particular
Circumstances of Times, Places, and
Persons, have a limited and only tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
Obligation by vertue of God's
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60354:12"/>
positive Injunction; such as was that
part of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law which concerned
the outward Worship, or Political Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the Jews, and is called the
Ceremonial and Judaical Law, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradistinction
to the Moral part of it;
Which being conformable to the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Law of Right, is of Eternal Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
and therefore remains in force
still under the Gospel; nor is abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the <hi>Law of Faith,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
found some ready to infer, <hi>Rom.</hi> III. 31.
<hi>Do we then make void the Law through
Faith? God forbid; yea, we establish
the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can it be otherwise: For were
there no <hi>Law of Works,</hi> there could be
no <hi>Law of Faith.</hi> For there could be
no need of Faith, which should be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to men for Righteousness, if there
were no Law to be the Rule and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Righteousness, which men failed
in their Obedience to. Where there is
no Law, there is no Sin; all are Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
equally with or without Faith.</p>
            <p>The Rule therefore of Right is the
same that ever it was, the Obligation
to observe it is also the same: The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the <hi>Law of Works</hi> and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60354:13"/>
the <hi>Law of Faith</hi> is only this; that the
<hi>Law of Works</hi> makes no allowance for
failing on any occasion. Those that
obey are Righteous, those that in any
part disobey are unrighteous, and must
not expect Life the Reward of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.
But by the <hi>Law of Faith,</hi> Faith
is allowed to supply the defect of full
Obedience; and so the Believers are
admitted to Life and Immortality as if
they were Righteous. Only here we
must take notice, that when St. <hi>Paul</hi>
says, that the Gospel establishes the
Law, he means the Moral part of the
Law of <hi>Moses:</hi> For that he could not
mean the Ceremonial or Political part
of it, is evident by what I quoted out
of him just now, where he says, <hi>The
Gentiles that do by nature the things
contained in the Law, their Consciences
bearing witness.</hi> For the Gentiles nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did nor thought of the Judaical
or Ceremonial Institutions of <hi>Moses,</hi>
'twas only the Moral part their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
were concerned in. As for the
rest, St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Galatians, Cap.</hi> IV.
they are not under that part of the
Law, which <hi>v.</hi> 3. he calls <hi>Elements of
the World;</hi> and <hi>v. 9. weak and beggarly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60354:13"/>
elements.</hi> And our Saviour himself in
his Gospel-Sermon on the Mount, tells
them, <hi>Mat.</hi> V. 17. That whatever they
might think, he was not come <hi>to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
the Law,</hi> but to make it more full
and strict: For that that is meant by
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is evident from the following
part of that Chapter, where he gives
the Precepts in a stricter sense than they
were received in before. But they are
all Precepts of the Moral Law which
he reinforces. What should become of
the Ritual Law he tells the Woman of
<hi>Samaria</hi> in these words, <hi>Iohn</hi> IV. 21.
23. <hi>The hour cometh when you shall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in this Mountain, nor yet at</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem
<hi>worship the Father. But the true
Worshippers shall worship the Father in
spirit and in truth, for the Father seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
such to worship him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus then as to the Law in short.
The Civil and Ritual part of the Law
delivered by <hi>Moses</hi> obliges not Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
though to the Jews it were a part
of the Law of Works; it being a part
of the Law of Nature, that man ought
to obey every Positive Law of God,
whenever he shall please to make any
such addition to the Law of his Nature.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60354:14"/>
But the Moral part of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law, or
the Moral Law, (which is every where
the same, the Eternal Rule of Right)
obliges Christians and all men every
where, and is to all men the standing
Law of Works. But Christian Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
have the Priviledge to be under
the <hi>Law of Faith</hi> too; which is that
Law whereby God Justifies a man for
Believing, though by his Works he be
not Just or Righteous, <hi>i. e.</hi> though he
came short of Perfect Obedience to the
Law of Works. God alone does, or can,
Justifie or make Just those who by their
Works are not so: Which he doth by
counting their Faith for Righteousness,
<hi>i. e.</hi> for a compleat performance of the
Law. <hi>Rom.</hi> IV. 3. <hi>Abraham believed
God, and it was counted to him for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</hi>
v. 5. <hi>To him that believeth
on him that justifieth the ungodly, his
faith is counted for righteousness.</hi> v. 6. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as</hi> David <hi>also describeth the blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the man unto whom God imputeth
righteousness without works; i. e.</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a full measure of Works, which is
exact Obedience. v. 7. Saying, <hi>Blessed
are they whose iniquities are forgiven,
and whose sins are covered.</hi> v. 8. <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60354:14"/>
is the man to whom the Lord will
not impute sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Faith for which God justified
<hi>Abraham,</hi> what was it? It was the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
God when he engaged his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
in the Covenant he made with
him. This will be plain to any one
who considers these places together,
<hi>Gen. XV. 6. He believed in the Lord,</hi>
or <hi>believed the Lord.</hi> For that the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
Phrase <hi>believing in,</hi> signifies no
more but <hi>believing,</hi> is plain from St.
<hi>Paul</hi>'s citation of this place, <hi>Rom.</hi> IV.
3. where he repeats it thus: <hi>Abraham
believed God,</hi> which he thus explains,
v. 18-22. <hi>who against hope, believed
in hope, that he might become the Father
of many Nations: According to that
which was spoken, so shall thy seed be.
And being not weak in faith, he consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
not his own body now dead, when he
was about an hundred years old, nor yet
the deadness of</hi> Sarah's <hi>womb. He stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered
not at the promise of God through
unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving
glory to God. And being fully perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that what he had promised, he was
also able to perform. And therefore it
was imputed to him for righteousness.</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:60354:15"/>
By which it is clear, that the Faith
which God counted to <hi>Abraham</hi> for
Righteousness, was nothing but a firm
belief of what God declared to him,
and a steadfast relying on him for the
accomplishment of what he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now this,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul,</hi> v. 23, 24.
<hi>was not writ for his</hi> [Abraham<hi>'s] sake
alone, But for us also;</hi> teaching us,
that as <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified for his
Faith, so also ours shall be accounted
to us for Righteousness, if we believe
God as <hi>Abraham</hi> believed him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
'tis plain is meant the firmness of
our Faith without <hi>staggering,</hi> and not
the believing the same Propositions
that <hi>Abraham</hi> believed; <hi>viz.</hi> that though
he and <hi>Sarah</hi> were old, and past the
time and hopes of Children, yet he
should have a Son by her, and by him
become the Father of a great People,
which should possess the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi>
This was what <hi>Abraham</hi> believed,
and was counted to him for Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
But no body I think will say,
that any ones believing this now, shall
be imputed to him for Righteousness.
The Law of Faith then, in short, is for
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60354:15"/>
every one to believe what God requires
him to believe, as a condition of the
Covenant he makes with him; and not
to doubt of the performance of his
Promises. This the Apostle intimates
in the close here, <hi>v. 24. But for us also,
to whom it shall be imputed, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
on him that raised up Iesus our
Lord from the dead.</hi> We must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
examine and see what God requires
us to believe now under the Revelation
of the Gospel: For the belief of one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible,
Eternal, Omnipotent God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of Heaven and Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
before, as well as now.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What we are now required to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
to obtain Eternal Life, is plainly
set down in the Gospel. St.</hi> Iohn <hi>tells
us,</hi> Iohn III. 36. He that believeth on
the Son, hath eternal life; and he that
believeth not the Son, shall not see life.
<hi>What this</hi> believing on him <hi>is, we are
also told in the next Chapter.</hi> The
woman saith unto him, I know that the
Messiah cometh: When he is come, he will
tell us all things. Iesus said unto her,
I that spake unto thee am he. The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
then went into the City, and saith
to the men, come see a man that hath
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60354:16"/>
told me all things that ever I did. Is
not this the Messiah? And many of the
<hi>Samaritans</hi> believed on him; for the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the woman, who testified, he told
me all that ever I did. So when the
<hi>Samaritans</hi> were come unto him, many
more believed because of his words, and
said to the woman; We believe not any
longer because of thy saying, for we have
heard our selves, and we know that this
Man is truly the Saviour of the World,
the Messiah, <hi>John IV.</hi> 25, 26. 29. 39,
40, 41, 42.</p>
            <p>By which place it is plain, that <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
on the Son</hi> is the <hi>believing that
Iesus was the Messiah;</hi> giving Credit
to the Miracles he did, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
he made of himself. For those
who were said to BELIEVE ON
HIM for the saying of the Woman,
<hi>v.</hi> 39. tell the Woman, that they now
believed not any longer because of her
saying; but that having heard him
themselves, they knew, <hi>i. e.</hi> BELIEVED
past doubt THAT HE WAS THE
MESSIAH.</p>
            <p>This was the great Proposition that
was then controverted concerning Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> whether he was the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60354:16"/>
               <hi>Messiah</hi> or no; And the assent to that,
was that which distinguished Believers
form Unbelievers. When many of his
Disciples had forsaken him, upon his
declaring that he was the Bread of Life
which came down from Heaven, <hi>He
said to the Apostles, will ye also go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way?
<hi>Then</hi> Simon Peter <hi>answered him;
Lord,</hi> to whom shall we go? Thou hast
the words of eternal life. And we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and are sure thou art the Messiah,
the Son of the living God,</hi> Iohn VI. 69.
This was the Faith which distinguished
them form Apostates and Unbelievers,
and was sufficient to continue them in
the rank of Apostles: And it was upon
the same Proposition, <hi>That Iesus was
the Messiah the Son of the living God,</hi>
owned by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> that our Saviour
said, he would build his Church. <hi>Mat.</hi>
XVI. 16-18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To convince men of this he did his
Miracles: And their assent to, or not
assenting to this, made them to be, or
not to be of his Church; Believers, or
not Believers.</hi> The Iews came round
about him, and said unto him, how long
dost thou make us doubt? If thou be the
Messiah tell us plainly. Iesus answered
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60354:17"/>
them; I told you, and ye believed not:
The works that I do in my Father's
name they bear witness of me. But ye
believe not, because ye are not of my
sheep, <hi>John X. 24-26. Conformable
hereunto St.</hi> Iohn <hi>tells us,</hi> That many
deceivers are entered into the world, who
confess not that Iesus, the Messiah, is come
in the flesh. This is a deceiver, and
an Antichrist, whosoever abideth not in
the Doctrine of the Messiah has not God.
He that abideth in the Doctrine of the
Messiah, i. e. <hi>that Jesus is he,</hi> hath both
the Father and the Son, 2 <hi>John 7. 9, 10.
That this is the meaning of the place,
is plain from what he says in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Epistle,</hi> Whosoever believeth that
Iesus is the Messiah, is born of God,
1 <hi>John V. 1. And therefore drawing
to a close of his Gospel, and shewing
the end for which he writ it, he has
these words:</hi> Many other signs truly did
Iesus in the presence of his Disciples,
which are not written in this book; but
these are written, that ye may believe
that Iesus is the Messiah, the Son of God;
and that believing ye might have life
through his name, <hi>John XX. 30, 31.
Whereby it is plain, that the Gospel
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60354:17"/>
was writ to induce men into a belief
of this Proposition,</hi> that Iesus of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth
was the Messiah; <hi>Which if they
believed, they should</hi> have life.</p>
            <p>Accordingly the great Question a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Jews was, whether he were
the <hi>Messiah</hi> or no: And the great Point
insisted on and promulgated in the
Gospel was, that he was the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
The first glad tidings of his Birth,
brought to the Shepherds by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
was in these words: <hi>Fear not, for
behold I bring you good tidings of great
joy, which shall be to all people; For to
you is born this day in the City of</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
<hi>a Saviour, who is the Messiah the
Lord,</hi> Luke II. 11. Our Saviour Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
with <hi>Martha</hi> about the means
of attaining Eternal Life, saith to her,
<hi>Iohn</hi> XI. 27. <hi>Whosoever believeth in
me shall never die. Believest thou this?
She saith unto him, Yea, Lord, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that thou art the Messiah, the Son
of God, which should come into the world.</hi>
This Answer of hers sheweth what it
is to believe in Jesus Christ, so as to
have Eternal Life, <hi>viz.</hi> to believe that
he is the <hi>Messiah</hi> the Son of God, whose
coming was foretold by the Prophets.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60354:18"/>
And thus <hi>Andrew</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> express
it: Andrew <hi>says to his Brother</hi> Simon,
<hi>we have found the Messiah, which is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
interpreted, the Christ.</hi> Philip <hi>saith
to</hi> Nathanael, <hi>we have found him of
whom</hi> Moses <hi>in the Law, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
did write, Iesus of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>the
Son of</hi> Joseph, <hi>Iohn</hi> I. 41. 45. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to what the Evangelist says in this
place, I have, for the clearer understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Scripture, all along put
<hi>Messiah</hi> for <hi>Christ. Christ</hi> being but
the Greek name for the Hebrew <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi>
and both signifying <hi>The Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that he was the <hi>Messiah,</hi> was the
great Truth he took pains to convince
his Disciples and Apostles of; appearing
to them after his Resurrection: As may
be seen, <hi>Luke</hi> XXIV. which we shall
more particularly consider in another
place. There we read what Gospel
our Saviour Preach'd to his Disciples
and Apostles; And That, as soon as he
was risen from the Dead, twice the
very day of his Resurrection.</p>
            <p>And if we may gather what was to
be believed by all Nations, from what
was preached unto them; we may
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60354:18"/>
observe, that the Preaching of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
every where in the <hi>Acts</hi> tended
to this one Point, to prove that Jesus
was the <hi>Messiah.</hi> Indeed, now after his
Death, his Resurrection was also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
required to be believed as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Article, and sometimes solely
insisted on: It being a mark and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Evidence of his being the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi>
and necessary now to be believed
by those who would receive him as
the <hi>Messiah.</hi> For since the <hi>Messiah</hi> was
to be a Saviour and a King, and to give
Life and a Kingdom to those who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him, as we shall see by and by,
there could have been no Pretence to
have given him out for the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
and to require men to believe him to
be so, who thought him under the
Power of Death, and Corruption of
the Grave. And therefore those who
believed him to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> must
believe that he was risen from the
Dead: And those who believed him to
be risen from the Dead, could not doubt
of his being the <hi>Messiah.</hi> But of this
more in another place.</p>
            <p>Let us see therefore how the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
preached Christ, and what they
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60354:19"/>
proposed to their Hearers to believe.
St. <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem, Acts</hi> II. by his
first Sermon, converted Three Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Souls. What <hi>was his word,</hi> which,
as we are told, <hi>v. 41. they gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and thereupon were baptized?</hi>
That may be seen from <hi>v.</hi> 22. to <hi>v.</hi> 36.
In short this; Which is the Conclusion
drawn from all that he had said, and
which he presses on them as the thing
they were to believe, <hi>viz. Therefore
let all the House of</hi> Israel <hi>know assuredly,
that God hath made that same Iesus,
whom ye have crucified, Lord and Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi>
v. 36.</p>
            <p>To the same purpose was his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to the Jews in the Temple,
<hi>Acts</hi> III. the design whereof you have,
<hi>v. 18. But those things that God before
had shewed by the mouth of all his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
that the Messiah should suffer, he
hath so fulfilled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next Chapter <hi>Acts</hi> IV. <hi>Peter</hi>
and <hi>Iohn</hi> being examined about the
Miracle on the lame Man, profess it
to have been done in the Name
of Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> who was the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> in whom alone there was Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<hi>v.</hi> 10-12. The same thing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60354:19"/>
they confirm to them again, <hi>Acts</hi> V.
29-32. <hi>And daily in the Temple, and
in every House they ceased not to teach
and preach Iesus the Messiah,</hi> v. 42.</p>
            <p>What was <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Speech to the
Council, <hi>Acts</hi> VII. but a Reprehension
to them, that they were the Betrayers
and Murderers of the <hi>Iust One?</hi> Which
is the Title by which he plainly designs
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> whose coming was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shewn
by the Prophets, <hi>v.</hi> 51, 52. And
that the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to be without sin
(which is the import of the word
Just) was the Opinion of the Jews,
appears from <hi>Iohn</hi> IX. <hi>v.</hi> 22. compared
with 24.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Acts</hi> VIII. <hi>Philip</hi> carries the Gospel
to <hi>Samaria. Then</hi> Philip <hi>went down to</hi>
Samaria, <hi>and preached to them.</hi> What
was it he preached? You have an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of it in this one word, <hi>The Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,
v.</hi> 5. This being that alone which
was required of them, to believe that
<hi>Iesus</hi> was the <hi>Messiah;</hi> which, when
they believed, they were baptized. <hi>And
when they believed</hi> Philip<hi>'s Preaching
the Gospel of the Kingdom of God, and
the name of Iesus the Messiah, they were
baptized both Men and Women,</hi> v. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:60354:20"/>
               <hi>Philip</hi> being sent from thence, by a
special call of the Spirit, to make an
Eminent Convert, out of <hi>Isaiah</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to him Jesus, <hi>v.</hi> 35. And what
it was he preached concerning <hi>Iesus,</hi>
we may know by the Profession of
Faith the Eunuch made, upon which
he was admitted to Baptism. <hi>v. 37. I
believe that Iesus Christ is the Son of
God:</hi> Which is as much as to say, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that he, whom you call Jesus
Christ, is really and truly the <hi>Messiah</hi>
that was promised. For that believing
him to be the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and to be
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> was the same thing, may
appear by comparing <hi>Iohn</hi> I. 45. with
<hi>v.</hi> 49. where <hi>Nathanael</hi> owns Jesus to
be the <hi>Messiah</hi> in these terms: <hi>Thou
art the Son of God; Thou art the King
of Israel.</hi> So the Jews, <hi>Luke</hi> XXII. 70.
asking Christ, whether he were the
<hi>Son of God;</hi> plainly demand of him,
whether he were the <hi>Messiah?</hi> Which
is evident by comparing that with the
three preceding Verses. They ask him,
<hi>v.</hi> 67. whether he were the <hi>Messiah?</hi>
He answers, <hi>If I tell you, you will not
believe;</hi> but withal tells them, that
from thenceforth he should be in Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60354:20"/>
of the Kingdom of the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
expressed in these words, <hi>v. 69. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
shall the Son of Man sit on the right
hand of the power of God:</hi> Which made
them all cry our, <hi>Art thou then the Son
of God? i. e.</hi> Dost thou then own thy
self to be the <hi>Messiah?</hi> To which he
replies; <hi>Ye say that I am.</hi> That the
<hi>Son of God</hi> was the known Title of the
<hi>Messiah</hi> at that time amongst the Jews,
we may see also from what the Jews
say to <hi>Pilate,</hi> John XIX. 7. <hi>We have
a Law, and by our Law he ought to die,
because he made himself THE SON
OF GOD; i. e.</hi> by making himself
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the Prophet which was to
come, but falsely; and therefore he
deserves to die by the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> XVIII.
20. That this was the common sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of <hi>the Son of God,</hi> is farther
evident form what the Chief Priests,
mocking him, said, when he was at the
Cross, <hi>Mat.</hi> XXVII. 42. <hi>He saved
others, himself he cannot save: If he
be the King of</hi> Israel, <hi>let him now come
down from the Cross, and we will believe
him. He trusted in God, let him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
him now, if he will have him; for
he said, I am the SON OF GOD;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60354:21"/>
i. e.</hi> he said, he was the <hi>Messiah:</hi> But
'tis plainly false; for if he were, God
would deliver him: For the <hi>Messiah</hi> is
to be King of <hi>Israel,</hi> the Saviour of
others; but this Man cannot save him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
The Chief Priests mention here
the two Titles then in use whereby the
Jews commonly designed the <hi>Messiah,
viz. Son of God,</hi> and <hi>King of Israel.</hi>
That of <hi>Son of God,</hi> was so familiar a
compellation of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> who was
then so much expected and talked of,
that the <hi>Romans</hi> it seems, who lived
amongst them, had learned it; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from <hi>v. 54. Now when the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion,
and they that were with him,
watching Iesus, saw the Earthquake, and
those things that were done, they feared
greatly, saying, Truly this was the SON
OF GOD;</hi> this was that extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Person that was looked for.</p>
            <p>Acts <hi>IX. St.</hi> Paul <hi>exercising the
Commission to Preach the Gospel, which
he had received in a Miraculous way,</hi>
v. 20. Straitway preached Christ in the
Synagogues, that he is the Son of God;
i. e. <hi>that Jesus was the</hi> Messiah: <hi>For
Christ in this place is evidently a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Name. And that this was it which</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:60354:21"/>
Paul <hi>preached, appears from</hi> v. 22.
Saul increased the more in strength, and
confounded the Jews who dwelt in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascus,</hi>
proving that this is the very
Christ, i. e. <hi>the</hi> Messiah.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter,</hi> when he came to <hi>Cornelius</hi> at
<hi>Cesarea;</hi> who by a Vision was ordered
to send for him, as <hi>Peter</hi> on the other
side was by a Vision commanded to go
to him; What does he teach him?
His whole Discourse, <hi>Acts</hi> X. tends to
shew what he says God commanded
the Apostles <hi>to Preach unto the People,
and to testifie; That it is he</hi> [Jesus]
<hi>which was ordained of God to be the
Iudge of the quick and the dead.</hi> And
that it was <hi>to him that all the Prophets
give witness, that through his name who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
believeth in him shall have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sins,</hi> v. 42, 43. This is <hi>the
Word which God sent to the Children of</hi>
Israel; <hi>that WORD which was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
throughout all</hi> Judea, <hi>and began
from</hi> Galilee, <hi>after the Baptism which</hi>
Iohn <hi>preached,</hi> v. 36, 37. And these
are the <hi>words</hi> which had been promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Acts XI. 14. <hi>Whereby
he and all his house should be saved:</hi>
Which <hi>words</hi> amount only to thus
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60354:22"/>
much, That <hi>Iesus</hi> was <hi>the Messiah,</hi> the
Saviour that was promised. Upon
their receiving of this (for this was
all was taught them) the Holy Ghost
fell on them, and they were baptized.
'Tis observable here, that the Holy
Ghost fell on them before they were
baptized; which in other places Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
received not till after Baptism.
The reason whereof seems to be this;
That God by bestowing on them the
Holy Ghost, did thus declare from
Heaven, that the Gentiles, upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<hi>Iesus</hi> to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> ought
to be admitted into the Church by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
as well as the Jews. Whoever
reads St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Defence, <hi>Acts</hi> XI. when
he was accused by those of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
that he had not kept that
distance which he ought with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcised,
will be of this Opinion;
and see by what he says, <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16, 17.
That this was the ground, and an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistible
Authority to him for doing
so strange a thing, as it appeared to
the Jews (who alone yet were Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Christian Church) to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
Gentiles into their Communion,
upon their believing. And therefore
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60354:22"/>
St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in the foregoing Chapter,
<hi>Acts</hi> X before he would Baptize them,
proposes this Question <hi>to those of the
Circumcision, which came with him, and
were astonished, because that on the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
also was poured out the gift of the
Holy Ghost: Can any one forbid water,
that these should not be baptized, who
have received the Holy Ghost as well as
we?</hi> v. 47. And when some of the
Sect of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who believed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
thought <hi>it needful that the converted</hi>
Gentiles <hi>should be circumcised, and keep
the Law of Moses,</hi> Acts XV. Peter <hi>rose
up and said unto them, Men and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
you know that a good while ago
God made choice amongst us, that the
Gentiles,</hi> viz. <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and those here
converted with him, <hi>by my mouth should
hear the Gospel, and believe. And God,
who knoweth the hearts, bear them wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
giving them the Holy Ghost, even
as he did unto us, and put no difference
between us and them, purifying their
hearts by Faith,</hi> v. 7-9. So that both
Jews and Gentiles, who believed Jesus
to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> received thereupon
the Seal of Baptism; whereby they
were owned to be his, and distinguished
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60354:23"/>
from Unbelievers. From what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
-said, we may observe, That this
Preaching Jesus to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> is
called <hi>the Word,</hi> and <hi>the Word of
God;</hi> and believing it, <hi>receiving the
Word of God. Vid.</hi> Acts X. 36, 37. &amp;
XI. 1. 19, 20. And <hi>the Word of the
Gospel,</hi> Acts XV. 7. And so likewise
in the History of the Gospel, what
<hi>Mark,</hi> Chap. IV. 14, 15. calls simply
the <hi>Word,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> calls <hi>the Word of
God, Luke</hi> XIII. 11. And St. <hi>Matthew,
Chap.</hi> XIII. 19. <hi>the Word of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi>
which were, it seems, in the
Gospel-writers Synonymous terms, and
are so to be understood by us.</p>
            <p>But to go on: <hi>Acts</hi> XIII. <hi>Paul</hi> Preaches
in the Synagogue at <hi>Antioch,</hi> where he
makes it his business to convince the
Jews, that <hi>God, according to his promise,
had of the seed of</hi> David <hi>raised to</hi> Israel
<hi>a Saviour, Iesus,</hi> v. 24. That he was <hi>He</hi>
of whom the Prophets writ, <hi>v. 25-29.
i. e.</hi> the <hi>Messiah:</hi> And that as a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of his being so, God had raised
him from the Dead, <hi>v.</hi> 30. From whence
be argues thus, <hi>v.</hi> 32, 33. <hi>We Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelize
to you,</hi> or bring you this Gospel,
<hi>how that the Promise which was made
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60354:23"/>
to our Fathers, God hath fulfilled the
same unto us, in that he hath raised up
Iesus again; as it is also written in the
second Psalm, Thou art my Son, this day
have I begotten thee.</hi> And having gone
on to prove him to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> by
his Resurrection from the Dead, he
makes this Conclusion; <hi>v. 38, 39. Be
it known unto you therefore, men and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
that through this man is preached
unto you forgiveness of sins; and by him
all who believe are justified from all
things, from which they could not be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by the Law of</hi> Moses. This is
in this Chapter called <hi>the Word of God</hi>
over and over again: Compare <hi>v.</hi> 42.
with 44. 46. 48, 49. And <hi>Chap.</hi> XII.
<hi>v.</hi> 24.</p>
            <p>Acts <hi>XVII. 2-4. At</hi> Thessalonica,
Paul, as his manner was, went into the
Synagogue, and three Sabbath-days rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
with the Iews out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
opening and alledging, that the
<hi>Messiah</hi> must needs have suffered, and
risen again from the dead: And that
this Iesus, whom I preach unto you, is
the <hi>Messiah.</hi> And some of them belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and consorted with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas:</hi>
But the Iews which believed not, set
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60354:24"/>
the City in an uproar. <hi>Can there
be any thing plainer, than that the
assenting to this Proposition, that Jesus
was the</hi> Messiah, <hi>was that which distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
the Believers from the Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers?
For this was that alone which,
three Sabbaths,</hi> Paul <hi>endeavoured to
convince them of, as the Text tells us
in direct words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From thence he went to <hi>Berea,</hi> and
preached the same thing: And the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans</hi>
are commended, <hi>v.</hi> 11. for search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scriptures, whether those things,
i. e. which he had said, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Jesus his being the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
were true or no.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The same Doctrine we find him
Preaching at</hi> Corinth, Acts <hi>XVIII. 4-6.</hi>
And he reasoned in the Synagogue every
Sabbath, and perswaded the Iews and
the Greeks. And when <hi>Silas</hi> and <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus</hi>
were come from <hi>Macedonia, Paul</hi>
was pressed in spirit, and testified to the
Iews, that Iesus was the <hi>Messiah.</hi> And
when they opposed themselves, and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed,
he shook his raiment, and said
unto them, your blood be upon your own
heads, I am clean; from henceforth I
will go unto the Greeks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:60354:24"/>
Upon the like occasion he tells the
Jews at <hi>Antioch, Acts</hi> XIII. 46. <hi>It was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
that the Word of God should first
have been spoken to you: But seeing you
put it off from you, we turn to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>
'Tis plain here, St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s charging
their Blood on their own heads, is for
opposing this single Truth, that <hi>Iesus</hi>
was the <hi>Messiah;</hi> that Salvation or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
depends upon believing or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
this one Proposition. I mean,
this is all is required to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by those who acknowledge but
one Eternal and Invisible God, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of Heaven and Earth, as the Jews
did. For that there is something more
required to Salvation, besides believing,
we shall see hereafter. In the mean
time, it is fit here on this occasion to
take notice, that though the Apostles
in their Preaching to the Jews, and the
<hi>Devout,</hi> (as we translate the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
who were Proselytes of the
Gate, and the worshippers of one E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
and Invisible God,) said nothing
of the believing in this one true God,
the maker of Heaven and Earth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was needless to press this to
those who believed and professed it
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60354:25"/>
already (for to such, 'tis plain, were
most of their Discourses hitherto)
Yet when they had to do with Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Heathens, who were not yet
come to the knowledge of the one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true God; they began with that,
as necessary to be believed; it being
the Foundation on which the other
was built, and without which it could
signifie nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus</hi> Paul <hi>speaking to the Idolatrous</hi>
Lystrians, <hi>who would have sacrificed
to him and</hi> Barnabas, <hi>says,</hi> Acts <hi>XIV.
15.</hi> We Preach unto you, that you should
turn from these vanities unto the living
God, who made Heaven, and Earth,
and the Sea, and all things that are
therein. Who in times past suffered all
Nations to walk in their own ways. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
he left not himself without
witness in that he did good, and gave
us rain from Heaven, and fruitful sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
filling our hearts with food and
gladness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus also he proceeded with the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous</hi>
Athenians, Acts <hi>XVII. Telling
them, upon occasion of the Altar de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to the unknown God,</hi> Whom
ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60354:25"/>
you; God who made the World, and all
things therein: Seeing that he is Lord of
Heaven and Earth, dwelleth not in
Temples made with hands.—Forasmuch
then as we are the Off-spring of God, we
ought not to think that the Godhead is
like unto Gold, or Silver, or Stone, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by art, and man's device. And
the times of this ignorance God winked
at; But now commandeth all men every
where to repent: Because he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
a day in which he will judge the
World in Righteousness, by that man
whom he hath ordained: Whereof he
hath given assurance unto all men, in
that he hath raised him from the dead.
<hi>So that we see, where any thing more
was necessary to be proposed to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
as there was to the Heathen
Idolaters, there the Apostles were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
not to omit it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Acts XVIII. 4. Paul <hi>at</hi> Corinth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
in the Synagogue every Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
and testified to the Iews, that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
was the <hi>Messiah.</hi> Ver. 11. And he
continued there a year and six months,
teaching the Word of God amongst them;
i. e. <hi>The good News, that Jesus was
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60354:26"/>
the</hi> Messiah; <hi>as we have already shewn
is meant by the</hi> Word of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Apollos,</hi> another Preacher of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
when he was instructed in the
way of God more perfectly, what did
he teach but this same Doctrine? As
we may see in this account of him,
<hi>Acts</hi> XVIII. 27. That <hi>when he was come
into</hi> Achaia, <hi>he helped the Brethren
much who had believed through grace.
For he mightily convinced the Iews, and
that publickly, shewing by the Scriptures
that Iesus was the</hi> Messiah.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the Account he gives of
himself before <hi>Festus</hi> and <hi>Agrippa,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
this alone to be the Doctrine he
taught after his Conversion: For, says
he, <hi>Acts</hi> XXVI. 22. <hi>Having obtained
help of God, I continue unto this day,
witnessing both to small and great, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
none other things than those which
the Prophets and</hi> Moses <hi>did say should
come: That the</hi> Messias <hi>should suffer,
and that he should be the first that should
rise from the dead, and should shew light
unto the People, and to the Gentiles.</hi>
Which was no more than to prove that
Jesus was the <hi>Messiah.</hi> This is that, which,
as we have above observed, is called
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60354:26"/>
the <hi>Word of God; Acts</hi> XI. 1. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the foregoing Chapter, from
<hi>v.</hi> 34. to the end. And XIII. 42. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with 44. 46. 48, 49. And XVII.
13. compared with <hi>v.</hi> 11. 3. It is
also called <hi>the Word of the Gospel,
Acts</hi> XV. 7. And this is that <hi>Word
of God,</hi> and that <hi>Gospel,</hi> which, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
their Discourses are set down, we
find the Apostles preached; and was
that Faith, which made both Jews and
Gentiles Believers and Members of the
Church of Christ; purifying their
hearts, <hi>Acts</hi> XV. 9. And carrying with
it Remission of sins, <hi>Acts</hi> X. 43. So
that all that was to be believed for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
was no more but this single
Proposition; That <hi>Iesus of</hi> Nazareth
<hi>was the Christ, or the Messiah.</hi> All, I
say, that was to be believed for Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication:
For that it was not all that
was required to be done for Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we shall see hereafter.</p>
            <p>Though we have seen above from
what our Saviour has Pronounced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<hi>Iohn</hi> III. 36. <hi>That he that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
on the Son, hath everlasting life;
and he that believeth not the Son, shall
not see life, but the wrath of God abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60354:27"/>
on him;</hi> And are taught from
<hi>Iohn</hi> IV. 39. compared with <hi>v.</hi> 42.
<hi>That believing on him, is believing that
he is the</hi> Messiah, <hi>the Saviour of the
World;</hi> And the Confession made by
St. <hi>Peter, Mat.</hi> XVI. 16. That he is
<hi>the Messiah, the Son of the living God,</hi>
being the Rock, on which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
has promised to build his Church;
Though this, I say, and what else we
have already taken notice of, be enough
to convince us what it is we are in the
Gospel required to believe to Eternal
Life, without adding what we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
from the Preaching of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles;
Yet it may not be amiss, for
the farther clearing this matter, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
what the Evangelists deliver con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the same thing, though in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
words; Which therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
are not so generally taken notice
of to this purpose.</p>
            <p>We have above observed, from the
words of <hi>Andrew</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> compared,
That the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and <hi>him of whom</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<hi>in the Law and the Prophets did
write,</hi> signifie the same thing. We shall
now consider that place, <hi>Iohn</hi> I. a little
further. <hi>Ver. 41. Andrew</hi> says to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60354:27"/>
               <hi>Simon, We have found the Messiah. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi>
on the same occasion, <hi>v. 45. says
to</hi> Nathanael, <hi>We have found him, of
whom</hi> Moses <hi>in the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
did write, Iesus of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>the
Son of</hi> Joseph <hi>Nathanael,</hi> who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believed
this, when upon Christ's speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him, he was convinced of it,
declares his assent to it in these words;
<hi>Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art
the King of Israel.</hi> From which it is
evident, that to believe him to be <hi>Him
of whom</hi> Moses <hi>and the Prophets did
write,</hi> or to be the <hi>Son of God,</hi> or to
be the <hi>King of Israel,</hi> was in effect the
same as to believe him to be the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah:</hi>
And an assent to that, was what
our Saviour received for believing. For
upon <hi>Nathanael</hi>'s making a confession
in these words, <hi>Thou art the Son of God,
thou art the King of Israel; Iesus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
and said to him, Because I said
to thee, I saw thee under the Fig-tree,
dost thou BELIEVE? Thou shalt
see greater things than these,</hi> v. 51. I
desire any, one to read the latter part
of the first of <hi>Iohn,</hi> from <hi>v.</hi> 25. with
attention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and tell me, whether it be
not plain, that this Phrase, <hi>The Son of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60354:28"/>
God,</hi> is an Expression used for the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah.</hi>
To which let him add <hi>Martha's</hi>
declaration of her Faith, <hi>Iohn</hi> XI. 27.
in these words; <hi>I believe that thou art
the Messiah, THE SON OF GOD,
who should come into the World;</hi> And
that passage of St. <hi>Iohn, Chap.</hi> XX. 31.
<hi>That ye might believe that Iesus is the
Messiah, THE SON OF GOD; and
that believing, ye might have life through
his name:</hi> And then tell me whether
he can doubt that <hi>Messiah</hi> and <hi>Son of
God</hi> were Synonymous terms, at that
time, amongst the Jews.</p>
            <p>The Prophecy of <hi>Daniel, Chap.</hi> IX.
where he is called <hi>Messiah the Prince;</hi>
And the mention of his Government
and Kingdom, and the deliverance by
him, in <hi>Isaiah, Daniel,</hi> and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies,
understood of the <hi>Messiah;</hi> were
so well known to the Jews, and had so
raised their hopes of him about this
time, which by their account was to
be the time of his coming to restore
the Kingdom to <hi>Israel,</hi> That <hi>Herod</hi>
no sooner heard of the <hi>Magi</hi>'s enquiry
after <hi>him that was born King of the Iews,
Mat.</hi> II. But he forthwith <hi>demanded of
the chief Priests and Scribes, where the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60354:28"/>
Messiah should be born,</hi> v. 4. Not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but if there were any King born
to the Jews, it was the <hi>Messiah:</hi> Whose
Coming was now the general Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as appears, <hi>Luke</hi> III. 15. <hi>The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
being in expectation, and all men
musing in their hearts of</hi> John, <hi>whether
he were the</hi> Messiah <hi>or not.</hi> And when
the Priests and Levites sent to ask him
who he was; He understanding their
meaning, answers, <hi>Iohn</hi> I. 19. That
he was <hi>not the Messiah:</hi> But he bears
witness that Jesus <hi>is the Son of God, i. e.</hi>
the <hi>Messiah, v.</hi> 34.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This looking for the</hi> Messiah <hi>at this
time, we see also in</hi> Simeon; <hi>who is
said to be</hi> waiting for the consolation of
Israel, Luke <hi>II. 21. And having the
Child Jesus in his Arms, he says he had</hi>
seen the Salvation of the Lord, v. 30.
<hi>And</hi> Anna coming at the same instant
into the Temple, she gave thanks also
unto the Lord, and spake of him to all
them that looked for Redemption in Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
<hi>v. 38. And of</hi> Ioseph <hi>of</hi> Arima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea,
<hi>it is said,</hi> Mark <hi>XV. 43. That</hi>
he also expected the Kingdom of God:
<hi>By all which was meant the Coming
of the</hi> Messiah. <hi>And</hi> Luke <hi>XIX. 11.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60354:29"/>
'tis said,</hi> They thought that the Kingdom
of God should immediately appear.</p>
            <p>This being premised, let us see what
it was that <hi>Iohn the Baptist</hi> preached,
when he first entred upon his Ministry.
That St. <hi>Matthew</hi> tells us, <hi>Chap.</hi> III. 1,
2. <hi>In those days came</hi> John the Baptist
<hi>preaching in the Wilderness of</hi> Judea,
<hi>saying, Repent, for the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is at hand.</hi> This was a declaration
of the Coming of the <hi>Messiah;</hi> the
<hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom of
God</hi> being the same, as is clear out of
several places of the Evangelists; and
both signifying the Kingdom of the
<hi>Messiah.</hi> The Profession which <hi>Iohn
the Baptist</hi> made, when sent to the
Jews, <hi>Iohn I.</hi> 19. was, That <hi>he was not
the Messiah;</hi> but that Jesus was. This
will appear to any one, who will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<hi>v.</hi> 26-34. With <hi>Iohn</hi> III. 27. 30.
The Jews being very inquisitive to
know whether <hi>Iohn</hi> were the <hi>Messiah;</hi>
he positively denies it, but tells them,
he was only his Fore-runner; and that
there stood one amongst them, who
would follow him, whose Shoe-latchet
he was not worthy to untie. The next
day seeing Jesus, he says, he was the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60354:29"/>
Man; and that his own Baptizing in
Water, was only that <hi>Iesus</hi> might be
manifested to the World; and that he
knew him not, till he saw the Holy
Ghost descend upon him. He that
sent him to Baptize having told him,
that he on whom he should see the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
decend, and rest upon, he it was
that should Baptize with the Holy
Ghost; And that therefore he witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that <hi>this was the Son of God,</hi> v. 34.
i. e. the <hi>Messiah.</hi> And <hi>Chap.</hi> III. 26, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
They came to <hi>Iohn the Baptist,</hi> and tell
him, that <hi>Iesus</hi> baptized, and that all
Men went to him. <hi>Iohn</hi> answers, He
has his Authority from Heaven; You
know I never said, I was the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
but that I was sent before him; He
must increase, but I must decrease;
For God hath sent him, and he speaks
the words of God; And God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
all things into the hands of his
Son, <hi>And he that believes on the Son,
hath eternal life;</hi> The same Doctrine,
and nothing else but what was preached
by the Apostles afterwards: As we have
seen all through the <hi>Acts, v. g.</hi> that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
was the <hi>Messiah.</hi> And thus it was
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60354:30"/>
that <hi>Iohn</hi> bears witness of our Saviour,
as Jesus himself says, <hi>Iohn</hi> V. 33.</p>
            <p>This also was the Declaration was
given of him at his Baptism, by a voice
from Heaven; <hi>This is my beloved Son,
in whom I am well pleased, Mat.</hi> III. 17.
Which was a declaration of him to be
the <hi>Messiah; the Son of God</hi> being (as
we have shewed) understood to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the <hi>Messiah.</hi> To which we may add
the first mention of him after his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
in the words of the Angel to
<hi>Ioseph;</hi> Mat. I. 21. <hi>Thou shalt call his
name Iesus,</hi> or Saviour; <hi>for he shall
save his people from their sins.</hi> It was
a received Doctrine in the Jewish Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that at the Coming of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi>
all their sins should be forgiven
them. These words therefore of the
Angel we may look on as a declaration,
that Jesus was the <hi>Messiah;</hi> whereof
these words, <hi>his People,</hi> are a further
mark; which suppose him to have a
People, and consequently to be a
King.</p>
            <p>After his Baptism, Jesus himself en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
upon his Ministry. But before we
examine what it was he proposed to
be believed, we must observe, that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60354:30"/>
there is a three-fold declaration of the
<hi>Messiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. By Miracles. The Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
had now for many Ages forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Jews: And though their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth
were not quite dissolved,
but that they lived under their own
laws, yet they were under a Foreign
Dominion, subject to the <hi>Romans.</hi> In
this state their account of the time
being up, they were in expectation of
the <hi>Messiah;</hi> and of deliverance by
him in a Kingdom, he was to set up,
according to their Ancient Prophesies
of him: Which gave them hopes of
an extraordinary Man yet to come
from God, who with an Extraordinary
and Divine Power, and Miracles, should
evidence his Mission, and work their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.
And of any such extraordinary
Person who should have the Power of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Miracles, they had no other expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
but only of their <hi>Messiah.</hi> One
great Prophet and worker of Miracles,
and only One more, they expected; who
was to be the <hi>Messiah.</hi> And therefore
we see the People justified their <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
in him, i. e.</hi> their believing him
to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> because of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60354:31"/>
he did; <hi>Iohn</hi> VII. 31. <hi>And many
of the people believed in him, and said,
when the</hi> Messiah <hi>cometh, will he do
more Miracles than this man hath done?</hi>
And when the Jews, at the Feast of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,
<hi>Iohn</hi> X. 24, 25. coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, said unto him, <hi>How long
dost thou make us doubt? If thou be the</hi>
Messiah, <hi>tell us plainly. Iesus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
them, I told you, and ye believed
not; the works that I do in my Father's
name, bear witness of me.</hi> And <hi>Iohn</hi> V.
36. He says, <hi>I have a greater witness
than that of</hi> John; <hi>for the works which
the Father hath given me to do, the
same works that I do, bear witness of
me, that the Father hath sent me.</hi> Where,
by the way, we may observe, that his
being <hi>sent by the Father,</hi> is but another
way of expressing the <hi>Messiah;</hi> Which
is evident from this place here, <hi>Iohn</hi> V.
compared with that of <hi>Iohn</hi> X. last
quoted. For there he says, that his
Works bear witness of him: And what
was that witness? <hi>viz.</hi> That he was
the <hi>Messiah.</hi> Here again he says, that
his works bear witness? of him: And
what is that witness? <hi>viz. That the
Father sent him.</hi> By which we are
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60354:31"/>
taught, that to be sent by the Father,
and to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> was the same
thing, in his way of declaring himself.
And accordingly we find, <hi>Iohn</hi> IV. 53.
&amp; XI. 45. and elsewhere, many heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
and assented to this Testimony,
and believed on him, seeing the things
that he did.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Another way of declaring the
Coming of the</hi> Messiah, <hi>was by Phrases
and Circumlocutions, that did signifie or
intimate his Coming; though not in
direct words pointing out the Person.
The most usual of these were,</hi> The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God, and of Heaven; <hi>because
it was that which was oftnest spoken
of the</hi> Messiah, <hi>in the Old Testament,
in very plain words: And a Kingdom
was that which the Jews most looked
after, and wished for. In that known
place,</hi> Isa. IX. The GOVERNMENT
shall be upon his shoulders; he shall be
called the PRINCE of Peace: Of
the increase of his GOVERNMENT
and Peace there shall be no end: Vpon
the THRONE of <hi>David,</hi> and upon his
KINGDOM, to order it, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
it with Iudgment, and with Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
from henceforth even for ever.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60354:32"/>
               <hi>Micah</hi> V. 2. But thou, <hi>Bethlehem E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phratah,</hi>
though thou be little among
the thousands of <hi>Judah,</hi> yet out of thee
shall He come forth unto me, that is to
be the RVLER in Israel. <hi>And</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,
<hi>besides that he calls him</hi> Messiah
the PRINCE, Chap. IX. 25. <hi>In the
account of his Vision</hi> of the Son of Man,
Chap. VII. 13, 14. says, There was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him Dominion, Glory, and a KING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOM,
that all People, Nations, and
Languages should serve him: His Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
is an everlasting Dominion which
shall not pass away; and his KING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOM
that which shall not be destroyed.
<hi>So that the Kingdom of God, and the
Kingdom of Heaven, were common
Phrases amongst the Jews, to signifie
the times of the</hi> Messiah. <hi>Luke XIV.
15.</hi> One of the Jews that sat at meat
with him, said unto him, Blessed is he
that shall eat bread in the Kingdom of
God. Chap. <hi>XVII. 20. The Pharisees
demanded,</hi> When the Kingdom of God
should come? <hi>And St.</hi> Iohn Baptist came,
saying, Repent, for the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is at hand: <hi>A Phrase he would not
have used in Preaching, had it not been
understood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:60354:32"/>
There are other Expressions that sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and his Coming;
which we shall take notice of as they
come in our way.</p>
            <p>3. By plain and direct words, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the Doctrine of the <hi>Messiah;</hi>
speaking out that Jesus was He: As we
see the Apostles did, when they went
about Preaching the Gospel, after our
Saviour's Resurrection. This was the
open clear way, and that which one
would think the <hi>Messiah</hi> himself, when
he came, should have taken; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if it were of that moment, that
upon mens believing him to be the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> depended the forgiveness of
their sins. And yet we see that our
Saviour did not: But on the contrary,
for the most part, made no other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of himself, at least in <hi>Iudea,</hi>
and at the beginning of his Ministry,
but in the two former ways, which
were more obscure; Not declaring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> any otherwise
than as it might be gathered from the
Miracles he did, and the conformity
of his Life and Actions with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies
of the Old Testament concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him; and from some general dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60354:33"/>
of the Kingdom of the <hi>Messiah</hi>
being come, under the name of the
<hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> and <hi>of Heaven.</hi> Nay,
so far was he from publickly owning
himself to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
the doing of it: <hi>Mark</hi> VIII. 27-30.
<hi>He asked his Disciples, whom do men
say that I am? And they answered,</hi>
John the Baptist; <hi>but some say,</hi> Elias;
<hi>and others, one of the Prophets.</hi> (So that
it is evident, that even those who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
him an extraordinary Person,
knew not yet who he was, or that he
gave himself out for the <hi>Messiah;</hi> though
this was in the third Year of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
and not a year before his Death.)
<hi>And he saith unto them, but whom say
ye that I am? And</hi> Peter <hi>answered, and
said unto him, Thou art the</hi> Messiah.
<hi>And he charged them that they should
tell no man of him.</hi> Luke IV. 41. <hi>And
Devils came out of many, crying,
Thou art the</hi> Messiah, <hi>the Son of God:
And he rebuking them, suffered them
not to speak, that they knew him to be
the</hi> Messiah. <hi>Mark</hi> III. 11, 12. <hi>Unclean
spirits, when they saw him, fell down
before him, and cryed, saying, Thou art
the Son of God: And he straitly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60354:33"/>
them that they should not make him
known.</hi> Here again we may observe
from the comparing of the two Texts,
that <hi>Thou art the Son of God;</hi> or, <hi>Thou
art the Messiah;</hi> were indifferently used
for the same thing. But to return to
the matter in hand.</p>
            <p>This concealment of himself will
seem strange, in one who was come to
bring Light into the World, and was
to suffer Death for the Testimony of
the Truth. This reservedness will be
thought to look as if he had a mind
to conceal himself, and not to be known
to the World for the <hi>Messiah;</hi> nor to
be believed on as such. But we shall
be of another mind, and conclude this
proceeding of his according to Divine
Wisdom, and suited to a fuller Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation
and Evidence of his being the
<hi>Messiah;</hi> When we consider, that he was
to fill out the time foretold of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry;
And, after a Life illustrious in
Miracles and Good Works, attended
with Humility, Meekness, Patience,
and Suffering, and every way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to the Prophesies of him,
should be lead as a sheep to the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and with all quiet and submission be
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60354:34"/>
brought to the Cross, though there
were no guilt nor fault found in him.
This could not have been, if as soon
as he appeared in Publick, and began to
Preach, he had presently professed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to have been the <hi>Messiah;</hi> the King
that owned that Kingdom he published
to be at hand. For the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> would
then have laid hold on it, to have got
him into their Power, and thereby have
taken away his Life; at least, they would
have disturbed his Ministry, and
hindred the Work he was about. That
this made him cautious, and avoid, as
much as he could, the occasions of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
them, and falling into their
hands, is plain from <hi>Iohn</hi> VII. 1. <hi>After
these things Iesus walked in Galilee;</hi> out
of the way of the Chief Priests and
Rulers; <hi>for he would not walk in Iewry,
because the Iews sought to kill him.</hi>
Thus, making good what he foretold
them at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> when at the first
Passover after his beginning to Preach
the Gospel, upon his Curing the man
at the Pool of <hi>Bethesday,</hi> they sought
to kill him, <hi>Iohn</hi> V. 16. <hi>Ye have not,</hi>
says he, v. 38. <hi>his word abiding amongst
you: For whom he hath sent, him ye
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60354:34"/>
believe not.</hi> This was spoken more
particularly to the Jews of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
who were the forward men, zealous
to take away his Life: And it imports,
that because of their Unbelief and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to him, the <hi>Word of God, i. e.</hi>
the Preaching of the Kingdom of the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> which is often called the Word
of God, did not stay amongst them:
He could not stay amongst them,
Preach and explain to them the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Word of God, here, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<hi>the Word of God</hi> that should make
Jesus known to them to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
is evident from the Context: And this
meaning of this place is made good by
the event. For after this, we hear no
more of Jesus at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> till the
Pentecost come twelve month; though
'tis not to be doubted but that he was
there the next Passover, and other
Feasts between, but privately. And
now at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> at the Feast of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecost,</hi>
near fifteen Months after, he says
very little, and not a word of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven being come, or at
hand; nor did he any Miracle there.
And returning to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> at the Feast
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60354:35"/>
of Tabernacles, it is plain, that from
this time till then, which was a Year
and a half, he had not Taught them
at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, 1. It is said, <hi>Iohn</hi> VII. 2. 15.
That he teaching in the Temple at the
Feast of Tabernacles, <hi>The Iews mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled,
saying, How knoweth this man
letters, having never learned?</hi> A sign
they had not been used to his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
For if they had, they would not
now have marvelled.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Ver.</hi> 19. He says thus to them:
<hi>Did not</hi> Moses <hi>give you the Law, and
yet none of you keep the Law? Why go
you about to kill me? One work, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
I did</hi> here amongst you, <hi>and ye
all marvel.</hi> Moses <hi>therefore gave unto
you Circumcision, and ye on the Sabbath-day
circumcise a man: If a man on the
Sabbath-day receive Circumcision, that
the Law of</hi> Moses <hi>should not be broken,
are ye angry with me, because I have
made a man every way whole on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day?</hi>
Which is a direct defence of
what he did at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> a Year and a
half before, when he last preached to
them there; which is reported, <hi>Iohn</hi> V.
1-16. And it is at that very time
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60354:35"/>
when he told them <hi>v. 38. Ye have not
the Word of God remaining among you,
because whom he hath sent ye believe
not.</hi> Whereby, I think, he signifies
his not staying and being frequent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, Preaching the Gospel of
the Kingdom; because their great Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,
Opposition, and Malice to him
would not permit his stay and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
amongst them.</p>
            <p>This was manifestly so in fact. For
the first Miracle he did at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
which was at the second Passover after
his Baptism, brought him in danger of
his Life; Which made him forbear
Preaching again there till the Feast of
Tabernacles, immediately preceding
his last Passover: So that till half a
Year before his Passion, he did but one
Miracle, and preached but once pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly,
at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> These Tryals he
made there: But found their unbelief
such, that if he had staid and persisted
to Preach the good tidings of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and to shew himself by Miracles
among them, he could not have had
time and freedom to do those Works
which his Father had given him to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,
as he says, <hi>v.</hi> 36. of this fifth of
St. <hi>Iohn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:60354:36"/>
               <hi>When upon the curing of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
Hand on the Sabbath-day,</hi> The
<hi>Pharisees</hi> took Counsel with the <hi>Herodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
how they might destroy him; Iesus
withdrew himself with his Disciples to
the Sea: And a great multitude from
Galilee followed him, and from <hi>Judea,</hi>
and from Ierusalem, and from <hi>Idumea,</hi>
and from beyond <hi>Jordan,</hi> and they about
<hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> A great multitude;
when they had heard what great things
he did, came unto him, and he healed
them all, and CHARGED THEM
THAT THEY SHOVLD NOT
MAKE HIM KNOWN: That it
might be fulfilled what was spoken by the
Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> saying: Behold my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
whom I have chosen; my beloved,
in whom my soul is well pleased: I will
put my spirit upon him, and he shall
shew Iudgment to the Gentiles. He shall
not strive, nor cry, neither shall any man
hear his voice in the streets, Mat. <hi>XII.
and</hi> Mark <hi>III.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Iohn</hi> XI. 47. Upon the News
of our Saviour's raising <hi>Lazarus</hi> from
the Dead, <hi>The Chief Priests and</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees
<hi>convened the</hi> Sanhedrim, <hi>and said,
what do we? For this man does many
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60354:36"/>
Miracles. v. 53. Then from that day
forth they took counsel together for to
put him to death.</hi> v. 54. <hi>Iesus therefore
walked no more openly amongst the Iews.</hi>
His Miracles had now so much declared
him to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> that the Jews
could no longer bear him, nor he trust
himself amongst them; <hi>But went thence
unto a Country near to the Wilderness,
into a City called</hi> Ephraim, <hi>and there
continued with his Disciples.</hi> This was
but a little before his last Passover, as
appears by the following words, <hi>v. 55.
And the Iews Passover was nigh at hand:</hi>
And he could not, now his Miracles
had made him so well known, have
been secure the little time that now
remained till his hour was fully come;
if he had not with his wonted and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
caution withdrawn, <hi>And walked
no more openly amongst the Iews,</hi> till his
time (at the next Passover) was fully
come; And then again he appeared
amongst them openly.</p>
            <p>Nor would the <hi>Romans</hi> have suffered
him, if he had gone about Preaching
that he was the King whom the Jews
expected. Such an Accusation would
have been forwardly brought against
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60354:37"/>
him by the Jews, if they could have
heard it out of his own mouth; And
That had been his Publick Doctrine to
his followers, Which was openly prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
by the Apostles after his Death,
when he appeared no more. And of
this they were accused, <hi>Acts</hi> XVII. 5-9.
<hi>But the Iews which believed not, moved
with envy, took unto them certain lewd
fellows of the baser sort, and gathered
a company, and set all the City in an
uproar; And assaulted the House of</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<hi>and sought to bring them out to
the people. And when they found them</hi>
[Paul and Silas] <hi>not, they drew</hi> Jason
<hi>and certain brethren unto the Rulers of
the City, crying, these that have turned
the World upside down, are come hither
also, whom</hi> Jason <hi>hath received: And
these all do contrary to the decrees of</hi>
Caefar, <hi>saying, that there is another
King, one Iesus. And they troubled
the People and the Rulers of the City,
when they heard these things: And when
they had taken Security of</hi> Jason <hi>and
the other, they let them go.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though the Magistrates of the
World had no great regard to the talk
of a King, who had suffered Death,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60354:37"/>
and appeared no longer any where;
Yet if our Saviour had openly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
this of himself in his Life-time,
with a train of Disciples and Followers
every where owning and crying him
up for their King, the <hi>Roman</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Iudea</hi> could not have forborn
to have taken notice of it, and have
made use of their Force against him.
This the Jews were not mistaken in;
and therefore made use of it as the
strongest Accusation, and likeliest to
prevail with <hi>Pilate</hi> against him for the
taking away his Life; It being Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and an unpardonable Offence,
which could not scape Death from a
<hi>Roman</hi> Deputy, without the Forfeiture
of his own Life. Thus then they Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
him to <hi>Pilate, Luke</hi> XXIII. 2. <hi>We
found this fellow perverting the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and forbidding to give Tribute to</hi>
Caesar, <hi>saying, that he himself is the
Messiah, a King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Saviour indeed, now that his
time was come, (and he in Custody,
and forsaken of all the World, and so
out of all danger of raising any Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Disturbance,) owns himself, to
<hi>Pilate,</hi> to be a King; after having first
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60354:38"/>
told <hi>Pilate, Iohn</hi> XVIII. 36. <hi>That his
Kingdom was not of this World:</hi> And
for a Kingdom in another World, <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>
knew that his Master at <hi>Rome</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
not himself. But had there
been any the least appearance of truth
in the Allegations of the Jews, that
he had perverted the Nation; forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to pay Tribute to <hi>Caesar,</hi> or draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the People after him, as their King;
<hi>Pilate</hi> would not so readily have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
him Innocent. But we see
what he said to his Accusers, <hi>Luke</hi> XXIII.
13, 14. <hi>Pilate, when he had called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
the Chief Priests and the Rulers
of the People, said unto them, You have
brought this man unto me, as one that
perverteth the People; and behold, I
having examined him before you, have
found no fault in this man, touching those
things whereof you accuse him: No, nor
yet</hi> Herod, <hi>for I sent you to him; and
lo, nothing worthy of death is done by
him.</hi> And therefore finding a man of
that mean Condition, and innocent
Life, (no mover of Seditions, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturber
of the Publick Peace,) without
a Friend or a Follower; would have
dismissed him, as a King of no conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60354:38"/>
as an innocent man, falsely
and maliciously accused by the Jews.</p>
            <p>How necessary this Caution was in
our Saviour, to say or do nothing that
might justly offend, or render him su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
to the <hi>Roman</hi> Governour; and
how glad the Jews would have been
to have any such thing against him;
we may see, <hi>Luke</hi> XX. 20. The Chief
Priests and the Scribes <hi>watched him,
and sent forth spies, who should feign
themselves just men, that might take hold
of his words, that so they might deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
him unto the Power and Authority
of the Governour.</hi> And the very thing
wherein they hoped to entrap him in
this place, was paying Tribute to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi>
which they afterwards falsely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
him of. And what would they
have done, if he had before them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
himself to have been the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
their King and Deliverer?</p>
            <p>And here we may observe the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Providence of God, who had so
ordered the state of the Jews at the
time when his Son was to come into
the World; that though neither their
Civil Constitution, nor Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
were dissolved, yet the Power of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60354:39"/>
Life and Death was taken from them;
Whereby he had an Opportunity to
publish the Kingdom of the <hi>Messiah;</hi>
that is, his own Royalty, under the
name of the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> and <hi>of
Heaven:</hi> Which the Jews well enough
understood, and would certainly have
put him to Death for, had the Power
been in their own hands. But this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no matter of Accusation to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
hindred him not from speaking
of the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> as he did:
Sometimes in reference to his appearing
in the World, and being believed on
by particular Persons; Sometimes in
reference to the Power should be given
him by the Father at his Resurrection;
And sometimes in reference to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Judge the World at the last day
in the full Glory and completion of his
Kingdom. These were ways of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
himself, which the Jews could
lay no hold on, to bring him in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
with <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and get him
seized and put to Death.</p>
            <p>Another Reason there was, that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
him as much as the former from
professing himself in express words to
be the <hi>Messiah;</hi> and that was, that the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60354:39"/>
whole Nation of the Jews expecting at
this time their <hi>Messiah,</hi> and deliverance
by him from the Subjection they were
in to a Foreign Yoke, the body of the
People would certainly upon his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
himself to be the <hi>Messiah</hi> their
King, have rose up in Rebellion, and
set him at the Head of them. And
indeed, the miracles that he did so
much disposed them to think him to
be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> that though shrouded
under the obscurity of a mean Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and a very private simple Life,
and his passing for a <hi>Galilean,</hi> (his Birth
at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> being then concealed) and
he not assuming to himself any Power
or Authority, or so much as the Name
of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> yet he could hardly
avoid being set up by a Tumult, and
proclaimed their King. So <hi>Iohn</hi> tells
us, <hi>Chap.</hi> V. 14, 15. <hi>Then those men,
when they had seen the Miracles that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
did, said, This is of a truth that
Prophet that should come into the World.
When therefore Iesus perceived that
they would come to take him by force to
make him King, he departed again into
a Mountain himself alone.</hi> This was
upon his feeding of Five Thousand
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60354:40"/>
with five Barley Loaves and two Fishes.
So hard was it for him, doing those
miracles which were necessary to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
his Mission, and which often drew
great multitudes after him, <hi>Mat.</hi> IV.
25. to keep the heady and hasty mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
from such Disorder, as would
have involved him in it; and have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed
the course, and cut short the
time of his Ministry; and drawn on
him the Reputation and Death of a
Turbulent Seditious Malefactor: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the design of his coming,
which was to be offered up a Lamb
blameless, and void of Offence; his
Innocence appearing to all the World,
even to him that delivered him up to
be crucified. This it would have been
impossible to have avoided, if in his
Preaching every where, he had openly
assumed to himself the Title of their
<hi>Messiah;</hi> Which was all was wanting to
set the People in a flame; who, drawn
by his miracles, and the hopes of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Deliverer in so extraordinary a
man, followed him in great numbers.
We read every where of multitudes;
And in <hi>Luke</hi> XII. 1. of <hi>Myriads</hi> that
were gathered about him. This conflux
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60354:40"/>
of People, thus disposed, would not
have failed, upon his declaring himself
to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> to have made a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion,
and with Force set him up for
their King. It is plain therefore from
these these two Reasons, why, (though
he came to Preach the Gospel, and
Convert the World to a belief of his
being the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and though he says
so much of his Kingdom, under the
Title of the Kingdom of God, and
the Kingdom of Heaven,) he yet makes
it not his business to perswade them
that he himself is the <hi>Messiah,</hi> or does
in his Publick Preaching declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be him. He inculcates to the
People, on all occasions, that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God is come. He shews the
way of Admittance into this Kingdom,
<hi>viz.</hi> Repentance and Baptism; and
teaches the Laws of it, <hi>viz.</hi> Good
Life, according to the strictest Rules
of Vertue and Morality. But who the
King was of this Kingdom, he leaves
to his miracles to point out to those
who would consider what he did, and
make the right use of it, now; Or to
witness to those who should hearken
to the Apostles hereafter; when they
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60354:41"/>
preached it in plain words, and called
upon them to believe it, after his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
when there should be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
any fear that it should cause any
disturbance in Civil Societies and the
Governments of the World. But he
could not declare himself to be the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> without manifest danger of
Tumult and Sedition. And the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
he did, declared it so much, that
he was fain often to hide himself, and
withdraw from the concourse of the
People. The Leper that he cured,
<hi>Mark</hi> I. though forbid to say any thing,
yet <hi>blazed it so abroad, that Iesus could
no more openly enter into the City, but
was without in desart places;</hi> And there
<hi>they came to him from every quarter.</hi>
And thus he did more than once.</p>
            <p>This being premised, let us take a
view of the Promulgation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
by our Saviour himself, and see
what it was he taught the World, and
required men to believe.</p>
            <p>The first beginning of his Ministry,
whereby he shewed himself, seems to
be at <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galilee,</hi> soon after his
Baptism; where he turned Water into
Wine: Of which St. <hi>Iohn, Chap.</hi> II. 11.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60354:41"/>
says thus, <hi>This beginning of Miracles
Iesus made, and manifested his glory,
and his Disciples believed in him.</hi> His
Disciples here believed in him, but we
hear not of any other Preaching to
them, but by this Miracle, whereby
he <hi>manifested his Glory; i. e.</hi> of being
the <hi>Messiah</hi> the Prince. So <hi>Nathanael,</hi>
without any other Preaching, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
our Saviour's discovering to him
that he knew him after an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
manner, presently acknowledges
him to be the <hi>Messiah;</hi> crying, <hi>Rabbi,
Thou art the Son of God; Thou art the
King of Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence, staying a few days at
<hi>Capernaum,</hi> he goes to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to the
Passover; and there he drives the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
out of the Temple, <hi>Iohn</hi> II. 12-15.
saying, <hi>Make not my Father's House a
House of merchandize.</hi> Where we see,
he uses a Phrase, which by Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
signifies that he was the <hi>Son of
God,</hi> though at that time unregarded.
<hi>v.</hi> 16. Hereupon the Jews demand,
<hi>What sign dost thou shew us, since thou
doest these things? Iesus answered, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
ye this Temple, and in three days
I will raise it again.</hi> This is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60354:42"/>
of what way Jesus took to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
himself: For 'tis plain by their
Reply, the Jews understood him not,
nor his Disciples neither; For 'tis said,
<hi>v. 22. When therefore he was risen from
the dead, his Disciples remembred that
he said this to them: And they believed
the Scripture, and the saying of Iesus
to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This therefore we may look on, in
the beginning, as a Pattern of Christ's
Preaching, and shewing himself to the
Jews; Which he generally followed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
<hi>viz.</hi> such a manifestation of
himself, as every one at present could
not understand; but yet carried such
an Evidence with it to those who were
well disposed now, or would reflect on
it when the whole course of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
was over, as was sufficient clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to convince them that he was the
<hi>Messiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reason of this method used by
our Saviour, the Scripture gives us
here, at this his first appearing in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
after his entrance upon his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry;
to be a Rule and Light to us
in the whole course of it. For the
next Verse taking notice that many
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60354:42"/>
believed on him, <hi>because of his Miracles,</hi>
(which was all the Preaching they had.)
'Tis said, <hi>v. 24. But Iesus did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
himself unto them, because he knew
all men; i. e.</hi>
He declared not himself
so openly to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> their King,
as to put himself into the Power of the
Jews, by laying himself open to their
malice; whom he knew would be so
ready to lay hold on it to accuse him.
For, as the next Verse 25. shews, he
knew well enough what was in them.
We may here farther observe, That
<hi>Believing in his Name,</hi> signifies belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him to be the <hi>Messiah. V.</hi> 22. tells
us, That <hi>many at the Passover believed
in his name, when they saw the Miracles
that he did.</hi> What other Faith could
these Miracles produce in them, who
saw them, but that this was He, of
whom the Scripture spoke, who was to
be their Deliverer?</p>
            <p>Whilst he was now at <hi>Ierusalem,
Nicodemus,</hi> a Ruler of the Jews, comes
to him, <hi>Iohn</hi> III. 1-21. to whom he
Preaches Eternal Life by Faith in the
<hi>Messiah, v.</hi> 15. &amp; 17. But in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
terms, without naming himself
to be that <hi>Messiah;</hi> though his whole
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60354:43"/>
Discourse tends to it. This is all we
hear of our Saviour the first Year of
his Ministry; But only his Baptism, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,
and Temptation in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it; and spending the rest of it
after the Passover in <hi>Iudea</hi> with his
Disciples, Baptizing there. but <hi>when
he knew that the</hi> Pharisees <hi>reported that
he made and baptized more Disciples
than</hi> John, <hi>he left</hi> Judea, and got out
of their way again into <hi>Galilee,</hi> John IV.
1. 3.</p>
            <p>In his way back, by the Well of
<hi>Sichar,</hi> he discourses with the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
Woman; And after having opened
to her the True and Spiritual Worship
which was at hand, which the Woman
presently understands of the times of
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> who was then looked for;
Thus she answers, <hi>v. 25. I know that
the Messiah cometh: When he is come, he
will tell us all things.</hi> Whereupon our
Saviour, though we hear no such thing
from him in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> or <hi>Iudea,</hi> or to
<hi>Nicodemus,</hi> yet here to this <hi>Samaritan</hi>
Woman, he in plain and direct words
owns and declares, that he himself,
who talked with her, was the <hi>Messiah,
v.</hi> 26.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:60354:43"/>
This would seem very strange, that
he should be more free and open to a
<hi>Samaritan,</hi> than he was to the Jews;
were not the reason plain from what
we have observed above. He was now
out of <hi>Iudea,</hi> with a People with whom
the <hi>Iews</hi> had no Commerce; <hi>v.</hi> 9. Who
were not disposed out of Envy, as the
<hi>Iews</hi> were, to seek his Life, or to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
him to the <hi>Roman</hi> Governour, or
to make an Insurrection to set a <hi>Iew</hi>
up for their King. What the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
was of his Discourse with this
<hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman, we have an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>v.</hi> 28. 39-42. <hi>She left her Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-pot,
and went her way into the City,
and saith to the men, Come, see a man
who told me all things that ever I did:
Is not this the Messiah? And many of
the</hi> Samaritans <hi>of that City BELIE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VED
ON HIM for the saying of the
Woman, which testified, He told me all
that ever I did. So when the</hi> Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
<hi>were come unto him, they besought
him that he would tarry with them: And
he abode there two days. And many
more believed because of his own word:
And said unto the Woman, Now we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
not because of thy saying; For we
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60354:44"/>
have heard him our selves; and we know,
(i. e.</hi> are fully perswaded,) <hi>that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Messiah, the Saviour of the
World.</hi> By comparing <hi>v.</hi> 39. with 41
&amp; 42. it is plain, that <hi>believing on him</hi>
signifies no more than believing him
to be the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Sichar</hi> Jesus goes to <hi>Nazareth,</hi>
the place he was bred up in; and there
Reading in the Synagogue a Prophecy
concerning the <hi>Messiah</hi> out of the LXI
of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> he tells them, <hi>Luke</hi> IV. 21.
<hi>This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your
ears.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But being in danger of his Life at
<hi>Nazareth,</hi> he leaves it, for <hi>Capernaum:</hi>
And then, as St. <hi>Matthew</hi> informs us,
<hi>Chap.</hi> IV. 17. <hi>He began to Preach, and
say, Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven
is at hand.</hi> Or, as St. <hi>Mark</hi> has it,
<hi>Chap.</hi> I. 14, 15. <hi>Preaching the Gospel
of the Kingdom of God; and saying, The
time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God
is at hand, repent ye, and believe in
the Gospel; i. e.</hi> believe this good News.
This removing to <hi>Capernaum,</hi> and seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself there in the Borders of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulon</hi>
and <hi>Naphtali,</hi> was, as St. <hi>Matthew</hi>
observes, <hi>Chap.</hi> IV. 13-16. That a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60354:44"/>
Prophecy of <hi>Isaiah</hi> might be fulfilled.
Thus the Actions and Circumstances of
his Life answered the Prophesies, and
declared him to be the <hi>Messiah.</hi> And
by what St. <hi>Mark</hi> says in this place, it
is manifest, that the Gospel which he
preached and required them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
was no other but the good ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of the Coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
and of his Kingdom; the time being
now fulfilled.</p>
            <p>In his way to <hi>Capernaum,</hi> being come
to <hi>Cana,</hi> a Noble-man of <hi>Capernaum</hi>
came to him, <hi>v. 47. And besought him
that he would come down and heal his
Son, for he was at the point of death.</hi>
v. 48. <hi>Then said Iesus unto him, except
ye see signs and wonders, you will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi>
Then he returning homewards,
and finding that his Son began to <hi>mend
at the same hour in which Iesus said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, thy Son liveth; he himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
and his whole House,</hi> v. 53.</p>
            <p>Here this Noble-man is by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
pronounced to be a <hi>Believer.</hi> And
what does he <hi>believe?</hi> Even that which
Jesus complains, <hi>v. 48. They would not
BELIEVE,</hi> except they saw Signs
and Wonders: Which could be nothing
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60354:45"/>
but what those of <hi>Samaria,</hi> in the same
Chapter, believed; <hi>viz.</hi> that he was the
<hi>Messiah.</hi> For we no where in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
hear of any thing else had been
proposed to be believed by them.</p>
            <p>Having done Miracles, and cured all
their sick at <hi>Capernaum,</hi> he says, <hi>Let
us go to the adjoyning Towns, that I may
preach there also; for therefore came I
forth, Mark</hi> I. 38. Or, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> has
it, <hi>Chap.</hi> IV. 43. He tells the multitude,
who would have kept him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he
might not go from them, <hi>I must Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelize,</hi>
or tell the good Tidings of the
<hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> to other Cities also;
for therefore am I sent. And St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,
Chap.</hi> IV. 23. tells us how he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
this Commission he was sent on.
<hi>And Iesus went about all</hi> Galilee, <hi>teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in their Synagogues, and preaching
the Gospel of the Kingdom, and curing
all Diseases.</hi> This then was what he
was sent to Preach every where, <hi>viz.</hi>
The Gospel of the Kingdom of the
<hi>Messiah;</hi> and by the Miracles and Good
he did, let them know who was the
<hi>Messiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence he goes up to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to
the second Passover since the beginning
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60354:45"/>
of his Ministry. And here discoursing
to the Jews, who sought to kill him,
upon occasion of the man, whom he
had cured, carrying his Bed on the
Sabbath-day; and for making God his
Father; He tells them, that he wrought
these things by the Power of God;
and that he shall do greater things: For
that the Dead shall, at his Summons, be
raised; And that he, by a Power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to him from his Father, shall
Judge them; And that he is sent by
his Father; And that whoever shall
hear his Word, and believe in him that
sent him, has Eternal Life. This,
though a clear Description of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi>
yet we may observe, that here to
the angry <hi>Iews,</hi> who sought to kill
him, he says not a word of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
nor so much as names the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah;</hi>
But yet that he is the Son of
God, and sent from God, He refers
them to the Testimony of <hi>Iohn</hi> the
<hi>Baptist,</hi> to the Testimony of his own
Miracles, and of God himself in the
Voice from Heaven; and of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and of <hi>Moses.</hi> He leaves them
to learn from these the Truth they
were to believe, <hi>viz.</hi> that he was the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60354:46"/>
               <hi>Messiah</hi> sent from God. This you may
read more at large, <hi>Iohn</hi> V. 1-47.</p>
            <p>The next place where we find him
Preaching, was on the Mount, <hi>Mat.</hi> V.
and <hi>Luke</hi> VI. This is by much the
longest Sermon we have of his any
where; and, in all likelihood, to the
greatest Auditory. For it appears to
have been to the Peple gathered to him
from <hi>Galilee,</hi> and <hi>Iudea,</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
and from beyond <hi>Iordan;</hi> and that
came out of <hi>Idumea,</hi> and from <hi>Tyre</hi>
and <hi>Sidon;</hi> mentioned <hi>Mark</hi> III. 7, 8.
and <hi>Luke</hi> VI. 17. But in this whole
Sermon of his we do not find one
word of Believing, and therefore no
mention of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> or any intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the People who himself was.
The reason whereof we may gather
from <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 16. where Christ <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
them to make him known;</hi> which
supposes them to know already who
he was. For that this XII. Chapter of
<hi>Matthew</hi> ought to precede the Sermon
in the Mount, is plain, by comparing
it with <hi>Mark</hi> II. beginning at <hi>v.</hi> 13. to
<hi>Mark</hi> III. 8. And comparing those
Chapters of St. <hi>Mark</hi> with <hi>Luke</hi> VI.
And I desire my Reader once for all
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60354:46"/>
here to take notice, that I have all
along observed the order of time in
our Saviour's Proaching; and have not,
as I think, passed by any of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses.
In this Sermon our Saviour
only teaches them what were the Laws
of his Kingdom, and what they must
do who were admitted into it, of which
I shall have occasion to speak more at
large in another place; being at present
only enquiring what our Saviour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
as matter of Faith to be believed.</p>
            <p>After this, <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> sends to
him this Message, <hi>Luke</hi> VII. 19. Ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Art thou he that should come, or
do we expect another?</hi> That is, in short,
art thou the <hi>Messiah?</hi> And if thou art,
why dost thou let me, thy Fore runner,
languish in Prison? Must I expect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
from any other? To which
Jesus returns this Answer, <hi>v.</hi> 22, 23.
<hi>Tell</hi> John <hi>what you have seen and heard:
The Blind see, the Lame walk, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
are cleansed, the Deaf hear, the
Dead are raised, to the Poor the Gospel
is preached; and blessed is he who is not
offended in me.</hi> What it is to be <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended</hi>
or <hi>scandalized in him,</hi> we may
see by comparing <hi>Mat.</hi> XIII. 28. and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60354:47"/>
               <hi>Mark</hi> IV. 17. with <hi>Luke</hi> VIII. 13. For
what the two first call <hi>scandalized,</hi>
the last calls <hi>standing off from,</hi> or
<hi>forsaking; i. e.</hi> not receiving him as
the <hi>Messiah; (Vid. Mark</hi> VI. 1-6.)
or revolting from him. Here Jesus
refers <hi>Iohn,</hi> as he did the Jews before,
to the Testimony of his Miracles, to
know who he was; And this was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
his Preaching, whereby he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
himself to be the <hi>Messiah:</hi> Who
was the only Prophet to come, whom
the <hi>Iews</hi> had any expectation of; Nor
did they look for any other Person to
be sent to them with the Power of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
but only the <hi>Messiah.</hi> His Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
we see by his Answer to <hi>Iohn</hi>
the <hi>Baptist,</hi> he thought a sufficient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
amongst them, that he was
the <hi>Messiah.</hi> And therefore, upon his
curing the possessed of the Devil, the
Dumb, and Blind, <hi>Mat.</hi> XII. the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who saw the Miracle, said, <hi>v.</hi> 23.
<hi>Is not this the Son of David?</hi> As much
as to say, Is not this the <hi>Messiah?</hi>
Whereat the <hi>Pharisees</hi> being offended,
said, He cast out Devils by <hi>Beelzebub.</hi>
Jesus shewing the falshood and vanity
of their Blasphemy, justifies the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60354:47"/>
the People made from this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle;
saying, <hi>v.</hi> 28. That his casting
out Devils by the Spirit of God, was
an Evidence that the Kingdom of the
<hi>Messiah</hi> was come.</p>
            <p>One thing more there was in the
Miracles done by his Disciples, which
shewed him to be the <hi>Messiah;</hi> That
they were done in his Name. <hi>In the
name of Iesus of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>rise up and
walk,</hi> says St. <hi>Peter</hi> to the lame man
whom he cured in the Temple, <hi>Acts</hi> III.
6. And how far the Power of that
Name reached, they themselves seem
to wonder, <hi>Luke</hi> X. 17. <hi>And the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
returned again with joy, saying,
Lord, even the Devils are subject to us
in thy Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this Message from <hi>Iohn</hi> the
<hi>Baptist,</hi> he takes occasion to tell the
People, that <hi>Iohn</hi> was the Fore-runner
of the <hi>Messiah;</hi> That from the time of
<hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> the Kingdom of the
<hi>Messiah</hi> began; To which time all the
Prophets and the Law pointed, <hi>Luke</hi> VII.
and <hi>Mat.</hi> XI.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luke</hi> VIII. 1. <hi>Afterwards he went
through every City and Village, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and shewing the good tidings of the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60354:48"/>
Kingdom of God.</hi> Here we see, as every
where, what his Preaching was; and
consequently what was to be believed.</p>
            <p>Soon after, he Preaches from a Boat
to the People on the shoar. His Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
at large we may read, <hi>Mat.</hi> XIII.
<hi>Mark</hi> IV. and <hi>Luke</hi> VIII. But this is
very observeable, That this second Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
of his here, is quite different from
his former in the Mount. For that
was all so plain and intelligible, that
nothing could be more so: Whereas
this is all so involved in Parables, that
even the Apostles themselves did not
understand it. If we enquire into the
reason of this, we shall possibly have
some Light from the different Subjects
of these two Sermons. There he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
to the People only Morality;
Clearing the Precepts of the Law from
the false glosses which were received in
those days; And setting forth the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of a good Life in their full Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Extent, beyond what the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary
Laws of the <hi>Israelites</hi> did, or
the Civil Laws of any Country could
prescribe or take notice of. But here
in this Sermon by the Sea-side, he
speaks of nothing but the Kingdom of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60354:48"/>
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> which he does all in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables.
One Reason whereof St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
gives us, <hi>Chap.</hi> XIII. 35. <hi>That it
might be fulfilled which was spoken by
the Prophet, saying, I will open my mouth
in Parables, I will utter things that
have been keep secret from the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the World.</hi> Another reason
our Saviour himself gives of it, <hi>v.</hi> 11,
12. <hi>Because to you is given to know the
Mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven,
but to them it is not given. For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
hath, to him shall be given, and
he shall have more abundantly: But
whosoever hath not, i. e.</hi> improves not
the Talents that he hath, <hi>from him shall
be taken away, even that that he hath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One thing it may not be amiss to
observe; That our Saviour here in the
Explication of the first of these Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
to his Apostles, calls the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Kingdom of the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
simply <hi>the Word;</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi> VIII. 21.
<hi>The Word of God:</hi> From whence St.
<hi>Luke,</hi> in the <hi>Acts,</hi> often mentions it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the name of the <hi>Word,</hi> and the
<hi>Word of God,</hi> as we have elsewhere
observed. To which I shall here add
that of <hi>Acts</hi> VIII. 4. <hi>Therefore they that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60354:49"/>
were scattered abroad, went every where
preaching the Word:</hi> Which Word, as
we have found by examining what they
preached all through their History, was
nothing but this, That <hi>Iesus was the
Messiah:</hi> I mean, This was all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
they proposed to be believed. For
what they taught, as well as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
contained a great deal more;
but that concerned Practice, and not
Belief. And therefore our Saviour says,
in the place before quoted, <hi>Luke</hi> VIII.
21. <hi>They are my Mother, and my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
who hear the Word of God, and
do it:</hi> Obeying the Law of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi>
their King, being no less required
than their believing that Jesus was the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> the King and Deliverer that
was promised them.</p>
            <p>Mat. <hi>IX. 13. We have an Account,
again of this Preaching; what it was,
and how.</hi> And Iesus went about all
the Cities and Villages, teaching in their
Synagogues, and preaching the Gospel of
the Kingdom; and healing every Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and every Disease amongst the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<hi>He acquainted them that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the</hi> Messiah <hi>was come, and left
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60354:49"/>
it to his Miracles to instruct and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
them that he was the</hi> Messiah.</p>
            <p>Mat. <hi>X. When he sent his Apostles
abroad, their Commission to Preach
we have</hi> v. 7, 8. <hi>in these words:</hi> As
ye go, preach, saying, the Kingdom of
Heaven is at hand; Heal the sick, &amp;c.
<hi>All that they had to Preach, was, that
the Kingdom of the</hi> Messiah <hi>was come.
Whosoever should not receive them,
the Messengers of this good Tidings,
nor hearken to their Message, incurred

<hi>at the day of Judgment,</hi> v. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
15. <hi>But</hi> v. 32. Whosoever shall confess
me before men, I will confess him before
my Father who is in Heaven. <hi>What
this confessing of Christ is, we may
see, by comparing</hi> Iohn XII. 4. <hi>with</hi>
IX. 22. Nevertheless among the chief
Rulers also many believed in him; But
because of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> they did not
CONFESS HIM, lest they should be
put out of the Synagogue. <hi>And Chap.</hi>
IX. 22. These words spake his Parents,
because they feared the Iews: For the
Iews had agreed already, that if any
man did CONFESS THAT HE
WAS THE MESSIAH, he should
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60354:50"/>
be put out of the Synagogue. <hi>By which
places it is evident, that to</hi> confess <hi>him,
was to</hi> confess <hi>that he was the</hi> Messiah.
<hi>From which give me leave to observe
also (what I have cleared from other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but cannot be too often remark'd,
because of the different sense has been
put upon that Phrase;</hi>) viz. <hi>That</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
on or in him (<hi>for <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> is
rendred either way by the</hi> English
<hi>Traslation) signifies believing that he
was the</hi> Messiah. <hi>For many of</hi> the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
(<hi>the Text says</hi>) believed on him;
<hi>But they durst not consess what they
believed,</hi> for fear they should be put out
of the Synagogue. <hi>Now the Offence
for which it was agreed that any one
should be put out of the Synagogue,
was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he</hi> did confess that Iesus was the
Messiah. <hi>Hence we may have a clear
understanding of that passage of St.</hi> Paul
<hi>to the</hi> Romans, <hi>where he tells them po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively,
what is the Faith he Preaches;</hi>
Rom. X. 8, 9. That is the Word of Faith
which we preach; That if thou shalt
confess with thy mouth the Lord Iesus,
and believe in thine heart, that God hath
raised him from the dead, thou shalt be
saved: <hi>And that also of St.</hi> Iohn IV.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60354:50"/>
14, 15. We have seen, and do testifie,
that the Father sent the Son to be the
Saviour of the World: Whosoever shall
confess that Iesus is the Son of God, God
dwelleth in him, and be in God. <hi>Where
confessing Jesus to be the Son of God,
is the same with confessing him to be
the</hi> Messiah: <hi>Those two Expressions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
understood amongst the Jews to
signifie the same thing, as we have
shewn already.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How calling him the Son of God
came to signifie that he was the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
would not be hard to shew. But it is
enough that it appears plainly that it
was so used, and had that import a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Jews at that time; Which
if any one desires to have further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced
to him, he may add <hi>Mat.</hi> XXVI.
63. <hi>Iohn</hi> VI. 69. &amp; XI. 27. &amp; XX. 31.
to those places before occasionally ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of.</p>
            <p>As was the Apostles Commission,
such was their Performance; As we
read, <hi>Luke</hi> IX. 6. <hi>They departed, and
went through the Towns, preaching the
Gospel, and healing every where.</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
bid them Preach, <hi>saying, The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven is at hand.</hi> And St.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60354:51"/>
               <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, they went through the
Towns, Preaching the <hi>Gospel;</hi> A word
which in <hi>Saxon</hi> answers well the <hi>Greek</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and signifies, as that does,
<hi>Good news.</hi> So that what the inspired
Writers call the <hi>Gospel,</hi> is nothing but
the good Tidings that the <hi>Messiah</hi> and
his Kingdom was come; And so it is
to be understood in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
And so the Angel calls it <hi>Good
tidings of great joy, Luke</hi> II. 10. Bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the first News of our Saviour's Birth.
And this seems to be all that his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
were at that time sent to Preach.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Luke</hi> IX. 59, 60. To him that
would have excused his present Attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
because of burying his Father;
<hi>Iesus said unto him, let the dead bury
their dead, but go thou and preach the
Kingdom of God.</hi> When, I say, this
was all they were to Preach, I must be
understood, that this was the Faith
they preached; But with it they joyned
Obedience to the <hi>Messiah,</hi> whom they
received for their King. So likewise
when he sent out the Seventy, <hi>Luke</hi> X.
their Commission was in these words,
<hi>v. 9. Heal the sick, and say unto them,
the Kingdom of God is come nigh unto
you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:60354:51"/>
After the return of his Apostles to
him, he sits down with them in a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
And a great multitude being ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
about them, St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us,
<hi>Chap.</hi> IX. 11. <hi>The people followed him,
and he received them, and spake unto
them of the Kingdom of God; and healed
them that had need of healing.</hi> This
was his Preaching to this Assembly,
which consisted of Five Thousand Men,
besides Women and Children: All which
great multitude he fed with five Loaves
and two Fishes, <hi>Mat.</hi> XIV. 21. And
what this Miracle wrought upon them,
St. <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us, <hi>Chap.</hi> VI. 14, 15. <hi>Then
these men, when they had seen the miracle
that Iesus did, said, This is of a truth
that Prophet that should come into the
World; i. e.</hi> the <hi>Messiah.</hi> For the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi>
was the only Person that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from God, and this the time
they looked for him. And hence <hi>Iohn</hi>
the <hi>Baptist, Mat.</hi> XI. 3. stiles him, <hi>He
that should come;</hi> As in other places,
<hi>Come from God,</hi> or <hi>Sent from God,</hi> are
Phrases used for the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we see our Saviour keeps to his
usual method of Preaching: He speaks
to them of the Kingdom of God, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60354:52"/>
does Miracles; by which they might
understand him to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> whose
Kingdom he spake of. And here we
have the reason also, why he so much
concealed himself, and forbore to own
his being the <hi>Messiah.</hi> For what the
consequence was, of the multitudes
but thinking him so, when they were
got together, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us in the
very next words: <hi>When Iesus then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that they would come and take
him by force to make him a King, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
again into a mountain himself
alone.</hi> If they were so ready to set
him up for their King, only because
they gathered from his Miracles that
he was the <hi>Messiah,</hi> whilst he himself
said nothing of it; What would not
the People have done; And what would
not the Scribes and Pharisees have had
an Opportunity to Accuse him of; if
he had openly professed himself to have
been the <hi>Messiah,</hi> that King they looked
for? But this we have taken notice of
already.</p>
            <p>From hence going to <hi>Capernaum,</hi>
whither he was followed by a great
part of the People, whom he had the
day before so miraculously fed; He,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60354:52"/>
upon the occasion of their following
him for the Loaves, bids them seek for
the Meat that endureth to Eternal Life:
And thereupon, <hi>Iohn</hi> VI. 22-69. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
to them his being sent from the
Father; And that those who believed
in him, should be raised to Eternal Life:
But all this, very much involved in a
mixture of Allegorical terms of eating,
and of Bread, Bread of Life, which
came down from Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which
is all comprehended and expounded in
these short and plain words, <hi>v.</hi> 47. &amp;
54. <hi>Verily, verily I say unto you, he that
believeth on me, hath everlasting life and
I will raise him up at the last day.</hi> The
sum of all which Discourse is, that he
was the <hi>Messiah</hi> sent from God; And
that those who believed him to be so,
should be raised from the Dead at the
last day to Eternal Life. These who
he spoke to, were of those who the
day before would by force have made
him King; And therefore 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
he should speak to them of himself,
and his Kingdom and Subjects, in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
and Mystical terms; and such as
should offend those who looked for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Grandeur of a Temporal
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60354:53"/>
Kingdom in this World, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
and Prosperity they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
themselves under it. The hopes
of such a Kingdom, now that they had
found a man that did Miracles, and
therefore concluded to be the Deliverer
they expected, had the day before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
drawn them into an open Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and involved our Saviour in it.
This he thought fit to put a stop to;
they still following him 'tis like with
the same design. And therefore
though he here speaks to them of his
Kingdom, it was in a way that so
plainly bauk'd their Expectation; and
shock'd them; that when they found
themselves disappointed of those vain
hopes, and that he talked of their eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Flesh, and drinking his Blood,
that they might have Life; the Jews
said, <hi>v. 52. How can this man give us
his flesh to eat? And many, even of his
Disciples, said, It was an hard saying,
who can bear it?</hi> And so were scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
in him, and forsook him, <hi>v.</hi> 60.
66. But what the true meaning of
this Discourse of our Saviour was, the
Confession of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who understood
it better and answered for the rest of the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60354:53"/>
Apostles shews: When Jesus asked him,
<hi>v. 67. Will ye also go away? Then</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Peter <hi>answered him, Lord, to whom
shall we go? Thou hast the words of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life; i. e.</hi> Thou teachest us the way
to attain Eternal Life; And accordingly
<hi>We believe, and are sure that thou art
the Messiah, the Son of the living God.</hi>
This was the eating his Flesh, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Blood, whereby those who did
so had Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>Sometime after this, he enquires of
his Disciples, <hi>Mark</hi> VIII. 27. Who the
People took him for? They telling
him, for <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> or one of
the old Prophets risen from the Dead;
He asked, what they themselves thought?
And here again <hi>Peter</hi> answers in these
words, <hi>Mark</hi> VIII. 29. <hi>Thou art the
Messiah.</hi> Luke IX. 20. <hi>The Messiah of
God.</hi> And <hi>Mat.</hi> XVI. 16. <hi>Thou art the
Messiah, the Son of the living God:</hi>
Which Expressions, we may hence ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
amount to the same thing. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
our Saviour tells <hi>Peter, Mat.</hi> XVI.
17, 18. That this was such a truth
<hi>As flesh and blood could not reveal to
him, but only his Father who was in
Haven;</hi> And that this was the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60354:54"/>
on which he was <hi>to build his
Church.</hi> By all the parts of which
passage it is more than probable, that
he had never yet told his Apostles in
direct words that he was the <hi>Messiah;</hi>
but that they had gathered it from his
Life and Miracles. For which we may
imagine to our selves this probable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
Because that if he had familiarly,
and in direct terms, talked to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
in private that he was the <hi>Messiah</hi>
the Prince, of whose Kingdom he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
so much in publick every where;
<hi>Iudas,</hi> whom he knew false and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
would have been readily made
use of to testifie against him, in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that would have been really Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
to the <hi>Roman</hi> Governour. This
perhaps may help to clear to us that
seemingly abrupt reply of our Saviour
to his Apostles, <hi>Iohn</hi> VI. 70. when they
confessed him to be the <hi>Messiah.</hi> I will,
for the better explaining of it, set
down the passage at large. <hi>Peter</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
said, <hi>We believe, and are sure that
thou art the Messiah, the Son of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God. Iesus answered them, Have
not I chosen you twelve, and one of you
is</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>? This is a reply seeming
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60354:54"/>
at first sight nothing to the purpose;
when yet it is sure all our Saviour's Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
were wise and pertinent. It
seems therefore to me to carry this
sense, to be understood afterwards by
the eleven (as that of destroying the
Temple, and raising it again in three
days was) when they should reflect on
it after his being betray'd by <hi>Iudas:</hi>
You have confessed, and believe the
truth concerning me; I am the <hi>Messiah</hi>
your King: But do not wonder at it,
that I have never openly declared it to
you: For amongst you twelve, whom
I have chosen to be with me, there is
one who is an Informer, or false Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser,
(for so the <hi>Greek</hi> word signifies,
and may possibly here be so translated,
rather than <hi>Devil</hi>) who, if I had owned
my self in plain words to have been
the <hi>Messiah, the King of Israel,</hi> would
have betrayed me, and informed against
me.</p>
            <p>That he was yet cautious of owning
himself to his Apostles positively to be
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> appears farther from the
manner wherein he tells <hi>Peter, v.</hi> 18.
that he will build his Church upon that
Confession of his, that he was the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah.</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:60354:55"/>
I say unto thee, <hi>Thou art Cephas,</hi>
or a Rock, <hi>and upon this Rock I will
build my Church, and the gates of Hell
shall not prevail against it.</hi> Words too
doubtful to be laid hold on against him,
as a Testimony that he professed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be the <hi>Messiah;</hi> Especially if we
joyn with them the following words,
<hi>v. 19. And I will give thee the Keys of
the Kingdom of Heaven; And what thou
shalt bind on Earth, shall be bound in
Heaven; and what thou shalt loose on
Earth, shall be loosed in Heaven.</hi> Which
being said Personally to <hi>Peter,</hi> render
the foregoing words of our Saviour
(wherein he declares the Fundamental
Article of his Church to be the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him to be the <hi>Messiah</hi>) the more
obscure and doubtful, and less liable to
be made use of against him; But yet
such as might afterwards be understood.
And for the same reason he yet here
again forbids the Apostles to say that
he was the <hi>Messiah, v.</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>From this time (say the Evangelists)
Jesus <hi>began to shew to his Disciples, (i. e.</hi>
his Apostles, who are often called Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples)
<hi>that he must go to</hi> Jerusalem,
<hi>and suffer many things from the Elders,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60354:55"/>
Chief Priests, and Scribes; and be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and be raised again the third day.</hi>
These, though all marks of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi>
yet how little understood by the
Apostles, or suited to their expectation
of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> appears from <hi>Peter</hi>'s
rebuking him for it in the following
words, <hi>Mat.</hi> XVI. 22. <hi>Peter</hi> had twice
before owned him to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
and yet he cannot here bear that he
should Suffer, and be put to Death, and
be raised again. Whereby we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
how little yet Jesus had explained
to the Apostles what Personally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
himself. They had been a good
while witnesses of his Life and Miracles;
and thereby being grown into a belief
that he was the <hi>Messiah,</hi> were in some
degree prepared to receive the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
that were to fill up that Character,
and answer the Prophesies concerning
him; Which from <hi>henceforth</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to open to them, (though in a way
which the Jews could not form an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation
out of) The time of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of all, in his Sufferings,
Death, and Resurrection, now drawing
on. For this was in the last Year of
his Life; he being to meet the Jews at
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60354:56"/>
               <hi>Ierusalem</hi> but once more at the Passo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
who then should have their will
upon him; And therefore he might
now begin to be a little more open
concerning himself: Though yet so,
as to keep himself out of the reach of
any Accusation, that might appear Just
or Weighty to the <hi>Roman</hi> Deputy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After his Reprimand to</hi> Peter, <hi>telling
him That he</hi> savoured not the things
of God, but of man; Mark <hi>VIII. 34. He
calls the People to him, and prepares
those, who would be his Disciples, for
Suffering; Telling them,</hi> v. 38. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
shall be ashamed of me and my words
in this adulterous and sinful Generation,
of him also shall the Son of Man be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
when he cometh in the Glory of his
Father with the holy Angels: <hi>And then
subjoyns,</hi> Mat. <hi>XVI. 27, 28. two great
and solemn Acts, wherein he would
shew himself to be the</hi> Messiah <hi>the King:</hi>
For the Son of Man shall come in the
Glory of his Father, with his Angels; and
then he shall render every man accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his works. <hi>This is evidently meant
of the Glorious Appearance of his
Kingdom, when he shall come to Judge
the World at the last day; Described
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60354:56"/>
more at large,</hi> Mat XXV. When the
Son of Man shall come in his Glory, and
all the holy Angels with him, then shall
be sit upon the THRONE of his
Glory. Then shall the KING say to
them on his right hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what follows in the place above
quoted, <hi>Mat.</hi> XVI. 28. <hi>Verily, verily,
there be some standing here, who shall
not tast of Death, till they see the Son
of Man coming in his Kingdom;</hi> Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that Dominion, which some there
should see him exercise over the Nation
of the Jews, was so covered; by being
annexed to the preceding <hi>v.</hi> 27. (where
he spoke of the Manifestation and Glory
of his Kingdom at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) That though his plain meaning
here in <hi>v.</hi> 28. be, that the appearance
and visible exercise of his Kingly Power
in his Kingdom was so near, that some
there should live to see it; Yet if the
foregoing words had not cast a shadow
over these later, but they had been left
plainly to be understood, as they plainly
signified, that he should be a King;
And that it was so near, that some there
should see him in his Kingdom; This
might have been laid hold on, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60354:57"/>
made the matter of a plausible and
seemingly just Accusation against him,
by the Jews, before <hi>Pilate.</hi> This seems
to be the reason of our Saviour's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
here the order of the two So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Manifestations to the World of
his Rule and Power; thereby perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at present his meaning, and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
himself, as was necessary, from the
malice of the Jews, which always lay
at catch to intrap him, and accuse him
to the <hi>Roman</hi> Governour; And would,
no doubt, have been ready to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
these words, <hi>Some here shall not
tast of Death, till they see the Son of
Man coming in his Kingdom,</hi> against him,
as Criminal; had not their meaning
been, by the former Verse, perplexed,
and the sense at that time rendred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible,
and not applicable by any
of his Auditors to a sense that might
have been prejudicial to him before the
<hi>Roman</hi> Governour. For how well the
Chief of the Jews were disposed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, <hi>Chap.</hi> XI.
54. <hi>Laying wait for him, and seeking
to catch something out of his mouth, that
they might accuse him:</hi> Which may be
a reason to satisfie us of the seemingly
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60354:57"/>
doubtful and obscure way of speaking
used by our Saviour in other places;
His Circumstances being such, that
without such a Prudent carriage and
reservedness, he could not have gone
through the Work which he came to
do; Nor have performed all the parts
of it, in a way correspondent to the
Descriptions given of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and
which should be afterwards fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
to belong to him, when he
had left the World.</p>
            <p>After this, <hi>Mat.</hi> XVII. 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He,
without saying it in direct words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
as it were, to own himself to his
Apostles to be the <hi>Messiah;</hi> by assuring
them, that as the Scribes, according to
the Prophecy of <hi>Malachy, Chap.</hi> IV. 5.
rightly said, that <hi>Elias</hi> was to Usher in
the <hi>Messiah;</hi> So indeed <hi>Elias</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
come, though the Jews knew
him not, and treated him ill: Whereby
<hi>They understood that he spoke to them of</hi>
John <hi>the</hi> Baptist, <hi>v.</hi> 13. And a little
after he somewhat more plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
that he is the <hi>Messiah,</hi> Mark IX.
41. in these words: <hi>Whosoever shall
give you a cup of water to drink in my
Name, because ye belong to the Messiah.</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:60354:58"/>
This, as I remember, is the first place
where our Saviour ever mentioned the
name of <hi>Messiah;</hi> and the first time that
he went so far towards the owning, to
any of the Jewish Nation, himself to
be him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In his way to</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>bidding one
follow him,</hi> Luke IX. 59. <hi>who would
first bury his Father, v.</hi> 60. Iesus said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, let the dead bury their dead; but
go thou and preach the Kingdom of God.
<hi>And</hi> Luke X. 1. <hi>Sending out the Seventy
Disciples, he says to them,</hi> v. 9. Heal
the sick, and say, the Kingdom of God
is come nigh unto you. <hi>He had nothing
else for these, or for his Apostles, or
any one, it seems, to Preach; but the
good News of the coming of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the</hi> Messiah. <hi>And if any City
would not receive them, he bids them,</hi>
v. 10. Go into the streets of the same,
and say, Even the very dust of your
City, which cleaveth on us, do we wipe
off against you: Notwithstanding, be ye
sure of this, that the Kingdom of God is
come nigh unto you. <hi>This they were to
take notice of, as that which they should
dearly answer for;</hi> viz. <hi>That they
had not with Faith received the good
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60354:58"/>
Tidings of the Kingdom of the</hi> Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After this, his Brethren say unto him,</hi>
Iohn VII. 2, 3, 4. (<hi>The Feast of Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles
being near</hi>) Depart hence, and
go into <hi>Judea,</hi> that thy Disciples also may
see the works that thou doest: For there
is no man that does any thing in secret,
and he himself seeketh to be known openly.
If thou do these things, shew thy self to
the World. <hi>Here his Brethren, which
the next Verse tells us</hi> did not believe
in him, <hi>seem to upbraid him with the
inconsistency of his carriage; as if he
designed to be received for the</hi> Messiah,
<hi>and yet was afraid to shew himself:
To whom he justified his Conduct,
(mentioned v. 1.) in the following ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
by telling them,</hi> That the World
(<hi>meaning the Jews especially</hi>) hated
him, because he testified of it, that the
works thereof are evil; And that his
time was not yet fully come, <hi>wherein to
quit his reserve, and abandon himself
freely to their Malice and Fury: And
therefore, though he</hi> went up unto the
Feast, <hi>it was</hi> not openly; but as it were
in secret, v. 10. <hi>And here coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Temple about the middle of the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60354:59"/>
Feast, he justifies his being sent from
God; And that he had not done any
thing against the Law in curing the
man at the Pool of</hi> Bethesday, v. Iohn
V. 1-16. <hi>on the Sabbath-day; Which,
though done above a year and an half
before, they made use of as a pretence
to destroy him. But what was the true
reason of seeking his Life, appears from
what we have in this</hi> VII. Chapter, v.
25-34. Then said some of them at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
Is not this he whom they seek
to kill? But lo, he speaketh boldly, and
they say nothing unto him. Do the Rulers
know indeed that this is the very Messiah?
Howbeit, we know this man whence he is;
But when the Messiah cometh, no man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
whence he is. Then cryed Iesus in the
Temple, as he taught, ye both know me,
and ye know whence I am: And I am
not come of my self, but he that sent me
is true, whom ye know not. But I know
him, for I am from him, and he hath
sent me. Then they sought [<hi>an occasion</hi>]
to take him, but no man laid hands on
him, because his hour was not yet come.
And many of the people believed on him,
and said, when the Messiah cometh, will
be do more miracles than these which this
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60354:59"/>
man hath done? The Pharisees heard
that the people murmured such things
concerning him; and the Pharisees and
Chief Priests sent Officers to take him.
Then said Iesus unto them, Yet a little
while am I with you, and then I go to
him that sent me: Ye shall seek me, and
not find me; and where I am there ye
cannot come. Then said the Iews among
themselves, Whither will he go, that we
shall not find him? <hi>Here we find that
the great fault in our Saviour, and the
great Provocation to the Jews, was his
being taken for the</hi> Messiah; <hi>and doing
such things as made the People</hi> believe
in him; i. e. <hi>believe that he was the</hi>
Messiah. <hi>Here also our Saviour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
in words very easie to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
at least after his Resurrection,
that he was the</hi> Messiah: <hi>For if he were</hi>
sent from God, <hi>and did his Miracles by
the Spirit of God, there could be no
doubt but he was the</hi> Messiah. <hi>But yet
this Declaration was in a way that the
Pharisees and Priests could not lay hold
on to make an Accusation of, to the
disturbance of his Ministry, or the
seizure of his Person, how much so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they desired it: For his time was
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60354:60"/>
not yet come. The Officers they
had sent to Apprehend him, charmed
with his Discourse, returned without
laying hands on him, v. 45, 46. And
when the Chief Priests asked them,</hi>
Why they brought him not? <hi>They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,</hi>
Never man spake like this man.
<hi>Whereupon the Pharisees reply,</hi> Are
ye also deceived? Have any of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
or of the Pharisees believed on
him? But this people, who know not the
Law, are cursed. <hi>This shews what was
meant by</hi> Believing on him; viz. <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that he was the</hi> Messiah. <hi>For,
say they, have any of the Rulers, who
are skilled in the Law, or of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
and learned Pharisees, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
him to be the</hi> Messiah? <hi>For as
for those who in the Division among
the People concerning him, say,</hi> That
he is the Messiah, <hi>they are ignorant and
vile wretches, know nothing of the
Scripture, and being accursed, are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
up by God to be deceived by this
Impostor, and to take him for the</hi> Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah.
<hi>Therefore, notwithstanding their
desire to lay hold on him, he goes on;
And</hi> v. 37, 38. In the last and great
day of the Feast, Iesus stood and cryed,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60354:60"/>
saying; If any man thirst, let him come
unto me and drink: He that believeth
on me, as the Scripture hath said, out
of his belly shall flow Rivers of living
water. <hi>And thus he here again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
himself to be the</hi> Messiah; <hi>But
in the Prophetick stile; As we may see
by the next Verse of this Chapter, and
those places in the Old Testament that
these words of our Saviour refer to.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next Chapter, <hi>Iohn</hi> VIII. all that
he says concerning himself, and what
they were to believe, tends to this; <hi>viz.</hi>
That he was sent from God his Father;
And that if they did not believe that
he was the <hi>Messiah,</hi> they should die in
their sins: But this in a way, as St. <hi>Iohn</hi>
observes, v. 27. that they did not well
understand. But our Saviour himself
tells them, v. 28. <hi>When ye have lift up
the Son of Man, then shall ye know that
I am he.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Going from them, he Cures the Man
born blind, whom meeting with again,
after the Jews had questioned him, and
cast him out, <hi>Iohn</hi> IX. 35-38. Jesus
<hi>said to him, Dost thou believe on the
Son of God? He answered, who is he,
Lord, that I might believe on him?
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60354:61"/>
And Iesus said unto him, Thou hast both
seen him, and it is he that talketh with
thee. And he said, Lord, I believe.</hi>
Here we see this man is pronounced a
Believer, when all that was proposed
to him to believe, was, that Jesus was
<hi>the Son of God;</hi> Which was, as we have
already shewn, to believe that he was
the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next Chapter, <hi>Iohn</hi> X. 1-21.
he declares the laying down of his Life
for both Jews and Gentiles; But in a
Parable, which they understood not,
<hi>v.</hi> 6. 20.</p>
            <p>As he was going to the Feast of the
Dedication, the Pharisees ask him,
<hi>Luke</hi> XVII. 20. <hi>When the Kingdom of
God, i. e.</hi> of the <hi>Messiah, should come?</hi>
He answers, that it should not come
with Pomp, and Observation, and great
Concourse; But that it was already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
amongst them. If he had stopt
here, the sense had been so plain, that
they could hardly have mistaken him;
or have doubted, but that he meant,
that the <hi>Messiah</hi> was already come, and
amongst them; And so might have
been prone to infer, that Jesus took
upon him to be him. But here, as in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60354:61"/>
the place before taken notice of, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
to this the future Revelation of
himself, both in his coming to execute
Vengeance on the Jews, and in his
coming to Judgment mixed together,
he so involved his sense, that it was
not easie to understand him. And
therefore the Jews came to him again
in the Temple, <hi>Iohn</hi> X. 23. and said,
<hi>How long dost thou make us doubt? If
thou be the Christ tell us plainly. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
answered, I told you, and ye BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIEVED
not: The works that I do
in my Father's Name, they bear witness
of me. But ye BELIEVED not,
because ye are not of my sheep, as I told
you.</hi> The BELIEVING here, which
he accuses them of not doing, is plainly
their not BELIEVING him to be
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> as the foregoing words
evince, and in the same sense it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
meant in the following Verses
of this Chapter.</p>
            <p>From hence <hi>Iesus</hi> going to <hi>Betha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bara,</hi>
and thence returning to <hi>Bethany;</hi>
upon <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Death, <hi>Iohn</hi> XI. 25-27.
Jesus said to <hi>Martha, I am the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
and the Life, he that believeth
in me, though he were dead, yet he shall
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60354:62"/>
live; and whosoever liveth, and believeth
in me, shall not die for ever.</hi> So I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of the <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint,
Gen.</hi> III. 22. or <hi>Iohn</hi> VI. 51.
which we read right in our <hi>English</hi>
Translation, <hi>Live for ever.</hi> But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this saying of our Saviour here
can with truth be translated, <hi>He that
liveth and believeth in me, shall never
die,</hi> will be apt to be questioned. But
to go on. <hi>Believest thou this? She
said unto him, yea, Lord, I believe that
thou art the</hi> Messiah, <hi>the Son of God,
which should come into the World.</hi> This
she gives as a full Answer to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
Demands; This being that Faith,
which whoever had, wanted no more
to make them Believers.</p>
            <p>We may observe farther, in this same
story of the raising of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> what
Faith it was our Saviour expected; by
what he says, <hi>v.</hi> 41, 42. <hi>Father, I
thank thee that thou hast heard me. And
I know that thou hearest me always. But
because of the people who stand by, I said
it, that they may believe that thou hast
sent me.</hi> And what the Consequence
of it was, we may see, <hi>v. 45. Then
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60354:62"/>
many of the Iews who came to</hi> Mary,
<hi>and had seen the things which Iesus did,
believed on him:</hi> Which belief was, that
he was <hi>sent from the Father;</hi> which in
other words was, that he was the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah.</hi>
That this is the meaning, in the
Evangelists, of the Phrase of <hi>believing
on him,</hi> we have a demonstration in the
following words, <hi>v.</hi> 47, 48. <hi>Then ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
the Chief Priests and Pharisees
a Council, and said, what do we? For
this man does many miracles; And if
we let him alone, all men will BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIEVE
ON HIM.</hi> Those who
here say, all men would BELIEVE
ON HIM, were the Chief Priests
and Pharisees his Enemies; who sought
his Life; and therefore could have no
other sense nor thought of this Faith
in him, which they spake of, but only
the believing him to be the <hi>Messiah:</hi>
And that that was their meaning, the
adjoyning words shew. <hi>If we let him
alone, all the World will believe on him;
i.e.</hi> believe him to be the <hi>Messiah. And
the</hi> Romans <hi>will come and take away
both our Place and Nation.</hi> Which
Reasoning of theirs was thus grounded.
If we stand still, and let the People
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60354:63"/>
               <hi>Believe on him, i.e.</hi> receive him for the
<hi>Messiah;</hi> They will thereby take him
and set him up for their King, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
Deliverance by him; Which will
draw the <hi>Roman</hi> Arms upon us, to the
Destruction of us and our Country.
The <hi>Romans</hi> could not be thought to
be at at all concerned in any other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
whatsoever, that the People might
have in him. It is therefore plain,
That <hi>Believing on him,</hi> was, by the
Writers of the Gospel, understood to
mean, <hi>the believing him to be the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah.
The</hi> Sanhedrim <hi>therefore,</hi> v. 53,
54. <hi>from that day forth consulted for
to put him to death. Iesus therefore
walked not yet</hi> (for so the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies,
and so I think it ought here to
be translated) <hi>boldly,</hi> or open-fac'd
<hi>among the Iews; i.e.</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> cannot well here be translated <hi>no
more,</hi> because within a very short time
after, he appeared openly at the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sover,
and by his Miracles and Speech
declared himself more freely than ever
he had done; And all the Week before
his Passion Taught daily in the Temple,
<hi>Mat.</hi> XX. 17. <hi>Mark</hi> X. 32. <hi>Luke</hi> XVIII.
31, &amp;c. The meaning of this place
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60354:63"/>
seems therefore to be this: That his
time being not yet come, he durst
not yet shew himself openly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently,
before the Scribes and Pharisees,
and those of the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> at <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
who were full of Malice against
him, and had resolved his Death; <hi>But
went thence unto a Country near the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
into a City called</hi> Ephraim, <hi>and
there continued with his Disciples,</hi> to
keep himself out of the way till the
Passover, <hi>which was nigh at hand,</hi> v. 55.
In his return thither, he takes the
Twelve aside, and tells them before
hand what should happen to him at
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> whither they were now go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
And that all things that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by the Prophets concerning the Son
of Man, should be accomplished. That
he should be betrayed to the Chief
Priests and Scribes; And that they
should Condemn him to Death, and
deliver him to the Gentiles; That he
should be mocked, and spit on, and
scourged, and put to Death; and the
third day he should rise again. But
St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, <hi>Chap.</hi> XVIII. 34. That
the Apostles <hi>understood none of these
things, and this saying was hid from
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60354:64"/>
them; neither knew they the things which
were spoken.</hi> They believed him to be
the Son of God, the <hi>Messiah</hi> sent from
the Father; But their Notion of the
<hi>Messiah</hi> was the same with the rest of
the Jews; That he should be a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Prince and Deliverer. That which
distinguished them from the Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Jews, was, That they believed
Jesus to be the very <hi>Messiah,</hi> and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him as their King and Lord ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.
We see, <hi>Mark</hi> X. 35. That
even in this their last Journey with him
to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> two of them, <hi>Iames</hi> and
<hi>Iohn,</hi> coming to him, and falling at
his Feet, said, <hi>Grant unto us, that we
may fit, one on thy right hand, and the
other on thy left hand, in thy Glory;</hi>
Or, as. St. <hi>Matthew</hi> has it, <hi>Chap.</hi> XX.
21. <hi>in thy Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the hour being come that
the Son of Man should be glorified, he,
without his usual Reserve, makes his
Publick Entry into <hi>Ierusalem, Riding
on a Young Ass; As it is written, Fear
not, Daughter of</hi> Sion, <hi>behold, thy King
cometh fitting on an Asses Colt.</hi> But
<hi>these things,</hi> says St. <hi>Iohn, Chap.</hi> XII. 16.
<hi>his Disciples understood not at the first;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60354:64"/>
But when Iesus was glorified, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
they that these things were
written of him, and that they had done
these things unto him.</hi> Though the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
believed him to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
yet there were many Occurrences of
his Life which they understood not, at
the time when they happened, to be
fore-told of the <hi>Messiah;</hi> which after
his Ascension they found exactly to
quadrate. <hi>And all the People crying</hi>
Hosanna, <hi>Blessed is the King of</hi> Israel,
<hi>that cometh in the Name of the Lord;</hi>
This was so open a Declaration of his
being the <hi>Messiah,</hi> that <hi>Luke</hi> XIX. 39.
<hi>Some of the Pharisees from among the
multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke
thy Disciples.</hi> But he was so far from
stopping them, or disowning this their
Acknowledgment of his being the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi>
That he <hi>said unto them, I tell
you, that if these should hold their peace,
the stones would immediately cry out.</hi>
And again, upon the like occasion of
their crying <hi>Hosanna, to the Son of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
in the Temple, <hi>Mat.</hi> XXI. 15, 16.
When <hi>the Chief Priests and Scribes were
sore displeased, and said unto him, Hearest
thou what they say? Iesus said unto
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60354:65"/>
them, yea; Have ye never read, Out of
the months of Babes and Sucklings thou
hast perfected Praise?</hi> And now, <hi>v.</hi> 14,
15. <hi>He cures the Blind and the Lame</hi>
openly <hi>in the Temple. And when the
Chief Priests and Scribes saw the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
things that he did, and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
crying in the Temple</hi> Hosanna, <hi>they
were enraged.</hi> One would not think,
that after the multitude of Miracles
that our Saviour had now been doing
for above three Years together, that
the curing the Lame and Blind should
so much move them. But we must
remember, that though his Ministry
had abounded with Miracles, yet the
most of them had been done about
<hi>Galilee,</hi> and in Parts remote from <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem:</hi>
There is but one left upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
hitherto done in that City; And
that had so ill a Reception, that they
sought his Life for it; as we may read,
<hi>Iohn</hi> V. 16. And therefore we hear
not of his being at the next Passover,
because he was there only privately, as
an ordinary Jew: The reason whereof
we may read, <hi>Iohn</hi> VII. 1. <hi>After these
things, Iesus walked in</hi> Galilee, <hi>for he
would not walk in</hi> Jewry, <hi>because the
Iews sought to kill him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:60354:65"/>
Hence we may guess the reason why
St. <hi>Iohn</hi> omitted the mention of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> at the third Passover
after his Baptism; probably because he
did nothing memorable there. Indeed,
when he was at the Feast of Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
immediately preceding this his
last Passover, he cured the Man born
blind: But it appears not to have been
done in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> it self, but in the way
as he retired to the Mount of <hi>Olives;</hi>
for there seems to have been no body
by, when he did it, but his Apostles.
Compare <hi>v.</hi> 2. with <hi>v.</hi> 8. 10. of <hi>Iohn</hi> IX.
This, at least, is remarkable; That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Cure of this Blind Man, nor
that of the other Infirm Man, at the
Passover above a twelve Month before
at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> was done in the sight of
the Scribes, Pharisees, Chief Priests, or
Rulers. Nor was it without reason,
that in the former part of his Ministry
he was cautious of shewing himself to
be the <hi>Messiah;</hi> And by repeated Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
done in their sight before the
People, of provoking the Rulers in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
where he was in their Power.
But now that he was come to the last
Scene of his Life, and that the Passover
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60354:66"/>
was come, the appointed time wherein
he was to compleat the Work he came
for, in his Death and Resurrection, he
does many things in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> it self,
before the face of the Scribes, Pharisees,
and whole Body of the Jewish Nation,
to manifest himself to be the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
And, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> says, <hi>Chap.</hi> XIX. 47,
48. <hi>He taught daily in the Temple:
But the Chief Priests, and the Scribes,
and the Chief of the People sought to
destroy him; And could not find what
they might do, for all the People were
very attentive to hear him.</hi> What he
taught, we are not left to guess, by
what we have found him constantly
Preaching elsewhere; (the Kingdom of
God's being come, and requiring Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.)
But St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, <hi>Chap.</hi> XX.
1. <hi>He taught in the Temple, and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelized;</hi>
Or, as we translate it, <hi>preached
the Gospel:</hi> Which, as we have shewed,
was the making known to them the
Good News of the Kingdom of the
<hi>Messiah.</hi> And this we shall find he did,
in what now remains of his History.</p>
            <p>In the first Discourse of his, which
we find upon Record after this, <hi>Iohn</hi>
XII. 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he fore-tells his Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60354:66"/>
and the belief of all sorts, both
<hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> on him after that.
Whereupon the People say to him, <hi>v.</hi>
34. <hi>We have heard out of the Law,
that the Messiah abideth for ever; And
how sayest thou, that the Son of Man
must be lifted up? Who is this Son of
Man?</hi> In his Answer he plainly designs
himself, under the Name of <hi>Light;</hi>
which was what he had declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to them to be, the last time that
they had seen him in <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> For
then at the Feast of Tabernacles, but
six Months before, he tells them in the
very place where he now is, <hi>viz.</hi> in
the Temple, <hi>I am the Light of the
World; whosoever follows me, shall not
walk in darkness, but shall have the light
of Life;</hi> As we may read, <hi>Iohn</hi> VIII.
12. &amp; IX 5. He says, <hi>As long as I am
in the World, I am the LIGHT of
the World.</hi> But neither here, nor any
where else, does he, even in these four
or five last days of his Life (though
he knew his hour was come, and was
prepared for his Death, <hi>v.</hi> 27. And scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
not to manifest himself to the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
of the Jews to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> by
doing Miracles before them in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60354:67"/>
ever once in direct words own
himself to the Jews to be the <hi>Messiah;</hi>
Though by Miracles, and other ways,
he did every where make it known to
them, so that it might be understood.
This could not be without some Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
And the Preservation of his Life,
which he came now to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> on
purpose to lay down, could not be it.
What other could it then be, but the
same which had made him use Caution
in the former part of his Ministry; so
to conduct himself, that he might do
the Work which he came for, and in
all parts answer the Character given of
the <hi>Messiah</hi> in the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets?
He had fulfilled the time of
his Ministry; and now Taught, and did
Miracles openly in the Temple, before
the Rulers and the People, not fearing
to be seized. But he would not be
seized for any thing that might make
him a Criminal to the Government;
And therefore he avoided giving those,
who in the Division that was about him
enclined towards him, occasion of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
for his sake; Or to the Jews his
Enemies, matter of Just Accusation
against him out of his own mouth, by
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60354:67"/>
professing himself to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
the King of <hi>Israel</hi> in direct words. It
was enough, that by words and deeds
he declared it so to them, that they
could not but understand him; which
'tis plain they did, <hi>Luke</hi> XX. 16. 19.
<hi>Mat.</hi> XXI. 45. But yet neither his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
which were only doing of Good;
nor Words, which were Mystical and
Parabolical; (As we may see, <hi>Mat.</hi> XXI.
&amp; XXII. And the Parallel places of
<hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke;</hi>) Nor any of his
ways of making himself known to be
the <hi>Messiah;</hi> could be brought in Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,
or urged against him, as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
or dangerous to the Government.
This preserved him from being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
as a Malefactor; and procured
him a Testimony from the <hi>Roman</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
his Judge, that he was an Innocent
Man, sacrificed to the Envy of
the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation. So that he avoided
saying that he was the <hi>Messiah,</hi> that to
those who would reflect on his Life and
Death after his Resurrection, he might
the more clearly appear to be so. It is
farther to be remarked, that though
he often appeals to the Testimony of
his Miracles who he is, yet he never
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60354:68"/>
tells the <hi>Iews</hi> that he was born at
<hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem;</hi>
to remove the Prejudice that
lay against him, whilst he passed for a
<hi>Galilean,</hi> and which was urged as a
Proof that he was not the <hi>Messiah,
Iohn</hi> VII. 41, 42. The healing of the
Sick, and doing of Good miraculously,
could be no Crime in him, nor Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
against him. But the naming of
<hi>Bethlehem</hi> for his Birth-place, might
have wrought as much upon the mind
of <hi>Pilate,</hi> as it did on <hi>Herod's;</hi> and
have raised a Suspicion in him as Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to his Innocence, as <hi>Herod</hi>'s
was to the Children born there. His
pretending to be born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> as
it was liable to be explained by the
<hi>Iews,</hi> could not have failed to have
met with a sinister Interpretation in the
<hi>Roman</hi> Governour, and have rendred
<hi>Iesus</hi> suspected of some Criminal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
against the Government. And
hence we see, that when <hi>Pilate</hi> asked
him, <hi>Iohn</hi> XIX. 9. <hi>Whence art thou?
Iesus gave him no answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether our Saviour had not an Eye
to this straitness, this narrow room
that was left to his Conduct, between
the new Converts and the captious
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60354:68"/>
Jews, when he says, <hi>Luke</hi> XII. 50. <hi>I
have a Baptism to be baptized with, and
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> how am I straitned till
it be accomplished,</hi> I leave to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.
<hi>I am come to send fire on the
Earth,</hi> says our Saviour, <hi>and what if
it be already kindled? i.e.</hi> There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
already to be Divisions about me,
<hi>v. Iohn</hi> VII. 12. 43. &amp; IX. 16. &amp; X. 19.
And I have not the freedom, the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
to declare my self openly as I am,
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> till after my Death. My
way to my Throne is closely hedged
in on every side, and much straitned,
within which I must keep, till it bring
me to my Cross; in its due time and
manner, so that it do not cut short
the time, nor cross the end of my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry.</p>
            <p>And therefore to keep up this inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive
Character, and not to let it
come within the reach of Accident or
Calumny, he withdrew with his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
out of the Town every Evening;
and kept himself retired out of the
way, <hi>Luke</hi> XXI. 37. <hi>And in the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
he was teaching in the Temple, and
every night he went out and abode in the
Mount that is called the Mount of Olives;</hi>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:60354:69"/>
That he might avoid all Concourse to
him in the Night, and give no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Disturbance, or Suspicion of
himself in that great conflux of the
whole Nation of the <hi>Iews,</hi> now assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> at the Passover.</p>
            <p>But to return to his Preaching in the
Temple. He bids them, <hi>Iohn</hi> XII. 36.
<hi>To believe in the light whilst they have
it.</hi> And he tells them, <hi>v. 46. I am the
light come into the World, that every
one who believes in me should not remain
in darkness.</hi> Which believing in him,
was the believing him to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
as I have elsewhere shewed.</p>
            <p>The next day, <hi>Mat.</hi> XXI. he rebukes
them for not having believed <hi>Iohn</hi> the
<hi>Baptist,</hi> who had testified that he was
the <hi>Messiah.</hi> And then, in a Parable,
declares himself to be the <hi>Son of God,</hi>
whom they should destroy; And that
for it God would take away the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the <hi>Messiah</hi> from them, and
give it to the Gentiles. That they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
him thus, is plain from <hi>Luke</hi>
XX. 16. <hi>And when they heard it, they
said, God forbid.</hi> And <hi>v. 19. For they
knew that he had spoken this Parable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:60354:69"/>
Much to the same purpose was his
next Parable concerning <hi>the Kingdom of
Heaven, Mat.</hi> XXII. 1-10. That the
Jews not accepting of the Kingdom of
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> to whom it was first offered,
others should be brought in.</p>
            <p>The Scribes and Pharisees, and Chief
Priests, not able to bear the declaration
he made of himself to be the <hi>Messiah;</hi>
(by his Discourses and Miracles <hi>before</hi>
them, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Iohn</hi> XII. 37.
which he had never done before) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
of his Preaching and Miracles;
and being not able otherwise to stop
the increase of his Followers; (For, <hi>said
the Pharisees among themselves, perceive
ye how ye prevail nothing? Behold, the
World is gone after him, Iohn</hi> XII. 19.
So that <hi>the Chief Priests, and the Scribes,
and the Chief of the People) sought to
destroy him,</hi> the first day of his entrance
into <hi>Ierusalem, Luke</hi> XIX. 47. The
next day again they were intent upon
the same thing, <hi>Mark</hi> XI. 17, 18. <hi>And
he taught</hi> in the Temple; <hi>And the
Scribes, and the Chief Priests heard it,
and sought how they might destroy him;
For they feared him, because all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were astonished at his Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:60354:70"/>
The next day but one, upon his tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them the Kingdom of the <hi>Messiah</hi>
should be taken from them; <hi>The Chief
Priests and Scribes sought to lay hands
on him the same hour; and they feared
the People,</hi> Luke XX. 19. If they had
so great a desire to lay hold on him,
why did they not? They were the
Chief Priests and the Rulers, the men
of Power. The reason St. <hi>Luke</hi> plainly
tells us, in the next Verse: <hi>And they
watched him, and sent forth Spies, which
should feign themselves just men, that
they might take hold of his words; that
so they might deliver him unto the Power
and Authority of the Governour.</hi> They
wanted matter of Accusation, against
him, to the Power they were under.
That they watched for; and that they
would have been glad of, if they could
have <hi>entangled him in his talk;</hi> As St.
<hi>Matthew</hi> expresses it, <hi>Chap.</hi> XXII. 15.
If they could have laid hold on any
word that had dropt from him, that
might have rendred him guilty or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
to the <hi>Roman</hi> Governour; That
would have served their turn, to have
laid hold upon him, with hopes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
him. For their Power not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60354:70"/>
their Malice, they could not
put him to Death by their own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
without the Permission and Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Governour; as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
<hi>Iohn</hi> XVIII. 31. <hi>It is not lawful for
us to put any man to Death.</hi> This made
them so earnest for a declaration in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
words, from his own mouth, that
he was the <hi>Messiah.</hi> 'Twas not that
they would more have believed in him,
for such a declaration of himself, than
they did for his Miracles, or other
ways of making himself known, which
it appears they understood well enough.
But they wanted plain direct words,
such as might support an Accusation,
and be of weight before an Heathen
Judge. This was the Reason why they
pressed him to speak out, <hi>Iohn</hi> X. 24.
<hi>Then came the Iews round about him,
and said unto him, How long dost thou
hold us in suspense? If thou be the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,
tell us PLAINLY,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
i. e. in direct words: For that St. <hi>Iohn</hi>
uses it in that sense, we may see, <hi>Chap.</hi>
XI. 11-14. Jesus saith to them, <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus
sleepeth.</hi> His Disciples said, <hi>If,
he sleeps, he shall do well; Howbeit,
Iesus spake of his Death; but they
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60354:71"/>
thought he had spoken of taking of rest
in sleep. Then said Iesus to them plainly,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Lazarus <hi>is dead.</hi> Here we
see what is meant by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, PLAIN
direct words, such as express the thing
without a Figure; And so they would
have had Jesus pronounce himself to be
the <hi>Messiah.</hi> And the same thing they
press again, <hi>Mat.</hi> XVI. 63. The High-Priest
adjuring him by the Living God, to
tell them whether he were the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
the Son of God; As we shall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to take notice by and by.</p>
            <p>This we may observe in the whole
management of their Design against
his Life. It turned upon this; That
they wanted and wished for a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from him, in direct words, that he
was the <hi>Messiah:</hi> Something from his
own mouth, that might offend the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Power, and render him Criminal
to <hi>Pilate.</hi> In the 21<hi>st.</hi> Verse of this
XX of <hi>Luke, They asked him, saying,
Master, we know that thou sayest and
teachest rightly; neither acceptest thou
the Person of any, but teachest the way
of God truly. Is it lawful for us to give
Tribute to</hi> Caesar <hi>or no?</hi> By this cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Question they hoped to catch him,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60354:71"/>
which way soever he answered. For
if he had said, they ought to pay Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to <hi>Caesar,</hi> 'twould be plain he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
their Subjection to the <hi>Romans;</hi>
And so in effect disowned himself to be
their King and Deliverer: Whereby he
would have contradicted, what his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
and Doctrine seemed to aim at, the
Opinion that was spread amongst the
People, that he was the <hi>Messiah.</hi> This
would have quash'd the Hopes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
the Faith of those who believed
on him; and have turned the Ears and
Hearts of the People from him. If on
the other side, he answered <hi>No,</hi> it is not
Lawful to pay Tribute to <hi>Caesar;</hi> they
had had out of his own mouth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
to Condemn him before <hi>Pontius
Pilate.</hi> But St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, <hi>v.</hi> 23.
<hi>He perceived their Craftiness, and said
unto them, Why tempt ye me? i. e.</hi> Why
do ye'lay Snares for me? <hi>Ye Hypocrites,
shew me the Tribute-money;</hi> So it is,
<hi>Mat.</hi> XXII. 19. <hi>Whose Image and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
has it? They said,</hi> Caesar<hi>'s. He
said unto them, Render therefore to</hi> Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar
<hi>the things that are</hi> Caesar's; <hi>and to
God the things that are God's.</hi> By the
Wisdom and Caution of which unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60354:72"/>
Answer, he defeated their whole
Design. <hi>And they could not take hold
of his words before the People; And they
marvelled at his answer, and held their
peace,</hi> Luke XX. 26. <hi>And leaving him,
they departed, Mat.</hi> XXII. 22.</p>
            <p>He having by this Reply, (and what
he answered to the <hi>Sadducees</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Resurrection, And to the <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer,</hi>
about the First Commandment,
<hi>Mark</hi> XII.) Answered so little to their
Satisfaction or Advantage; they durst
ask him no more Questions, any of them.
And now their mouths being stop'd, he
himself begins to Question them about
the <hi>Messiah;</hi> Asking the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> Mat.
XXII. 41. <hi>What think ye of the Messiah,
whose Son is he? They say unto him, The
Son of David.</hi> Wherein, though they
answered right, yet he shews them in
the following words, that however they
pretended to be Studiers and Teachers
of the Law, yet they understood not
clearly the Scriptures concerning the
<hi>Messiah;</hi> And thereupon he sharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes
their Hypocrisie, Vanity, Pride,
Malice, Covetousness, and Ignorance;
And particularly tells them, <hi>v. 13. ye
shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60354:72"/>
men: For ye neither go in your selves, nor
suffer ye them that are entring, to go in.</hi>
Whereby he plainly declares to them,
that the <hi>Messiah</hi> was come, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
began; But that they refused to
believe in him themselves, and did all
they could to hinder others from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
in him; As is manifest through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the New Testament: The History
whereof sufficiently explains what is
meant here by <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven,</hi>
Which the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> would
neither go into themselves, nor suffer
others to enter into. And they could
not choose but understand him, though
he named not himself in the case.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Provoked a new by his Rebukes, they
get presently to Council,</hi> Mat. <hi>XXVI.</hi>
Then assembled together the Chief Priest,
and the Scribes, and the Elders of the
People, unto the Palace of the High-Priest,
who was called <hi>Caiphas,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
that they might take Iesus by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty,
and kill him. But they said, Not
on the Feast-day, lest there be an Vproar
among the People. For they feared the
People, <hi>says St.</hi> Luke, Chap. XXII. 2.</p>
            <p>Having in the Night got Jesus into
their Hands, by the Treachery of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:60354:73"/>
they presently led him away bound
to <hi>Annas</hi> the High-Priest, <hi>Iohn</hi> XVIII.
13. 19. <hi>The High-Priest then asked Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
of his Disciples, and of his Doctrine.
Iesus answered him, I spake openly to
the World; I ever taught in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,
and in the Temple, whither the
Iews always resort; And in secret have
I said nothing.</hi> A Proof that he had
not in private to his Disciples declared
himself in express words to be the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi>
the Prince. But he goes on. <hi>Why
askest thou me?</hi> Ask <hi>Iudas,</hi> who has
been always with me. <hi>Ask them who
heard me, what I have said unto them;
behold, they know what I said.</hi> Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
we see here warily declines, for
the Reasons above mentioned, all Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of his Doctrine. <hi>Annas</hi> getting
nothing out of him for his turn, <hi>v.</hi> 24.
sends him away to <hi>Caiphas,</hi> and the
<hi>Sanhedrim;</hi> who, <hi>Mat.</hi> XXVI. 59. <hi>Sought
false Witness against him:</hi> But when
they found none that were sufficient,
or came up to the Point they desired;
which was to have something against
him to take away his Life, (For so I
think the words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> mean,
<hi>Mark</hi> XIV. 56. 59.) They try again
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60354:73"/>
what they can get out of him himself,
concerning his being the <hi>Messiah;</hi> Which
if he owned in express words, they
thought they should have enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him at the Tribunal of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Governour, to make him <hi>Laesae
Majestatis reum,</hi> and so to take away
his Life. They therefore say to him,
<hi>Luke</hi> XXII. 67. <hi>If thou be the Messiah,
tell us.</hi> Nay, as St. <hi>Matthew</hi> hath it,
the High-Priest adjures him by the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God to tell them whether he were
the <hi>Messiah.</hi> To which our Saviour
replies: <hi>If I tell you, ye will not believe;
And if I ask you, ye will not answer me,
nor let me go.</hi> If I tell you, and prove
to you, by the Testimony given of me
from Heaven, and by the Works that
I have done among you, you will not
believe in me, that I am the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
Or if I should ask you where the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi>
is to be Born; and what State he
should come in; how he should appear,
and other things that you think in me
are not reconcileable with the <hi>Messiah;</hi>
You will not answer me, and let me
go, as one that has no pretence to be
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and you are not afraid
should be received for such. But yet
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60354:74"/>
I tell you, <hi>Hereafter shall the Son of
Man sit on the right hand of the Power
of God, v. 70. Then said they all, Art
thou then the Son of God? And he said
unto them, ye say that I am.</hi> By which
Discourse with them, related at large
here by St. <hi>Luke,</hi> it is plain, that the
Answer of our Saviour, set down by
St. <hi>Matthew, Chap.</hi> XXVI. 64. in these
words, <hi>Thou hast said;</hi> And by St.
<hi>Mark, Chap.</hi> XIV. 62. in these, <hi>I am;</hi>
Is an Answer only to this Question,
<hi>Art thou then the Son of God?</hi> And not
to that other, <hi>Art thou the Messiah?</hi>
Which preceded, and he had answered
to before: Though <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi>
contracting the story, set them down
together, as if making but one Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion;
omitting all the intervening Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course;
Whereas 'tis plain out of St.
<hi>Luke,</hi> that they were two distinct Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,
to which <hi>Iesus</hi> gave two distinct
Answers. In the first whereof, he, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his usual Caution, declined
saying in plain express words, that he
was the <hi>Messiah;</hi> though in the latter
he owned himself to be <hi>the Son of God.</hi>
Which, though they being <hi>Iews,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
to signifie the <hi>Messiah;</hi> Yet he
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60354:74"/>
knew could be no Legal or Weighty
Accusation against him before a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then;
and so it proved. For upon his
answering to their Question, <hi>Art thou
then the Son of God? Ye say that I am;</hi>
They cry out, <hi>Luke</hi> XXII. 71. <hi>What
need we any further witnesses? For we
our selves have heard out of his own
mouth:</hi> And so thinking they had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
against him, they hurry him
away to <hi>Pilate. Pilate</hi> asking them,
<hi>Iohn</hi> XVIII. 29-32. <hi>What Accusation
bring you against this man? They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
and said, if he were not a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor,
we would not have delivered
him up unto thee.</hi> Then said <hi>Pilate</hi>
unto them, <hi>Take ye him, and Iudge him
according to your Law.</hi> But this would
not serve their turn, who aimed at his
Life, and would be satisfied with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else. <hi>The Iews therefore said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, It is not lawful for us to put
any man to death.</hi> And this was also,
<hi>That the saying of Iesus might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
which he spake, signifying what
Death he should dye.</hi> Pursuing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Design, of making him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> guilty of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
against <hi>Caesar,</hi> Luke XXIII. 2. <hi>They
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60354:75"/>
began to accuse him, saying; We found
this Fellow perverting the Nation, and
forbidding to give Tribute to</hi> Caesar;
<hi>saying, that he himself is the Messiah the
King:</hi> All which were Inferences of
theirs, from his saying, he was <hi>the Son
of God:</hi> Which <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> finding
(for 'tis consonant, that he examined
them to the precise words he had said)
their Accusation had no weight with
him. However, the Name of King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
suggested against Jesus, he thought
himself concerned to search it to the
bottom. <hi>Iohn</hi> XVIII. 33-37. <hi>Then</hi>
Pilate <hi>entred again into the Iudgment-Hall,
and called Iesus, and said unto
him, Art thou the King of the Iews?
Iesus answered him, Sayest thou this of
thy self, or did others tell it thee of me?</hi>
Pilate <hi>answered, am I a Iew? Thine own
Nation and the Chief Priest have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
thee unto me: What hast thou
done? Iesus answered, My Kingdom is
not of this World: If my Kingdom were
of this World, then would my servants
fight, that I should not be delivered to
the Iews: But my Kingdom is not from
hence.</hi> Pilate <hi>therefore said unto him,
Art thou a King then? Iesus answered,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60354:75"/>
Thou sayest that I am a King. For this
end was I born, and for this cause came
I into the World, that I should bear
witness to the Truth: Every one that is
of the Truth heareth my voice.</hi> In this
Dialogue between our Saviour and <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi>
we may Observe, 1. That being
asked, whether he were <hi>the King of the
Iews?</hi> He answers so, that though he
deny it not, yet he avoided giving the
least Umbrage, that he had any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
upon the Government. For though
he allows himself to be a King, yet to
obviate any suspicion, he tells <hi>Pilate
His Kingdom is not of this World;</hi> And
evidences it by this, that if he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to any Title to that Country,
his followers, which were not a few,
and were forward enough to believe
him their King, would have fought for
him; if he had had a mind to set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
up by force, or his Kingdom were
so to be erected. <hi>But my Kingdom,</hi>
says he, <hi>is not from hence;</hi> Is not of
this fashion, or of this place.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Pilate,</hi> being by his words and
circumstances satisfied that he laid no
Claim to his Province, or meant any
Disturbance of the Government, was
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60354:76"/>
yet a little surprized to hear a Man, in
that poor Garb, without Retinue, or
so much as a Servant or a Friend, own
himself to be a King; And therefore
asks him, with some kind of wonder,
<hi>Art thou a King then?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. That our Saviour declares, that
his great business into the World was,
to testifie and make good this great
Truth, that he was a King; <hi>i. e.</hi> in
other words, that he was the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. That whoever were followers of
Truth, and got into the way of Truth
and Happiness, received this Doctrine
concerning him, <hi>viz.</hi> That he was the
<hi>Messiah</hi> their King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pilate</hi> being thus satisfied, that he
neither meant, nor could there arise any
harm from his pretence, whatever it
was, to be a King; Tells the Jews, v. 38.
<hi>I find no fault in this man.</hi> But the Jews
were the more fierce, <hi>Luke</hi> XXIII. 5.
saying, <hi>He stirreth up the people</hi> to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
by <hi>his Preaching through all</hi> Jewry,
<hi>beginning from</hi> Galilee <hi>to this place.</hi> And
then <hi>Pilate,</hi> learning that he was of
<hi>Galilee, Herod</hi>'s Jurisdiction, sent him
to <hi>Herod;</hi> to whom also <hi>the Chief
Priest and Scribes,</hi> v. 10. <hi>vehemently
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60354:76"/>
accused him. Herod</hi> finding all their
Accusations either false or frivolous,
thought our Saviour a bare Object of
Contempt; And so turning him only
into Ridicule, sent him back to <hi>Pilate:</hi>
Who calling unto him the Chief Priests,
and the Rulers, and the People, v. 14.
<hi>Said unto them, Ye have brought this
man unto me, as one that perverteth the
People; And behold, I having examined
him before you, have found no fault in
this man, touching these things whereof
ye accuse him; No, nor yet</hi> Herod; <hi>for I
sent you to him: And so nothing worthy
of Death is done by him:</hi> And therefore
he would have released him. <hi>For he
knew the Chief Priests had delivered him
through envy, Mark</hi> XV. 10. And when
they demanded <hi>Barrabbas</hi> to be released,
but as for Jesus, cryed, Crucifie him;
<hi>Luke</hi> XXIII. 22. Pilate <hi>said unto them
the third time, Why? What evil hath
he done? I have found no cause of death
in him; I will therefore chastise him,
and let him go.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may observe in all this whole
Prosecution of the Jews, that they
would fain have got it out of <hi>Iesus</hi>'s
own mouth, in express words, that he
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60354:77"/>
was the <hi>Messiah:</hi> Which not being able
to do with all their Art and Endeavour;
All the rest that they could alledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, not amounting to a Proof
before <hi>Pilate,</hi> that he claimed to be
King of the Jews; or that he had caused
or done any thing towards a Mutiny
or Insurrection among the People; (for
upon these two, as we see, their whole
Charge turned) <hi>Pilate</hi> again and again
pronounced him innocent: For so he
did a fourth, and a fifth time; bringing
him out to them, after he had whip'd
him, <hi>Iohn</hi> XIX. 4. 6. And after all,
<hi>When</hi> Pilate <hi>saw that he could prevail
nothing, but that rather a Tumult was
made, he took Water, and washed his
hands before the multitude, saying, I am
innocent of the Blood of this just man;
see you to it, Mat.</hi> XXVII. 24. Which
gives us a clear reason of the cautious
and wary Conduct of our Saviour; in
not declaring himself, in the whole
course of his Ministry, so much as to his
Disciples, much less to the Multitude or
the Rulers of the Jews, in express words,
to be the <hi>Messiah</hi> the King: And why
he kept himself always in Prophetical
or Parabolical terms: (He and his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60354:77"/>
Preaching only the Kingdom of
God, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> to be come)
And left to his Miracles to declare who
he was; Though this was the Truth,
which he came into the World, as he
says himself, <hi>Iohn</hi> XVIII. 37. to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
and which his Disciples were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Pilate,</hi> satisfied of his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
would have released him; And
the Jews persisted to cry out, <hi>Crucifie
him, Crucifie him, Iohn</hi> XIX. 6. Pilate
<hi>says to them, Take ye him your selves,
and Crucifie him: For I do not find any
fault in him.</hi> The Jews then, since
they could not make him a State-Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal,
by alledging his saying that he
was <hi>the Son of God;</hi> say, by their Law
it was a Capital Crime, v. 7. <hi>The Iews
answered to</hi> Pilate, <hi>We have a Law, and
by our Law he ought to die; because he
made himself the Son of God.</hi> After
this, <hi>Pilate</hi> was the more desirous to
release him, v. 12, 13. <hi>But the Iews
cried out, saying, If thou let this man
go, thou art not</hi> Caesar<hi>'s Friend: Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
maketh himself a King, speaketh
against</hi> Caesar. Here we see the stress
of their Charge against Jesus; whereby
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60354:78"/>
they hoped to take away his Life; <hi>viz.</hi>
That he <hi>made himself King.</hi> We see
also upon what they grounded this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation,
<hi>viz.</hi> Because he had owned
himself to be <hi>the Son of God.</hi> For he
had, in their hearing, never made or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
himself to be a King. We see
here likewise the reason why they were
so desirous to draw, from his own
mouth, a Confession in express words
that he was the <hi>Messiah; viz.</hi> That they
might have what might be a clear Proof
that he did so. And last of all, we
see the reason why, though in Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
which they understood, he owned
himself to them to be the <hi>Messiah;</hi> yet
he avoided declaring it to them, in such
words as might look Criminal at <hi>Pilate</hi>'s
Tribunal. He owned himself to be
the <hi>Messiah</hi> plainly to the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>Iews;</hi> But in ways that could
not, to the Understanding of <hi>Pilate,</hi>
make it appear that he laid claim to
the Kingdom of <hi>Iudea,</hi> or went about
to make himself King of that Country.
But whether his saying, that he was
<hi>the Son of God,</hi> was Criminal by their
Law, that <hi>Pilate</hi> troubled not himself
about.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:60354:78"/>
He that considers what <hi>Tacitus, Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius,
Seneca, de Benef.</hi> l. 3. c. 26. Say
of <hi>Tiberius</hi> and his Reign, will find how
necessary it was for our Saviour, if he
would not dye as a Criminal and a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
to take great heed to his words
and actions; that he did, or said not
any thing, that might be offensive, or
give the least Umbrage to the <hi>Roman</hi>
Government. It behoved an Innocent
Man, who was taken notice of for
something Extraordinary in him, to be
very wary; Under a jealous and cruel
Prince, who encouraged Informations,
and filled his Reign with Executions for
Treason; Under whom words spoken
innocently, or in jest, if they could
be misconstrued, were made Treason;
and prosecuted with a Rigor, that made
it always the same thing to be accused
and condemned. And therefore we see,
that when the <hi>Iews</hi> told <hi>Pilate, Iohn</hi>
XIX. 12. That he should not be a Friend
to <hi>Caesar,</hi> if he let <hi>Iesus</hi> go; (For that
whoever made himself King, was a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
against <hi>Caesar;</hi>) He asks them no
more, whether they would take <hi>Barrab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi>
and spare <hi>Iesus;</hi> But (though
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60354:79"/>
against his Conscience) gives him up
to Death, to secure his own Head.</p>
            <p>One thing more there is, that gives
us light into this wise and necessarily
cautious management of himself, which
manifestly agrees with it, and makes a
part of it: And that is, the choice of
his Apostles; exactly suited to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
and fore-sight of the Necessity of
keeping the declaration of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> which was now
expected, within certain general terms
during his Ministry; And not opening
himself too plainly or forwardly, to the
heady Jews, that he himself was the
<hi>Messiah;</hi> but leaving it to be found out
by the Observation of those who would
attend to the Purity of his Life, and
the Testimony of his Miracles, and
the Conformity of all with the Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
concerning him; without an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
promulgation that he was the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> till after his Death. His King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
was to be opened to them by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
as well to prepare them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it, as to enable him to be long
enough amongst them; to perform what
was the work of the <hi>Messiah</hi> to be done;
and fulfil all those several parts of what
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60354:79"/>
was foretold of him in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and we see applyed to him in
the New.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iews</hi> had no other thoughts of
their <hi>Messiah,</hi> but of a Mighty Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Prince, that should raise their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
into an higher degree of Power,
Dominion, and Prosperity than ever it
had enjoyed. They were filled with
the expectation of a Glorious Earthly
Kingdom. It was not therefore for a
Poor Man, the Son of a Carpenter,
and (as they thought) born in <hi>Galilee,</hi>
to pretend to it. None of the <hi>Iews,</hi>
no not his Disciples, could have born
this; if he had expresly avowed this at
first, and began his Preaching, and the
opening of his Kingdom this way;
Especially if he had added to it, that
in a Year or two he should dye an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious
Death upon the Cross. They
are therefore prepared for the Truth
by degrees. First, <hi>Iohn the Baptist</hi> tells
them, <hi>The Kingdom of God</hi> (a name
by which the Jews called the Kingdom
of the <hi>Messiah) is at hand.</hi> Then our
Saviour comes, and he tells them <hi>of
the Kingdom of God;</hi> Sometimes that it
is at hand, and upon some occasions,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60354:80"/>
that it is come; but says in his Publick
Preaching little or nothing of himself.
Then come the Apostles and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
after his Death, and they in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
words teach what his Birth, Life,
and Doctrine had done before, and had
prepared the well-disposed to receive;
<hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Iesus is the Messiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this Design and Method of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
the Gospel, was the choice of
the Apostles exactly adjusted; A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Poor, Ignorant, Illiterate Men;
who, as Christ himself tells us, <hi>Mat.</hi> XI.
25. and <hi>Luke</hi> X. 21. Were not of the
<hi>Wise and Prudent</hi> Men of the World:
They were, in that respect, but meer
Children. These, convinced by the
Miracles they saw him daily do, and
the unblameable Life he lead, might be
disposed to believe him to be the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah:</hi>
And though they with others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
a Temporal Kingdom on Earth,
might yet rest satisfied in the truth of
their Master (who had honoured them
with being near his Person) that it
would come, without being too inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
after the time, manner, or seat
of his Kingdom; As men of Letters,
more studied in their Rabbins, or men
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60354:80"/>
of Business, more versed in the World,
would have been forward to have been.
Men great, or wise, in Knowledge or
ways of the World, would hardly have
been kept from prying more narrowly
into his Design and Conduct; Or from
questioning him about the ways and
measures he would take, for ascending
the Throne; and what means were to
be used towards it, and when they should
in earnest set about it. Abler men, of
higher Births or Thoughts, would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have been hindred from whispering,
at least to their Friends and Relations,
that their Master was the <hi>Messiah;</hi> And
that though he concealed himself to a
fit Opportunity, and till things were
ripe for it, yet they should ere long see
him break out of his Obscurity, cast
off the Cloud, and declare himself, as
he was, King of <hi>Israel.</hi> But the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and lowness of these good poor
men made them of another temper.
They went along in an implicite trust
on him, punctually keeping to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and not exceeding his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
When he sent them to Preach the
Gospel, He bid them Preach <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God</hi> to be at hand; And that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:60354:81"/>
they did, without being more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
than he had ordered; or mixing
their own Prudence with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
to promote the Kingdom of the
<hi>Messiah.</hi> They preached it, without
giving, or so much as intimating that
their Master was he: Which men of
another Condition, and an higher Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
would scarce have forborn to
have done. When he asked them, who
they thought him to be; And <hi>Peter</hi>
answered, <hi>The Messiah, the Son of God,
Mat.</hi> XVI. 16. He plainly shews, by
the following words, that he himself
had not told them so; And at the same
time, v. 20. forbids them to tell this
their Opinion of him, to any body.
How obedient they were to him in
this, we may not only conclude from
the silence of the Evangelists concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any such thing, published by them
any where before his Death; but from
the exact Obedience three of them paid
to a like Command of his. He takes
<hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> into a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
And there <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> coming
to him, he is transfigured before them:
<hi>Mat.</hi> XVII. 9. He charges them, saying;
<hi>See that ye tell no man what you have
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60354:81"/>
seen, till the Son of Man shall be risen
from the dead.</hi> And St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us,
what punctual Observers they were of
his Orders in this case: <hi>Chap.</hi> IX. 36.
<hi>They kept it close, and told no man, in
those days, any of those things which they
had seen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether twelve other men, of quicker
Parts, and of a Station or Breeding
which might have given them any O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of themselves, or their own A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities;
would have been so easily kept
from medling beyond just what was
prescribed them, in a matter they had
so much Interest in; and have said no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of what they might in Humane
Prudence have thought would have
contributed to their Master's Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and made way for his advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to his Kingdom; I leave to be
considered. And it may suggest mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Meditation, whether St. <hi>Paul</hi>
was not for this reason, by his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Parts, and warmer Temper, better
fitted for an Apostle after, than during
our Saviour's Ministry: And therefore,
though a chosen Vessel, was not by the
Divine Wisdom called till after Christ's
Resurrection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:60354:82"/>
I offer this only as a Subject of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
the Admirable Contrivance of
the Divine Wisdom, in the whole Work
of our Redemption, as far as we are
able to trace it by the foot-steps which
God hath made visible to Humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
For though it be as easie to Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent
Power to do all things by an
immediate over-ruling Will; and so to
make any Instruments work, even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their Nature, in subserviency
to his ends; Yet his Wisdom is not
usually at the expence of Miracles (if
I may so say) but only in cases that
require them, for the evidencing of
some Revelation or Mission to be from
him. He does constantly (unless where
the confirmation of some Truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
it otherwise) bring about his
Purposes by means operating according
to their Natures. If it were not so,
the course and evidence of things would
be confounded; Miracles would lose
their name and force, and there could
be no distinction between Natural and
Supernatural.</p>
            <p>There had been no room left to see
and admire the Wisdom, as well as Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
of our Saviour; if he had rashly
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:60354:82"/>
every where exposed himself to the
Fury of the Jews, and had always been
preserved by a miraculous suspension of
their Malice, or a miraculous rescuing
him out of their Hands. It was enough
for him once to escape from the men
of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> who were going to throw
him down a Precipice, for him never
to Preach to them again. Our Saviour
had multitudes that followed him for
the Loaves; Who barely seeing the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
that he did, would have made
him King. If to the Miracles he did,
he had openly added in express words,
that he was the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and the King
they expected to deliver them; he would
have had more Followers, and warmer
in the Cause, and readier to set him up
at the Head of a Tumult. These in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
God, by a miraculous Influence,
might have hundred from any such At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt:
But then Posterity could not
have believed that the Nation of the
<hi>Iews</hi> did at that time expect the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
their King and Deliverer; Or that <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
who declared himself to be that
King and Deliverer, shewed any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
amongst them, to convince them
of it; Or did any thing worthy to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60354:83"/>
make him be credited or received. If
he had gone about Preaching to the
multitude which he drew after him,
that he was the <hi>Messiah, the King of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;</hi>
and this had been evidenced to
<hi>Pilate;</hi> God could indeed, by a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Influence upon his mind, have
made <hi>Pilate</hi> pronounce him Innocent;
And not Condemn Him as a Malefactor,
Who had openly, for three Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
preached Sedition to the People,
and endeavoured to perswade them that
he was the <hi>Messiah their King,</hi> of the
Blood-Royal of <hi>David,</hi> come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
them. But then I ask, whether
Posterity would not either have suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
the Story, or that some Art had
been used to gain that Testimony from
<hi>Pilate?</hi> Because he could not (for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing)
have been so favourable to <hi>Iesus,</hi>
as to be willing to release so Turbulent
and Seditious a Man; to declare him In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent;
and cast the blame and guilt of
his Death, as unjust, upon the Envy of
the Jews.</p>
            <p>But now the Malice of the Chief
Priests, Scribes, and Pharisees; the
Headiness of the Mob, animated with
hopes, and raised with miracles; <hi>Iudas</hi>'s
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60354:83"/>
Treachery, and <hi>Pilate</hi>'s care of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and the Peace of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
all working Naturally as they
should; <hi>Iesus,</hi> by the admirable wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Carriage, and an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Wisdom visible in his whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
weathers all these Difficulties,
does the Work he comes for, uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptedly
goes about Preaching his full
appointed time, sufficiently manifests
himself to be the <hi>Messiah</hi> in all the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
the Scriptures had foretold of
him; And when his hour is come, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
Death; But is acknowledged both
by <hi>Iudas</hi> that betrayed, and <hi>Pilate</hi> that
condemned him, to dye innocent. For,
to use his own words, <hi>Luke</hi> XXIV. 46.
<hi>Thus it is written, and thus it behooved
the Messiah to suffer.</hi> And of his whole
Conduct, we have a Reason and clear
Resolution in those words to St. <hi>Peter,
Mat.</hi> XXVI. 53. <hi>Thinkest thou that I
cannot now pray to my Father, and he
shall presently give me more than twelve
Legions of Angels? But how then shall
the Scripture be fulfilled, that thus it
must be?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having this clue to guide us, let us
now observe how our Saviour's Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60354:84"/>
and Conduct comported with it, in
the last Scene of his Life. How cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
he has been in the former part of
his Ministry, we have already observed.
We never find him to use the Name of
the <hi>Messiah</hi> but once, till he now came
to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> this last Passover. Before
this, his Preaching and Miracles were
less at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> (where he used to
make but very short stays) than any
where else. But now he comes six
days before the Feast, and is every day
in the Temple Teaching; And there
publickly heals the Blind and the Lame,
in the presence of the <hi>Scribes, Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees,</hi>
and <hi>Chief Priests.</hi> The time of
his Ministry drawing to an end, and
his hour coming, he cared not how
much the Chief Priests, Elders, Rulers,
and the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> were provoked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him by his Doctrine and Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;
He was as open and bold in his
Preaching and doing the Works of the
<hi>Messiah</hi> now at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and in the
sight of the Rulers, and of all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as he had been before cautious and
reserved there, and careful to be little
taken notice of in that place, and not
to come in their way more than needs.

All now that he took care of, was, not
what they should think of him, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
against him, (for he knew they
would seize him) But to say or do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that might be a just matter of
Accusation against him, or render him
Criminal to the Governour. But as
for the Grandees of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation,
he spares them not, but sharply now
reprehends their miscarriages publickly
in the Temple; where he calls them,

there fore-telling the Destruction of it;
His Disciples ask him, <hi>Mat.</hi> XXIV. 3,
<hi>&amp;c. When it should be, and what should
be the signs of his coming?</hi> He says to
them, <hi>Take heed that no man deceive
you: For many shall come in my Name;
i. e.</hi> taking on them the Name and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> which is only mine;
saying, <hi>I am the Messiah, and shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
many.</hi> But be not you by them
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60354:85"/>
mislead, nor by Persecution driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from this Fundamental Truth,
That I am the <hi>Messiah; For many shall
be scandalized,</hi> and Apostatize, <hi>but he
that endures to the end, the same shall
be saved: And this Gospel of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
shall be preached in all the World:
i e.</hi> The good News of me, the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi>
and my Kingdom, shall be spread
through the World. This was the great
and only Point of Belief they were
warned to stick to; And this is incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
again, <hi>v.</hi> 23-26. and <hi>Mark</hi> XIII.
21-23. with this Emphatical Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to them in both these Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,
<hi>Behold, I have told you before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand;</hi>
remember ye are fore-warned.</p>
            <p>This was in his Answer to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Enquiry concerning his <hi>Coming,
and the end of the World, v.</hi> 3. For so
we translate <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
We must understand the Disciples here
to put their Question, according to the
Notion and way of speaking of the
<hi>Iews.</hi> For they had two <hi>Worlds,</hi> as
we translate it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
The <hi>present World,</hi> and the <hi>World
to come.</hi> The Kingdom of God, as
they called it, or the time of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:60354:85"/>
they called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the
World to come,</hi> which they believed
was to put an end to <hi>this World:</hi> And
that then the Just should be raised from
the Dead; to enjoy, in that <hi>new World,</hi>
a Happy Eternity, with those of the
Jewish Nation who should be then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
            <p>These two things, <hi>viz.</hi> The visible
and powerful appearance of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and the end of the World, being
confounded in the Apostles Question,
Our Saviour does not separate them,
nor distinctly reply to them apart;
But leaving the Enquirers in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Opinion, answers at once concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his coming to take Vengeance of
the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation, and put an end to
their Church, Worship, and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
Which was their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
which they counted should last till the
<hi>Messiah</hi> came: And so it did, and then
had en end put to it. And to this he
joyns his last coming to Judgment, in
the Glory of his Father, to put a final
end to this World, and all the Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
belonging to the Posterity of
<hi>Adam</hi> upon Earth. This joyning them
together, made his Answer obscure, and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60354:86"/>
hard to be understood by them then;
Nor was it safe for him to speak plainer
of his Kingdom, and the Destruction
of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> unless he had a mind to
be accused for having Designs against
the Government. For <hi>Iudas</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them: And whether no other
but his Apostles were comprehended
under the name of <hi>his Disciples,</hi> who
were with him at this time, one cannot
determine. Our Saviour therefore speaks
of his Kingdom in no other stile but
that which he had all along hitherto
used, <hi>viz. The Kingdom of God;</hi> Luke
XXI. 31. <hi>When you see these things come
to pass, know ye that the Kingdom of
God is nigh at hand.</hi> And continuing
on his Discourse with them, he has the
same Expression, <hi>Mat.</hi> XXV. 1. <hi>Then
the Kingdom of Heaven shall be like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ten Virgins.</hi> At the end of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Parable of the Talents, he adds,
<hi>v. 31. When the Son of Man shall come
in his Glory, and all the holy Angels with
him, then shall he sit upon the Throne of
his Glory, and before him shall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
all the Nations. And he shall
set the Sheep on his right hand, and the
Goats on his left. Then shall the KING
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60354:86"/>
say, &amp;c.</hi> Here he describes to his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
the appearance of his Kingdom,
wherein he will shew himself <hi>a King</hi> in
Glory upon his Throne; But this in
such a way, and so remote, and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible
to a Heathen Magistrate;
That if it had been alledged against
him, it would have seemed rather the
Dream of a crazy Brain, than the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
of an Ambitious or Dangerous
man designing against the Government:
The way of expressing what he meant,
being in the Prophetick stile; which is
seldom so plain, as to be understood,
till accomplished. 'Tis plain, that his
Disciples themselves comprehended not
what Kingdom he here spoke of, from
their Question to him after his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<hi>Wilt thou at this time restore
again the Kingdom to Israel?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having finished these Discourses, he
takes Order for the Passover, and eats
it with his Disciples; And at Supper
tells them, that one of them should
betray him: And adds, <hi>Iohn</hi> XIII. 19.
<hi>I tell it you now, before it come, that
when it is come to pass, you may know
that I am.</hi> He does not say out the
<hi>Messiah; Iudas</hi> should not have that to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60354:87"/>
say against him if he would; Though
that be the sense in which he uses this
Expression, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>I am,</hi> more than
once. And that this is the meaning of
it, is clear from <hi>Mark</hi> XII. 6. <hi>Luke</hi> XXI.
8. In both which Evangelists the words
are, <hi>For many shall come in my Name,
saying,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>I am:</hi> The meaning
whereof we shall find explained in the
parallel place of St. <hi>Matthew, Chap.</hi>
XXIV. 5. For many shall come in my
Name, saying, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>I am
the Messiah.</hi> Here in this place of <hi>Iohn</hi>
XIII. Jesus fore-tells what should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to him, <hi>viz.</hi> That he should be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
by <hi>Iudas;</hi> adding this Prediction
to the many other Particulars of his
Death and Suffering, which he had at
other times foretold to them. And
here he tells them the reason of these
his Predictions, <hi>viz.</hi> That afterwards
they might be a confirmation to their
Faith. And what was it that he would
have them believe, and be confirmed
in the belief of? Nothing but this,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that <hi>he was the Messiah.</hi> The
same reason he gives, <hi>Iohn</hi> XIII. 28. <hi>You
have heard, how I said unto you, I go
away, and come again unto you: And
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60354:87"/>
now I have told you before it come to
pass, that when it is come to pass, ye
might believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Iudas</hi> had left them, and was
gone out, he talks a little freer to them
of his Glory, and his Kingdom, than
ever he had done before. For now he
speaks plainly of himself, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<hi>Iohn</hi> XIII. 31. <hi>Therefore when he</hi>
[Judas] <hi>was gone out, Iesus said, Now
is the Son of Man glorified, and God is
also glorified in him. And if God be
glorified in him, God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shall also glorifie
him in himself, and shall straitway glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
him.</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi> XXII. 29. <hi>And I
will appoint unto you a Kingdom, as my
Father hath appointed unto me; that ye
may eat and drink with me at my Table
in my Kingdom.</hi> Though he has every
where all along through his Ministry
preached the <hi>Gospel of the Kingdom;</hi>
and nothing else but that and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and the Duties of a good Life;
Yet it has been always <hi>the Kingdom of
God,</hi> and <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> And
I do not remember, that any where, till
now, he uses any such expression, as
<hi>My Kingdom.</hi> But here now he speaks
in the first Person, <hi>I will appoint you a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60354:88"/>
Kingdom;</hi> And <hi>in my Kingdom:</hi> And
this we see is only to the Eleven, now
<hi>Iudas</hi> was gone from them.</p>
            <p>With these Eleven, whom he was
now just leaving, he has a long Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to comfort them for their loss
of him; And to prepare them for the
Persecution of the World; And to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
them to keep his Commandments,
and to love one another. And here
one may expect all the Articles of Faith
should be laid down plainly; if any
thing else were required of them to
believe, but what he had taught them,
and they believed already; <hi>viz. That he
was the Messiah,</hi> John XIV. 1. <hi>Ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in God, believe also in me.</hi> v. 29.
<hi>I have told you before it come to pass,
that when it is come to pass, ye may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi>
It is believing on him, without
any thing else. <hi>Iohn</hi> XVI. 31. <hi>Iesus
answered them, Do you now believe?</hi>
This was in Answer to their professing,
<hi>v 30. Now are we sure that thou knowest
all things, and needest not that any man
should ask thee: By this we believe that
thou comest forth from God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>John XVII. 20. <hi>Neither pray I for
these alone, but for them also which shall
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60354:88"/>
believe on me through their word.</hi> All
that is spoke of <hi>Believing,</hi> in this his
last Sermon to them, is only <hi>Believing
on him,</hi> or believing that <hi>He came from
God;</hi> Which was no other than belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him to be the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, <hi>Iohn</hi> XIV. 9. Our Saviour
tells <hi>Philip, He that hath seen me, hath
seen the Father.</hi> And adds, <hi>v. 10. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievest
thou not that I am in the Father,
and the Father in me? The words that
I speak unto you, I speak not of my self:
But the Father that dwelleth in me, he
doth the works.</hi> Which being in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to <hi>Philip</hi>'s words, <hi>v. 9. Shew us
the Father,</hi> seem to import thus much:
<hi>No man hath seen God at any time,</hi> he
is known only by his Works. And that
he is my Father, and I the Son of God,
<hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Messiah,</hi> you may know by the
Works I have done; Which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
I could do of my self, but by
the Union I have with God my Father.
For that by being <hi>in God,</hi> and <hi>God in him,</hi>
he signifies such an Union with God,
that God operates in and by him, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
not only by the words above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
out of <hi>v.</hi> 10. (which can scarce
otherwise be made coherent sense) but
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60354:89"/>
also from the same Phrase used again
by our Saviour presently after, <hi>v.</hi> 20.
<hi>At that day, viz.</hi> after his Resurrection,
when they should see him again, <hi>ye shall
know that I am in my Father, and you
in me, and I in you; i. e.</hi> By the works
I shall enable you to do, through a
Power I have received from the Father:
Which whoever sees me do, must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the Father to be in me; And
whoever sees you do, must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
me to be in you. And therefore
he says, <hi>v. 12. Verily, verily I say unto
you, He that believeth on me, the works
that I do shall he also do, because I go
unto my Father.</hi> Though I go away,
yet I shall be in you, who believe in
me; And ye shall be enabled to do Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
also for the carrying on of my
Kingdom, as I have done; That it may
be manifested to others that you are
sent by me, as I have evidenced to you
that I am sent by the Father. And
hence it is that he says, in the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
preceding <hi>v. 11. Believe me that
I am in the Father, and the Father in
me; If not, believe me for the sake of
the works themselves.</hi> Let the Works
that I have done convince you that I
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60354:89"/>
am sent by the Father; That he is with
me, and that I do nothing but by his
Will, and by vertue of the Union I
have with him; And that consequently
I am the <hi>Messiah,</hi> who am anointed,
sanctified, and separate by the Father
to the Work for which he hath sent
me.</p>
            <p>To confirm them in this Faith, and
to enable them to do such Works as he
had done, he promises them the Holy
Ghost, <hi>Iohn</hi> XIV. 25, 26. <hi>These things
I have said unto you, being yet present
with you.</hi> But when I am gone, <hi>the
Holy Ghost, the Paraclet</hi> (which may
signifie Monitor as well as Comfortor,
or Advocate) <hi>which the Father shall
send you in my Name, he shall shew you
all things, and bring to your remembrance
all things which I have said.</hi> So that
considering all that I have said, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it together, and comparing it with
what you shall see come to pass, you
may be more abundantly assured that
I am the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and fully comprehend
that I have done and suffered all things
foretold of the <hi>Messiah;</hi> and that were
to be accomplished and fulfilled by him,
according to the Scriptures. But be
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60354:90"/>
not filled with grief that I leave you;
<hi>Iohn</hi> XVI. 7. <hi>It is expedient for you
that I go away: For if I go not away, the
Paraclet will not come unto you.</hi> One
Reason why, if he went not away, the
Holy Ghost could not come, we may
gather from what has been observed
concerning the Prudent and wary car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of our Saviour all through his
Ministry, that he might not incur
Death with the least suspicion of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor:
And therefore though his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
believed him to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
yet they neither understood it so well,
nor were so well confirmed in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of it, as after that he being cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
and risen again, they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Holy Ghost; And with the
Gifts of the Holy Spirit, a fuller and
clearer Evidence and Knowledge that he
was the <hi>Messiah;</hi> And were enlightned
to see how his Kingdom was such as
the Scriptures foretold, though not such
as they, till then, had expected. And
now this Knowledge and Assurance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from the Holy Ghost, was of use
to them after his Resurrection; when
they could then boldly go about, and
openly Preach, as they did, that <hi>Iesus</hi>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:60354:90"/>
was the <hi>Messiah;</hi> confirming that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
by the Miracles which the Holy
Ghost impowered them to do. But
till he was dead and gone, they could
not do this. Their going about openly
Preaching, as they did after his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
that <hi>Iesus</hi> was the <hi>Messiah;</hi> and
doing Miracles every where to make it
good, would not have consisted with
that Character of Humility, Peace, and
Innocence, which the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to
sustain; if they had done it before his
Crucifixion. For this would have drawn
upon him the Condemnation of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor,
either as a stirrer of Sedition
against the Publick Peace; or as a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender
to the Kingdom of <hi>Israel.</hi> And
hence we see, that they who before his
Death preached only the <hi>Gospel of the
Kingdom;</hi> that <hi>the Kingdom of God was
at hand;</hi> As soon as they had received
the Holy Ghost after his Resurrection,
changed their stile, and every where
in express words declare that <hi>Iesus</hi> is
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> that <hi>King</hi> which was to
come. This, the following words here
in St. <hi>Iohn</hi> XVI. 8-14. confirm; Where
he goes on to tell them; <hi>And when he is
come, he will convince the World of Sin:
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60354:91"/>
Because they believed not on me.</hi> Your
Preaching then, accompanied with Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
by the assistance of the Holy
Ghost, shall be a Conviction to the
World that the <hi>Iews</hi> sinned in not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
me to be the <hi>Messiah. Of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi>
or Justice: <hi>Because I go to my
Father, and ye see me no more.</hi> By the
same Preaching and Miracles you shall
confirm the Doctrine of my Ascension;
and thereby convince the World that I
was that <hi>Iust One,</hi> who am therefore
ascended to the Father into Heaven,
where no unjust Person shall enter. <hi>Of
Iudgment: Because the Prince of this
World is judged.</hi> And by the same
assistance of the Holy Ghost ye shall
convince the World that the Devil is
judged or condemned, by your casting
of him out, and destroying his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and his Worship where ever you
Preach. Our Saviour adds, <hi>I have yet
many things to say unto you, but you
cannot bear them now.</hi> They were yet
so full of a Temporal Kingdom, that
they could not bear the discovery of
what a kind of Kingdom his was, nor
what a King he was to be; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he leaves them to the coming of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:60354:91"/>
the Holy Ghost, for a farther and fuller
discovery of himself, and the Kingdom
of the <hi>Messiah;</hi> For fear they should be
scandalized in him, and give up the
hopes they had now in him, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
him. This he tells them, <hi>v.</hi> 1. of
this XVI. Chapter: <hi>These things I have
said unto you, that you may not be scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized.</hi>
The last thing he had told
them before his saying this to them, we
find in the last Verses of the precedent
Chapter: <hi>When the Paraclet is come,
the Spirit of Truth, he shall witness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
me.</hi> He shall shew you who I
am, and witness it to the World; And
then <hi>Ye also shall bear witness, because
ye have been with me from the beginning.</hi>
He shall call to your mind what I have
said and done, that ye may understand
it, and know, and bear Witness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
me. And again here, <hi>Iohn</hi> XVI.
after he had told them, they could not
bear what he had more to say, he adds;
<hi>v. 13. Howbeit, when the Spirit of Truth
is come, he will guide you into all Truth;
and he will shew you things to come:
He shall glorifie me.</hi> By the Spirit,
when he comes, ye shall be fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
concerning me; And though
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60354:92"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

               </gap>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:60354:93"/>
you cannot yet, from what I have said
to you, clearly comprehend my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Glory; yet he shall make it
known to you wherein it consists: And
though I am now in a mean state, and
ready to be given up to Contempt,
Torment, and Death; So that ye know
not what to think of it; Yet the Spirit,
when he comes, <hi>shall glorifie me,</hi> and
fully satisfie you of my Power and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
And that I sit on the right hand
of God, to order all things for the good
and increase of it, till I come again at
the last day in fulness of Glory.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, the Apostles had a full and
clear sight and perswasion of this, after
they had received the Holy Ghost; And
they preached it every where boldly and
openly, without the least remainder of
doubt or uncertainty. But that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
him not, yet even so far as his
Death and Resurrection, is evident from
<hi>v.</hi> 17, 18. <hi>Then said some of the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
among themselves, What is this that
he saith unto us; A little while, and ye
shall not see me; And again, a little
while, and ye shall see me; and because
I go to the Father? They said therefore,
what is this that he saith, a little while?
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:60354:93"/>
We know not what he saith.</hi> Upon which
he goes on to Discourse to them of his
Death and Resurrection, and of the
Power they should have of doing Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles;
But all this he declares to them
in a Mystical and involved way of
speaking; as he tells them himself, <hi>v.</hi>
25. <hi>These things have I spoken to you in
Proverbs; i. e.</hi> In General, Obscure,
Aenigmatical, or Figurative terms. (All
which, as well as Allusive Apologues,
the Jews called Proverbs or Parables)
Hitherto my declaring of my self to
you hath been obscure, and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve;
And I have not spoken of my
self to you in plain and direct words,
because ye <hi>could not bear it.</hi> A <hi>Messiah,</hi>
and not a King, you could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand;
And a King living in Poverty
and Persecution, and dying the Death
of a Slave and Malefactor upon a Cross,
you could not put together. And had
I told you in plain words that I was the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> and given you a direct Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to Preach to others that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly
owned my self to be the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi>
you and they would have been
ready to have made a Commotion, to
have set me upon the Throne of my
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:60354:94"/>
Father <hi>David,</hi> and to fight for me, that
your <hi>Messiah,</hi> your King, in whom are
your hopes of a Kingdom, should not
be delivered up into the hands of his
Enemies, to be put to Death; And of
this, <hi>Peter</hi> will instantly give you an
Example. But <hi>the time cometh when I
shall no more speak unto you in Parables;
but I shall shew unto you plainly of the
Father.</hi> My Death and Resurrection,
and the coming of the Holy Ghost, will
speedily enlighten you, and then I shall
make you know the Will and Design
of the Father; What a Kingdom I am
to have, and by what means, and to
what end, <hi>v.</hi> 27. And this the Father
himself will shew unto you; <hi>For he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
you, because ye have loved me, and
have believed that I came out from the
Father;</hi> Because ye have believed that
I am the <hi>Son of God, the Messiah;</hi> That
he hath anointed and sent me; Though
it hath not been yet fully discovered to
you, what kind of Kingdom it shall
be, nor by what means brought about.
And then our Saviour, without being
asked, explaining to them what he had
said; And making them understand bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
what before they stuck at, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60354:94"/>
secretly among themselves that
they understood not; They thereupon
declare, <hi>v. 30. Now are we sure that
thou knowest all things, and needest not
that any man should ask thee.</hi> 'Tis
plain thou knowest mens Thoughts and
Doubts before they ask. <hi>By this we
believe that thou comest forth from God.
Iesus answered, Do ye now believe?</hi>
Notwithstanding that you now believe
that I came from God, and am the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi>
sent by him; <hi>Behold, the hour
cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall
be scattered;</hi> And as it is, <hi>Mat.</hi> XXVI.
31. and <hi>shall all be scandalized in me.</hi>
What it is to be scandalized in him, we
may see by what followed hereupon,
if that which he says to St. <hi>Peter, Mark</hi>
XIV. did not sufficiently explain it.</p>
            <p>This I have been the more particular
in; That it may be seen, that in this last
Discourse to his Disciples (where he
opened himself more than he had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
done; and where, if any thing
more was required to make them Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
than what they already believed,
we might have expected they should
have heard of it;) there were no new
Articles proposed to them, but what
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:60354:95"/>
they believed before, <hi>viz.</hi> That he was
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the Son of God, sent from
the Father; Though of his manner of
proceeding, and his sudden leaving the
World, and some few particulars, he
made them understand something more
than they did before. But as to the
main design of the Gospel, <hi>viz.</hi> That
he had a Kingdom, that he should be
put to Death, and rise again, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
into Heaven to his Father, and
come again in Glory to Judge the
World; This he had told them: And
so had acquainted them with the Great
Council of God, in sending him the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> and omitted nothing that was
necessary to be known or believed in
it. And so he tells them himself, <hi>Iohn</hi>
XV. 15. <hi>Henceforth I call ye not Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;
for the Servant knoweth not what
his Lord does: But I have called ye
Friends; for ALL THINGS I have
heard of my Father, I have made known
unto you;</hi> though perhaps ye do not so
fully comprehend them, as you will
shortly, when I am risen and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended.</p>
            <p>To conclude all, in his Prayer, which
shuts up this Discourse, he tells the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:60354:95"/>
Father what he had made known to his
Apostles; The Result whereof we have
<hi>Iohn</hi> XVII. 8. <hi>I have given unto them
the words which thou gavest me, and they
have received them, and THEY
HAVE BELIEVED THAT
THOV DIDST SEND ME:</hi>
Which is in effect, that he was the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi>
promised and sent by God. And
then he Prays for them, and adds, <hi>v.</hi> 20,
21. <hi>Neither pray I for these alone, but
for them also who shall believe on me
through their word.</hi> What that Word
was, through which others should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in him, we have seen in the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the Apostles all through the
History of the <hi>Acts, viz.</hi> This one great
Point, that Jesus was the <hi>Messiah.</hi> The
Apostles, he says, <hi>v. 25. know that thou
hast sent me; i. e.</hi> are assured that I am
the <hi>Messiah.</hi> And in <hi>v.</hi> 21. &amp; 23. he
Prays, <hi>That the World may believe</hi>
(which <hi>v.</hi> 23. is called knowing) <hi>that
thou hast sent me.</hi> So that what Christ
would have believed by his Disciples,
we may see by this his last Prayer for
them, when he was leaving the World,
as well as by what he Preached whilst
he was in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:60354:96"/>And as a Testimony of this, one of
his last Actions, even when he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Cross, was to confirm this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
by giving Salvation to one of
the Thieves that was crucified with
him, upon his Declaration that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
him to be the <hi>Messiah;</hi> For so
much the words of his Request impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
when he said, <hi>Remember me, Lord,
when thou comest into thy Kingdom,
Luke</hi> XXIII. 42. To which Jesus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
<hi>v. 43. Verily I say unto thee, to
day shalt thou be with me in Paridise.</hi>
An Expression very remarkable: For
as <hi>Adam,</hi> by sin, left <hi>Paradise; i. e.</hi> a
state of Happy Immortality; Here the
believing Thief, through his Faith in
<hi>Iesus</hi> the <hi>Messiah,</hi> is promised to be put
in Paradise, and so re-instated in an
Happy Immortality.</p>
            <p>Thus our Saviour ended his Life.
And what he did after his Resurrection,
St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, <hi>Acts</hi> I. 3. That he
shewed himself to the Apostles <hi>forty
days, speaking</hi> things <hi>concerning the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God.</hi> This was what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
preached in the whole Course of
his Ministry, before his Passion: And no
other Mysteries of Faith does he now
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:60354:96"/>
discover to them after his Resurrection.
All he says, is concerning the Kingdom
of God; And what it was he said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that, we shall see presently out
of the other Evangelists; having first
only taken notice, that when now they
asked him, <hi>v. 6. Lord, wilt thou at this
time restore again the Kingdom to</hi> Israel?
<hi>He said, unto them,</hi> v. 7. <hi>It is not for
you to know the Times, and the Seasons,
which the Father hath put in his own
power: But ye shall receive Power after
that the Holy Ghost is come upon you;
And ye shall be witnesses unto me unto
the utmost parts of the Earth.</hi> Their
great business was to be Witnesses to
<hi>Iesus,</hi> of his Life, Death, Resurrection,
and Ascension; which put together,
were undeniable Proofs of his being the
<hi>Messiah:</hi> Which was what they were to
Preach, and what he said to them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Kingdom of God; As will
appear by what is recorded of it in the
other Evangelists.</p>
            <p>The day of his Resurrection, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the two going to <hi>Emmaus, Luke</hi>
XXIV. They declare, <hi>v.</hi> 21. what his
Disciples Faith in him was: <hi>But we
trusted that it had been He which should
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60354:97"/>
have redeemed</hi> Israel; <hi>i.e.</hi> We believed
that he was the <hi>Messiah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> come to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Nation of the <hi>Iews.</hi> Upon this
<hi>Iesus</hi> tells them, they ought to believe
him to the <hi>Messiah,</hi> notwithstanding
what had happened; Nay, they ought
by his Suffering and Death to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in that Faith, that he was the
<hi>Messiah.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 26, 27. <hi>Beginning at</hi>
Moses <hi>and all the Prophets, he expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto them in all the Scriptures, the
things concerning himself;</hi> How <hi>that the
Messiah ought to have suffered these
things, and to have entred into his Glory.</hi>
Now he applies the Prophesies of the
<hi>Messiah</hi> to himself, which we read not
that he did ever do before his Passion.
And afterwards appearing to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<hi>Luke</hi> XXIV. 36. He said unto
them, <hi>v.</hi> 44-47. <hi>These words which I
spoke unto you while I was yet with you,
that all things must be fulfilled which
are written in the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and
in the Prophets, and in the Psalms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
me. Then opened he their Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings,
that they might understand
the Scripture, and said unto them; Thus
it is written, and thus it behoved the
Messiah to suffer, and to rise from the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:60354:97"/>
dead the third day; And that Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and Remission of Sins should be
preached in his Name among all Nations,
beginning at Ierusalem.</hi> Here we see
what it was he had preached to them,
though not in so plain open words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Crucifixion; And what it is he
now makes them understand; And what
it was that was to be preached to all
Nations, <hi>viz.</hi> That he was the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
that had suffered, and rose from the
Dead the third day, and fulfilled all
things that was written in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
concerning the <hi>Messiah;</hi> And
that those who believed this, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented,
should receive Remission of
their Sins through this Faith in him.
Or, as St. <hi>Mark</hi> has it, <hi>Chap.</hi> XVI. 15.
<hi>Go into all the World, and Preach the
Gospel to every Creature; He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth,
and is baptized, shall be saved;
But he that believeth not, shall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi>
v. 20. What the <hi>Gospel, or Good
News</hi> was, we have shewed already,
<hi>viz.</hi> The happy Tidings of the <hi>Messiah</hi>
being come. <hi>v.</hi> 20. And <hi>they went
forth and preached every where, the
Lord working with them, and confirming
the Word with signs following.</hi> What
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60354:98"/>
the <hi>Word</hi> was which they preached,
and the Lord confirmed with Miracles,
we have seen already out of the History
of their Acts; Having given an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their Preaching every where,
as it is recorded in the <hi>Acts,</hi> except
some few places, where the Kingdom
of the <hi>Messiah</hi> is mentioned under the
name of <hi>the Kingdom of God;</hi> Which I
forbore to set down, till I had made it
plain out of the Evangelists, that That
was no other but the Kingdom of the
<hi>Messiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be seasonable therefore now,
to add to those Sermons we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
seen of St. <hi>Paul</hi> (wherein he
preached no other Article of Faith, but
that <hi>Iesus was the Messiah,</hi> the King, who
being risen from the Dead, now Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and shall more publickly manifest
his Kingdom, in judging the World at
the last day) what farther is left upon
Record of his Preaching. <hi>Acts</hi> XIX.
8. At <hi>Ephesus,</hi> Paul <hi>went into the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,
and spake boldly for the space of
three months; disputing and perswading
concerning the Kingdom of God.</hi> And
<hi>Acts</hi> XX. 25. At <hi>Miletus</hi> he thus takes
leave of the Elders of <hi>Ephesus: And
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:60354:98"/>
now behold, I know that ye all among
whom I have gone Preaching the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God, shall see my face no more.</hi>
What this Preaching the Kingdom of
God was, he tells you, <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21. <hi>I have
kept nothing back from you, which was
profitable unto you, but have shewed you,
and have taught you publickly, and from
House to House; Testifying both to the
Iews, and to the Greeks, Repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, and Faith towards our Lord
Iesus Christ.</hi> And so again, <hi>Acts</hi> XXVIII.
23, 24. <hi>When they</hi> [the Jews at <hi>Rome</hi>]
<hi>had appointed him</hi> [Paul] <hi>a day, there
came many to him into his Lodging; To
whom he expounded and testified the
Kingdom of God; perswading them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Iesus, both out of the Law of</hi>
Moses, <hi>and out of the Prophets, from
Morning to Evening. And some belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the things which were spoken, and
some believed not.</hi> And the History of
the <hi>Acts</hi> is concluded with this Account
of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Preaching: <hi>And</hi> Paul
<hi>dwelt two whole years in his own hired
House, and received all that came in
unto him, Preaching the Kingdom of God,
and teaching those things which concern
the Lord Iesus the Messiah.</hi> We may
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60354:99"/>
therefore here apply the same Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
to the History of our Saviour, writ
by the Evangelists; And to the History
of the Apostles, writ in the <hi>Acts;</hi> which
St. <hi>Iohn</hi> does to his own Gospel, <hi>Chap.</hi>
XX. 30, 31. <hi>Many other signs did Iesus
before his Disciples;</hi> And in many other
places the Apostles preached the same
Doctrine, <hi>which are not written</hi> in these
Books; <hi>But these are written, that you
may believe that Iesus is the Messiah, the
Son of God; and that believing, you may
have life in his Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What St. <hi>Iohn</hi> thought necessary and
sufficient to be <hi>believed,</hi> for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Eternal Life, he here tells us. And
this, not in the first dawning of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel;
when, perhaps, some will be apt
to think less was required to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
than after the Doctrine of Faith,
and Mystery of Salvation, was more
fully explained, in the Epistles writ by
the Apostles. For it is to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> says this not as soon
as Christ was ascended; For these words,
with the rest of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Gospel, were
not written till many Years after not
only the other Gospels, and St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s
History of the <hi>Acts;</hi> but in all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60354:99"/>
after all the Epistles writ by the
other Apostles. So that above Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
Years after our Saviour's Passion;
(for so long after, both <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and
St. <hi>Ierome</hi> assure us this Gospel was
written) St. <hi>Iohn</hi> knew nothing else
required to be believed for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Life, but that <hi>Iesus is the Messiah,
the Son of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this, 'tis likely, it will be objected
by some, that to believe only that <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
of <hi>Nazareth</hi> is the <hi>Messiah,</hi> is but
an <hi>Historical,</hi> and not a Justifying or
Saving Faith.</p>
            <p>To which I Answer; That I allow to
the makers of Systems and their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
to invent and use what distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
they please; and to call things
by what names they think fit. But I
cannot allow to them, or to any man,
an Authority to make a Religion for
me, or to alter that which God hath
revealed. And if they please to call
the believing that which our Saviour
and his Apostles preached and proposed
alone to be believed, an <hi>Historical</hi> Faith;
they have their liberty. But they must
have a care how they deny it to be a
Justifying or Saving Faith, when our
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60354:100"/>
Saviour and his Apostles have declared
it so to be, and taught no other which
men should receive, and whereby they
should be made Believers unto Eternal
Life; Unless they can so far make bold
with our Saviour, for the sake of their
beloved Systems, as to say, that he
forgot what he came into the World
for; And that he and his Apostles did
not Instruct People right in the way
and Mysteries of Salvation. For that
this is the sole Doctrine pressed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to be believed in the whole te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of our Saviour's and his Apostles
Preaching, we have shewed through
the whole History of the Evangelists
and the <hi>Acts.</hi> And I challenge them
to shew that there was any other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
upon their assent to which, or
disbelief of it, men were pronounced
<hi>Believers,</hi> or Unbelievers; And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
received into the Church of
Christ, as Members of his Body, as far
as meer believing could make them so,
or else kept out of it. This was the
only Gospel-Article of Faith which was
preached to them. And if nothing
else was preached every where, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
Argument will hold against any
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:60354:100"/>
other Articles of Faith to be be believed
under the Gospel; <hi>Rom.</hi> X. 14. <hi>How
shall they believe that whereof they have
not heard?</hi> For to Preach any other
Doctrines necessary to be believed, we
do not find that any body was sent.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it will farther be urged,
That this is not a <hi>Saving Faith;</hi> Because
such a <hi>Faith</hi> as this the Devils may
have, and 'twas plain they had; For
they believed and declared <hi>Iesus</hi> to be
the <hi>Messiah.</hi> And St. <hi>Iames, Chap.</hi> II.
19. tells us, <hi>The Devils believe, and
tremble;</hi> And yet they shall not be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
To which I answer, 1. That they
could not be saved by any <hi>Faith,</hi> to
whom it was not proposed as a means
of Salvation, nor ever promised to be
counted for Righteousness. This was
an Act of Grace, shewn only to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
God dealt so favourably with
the Posterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> that if they
would believe <hi>Iesus</hi> to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
the promised King and Saviour; And
perform what other Conditions were
required of them by the Covenant of
Grace; God would Justifie them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of this Belief. He would account
this Faith to them for Righteousness,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:60354:101"/>
and look on it as making up the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of their Obedience; Which being
thus supplied by what was taken instead
of it, they were looked on as Just or
Righteous, and so inherited Eternal
Life. But this Favour shewn to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
was never offered to the fallen
Angels. They had no such Proposals
made to them: And therefore whatever
of this kind was proposed to men,
it availed them not, whatever they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of it. This Covenant of Grace
was never offered to them.</p>
            <p>2. I Answer; That though the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
believed, yet they could not be
saved by the Covenant of Grace; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they performed not the other
Condition required in it, altogether as
necessary to be performed as this of
Believing, and that is <hi>Repentance.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
is as absolute a Condition of
the Covenant of Grace, as Faith; and
as necessary to be performed as that.
<hi>Iohn the Baptist,</hi> who was to prepare
the way for the <hi>Messiah, Preached the
Baptism of Repentance for the remission of
sins,</hi> Mark 1. 4.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Iohn</hi> began his Preaching with
<hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60354:101"/>
at hand, Mat.</hi> III. 2. So did our Saviour
begin his, <hi>Mat.</hi> IV. 17. <hi>From that time
began Iesus to Preach, and to say, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
for the Kingdom of Heaven is at
hand.</hi> Or, as St. <hi>Mark</hi> has it in that
parallel place, <hi>Mark</hi> I. 14, 15. <hi>Now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that</hi> John <hi>was put in Prison, Iesus
came into</hi> Galilee, <hi>Preaching the Gospel
of the Kingdom of God, and saying; The
time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God
is at hand: Repent ye, and believe the
Gospel.</hi> This was not only the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his Preaching, but the sum of
all that he did Preach; <hi>viz.</hi> That men
should <hi>Repent,</hi> and believe the good Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
which he brought them; That
<hi>the time was fulfilled</hi> for the coming of
the <hi>Messiah.</hi> And this was what his
Apostles preached, when he sent them
out, <hi>Mark</hi> VI. 12. <hi>And they going out,
preached that men should Repent.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Jesus to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting,
were so Necessary and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
parts of the Covenant of Grace,
that one of them alone is often put for
both. For here St. <hi>Mark</hi> mentions no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but their Preaching <hi>Repentance;</hi>
as St. <hi>Luke,</hi> in the parallel place, <hi>Chap.</hi>
IX. 6. mentions nothing but their
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:60354:102"/>
               <hi>Evangelizing,</hi> or Preaching the Good
News of the Kingdom of the <hi>Messiah:</hi>
And St. <hi>Paul</hi> often in his Epistles puts
<hi>Faith</hi> for the whole Duty of a Christian.
But yet the tenour of the Gospel is what
Christ declares, <hi>Luke</hi> XII. 3. 5. <hi>Vnless
ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</hi>
And in the Parable of the Rich Man in
Hell, delivered by our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi>
XVI. <hi>Repentance</hi> alone is the means pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of avoiding that place of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>v.</hi> 30, 31. And what the tenor
of the Doctrine, which should be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
to the World, should be, He tells
his Apostles after his Resurrection, <hi>Luke</hi>
XXIV. 27. <hi>viz. That Repentance and
Remission of Sins should be preached in
his Name,</hi> who was the <hi>Messiah.</hi> And
accordingly, believing <hi>Iesus</hi> to be the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> and Repenting, was what the
Apostles preached. So <hi>Peter</hi> began,
<hi>Acts</hi> II. 38. <hi>Repent, and be baptized.</hi>
These two things were required for the
Remission of Sins, <hi>viz.</hi> Entring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the Kingdom of God; And own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and professing themselves the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of <hi>Iesus,</hi> whom they believed to
be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and received for their
Lord and King; For that was to <hi>be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60354:102"/>
in his Name:</hi> Baptism being an
initiating Ceremony known to the <hi>Iews,</hi>
whereby those, who leaving Heathenism,
and professing a submission to the Law
of <hi>Moses,</hi> were received into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
of <hi>Israel.</hi> And so it was
made use of by our Saviour, to be that
Solemn visible Act, whereby those who
believed him to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him as their King, and professed
Obedience to him, were admitted as
Subjects into his Kingdom: Which in
the Gospels is called the <hi>Kingdom of
God;</hi> And in the <hi>Acts</hi> and Epistles of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by another name, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The same St.</hi> Peter <hi>Preaches again to
the</hi> Iews, <hi>Acts</hi> III. 19. Repent, and be
converted, that your sins may be blotted
out.</p>
            <p>What this Repentance was; which
the New Covenant required as one of
the Conditions to be performed by all
those who should receive the Benefits
of that Covenant; is plain in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to be not only a sorrow for sins
past, but (what is a Natural consequence
of such sorrow, if it be real) a turning
from them, into a new and contrary
Life. And so they are joyned together,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:60354:103"/>
Acts III. 19. <hi>Repent and turn about;</hi>
Or, as we render it, be converted. And
<hi>Acts</hi> XXVI. <hi>Repent and turn to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And sometimes <hi>turning about</hi> is put
alone, to signifie Repentance, <hi>Mat.</hi> XIII.
15. <hi>Luke</hi> XXII. 32. Which in other
words is well expressed by <hi>Newness of
Life.</hi> For it being certain that he who
is really sorry for his sins, and abhors
them, will turn from them, and forsake
them; Either of these Acts, which have
so Natural a connexion one with the
other, may be, and is often put for both
together. Repentance is an hearty sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for our past misdeeds, and a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Resolution and Endeavour, to the
utmost of our power, to conform all
our Actions to the Law of God. So
that Repentance does not consist in one
single Act of sorrow (though that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the first and leading Act, gives de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination
to the whole) But in <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
works meet for Repentance,</hi> in a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Obedience to the Law of Christ,
the remainder of our Lives. This was
called for by <hi>Iohn the Baptist,</hi> the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
of Repentance, <hi>Mat.</hi> III. 8. <hi>Bring
forth fruits meet for Repentance.</hi> And
by St. <hi>Paul</hi> here, <hi>Acts</hi> XXVI. 20. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:60354:103"/>
and turn to God, and do works meet
for Repentance.</hi> There are works to
follow belonging to Repentance, as well
as sorrow for what is past.</p>
            <p>These two, Faith and Repentance;
<hi>i. e.</hi> believing Jesus to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
and a good Life; are the indispensible
Conditions of the New Covenant. The
Reasonableness, or rather Necessity of
which, (as the only Conditions requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the Covenant of Grace, to be
performed by all those who would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Eternal Life) that we may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
comprehend, we must a little look
back to what was said in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> being the Son of God; and
so St. <hi>Luke</hi> calls him, <hi>Chap.</hi> III. 38. had
this part also of the <hi>Likeness</hi> and <hi>Image</hi>
of his Father, <hi>viz.</hi> That he was Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal.
But <hi>Adam</hi> transgressing the
Command given him by his Heavenly
Father, incurred the Penalty, forfeited
that state of Immortality, and became
Mortal. After this, <hi>Adam</hi> begot Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
But they were <hi>in his own likeness,
after his own image;</hi> Mortal, like their
Father.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:60354:104"/>God nevertheless, out of his Infinite
Mercy, willing to bestow Eternal Life
on Mortal Men, sends Jesus Christ into
the World; Who being conceived in
the Womb of a Virgin (that had not
known Man) by the immediate Power
of God, was properly the Son of God;
According to what the Angel declared
to his Mother, <hi>Luke</hi> I. 30-35. <hi>The
Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the
Power of the Highest shall over shadow
thee: Therefore also that Holy Thing
which shall be born of thee, shall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
THE SON OF GOD.</hi> So that
being the Son of God, he was, like his
Father, <hi>Immortal.</hi> As he tells us, <hi>Iohn</hi>
V. 26. <hi>As the Father hath life in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
so hath be given to the Son to have
life in himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that Immortality is a part of
that <hi>Image,</hi> wherein these (who were
the immediate Sons of God, so as to
have no other Father) were made like
their Father, appears probable, not only
from the places in <hi>Genesis</hi> concerning
<hi>Adam,</hi> above taken notice of, but seems
to me also to be intimated in some Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
concerning <hi>Iesus,</hi> the Son of
God. In the New Testament, <hi>Col.</hi> I.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60354:104"/>
15. He is called <hi>the Image of the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
God. Invisible</hi> seems put in, to
obviate any gross Imagination, that he
(as Images use to do) represented God
in any corporeal or visible Resemblance.
And there is farther subjoyned, to lead
us into the meaning of it, <hi>The First-born
of every Creature;</hi> Which is far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
explained, <hi>v.</hi> 18. Where he is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>The First-born from the dead:</hi>
Thereby making out, and shewing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be the <hi>Image</hi> of the Invisible
God; That Death hath no power over
him: But being the Son of God, and
not having forfeited that Son-ship by
any Trangression, was the Heir of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life; As <hi>Adam</hi> should have been,
had he continued in his filial Duty. In
the same sense the Apostle seems to use
the word <hi>Image</hi> in other places, <hi>viz.
Rom.</hi> VIII. 29. <hi>Whom he did foreknow,
he also did predestinate to be conformed
to the Image of his Son, that he might be
the first-born among many Brethren.</hi> This
<hi>Image,</hi> to which they were conformed,
seems to be <hi>Immortality</hi> and Eternal
Life. For 'tis remarkable that in both
these places St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection;
And that Christ was <hi>The
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:60354:105"/>
First-born among many Brethren;</hi> He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by Birth the Son of God, and the
others only by Adoption, as we see in
this same Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 15-17. <hi>Ye have
received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby
we cry, Abba, Father: The Spirit it
self bearing witness with our Spirits that
we are the Children of God. And if
Children, then Heirs; And Ioynt-Heirs
with Christ: If so be that we suffer with
him, that we may also be glorified to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi>
And hence we see that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
vouchsafes to call those, who at
the Day of Judgment are through him
entring into Eternal Life, his <hi>Brethren;
Mat.</hi> XXV. 40. <hi>In as much as ye have
done it unto one of the least of these my
Brethren.</hi> And may we not in this
find a reason why God so frequently in
the New Testament, and so seldom, if
at all, in the Old, is mentioned under
the single Title of THE FATHER?
And therefore our Saviour says, <hi>Mat.</hi>
XI. <hi>No man knoweth the Father save
the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son
will reveal him.</hi> God has now a Son
again in the World, the First-born of
many Brethren, who all now, by the
Spirit of Adoption, can say, <hi>Abba,</hi>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:60354:105"/>
Father. And we by Adoption, being
for his sake made his Brethren, and the
Sons of God, come to share in that
Inheritance, which was his Natural
Right; he being by Birth the Son of
God: Which Inheritance is Eternal Life.
And again, <hi>v. 23. We groan within our
selves, waiting for the Adoption, to wit,
the Redemption of our Body;</hi> Whereby
is plainly meant the change of these
frail Mortal Bodies, into the Spiritual
Immortal Bodies at the Resurrection;
<hi>When this Mortal shall have put on Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XV. 54. Which in that
Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 42-44. he farther expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
thus: <hi>So also is the Resurrection of
the dead. It is sown in Corruption, it is
raised in Incorruption: It is sown in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shonour,
it is raised in Glory: It is sown
in Weakness, it is raised in Power: It
is sown a Natural Body, it is raised a
Spiritual Body, &amp;c.</hi> To which he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns,
<hi>v. 49. As we have born the Image
of the Earthy, (i. e.</hi> As we have been
Mortal, like Earthy <hi>Adam</hi> our Father,
from whom we are descended, when he
was turned out of Paradise) <hi>We shall
also bear the Image of the Heavenly;</hi>
Into whose Sonship and Inheritance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60354:106"/>
adopted, we shall, at the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
receive that <hi>Adoption</hi> we expect,
<hi>Even the Redemption of our Bodies;</hi>
And after his <hi>Image,</hi> which is the <hi>Image</hi>
of the Father, become Immortal. Hear
what he says himself, <hi>Luke</hi> XX. 35, 36.
<hi>They who shall be accounted worthy to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that World, and the Resurrection
from the Dead, neither marry, nor are
given in marriage. Neither can they
die any more; for they are equal unto
the Angels, and are the SONS OF
GOD, being the Sons of the Resurrection.</hi>
And he that shall read St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Acts</hi> XIII. 32, 33. will find that
the great Evidence that Jesus was the
<hi>Son of God,</hi> was his Resurrection. Then
the Image of his Father appeared in him,
when he visibly entred into the state of
Immortality. For thus the Apostle
reasons; <hi>We Preach to you, how that
the Promise which was made to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
God hath fulfilled the same unto
us, in that he hath raised up Iesus again;
As it is also written in the second Psalm,
Thou art my Son, this day have I begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This may serve a little to explain the
<hi>Immortality</hi> of the Sons of God, who
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:60354:106"/>
are in this like their Father, made after
his <hi>Image</hi> and Likeness. But that our
Saviour was so, he himself farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
<hi>Iohn</hi> X. 18. Where speaking of
his Life, he says, <hi>No one taketh it from
me, but I lay it down of my self: I have
power to lay it down, and I have power
to take it up again.</hi> Which he could
not have had, if he had been a Mortal
Man, the Son of a Man, of the Seed
of <hi>Adam;</hi> Or else had by any Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
forfeited his Life. For <hi>the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Sin is Death:</hi> And he that hath
incurred Death for his own Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
cannot lay down his Life for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as our Saviour professes he did.
For he was the Just One, <hi>Acts</hi> VII. 57.
and XII. 14. <hi>Who knew no sin. 2 Cor.</hi> V. 21.
<hi>Who did no sin, neither was guile found
in his mouth.</hi> And thus, <hi>As by Man
came Death, so by Man came the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the Dead. For as in</hi> Adam
<hi>all die, so in Christ shall all be made
alive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this laying down his Life for
others, our Saviour tells us, <hi>Iohn</hi> X. 17.
<hi>Therefore does my Father love me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I lay down my life, that I might
take it again.</hi> And this his Obedience
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:60354:107"/>
and Suffering was rewarded with a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
which, he tells us, <hi>Luke</hi> XXII.
<hi>His Father had appointed unto him;</hi>
And which, 'tis evident out of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
to the <hi>Hebrews, Chap.</hi> XII. 2. he
had a regard to in his Sufferings: <hi>Who
for the joy that was set before him, endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Cross, despising the shame, and
is set down at the right hand of the
Throne of God.</hi> Which Kingdom given
him upon this account of his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Suffering, and Death, He himself
takes notice of, in these words, <hi>Iohn</hi>
XVII. 1-4. <hi>Iesus lift up his eyes to
Heaven, and said, Father, the hour is
come, glorifie thy Son, that thy Son also
may glorifie thee. As thou hast given
him power over all flesh, that he should
give Eternal Life to as many as thou hast
given him. And this is Life Eternal,
that they may know thee the only true
God, and Iesus the Messiah, whom thou
hast sent. I have glorified thee on Earth:
I have finished the work which thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
me to do.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his
Epistle to the <hi>Philippians, Chap.</hi> II. 8-11.
<hi>He humbled himself, and became obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
unto Death, even the death of the
Cross. Wherefore God also hath highly
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:60354:107"/>
exalted him, and given him a name that
is above every name: That at the name
of Iesus every knee should bow, of things
in Heaven, and things in Earth, and
things under the Earth; And that every
Tongue should confess that Iesus Christ is
Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus God, we see, designed his Son
<hi>Christ Iesus</hi> a Kingdom, an Everlasting
Kingdom in Heaven. But <hi>Though as
in</hi> Adam <hi>all die, so in Christ all shall
be made alive;</hi> And all men shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to Life again at the last day; Yet
all men having sinned, and thereby
<hi>come short of the Glory of God,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
assures us, <hi>Rom.</hi> III. 23. (<hi>i.e.</hi> Not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to the Heavenly Kingdom of
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> which is often called the
Glory of God; as may be seen, <hi>Rom.</hi> V.
2. &amp; XV. 7. &amp; II. 7. <hi>Mat.</hi> XVI. 27.
<hi>Mark</hi> VIII. 38. For no one who is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous,
<hi>i. e.</hi> comes short of perfect
Righteousness, shall be admitted into
the Eternal Life of that Kingdom; As
is declared, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> VI. 9. <hi>The unrighteous
shall not inherit the Kingdom of God;</hi>)
And Death, the Wages of Sin, being
the Portion of all those who had trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed
the Righteous Law of God; The
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60354:108"/>
Son of God would in vain have come
into the World, to lay the Foundations
of a Kingdom, and gather together a
select People out of the World, if, (they
being found guilty at their appearance
before the Judgment-seat of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Judge of all men at the last day)
instead of entrance into Eternal Life in
the Kingdom he had prepared for them,
they should receive Death, the just Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of Sin, which every one of them
was guilty of. This second Death would
have left him no Subjects; And instead
of those Ten Thousand times Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
and Thousands of Thousands,
there would not have been one left him
to sing Praises unto his Name, saying,
<hi>Blessing, and Honour and Glory, and Power,
be unto him that sitteth on the Throne,
and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</hi>
God therefore, out of his Mercy to
Mankind, and for the erecting of the
Kingdom of his Son, and furnishing it
with Subjects out of every Kindred,
and Tongue, and People, and Nation,
proposed to the Children of Men, that
as many of them as would believe <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
his Son (whom he sent into the
World) to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the promised
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:60354:108"/>
Deliverer; And would receive him for
their King and Ruler; should have all
their past Sins, Disobedience, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
forgiven them: And if for the
future they lived in a sincere Obedience
to his Law, to the utmost of their
power; the sins of Humane Frailty for
the time to come, as well as all those
of their past Lives, should, for his Son's
sake, because they gave themselves
up to him to be his Subjects, be
forgiven them: And so their Faith,
which made them be baptized into his
Name; (<hi>i.e.</hi> Enroll themselves in the
Kingdom of <hi>Iesus</hi> the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
themselves his Subjects, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
live by the Laws of his
Kingdom) should be accounted to them
for Righteousness; <hi>i.e.</hi> Should supply
the defects of a scanty Obedience in
the sight of God; Who counting this
Faith to them for Righteousness, or
Compleat Obedience, did thus Justifie,
or make them Just, and thereby capable
of Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>Now, that this is the Faith for which
God of his free Grace Justifies sinful
Man; (For <hi>'tis God alone that justifieth,
Rom.</hi> VIII. 33. <hi>Rom.</hi> III. 26.) We have
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:60354:109"/>
already shewed; by observing through
all the History of our Saviour and the
Apostles, recorded in the Evangelists,
and in the <hi>Acts,</hi> what he and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
preached and proposed to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.
We shall shew now, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
believing him to be the <hi>Messiah</hi>
their King, it was farther required, that
those who would have the Priviledge,
Advantages, and Deliverance of his
Kingdom, should enter themselves into
it; And by Baptism being made Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons,
and solemnly incorporated into
that Kingdom, live as became Subjects
obedient to the Laws of it. For if they
believed him to be the <hi>Messiah</hi> their
King, but would not obey his Laws,
and would not have him to Reign over
them, they were but greater Rebels;
and God would not Justifie them for a
Faith that did but increase their Guilt,
and oppose Diametrically the Kingdom
and Design of the <hi>Messiah; Who gave
himself for us, that he might redeem us
from all Iniquity, and purifie unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a peculiar People, zealous of good
works, Titus</hi> II. 14. And therefore St.
<hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Galatians,</hi> That that
which availeth is <hi>Faith;</hi> But <hi>Faith
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:60354:109"/>
working by Love.</hi> And that <hi>Faith</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Works, i.e.</hi> the Works of sincere
Obedience to the Law and Will of
Christ, is not sufficient for our Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
St. <hi>Iames</hi> shews at large, <hi>Chap.</hi> II.</p>
            <p>Neither indeed could it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
For Life, Eternal Life being the
Reward of Justice or Righteousness on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
appointed by the Righteous God
(who is of purer Eyes than to behold
Iniquity) to those only who had no
taint or infection of Sin upon them, it
is impossible that he should Justifie those
who had no regard to Justice at all,
whatever they believed. This would
have been to encourage Iniquity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Purity of his Nature; and
to have condemned that Eternal Law of
Right, which is Holy, Just, and Good;
Of which no one Precept or Rule is
abrogated or repealed; nor indeed can
be; whilst God is an Holy, Just, and
Righteous God, and Man a Rational
Creature. The Duties of that Law
arising from the Constitution of his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Nature, are of Eternal Obligation;
Nor can it be taken away or dispensed
with, without changing the Nature of
Things, overturning the measures of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:60354:110"/>
Right and Wrong, and thereby intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
and authorizing Irregularity,
Confusion, and Disorder in the World.
Which was not the end for which Christ
came into the World; But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
to reform the corrupt state of
degenerate Man; And out of those who
would mend their Lives, and bring forth
Fruit meet for Repentance, erect a new
Kingdom.</p>
            <p>This is the Law of that Kingdom,
as well as of all Mankind; And that
Law by which all Men shall be judged
at the last day. Only those who have
believed <hi>Iesus</hi> to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and
have taken him to be their King, with
a sincere Endeavour after Righteousness,
in obeying his Law, shall have their
past sins not imputed to them; And
shall have that Faith taken instead of
Obedience; Where Frailty and Weakness
made them transgress, and sin prevailed
after Conversion in those who hunger
and thirst after Righteousness (or perfect
Obedience) and do not allow themselves
in Acts of Disobedience and Rebellion,
against the Laws of that Kingdom they
are entred into.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:60354:110"/>He did not expect, 'tis true, a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Obedience void of all slips and falls:
He knew our Make, and the weakness
of our Constitutions too well, and was
sent with a Supply for that Defect.
Besides, perfect Obedience was the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of the Law of Works; and
then the Reward would be of Debt, and
not of Grace; And to such there was
no need of Faith to be imputed to them
for Righteousness. They stood upon
their own legs, were Just already, and
needed no allowance to be made them
for believing Jesus to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
taking him for their King, and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Subjects. But whether Christ
does not require Obedience, sincere
Obedience, is evident from the Laws
he himself pronounces (unless he can
be supposed to give and inculcate Laws
only to have them disobeyed) and
from the Sentence he will pass when he
comes to Judge.</p>
            <p>The Faith required was, to believe
<hi>Iesus</hi> to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the Anointed;
who had been promised by God to the
World. Amongst the <hi>Iews</hi> (to whom
the Promises and Prophesies of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi>
were more immediately delivered)
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:60354:111"/>
Anointing was used to three sorts of
Persons, at their Inauguration; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they were set apart to three great
Offices; <hi>viz.</hi> Of Priests, Prophets, and
Kings. Though these three Offices be
in Holy Writ attributed to our Saviour,
yet I do not remember that he any
where assumes to himself the Title of
a Priest, or mentions any thing rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to his Priesthood: Nor does he
speak of his being a Prophet but very
sparingly, and once or twice, as it were,
by the by: But the Gospel, or the
Good News of the Kingdom of the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> is what he Preaches every
where, and makes it his great business
to publish to the World. This he did,
not only as most agreeable to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of the <hi>Iews,</hi> who looked for
their <hi>Messiah,</hi> chiefly as coming in Power
to be their King and Deliverer; But as
it best answered the chief end of his
Coming, which was to be a King, and
as such to be received by those who
would be his Subjects in the Kingdom
which he came to erect. And though
he took not directly on himself the
Title of King till he was in Custody,
and in the hands of <hi>Pilate;</hi> yet 'tis plain,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:60354:111"/>
               <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>King of Israel,</hi> were the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
and received Titles of the <hi>Messiah.</hi>

22. <hi>Mat.</hi> XXVII. 42.</p>
            <p>What those were to do, who belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and received
him for their King, that they might be
admitted to be partakers with him of
this Kingdom in Glory, we shall best
know by the Laws he gives them, and
requires them to obey; And by the
Sentence which he himself will give,
when, sitting on his Throne, they shall
all appear at his Tribunal, to receive
every one his Doom from the mouth
of this Righteous Judge of all Men.</p>
            <p>What he proposed to his Followers
to be believed, we have already seen;
by examining his, and his Apostles Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
step by step, all through the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of the four Evangelists, and the
<hi>Acts of the Apostles.</hi> The same Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
will best and plainest shew us,
whether he required of those who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60354:112"/>
him to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> any thing
besides that Faith, and what it was.
For he being a King, we shall see by
his Commands what he expects from
his Subjects: For if he did not expect
Obedience to them, his Commands
would be but meer Mockery; And if
there were no Punishment for the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors
of them, his Laws would not
be the Laws of a King, that had Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to Command, and Power to Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise
the disobedient; But empty Talk,
without Force, and without Influence.</p>
            <p>We shall therefore from his Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
(if any such there be) see what
he has made Necessary to be performed,
by all those who shall be received into
Eternal Life in his Kingdom prepared in
the Heavens. And in this we cannot
be deceived. What we have from his
own Mouth, especially if repeated over
and over again, in different places and
expressions, will be past Doubt and
Controversie. I shall pass by all that is
said by St. <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> or any other,
before our Saviour's entry upon his
Ministry and Publick Promulgation of
the Laws of his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:60354:112"/>He began his Preaching with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to Repent; As St. <hi>Matt.</hi> tells us.
IV. 17. <hi>From that time Iesus began to
preach; saying, Repent, for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of heaven is at hand.</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi>
V. 32. he tells the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees,
<hi>I came not to call the righteous;</hi>
Those who were truly so, needed no
help, they had a right to the Tree of
Life, <hi>but sinners to Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Sermon, as he calls it, in the
Mount, <hi>Luke</hi> VI. and <hi>Matt.</hi> V, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He
commands they should be exemplary
in Good Works. <hi>Let your light so
shine amongst men, that they may see your
good works, and glorify your Father which
is in Heaven, Matt.</hi> V. 15. And that they
might know what he came for, and what
he expected of them, he tells them, <hi>v.</hi>
17-20. <hi>Think not that I am come to
dissolve</hi> or loosen <hi>the Law, or the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets:
I am not come to dissolve,</hi> or
loosen, but to <hi>make it full,</hi> or compleat;
By giving it you in its true and strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense.
Here we see he confirms, and
at once reinforces all the Moral Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
in the Old Testament. <hi>For veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I say to you, Till Heaven and Earth
pass, one jot or one tittle, shall in no wise
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:60354:113"/>
pass from the Law, till all be done. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
therefore shall break one of these
least Commandments, and shall teach men
so, he shall be called the least, (i. e.</hi> as it
is interpreted) Shall not be at all, <hi>in the
Kingdom of Heaven. V. 21. I say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, That except your Righteousness,
i. e.</hi> your Performance of the Eternal
Law of right, <hi>shall exceed the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye
shall in no case enter into the Kingdom
of Heaven:</hi> And then he goes on to
make good what he said, <hi>v. 17. viz.
That he was come to compleat the Law,
viz.</hi> By giving its full and clear sense,
free from the corrupt and loosning
glosses of the Scribes and Pharisees, <hi>v.</hi>
22-26. He tells them, That not only
Murder, but causeless Anger, and so
much as words of Contempt, were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.
He Commands them to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
and kind towards their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saires;
And that upon Pain of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.
In the following part of
his Sermon, which is to be read <hi>Luke</hi>
VI. and more at large, <hi>Matt.</hi> V, VI, VII.
He not only forbids actual Uncleanness,
but all irregular desires, upon pain of
Hell-fire; Causless Divorces; Swearing
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:60354:113"/>
in Conversation, as well as Forswearing
in Judgment; Revenge; Retaliation;
Ostentation of Charity, of Devotion,
and of Fasting; Repetitions in Prayer;
Covetousness; Worldly Care; Censori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness:
And on the other side, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
Loving our Enemies; Doing good
to those that Hate us; Blessing those that
Curse us; Praying for those that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spightfully use us; Patience, and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
under Injuries; Forgiveness; Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
Compassion: And closes all his
particular injunctions, with this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Golden Rule, <hi>Matt.</hi> VII. 12. <hi>All
things whatsoever ye would have that
Men should do to you, do ye even so to
them: For this is the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi>
And to shew how much he is
in earnest, and expects Obedience to
these Laws; He tells them <hi>Luke</hi> VI. 35.
That if they obey, <hi>Great shall be their
REWARD;</hi> they <hi>shall be called, The
Sons of the Highest.</hi> And to all this,
in the Conclusion, he adds this Solemn
Sanction; <hi>Why call ye me Lord, Lord,
and do not the things that I say?</hi> 'Tis
in vain for you to take me for the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi>
your King, unless you obey me.
<hi>Not every one who calls me Lord, Lord,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:60354:114"/>
shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi>
or be Sons of God; <hi>But he that does
the Will of my Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
To such Disobedient Subjects,
though they have Prophesied and done
Miracles in my Name, I shall say at
the day of Judgment; <hi>Depart from me
ye workers of Iniquity, I know you not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Matt.</hi> XII. he was told, That
his Mother and Brethren sought to
speak with him, <hi>v. 49. Stretching out
his hands to his Disciples, he said, Be
hold my Mother and my Brethren; For
whosoever shall do the Will of my Father,
who is in Heaven, he is my Brother, and
Sister, and Mother.</hi> They could not be
Children of the Adoption, and fellow
Heirs with him of Eternal Life, who did
not do the Will of his Heavenly Father.</p>
            <p>Matt. <hi>XV. and</hi> Mark. <hi>VI. The Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees
finding fault, that his Disciples
eat with unclean hands, he makes this
Declaration to his Apostles:</hi> Do ye not
perceive, that whatsoever from without
entreth into a man, cannot defile him;
because it enters not into his Heart, but
his Belly. That which cometh out of the
Man, that defileth the Man: For from
within, out of the Heart of Men, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:60354:114"/>
evil Thoughts, Adulteries, Fornicati-Murders,
Thefts, false Witnesses, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness,
Wickedness, Deceit, Lacivious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
an evil Eye, Blasphemy, Pride, Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishness.
All these ill things come from
within, and defile a Man.</p>
            <p>He commands Self-denial, and the
exposing our selves to Suffering and
Danger, rather than to deny or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own
him: And this upon pain of loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Souls; which are of more
worth than all the World. This we
may read, <hi>Matt.</hi> XVI. 24-27. and
the parallel places, <hi>Matt.</hi> VIII. and
<hi>Luke</hi> IX.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Apostles disputing amongst them,
who should be greatest in the Kingdom
of the</hi> Messiah, Matt. <hi>XVIII. 1. He thus
determines the Controversy:</hi> Mark. <hi>IX.</hi>
35. If any one will be first, let him be
last of all, and Servant of all; <hi>And set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a Child before them adds,</hi> Matt.
<hi>XVIII.</hi> 3. Verily I say unto you, Vnless
ye turn, and become as Children, ye shall
not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mat. XVIII.</hi> 15. If thy Brother shall
trespass against thee, go and tell him his
fault between thee and him alone: If he
shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:60354:115"/>
But if he will not hear thee, then
take with thee one or two more, that in
the mouth of two or three Witnesses every
word may be established. And if he shall
neglect to hear them, tell it to the Church:
But if he neglect to hear the Church,
let him be unto thee as an Heathen and
Publican. <hi>V. 21. Peter</hi> said, Lord, how
often shall my Brother sin against me, and
I forgive him? Till seven times? Iesus
said unto him, I say not unto thee, till
seven times; but until seventy times
seven. <hi>And then ends the Parable of
the Servant, who being himself for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given,
was rigorous to his Fellow-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
with these words;</hi> v. 34. And his
Lord was worth, and delivered him to the
Tormentors, till he should pay all that
was due unto him. So likewise shall my
Heavenly Father do also unto you, if you
from your hearts forgive not every one
his Brother their Trespasses.</p>
            <p>Luke <hi>X25. To the Lawyer, asking
him,</hi> What shall I do to inherit Eternal
Life? He said, What is written in the
Law? How readest thou? <hi>He answered,</hi>
Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and
with all thy strength, and with all thy
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:60354:115"/>
mind; And thy Neighbour as thy self.
<hi>Jesus said,</hi> This do, and thou shalt live.
<hi>And when the Lawyer, upon our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Parable of the good</hi> Samaritan,
<hi>was forced to confess, that he that
shewed Mercy, was his Neighbour;
Jesus dismissed him with this Charge,</hi>
v. 37. Go, and do thou likewise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luke XI.</hi> 41. Give Alms of such things
as ye have: Behold, all things are clean
unto you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luke XII.</hi> 15. Take heed, and beware
of Covetousness. <hi>V.</hi> 22. Be not sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
what ye shall eat, or what ye shall
drink, nor what ye shall put on; <hi>Be not
fearful, or apprehensive of want,</hi> For
it is your Father's pleasure to give you a
Kingdom. Sell that you have, and give
Alms: And provide your selves bags
that wax not old, and Treasure in the
Heavens that faileth not: For where
your Treasure is, there will your heart
be also. Let your loyns be girded, and
your lights burning; And ye your selves
like unto men that wait for the Lord,
when he will return. Blessed are those
Servants, whom the Lord when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
shall find watching. Blessed is that
Servant, whom the Lord having made
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:60354:116"/>
Ruler of his Houshold, to give them their
Portion of Meat in due season, the Lord,
when he cometh, shall find so doing. Of
a truth I say unto you, that he will make
him a Ruler over all that he hath. But
if that Servant say in his heart, my
Lord delayeth his coming; And shall
begin to beat the Men-servants, and
Maidens, and to eat and drink, and to
be drunken: The Lord of that Servant
will come in a day when he looketh not
for him, and at an hour when he is not
aware, and will cut him in sunder, and
will appoint him his Portion with Vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.
And that Servant who knew his
Lord's will, and prepared not himself,
neither did according to his will, shall
be beaten with many stripes. For he
that knew not, and did commit things
worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with
few stripes. For unto whomsoever much
is given, of him shall be much required:
And to whom men have committed much,
of him they will ask the more.</p>

               <hi>V.</hi> 12. When thou makest a Dinner or
Supper, call not thy Friends, or thy Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:60354:116"/>
neither thy Kinsmen, nor thy
Neighbours; lest they also bid thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and a recompence be made thee.
But when thou makest a Feast, call the
Poor and Maimed, the Lame, and the
Blind; And thou shalt be blessed: For
they cannot recompence thee: For thou
shalt be recompenced at the Resurrection
of the Iust.</p>

               <hi>Luke XVI.</hi> 9. I say unto you, make

Vnrighteousness; That when ye fail they
may receive you into Everlasting Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.
If ye have not been faithful
in the unrighteous Mammon, who will
commit to your trust the true Riches?
And if ye have not been faithful in that
which is another mans, who shall give you

               <hi>Luke XVII.</hi> 3. If thy Brother tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
against thee, rebuke him; And if he

against thee seven times in a day,
and seven times in a day turn again to

               <hi>Luke</hi> XVIII. 1. He spoke a Parable
to them, to this end, that men ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to pray, and not to faint.</p>
            <p>V. 18. <hi>One comes to him, and asks
him, saying, Master, what shall I do to
inherit Eternal Life? Iesus said to him,
If thou wilt enter into Life, keep the
Commandments. He says, Which? Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
said, Thou knowest the Commandments:
Thou shalt not Kill; Thou shalt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
Adultery; Thou shalt not Steal; Thou
shalt not bear false Witness; Defraud not;
Honour thy Father, and thy Mother;
And thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy
self. He said, All these have I obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from my Youth. Iesus hearing this,
loved him; and said unto him, Yet lackest
thou one thing: Sell all that thou hast,
and give it to the Poor, and thou shalt
have Treasure in Heaven; And come,
follow me.</hi> To understand this right,
we must take notice, that this Young
Man asks our Saviour, what he must
do, to be admitted effectually into the
Kingdom of the <hi>Messiah?</hi> The Jews be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
that when the <hi>Messiah</hi> came,
those of their Nation that received him,
should not die; But that they, with
those who being dead should then be
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:60354:117"/>
raised again by him, should enjoy Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life with him. Our Saviour, in
Answer to this Demand, tells the Young
Man, that to obtain the Eternal Life of
the Kingdom of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> he must
keep the Commandments. And then
enumerating several of the Precepts of
the Law, the Young Man says, he had
observed these from his Childhood. For
which, the Text tells us, Jesus loved
him. But our Saviour, to try whether
in earnest he believed him to be the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> and resolved to take him to be
his King, and to obey him as such, bids
him give all he has to the Poor, and
come, and follow him; and he should
have Treasure in Heaven. This I look
on to be the meaning of the place. This,
of selling all he had, and giving it to
the Poor, not being a standing Law of
his Kingdom; but a Probationary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to this Young Man; to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he truly believed him to be the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> and was ready to obey his
Commands, and relinquish all to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him, when he his Prince required
it.</p>
            <p>And therefore we see, <hi>Luke</hi> XIX. 14.
Where our Saviour takes notice of the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:60354:118"/>
Jews not receiving him as the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
he expresses it thou; <hi>We will not have
this man to Reign over us.</hi> 'Tis not
enough to believe him to be the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi>
unless we also obey his Laws, and
take him to be our King, to Reign o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us.</p>

               <hi>Mat.</hi> XXII. 11-13. He that had
not on the Wedding-Garment, though
he accepted of the Invitation, and came
to the Wedding, was cast into utter
Darkness. By the <hi>Wedding-Garment,</hi>
'tis evident Good Works are meant
here. That Wedding-Garment of fine
Linnen, clean and white, which we
are told, <hi>Rev.</hi> XIX. 8. is the <gap reason="foreign">

Or, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it, <hi>Ephes.</hi> IV. 1.
<hi>The walking worthy of the Vocation
wherewith we are called.</hi> This appears
from the Parable it self: <hi>The Kingdom
of Heaven,</hi> says our Saviour, <hi>v. 2. Is
like unto a King, who made a Marriage
for his Son.</hi> And here he distinguishes
those who were invited, into three sorts.
1. Those who were invited, and came
not; <hi>i.e.</hi> Those who had the Gospel,
the Good News of the Kingdom of God
proposed to them, but believed not.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:60354:118"/>
2. Those who came, but had not on a
Wedding-Garment; <hi>i.e.</hi> Believed <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> but were not
new clad (as I may so say) with a
true Repentance, and Amendment of
Life; Nor adorned with those Vertues,
which the Apostle, <hi>Col.</hi> III. requires to
be put on. 3. Those who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited,
did come, and had on the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-Garment;
<hi>i.e.</hi> Heard the Gospel,
believed <hi>Iesus</hi> to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and
sincerely obeyed his Laws. These
three sorts are plainly designed here;
whereof the last only were the Blessed,
who were to enjoy the Kingdom pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mat. XXIII.</hi> Be not ye called Rabbi:
For one is your Master, even the Messiah,
and ye all are Brethren. And call no
man your Father upon the Earth: For
one is your Father which is in Heaven.
Neither be ye called Masters: For one
is your Master, even the Messiah. But
he that is greatest amongst you, shall be
your Servant. And whosoever shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
himself, shall be abased; And he that
shall humble himself, shall be exalted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luke XXI.</hi> 34. Take beed to your
selves, lest your hearts be at any time
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:60354:119"/>
over-charged with surfeiting and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness,
and cares of this life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luke XXII.</hi> 25. He said unto them,
The Kings of the Gentiles exercise Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
over them; And they that exercise
Authority upon them, are called Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors.
But ye shall not be so. But
he that is greatest amongst you, let him
be as the younger; And he that is chief,
as he that doth serve.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John XIII.</hi> 34. A new Commandment
I give unto you, That ye love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
As I have loved you, that ye also
love one another. By this shall all men
know that ye are my Disciples, if ye love
one another. <hi>This Command, of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
one another, is repeated again,</hi>
Chap. XV. 12. &amp; 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John XIV.</hi> 15. If ye love me, keep
my Commandments. V. 21. He that
hath my Commandments, and keepeth
them, he it is that loveth me: And he
that loveth me, shall be loved of my
Father, and I will love him, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
my self to him. <hi>V.</hi> 23. If a man
loveth me, he will keep my words. <hi>V.</hi> 24.
He that loveth me not, keepeth not my
sayings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:60354:119"/>
               <hi>John XV.</hi> 8. In this is my Father
glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so
shall ye be my Disciples. <hi>V.</hi> 14. Ye are
my Friends, if ye do whatsoever I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
you.</p>
            <p>Thus we see our Saviour not only
confirmed the Moral Law; and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it from the corrupt glosses of the
Scribes and Pharisees, shewed the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as well as obligation of its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions;
But moreover, upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
requires the Obedience of his
Disciples to several of the Commands
he afresh lays upon them; With the
enforcement of unspeakable Rewards
and Punishments in another World, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Obedience, or Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
There is not, I think, any of
the Duties of Morality, which he has
not some where or other, by himself
and his Apostles, inculcated over and
over again to his Followers in express
terms. And is it for nothing, that he
is so instant with them to bring forth
Fruit? Does He their King Command,
and is it an indifferent thing? Or will
their Happiness or Misery not at all
depend upon it, whether they obey or
no? They were required to believe
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:60354:120"/>
him to be the <hi>Messiah;</hi> Which Faith is
of Grace promised to be reckoned to
them for the compleating of their
Righteousness, wherein it was defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive:
But Righteousness, or Obedience
to the Law of God, was their great
business; Which if they could have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by their own Performances,
there would have been no need of this
Gracious Allowance, in Reward of their
Faith: But Eternal Life, after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
had been their due by a
former Covenant, even that of Works;
the Rule whereof was never abolished,
though the Rigour were abated. The
Duties enjoyned in it were Duties still.
Their Obligations had never ceased;
nor a wilful neglect of them was ever
dispensed with. But their past Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions
were pardoned, to those who
received <hi>Iesus,</hi> the promised <hi>Messiah,</hi>
for their King; And their future slips
covered, if renouncing their former
Iniquities, they entred into his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and continued his Subjects, with
a steady Resolution and Endeavour to
obey his Laws. This Righteousness
therefore, a compleat Obedience and
freedom from Sin, are still sincerely to
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:60354:120"/>
be endeavoured after. And 'tis no where
promised, That those who persist in a
wilful Disobedience to his Laws, shall
be received into the eternal bliss of his
Kingdom, how much soever they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in him.</p>
            <p>A sincere Obedience, how can any one
doubt to be, or scruple to call, a Condition
of the New Covenant, as well as faith;
Whoever read our Saviour's Sermon in
the Mount, to omit all the rest? Can any
thing be more express than these words
of our Lord? <hi>Mat.</hi> VI. 14. <hi>If you forgive
Men their Trespasses, your Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will also forgive you: But if ye for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
not Men their Trespasses, neither
will your Father forgive your Trespasses.</hi>
And <hi>Ioh.</hi> XIII. 17. <hi>If ye know these
things, happy are ye if ye do them.</hi>
This is so indispensible a Condition of
the New Covenant, that believing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it will not do, nor be accepted; If
our Saviour knew the Terms on which
he would admit Men into Life. <hi>Why
call ye me Lord, Lord,</hi> says he, <hi>Luke</hi> VI.
46. <hi>and do not the things which I say?</hi>
It is not enough to believe him to be
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the <hi>Lord,</hi> without obeying
him. For that these he speaks to here,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:60354:121"/>
were Believers, is evident, from the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
place, <hi>Matt.</hi> VII. 21-23. where
it is thus Recorded: <hi>Not every one who
says Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
Kingdom of Heaven; but he that doth
the Will of my Father, which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
No Rebels, or Refractory Diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient,
shall be admitted there; though
they have so far believed in Jesus, as to
be able to do Miracles in his Name; As is
plain out of the following words. <hi>Many
will say to me in that day, Have we not
Prophesied in thy Name, and in thy
Name have cast out Devils; and in thy
Name have done many wonderful Works?
And then will I profess unto them, I never
knew you, depart from me ye workers of
iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This part of the New Covenant, the
Apostles also, in their Preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> ordinarily joined with
the Doctrine of Faith.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his first Sermon, <hi>Acts</hi> II.
when they were pricked in heart, and
asked, <hi>What shall we do?</hi> says, <hi>v.</hi> 38.
<hi>REPENT, and be Baptized, every
one of you, in the Name of Iesus Christ,
for the Remission of Sins.</hi> The same he
says to them again in his next Speech,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:60354:121"/>
               <hi>Acts</hi> IV. 26. <hi>Vnto you first, God having
raised up his Son Iesus, sent him to bless
you.</hi> How was this done? <hi>IN TVRN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING
AWAY EVERY ONE FROM
YOVR INIQVITIES.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The same Doctrine they Preach to
the High Priest and Rulers,</hi> Acts <hi>V.</hi> 30.
The God of our Fathers raised up Iesus,
whom ye slew and hanged on a Tree.
Him hath God Exalted with his right
hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour for
to give REPENTANCE to Israel, and
Forgiveness of Sins; And we are witnesses
of these things, and so is also the Holy
Ghost, whom God hath given to them that
obey him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Acts</hi> XVII. 30. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
That now under the Gospel, <hi>God
commandeth all Men every where to RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PENT.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Acts</hi> XX. 21. St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his last Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with the Elders of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
to have taught them the whole
Doctrine necessary to Salvation. <hi>I have,
says he, kept back nothing that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
unto you; But have shewed you,
and have taught you publickly, and from
house to house; Testifying both to the Iews
and to the Greeks:</hi> And then gives an
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:60354:122"/>
account what his Preaching had been,
<hi>viz. REPENTANCE towards God, and
Faith towards our Lord Iesus the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah.</hi>
This was the Sum and Substance
of the Gospel which St. <hi>Paul</hi> Preached;
and was all that he knew necessary to
Salvation; <hi>viz. Repentance, and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Iesus to be the Messiah:</hi> And so takes
his last farewel of them, whom he should
never see again, <hi>v.</hi> 32. in these words.
<hi>And now Brethren, I commend you to God,
and to the word of his Grace, which is
able to build you up, and to give you an
inheritance among all them that are san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.</hi>
There is an Inheritance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
by the Word and Covenant of
Grace; but it is only to those who are
<hi>Sanctified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Acts.</hi> XXIV. 24. <hi>When Felix sent for
Paul,</hi> that he and his Wife <hi>Drusilla</hi>
might hear him, <hi>concerning the Faith
in Christ;</hi> Paul reasoned of <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
or Justice, and <hi>Temperance;</hi> the
Duties we owe to others, and to our
selves; and of the Judgment to come;
Till he made <hi>Felix</hi> to tremble. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it appears, that <hi>Temperance and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi>
were Fundamental parts of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
that <hi>Paul</hi> professed, and were
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:60354:122"/>
contained in the Faith which he Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And if we find the Duties of the
Moral Law not pressed by him every
where; We must remember, That most
of his Sermons left upon Record, were
Preached in their Synagogues to the
Jews, who acknowledged their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
due to all the Precepts of the Law:
And would have taken it amiss to have
been suspected, not to have been more
Zealous for the Law than he. And
therefore it was with reason that his
Discourses were directed chiefly to
what they yet wanted, and were averse
to; the knowledge and imbracing of
Jesus their promised <hi>Messiah.</hi> But what
his Preaching generally was, if we will
believe him himself, we may see <hi>Acts</hi>
XXVI. Where giving an Account to
King <hi>Agrippa</hi> of his Life and Doctrine,
he tells him, <hi>v. 20. I shewed unto them
of Damascus, and at Ierusalem, and
throughout all the Coasts of Iudea, and
then to the Gentiles, that they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and turn to God, and do works meet
for Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we see, by the Preaching of
our Saviour and his Apostles, that he
required of those who believed him to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:60354:123"/>
be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and received him for
their Lord and Deliverer, that they
should live by his Laws: And that
(though in consideration of their becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Subjects, by Faith in him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they believed and took him to be
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> their former Sins should
be forgiven) Yet he would own none
to be his, nor receive them as true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizons
of the New <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> into the
inheritance of Eternal Life; but leave
them to the Condemnation of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous;
who renounced not their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Miscarriages, and lived in a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Obedience to his Commands. What
he expects from his Followers, he has
sufficiently declared as a Legislator. And
that they may not be deceived, by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staking
the Doctrine of Faith, Grace,
Free-Grace, and the Pardon and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
of Sins and Salvation by him,
(which was the great End of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
He more than once declares to
them; For what omissions and miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
he shall Judge and Condemn to
Death, even those who have owned
him, and done Miracles in his Name;
when he comes at last to render to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one according to what he hath
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:60354:123"/>
DONE in the Flesh; Sitting upon his
Great and Glorious Tribunal, at the
end of the World.</p>
            <p>The first place where we find our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
to have mentioned the day of
Judgment, is <hi>Ioh.</hi> V. 28, 29. in these
words; <hi>The hour is coming, in which all
that are in their Graves shall hear his</hi>
[i. e. the Son of God's] <hi>Voice, and shall
come forth; They that have DONE
GOOD unto the Resurrection of Life;
And they that have DONE EVIL, unto
the Resurrection of Damnation.</hi> That
which puts the distinction, if we will
believe our Saviour, is the having <hi>done
good or evil.</hi> And he gives a reason of
the necessity of his Judging or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
those <hi>who have done Evil,</hi> in
the following words; <hi>v. 30. I can of
my own self do nothing. As I hear
I judge; And my Iudgment is just: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I seek not my own Will, but the
Will of my Father who hath sent me.</hi>
He could not judge of himself; He had
but a delegated Power of Judging from
the Father, whose Will he obeyed in it,
and who was of purer Eyes than to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any unjust Person into the Kingdom
of Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:60354:124"/>
               <hi>Matt.</hi> VII. 22, 23. Speaking again of
that day, he tells what his Sentence will
be, <hi>depart from me ye WORKERS of
Iniquity.</hi> Faith in the Penitent and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
Obedient, supplies the defect of
their Performances; and so by Grace
they are made Just. But we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve;
None are Sentenced or Punished
for Unbelief; but only for their Misdeeds.
<hi>They are Workers of Iniquity</hi> on whom
the Sentence is Pronounced.</p>
            <p>Matt. <hi>XIII.</hi> 14. At the end of the
World, the Son of Man shall send forth
his Angels; And they shall gather out of
his Kingdom all Scandals, and them
which DO INIQVITY; And cast them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Furnace of Fire; There shall be wail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and gnashing of Teeth. <hi>And again,</hi>
v. 49. The Angels shall sever the WICK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED
from among the IVST; and shall
cast them into the Furnace of Fire.</p>
            <p>Matt. <hi>XVI.</hi> 24. For the Son of Man
shall come in the Glory of his Father, with
his Angels: And then be shall Reward eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Man according to his WORKS.</p>
            <p>Luke <hi>XIII.</hi> 26. Then shall ye begin
to say; We have eaten and drunk in thy
Presence, and thou hast taught in our
Streets. But he shall say, I tell you, I
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:60354:124"/>
know you not; Depart from me ye WOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KERS
of Iniquity.</p>
            <p>Matt. <hi>XXV.</hi> 21-26. When the Son
of Man shall come in his Glory; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him shall be gathered all Nations;
He shall set the Sheep on his right hand,
and the Goats on his Left: Then shall the
King say to them on his Right hand,
Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the
Kingdom prepared for you, from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the World; For, I was an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred,
and ye gave me Meat; I was thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
and ye gave me drink; I was a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and ye took me in; Naked, and ye
cloathed me; I was sick, and ye visited
me; I was in Prison, and ye came unto
me. Then shall the Righteous Answer
him, saying, Lord, When saw we thee an
hungred, and fed thee? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the
King shall answer, and say unto them;
Verily, I say unto you, In as much as ye
have done it unto one of the least of these
my Brethren, ye have done it unto me.
Then shall he say unto them on the left
hand, Depart from me, ye Cursed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
everlasting Fire, prepared for the
Devil and his Angels. For I was an
hungred, and ye gave me no meat; I
was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink;
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:60354:125"/>
I was a stranger, and ye took me not in;
Naked, and ye cloathed me not; Sick
and in prison, and ye visited me not.
In so much that ye did it not to one of
these, ye did it not to me. And these
shall go into Everlasting Punishment: But
the Righteous into Life Eternal.</p>
            <p>These, I think, are all the places
where our Saviour mentions the last
Judgment; or describes his way of
Proceeding in that Great Day: Wherein,
as we have observed, it is remarkable,
that every where the Sentence follows,
doing or not doing; without any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of believing, or not believing.
Not that any to whom the Gospel hath
been Preached, shall be Saved, without
believing <hi>Iesus</hi> to be the <hi>Messiah:</hi> For
all being Sinners, and Transgressors of
the Law, and so unjust; are all liable
to Condemnation; unless they believe,
and so through Grace are justified by
God for this Faith, which shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
to them for Righteousness. But
the rest wanting this Cover, this allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
for their Transgressions, must an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
for all their Actions: And being
found Transgressors of the Law, shall
by the Letter, and Sanction of that Law,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:60354:125"/>
be Condemned, for not having paid a
full Obedience to that Law: And not for
want of Faith. That is not the Guilt,
on which the Punishment is laid; though
it be the want of Faith, which lays open
their Guilt uncovered; And exposes
them to the Sentence of the Law, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all that are Unrighteous.</p>
            <p>The common Objection here, is; If
all Sinners shall be Condemned, but
such as have a gracious allowance made
them; And so are justified by God, for
believing <hi>Iesus</hi> to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and
so taking him for their King, whom
they are resolved to obey, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
of their Power; What shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of all Mankind, who lived before
our Saviour's time; Who never heard
of his Name; And consequently could
not believe in him? To this, the Answer
is so obvious and natural, that one
would wonder, how any reasonable Man
should think it worth the urging. No
body was, or can be, required to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
what was never proposed to him,
to believe. Before the Fulness of time,
which God from the Council of his
own Wisdom had appointed to send his
Son in; He had at several times, and in
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:60354:126"/>
rent Manners, promised to the People
of <hi>Israel,</hi> an extraordinary Person to
come; Who, raised from amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
should be their Ruler and Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.
The time; And other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of his Birth, Life, and Person;
he had in sundry Prophesies so particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
described, and so plainly foretold,
that He was well known, and expected
by the Jews; under the Name of the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> or Anointed, given him in
some of these Prophesies. All then that
was required before his appearing in
the World, was to believe what God
had revealed; And to rely with a full
assurance on God for the performance
of his Promise; And to believe, that
in due time he would send them the
<hi>Messiah;</hi> this anointed King; this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
Saviour, and Deliverer; according
to his Word. This Faith in the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of God; This relying and acquiescing
in his Word and Faithfulness; The Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
takes well at our hands, as a
great mark of homage, paid by us
poor frail Creatures, to his <hi>Goodness</hi> and
<hi>Truth,</hi> as well as to his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi>
And accepts it as an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his peculiar Providence, and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:60354:126"/>
Benignity to us. And therefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
tells us, <hi>Iohn</hi> XII. 44. <hi>He that
believes on me, believes not on me; But
on him that sent me.</hi> The works of
Nature shew his Wisdom and Power:
But 'tis his peculiar Care of Mankind,
most eminently discovered in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
to them, that shews his Bounty
and Goodness; And consequently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages
their Hearts in Love and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to him. This oblation of an
Heart, fixed with dependance and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
on him, is the most acceptable
Tribute we can pay him; the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of true Devotion; and Life of all
Religion. What a value he puts on
this depending on his Word, and rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
satisfied in his Promises, We have
an Example in <hi>Abraham;</hi> whose Faith
<hi>Was counted to him for Righteousness;</hi>
As we have before remarked out of
<hi>Rom.</hi> IV. And his relying firmly on
the Promise of God, without any
doubt of its performance; gave him
the Name, of the Father of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
And gained him so much favour
with the Almighty, that he was called
the <hi>Friend of God:</hi> The Highest and
most Glorious Title can be bestowed
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:60354:127"/>
on a Creature. The thing promised
was no more, but a Son by his Wife
<hi>Sarah;</hi> and a numerous Posterity by
him, which should possess the Land of
<hi>Canaan.</hi> These were but Temporal
Blessings; And (except the Birth of a
Son) very remote; Such as he should
never live to see, nor in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
have the benefit of. But because
he questioned not the Performance of
it; But rested fully satisfied in the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Truth, and Faithfulness of God
who had promised; it was counted to
him for Righteousness. Let us see how
St. <hi>Paul</hi> expresses it; <hi>Rom.</hi> IV. 18-22.
<hi>Who, against hope, believed in hope,
that he might become the Father of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Nations; According to that which
was spoken, so shall thy Seed be. And
being not weak in his Faith, he conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not his own Body now dead, when he
was above an hundred years old; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet the deadness of</hi> Sarah<hi>'s Womb.
He staggered not at the Promise of God
through unbelief, but was strong in Faith,
giving Glory to God; And being fully
perswaded, that what he had promised,
he was able to perform. And THERE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORE,
it was imputed to him for
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:60354:127"/>
Righteousness.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> having here
Emphatically described the strength and
firmness of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith, informs
us; That he thereby <hi>gave glory to God;</hi>
And therefore it was <hi>accounted to him
for Righteousness.</hi> This is the way that
God deals with poor frail Mortals. He
is graciously pleased to take it well of
them; And give it the place of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
and a kind of merit in his
sight; If they believe his Promises,
and have a steadfast relying on his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity
and goodness. St. <hi>Paul Heb.</hi>
XI. 6. tells us; <hi>Without Faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to please God:</hi> But at the same
time tells us what Faith that is. <hi>For,</hi>
says he, <hi>He that cometh to God, must
believe that he is; And that he is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder
of them that diligently seek
him.</hi> He must be perswaded of God's
Mercy and good Will to those, who
seek to obey him; And rest assured of
his rewarding those who rely on him,
for whatever, either by the light of
Nature, or particular Promises, he has
revealed to them of his tender Mercies;
and taught them to expect from his
Bounty. This description of <hi>Faith</hi> (that
we might not mistake what he means
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:60354:128"/>
by that <hi>Faith,</hi> without which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
please God, and which recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
the Saints of Old) St. <hi>Paul</hi>
places in the middle of the List of
those who were Eminent for their
<hi>Faith;</hi> And whom he sets as Patterns
to the converted <hi>Hebrews,</hi> under Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution;
to encourage them to persist
in their confidence of Deliverance by
the Coming of <hi>Iesus Christ;</hi> And in
their belief of the Promises they now
had under the Gospel: Not to <hi>draw back</hi>
from the Hope that was set before
them; Nor Apostatize from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the Christian Religion. This
is plain from <hi>v.</hi> 35-38. of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
Chapter: <hi>Cast not away there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your confidence, which hath great
recompence of Reward. For ye have
great need of persisting, or Perseverance;</hi>
(for so the <hi>Greek</hi> word signifies here,
which our Translation renders <hi>Patience.
Vid. Luke</hi> VIII. 15.) <hi>That after ye have
done the Will of God, ye might receive
the Promise. For yet a little while,
and he that shall come will come, and
will not tarry. Now the just shall live
by Faith. But if any man draw back,
my soul shall have no pleasure in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:60354:128"/>The Examples of <hi>Faith,</hi> which St.
<hi>Paul</hi> enumerates and proposes in the
following words, <hi>Chap.</hi> XI. plainly
shew, that the <hi>Faith</hi> whereby those
Believers of old pleased God, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a steadfast relyance on the
Goodness and Faithfulness of God, for
those good things, which either the
light of Nature, or particular Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
had given them grounds to hope
for. Of what avail this <hi>Faith</hi> was
with God, we may see, <hi>v. 4. By Faith</hi>
Abel <hi>offered unto God a more excellent
Sacrifice than</hi> Cain; <hi>by which he obtained
witness that he was Righteous.</hi> V. 5.
<hi>By Faith</hi> Enoch <hi>was translated, that he
should not see Death: For before his
translation he had this Testimony, that
be pleased God.</hi> V. 7. Noah, <hi>being
warned of God of things not seen as yet;</hi>
being wary, <hi>by Faith prepared an Ark,
to the saving of his House; By the which
be condemned the World, and became
Heir of the Righteousness which is by
Faith.</hi> And what it was that God so
graciously accepted and rewarded, we
are told, <hi>v. 11. Through Faith also</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah
<hi>her self received strength to conceive
seed, and was delivered of a Child; when
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:60354:129"/>
she was past age.</hi> How she came to
obtain this Grace from God, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
tells us; <hi>Because she judged him
Faithful who had promised.</hi> Those
therefore who pleased God, and were
accepted by him before the Coming
of <hi>Christ,</hi> did it only by believing the
Promises, and relying on the Goodness
of God, as far as he had revealed it to
them. For the Apostle, in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
words, tells us, <hi>v. 13. These all died
in Faith, not having received</hi> (the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of) <hi>the Promises; but
having seen them afar off: And were
perswaded of them, and embraced them.</hi>
This was all that was required of them;
to be perswaded of, and embrace the
Promises which they had. They could
be <hi>perswaded of</hi> no more than was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to them; <hi>Embrace</hi> no more than
was revealed; according to the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
they had received, and the Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations
they were under. And if the
Faith of things <hi>seen afar off;</hi> If their
trusting in God for the Promises he
then gave them; If a belief of the
<hi>Messiah</hi> to come; were sufficient to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
those who lived in the Ages before
<hi>Christ,</hi> Acceptable to God, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:60354:129"/>
before him; I desire those who
tell us, that God will not, (nay, some
go so far as to say) cannot accept any
who do not believe every Article of
their particular Creeds and Systems;
to consider, why God, out of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Mercy, cannot as well Justifie
Man now for believing <hi>Iesus of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth</hi>
to be the promised <hi>Messiah,</hi> the
King and Deliverer; as those hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
who believed only that God
would, according to his Promise, in
due time send the <hi>Messiah,</hi> to be a King
and Deliverer.</p>
            <p>There is another Difficulty often to
be met with, which seems to have
something of more weight in it: And
that is, that though the <hi>Faith</hi> of those
before <hi>Christ;</hi> (believing that God would
send the <hi>Messiah,</hi> to be a Prince, and a
Saviour to his People, as he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised;)
And the <hi>Faith</hi> of those since
his time, (believing <hi>Iesus</hi> to be that
<hi>Messiah,</hi> promised and sent by God)
shall be accounted to them for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
Yet what shall become of all
the rest of Mankind; who having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard of the Promise or News of
a Saviour, not a word of a <hi>Messiah</hi> to
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:60354:130"/>
be sent, or that was come, have had
no thought or belief concerning him?</p>
            <p>To this I Answer; That God will
require of every man, <hi>According to
what a man hath, and not according to
what he hath not.</hi> He will not expect
the Improvement of Ten Talents, where
he gave but One; Nor require any one
should believe a Promise, of which he
has never heard. The Apostle's Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning,
<hi>Rom.</hi> X. 14. is very just: <hi>How
shall they believe in him, of whom they
have not heard?</hi> But though there be
many, who being strangers to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
of <hi>Israel,</hi> were also stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to the Oracles of God committed
to that People; Many, to whom the
Promise of the <hi>Messiah</hi> never came, and
so were never in a capacity to believe
or reject that Revelation; Yet God had,
by the Light of Reason, revealed to all
Mankind, who would make use of that
Light, that he was Good and Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
The same spark of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Knowledge in Man, which
making him a Man, shewed him the
Law he was under as a Man; Shewed
him also the way of Attoning the
merciful, kind, compassionate Author
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:60354:130"/>
and Father of him and his Being, when
he had transgressed that Law. He that
made use of this Candle of the Lord,
so far as to find what was his Duty;
could not miss to find also the way to
Reconciliation and Forgiveness, when
he had failed of his Duty: Though if
he used not his Reason this way; If he
put out, or neglected this Light; he
might, perhaps, see neither.</p>
            <p>The Law is the eternal, immutable
Standard of Right. And a part of that
Law is, that a man should forgive, not
only his Children, but his Enemies; upon
their Repentance, asking Pardon, and
Amendment. And therefore he could
not doubt that the Author of this Law,
and God of Patience and Consolation,
who is rich in Mercy, would forgive
his frail Off-spring; if they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
their Faults, disapproved the
Iniquity of their Transgressions, beg'd
his Pardon, and resolved in earnest for
the future to conform their Actions to
this Rule, which they owned to be
Just and Right. This way of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,
this hope of Attonement, the
Light of Nature revealed to them.
And the Revelation of the Gospel ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:60354:131"/>
said nothing to the contrary,
leaves them to stand and fall to their
own Father and Master, whose Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Mercy is over all his Works.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I know some are forward to urge
that place of the</hi> Acts, Chap. <hi>IV. as
contrary to this. The words,</hi> v. 10.
&amp; 12. <hi>stand thus:</hi> Be it known unto
you all, and to all the People of <hi>Israel,</hi>
that by the Name of Iesus Christ of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth,</hi>
whom ye crucified, whom God
raised from the dead, even by him doth
this man, [i. e. <hi>The lame man restored
by</hi> Peter] stand here before you whole.
This is the stone which is set at nought
by you builders, which is become the
head of the Corner. Neither is there
Salvation in any other: For there is
none other name under Heaven given
among men, in which we must be saved.
<hi>Which, in short, is; that</hi> Iesus <hi>is the
only true</hi> Messiah; <hi>Neither is there any
other Person but he given to be a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
between God and Man, in whose
Name we may ask and hope for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will here possibly be asked, <hi>Quor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum
perditio hoec?</hi> What need was there
Of a Saviour? What Advantage have
we by <hi>Iesus Christ?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:60354:131"/>It is enough to justifie the fitness of
any thing to be done, by resolving it
into the <hi>Wisdom of God,</hi> who has done
it; Whereof our narrow Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and short Views may utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacitate
us to judge. We know lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of this visible, and nothing at all
of the state of that Intellectual World;
wherein are infinite numbers and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Spirits out of the reach of our
ken or guess; And therefore know not
what Transactions there were between
God and our Saviour, in reference to
his Kingdom. We know not what need
there was to set up a Head and a Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
in opposition to <hi>The Prince of this
World, the Prince of the Power of the
Air,</hi> &amp;c. Whereof there are more than
obscure intimations in Scripture. And
we shall take too much upon us, if we
shall call God's Wisdom or Providence
to Account, and pertly condemn for
needless, all that that our weak, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
biaffed <hi>Vnderstandings,</hi> cannot
Account for.</p>
            <p>Though this general Answer be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
enough to the forementioned De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and such as a Rational Man, or
fair searcher after Truth, will acquiesce
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:60354:132"/>
in; Yet in this particular case, the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Goodness of God has shewn
it self so visibly to common Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
that it hath furnished us abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
wherewithal to satisfie the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and Inquisitive; who will not take
a Blessing, unless they be instructed
what need they had of it, and why
it was bestowed upon them. The great
and many Advantages we receive by
the coming of <hi>Iesus</hi> the <hi>Messiah,</hi> will
shew that it was not without need, that
he was sent into the World.</p>
            <p>The Evidence of our Saviour's <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
from Heaven is so great, in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Miracles he did before all
sorts of People; (which the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
and Wisdom has so ordered,
that they never were, nor could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
by any of the Enemies and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers
of Christianity,) that what he
delivered cannot but be received as the
Oracles of God, and unquestionable
Verity.</p>
            <p>Though the Works of Nature, in
every part of them, sufficiently Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
a Deity; Yet the World made
so little use of their Reason, that they
saw him not; Where even by the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:60354:132"/>
impressions of himself he was easie to
be found. Sense and Lust blinded their
minds in some; And a careless Inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
in others; And fearful Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
in most (who either believed
there were, or could not but suspect
there might be, Superiour unknown
Beings) gave them up into the hands
of their Priests, to fill their Heads with
false Notions of the Deity, and their
Worship with foolish Rites, as they
pleased: And what Dread or Craft
once began, Devotion soon made Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,
and Religion immutable. In this
state of Darkness and Ignorance of the
true God, Vice and Superstition held
the World. Nor could any help be
had or hoped for from <hi>Reason;</hi> which
could not be heard, and was judged to
have nothing to do in the case: The
Priests every where, to secure their
Empire, having excluded <hi>Reason</hi> from
having any thing to do in Religion.
And in the croud of wrong Notions,
and invented Rites, the World had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
lost the sight of the One only
True God. The Rational and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
part of Mankind, 'tis true, when
they sought after him, found the One,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:60354:133"/>
Supream, Invisible God: But if they
acknowledged and worshipped him, it
was only in their own minds. They
kept this Truth locked up in their
own breast as a Secret, nor ever durst
venture it amongst the People; much
less amongst the Priests, those wary
Guardians of their own Creeds and
Profitable Inventions. Hence we see
that <hi>Reason,</hi> speaking never so clearly
to the Wise and Vertuous, had never
Authority enough to prevail on the
Multitude; and to perswade the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Men, that there was but One
God, that alone was to be owned and
worshipped. The Belief and Worship
of One God, was the National Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of the <hi>Israelites</hi> alone: And if
we will consider it, it was introduced
and supported amongst that People by
<hi>Revelation.</hi> They were in <hi>Goshen,</hi> and
had Light; whilst the rest of the World
were in almost <hi>Egyptian</hi> Darkness, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
God in the World.</hi> There was no
part of Mankind, who had quicker
Parts, or improved them more; that
had a greater light of Reason, or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
it farther in all sorts of Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
than the <hi>Athenians:</hi> And yet
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:60354:133"/>
we find but one <hi>Socrates</hi> amongst them,
that opposed and laughed at their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytheism,
and wrong Opinions of the
Deity; And we see how they rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him for it. Whatsoever <hi>Plato,</hi> and
the soberest of the Philosophers thought
of the Nature and Being of the One
God, they were fain, in their outward
Professions and Worship, to go with
the Herd, and keep to the Religion
established by Law; Which what it
was, and how it had disposed the mind
of these knowing, and quick-sighted
<hi>Grecians,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Acts</hi> XVII.
22-29. <hi>Ye men of Athens,</hi> says he, <hi>I
perceive that in all things ye are too
superstitious. For as I passed by, and
beheld your Devotions, I found an Altar
with this Inscription, TO THE VN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KNOWN
GOD. Whom therefore ye
ignorantly worship, him declare I unto
you. God that made the World, and all
things therein, seeing that he is Lord of
Heaven and Earth, dwelleth not in
Temples made with hands: Neither is
worshipped with mens hands, as though
he needed nay thing, seeing he giveth
unto all life, and breath, and all things;
And hath made of one Blood all the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:60354:134"/>
Nations of Men, for to dwell on the face
of the Earth; And hath determined
the times before appointed, and the
bounds of their Habitations; That they
should seek the Lord, if haply they might
feel him out, and find him, though he
be not far from every one of us.</hi> Here
he tells the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that they, and
the rest of the World (given up to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition)
whatever Light there was
in the Works of Creation and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
to lead them to the True God,
yet they few of them found him. He
was every where near them; yet they
were but like People groping and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for something in the dark, and did
not see him with a full clear day-light;
<hi>But thought the Godhead like to Gold,
and Silver, and Stone, graven by Art
and man's device.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this state of Darkness and Error,
in reference to the <hi>True God,</hi> our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
found the World. But the clear
Revelation he brought with him, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipated
this Darkness; made <hi>the One In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
True God</hi> known to the World:
And that with such Evidence and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nergy,
that <hi>Polytheism</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi>
hath no where been able to withstand
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:60354:134"/>
it. But where ever the Preaching of
the Truth he delivered, and the Light
of the Gospel hath come, those Mists
have been dispelled. And in effect we
see that since our Saviour's time, the
<hi>Belief of One God</hi> has prevailed and
spread it self over the face of the Earth.
For even to the Light that the <hi>Messiah</hi>
brought into the World with him, we
must ascribe the owning, and Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of <hi>One God,</hi> which the <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
Religion had derived and borrowed
from it. So that in this sense it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
and manifestly true of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
what St. <hi>Iohn</hi> says of him;
I <hi>Iohn</hi> III. 8. <hi>For this purpose the Son of
God was manifested, that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the works of the Devil.</hi> This
Light the World needed, and this Light
it received from him: That there is
but <hi>One God,</hi> and he <hi>Eternal; Invisible;</hi>
Not like to any visible Objects, nor to
be represented by them.</p>
            <p>If it be asked, whether the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> by <hi>Moses,</hi> did
not teach this, and why that was not
enough? The Answer is obvious; that
however clearly the Knowledge of One
Invisible God, maker of Heaven and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:60354:135"/>
Earth, was revealed to them; Yet that
Revelation was shut up in a little cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the World; amongst a People
by that very Law, which they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with it, excluded from a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
and Communication with the
rest of mankind. The Gentile World
in our Saviour's time, and several Ages
before, could have no Attestation of
the Miracles, on which the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
built their Faith, but from the <hi>Iews</hi>
themselves; A People not known to
the greatest part of mankind; Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and thought vilely of by those
Nations that did know them; And
therefore very unfit and unable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate
the Doctrine of <hi>One God</hi> in the
World, and diffuse it through the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Earth, by the strength and
force of that Ancient Revelation, upon
which they had received it. But our
Saviour, when he came, threw down
this Wall of Partition; And did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
his Miracles or Message to the
Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> or the Worshippers at
<hi>Ierusalem.</hi> But he himself preached
at <hi>Samaria,</hi> and did miracles in the
Borders of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sydon,</hi> and before
multitudes of People gathered from
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:60354:135"/>
all Quarters. And after his Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
sent his Apostles amongst the
Nations, accompanied with Miracles;
which were done in all Parts so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
and before so many Witnesses
of all sorts, in broad day-light, that,
as I have often observed, the Enemies
of Christianity have never dared to
deny them; No, not <hi>Iulian</hi> himself:
Who neither wanted Skill nor Power to
enquire into the Truth; Nor would
have failed to have proclaimed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
it, if he could have detected any
falshood in the History of the Gospel;
or found the least ground to question
the Matter of Fact published of Christ,
and his Apostles. The Number and
Evidence of the Miracles done by our
Saviour and his Followers, by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and force of Truth, bore down this
mighty and accomplished Emperour,
and all his Parts, in his own Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
He durst not deny so plain Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Fact; Which being granted, the
truth of our Saviour's Doctrine and
Mission unavoidably follows; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
whatsoever Artful Suggestions
his Wit could invent, or Malice should
offer, to the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:60354:136"/>2. Next to the Knowledge of one
God; Maker of all things; A clear
<hi>knowledge of their Duty</hi> was wanting to
Mankind. This part of Knowledge,
though cultivated with some care, by
some of the Heathen Philosophers;
Yet got little footing among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
All Men indeed, under pain of
displeasing the Gods, were to frequent
the Temples: Every one went to their
Sacrifices and Services: But the Priests
made it not their business to teach
them <hi>Virtue.</hi> If they were diligent in
their Observations and Ceremonies;
Punctual in their Feasts and Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and the tricks of Religion; The
holy Tribe assured them, the Gods
were pleased; and they looked no
farther. Few went to the Schools of
the Philosophers, to be instructed in
their Duties; And to know what was
Good and Evil in their Actions. The
Priests sold the better Pennyworths,
and therefore had all the Customs. Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
and Processions were much
easier than a clean Conscience, and a
steady course of Virtue; And an expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory
Sacrifice, that attoned for the
want of it, was much more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:60354:136"/>
than a strict and holy Life. No
wonder then, that Religion was every
where distinguished from, and preferred
to <hi>Virtue;</hi> And that it was dangerous
Heresy and Prophaneness to think the
contrary. So much <hi>Virtue</hi> as was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to hold Societies together;
and to contribute to the quiet of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments;
The Civil Laws of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths
taught, and forced upon
Men that lived under Magistrates. But
these Laws, being for the most part
made by such who had no other aims
but their own Power, reached no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than those things, that would serve
to tie Men together in subjection; Or
at most, were directly to conduce to
the Prosperity and Temporal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of any People. But <hi>Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
in its full extent, was no where,
that I know, taken care of by the
force of Natural Reason. It should
seem by the little that has hitherto been
done in it; That 'tis too hard a thing
for unassisted Reason, to establish Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
in all its parts upon its true foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations;
with a clear and convincing
light. And 'tis at least a surer and
shorter way, to the Apprehensions of
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:60354:137"/>
the vulgar, and mass of Mankind;
That one manifestly sent from God,
and coming with visible Authority from
him, should as a King and Law-maker tell
them their Duties; and require their
Obedience; Than leave it to the long,
and sometimes intricate deductions of
Reason, to be made out to them: Which
the greatest part of Mankind have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
leisure to weigh; nor, for want
of Education and Use, skill to judge
of. We see how unsuccessful in this,
the attempts of Philosophers were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Saviour's time. How short
their several Systems came of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of a true and compleat <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
is very visible. And if, since that,
the Christian Philosophers have much
outdone them; yet we may observe,
that the first knowledge of the truths
they have added, are owing to Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation:
Though as soon as they are
heard and considered, they are found
to be agreeable to Reason; and such as
can by no means be contradicted. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one may observe a great many
truths which he receives at first from
others, and readily assents to, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
to reason; which he would have
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:60354:137"/>
found it hard, and perhaps beyond his
strength to have discovered himself.
Native and Original truth, is not so
easily wrought out of the Mine, as we
who have it delivered, ready dug and
fashon'd into our hands, are apt to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.
And how often at Fifty or Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
years old are thinking Men told,
what they wonder how they could miss
thinking of? Which yet their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations
did not, and possibly never
would have helped them to. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
shews that the knowledge of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
by meer natural light, (how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
soever it be to it) makes but
a flow progress, and little advance in
the World. And the reason of it is not
hard to be found; in Men's Necessities,
Passions, Vices, and mistaken Interests,
which turn their thoughts another way.
And the designing Leaders, as well as
following Herd, find it not to their
purpose to imploy much of their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations
this way. Or whatever else
was the cause, 'tis plain in fact; Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
reason unassisted, failed Men in
its great and proper business of <hi>Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
It never from unquestionable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
by clear deductions, made out
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:60354:138"/>
an entire Body of the <hi>Law of Nature.</hi>
And he that shall collect all the Moral
Rules of the Philosophers, and compare
them with those contained in the New
Testament, will find them to come
short of the <hi>Morality</hi> delivered by our
Saviour, and taught by his Apostles;
A College made up for the most part
of ignorant, but inspired Fishermen.</p>
            <p>Though yet, if any one should
think, that out of the sayings of the
Wise Heathens, before our Saviour's
time, there might be a Collection
made of all those Rules of <hi>Morality,</hi>
which are to be found in the Christian
Religion; Yet this would not at all
hinder, but that the World neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
stood as much in need of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
and the <hi>Morality</hi> delivered by him.
Let it be granted (though not true) that
all the <hi>Moral Precepts</hi> of the Gospel were
known by some Body or other, amongst
Mankind, before. But where or how, or
of what use, is not considered. Suppose
they may be picked up here and there;
Some from <hi>Solon</hi> and <hi>Bias</hi> in <hi>Greece;</hi>
Others from <hi>Tully</hi> in <hi>Italy:</hi> And to
compleat the Work, let <hi>Confutius,</hi> as far
as <hi>China,</hi> be consulted; And <hi>Anacarsis</hi>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:60354:138"/>
the <hi>Scythian</hi> contribute his share. What
will all this do, to give the World a
<hi>compleat morality;</hi> That may be to
Mankind, the unquestionable Rule of
Life and Manners? I will not here urge
the impossibility of collecting from
men, so far distant from one another,
in time, and place, and languages. I
will suppose there was a <hi>Stobeus</hi> in
those times, who had gathered the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
sayings,</hi> from all the Sages of the
World. What would this amount to,
towards being a steady Rule; A certain
transcript of a Law that we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?
Did the saying of <hi>Aristippus,</hi> or
<hi>Confutius,</hi> give it an Authority? Was
<hi>Zeno</hi> a Lawgiver to Mankind? If not,
what he or any other Philosopher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
was but a saying of his. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
might hearken to it, or reject it,
as they pleased; Or as it suited their
interest, passions, principles or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.
They were under no Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
The Opinion of this or that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher,
was of no Authority. And
if it were, you must take all he said
under the same Character. All his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
must go for Law, certain and
true; Or none of them. And then, If
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:60354:139"/>
you will take any of the Moral sayings
of <hi>Epicurus</hi> (many whereof <hi>Seneca</hi>
quotes, with esteem and approbation)
for Precepts of the <hi>Law of Nature;</hi>
You must take all the rest of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
for such too; Or else his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
ceases: And so no more is to be
received from him, or any of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of old, for parts of the <hi>Law of
Nature,</hi> as carrying with it an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be obeyed, but what they prove
to be so. But such a Body of <hi>Ethicks,</hi>
proved to be the Law of Nature, from
principles of Reason, and reaching all
the Duties of Life; I think no body
will say the World had before our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
time. 'Tis not enough, that
there were up and down scattered say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of wise Men, conformable to right
Reason. The Law of Nature, was the
Law of Convenience too: And 'tis no
wonder, that those Men of Parts, and
studious of Virtue; (Who had occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to think on any particular part of
it,) should by meditation light on the
right, even from the observable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
and beauty of it; Without
making out its obligation from the true
Principles of the Law of Nature, and
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:60354:139"/>
foundations of <hi>Morality.</hi> But these
incoherent apohtegms of Philosophers,
and wise Men; however excellent in
themselves, and well intended by
them; could never make a Morality,
whereof the World could be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
And with certainty depend on.
Whatsoever should thus be universally
useful, as a standard to which Men
should conform their Manners, must
have its Authority either from Reason
or Revelation. 'Tis not every Writer
of Morals, or Compiler of it from
others, that can thereby be erected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Law-giver to Mankind; and a
dictator of Rules, which are therefore
valid, because they are to be found
in his Books; under the Authority of
this or that Philosopher. He that any
one will pretend to set up in this kind,
and have his Rules pass for authentique
directions; must shew, that either he
builds his Doctrine upon Principles of
Reason, self-evident in themselves; or
that he deduces all the parts of it from
thence, by clear and evident demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration:
Or must shew his Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from Heaven; That he comes with
Authority from God, to deliver his
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:60354:140"/>
Will and Commands to the World. In
the former way, no body that I know be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Saviour's time, ever did; or
went about to give us a <hi>Morality.</hi> 'Tis
true there is a <hi>Law of Nature.</hi> But
who is there that ever did, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to give it us all entire, as a Law;
No more, nor no less, than what was
contained in, and had the obligation
of that Law? Who, ever made out
all the parts of it; Put them together;
And shewed the World their obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
Where was there any such Code,
that Mankind might have recourse to,
as their unerring Rule, before our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
time? If there was not, 'tis
plain, there was need of one to give
us such a <hi>Morality;</hi> Such a Law, which
might be the sure guide of those who
had a desire to go right; And if they
had a mind, need not mistake their
Duty; But might be certain when
they had performed, when failed in it.
Such a <hi>Law of Morality,</hi> Jesus Christ
hath given us in the New Testament;
But by the later of these ways, by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.
We have from him a full and
sufficient Rule for our direction; And
conformable to that of Reason. But
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:60354:140"/>
the truth and obligation of its Precepts;
hath its force, and is put past doubt
to us, by the evidence of his Mission.
He was sent by God: His Miracles
shew it; And the Authority of God
in his Precepts cannot be questioned.
Here <hi>Morality</hi> has a sure Standard, that
Revelation vouches, and Reason can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
gainsay, nor question; but both
together witness to come from God the
great Law-maker. And such an one
as this out of the New Testament, I
think the World never had, nor can
any one say is any where else to be
found. Let me ask any one, who is
forward to think that the Doctrine of
<hi>Morality</hi> was full and clear in the World,
at our Saviour's Birth; Whether would
he have directed <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi>
(both Men of Parts and Virtue, the one
whereof believed, and the other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believed
a future Being) to be satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Rules and Obligations of all
the parts of their Duties; If they
should have asked him where they
might find the Law, they were to live
by, and by which they should be charged
or acquitted, as guilty or innocent?
If to the sayings of the Wise, and
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:60354:141"/>
the Declarations of Philosophers; He
sends them into a wild Wood of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
to an endless maze; from which
they should never get out: If to the
Religions of the World, yet worse:
And if to their own Reason, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
them to that which had some light
and certainty; but yet had hitherto
failed all Mankind in a perfect Rule;
And we see, resolved not the doubts
that had risen amongst the Studious and
Thinking Philosophers; Nor had yet
been able to convince the Civilized parts
of the World, that they had not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
nor could without a Crime,
take away the Lives of their Children,
by Exposing them.</p>
            <p>If any one shall think to excuse hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, by laying blame on
Men's <hi>negligence,</hi> that they did not
carry Morality to an higher pitch;
and make it out entire in every part,
with that clearness of demonstration
which some think it capable of; He
helps not the matter. Be the cause
what it will, our Saviour found Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
under a Corruption of Manners
and Principles, which Ages after Ages
had prevailed, and must be confessed
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:60354:141"/>
was not in a way or tendency to be
mended. The Rules of Morality were
in different Countries and Sects, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.
And natural Reason no where
had, nor was like to Cure the Defects
and Errors in them. Those just mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of Right and Wrong, which
necessity had any where introduced,
the Civil Laws prescribed, or Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
recommended; Stood not on their
true Foundations. They were looked
on as bonds of Society, and Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
of common Life, and laudable
Practises. But where was it that their
Obligation was throughly known and
allowed, and they received as Precepts
of a Law; Of the highest Law, the
Law of Nature? That could not be,
without a clear knowledge and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of the Law-maker, and the
great Rewards and Punishments, for
those that would or would not obey
him. But the Religion of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
as was before observed; little
concerned it self in their Morals. The
Priests that delivered the Oracles of
Heaven, and pretended to speak from
the Gods; Spoke little of Virtue and
a good Life. And on the other side,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:60354:142"/>
the Philosophers who spoke from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
made not much mention of the
Deity in their <hi>Ethicks.</hi> They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
on Reason and her Oracles;
which contain nothing but Truth.
But yet some parts of that Truth lye
too deep for our Natural Powers easily
to reach, and make plain and visible to
mankind, without some Light from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
to direct them. When Truths
are once known to us, though by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
we are apt to be favourable to
our own Parts; And ascribe to our own
Understandings the Discovery of what,
in truth, we borrowed from others;
Or, at least, finding we can prove what
at first we learnt from others, we are
forward to conclude it an obvious
Truth, which, if we had sought, we
could not have missed. Nothing seems
hard to our Understandings, that is
once known; And because what we see
we see with our own Eyes, we are apt
to over-look or forget the help we had
from others, who first shewed and poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it out to us, as if we were not at
all beholden to them for that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
Which Being of Truths we now
are satisfied of, we conclude our own
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:60354:142"/>
Faculties would have lead us into with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any assistance; And that we know
them, as they did, by the strength
and perspicuity of our own minds,
only they had the luck to be before us.
Thus the whole stock of Human Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is claimed by every one, as his
private Possession, as soon as he (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting
by others Discoveries) has got it
into his own mind; And so it is: But
not properly by his own single Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
nor of his own Acquisition. He
studies, 'tis true, and takes pains to
make a progress in what others have
delivered; But their pains were of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sort, who first brought those Truths
to light, which he afterwards derives
from them. He that Travels the Roads
now, applauds his own strength and
legs, that have carried him so far in
such a scantling of time; And ascribes
all to his own Vigor, little consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how much he ows to their pains,
who cleared the Woods, drained the
Bogs, built the Bridges, and made the
Ways passable; without which he might
have toiled much with little progress.
A great many things we have been
bred up in the belief of from our Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:60354:143"/>
(and are Notions grown Familiar,
and as it were Natural to us, under the
Gospel,) we take for unquestionable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
Truths, and easily demonstrable;
without considering how long we might
have been in doubt or ignorance of
them, had Revelation been silent. And
many are beholden to Revelation, who
do not acknowlede it. 'Tis no dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
to Revelation, that Reason gives
its Suffrage too to the Truths Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
has discovered. But 'tis our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
to think, that because Reason con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
them to us, we had the first cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
knowledge of them from thence,
and in that clear Evidence we now pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
them. The contrary is manifest,
in the <hi>defective Morality of the Gentils</hi>
before our Saviour's time; and the want
of Reformation in the Principles and
Measures of it, as well as Practice.
Philosophy seemed to have spent its
strength, and done its utmost; Or if it
should have gone farther, as we see it
did not, and from undenyable Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
given us <hi>Ethicks</hi> in a Science like
Mathematicks in every part demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strable,
this yet would not have been
so effectual to man in this imperfect
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:60354:143"/>
state, nor proper for the Cure. The
bulk of mankind have not leisure nor
capacity for Demonstration; nor can
carry a train of Proofs; which in that
way they must always depend upon
for Conviction, and cannot be required
to assent till they see the Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Wherever they stick, the Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
are always put upon Proof, and
must clear the Doubt by a Thread of
coherent deductions from the first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
how long, or how intricate so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
that be. And you may as soon
hope to have all the Day-Labourers
and Tradesmen, the Spinsters and Dairy
Maids perfect Mathematicians, as to
have them perfect in <hi>Ethicks</hi> this way.
Hearing plain Commands, is the sure
and only course to bring them to Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and Practice. The greatest part
cannot know, and therefore they must
believe. And I ask, whether one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from Heaven in the Power of God,
in full and clear Evidence and Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of Miracles, giving plain and
direct Rules of <hi>Morality</hi> and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
be not likelier to enlighten the
bulk of Mankind, and set them right
in their Duties, and bring them to do
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:60354:144"/>
them, than by Reasoning with them from
general Notions and Principles of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Reason? And were all the Duties
of Humane Life clearly demonstrated;
yet I conclude, when well considered,
that Method of teaching men their
Duties, would be thought proper only
for a few, who had much Leisure, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
Understandings, and were used
to abstract Reasonings. But the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the People were best still
to be left to the Precepts and Principles
of the Gospel. The healing of the
Sick, the restoring sight to the Blind
by a word, the raising, and being raised
from the Dead, are matters of Fact,
which they can without difficulty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive;
And that he who does such
things, must do them by the assistance
of a Divine Power. These things lye
level to the ordinariest Apprehension;
He that can distinguish between sick
and well, Lame and sound, dead and
alive, is capable of this Doctrine. To
one who is once perswaded that Jesus
Christ was sent by God to be a King,
and a Saviour of those who do believe
in him; All his Commands become
Principles: There needs no other Proof
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:60354:144"/>
for the truth of what he says, but that
he said it. And then there needs no
more but to read the inspired Books,
to be instructed: All the Duties of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
lye there clear, and plain, and
easy to be understood. And here I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,
whether this be not the surest,
the safest, and most effectual way of
teaching: Especially if we add this
farther consideration; That as it suits
the lowest Capacities of Reasonable
Creatures, so it reaches and satisfies,
Nay, enlightens the highest. And the
most elevated Understandings cannot
but submit to the Authority of this
Doctrine as Divine; Which coming
from the mouths of a company of il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate
men, hath not only the atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of Miracles, but reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it; Since they delivered no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
but such, as though Reason of
it self had not clearly made out, Yet
it could not but assent to when thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered;
And think itself indebted for
the Discovery. The Credit and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
our Saviour and his Apostles
had over the minds of Men, by the
Miracles they did; Tempted them not
to mix (as we find in that of all the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:60354:145"/>
Sects of Philosophers, and other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions)
any Conceits; any wrong
Rules; any thing tending to their own
by-interest, or that of a Party; in their
Morality. No tang of prepossession or
phansy; No footsteps of Pride or Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
Ostentation or Ambition, appears
to have a hand in it. It is all pure, all
sincere; Nothing too much, nothing
wanting: But such a compleat Rule of
Life, as the wisest Men must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
tends entirely to the good of
Mankind: And that all would be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
if all would practise it.</p>
            <p>3. The outward forms of <hi>Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the Deity,</hi> wanted a Reformation.
Stately Buildings, costly Ornaments,
peculiar and uncouth Habits, And a
numerous huddle of pompous, phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical,
cumbersome Ceremonies, every
where attended Divine Worship. This,
as it had the peculiar Name, so it was
thought the principal part, if not the
whole of Religion. Nor could this
possibly be amended whilst the Jewish
Ritual stood; And there was so much
of it mixed with the Worship of the
True God. To this also our Saviour,
with the knowledge of the infinite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:60354:145"/>
supream Spirit, brought a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy;
in a plain, spiritual, and suitable
Worship. <hi>Iesus</hi> says to the Woman of
<hi>Samaria, The hour cometh, when ye shall
neither in this Mountain, nor yet at</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
<hi>worship the Father. But the
True Worshippers, shall worship the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
both in Spirit and in Truth; For
the Father seeketh such to worship.</hi> To
be Worshipped in Spirit and in Truth;
With application of Mind and sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Heart, was what God henceforth
only required. Magnificent Temples,
and confinement to certain Places, were
now no longer necessary for his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
Which by a Pure Heart might be
performed any where. The splendor
and distinction of Habits, and pomp of
Ceremonies, and all outside Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
might now be spared. God
who was a Spirit, and made known to
be so, required none of those; but the
Spirit only: And that in publick As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
(where some Actions must lie
open to the view of the World) All
that could appear and be seen, should
be done decently, and in order, and to
Edification. Decency, Order, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification,
were to regulate all their
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:60354:146"/>
publick Acts of Worship; And beyond
what these required, the outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
(which was of little value in
the Eyes of God) was not to go. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
shut out indecency and confusions
out of their Assemblies, they need not
be solicitous about useless Ceremonies.
Praises and Prayer, humbly offered up
to the Deity, was the Worship he now
demanded; And in these every one was
to look after his own Heart, And know
that it was that alone which God had
regard to, and accepted.</p>
            <p>4. Another great advantage received
by our Saviour, is the great incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he brought to a virtuous and pious
Life: Great enough to surmount the
difficulties and obstacles that lie in the
way to it; And reward the pains and
hardships of those, who stuck firm to
their Duties, and suffered for the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of a good Conscience. The
Portion of the Righteous has been in
all Ages taken notice of, to be pretty
scanty in this World. Virtue and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
do not often accompany one
another; And therefore Virtue seldom
had many Followers. And 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
She prevailed not much in a State,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:60354:146"/>
where the Inconveniencies that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
her were visible, and at hand; And
the Rewards doubtful, and at a distance.
Mankind, who are and must be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to pursue their Happiness; Nay,
cannot be hindred; Could not but
think themselves excused from a strict
observation of Rules, which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
so little to consist with their chief
End, Happiness; Whilst they kept
them from the enjoyments of this Life;
And they had little evidence and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of another. 'Tis true, they might
have argued the other way, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded;
That, Because the Good were
most of them ill treated here. There
was another place where they should
meet with better usage: But 'tis plain,
they did not. Their thoughts of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Life were at best obscure: And
their expectations uncertain. Of <hi>Manes,</hi>
and Ghosts, and the shades of departed
Men, There was some talk; But little
certain, and less minded. They had
the Names of <hi>Styx</hi> and <hi>Acheron;</hi> Of
Elisian fields, and seats of the Blessed:
But they had them generally from their
Poets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mixed with their Fables. And so
they looked more like the Inventions of
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:60354:147"/>
Wit and Ornaments of Poetry, than
the serious perswasions of the grave and
the sober. They came to them bund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
up amongst their tales; And for
tales they took them. And that which
rendred them more suspected, and less
useful to virtue, was, that the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
seldom set on their Rules on
Men's Minds and Practises, by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of another Life. The chief
of their Arguments were from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of Virtue: And the highest
they generally went, was the exalting
of humane Nature. Whose Perfection
lay in virtue. And if the Priest at any
time talked of the Ghosts below, and
a Life after this, it was only to keep
Men to their Superstitious and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Rites; Whereby the use of this
Doctrine was lost to the credulous Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude;
And its belief to the quicker
sighted, who suspected it presently of
Priest-craft. Before our Saviour's time,
the Doctrine of a future State, though
it were not wholly hid, yet it was not
clearly known in the World. 'Twas
an imperfect view of Reason; Or, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the decay'd remains of an ancient
Tradition; which rather seemed to float
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:60354:147"/>
on Mens Phansies, than sink deep into
their Hearts. It was something, they
knew not what, between being and not
being. Something in Man they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
might scape the Grave: But a
a perfect compleat Life of an Eternal
duration, after this; was what entred
little into their thoughts, and less into
their perswasions. And they were so
far from being clear herein, that we
see no Nation of the World publickly
professed it, and built upon it: No Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
taught it: And 'twas no where
made an Article of Faith, and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Religion till Jesus Christ came;
Of whom it is truly said, that he at
his appearing <hi>brought light and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
to light.</hi> And that not only in
the clear Revelation of it; And in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
shewn of Men raised from the
Dead; But he has given us an unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable
assurance and pledge of it, in
his own Resurrection and Ascention in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Heaven. How hath this one truth
changed the Nature of things in the
World? And given the advantage to
Piety over all that could tempt or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Men from it. The Philosophers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
shewed the beauty of Virtue:
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:60354:148"/>
They set her off so as drew Mens Eyes
and approbation to her: But leaving
her unendowed, very few were willing
to espouse her. The generality could
not refuse her their esteem and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation;
But still turned their Backs
on her and forsook her, as a match not
for their turn. But now there being
put into the Scales, on her side, <hi>An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
and immortal weight of Glory;</hi>
Interest is come about to her; And
Virtue now is visibly the most enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
purchase, and by much the best
bergain. That she is the perfection and
excellency of our Nature; That she is
her self a Reward, and will recommend
our Names to future Ages, is not all
that can now be said for her. 'Tis not
strange that the learned Heathens satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
not many with such airy commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.
It has another relish and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy,
to perswade Men that if they
live well here, they shall be happy here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
Open their Eyes upon the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
unspeakable joys of another Life;
And their Hearts will find something solid
and powerful to move them. The
view of Heaven and Hell, will cast a
slight upon the short pleasures and
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:60354:148"/>
pains of this present state; and give
attractions and encouragements to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
which reason, and interest, and
the Care of our selves, cannot but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
and prefer. Upon this foundation,
and upon this only, Morality stands
firm, and may defy all competition.
This makes it more than a name; A
substantial Good, worth all our aims
and endeavours; And thus the Gospel
of Jesus Christ has delivered it to us.</p>
            <p>5. To these I must add one advantage
more we have by Jesus Christ, and that
is the promise of assistance. If we do
what we can, he will give us his Spirit
to help us to do what, and how we
should. 'Twill be idle for us, who know
not how our own Spirits move and act
us, to ask in what manner the Spirit
of God shall work upon us. The Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
that accompanies that Spirit,
knows better than we how we are made,
and how to work upon us. If a wise Man
knows how to prevail on his Child,
to bring him to what he desires; Can
we suspect, that the Spirit and Wisdom
of God should fail in it; though we
perceive or comprehend not the ways
of his Operation? Christ has promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:60354:149"/>
it, who is faithful and just; And
we cannot doubt of the Performance.
'Tis not requisite on this occasion, for
the inhancing of this benefit, to enlarge
on the frailty of our Minds, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our Constitutions; How liable
to mistakes, how apt to go astray, and
how easily to be turned out of the paths
of Virtue. If any one needs go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
himself, and the testimony of his
own Conscience in this point; If he
feels not his own errors and passions
always tempting, and often prevailing,
against the strict Rules of his Duty;
He need but look abroad into any Age
of the World to be convinced. To a
Man under the difficulties of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
beset with Temptations, and hedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in with prevailing Custom; 'tis no
small encouragement to set himself
seriously on the courses of Virtue, and
practise of true Religion, That he is
from a sure hand, and an almighty arm,
promised assistance to support and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
him through.</p>
            <p>There remains yet something to be
said to those who will be ready to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
If the belief of Jesus of <hi>Nazareth</hi>
to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> together with those
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:60354:149"/>
concomitant Articles of his Resurrection,
Rule, and coming again to Judge the
World, be all the Faith required as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to Justification, to what purpose
were the Epistles written; I say, if the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of those many Doctrines contained in
them, be not also necessary to Salvation?
And if what is there delivered, a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
may believe or disbelieve, and yet
nevertheless be a Member of Christ's
Church, and one of the Faithful?</p>
            <p>To this I Answer, That the Epistles
were written upon several occasions: And
he that will read them as he ought, must
observe what 'tis in them is principally
aimed at; find what is the Argument in
hand, and how managed; if he will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
them right, and profit by them.
The observing of this will best help us
to the true meaning and mind of the
Writer: For that is the Truth which is
to be received and believed; And not
scattered Sentences in Scripture-Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
accommodated to our Notions
and Prejudices. We must look into the
drift of the Discourse, observe the cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and connexion of the Parts, and
see how it is consistent with it self, and
other parts of Scripture; if we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:60354:150"/>
it right. We must not cull out,
as best suits our System, here and there
a Period or a Verse; as if they were all
distinct and independent Aphorisms;
and make these the Fundamental Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the Christian Faith, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to Salvation, unless God has made
them so. There be many Truths in
the Bible, which a good Christian may
be wholly ignorant of, and so not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
which, perhaps, some lay great
stress on, and call Fundamental Articles,
because they are the distinguishing
Points of their Communion. The Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
most of them, carry on a Thread
of Argument, which in the stile they
are writ, cannot every where be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
without great Attention. And
to consider the Texts, as they stand and
bear a part in that, is to view them in
their due light, and the way to get the
true sense of them. They were writ to
those who were in the Faith, and true
Christians already: And so could not
be designed to teach them the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Articles and Points necessary to
Salvation. The Epistle to the <hi>Romans</hi>
was writ to all <hi>that were at</hi> Rome <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
of God, called to be Saints, whose
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:60354:150"/>
Faith was spoken of through the World,</hi>
Chap. 1. 7, 8. To whom St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s first
Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> was, he shews,
<hi>Chap</hi> I. 2. 4. <hi>&amp;c. Vnto the Church of God
which is at</hi> Corinth, <hi>to them that are san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
in Christ Iesus, called to be Saints;
with all them that in every place call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Name of Iesus Christ our Lord,
both theirs and ours. I thank my God
always on your behalf, for the grace of
God which is given you by Iesus Christ;
That in every thing ye are enriched by
him in all utterance, and in all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
Even as the Testimony of Christ
was confirmed in you. So that ye come
behind in no gift; waiting for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> And so
likewise the second was, <hi>To the Church
of God at</hi> Corinth, <hi>with all the Saints
in</hi> Achaia, <hi>Chap.</hi> I. 1. His next is to the
<hi>Churches of</hi> Galatia. That to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi>
was, <hi>To the Saints</hi> that were <hi>at</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus,
<hi>and to the faithful in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</hi>
So likewise, <hi>To the Saints and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Brethren in Christ at</hi> Colosse, <hi>who
had Faith in Christ Iesus, and love to
the Saints. To the Church of the</hi> Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonians.
<hi>To Timothy</hi> his <hi>Son in the
Faith. To Titus</hi> his <hi>own Son after the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:60354:151"/>
common Faith. To</hi> Philemon <hi>his dearly
beloved, and fellow-labourer.</hi> And the
Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> calls those he
writes to, <hi>Holy Brethren, partakers of
the Heavenly Calling, Chap.</hi> III. 1. From
whence it is evident, that all those whom
St. <hi>Paul</hi> writ to, were <hi>Brethren, Saints,
Faithful</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> and so <hi>Christians</hi>
already; And therefore wanted not the
Fundamental Articles of the Christian
Religion; without a belief of which
they could not be saved: Nor can it
be supposed, that the sending of such
Fundamentals was the reason of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle's
Writing to any of them. To
such also St. <hi>Peter</hi> writes, as is plain
from the first Chapter of each of his
Epistles. Nor is it hard to observe the
like in St. <hi>Iames</hi> and St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Epistles.
And St. <hi>Iude</hi> directs his thus: <hi>To them
that are sanctified by God the Father,
and preserved in Iesus Christ, and called.</hi>
The Epistles therefore being all written
to those who were already Believers
and Christians, the occasion and end of
writing them, could not be to Instruct
them in that which was necessary to
make them Christians. This 'tis plain
they knew and believed already; or
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:60354:151"/>
else they could not have been Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
and Believers. And they were writ
upon Particular Occasions; and without
those Occasions had not been writ; and
so cannot be thought necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:
Though they resolving doubts,
and reforming mistakes, are of great
Advantage to our Knowledge and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.
I do not deny, but the great
Doctrines of the Christian Faith are
dropt here and there, and scattered up
and down in most of them. But 'tis
not in the Epistles we are to learn what
are the Fundamental Articles of Faith,
where they are promiscuously, and
without distinction mixed with other
Truths in Discourses that were (though
for Edification indeed, yet) only oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casional.
We shall find and discern those
great and necessary Points best in the
Preaching of our Saviour and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
to those who were yet strangers,
and ignorant of the Faith, to bring
them in, and convert them to it. And
what that was, we have seen already
out of the History of the Evangelists,
and the <hi>Acts;</hi> where they are plainly
laid down, so that no body can mistake
them. The Epistles to particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:60354:152"/>
besides the main Argument of each
of them, (which was some present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
of that particular Church to
which they severally were address'd) do
in many places explan the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
of the Christian Religion; and that
wisely; by proper Accommodations to
the Apprehensions of those they were
writ to, the better to make them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibe
the Christian Doctrine, and the
more easily to comprehend the Method,
Reasons, and Grounds of the great work
of Salvation. Thus we see in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
to the <hi>Romans,</hi> Adoption (a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
well known amongst those of
<hi>Rome</hi>) is much made use of, to explain
to them the Grace and Favour of God,
in giving them Eternal Life; to help
them to conceive how they became the
Children of God, and to assure them
of a share in the Kingdom of Heaven,
as Heirs to an Inheritance. Whereas
the setting out, and confirming the
Christian Faith to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> in the
Epistle to them, is by Allusions and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
from the Ceremonies, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
and Oeconomy of the Jews, and
Reference to the Records of the Old
Testament. And as for the General
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:60354:152"/>
Epistles, they, we may see, regard the
state, and exigencies, and some peculia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
of those times. These Holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
inspired from above, writ nothing
but Truth; and in most places very
weighty Truths to us now; for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding,
clearing, and confirming of
the Christian Doctrine, and establishing
those in it who had embraced it. But
yet every Sentence of theirs must not
be taken up, and looked on as a Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Article necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
without an explicit belief whereof,
no body could be a Member of Christ's
Church here, nor be admitted into his
Eternal Kingdom hereafter. If all, or
most of the Truths declared in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles,
were to be received and believed
as Fundamental Articles, what then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
of those Christians who were fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
asleep? (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> witnesses in his
First to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> many were)
before these things in the Epistles were
revealed to them? Most of the Epistles
not being written till above Twenty
Years after our Saviour's Ascension, and
some after Thirty.</p>
            <p>But farther, therefore, to those who
will be ready to say, May those Truths
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:60354:153"/>
delivered in the Epistles, which are not
contained in the Preaching of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
and his Apostles, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by this Account not necessary to
Salvation, be believed, or disbelieved
without any danger? May a Christian
safely question or doubt of them?</p>
            <p>To this I Answer, That the Law of
Faith, being a Covenant of Free Grace,
God alone can appoint what shall be
necessarily believed by every one whom
he will Justifie. What is the Faith which
he will accept and account for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
depends wholly on his good
Pleasure. For 'tis of Grace, and not of
Right, that this Faith is accepted. And
therefore he alone can set the Measures
of it: And what he has so appointed
and declared, is alone necessary. No
body can add to these Fundamental Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Faith; nor make any other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
but what God himself hath
made and declared to be so. And what
these are, which God requires of those
who will enter into, and receive the
Benefits of the New Covenant, has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
been shewn. An explicit belief
of these, is absolutely required of all
those to whom the Gospel of Jesus
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:60354:153"/>
Christ is preached, and Salvation
through his Name proposed.</p>
            <p>The other parts of Divine Revelation
are Objects of Faith, and are so to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
They are Truths whereof none
that is once known to be such, may or
ought to be disbelieved. For to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
any Proposition to be of Divine
Revelation and Authority, and yet to
deny or disbelieve it, is to offend against
this Fundamental Article and Ground
of Faith, that God is true. But yet a
great many of the Truths revealed in
the Gospel, every one does, and must
confess, a man may be ignorant of; nay,
disbelieve, without danger to his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
As is evident in those, who allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Authority, differ in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
and meaning o several Texts
of Scripture, not thought Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal:
In all which 'tis plain the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
Parties, on one side or tother,
are ignorant of, nay, disbelieve the
Truths delivered in Holy Writ; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Contrarieties and Contradictions
can be contained in the same words,
and Divine Revelation can mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to it self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:60354:154"/>Though all divine Revelation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
the obedience of Faith; yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
truth of inspired Scriptures is not
one of those, that by the Law of Faith
is required to be explicitly believed to
Justification. What those are, we have
seen by what our Saviour and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
proposed to, and required in those
whom they Converted to the Faith.
Those are fundamentals; which 'tis not
enough not to disbelieve: Every one is
required actually to assent to them. But
any other Proposition contained in the
Scripture, which God has not thus
made a necessary part of the Law of
Faith, (without an actual assent to which
he will not allow any one to be a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver)
a Man may be ignorant of, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hazarding his Salvation by a defect
in his Faith. He believes all that God
has made necessary for him to believe,
and assent to: And as for the rest of
Divine Truths, there is nothing more
required of him, but that he receive
all the parts of Divine Revelation, with
a docility and disposition prepared to
imbrace, and assent to all Truths com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from God; And submit his mind
to whatsoever shall appear to him to
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:60354:154"/>
bear that Character. Where he, upon
fair endeavours, understands it not;
How can he avoid being ignorant? And
where he cannot put several Texts, and
make them consist together; What Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy?
He must either interpret one by
the other, or suspend his Opinion. He
that thinks that more is, or can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
of poor frail Man in matters of
Faith, will do well to consider what
absurdities he will run into. God out of
the infiniteness of his Mercy, has dealt
with Man as a compassionate and tender
Father. He gave him Reason, and with
it a Law: That could not be otherwise
than what Reason should dictate; Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we should think, that a reasonable
Creature, should have an unreasonable
Law. But considering the frailty of
Man, apt to run into corruption and
misery, he promised a Deliverer, whom
in his good time he sent; And then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to all Mankind, that whoever
would believe him to be the Saviour
promised, and take him now raised
from the dead, and constituted the Lord
and Judge of all Men, to be their
King and Ruler, should be saved. This
is a plain intelligible Proposition; And
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:60354:155"/>
And the all-merciful God seems herein
to have consulted the poor of this
World, and the bulk of Mankind. These
are Articles that the labouring and illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
Man may comprehend. This is
a Religion suited to vulgar Capacities;
And the state of Mankind in this World,
destined to labour and travel. The
Writers and Wranglers in Religion fill
it with niceties, and dress it up with
notions; which they make necessary
and fundamental parts of it; As if
there were no way into the Church,
but through the Academy or Lyceum.
The bulk of Mankind have not leisure
for Learning and Logick, and superfine
distinctions of the Schools. Where the
hand is used to the Plough, and the
Spade, the head is seldom elevated to
sublime Notions, or exercised in myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
reasonings. 'Tis well if Men of
that rank (to say nothing of the other
Sex) can comprehend plain propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and a short reasoning about things
familiar to their Minds, and nearly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
to their daily experience. Go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
this, and you amaze the greatest
part of Mankind: And may as well
talk <hi>Arabick</hi> to a poor day Labourer, as
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:60354:155"/>
the Notions and Language that the
Books and Disputes of Religion are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with; and as soon you will be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
The Dissenting Congregations
are supposed by their Teachers to be
more accurately instructed in matters
of Faith, and better to understand the
Christian Religion, than the vulgar Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists,
who are charged with great
ignorance; How truly I will not here
determine. But I ask them to tell me
seriously, whether half their People
have leisure to study? Nay, Whether
one in ten of those who come to their
Meetings in the Country, if they had
time to study them, do or can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
the Controversies at this time so
warmly managed amongst them, about
Justification, the subject of this present
Treatise. I have talked with some of
their Teachers, who confess themselves
not to understand the difference in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
between them. And yet the points
they stand on, are reckoned of so great
weight, so material, so fundamental in
Religion, that they divide Communion
and separate upon them. Had God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
that none but the Learned
Scribe, the disputer or wise of this World,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:60354:156"/>
should be Christians, or be Saved, thus Religion
should have been prepared for them; filled with
speculations and niceties, obscure terms, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract
notions. But Men of that expectation, Men
furnished with such acquisitions, the Apostle tells
us, I <hi>Cor.</hi> I. are rather shut out from the simplicity
of the Gospel; to make way for those poor, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
illiterate, Who heard and believed promises
of a Deliverer; and believed Jesus to be him;
Who could conceive a Man dead and made alive
again, and believe that he should at the end of the
World, come again, and pass Sentence on all Men,
according to their deeds. That the poor had the
Gospel Preached to them; Christ makes a mark as
well as business of his Mission. <hi>Mat.</hi> XI. 5. And
if the poor had the Gospel Preached to them, it
was, without doubt, such a Gospel, as the poor could
understand, plain and intelligible: And so it was,
as we have seen, in the Preachings of Christ and
his Apostles.</p>
