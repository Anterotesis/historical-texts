            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is a booke to inſtruct young heires to keepe out of books and bonds, which oftentimes are the maine cauſe of their ouerthrow, and brings that long ſuſpected blow vpon their ſhoulders, which if it chance to light heere, they may cleerely diſcouer the Keepers large conſcience, and be throwly inſtructed to ſhunne their extortion. My ſecond reaſon is an Apologie, to ſhield mee from thoſe wounding tongues, that may perhaps taxe me for wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſo harſhly againſt <hi>Citizens, Prodigals, Sarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants</hi> and other <hi>Officers,</hi> to ſuch I anſwer, let the gall'd iade winch till he breake his heeles againſt my buckler, which thus I aduance.

Neither ſeeme I to carpe at the bounty or large expence of young Gentle-men, whoſe meanes and birth are correſpondent. No, no, I rather encourage and commend their worths, for of ſuch there are too few, and for their ſakes onely, I haue diſcouered what trappes and ſnares are daily ſet by careleſſe Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrifts, to winde them into the like ruine they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues are in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They haue ſtrange deuices, and a certain kinde of longing to caſt their eſtates in a conſumption,

by which their perſons may lie languiſhing vnder that infectious diſeaſe, wherewith they themſelues are poyſoned, by the incurable plague of pouerty. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Sargeants,</hi> I hope there are none ſo ſhallow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, to thinke my pen ſo full of vineger, to write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their meere profeſsion, which in a well-gouern'd State is ſo neceſſary. I rather wiſh they were as free from abuſing their place and office, as I am from diſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it, and then a ſhorter chapter would ſerue to diſcouer their ſiniſter deuices &amp; treacherous dealings, which I haue obſerued ſo carefully, that if any of the fraternity of the Mace-mongers chance to fall ſicke at the conceit, let them but diligently view it ouer, and they ſhall finde as comfortable cordials to refreſh the heart, as I did from that colde cawdle when they firſt arreſted me, which I willingly beſtow vpon them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall. But me thinkes I heare ſome curious Criticke murmure before he hath read ouer halfe the preamble, becauſe I entitle it a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> and begin it ſo ſingly with my ſelfe: to ſuch I anſwer my vnwilling experience and not reports of that they ſhall read here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, emboldened mee to write the truth, that I haue tried, which may beget beleefe in thoſe that read, if not, I wiſh it may be their good fortunes to goe the voyage, and let them confute me if they can.

A building cannot be raiſed without a ground-worke, or a tree will ſeeme naked without branches, and a man wanting limbs to ſupport him, is but a decrepit bodie,

Being thus drencht in a boundleſſe ſea of melancholly, for the ſpace of a fortnight or three weekes together, Ireſolued to walke into the yard, to ſee if I could eſpie any of my friends that were in the Maſter-ſide, purpoſing to ſpend the day away in diſcourſe, but I walkt there an houre or more, and ſaw none but ſuch as were as melancholly as my ſelfe, ſo I determined to walke vp againe, but by chance I turned my head aſide, and ſaw the cellar doore ſtanding open, gaping to ſwallow any priſoner that drew neere, ſo hoping to finde ſome of mine olde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance there, I ſtept downe, and being no ſooner deſcended, but I beheld a company of Gentlemen, all priſoners, ſitting at a ſquare table, making themſelues exceeding merry with the muſike the cans made, being as brimfull of beere, at mine heart was of melancholly, or theirs of mirth, ſome hauing the pipes neuer out of their mouthes, who puft more ſmoake out of their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, then euer came out of Cole-harbar chimneyes, or any brew-houſe in <hi>Saint Katherines:</hi> ſome againe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging as merrily, as if they had been as free as the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

Why, ſaid he, it is an excellent purge for the head, true, ſayd I, but it is a vilde purge for the purſe, and that for mine owne part, I had rather haue a peece of

               <p>Alas, alas, this is but to grinde the blunt apperite of my commodity taker into a ſharper edge, and make them more greedy of their owne ruines, imitating the cunning and deceit of pretty, but petulant and cloſe Curtezans, that are nice when a ſicke-brain'd yoong Gallant importunes them vpon any kindneſſe, onely to make him more fierce vpon his owne confuſion,

holding him off, like a Fencer, at diſtance a moueth or two, becauſe he ſhall come vp the roundlier to her pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: but to the matter.</p>
               <p>But ſome or one of my young Gallants that neuer giues ouer plodding with himſelfe how hee might get into the bookes of ſome <hi>Gold-ſmith, Habberdaſher, Silk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Woollen</hi> or <hi>Linnen-draper,</hi> hath ſome Broker or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comming earely in a morning and certifies him, that if it pleaſed him, he ſhould haue a commodity that lay ready to bee carried away, if hee would enter into bond for it, nominating the ſame man that gaue him the former repulſe.

and the <hi>Woolfe</hi> (that came as Legate from the <hi>Tyger</hi>) go together, and finde my Citizen buſie in his ſhop, not taking any notice of their comming, but (as to other paſſingers) at firſt askes them what they lack, and what they would buy, but boldly they come into the ſhoppe and after acquaintance taken, the Broaker vnfoldes the matter, and the occaſion of their comming to him, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him that he came with a friend of his about a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, and if hee were a friend, as hee alwaies tooke him to bee, as to condeſcend to the Gentle mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and let him haue an hundred pound: for (ſaith he) I know his friends are of faire poſſeſſions, he is his fathers eldeſt ſon, beſides on my conſcience he would not trouble you at this preſent, if he were not to marry with a rich widdow, whom he may loſe for want of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth, and then no doubt when the match is made vp, but he will haue an honeſt care to pay in your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with a million of thankes for your kindneſſe. Now all the while the Broaker is pleading, mine <hi>Innocent</hi> doth ſecond him, and will rather then goe without his trinkets, binde whatſoeuer the Broaker ſaith with halfe a ſcore oathes.</p>
               <p>The Citizen begin to hearken after this, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts to my greene goſling, that he would be glad to do any man a pleaſure, but that he hath had ſo many loſſes alreadie, and that he would bee willing to let him haue an hundred pounds worth of commodities, if ſo be he thought it would redound to his good, and that hee might bee ſure at the ſixe moneths end to haue his money paid in, the young Gallant proteſts, the Broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker warrants it, and at laſt, though very loah, the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen condeſcends, but how, thus, that if hee could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure as good a man as himſelfe to be bound with him, he ſhould haue what ware he could deſire, for, ſaith he, mans life is fraile and brittle, and you may die a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night or a weeke hence, for ought that I know, nay, to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2156:16"/>
morrow, or ſoone at night, and then where is nine hundred pound, therefore, good Sir, looke out ſome of your moſt eſpeciall and indeered friends, and get one of them to be bound with you, and you ſhall haue the wares at a quarter of an houres warning. The tide now is turn'd, and <hi>Signior Unthrift</hi> put to his <hi>non-plus,</hi> and at laſt fals to intreat Maſter <hi>Broaker</hi> to bee the man, who for two or three daies together, will by no meanes or perſwaſions bee won to enter into bond with him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept hee muſt ſhare halfe. Is not this extreame and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt incredible villany? and moſt vnconſcionable dealings, thus to ſnare in the Gentry of the land, and ruine his fortunes but newly in the ſpring, knowing that he will rather let him haue three quarters of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity</hi> then goe without it, becauſe, as many others do, hee would goe gallant, haue money in his purſe, and keepe company with ſatten and veluet out-ſides.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe the commodities are deliuered, after they haue both ſealed the bonds (you muſt ſuppoſe the Heire alwaies to bee the principall) how muſt theſe <hi>Hobby horſes, Reames of browne paper, Iewes-trumps</hi> and <hi>Bables, Babies</hi> and <hi>Rattles</hi> be ſolde, the Gentle-man is aſhamed to proffer them to ſale himſelfe, no, he truſts the other that ſhares halfe with him, to put them off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who muſt be hired to ſell them, and perhaps when they are all ſolde out right, will haue to his owne ſhare three quarters of them, are not theſe dealings worthy of the the ſharpeſt rodde <hi>Iuſtice</hi> euer did holde in her righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hands, they are and haue beene ſoundly laſht, and ſeuerely puniſht, by that moſt noble, graue, wiſe and prouident Stateſ-man, the Right Honourable the <hi>Lord high Chancellor of England,</hi> yet for all this there will ſuch falſe play be acted, though the Sword of Iuſtice continually were hanging ouer their heads: but I will returne to our former ſubiect, let vs now ſuppoſe my young Gallant reuelling in a Tauerne or Ordinary:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2156:16"/>
you may bee ſure the Broaker is triumphing, that hee pluckt the feathers of this young gull, and meanes ere long to leaue him as bare of meanes as he is of braines. Now my vſurious Citizen dreames of nothing but his day, which he hopes my nouice will breake, which is no ſooner expired, but inſtantly, by ſome ſtratagem or other, gets him within the liberty, then inuites him to ſupper (by giuing him faire words) either to his owne or ſome of his neighbours houſes, and when they haue almoſt made an end, inſteed of a meſſe of fruit, or a peece of <hi>Banbury</hi> cheeſe to cloſe vp their ſtomackes, a Brace (or more) of Sargeants are not farre from his ſhoulder, and except he preſently pay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he muſt preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to priſon. Are theſe worthy the names of Citizens? no, no, ſuch may be Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> but neuer of <hi>Heauenly Ieruſalem.</hi> At this period I began to ſpeake to him, ſaying: Sir, I proteſt you haue reuealed a ſtrange and monſtrous abuſe to the Gentry of this land, if I did not take you to bee (what I thinke you are) an honeſt man, I ſhould ſtand in a great doubt, whether your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe did taſte of truth or no: but good Sir proceede. Sir, as I hope for ſaluation, ſayd he, (an oath not for a Chriſtian to dally with) I relate no vntruth, but what is as nigh a kin to truth as I am to miſery, for what I haue ſpoken, I finde by mine owne wofull experience to be true, and what hath beene practiſed on my ſelfe by theſe City-Cormorants, theſe trickes haue beene put on me, and for which I haue ſuffered a long impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet they will haue no compaſſion on mee, but rather ſee mee ſtarue then releeue mee, and either haue my carkaſſe or their coyne, yet their conſciences know, what I had from them was nothing but rotten, baſe &amp; moth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>eaten commodities, an hundred pounds worth, of which (according to their rate) I neuer made fifty of, yet they ſticke not to demand an hundred of me, beſide the intereſt and all their charges.</p>

                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:2156:17"/>Againe, marke the policy they haue to keep a poore priſoner in fetters of aduerſity: if they ſuppoſe the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner goeth about to ſue out an <hi>Audita querela,</hi> foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they either put their debt ouer to ſome <hi>Alderman,</hi> or elſe agree with ſome Officer in the Exchequer, and ſo put their debt ouer to the king, faining they owe him ſo much money, knowing that the <hi>Cauncery</hi> wil not, or cannot allow any thing, in ſuch a caſe as this, to proceed againſt his Maieſty. This is a ſpeeding tricke, and ſuch a one I am now trounc't with, and many beſides my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>I haue read when Iewes haue bought a red hair'd boy, at firſt they will cloath him in ſilkes and taffaties, rauiſh him with all delights that can bee thought on, neuer haue muſique from his eares or banquets from his taſte, and thus vſe him vntill ſuch time they know he is plump, fat and fit for their purpoſe; but when the poore Chriſtian leaſt thinkes of his imminent ruine, he is taken by a brace of ſlaues, and tied vp by the heels, ſo by degrees beaten to death with cudgels, hauing <hi>Mummie</hi> made of his braines: Such as theſe are vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable Citizens, that at firſt will cloath our young Prodigals in ſilkes and veluets, golde and ſiluer lace, inuite him home to dinner, vſe him very courteouſly, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his bonds are due, &amp; that he leſt dreams of his misfortunes, a couple or two of Sargeants are ſet vpon him, and hurry him to the Compter, where perhaps he ſhall lie two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> three, foure or fiue yeere, nay a dozen or twenty yeeres together before hee can get himſelfe releaſed, or if hee chance to preuaile ſo much with his creditors, as to enfranchize him, it muſt be vpon ſome vnreaſonable, vnconſcionable condition, as to giue him fiue hundred pound for an hundred at the death of his father. <hi>Vulcan</hi> fell from Heauen into the Ile of <hi>Lemnos,</hi> and by that fall loſt the vſe of one of his feete, let all ſuch vnconſcionable Citizens take heede they fall

not from the earth to Hell, and loſe their ſoules.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Boares that plow vp whole acres, nay whole fields of Gentlemens lands with their ſnoutes, theſe are ſwine that eate vp whole Orchards, and theſe are they whoſe fiery conſciences drinke vp whole fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pooles at a drought; their vſurious dealings make ſo many <hi>Cornutos</hi> in the City as there are, for when young Gentlemen haue beene beggered by their extortion they haue no other meanes then to fall in with their wiues and ſeek to them for ſupply: It is this that makes <hi>Newmarket</hi> heath, and <hi>Royſton-dounes</hi> about Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſ time ſo full of high-way men that poore Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie people cannot paſſe quietly to their Cottages, but ſome Gentleman will borrow all the mony they haue (only indeed they will make them take their bonds) this makes Tiburne and Wapping haue ſo many han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers-on, and this is the cauſe ſo many ſuch Citizens ſonnes are plagued after their fathers deaths as their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers when they were liuing haue plagued others, for moſt commonly ſome knaue or deboſht fellow lurch the fooles their ſons as cunningly after their fathers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe as they did others only to make their ſonnes Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who at laſt may as miſerably die in the Hole for want of ſuſtenance as ſome of his fathers debtors haue done before him.</p>
               <p>Vpon this I began to interrupt him ſaying, ſir in this ſhort time that I haue beene here I haue ſeen ſome Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors bring their Debtors both meat, drinke, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny when they haue beene ſicke, and ill at eaſe.</p>
               <p>Tis true ſir ſaid he, I acknowledge it, but did you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heare that when a Lion hath got a pretty bleating lambe or kid in his pawes hee will play and tumble vp and downe with them a little while, but you muſt not thinke it is for any loue hee beares them, but onely to chafe their blood and make them eate more ſweete, and tender: Such are theſe kinde of vnkinde Citizens
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2156:18"/>
that when they haue got young Gentlemen into priſon will (if the ſumme be any thing weighty) relieue him with meate, drinke, and mony, (if they ſee him begin to droope) but do you thinke this is in loue to him? no, if you doe you wander a thouſand leagues from a true conſtruction, hee doth it to keepe him aliue that hee may haue his mony if any meanes ſhould fall to him, and that the world may take notice of his charitie, alas, alas this is but a fained holineſſe, which is a double in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity: This kindneſſe is but like <hi>Alchimy,</hi> or <hi>Saint Martins rings</hi> that are faire to the eye, and haue a rich outſide, but if a man ſhould breake them a ſunder, and looke into them, they are nothing but braſſe, and copper. The Apples of <hi>Gomorrha</hi> haue glorious rinds but infectious cores.</p>
               <p>It is an extreame miſery for a Priſoner to be indeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a rich man, or a very poore man; for the firſt (moſt commonly) will haue all or none, for if his debtour chance to die, the loſſe he may well ſpare, but if it is his fortune to liue, and pay him it addes to his eſtate, the other (that is) the poore man will haue no pitty becauſe it may be the debt is all he is worth.</p>
               <p>Thus doe many Gentlemen periſh vnder the hands of cruell Creditours, nay a father that hath brought vp his childe with care and paine, griefe and heart break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and thinkes to leaue him ſuch faire poſſeſſions af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his deceaſe, that he may liue in his Countrey like a Gentleman (as his aunceſtors haue done before him) either in his life time doth ſee his ſonne lie rotting in priſon, or is not able to ſhew his face out of his fathers gates, or after his deceaſe, his brothers, ſiſters, friends and kinsfolkes ſee his lands extended on, his woods felled downe before his face, thoſe legacies and porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he ſhould pay to his brothers and ſiſters, paide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to ſatisfie his debts (being baſe commodities) and ſo beggers a whole worſhipfull Family, who before that

his acquaintance a feather, the Peacocke lent him one of his plumes brauely ſhining with variety of cullors, the Parrot lent him one of his greene fethers, the gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finch one of his yellow, ſo that as ſoone as he was dreſt and had preſented himſelfe before the Royall and princely Bird, and diſmiſt, he flew vp and downe the woods ſo proudly that euery inferiour Bird) as the Titmouſe, the Hedgſparrow, and Wren) began to adore him: At laſt theſe birds that he had been ſo much beholding to, came to challenge their fethers of him, and (though very loath) he was conſtrained to render them back againe, that when he was bare and naked he lookt ten times worſe then thoſe poore birds that late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did admire him. Such Popiniayes are theſe that bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of euery Citizen to make them ſhew glorious in the worlds eye, but when the Goldſmiths, Marchants, Silkemen, and Haberdaſhers come to claime their own and get it, they will ſeeme ten times more foule then lately they did faire and glorious. Theſe are the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall cauſes that many fathers diſinherit their right Meires (and put in their ſecond ſonnes) who at laſt are forced to marry ſome whore for want of meanes, or flie into the <hi>Lowcontries</hi> and for halfe a crowne a weeke ſerue in ſome Garriſon towne, for if they are caught (being by their meanes runne into debt) they will be clapt into priſon, and there lie and rot, where in proceſſe of time (when theſe cheating Gallants grow old and their trickes faile) may lie themſelues and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a priſon, and end their daies in the Hole, in pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, famine, and extreame wretchedneſſe. Thus haue I deſcribed to you the nature of the ſecond arme that continually runnes to the maine Ocean the Compter, now will I haſt to the third which is</p>

               <p>IN heauen there are many times ingendred Meteors, Exhalations, and fiery Comets: In many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries there are many Monſters, as in <hi>Ruſſia</hi> rugged beares, in <hi>Germany</hi> tusked-Boares, in <hi>Clenoma</hi> taile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong Lyons, in <hi>Ireland</hi> cruell blood-ſucking backbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſixfooted Creepers: but the moſt rauening and cruell Monſters in our Land are the ſhoulder clapping purſebiting mace-bearers. A neceſſarie euill and plagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorein the body of an infected City, and a diſeaſe that the moſt of the Gentry is ſicke of. For as in the moſt medicinable phiſicke there is moſt infectious poyſon (which elſe would not bee forcible or haue any ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue) ſo in the moſt peacefull, and populous Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth there muſt be ſuch neceſſarie inſtruments or elſe it would not long continue: theſe are they that ſtrike with the axe of Law and luſtice deeper cuts then they haue authority for, ſo that ſometimes they murther a whole family at a blow, and haue no more mercy when they ſtrike then a Spaniſh-army when they are vpon the execution or ſlaughter of their enemy. Yet thus much I will ſay for them when a Gentlemans fortunes begin to be ſicke and craſie, moſt commonly they will apply him with caudles and cordials which only haue
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2156:24"/>
but this fault they taſt ſome thing too much of the Mace, a ſpice more familiar in <hi>England</hi> then in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies:</hi> for the moſt baſe ſort of people in the Land are neuer without it in their pockets. But now I thinke on it I will not be inuectiue againſt them becauſe no ſubiect plaies his part to the life ſo well as theſe do, then what kinde of vocation is more neceſſarie in a Commonwealth? I hold them very religious men, for they will continually watch and pray, watch a whole day together to catch young Gentlemen, and after they haue clutcht them pray vpon them: They are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry valiant men for they will ſtrike the braueſt ſpirit that walkes in the ſtreete, I haue known many Knights run away at the ſight of them: they are men of great reſpect and reuerence, for I haue ſeene many Gentlemen giue them the wall, and rather then they will iuſtle with them let them haue the whole ſtreete at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: They are men of good conſciences for they will do nothing without warrant vnleſſe it be now and then for their aduantage: They are very louing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for I haue ſeene them come running to a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and hange about his necke and not leaue him to the death: They are very familiar and as ſociable as any whore, for they will be drunke with any man (ſo it bee not of their owne coſt) And laſtly, very kinde and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable for they will promiſe a young Gentleman more curteſie then a Courtier wil a citizen: Why then ſhould we not thinke well of Sergeants? Sir (ſaid I) I am ſure you ſpeake this Paradox only to make your ſelfe (and mee) merry, for on my conſcience what you now ſpeak is rather in an ironicall kinde of faſhion then ſerious or true, for if you will haue my opinion of them, they are the excrement that proceeds from the body of a Commonwealth, whoſe vilde doings haue beene ſo vnſauorie to mee that (for euer as all the world elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide do) I ſhall hate them worſe then a Butcher doth
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2156:24"/>
Lent, or a Fiſhmonger Chriſtmas or Eaſter weekes, therefore good Sir be not partiall in your proceedings but laſh them at the whipping poſt of Iuſtice and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, while you fetch as much blood from their ribbes as they haue teares from many poore men and womens eyes.</p>
               <p>Faith Sir (ſaid he) indeed to tell you true I am like a kinde mother, that hauing ſeene her child doe ſome wittie vnhappie tricke ſtands in doubt whether ſhee ſhall laugh at him and let him eſcape, or frowne at him and correct him: ſo I hauing ſeene the cleanely and ſmooth practiſes of theſe fellowes know not whether I ſhall ſmile at them, and let them eſcape the ſcourge of my tongue, or grieue at them and correct their enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, but howſoeuer I haue ſo braue and conſtant a Champion on my ſide as Truth I will go on though all the Sergeants belonging both to <hi>Poultry</hi> and <hi>Woodſtreet Compter</hi> were within eareſhot of mee, therefore thus I will charge vpon them with a volley ſhall wound ſome of their conſciences (if it is poſſible for them to haue any.)</p>
               <p>In ancient <hi>Rome</hi> the <hi>Lictores,</hi> or <hi>Sergeants</hi> went alwaies with their ſtaues of Office in their hands, and in ſuch apparell that the whole City knew them, and yet to this day in this forme, and faſhion they continue, or cary about them ſome marke of difference: So in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries they are ſo markeable that they are no ſooner ſeene then knowne: But here in <hi>England</hi> (where they once went in pide coates and white roddes in their hands as a badge of infamie) they will alter their faſhion of habite oftner then a Whore doth her lodge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or a French Count his ſhirts in ſummer-time: <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teus</hi> neuer changed ſhapes oftner then theſe fellowes, for ſometime they will go accoutred like a ſcholler, then like a Merchant, ſometime like a Councellor, then a Butcher, Porter, or Countrie-gentleman with
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2156:25"/>
their bootes and ſpurres as durty as if they had rid fiue hundred mile through the deepeſt ſlowy way that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was trauelled; but this is (moſt commonly) when they go to arreſt ſome Farmer or Yeoman of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try that is either but newly come into his Inne, or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of towne, and a hundred more ſuch ſtratagems haue they in their heads when they are well greaſed in the hand; or when the arreſt is ſomething dangerous. Therfore firſt of all I will relate the manner they often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times arreſt a man to make you a little merry, and then proceed to the manner of their vſage of a man after they haue arreſted him. A <hi>Norwich</hi> man being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly indebted to certaine <hi>Londoners</hi> (who often laide waite to arreſt him) came to the City ſo priuate that they knew not how to come at him, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time they had intelligence where he was; and when (as it was very ſeldome) the Citizens came to parley with him it was out of a window, but he could by no means be drawne nigh their forces for hee was too ſubtile for them, and alwaies left word with the ſeruants in the houſe where he lay, that none ſhould haue acceſſe to him before ſuch time he himſelfe had ſeene them, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they were in ſatten doublets, cloakes faced with taffatie, and ruffes of a Marchants ſett; at laſt his Creditors being incenſed againſt him (caring not what coſt they were at ſo they might Incounter him) came to the Compter in <hi>Woodſtreete</hi> and feed halfe a ſcore Sergeants promiſing them if they could take him they ſhould haue a lacobus a piece beſides, one of theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the buſines, ſtraight forged a deuice which was in this manner, hee was certified that this <hi>Norwich</hi> man had weeekly ſome letters come to him out of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> and that the Porter that brought them had free acceſſe to him, this Sergeant inſtantly prouided a frocke, a red-cappe, a rope about his ſhoulders (which would haue become his necke better) and with letters in his
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2156:25"/>
hand directed to the ſame party, trudges to his lodging being iuſt on that day the Porter was accuſtomed to come to him; knocking at the doore and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his buſines told them that he had letters out of <hi>Norfolke</hi> for ſuch a Gentleman, vpon this he was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected vp ſtaires to the Chamber-doore, who no ſooner knockt but the Gentleman did ſtart vp from his bed to the Chamber-doore peeping before through the key-hole, and ſeeing him to be a Porter let him in, as ſoone as hee was entred hee bidde his worſhippe good morrow, vales his bonnet, and deliuers him a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that ſhould come from a Gentleman of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but as he was opening of it, what doth my Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doe but pulls his mace out of his pocket (the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman not dreaming of ſuch a breakfaſt) and laide on his ſhoulders, and arreſted him, telling him that he was not what he ſeemed to be (a Porter) but what hee was a Sergeant, and that there was no way with him but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to giue ſatisfaction to his Creditors, or to priſon, therefore make your ſelfe ready, and along. So he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how hee was betraide and arreſted went quietly with him to the Compter, and died in execution. As pretty a pranke as this the ſame Sergeant plaide by an other Gentleman that ſtood vpon his guard, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his Creditors with him the day before ſeemed to grow to a compoſition with him vpon the ſealing of certaine bonds, promiſing to releaſe him while a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day, telling him that the next day they would bee with him, and bring a Councellor, and a Scriuener: a Councellor to giue them direction for the managing of the buſines on both ſides, and the Scriuener to make and write what they ſhould determine. The Creditors hauing taken their leaue ſtraight plotted together ouer night how they might arreſt the Gentleman in the morning, and hauing inuented the proiect, forth-with went to the Compter and there did ſee theſe Sergeants
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2156:26"/>
and halfe a dozen more with them to diſpatch this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines: the Sergeants being well oyled in the hand with <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> were as hot vpon the exploite as an <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> on a wench of fiueteene, and did long to put their deuice in practiſe, the Sergeant would needes take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to be the Councellor, and his Yeoman the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uener, who had attired themſelues ſo quaint that they who had neuer ſeene them before would haue ſworne they had beene the ſame they counterfeited, for the Sergeant had a Barriſters gowne on his backe (that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer after could not chooſe but infect the true Owner with knauery) a double ruffe about his necke, and his beard cut as cloſe as a ſtubble field; his Yeoman (that had as villanous a looke as any Scriuener betweene <hi>Charing, croſſe</hi> and <hi>Pauls</hi>) had his inkehorne at his gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, his pen in his care, and his parchment and waxe in his hand, and away they go with a ſcore more of their Comrades, whom they had appointed not to be farre from them but to come and releiue them when they heard a piſtoll diſcharged (which lay in the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans window ready charged to guard himſelfe with) the Citizens led the way, and my Councellor and Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uener trot after vntill they came to the houſe, ſo the folkes ſeeing there was no body but ſuch as had beene there the day before (except a Councellor and a Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uener) conducted them vp into the Gentlemans chamber (where were halfe a dozen of his men about him for feare of the worſt (ſo the Gentleman and the creditors began to lay open the matter to the <hi>Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cellor</hi> who deſired the <hi>Gentleman</hi> to diſmiſſe his ſeruants for halfe an hower, for it was not fit they ſhould heare any of their proceedings; they were ſo then the Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler begins to vtter his opinion, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2156:26"/>
ſtraight ran vp into the chamber with their ſwords drawen, and layd hold on him, telling him their intent and what they were, ſo the poore Gentle-man ſeeing himſelfe thus caught (rather then goe to priſon) payd the debt, ſo ſent the Sargeants and Citizens away.</p>
               <p>Other ſuch dog-trickes as theſe haue they plaid, as vpon a Marchant, that (either vpon pollicy or-pouerty) broke, and hauing made all his goods ready to goe into the Low-Countryes wanted nothing to diſpatch, but to mend three or foure dry-fats, which he ment to put his goods in, and gaue order to his Maide, to prouide two or three Coopers to mend them, but ſhee (being brib'd by his Creditors) betrayd her maſters purpoſe to them, ſo they prouided halfe a dozen Sargeants, to goe like Coopers the next morning, to mend this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants dry-fats, and were let in to diſpatch it, and had direction from the Marchant himſelfe how to finiſh it: but as he was buſie about them, inſteed of hooping the barrels, they hoopt him in their armes, and arreſted him, ſo that before they left him, they made him pay the executions they had to charge him withall, and was glad to giue them a fee beſide, that they ſhould lay no more actions on him.</p>
               <p>An hundred ſuch ſtratagems they haue beene fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in, and came off without dread or danger, but now I haue related to you the manner of their arreſting many men, now will I tell you how they vſe many (or moſt) men they haue arreſted. If they perceiue the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty whom they haue ceas'd on to be a Country-Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, they will be buſie with him to know whether this were the firſt time he was arreſted, if it bee, they haue the better ſubiect to worke on, and know (as they term it) how to milke them the better. Firſt they will carry him to ſome Tauerne (but it ſhall bee nigh one of the Compters) where they will call for pottle after pottle, and ſuch meat as the houſe affords, holding him in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2156:27"/>
while their guts are full, telling him they will do him what pleaſure they can for him, and that they only keepe him there, becauſe they would haue his aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries come to him, and diſpatch him with all expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſwearing to him, that they were ſorry to doe their office vpon him, and that if his creditor had not beene with them, they had rather haue giuen a crowne to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to arreſt him, then take a twenty-ſhilling peece to execute their office. Vpon this, one of them will makes as though hee goes to fetch his <hi>Aduerſary,</hi> when God knowes, he goes vp and downe <hi>Cheap-ſide,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of the City, enquiring among the Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whether ſuch a Gentle-man bee indebted to him or no if he bee, then hee will tell them, if hee will giue him a peece of money hee will vndertake to arreſt him, for he by chance had intelligence where hee ſupt, and when he hath his fees, what will hee doe but goe to the Compter, enter an action, takes his warrant out of the office, and comes to the Tauerne againe, telling him, he hath beene with his Aduerſary, and that hee could not poſſible come to him this three or foure hours yet, and that if he would giue them any money, they would ſtay with him, if not, they muſt haue him to the Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for they had or her buſineſſes to diſpatch, that they might get fiue pound by, if he offer them an Angell or a Marke for two or three houres waiting with them, account it nothing, and ſcorne to ſtay ſo long for ſo ſmall a matter, knowing the poore Gentle man will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther disburſe the value of twenty ſhillings, then goe to priſon, ſtill expecting his Aduerſaries comming, of whoſe approach there is no more hope, then of the Kings: little thinking of the villanie they are practizing againſt him, yet ſtil he expects his Aduerſary, but when it begins to bee late they call for ſomething to ſupper, and according to the lining of the poore mans purſe will ſauce him, if they ſee he hath good ſtore of crowns,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2156:27"/>
they will councell him to goe and lie in their houſe a day or two, telling him it is a thouſand to one whether his Aduerſary will come or no, for though he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed he would not faile, yet hee ſeem'd very vnwilling, beſides (ſay they) if you feare any other actions, wee can keepe you ſo ſafe in our houſe, that none of them ſhall know where to finde you; whereas if you were in priſon, they would all come thundering vpon you, ſo it may be you may be laid vp for two or three winters: Theſe ſpeeches terrifies my poore Gentle man, and ſtill rather then he would goe to priſon, would giue all the money in his purſe, at laſt, hauing diſcharged all the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning at the Tauerne, away he goes with them, and lies in ſome of their houſes a day or two, which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough (for it will coſt him at leaſt twenty ſhillings day and night) and yet the poore man is farther from his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, then when he was firſt arreſted, and when theſe purſe-leeches haue ſuckt him dry, then they bring him to priſon.</p>
               <p>Why Sir (ſaid I) when I was arreſted I neuer ſaw any ſuch abuſes among them, it may be ſo, ſaid he, then they perceiued you had no money, or that you were too wiſe to be cheated, for I haue ſeene diuers Gentle men come into priſon (after they haue laine a fortnight or three weekes at ſome of their houſes, at an exceſſiue rate) without either cloake, ſword or hat which the Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants haue got from them, onely bearing them in hand that they will get them baile.</p>
               <p>Againe, if he be a poore ſimple fellow, as ſome Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing-man, or Countrey Tradeſman, they will carry him to ſome blinde Ale-houſe, and there practize on him, telling him, that if hee goe to priſon, it will coſt him at firſt entrance a marke or fourteene ſhillings, and that he muſt haue irons put on his legs, as ſoone as hee comes in, and put into a place where hee ſhall neither ſee foot or hand, while he hath diſcharged the debt, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2156:28"/>
that he would giue them ſo much money, they ought to haue for arreſting him, and ſomething to drinke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they would if it ſhould bee his fortune to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeak to the Keepers to vſe him kindly. This trick I haue knowen them ſerue a poore Country fellow, and brought him to priſon with neuer a penny in his purſe: once they ſeru'd a friend of mine ſo, but I think I made them render the money backe againe, and be glad they could be rid ſo quietly of him.</p>
               <p>If I ſhould but repeat but halfe their abuſes, I ſhould fill a reame of paper, I haue ſeene them come dragging in a poore man by the heels, that his head hath knockt againſt the ſtones for a quarter of a mile together, and ſo battered and martyred, that a man could ſcarce know whether he were a man or no. Sometimes when they know a man in feare of arreſting, they will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warrant from the Creditor, giue him a caſt of their office, onely to get ſome money out of him, and ſo let him goe againe: ſometime when they are feed to arreſt a man, they will ſend the party word to keepe out of their way, hoping to haue a gratitude from him: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time when they haue arreſted a man (if the creditours be not by) will not ſticke to take a brace or two of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and let him goe, telling his aduerſary the next time he meets him, he cannot ſet eye of him, and whereas a Sargeants fee from the Creditor is no more then one ſhilling for an arreſt, they ſcorne to ſtep from the gate vnder a Crowne, a Noble or an Angell, and whereas there is a ſtatute that none of them ſhall take aboue a groat of him that is arreſted, they will not ſticke to milk him out of all his money, and turne him into priſon without either hat, cloake or ſword,</p>
               <p>They haue other tricks as bad as theſe, as for example, when they haue arreſted any man, either vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or action, &amp; if any Gentleman or Tradſman, or of what faſhion ſo ere he be, by chance do but iuſtle them
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:2156:28"/>
as they are bringing their priſoner to the Compter, for if they call them by their right names, <hi>Varlets,</hi> they (without warrant or any authority from ſome Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our power, as Iuſtice or Conſtable, but by the vertue of their owne office) will carry him to priſon, and either lay my Lord Maiors command on him, or clap ſome heauy action on him, that except he haue good friends or a fat purſe to compound with them, he may lie and rot there for all them. *I know a poore man that did<note place="margin">One <hi>Atkinſon</hi> now dwelling at High gate.</note> but offer to reſcue his friend, was clapt vp by them, and could neuer get free from them while hee was worth a teſter, and if the Iudge, before whom hee was bail'd, had not beene more pitifull then they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable, he had beene in priſon all his life time.</p>
               <p>If any man they arreſt, in his ſtruggling to make an eſcape from them, chance to hit any of them, either on the legs, face or breſt, ſo that they haue no hurt at all, they will gripe, beat and pinch the poore man ſo miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, that hee ſhall not bee able to lift his arme to his head, and then enter an action of battery againſt him, which will more vex and diſturbe him then all the reſt: I my ſelfe haue beene eye-witneſſe of the like, for in the beginning of <hi>August,</hi> 1616. they arreſted a poore <note n="*" place="margin">Iohn Rogers.</note> Seruing-man, who had an action entered againſt him by them, becauſe hee offered to make an eſcape from them, and when he had all his other actions withdrawn he could by no meanes get free from them, they were ſo vnreaſonable in compounding with him, that hee tooke a ſtrong conceit, and the nineteenth of the ſame month ended his life.</p>
               <p>Thus haue I portrayed foorth in my freſheſt cullours the abuſes and wrongs his Maieſties ſubiects daily ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine by theſe Sargeants, for which they can haue little or no remedy, and as well as I could, waded through the third arme that paies tribute to the <hi>Maine Ocean</hi> the <hi>Compter.</hi> Now will I proceede to the fourth and laſt.</p>

Why Sir, ſaid I, I haue often heard it reported, that the Beadles and Watch-men are in fee with the Keepers of both the Compters, and that for euery man they commit they receine a groat, and therefore onely for gaine, will (vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any light or ſlight fault) carry any man that comes in their way to priſon, or if any man fee them, they will
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2156:29"/>
(if he be neuer ſo drunke, vnruly or diſordered) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uay him to his lodging; or otherwiſe, if hee bee vnfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht, conuay him to one of the Compters. And to mine owne knowledge I haue knowne a Beadle committed to the Gatehouſe for committing a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſeruant (who went vpon ſpeciall buſines for the Lord his Maſter) therefore if he had not firſt wronged this Gentleman, and ſecondly the force, and nature of his Office, why ſhould he being an Officer be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for his miſdemeanour? Againe I haue ſeene many men come into priſon (ſince I came hither) that haue been extreamly hackt and maimed with their halberds: which in (my opinion) they cannot anſwer, for though they haue authority to commit, they haue none to kill or wound, therefore in my iudgement theſe abuſes are vnſufferable, and onely are vpholden by their Head the Conſtable.</p>
               <p>Sir (ſaid he) you muſt vnderſtand that a Conſtable is but an Iland brooke that paies but ſmall tribute to the Ocean the Compter, he is but <hi>cauſa accidentalis,</hi> an accidentall cauſe, and by chance fattens the groſſe and vaſt body of it, for after his watch is ſet hee is bound by oath to performe his office both for the diſcharge of his owne conſcience, and the good of his Prince, and Countrey, in which duty euery good ſubiect is bound in duty to aſſiſt him. For a Conſtable is the preſeruer of peace, the attacher of vice, and the Intelligencer of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries, and hath as ſtrong and forcible power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Offendors in the night as any Iuſtice of peace hath in the day: nay if any Lord, Knight, or Gentleman of what degree, or faſhion ſoeuer he bee, comming in the night-time through the watch in an vnruly faſhion is as ſubiect to his command and authority as the pooreſt ſubiect that walkes the ſtreetes: and if hee ſhould not ſometimes nay many times clappe vp ſuch perſonages, they would be thought very ſlacke in their office and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2156:30"/>
not worthy of that authoritie, and power the King hath giuen them; for many men though they haue braue outſides may commit or act as great, or more hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous miſchiefe then thoſe that are of a poore ranke, for if the Conſtable ſhould not ſtand Centinell, how many men would beerob'd in the ſpace of one weeke, nay of one night, which by his induſtry and care hee preſerues. But here it is obiected that the Beadle and Watchmen haue for euery man they commit a groat, whether it be true or falſe I neuer could confidently ſpeake of, if they haue, it is fit that for ſo many nights as they ſit vp for the good of the Commonwealth they ſhould haue ſomething allowed, and who is the fitteſt to allow it but ſuch as haue offended and they haue beene troubled with the night before: Againe you ſay they will commit ſuch as haue no mony to giue them, though it be vpon a ſleight occaſion, and let ſuch paſſe though their fault bee neuer ſo heynous ſo they will greaſe them in the fiſt. This obiection I will thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, if this abuſe is offered it cannot enter into my minde that the Conſtable hath any hand in it, for there are many occaſions that may call him away after his watch is ſet, and he that is his Deputy may commit the offence (knowing not what truely belongs to his office or place) and if ſometimes they let a Drunkard eſcape without going to priſon, it is a thouſand to one but they that conduct him to his lodging will haue the houſe-Keeper, paſſe his word for his comming foorth in the morning to anſwere what ſhall bee laide to his charge before the Iuſtice: and I thinke a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſter or a ſhilling is well beſtowed vpon them for ſuch a curteſie: againe if they chance to let any vnruly Gallant paſſe, it is either vpon his ſubmiſſion to the Conſtable or his Deputy, or elſe he muſt alledge ſome firme and conſtant reaſon what the occaſion is of his being ſo late out of his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And though there are many men hurt in the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2156:30"/>
watch, the fault lies moſt of all in themſelues and not in the Watchmen, for when a company of Gallants come from ſome Tauerne, or worſe place high gon in wine, and will not render an account of their walking at ſuch an vntimely ſeaſon, but draw their ſwords and fall to hacking them, therefore they are bound firſt of all by the Kings lawes to apprehend them, and ſecondly by the law of nature to defend themſelues, and rather of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend then to bee offended. Thus haue I anſwered your obiectious deſiring to draw to an end, for this is a ſubiect I haue no firme or ſollid ground to worke on, if Conſtables, Beadles, and Watchmen, are conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or guilty of theſe obiections I haue defended, I deſire they may amend and correct them and giue no occaſion to haue any pen buſie it ſelfe in deſcribing the abuſes; thus haue I ſet foorth in order the foure armes that pay tribute to the Ocean the Compter, now will I come to the Compter it ſelfe.</p>

               <p>NOw I haue croſt the armes of this maine Ocean the Compter I will ſaile in the Ocean it ſelfe; and well may the Compter hold ſimilitude with the Sea, for as the Sea is oftentimes diſturbed with ſtormes, guſts, and tempeſts, ſo is the Compter with continuall ſtormes of griefe; guſts of ſorrow, and tempeſts of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation which are continually beating vpon the head and heart of many a poore Priſoner. The Sea as <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers</hi> hold is rul'd by the Moone and according to

the nature of her fourequarters, ſhe doth ebbe and flow, riſe or fall, ſo is the Compter maintained by the Law and the foure-Tearmes, and according to their nature and property, it is full and empty. The ſea hath many fearefull and hideous monſters in it, ſo hath the Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an abundance of Sergeants. In the Sea the great ones eate vp the little ones, ſo in the Compter the Iay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors and Officers feed vpon the poore Priſoners. In the Sea there are many rocks and quickſands, ſo in the Compter is the booke where many poore men pay their fees, and the Paper houſe where he hath his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge: in the Sea there are many ſhippes caſt away by wracks and tempeſts, ſo in the Compter are many men by extortion and cruell Creditors: And laſtly, as in a ſtorme at ſea a braue ſhippe Royall-well man'd that hath ſtore of skilfull Marriners and a good Pilot may ride out the fury and rage of the tempeſt when a poore rotten weatherbeaten Pinke deſtitute of Anchor, ſailes, munition, men and Skilfull Pilots, is ſoone drowned: So in the Compter in the moſt horredſt wracke of affliction, a rich man well friended, well monyed (his chiefeſt Pilot) may make way through the fearefulleſt ſtorme of aduerſity, and come againe to the Port and Hauen of Liberty, while the poore man deſtitute of friends and mony is ſoone caſt away in a ſmall brunt and ſhocke of aduerſitie: but now to the matter.</p>

the other, for I thinke there are as many ſinnes looking through the grates of a Priſon as there are walking through the gates of a City: For though we are all Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners yet the cauſes of our reſtraint are diuers, ſome are in for debt, ſome for other more heynous and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall actions, ſome there are that are in vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, and ſuch are they that come in for debt and can no way ſhunne what they ſuffer, or haue no meanes to giue ſatisfaction to their Creditors: Others there are that are voluntary and ſuch are they that come in of purpoſe, who (if it pleaſe themſelues) may keepe themſelues out, of which I finde foure kinde of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that are good ſubiects to this Commonwealth the Compter, and they are theſe, the firſt your ſubtile Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen, the ſecond your riotous-Vnthrift, the third your politicke High way-man, and the fourth and laſt your crafty mechanicke.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe is the firmeſt legge the body of this Commonwealth doth ſtand vpon, for after hee hath been a Tradſman ſome fiue or ſix yeeres or longer, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing borne vp his head as high as his neighbours, hath had good credit on the Exchange among the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and continually paying them at the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, may if it pleaſe him (hauing kept his word ſo faithfully with them) haue what goods he pleaſeth at halfe a yeere or yeeres day of payment: at laſt when he finds his beſt oppo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

a ſummer together for his owne pleaſure, and when hee heares of any writs that are out for him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes againe to the Cittie, and lies cloſe making none acquainted with his lodging but ſome man he knowes will breake before the next quarter, and imploies this partie to go to his Creditors to certifie them of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie he is in, and that by truſting young Gentlemen he hath vndone himſelfe, deſiring them to bee good to him, proteſting that they ſhall haue all that is left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them if they will be content to let him walke the ſtreetes quietly to vſe ſome meanes to raiſe his fortunes once againe: his Creditors perhaps giues his friendes good wordes telling him they will not be rough with him hoping with this baite to catch my cittizen abroad and ſo clappe him vp, which my Bankrupt little cares for, knowing that after he hath laine in priſon a yeere or two they will be glad to take a quarter of their debts and let him out, what cares he for Actions, Executions, Iudgements, Statutes, or any other Writs, hee hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to keepe himſelfe in priſon and will make them come to compoſition with him as hee liſt himſelfe, or they get none at all, ſo his Creditors at laſt ſeeing his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution ſo fixt and ſetled will (though very loath) take one quarter of their debts rather then looſe all, and it may bee not halfe of that in mony, but young Gentlemens bonds, and deſperate debts that God knowes whether they ſhall euer recouer one penny: thus doe many Banrupts ly in diuers priſons about this Towne inriching themſelues, and by their policie are good for nothing but to defraud his Maieſties ſubiects, and fatten a loathſome priſon, and this is the firſt of theſe voluntary Souldiers.</p>
               <p>The ſecond of theſe are ſuch that will compound with a braſe of Sergeants to arreſt them, and ſuch are many young Gentlemen that want mony to ſupply ſome vitious vſe or other (knowing they haue kinde
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2156:32"/>
friends) will voluntarily haue an action enter'd againſt them and be arreſted, ſo perhaps will lye there a day or two while their friends heare of it, who if it bee but a matter of foure or fiue pound will not ſticke to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it, which being no ſooner done but ſtraight they go to the party to whom the mony was paide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there giue the Sergeant an Angell, and ſhare the reſt among themſelues, many trickes of this kinde haue I ſeen put in practiſe ſince I came hither; but one thing I will not forget which was this: One of theſe fellowe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that had vſed this tricke three or foure ſeuerall times, and beene fetcht out by his friends for ſeuerali ſummes of mony, did once more put it in practiſe, which his friends (at laſt) perceiuing, let him lie there ſome two or three yeeres together, and the moſt part of his impriſonment was in the Hole, and if at laſt he had not got off cleere by his owne induſtry he might haue beene a Priſoner there while this time for all them. How ſay you ſir was not this a pretty tricke? yes faith ſir (ſaid I) I would all ſuch voluntary priſoners might be ſeru'd ſo, but (good ſir) to the third of theſe voluntaries.</p>
               <p>The thirſt ſort of theſe are ſuch that hauing beene in priſon, and lying in the Hole haue beene releaſed by Legacies, but being freed and feeling theſweetneſſe of it, will purpoſely once a yeere (as about Chriſtmas or Eaſter, when they know Legacies come in) get ſome friend of theirs to arreſt them for a matter of thirty or forty ſhillings and then make ſuite to the Marchants (that yearely come and releaſe priſoners if their debts be not aboue that value) which if they get, they haue ſo much mony cleere to bee merry with. Theſe baſe trickes are vſuall though they be not lookt into, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, for it is an extreame wrong firſt to the party that giues it in cheating of him, and ſecondly in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding other poore Priſoners that lie in for due debts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:2156:33"/>The fourth and laſt ſort of theſe are young Gallants that now and then will make a ſteppe to <hi>Newmarket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heath</hi> or ſome ſuch place, and after they haue that they long lookt for, come poſting to <hi>London,</hi> and if the <hi>hews</hi> and <hi>

Thus haue I laide downe in my beſt methode the nature of theſe volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Priſoners that fatten this Common-wealth the Compter Sir (ſaid I) theſe reports ſtrike mee into a maſement: I proteſt I thought there could not haue beene ſuch villany extant in a Realme much leſſe in a priſon: But I hope ſir you are come to treat of the Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, I am ſir, ſaid he, and thus began.</p>

are as nigh a kinne to Sergeants as Brokers are to Vſurers, both of them are inſeparable purſeleaches, and are men that hauing runne through their trades as they haue their eſtates, at laſt are forced to take vpon them this moſt baſe, and odious kinde of life, which they no ſooner haue obtained but are as proud of it, as a louſie priſoner of a freſh ſute, or a beggerly Rimer of tweluepenny dole when hee oweth ninepence for ale. They are men that haue no quality in them but one, and that is to aske mony, and like Lawyers without their fees will doe nothing. They imitate Rauens, Kites and Crowes that feede vpon the corruption, ſtinking garbige and guts of any carrion lying in the fields, and leaue that part that is moſt wholeſome vntouch't, ſo theſe feed vpon the follies and vices of the age, &amp; haue nothing to doe with any thing that is good. If a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman come into their Confines that hath his purſe well lined with crownes they will haue no more mercy ouer him then a Dog killer hath ouer a diſeaſed Curre in the plague time. Which makes me call to mind that <hi>Motto</hi> I haue often ſeene and read <hi>Homo homini Lupus</hi> man is to man a Wolfe. If a man ſhould trauell into the Wilderneſſe or ſome vaſt deſert, and bee deuoured by ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me Reare, or Boare, or ſuch like ſauage Creature, it were but their kinde to doe ſo being prickt and ſtung with hunger; But for one man like a Canniball to feed vpon the other, what more monſtrous and worſe then crueltie is this which euery day is ſeene in this place. Yet in their crueltie they will vſe deliberation and feed vpon a man while he hath mony, and make as dainty of him as a Spaniard will of a piece of beife or mutton, and make many ſweete meales of him: Or like ſome cruell Surgeons that haue a rich man in cure of ſome dangerous diſeaſe, will not at firſt ſend him to purge in another aire, but let him by lingring, and as they call them with their compounding plaiſters make him

ſmart while they haue got more money from him, and while they haue drawne his life to the laſt thread, and thinke here is no more to be got out of him, ſtraight poſt him to his graue; ſo Iaylors when a mans mony is ſpent turne him into the Hole.</p>
               <p>Sir (ſaid I) I haue ſeene ſome of their doings ſince I came hither, and haue admired they ſhould bee ſo hardened that their hearts cannot bee mollified with the oile of compaſſion, no nor cut with the Diamond of compunction, or that they haue no ſenſe or feeling of their owne inhumanity and hard-heartedneſſe, nor once thinke that God may one day make them in as wretched a plight as thoſe they thus tyrannize ouer. Sir (ſaid he) you ſhall ſeldome ſee a Butchers-dogge that continually lies in the ſhambles without a bloudy mouth, and thoſe Officers that liue in this place hauing once their finger dipt in the blood-boule of crueltie, ſeldome or neuer can be reduced to a milder kinde of vſage: Cuſtome is a ſecond nature with them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they daily do it they thinke it is as naturall with them as their meate and drinke.</p>
               <p>But I will leaue their ſtrickt dealing with old Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners while an other time, and come to their vſage and behauiour to new-come Priſoners at their firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance.</p>
               <p>At the firſt entrance of any man into this Dedalean Labyrinth, after they haue viewed him and know his name, then according to the faſhion of his cloaths (but moſt eſpecially the weight of his purſe) they beare themſelues towards him, Flies neuer come to painted gallipots for their gay outſides, but their ſweet inſides as ſuckets, ſugars, and other preſerues, ſo theſe rather reſpect the purſe, then the perſon; for they had rather know he hath a ſiluer inſide then ſee him to haue a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den outſide. If they know hee hath good friends that will not ſee him want, or that hee hath meanes of his
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2156:34"/>
owne correſpondent to their expectation, they will fawne and flatter him in euery reſpect more then a funerall ſermon will a dead man; he ſhall want nothing while he wants not money, euery Officer will haue a cappe and a knee for him, euery time they ſee him hee ſhall command all the houſe be <hi>Dominus fac totum,</hi> what abuſe ſoeuer he offers ſhall be ſmothered ſuffering him to doe any wrong, yet take none, when a poore man for the leaſt offence ſhall be clapt into irons, and caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hole, and there ſhall remaine while ſuch time he ſubmits himſelfe in all humilitieto Maſter Keeper.</p>
               <p>If they ſee a young Nouice come in, who liberally and freely will pay all the large fees of the houſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much asking, and ſometimes greaſe their perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all dry palmes with a teſter or a ſhilling, he ſhall not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly command their hats, but alſo their hearts, a couert paraſite will not be more ſubmiſſe to his beſt Patrone then theſe Compter Spaniells will bee before ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe prodigalls. But if a Gentleman of a rectified and ſollid vnderſtanding chance to be arreſted, and being demanded the fees and garniſh ſtand vpon interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories with them, asking them what warrant they can ſhew for the taking of ſuch mony (being loath to caſt away his mony) they will inſtantly anſwere it is a cuſtome. A cuſtome! Oh heauens is cuſtome become Law, and muſt it becauſe it is vſuall with them be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them to grinde the faces of his Maieſties ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, who will not for the moſt part ſtand and capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with them but rather condeſcend to them ſo they may get good vſage of them, and when they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged neuer thinke of their abuſe, but are glad they haue got from them, and will rather leaue their cruelty to be puniſhed by Gods hand then the Lawes.</p>
               <p>I deſire to know the reaſon, why, when a Gentleman comes to the Maſterſide he muſt before hee is ſuffered to come into the dining roome pay twelue pence for
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2156:35"/>
turning the key, which not long ſince was but a groat, by what authoritie or warrant are they now to take two groats more then there due: nay indeede, why ſhould they haue any at all, becauſe I neuer read in any place in the ſtatutes of England that ſuch fees are due, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hauing no warrant from thence, I admire they dare venture to take that which may turne to their vndoing, if any Informer ſhould proſecute this extortion againſt them.</p>
               <p>Againe, ſuppoſe a man payes the ſhilling is deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him by the porter, why ſhould hee pay for his bed the firſt night two ſhillings (which extortion is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided betweene the cheefe Keeper and the Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine his ſeruant) they can yeeld none other reaſon but this, that it is a cuſtome: and if they bee hardly put to it, they will ſay that is the pleaſure of the Sheriffes, on my conſcience they doe be lye their Worſhipfull Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, for though they are Maſters of the Houſe where priſoners are, yet they are not Maſters of their purſes: beſides no man can bee ſo ignorant and ſimple, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that they will deuiſe lawes of themſelues, for which they haue no warrant out of the ſtatutes: beſides the ſtatutes of the Compter were wont fiue yeeres ſince to hang in the yard, that euery man might ſee what was<note place="margin">Priſoners v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed worſe then ſlaues, whoſe price appeareth written on their backes.</note> due to the houſe and euery officer, but now they are cut downe and buried in obliuion, that they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand what they liſt, which they cannot iuſtifie, for if they could, they would when they are put to it, ſtand to the vertue of their authoritie and office, which not long ſince I ſaw tryed, which euer ſince made mee confidently beleeue, that no ſuch large fees (they vſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take) are due to them.</p>
               <p>For a Gentle-man (they afterward clapt into the Hole, becauſe hee plainely and boldly tolde them of their abuſes) being arreſted came into the Maſter ſide, &amp; being demanded his fees and garniſh, which hee very

               <p>The Chamberlaine (the cheefeſt officer on that ſide) be gan to take the repulfe very hainouſly, and thought he would one way or other be euen with him, making no account that hee ſhould loſe his fees by him, earely the next morning before the Gentleman was vp, came into his chamber, where he found him ſleeping, and his cloake (the marke he ſhot at) lying on the table by him, ſo tooke it vp and went downe ſtaires againe, but when the Gentle-man was awake, and began to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ready, he found his cloake miſſing, ſo that hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to enquire of his chamber-fellowes if they ſaw it not, but they denied it, at laſt he had intelligence that the Chamberlaine had got it for his fees, vpon this hee firſt went and demanded his cloake of him, who refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to deliuer it, vnleſſe he would pay him his garniſh, for, quoth hee, you haue met with no fooles, no faith, ſaid the Gentle man, I rather think I am come among a crue of cunning knaues, and vnleſſe you redeliuer me my cloake againe, I will make ſome of you appeare ſo before yours and my betters.

And that the world may know this is no fiction of mine owne inuention that I haue related, I will tell the name of him that did this, who was one M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Venard</hi> (that went by the name of <hi>Englands Ioy</hi>) that afterward died heere in miſery, plagued by the Keepers, being more guilty of his death then his cruell aduerſaries, for after hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to tell them of that they were loath to heare of, they thruſt him into the Hole, being in winter, where lying without a bedde, hee caught ſuch an extreame cold in his legges, that it was not long before he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this life.</p>
               <p>Now I would know of them, if their fees had beene due, why did they not ſtand to the maintaining of their due, or if the Sheriffes did appoint ſuch fees to bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why did they not appeale to him, and deſire his aide in the matter, and ſince that time why did they not procure of him that the Articles might bee hung vp by the gate, that all priſoners as ſoone as they are brought in vpon an arreſt or command, may read them and not ſtand in contention, but paie what the Right Worſhipfull Sheriffes and Court of Aldermen thinke fit to be paide.</p>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:2156:36"/>
the Iaylor and no more: this is the iniunction after which followes the penaltie, which is this, (mentioned in the ſame Statute) And if any Iaylor ſhall any waies doe contrarie to this aforeſaid ordinance he ſhall looſe to the partie thus endammaged or greiued his treble dammages, and forfeit forty pound at euery time that any of them doe contrary in any point of the ſame, whereof the Queene ſhall haue one halfe to be emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely to the vſe of her houſe, and the partie that will ſue the other halfe, only the Warden of the <hi>Fleete</hi> and of the Queenes-Pallace at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> for the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhal not be preiudiced by this Ordinance in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his office. Thus you haue heard the iniunction and penaltie of this Statute which was made in King <hi>Henries</hi> the ſixts time, which were in force in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, &amp; which now is of vertue and efficacie in our Soueraigne <hi>Iames</hi> his time, for theſe Statutes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſince they were firſt made in the Honourable houſe of Parliament were repealed: Therefore I admire they knowing the Statutes wil in danger themſelues ſo much euery day as to infringe this ordinance, by the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of which they reape an infinite gaine yearely, for of ſo many thouſands that come into their iuriſdictions they let none ſcape but haue fiue times more then this Statute allowes them, nay ſometimes tenne times, nay twentie times more then they can anſwere; for I haue ſeene ſome men pay ten groates for his fees at booke, ſome ten ſhillings, ſome a marke, ſome twenty ſhillings, nay I haue noted it they haue not beene aſhamed to aske fortie ſhillings for his fees, beſides garniſh, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther charges which will amount to the matter of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or ſeuen ſhillings if hee lie heere but one night, let him go the nigheſt way to worke he can.

for their horrible extortion, and make ſome of the worſt of them (if there can be one worſe then another) examples for the reſt, for no Iaylor will ſtand to triall if he be wiſe, but will rather confeſſe it, and plead guilty, which if he do he confeſſeth his extortion; but if he be ſo valiant as to ſtand to a iuſtification, he hath no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to exceede his limitation. Therefore whether he pleades guilty, or ſtands to his iuſtification he cannot chuſe but ſhew himſelfe an extorter, as on <hi>Carman</hi> that<note place="margin">

For what extreame extortion is it when a Gentleman is brought in by the watch for ſome miſdemeanour committed, and ſtaies but while the next morning, that muſt pay at leaſt an Angell before he be diſcharged, hee muſt pay tweluepence for turning the key at the maſterſide dore, two ſhillings to the Chamberleine, tweluepence for his garniſh for wine, ten pence for his dinner, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſtay or no, and when he comes to be diſcharged at the Booke it will coſt at leaſt three ſhillings and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence more, beſides ſixpence for the Booke-keepers paines, and ſixpence for the Porter. But this abuſe was once complained on by one that had beene wronged in this nature, and my Lord Maior ſent word and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that no man comming in by the watch ſhould be receiued into the maſter-ſide, yet within ſixe or ſeuen weekes after they could not forget their old wont but fell to it againe, imitating the Fox that was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Lyon for killing many geeſe and hens to go a pilgrimage for his ſinnes, yet he could not chooſe but caſt his eyes on euery flocke of geeſe he ſaw graſing on

euery greene he trauelled through, and at laſt for all the Lyons command caſt off his Pilgrimmes weed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had gone halfe his iourney, and fell to his olde trade againe. But they haue other trickes as badde as theſe, which are as followeth: when a Gentleman that hath beene long reſident in the maſterſide, and hath paide all their demand there, and chanceth to be turn'd ouer to the Knights-ward for want of meanes he, muſt be forced to pay all the fees ouer againe, or elſe they will either pull his cloake from his backe, or his hat from his head, and the Steward of that ward will ſtand as peremptorily vpon it as if it were confirmed to him by Act of Parliament, or had it vnder all the Priuie Councells hands: And if a Gentleman ſtay there but one night he muſt pay for his garniſh ſixteene pence beſides a groate for his lodging, and ſo much for his ſheetes, and ſtill he that receiues it, ſaies, it is a cuſtome, &amp; that it is toward the buying of ſuch things he wants. why if it be ſo I thinke euery Priſoner is of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſufficient to buy theſe things himſelfe, and not to truſt his money<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in other mens hands, and ſtand to their kindneſſe for ſuch things he ſhall want; but theſe are onely trickes to get money, for I haue ſeene them put to their <hi>nonplus,</hi> and dared by Gentlemen that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood their dealings to pull their cloakes from their backes, telling them that there was no ſuch exactions due, at which hot repulſe they haue beene as calme as midnight; but if they meete with ſome raw young fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that will ſwallow and digeſt ſuch wrongs they will triumph ouer him, and not let him paſſe while they haue made him open his purſe and giue them their demand.</p>
               <p>When a Gentleman is vpon his diſcharge, and hath giuen ſatisfaction for his executions they muſt haue fees for irons, three-halfe-pence in the pound, beſides the other fees, ſo that if a man were in a thouſand or

fifteene hundred pound execution, they will if a man is ſo madde haue ſo many three-halfe-pence, but I thinke the Keeper of one of the Compters that tooke ſuch vnlawfull fees was forced to pay backe againe what he had receiued with a thouſand thankes as ſoone as hee perceiued he had a <hi>ſubpaena</hi> was ſeru'd vpon him out of the <hi>Exchequor:</hi> Thus if ſome men would but take this order with them, and ierke them with ſuch rods they would learne a better and honeſter leſſon.</p>

               <p>I haue heard it reported, when any Legacies come into the houſe, towards the releaſe of the poore people of the Hole, the Keepers ſometimes takes them into their hands, promiſing thoſe that deliuer them, that they ſhall be layd foorth toward the diſcharge of the poore, but contrary to the wil of the Benefactor decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, releeue not only the poore in the loathſome dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon of the Hole, to whom it was ſoly giuen, but help thoſe out with them that lie in the two-penny ward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they owe them money for their lodging, and ſo not for any good will to them, helpe them to a Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, that they might be payd themſelues out of it, or elſe they might lie there like the reſt of their fellowes. Thus they firſt wrong the charitable Benefactours, that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2156:39"/>
on their death-beds bequeath their bounty to the poor, and laſtly, the poore themſelues, in depriuing them of that which is due to them, in making them ſtay, it may be two months or a quarter of a yeere before they can be releaſed, expecting other Legacies, when as halfe a ſcore or more of them may die before they come in. Againe, I haue heard ſome murmure at their plots, in keeping men in by pollicy that haue ſtore of money, letting them not goe before ſuch time their money is almoſt ſpent, and when their Creditors come to heare of them, will not ſticke to tell them that they haue money enough in their pockets, &amp; that it was fit they ſhould haue their due before they withdrew their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: yet when they ſee his coine begin to waſt, will not ſtand out to perſwade their aduerſaries to take pity of them, and come to ſome reaſonable compoſition: for what ſhould they doe with them when they haue no more caſh: dealing with them as ſome dainty Lady will with a Woodcocke, cares not what becomes of the body, when ſhee hath eaten vp his braines, or as Huntſmen doe with foxes, fling the carkaſſe into ſome ditch or on ſome dunghill, after they hane ſtript his skin ouer his eares. Beſides theſe trickes I haue heard that when a young Gentle-man is arreſted, and hath competent allowance from his friends, as weekely his diet and his lodging diſcharged, they continually will certifie his friends or his father of the leaſt miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he ſhall commit, nay, rather then faile to relate all, will adde more to it, to make it more hainous, ſo that hee might bee incenſed againſt his childe, and ſtill keepe him in priſon, which policy is onely for this cauſe, that they might ſtill haue ſo good a gueſt as hee is, knowing his friends will ſee ſuch things hee cals for truely diſcharged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things (ſay they) are common with them, and when a Tradeſman is arreſted vpon ſeuerall actions
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:2156:39"/>
they will giue (being feed well) intelligence to their <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries</hi> whether they meane to put in baile or no to them, or what they determine to get their releaſe by, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring not what becoms of the poore man, wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſo they themſelues gaine but twelue-pence. Some, ſay they, will not ſticke to take fees of dead men, and ſcarce let the coffin goe out of their gates, before his friends hath payd his fees, therefore if theſe reports bee true, it is firſt moſt abhominable for them to act, and moſt lamentable to heare. Therefore, good Sir, let me haue your aduiſe and opinion in this matter, and truly without any fallacie or equiuocation, whether theſe things I lately was certified, of are true or no, after a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pauſing he began to reſolue me in this manner.</p>
               <p>Indeede Sir, ſome of theſe deuiſes I haue found pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed vpon my ſelfe, but for ſome others, that you haue made mention of I will not boldly warrant to bee true, but you haue heard no more reported then I haue heard ſpoken: but this I can iuſtifie to be true, as a true token and ſigne of their wooluiſh diſpoſition and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gluvious appetites, there cannot a diſh of meat come into the gates, but they muſt and will haue a ſhare of it, nay, and thinke that the poore priſoners are much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to them, that they are ſo much graced, or haue ſo much fauour as to haue them partake with them: but if any man hating their ſociety will neither giue them entertainment, or inuite them to any peece of meate hee ſhall bee ſure to bee lockt vp all that weeke that Keeper waits, and doe him ſome villanous miſchiefe whenſoeuer he conueniently can contriue it. Or on the contrary, if any young nouice that hath no execution againſt him, bee pliant to their humour, they will vſe him with as great a reſpect as any Noble-mans heire, if they ſee him profuſe and riotous, they will not leaue vrging him to go abroad with them to take ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition with his creditors, when Heauen knowes, it is
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:2156:40"/>
not for any good they purpoſe to him, but themſelues. For they vſe him as Anglers doe the fiſh, giue him a bait, but it is for his bane, ſo theſe are kinde, but it is for ſome benefit they expect from him, for they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer goe abroad with any of theſe vnder two ſhillings or halfe a crowne, if they ſtay but an hower with them, beſides in what company ſoeuer they come in, and ſtay at dinner &amp; ſupper, either at an Ordinary or Tauerne, or any friends houſe, they pay not a penny, thus doe they perſwade many abroad with them (that elſe would ſtay at home, I meane in <hi>Priſon</hi>) firſt that they might furniſh their purſes with money, and their bellies with good cheere, and bring them home at night, as bare of money as a ſheepe is of wooll that all day long hath beene feeding among buſhes and briers.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe this man from whom they haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſo much kindneſſe, as good diet, money and other fauours, fall into want and diſtreſſe, doe you thinke they will releeue him, no they will let him lie and break his heart with his owne ſighes, waſh his couch with his owne teares, grinde his teeth into powder, and make himſelfe bread of it to eat, before they will releeue or helpe him, or if by chance they doe releeue any poore man (as it is very ſeldome) they will in a Phareſaicall oſtentation report it to any friend that comes to viſit him.</p>
               <p>I haue ſeene an Embleme, where the picture of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> held in one hand loaues of bread, diſtributing it to the poore ſtanding round about her, and in the other, a Trumpet to report to the world her beneuolence. Such are theſe Iaylours, that vpon the leaſt taſte of friendſhip or kindneſſe ſhewed to a man, will bee ſure to haue all the people in the houſe know of it, yet theſe curteſies come as ſeldome from them, as virgins out of <hi>Pickt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hatch,</hi> or ſound horſes out of <hi>Smith-field.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for one good qualitie they haue ten badde, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:2156:40"/>
what iniury or wrong ſoeuer they doe a man hee muſt not complaine, a rugged behauiour towards them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes not. If a man ruſh through a quicke-ſet hedge in haſt he cannot chuſe but haue his face ſcratcht<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if hee temperately did diuide the buſhes with his hands he might go through without any hurt: when a poore man comes nigh a churliſh maſtiffe he muſt not ſpurne at him if he meane to goe quietly by him, but flatter and ſtroake him on the backe, and ſpit in his mouth: So muſt Priſoners if they meane not to bee prickt with a Iaylors thorny diſpoſition muſt vſe him gently, or if he will not bee bitten with his curriſh and dogged vſage let him giue faire words and ſometimes if he be able flinge a ſoppe or two into his gaping and all-deuouring iawes.</p>
               <p>They doe as all the world elſe, more for money then merit, for I haue ſeene a fellow come in with ſcarce a ragge on his backe being ſome Cheate or Decoy that hath beene preferred to the Maſterſide, becauſe the Keepers knew they of his trade would fetch him out ſpeedily, and pay all the fees: when on the contrary, I haue knowne a Gentleman of good reputation whoſe behauiour and outward habiliments ſhewed his deſert, clapt vp into a darke roome without any light among halfe a ſcore men, and if there were no ſpare bedde for him to lie on, let him take vp his lodging on the bourds which he muſt pay for before he and they part. Other mens miſeries makes them merry, and the more Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners they haue committed the more is their gaine, for I haue often heard them (when my Lord Maiors offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers haue brought in Bakers for making their bread an ounce or two too heauy) whiſper in their eares telling them they haue had but a fewe Priſoners that weeke which is an inſtigation to them, to bring as many as they can poſſible; beſides the Booke-keepers, doe not much ſtand vpon it to giue ſometime a pint or a quart

                  </gap>o by that meanes might looſe a night walker.</p>
               <p>Their cruelty is as great as their policy for I haue heard ſince I haue been Priſoner a poore ſicke man, that not halfe an hower before he died cald about midnight for water to quench his thirſt, yet none of theſehard-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Keepers would riſe to releiue him, but were deafe to his lamentable and ſad complaints: ſo that the poore ſoule before day tooke his leaue of the world. But what comes all the durt and droſſe to, they thus ſcrath and ſcrape together? moſt commonly to nothing, for what they are getting in three or foure yeere they may looſe in an after noone, ſo that it is as rare to ſee a rich laylor, as a droue of fat Oxen in Spaine; for ſometimes when they go abroad with Priſoners for tweluepence or eighteene pence gaine, may looſe them before they come in again, &amp; ſo are forced to compound with their Creditors.

any leaking boate hath in taking water, vouchſafed to receiue his fees, and (to be ſhort) wentabroad with him: the beſt part of the day they ſpent in walking vp and downe the City from friend to friend, yet they could not get ſo much as one ſixpenny piece from any: at laſt to prolong the time, the Priſoner deſired the Keeper but to go with him to one friend more, and there hee made no doubt but to ſpeede: well, away they go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but they found no more mony there then they did at diuers places they had beene at before, ſo that they were comming home againe as emprie of money as they went out: for the Keeper would not ſtay a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute longer when he ſaw there was <hi>non Lariohn</hi> to bee had, ſo he haſtens his Charge to go a little faſter that they might be at home betimes, nay faith ſaid the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner ſeeing you haue been ſo good as to ſtay out with me ſo long, I deſire you to doe me that honeſt office as to go into a Barbers ſhoppe and ſtay while I am trim'd which I haue not been this twelue-moneth, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence you for your paines I will giue you your ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing; the Keeper not refuſing this curteſie thinking to ſaue a groate or ſixpence in his purſe by the bargaine, went with him into the next Barbers ſhoppe they came to, where the Barber after a finnicall congratulation biddes them welcome, and prouides his chaire and his napkins, his combs, and his Sizers, his balls and his ſpunges, and falls firſt about the Priſoners eares: Who being diſpatcht gaue him a teſter and went to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow to put on his band, the Keeper inſtantly vpon his riſing beganne to fall into his roome, and being ſet fell a talking with the Barber about what newes hee heard in the City, but they had not diſcourſed long, but <hi>Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2156:42"/>
time the Priſoner had made himſelfe ready, ſlipt out of doores, went quite away, and was neuer heard of again. Now the Barber had no ſooner tooke the baſen from the Keepers chinne, and was carrying it to the window but the Keeper admiring hee could not heare his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners tongue walke all this while, opened his eyes (venturing a ſmarting) to ſee whether the Priſoner were in the ſhoppe or no, whom hee no ſooner miſt, but vp he ſtarts, runnes out of doores bearing the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ouer and ouer, that came with his raſor in his hand to ſhaue him, and ran into the ſtreetes with the Barbers cloathes about his ſhoulders, with his choppes all white with the froth and ſuddes that hung about them, ſo that he looked like a Boare that foamed at mouth, or a well trauelling horſe, and in this order runnes he mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vp and downe the ſtreete inquiring for his Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Barber followes him for his cloathes, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for his trimming, while euery man, woman, and childe that met him gaue him way, thinking hee had newly broke out of <hi>Bedlam;</hi> but my Barber at laſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertooke him, laide holde on him, and got his cloaths, and his mony of him before he would let him go: and ſo my Keeper was forced to turne backe to the Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without his Priſoner, ſo that when all his fellowes heard the conceit they almoſt laught him out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, beſides the plague he was put to in compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with the Priſoners Aduerſaries.</p>
               <p>But in my conceit the beſt ieſt was of a fellow who was committed to the Compter (for getting a Wench with childe) by a Iuſtice, who ſent this prouiſo to the Keepers, that they ſhould not permit him to go abroad vntill ſuch time hee had put in ſufficient baile to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the Pariſh of the burthen: Now the wench was not yet deliuered but looked euery hower, in the mean time this fellow made continuall ſuite to go abroade to ſeeke baile, at laſt one of the Booke keepers let him go
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:2156:42"/>
to ſome of his friends hauing for his Keeper one of the Meſſengers belonging to the houſe, now the Priſoner being abroad and ſeeing his time and oportunity, moſt nimbly and like an Iriſhfootman betooke himſelfe to his heeles, and ran quite away, I cannot ſay cleane a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, for he was in ſuch a fright that a man might haue ſmelt him a furlong; but to conclude, the Meſſenger went home to the Compter as like an Aſſe as he went out, and brought home the ſadde tidings which was as welcome to the Booke-keeper as a Priſoner that had neuer a penny in his purſe. Well to be ſhort, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh complained of the Keepers negligence, who laide the fault on the Meſſengers head, at laſt it fortuned ſo, that the Wench was brought abedde, but with what in the name of God? by my troth, with two chopping boyes, which the Iuſtice hearing of, to eaſe the Pariſh of ſuch a charge, ſent for the Booke-keeper and the Meſſenger, and made the Booke-keeper keepe one of them, and the Meſſenger the other, and this was their iuſt and righteous doome.</p>
               <p>Thus with my beſt Arte and induſtrie according to my promiſe I haue compiled in as briefe a method as I could the ſtate of the Compters Commonwealth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſing<note place="margin">Compendium, imò ſuſpendiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> the beſt and chiefeſt ſubiects belonging to it, as <hi>ſubtile Citizens, politicke Prodigalls, villanous Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,</hi> and <hi>officious Conſtables</hi> and <hi>Beadles</hi> which are the foure maine Pillars that ſupport it: then I diſcourſed to you of the nature of the place it ſelfe and the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, their extortion, and crueltie: I could now relate to you the villany of the Meſſengers, that are members of the ſame body, who inſteed of going to mens friends with letters (which concernes their liberty or reliefe) will ſit drinking in ſome Alehouſe and neglect their buſines, which it may be is a perpetuall vndoing to the poore man.

               <p>HE that would ſee the ſtrange miracles of God, let him take ſome long voiage to ſea, and hee that would ſee the miſeries of man let him come into this place the Hole, that ſtinkes many men to death, and is to all that liue in it, as the Dog daies are to the world, a cauſer of diſeaſes, except a few whom I haue ſeene ſo ſtout and tough (ſtinkeproofe, nay plagueproofe I thinke) that no infection could pierce their hearts. <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> when it was ſackt had not more calamities feeding vpon her heart then this place, and I thinke it was the true <hi>Idea</hi> and ſhaddow of this loathſome Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon we liue in, for as there as pinching famine in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rujalem,</hi> ſo in this place there are many men that for want of ſuſtenance vtterly periſh. In <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> there was ſickneſſe, ſo in this place a man ſhall not looke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him but ſome poore ſoule or other lies groaning and labouring vnder the burthen of ſome dangerous diſeaſe, the childe weeping ouer his dying Father, the mother ouer her ſicke childe, one friend ouer an other, who can no ſooner riſe from him, but hee is ready to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:2156:44"/>
ſtumble ouer an other in as miſerable a plight as him he but newly tooke his leaue of, ſo that if a man come thither he at firſt will thinke himſelfe in ſome Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard that hath beene fatned with ſome great plague, for they lie together like ſo many graues. In <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> the warres ruined millions of ſoules, ſo in this place the continuall warre that hard hearted Creditors make againſt the liues of their poore debters deſtroy many wretched and moſt miſerable Creatures: and as in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> a mother was forced through hunger to eate her owne childe to ſaue her owne life, ſo in this place one man is ready to prey vpon the other, ſo that they walke vp and downe like ſo many Ghoſts for want of food to relieue them. Laſtly in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> were inteſtine<note place="margin">And fighting againſt vs in our owne clothes.</note> ſeditions, ſo here innumerable aſſaults of our home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred friends deſcended from our owne fleſh. But (Sir ſaid I) I haue heard it reported for truth that there are many liuing in that place that go Gentleman-like, haue money continually in their purſes, eate good meate, liue as merrily as the beſt of the houſe, if this be true it cannot chuſe but hinder them from much charity that elſe would be ſent vnto them, for what neede charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Benefactors ſend them meanes when ſo many of them go ſo neate and hanſome, for it is not giuen them to lay on their backes but to put into their bellies, for in ſuch a place the courſeſt garments are the beſt: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine (they ſay) there is a certaine company of them that take what they liſt themſelues of what reliefe ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer comes in, and the reſt as the pooreſt, haue their lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings, ſo then this is obiected to bee one of the chiefe cauſes that there is ſuch continuall ſickneſſe, pouerty, and famine there: And laſtly, that what meanes or money ſoeuer comes in to them, in the ſpace of an hower after will either in wine, beere, or Tobacco make themſelues drunke for the preſent time, which is the cauſe they faſt a weeke after, therefore good ſir re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2156:44"/>
me theſe doubts, and I ſhall ceaſe to trouble you any more: He inſtantly condiſcended and thus began to anſwere me.</p>
               <p>Sir (ſaid he) it is granted that there be ſome in this place that go decent and hanſome, but you muſt not be perſwaded that they get it from ſuch charities as are ſent in to them, their owne indeauours and labours procures it them, and it may be ſome of them as they haue liued like Gentlemen abroad, ſo they would bee glad to ſhew themſelues ſtill though they be in priſon: Beſides, their friends ſometimes furniſh them with ſuch neceſſaries as are fit to keepe them cleane, and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. Againe, whereas you ſay that there are ſome of them haue what they liſt, and leaue what they diſlike to the poore, is not to be credited, for there is nothing that comes in but the youngeſt hath as great a ſhare as the eldeſt (I as Maſter Steward himſelfe) therefore whoſoeuer informed you of this, ſpake it out of enuie towards vs, yet wee confeſſe at <hi>Eaſter',</hi> or <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> when any good Legacie comes in, it is fitteſt that thoſe Priſoners that haue beene of fiue or ſixe yeeres ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſhould haue the profit of it before ſuch as haue beene there but two or three moneths, and this breeds a mutiny many times among them, becauſe the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt hath not that priuiledge the eldeſt ought to haue. And laſtly, whereas you alledge how riotous they liue there when they haue mony, may be very well denied: for they haue no money deliuered into their hands, but into the Stewards diſpoſing, who carefully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uides them ſuch neceſſaries as they want, onely at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> and <hi>Eaſter</hi> or ſuch times when the liberality of the Cittie is more ample then at any other time of the yeere elſe, they (though vnwillingly) may fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome error being kept from a full diet ſo long time as many of them are And now Sir I hope I haue cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your doubts, therefore now I will proceede to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:2156:45"/>
the gouernment of the place.</p>
               <p>This little Hole is as a little Citty in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, for as in a Citty there are all kinde of Officers trades and vocations, ſo there is in this place, as we may make a pretty reſemblance betweene them. In ſteede of a Lord Maior we haue a Maſter Steward to ouer-ſee and correct all ſuch miſdemeanours as ſhall ariſe, hee is a very vpright man in his dealings though he ſtoope in his body, but the weight of the office he beares is the cauſe he bends, which is a great ſigne of humilitie. And as the Cittie hath twelue Companies that exceede all the reſt for authoritie, antiquitie, and riches; ſo hath this place twelue old Priſoners that helpe the Steward in his proceedings, who by the generall voice of the houſe rule and beare ſway ouer all the reſt; and heere as in a Cittie is Diuine ſeruice ſaid euery euening, and morning; heere as in a Citty is a commanding Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, that vpon any miſdemeanours offered by any man either to the Steward, or the Twelue ſhall bee brauely mounted and haue ten pounds with a purſe, that the print of their iuſtice ſhall ſticke vpon his but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tockes foure and twenty howers after. And laſtly as in a Citty there is all kindes of Trades, ſo is there heere, for heere you ſhall ſee a Cobler ſitting mending olde ſhowes, and ſinging as merrily as if hee were vnder a ſtall abroad; not farre from him you ſhall ſee a Taylor ſit croſſe-legged (like a Witch) on his cuſhion, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ruine of our fellow Priſoners the Aegyptian vermine: In an other place you may behold a Sadler empannelling all his wits together how to patch this Scotchpadde hanſomely, or mend the olde Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Crooper that was almoſt burſt in pieces: You may haue a Phiſition here that for a pottle of ſack will vndertake to giue you as good a medicine for melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly as any Doctour will for fiue pound, and make you purge vpward and downeward as well as if you
<pb n="[83]" facs="tcp:2156:45"/>
had taken downe into your guts all the drugges in <hi>Loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi> Beſides if you deſire to bee remoued before a Iudge you ſhall haue a Tinker-like Atturney not farre diſtant from you, that in ſtopping vp one Hole in a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken cauſe will make twenty before hee hath made an end, and at laſt will leaue you in priſon as bare of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as he himſelfe is of honeſty: Heere is your Chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke Cooke that will dreſſe our meate when wee can get any as well as any greaſie Scullion in <hi>Fleetlane</hi> or <hi>Pyecorner.</hi> And twentie more then theſe there are, which for breuitie ſake I will leaue out, becauſe I would diſcourſe vnto you the maieſtie and ſtate of theſe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, when euery Saterday at night they ſit in counſell about their affaires, and thus it is.</p>
               <p>About the time that <hi>Bowbell</hi> ſummons the toaſt and butter Eaters to ſhut vp their ſhoppes, the Councell beginne to flocke together, and then the youngeſt man of the Twelue prouides a broome and makes the little cockeloft as cleane as any Cittizens wiues chamber in the Towne, then ſpreads a greene carpet on the board not much bigger then a Horſes ſaddle-cloath iuſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the place the Steward ſits in, and then takes three or foure ſtoopes in his hands and trudges downe to the Cellar, calling for the beſt liquor, telling <hi>Froath</hi> the Tapſter that it is for Maſter Steward and the reſt of his brethren, who giues them of the beſt becauſe they are his beſt Cuſtomers: when he hath his full load of drink I meane his armes and not his head full, away he goes to the Councell-chamber not forgetting to carry with him halfe a dozen papers of Tobacco: Hauing aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Ladder in a moſt comely order hee places the Canns on the Table, and fills halfe a ſcore pipes of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, thus hauing all things in readineſſe he requeſts the Steward and the reſt of the Twelue to comevp, who being aſcended beginne to ſucke out the braines of the barrells to adde to their owne, and light the
<pb n="[84]" facs="tcp:2156:46"/>
pipes and let them go merrily round. The reaſon that they drinke ſo much before they determine of any thing, is this, that they may the eaſier caſt vp their rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konings; and why they drinke ſo much Tobacco, is, that if any man be brought before them for any abuſe committed, they might ſmoake him ſoundly. When they haue deuoured all their drinke, and Trinidado, they ſift and boult out what expences they haue beene at that weeke, what pepper, ſalt, vineger, faggots, and candles they haue ſpent, how many dozen of bread, ſheepes gathers, and barrells of foureſhillings beere they haue had brought in that weeke. This buſineſſe of moment diſpatched, the youngeſt of the priuie Councell calls vp all ſuch as haue had wrong done them any time that weeke, and preferres their bills of complaint vp to the whole body of the Councell, or elſe are permitted to relate, but with all modeſty and deliberation, the nature of the offence, and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing their witneſſes, ſhall without all partiality haue the Law paſſe vpon the Offender, who muſt either fine for the fault, or if he be not worth ſo much, will make his poſteriours pay for it. If any man be knowne to be a common Drunkard he ſhall, if he be able, fine for it, or elſe his puniſhment ſhall be to go a dry while he can get mony to quench his thirſt, or elſe muſt either drink water, or choake. If any man ſteale any of his fellowes meate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if it be knowne he ſhall fine for it, but if hee be not able, the Twelue will take ſuch order with him that hee gets not a penny loafe three daies after. Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer forſweares himſelfe if hee be able, hee ſhall fine for it, if hee be not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall go and be damn'd as long as hee ſtayes in the houſe, and neuer haue ſo much credit as runne one penny on the Tapſters ſcore.</p>
               <p>Againe if they chance to fall together by the eares themſelues about any thing they enact, ſo that they beat the Canns about each others eares, they will not
<pb n="[85]" facs="tcp:2156:46"/>
long beare enuie in their hearts, but at the approach of the other halfe doſen quench that fire of debate, drinke a health to ſome of their beſt Benefactours, ſhake hands, be ſworne friends, breake vp Councell for that night, and go to their beddes (if they haue any.)</p>
               <p>Thus haue I beguiled the time, and I feare my ſelfe, in relating to you the true nature of the Hole, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie of it; my defence to the ſlanderous obiections, and the authoritie and iuſtice of the Steward and the Twelue, therefore I will touch one point more and draw to a concluſion. But as hee was going forward in his diſcourſe the Bell of the Maſter-ſide range to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and by this meanes wee were both called vp; ſo I promiſed him ſecreſie as hee intreated mee, made an end of our ſacke, put a ſmall token of my loue into his hand, ſo he went to his Hole, and I to my Ward, but I no ſooner was entered into my chamber, but with all expedition I tooke penne, inke, and paper, writing what I could remember of his diſcourſe, which I haue made bold to publiſh to the world, hoping that thoſe that read it will not thinke a miſſe of mee for ſetting it foorth, for I doubt not but if it be ſeriouſly peruſed, it will giue true content to them. So remembring my beſt loue and ſeruice to all thoſe that affect me, and my willing labours, I reſt theirs to bee commanded, and remaine their poore and then impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned friend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
