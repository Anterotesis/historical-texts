            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>QUERIES concerning TYTHES TO THE Prieſts and Bishops.</head>
            <p n="1">I. WAs not Tythes to be paid to the Levites which had no Lot amongſt the reſt of the Tribes? And was not the decayed Widows, and Fatherleſs, and Strangers, which had no Lot, to have part with the Levites in their Lot? and ſo eat, and drink, and praiſe the Lord together, the Tythes being the Lords.</p>
            <p n="2">II. And did not Chriſt come to end the Levitical Prieſthood that took Tythes? And did he not end Tythes, and the Command that gave them, and alſo the Law by which the Prieſthood was made? And ſo did not Chriſt put down all?</p>
            <p n="3">III. And was not Tythes called a Heave-offering, and a Shake-offering, and a Wave-offering? And did not Chriſt by offering up himſelf once for all the Off<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rings, end all? Not onely the Offerings of Bulls and Goats, but the Heave an<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Shake-offerings of Tythes? And if ſo; then do not they that hold up the Heave-offering of Tythes, and Wave-offering, deny Chriſt come in the Fleſh, and offered up once for all?</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Did any receive Tythes, or pay Tythes, but only the Jews, by the Command of God? Or had ever the Gentiles Prieſts a Command to receive Tythes, or the people of the Gentiles to pay them to them? Or are we outward Jews? Or are they the outward Prieſts and Levites to whom we muſt pay Tythes now?</p>
            <p n="5">V. Or if you hold that Tythes are not to be paid <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> as you formerly plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but by the Law of the Nation, then do you make that Law not to be of God, and ſo not being <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> is it not <hi>Jure Diaboli,</hi> and from the corrupt nature and power? and how can that be called Civil Right, which is not civilized by the power of God?</p>
            <p n="6">VI. And if you ſay the Law commands them to be paid to God and holy Church; will you ſay the Prieſts and Biſhops are God and the Church? would not this be ridiculous? ſeeing the Poor hath no part, the Widow and Stranger hath no part, according to the Law of God; and that though the Jews were as the Stars of Heaven, and the Sand of the Sea, yet the decayed Widows and Fatherleſs, who had no Lot, were to have their Lot with <hi>Levi</hi> of the Tythes, that there might not be a Begger amongſt them.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. And after Chriſt Jeſus had ended the firſt Prieſthood, Offerings and Tythes; and they that were believers in him, called Chriſtians; was there not another proviſion made for the poor amongſt the Chriſtians then Tythes? as you may ſee in the firſt Converſion, and the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, that there might not be a Begger among the Chriſtians, according to the Goſpel order, and Law of Jeſus, as you ſee in the <hi>Acts,</hi> from the counſel of the Apoſtles, when they ſaid, <hi>Chuſe you ſeven men, fearing God, hating covetouſneſs, full of the Holy Ghoſt, to be ſet over the Chriſtians at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>to ſee that nothing be lacking among them</hi>; and if nothing be lacking, all is well.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. Did Chriſt give any ſuch Command either among the Chriſtian Jews, or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Gentiles, that they ſhould receive or pay Tythes? or was there any mention of Tythes among the Chriſtians for ſeveral hundred years after Chriſt? and was not the firſt paying of them in <hi>England,</hi> for praying of peoples Souls out of Purgatory?</p>
            <p n="9">IX. And hath not Chriſt ſaid to his Miniſters, <hi>Freely you have received, freely give?</hi> And doth not the Apoſtle ſay, he <hi>coveted no man, Silver, nor Gold, nor apparel, that he might be an example to all that came after him?</hi> And alſo ſaid to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> how Biſhops ſhould be qualified, <hi>Not covetous, not greedy of filthy lucre?</hi> And ſo here have not the Teachers and Prieſts of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> forſaken that Order of Jeſus, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, who take Tythes of peoples Eſtates, and will not preach without them; and alſo take away the Tenths of them they do not preach to; and if they will not pay them, ſue them, and caſt them into Priſon? And would not ſuch, if they had been in the Apoſtles dayes been ridiculous, <hi>who ſerve not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own Bellies?</hi> And if they were not juſtifiable then, how are they now?</p>
