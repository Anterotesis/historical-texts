            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit the Assembling, Continuing, and Dissoluing of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> be a Prerogatiue so peculiarlie belonging to Our Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Crowne, and the times and seasons thereof so absolutelie in Our owne power, that we need not giue account therof vnto any: yet, according to Our continuall custome, to make Our good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects acquainted with the reasons of all Our publike resolutions &amp; actions; We haue thought it expedient at this time to declare, not only Our pleasure and resolution therein, grounded vpon mature deliberation, with the aduice and vniforme consent of Our whole Priuie Councell; but therewith also to note some especiall procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings moouing Us to this resolution: And that chieflie to this end, that as God, so the World may witnesse with Us, that it was Our intent to haue made this the happiest Parliament, that euer was in Our time: And that the lettes, and impediments thereof being discerned, all misunderstandings and iealousies might bee remooued, and all Our people may know and beleeue, that We are as farre from imputing any of those ill acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, that haue happened in Parliament, to any want or neglect of duty, or good affection towards Us, by them in generall, or by the greater and better number of Parliament men, as we are confident (the true causes discouered) they wilbe far from imputing it to any default in Us; there hauing in the beginning of this late Assemblie passed greater and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible tokens of loue and duty from Our Subiects to Us their Soueraigne, and more remarkeable testimonies from Us of Our Princely care and zeale of their welfare, then haue beene in any Parliament met in any former Age.</p>
            <p>This Parliament was by Us called, as for making good and profitable Lawes, so more especially, in this time of miserable distraction throughout Christendome, for the better setling of peace and Religion, and restoring Our Children to their ancient and lawfull patrimony, which We attempted to procure by peaceable treaty, at Our owne excessiue charge, thereby to saue and preuent the effusion of Christian blood, the miserable effect of warre, and dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
<pb facs="tcp:23836:2"/>
yet with full purpose, if that succeeded not, to recouer it by the sword; and therefore, as a necessary meanes conducing to those ends, the supply of Our Treasures was to bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for.</p>
            <p>This Parliament beginning in Ianuary last, proceeded some moneths with such harmonie betweene Us and Our people, as cannot bee paralleld by any former time: For as the House of Commons at the first, both in the manner of their supplie, and otherwise, shewed greater loue, and more respect then euer any House of Commons did to Us, or (as Wee thinke) to any King before Us: So We, vpon all their complaints, haue afforded them such memorable, and rare examples of Iustice, as many ages past cannot shew the like; wherein, that Wee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the weale of Our people before all particular respects, the things themselues doe suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently prooue, Our Iustice being extended, not onely to persons of ordinary ranke and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, but euen to the prime Officer of Our Kingdome. And although, after their first Recesse at Easter, Wee found that they misspent a great deale of time, rather vpon the inlarging of the limmites of their liberties, and diuers other curious, and vnprofitable things, then vpon the framing and proponing of good &amp; profitable Lawes: Yet We gaue them time and scope for their Parliamentary proceedings, and prolonged the Session to an vnusuall length, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing it vntill the eight and twentieth day of May, before Wee signified Our purpose for their Recesse; and then Wee declared, that We would make a Recession the fourth day of Iune next following, but onely for a time, and in such maner, as might bee without distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance to any their businesses in hand, expressing out of Our Grace (though Wee needed not) the causes of that Our purpose, which were the season of the yeere, vsually hot, and vnfit for great assemblies, Our Progresse approaching, the necessitie Wee had to make vse of Our Councell, attending in both houses, both to settle Our waightie affaires of State before Wee went, and to attend Us when Wee went Our Progresse, the disfurnishing of Our ordinary Courts of Iustice so many Termes together, the long absence of Iustices of Peace, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty Lieuetenants, whose presence was needfull for making and returning of musters, and for subordinate gouernement of the Countrey; and therefore Wee appointed to adiourne the Parliament on the fourth day of Iune, giuing that warning longer then vsuall, that they might set in order their businesses, and prepare their greeuances, which Wee promised both to heare and answere before that Recesse, for presenting whereof We appointed them a time. This message graciously intended by Us, was not so well entertained by some, who in a short time dispersed and spred their iealousies vnto others, and thereby occasioned discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in the House, for being adiourned without passing of billes; Yet made not their addresse to Us, as had beene meet, but desired a conference with the Lords; and at that conference, the nine and twentieth day of May, vnder colour of desiring to petition Us for some further time, to perfect and passe some speciall Bils, were imboldened, not onely to dispute, but to refell all the reasons that We had giuen for the adiournement, which being made knowen vnto Us, Wee againe signified Our pleasure to both Houses, that on the fourth day of Iune the Parliament should rise, but Wee would then giue Our Royall assent to such billes, as were or should bee ready and fit to bee then passed, continuing all other businesses in state they were, by a speciall Act to be framed for that purpose.</p>
            <p>The Lords with all duetie and respect, submitted to Our resolution, passed the Act, &amp; sent it with speciall recommendation to the house of Commons; but they neither read it, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with businesses, but forgetting that the time was Ours &amp; not theirs, continued their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, as they pretended, for being so soone dismissed, we (though it were strange to obserue such auersnes for Our resoluing vpon such waighty reasons, that wherin We needed not to be measured by any other rule, but Our owne Princely will) yet were contented to descend from our owne Right, to alter Our resolution, and to continue the Session for a fortnight more, wherein they might perfite such publique Billes, as were esteemed of most importance: for which purpose, We Our selfe came in person vnto the Higher house of Parliament, and made offer thereof vnto them, which being, in effect, as much as the Commons had formerly desired, was no sooner offered, but yeelding thankes to Us, the said Commons resolued the same day directly, contrary to their former desire, to refuse it, and to accept Our first Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an adiournement; but attending Us at Greenwich, presented no grieuances: this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancie, as We passed by with a gentle admonition; so for the matter of grieuances, aswell of England, as Ireland, We promised to take them into Our owne care, though not presented to Us, and really performed the same so far forth, as time, and the aduice of Our Councell of each Kingdome could enable Us, as is witnessed by Our seuerall Proclamations, published in both Realmes, as likewise in granting at the same time those three suites which were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned
<pb facs="tcp:23836:3"/>
vnto Us by the Arch-Bishop of Canterbury, at the request, and in the name of both the Houses: But in conclusion the house of Commons making it their choise, Wee made a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse by adiournement of the Parliament, the fourth day of Iune, though indeed Wee must doe them this right, that at the said Recesse, taking into their serious consideration the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent estate of Our children abroad, and the generall afflicted estate of the true Professors of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in forraine parts, they did with one vnanimous consent, in the name of themselues, and the whole body of the Kingdome, make a most dutifull and solemne protestation, that if Our pious Endeauours, by treatie to procure their peace and safetie, should not take that good effect which was desired, (in the treatie whereof, they humbly besought Us, not to suffer any long delay) then, vpon signification of Our pleasure in Parliament, they would be ready, to the vttermost of their powers, both with liues and fortunes to assist Us, so as that by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine helpe of Almightie God, We might be able to doe that by Our sword, which by peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able courses should not be effected.</p>
            <p>But during the time of this long Recesse, hauing to Our great charges mediated with the Emperour, by the meanes of Our Embassadour, the Lord <hi>Digbie,</hi> and hauing found those hopes to fayle, which we had to preuaile by treaty, We in confidence of the Assistance of Our people, thus freely promised and protested in Parliament, did instantly shorten the time of the Recesse, which We had before appointed to continue vntill the eighth day of February, and did reassemble Our Parliament, the twentieth day of Nouember last, and made knowen vnto them the true state and necessity of Our Childrens affayres, declaring Our resolution vnto them, of taking vpon vs the defence of Our Childrens patrimony, by way of Armes, since We could not compasse it by an amicable treaty; and therefore expected the fruit of that their declaration, whereby We were inuited vnto this course: wherein, howbeit We are well satisfied of the good inclination of the most part of Our House of Commons, testified by their ready assent to the speedy payment of a Subsidie, newly to be granted; yet vpon this occasion some particular members of that House tooke such inordinate liberty, not only to treat of Our high Prerogatiues, and of sundry things, that without Our speciall direction were no fit subiects to be treated of in Parliament; but also to speake with lesse respect of forraigne Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Our Allies, then were fit for any Subiect to doe of any anoynted King, though in enmity and hostility with Us. And when, vpon this occasion, Wee vsed some reprehension towards those miscarriages, requiring them not to proceed but in such things as were within the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of that House, according to the continuall custome of Our Predecessors, then by the meanes of some euill affected and discontented persons, such heat and distemper was raysed in the House, that albeit themselues had sued vnto Us for a Session, and for a generall pardon vnto both, which at their earnest suit We assented, yet after this fire kindled, they reiected both, and setting apart all businesses of consequence and waight (notwithstanding Our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition and earnest pressing them to goe on) they either sate as silent, or spent the time in disputing of Priuiledges, descanting vpon the words and syllables of Our Letters and mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, which for better cleering of trueth, and satisfaction of all men, We are about to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish in Print, so soone as possibly We can. And although in Our Answer to their petition, Wee gaue them full assurance that wee would bee as carefull of the preseruation of their Priuiledges, as of Our owne Royall Prerogatiue, and in Our explanation after sent vnto them by Our Letters, written to Our Secretary, We told them that Wee neuer meant to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie them any lawfull priuiledges that euer that House enioyed in Our predecessours times; and that whatsoeuer priuiledges or liberties they enioyed by any Law or Statute, should euer bee inuiolablie preserued by Us; and We hoped Our posterity would imitate Our footsteps therein; and whatsoeuer priuiledges they enioyed by long custome, and vncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and lawfull Presidents, We would likewise be as carefull to preserue them, and transmit the care thereof to Our posterity, confessing Our selues in iustice to bee bound to maintaine them in their Rights, and in grace, that We were rather minded to increase, then infringe any of them, if they should so deserue at Our hands, which might satisfie any reasonable man, that We were farre from violating their priuiledges. And although by Our Letters writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to their Speaker, We aduised them to proceed, and make this a Session, to the end, that Our good and louing Subiects might haue some taste, aswell of Our grace and goodnesse towards them, by Our free pardon and good Lawes to be passed, as they had both by the great and vnusuall examples of Iustice since this meeting, and the so many eases and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts giuen vnto them by Proclamation.</p>
            <p>And although We had giuen order for the Pardon to goe on, and that in a more gracious and liberall manner then hath passed in many yeeres before, and signified Our willingnesse,
<pb facs="tcp:23836:4"/>
that rather then time should bee misspent, they might lay aside the thought of the Subsidie, and goe on with an Act for continuance of Statutes, and the generall Pardon; but all this preuailed not to satisfie them, either for their pretended Priuiledges, or to perswade them to proceed with Bils for the good of themselues, and those that sent them. But as the Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Pardon were by them well desired at first; so were they as ill reiected at the last; and not withstanding the sinceritie of Our protestations, not to inuade their Priuiledges; yet by the perswasion of such as had beene the cause of all these distempers, they fall to carue for themselues, and pretending causelesly to be occasioned thereunto in an vnseasonable houre of the day, and a very thinne House, contrary to their owne Custome in all matters of waight, conclude, and enter a protestation for their liberties, in such ambiguous and generall words, as might serue for future times to inuade most of our inseparable Rights and Prerogatiues, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to Our Imperiall Crowne: whereof not onely in the times of other Our Progenitors, but in the blessed Raigne of Our late Predecessor, that renowned Queene <hi>ELIZABETH,</hi> We found Our Crowne actually possessed; an vsurpation that the Maiestie of a King can by no meanes endure. By all which may appeare, that howsoeuer in the generall proceedings of that House, there are many footsteppes of louing and well affected duetie to Us: yet some ill tempered spirits, haue sowed tares among the corne, and thereby frustrated the hope of that plentifull and good haruest, which might haue multiplyed the wealth and welfare of this whole land; &amp; by their cunning diuersions haue imposed vpon Us a necessitie of discontinuing this present Parliament, without putting vnto it the name or period of a Session. And therefore, whereas the said assembly of Parliament was by Our Commission adiourned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the eight day of February now next ensuing, We, minding not to continue the same any longer, and therefore not holding it fit to cause the Prelates, Noblemen, and States of this Our Realme, or the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses of the same Parliament to trauaile thereabout, haue thought fit to signifie this Our resolution, with the reasons thereof vnto all Our Subiects, inhabiting in all parts of this Realme, willing and requiring the said Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, Noblemen and States, and also the said Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to whom in this case it shall appertaine, that they forbeare to attend at the day and place prefixed by the said adiournement, and in so doing, they are and shall be hereby dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thereof against vs.</p>
            <p>And We doe hereby further declare, that the said Conuention of Parliament, neither is, nor after the ceasing and breaking thereof shall be, nor ought to be esteemed, adiudged, or taken to bee, or make any Session of Parliament. And albeit We are at this time enforced to breake off this Conuention of Parliament: yet Our will and desire is, that all Our subiects should take notice, for auoyding of all sinister suspitions and iealousies, that Our intent and full resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, to gouerne Our people in the same manner, as Our Progenitours and Predecessours, Kings and Queenes of this Realme of best gouernment, haue heretofore done; and that We shall be carefull, both in Our owne person, and by charging Our priuie Counsell, Our Iudges, and other Our Ministers in their seuerall places respectiuely, to distribute true Iustice &amp; right vnto all Our people; and that We shall bee as glad to lay hold of the first occasion in due and conuenient time, which We hope shall not be long, to call and assemble Our Parliament, with confidence of the true and hearty loue and affection of Our subiects, as either We, or any of Our Progenitors haue beene at any time heretofore.</p>
