            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

far, as to give me leave to deprecate
his ſevere cenſure for my laying down
that for a Foundation and Principle
demonſtrable, which to him ſeems to
need proof as much as any thing elſe I
ſhall ſay: For though in former times
the motion of the Earth hath been exploded as abſurd,
and in this laſt Age by Noble <hi>Verulam</hi> himſelf (whoſe
profound Philoſophy I no leſs admire, then I do at their
unworthy ſlighting of it, who proud of their own high
ſoaring Phantaſies, contemn experiment as below them;
and though they demoliſh the airy Caſtles of the Stagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
do it, but to make their own more ſpectable) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
as vain; yet it is by <hi>Galileo, Philolaus</hi> in his
<hi>De Syſtemate Mundi,</hi> and other accurate Obſervers and
Comparers of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Heaven, ſo plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
<hi>ad oculum,</hi> that it muſt now no longer paſs
for <hi>Opinio,</hi> but in the Language of the Schools under the
Notion of <hi>Scientia.</hi> Neither can I attribute the error of
the Ancients, and the Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> touching this point,
to any thing ſo much as this, That they were not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
verſ'd in Aſtronomy: For the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> and
reaſons whereon this piece of truth hangs, are for the

with the <hi>Theoriques</hi> of the Planets <hi>(abſit dicto invidia)</hi>
few or none, either know, mark, or can underſtand them,
as I might inſtance in Particulars: but that is no part of
my task. For that which follows, the moderate Reader
will finde it to be <hi>Sphaera plumbea,</hi> though dully penned,
yet of more weight then length: Had ſome <hi>Mercuries</hi>
had ſo much News to have told the world, three or four
quire of Paper would have been too ſtrait a girdle for
their Tympany; which diſeaſe is grown ſo much into
faſhion, that the ſmalneſs of my Book tells me, I muſt
expect no other welcome for it into the world but Tuſh,
and no other name but a Trifle.</p>

               <p>Weakneſs, in that all the Predictions (or at leaſt 99 in

is ſo cryed up in this Age, deduced from the <hi>Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maick</hi>
Aſpects, are ſo conſciouſly doubtful, ſo obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
delivered, and many of them ſo fallible, that it hath
notoriouſly proved the ſcandal of Aſtrology, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
the grave and ſober breaſts of the world with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
That Aſtrology is but a higher degree of <hi>Lieger
de main,</hi> and Aſtrologers but liberal Juglers. Nay ſo
pur-blinde it is (I mean the old Aſtrology) that in the
very matter of the weather it ſelf, it is fain to confeſs it
ſelf unable to do any more then give a probable conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of it; and not without good cauſe, ſince it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
far enough from doing that too.</p>

               <p>Shifts; in that, when it hath found the weather fall
out different or contrary to the promiſes or threats of
their Aſpects (which is no wonder, for many times
there is above a Moneths difference between the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
and true Aſpects; as for example, the ☌ ♄ ♀, which
our Almanacks this year all ſay happens about the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
end of <hi>May,</hi> really falls about the Tenth day of
<hi>April,</hi> and was no doubt the cauſe of that cold, rainy
weather that then happened; to ſay nothing of the

                  <g ref="char:Moonnew">●</g> ♄, that happened two or three days before, as they
ſhall finde who will take the pains to calculate this eaſier
way) and not onely the weather, but other accidents
too; it hath been forced to introduce a number of
whimſical Aſpects (as <hi>Semiſextiles, Tredeciles, Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
Biquintiles, Octiles, Vigintiles, Quincunces, Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreiles,
Deciles, Semiquadrates, Seſquiquadrates,</hi> and
the like) not ſo much to keep the other five old ones
company, as to furniſh it ready with a good and bad
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118142:6"/>
Aſpect, that ſo it may make either (as occaſion ſerves)
the Father of fair or foul weather.</p>

               <p>To the foregoing reaſons we ſhall adde another, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
but a weaker, That the truth of this doctrine of
Aſpects is wonderfully confirmed by obſervation, which
ſhould have been more particular and exact, had not
my profeſſion ſo ſtrictly engaged engaged me to a daily
and conſcientious attention upon it: For, having calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
the places of the Planets <hi>(Minerva aliquanto craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiore,</hi>
I confeſs for want of time to altar my Tables) in
relation to the ☉ as Center for ſome Moneths paſt; I
found the events all the way very audibly to anſwer my
expectations, even at ſuch time when they were dumb,
or gainſayed the Aſpects in the Almanacks. Let him
that liſts, make tryal to ſatisfie his minde by his own
obſervation; and he will (I dare confidently warrant
him) finde that this is truth which I tell him, beſides an
additional recompenſe for his pains.</p>

               <p>If any one ask how it ſhould come to paſs that <hi>Haly,
Guido,</hi> and many Aſtrologers both before and ſince,
never lighted on this way. His anſwer muſt be, That
they all received and were ſincerely perſwaded of the

ſought no further; whereas this is a Conſectary of the
new. And</p>

               <p>If he ask again how the Ancients thus erring both in
the kinde and time of the true Aſpects, could come to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118142:6"/>
know ſo well, not onely the nature of the Planets, that
ſome are benevolent, as ♃ and ♀; ſome malevolent, as
♄ and ♂; and ſome of a middle nature, as the other
three, but alſo of the Aſpects, that ſome are frowns, as
<g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> and ☍; ſome ſmiles, as ⚹ and <g ref="char:trine">△</g>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His anſwer is
ready for him, That it is moſt probable they came to
this knowledge by thoſe Aſpects which they had each
to other, when they were at or near ☌ or ☍ of the ☉, as
alſo by their ☌ or ☍ to the ☉ himſelf; which Aſpects (as
I told you) differ, ſome very little, and ſome nothing at
all in time from the true Aſpects. As for example, it
might ſo fortune that ♄ and ♀ might be in ☌, near about
the time (that is, within a day or two) of ♄ his conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
with the ☉, and at that conjunction they might
obſerve cold, miſſing, rainy weather to happen. Hence
they gathered, that ☌ ♄ ♀ <hi>(conſideratis conſiderandis)</hi>
was the cauſe of a cold miſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing rain. And ſo in others,
not that I think this uncertain guide (blinde on one eye,
and pur-blinde on the other) could lead them into a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and infallible knowledge of their influence; for I
am perſwaded, that in ſome matters they will be found
very wide: And what thoſe matters are, this that I here
propoſe is the moſt likely way to diſcover.</p>

               <p>This that I ſpeak touching the places and Aſpects of
the Planets to be altered, I would have to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood

That the greateſt part of that batch of eſſential

Reception, Conformity of Hain and Quarter,
combuſtion, in centro ☉, and the like; together with part
of Fortune, life and death, and the diviſions ſeverally
of the Houſes and Signs, deſerve no other place but to
be ranked among thoſe Shifts which I ſpake of before,
being invented for the ſame end, as is probable enough.</p>

            <div n="21" type="section">
               <head>Sect. 22.</head>
               <p>And ſince I have been hitherto ſo to bold to correct
that Aſtrology which hath been received by all Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians
till now: I ſhall venture a little further in the
proſecution of it, ſeeing there are other things fit to be
conſidered in Aſtrology which are not, becauſe men
generally hold Authority to be reaſon.</p>

            <div n="22" type="section">
               <head>Sect. 23.</head>
               <p>Firſt then let the Aſpects of thoſe Planets whoſe Orbs
are immediately contignate, be ranked in a degree of
more powerful, becauſe <hi>Vis unitior fortius agit:</hi> ſuch
are the Aſpects of ♄ and ♃, ♃ and ♂, ♂ and <g ref="char:Moonround">❍</g>, ♂ and
☽, when ſhe is oppoſite to the ☉, <g ref="char:Moonnew">●</g> and ♀, ♀ and the ☽,
when ſhe is about the change; and ♀ and ☿. And as the
Orbs of the configurated Planets are farther aſunder or
nearer together, ſo let their Aſpects be accounted leſs or
more forcible.</p>

            <div n="23" type="section">
               <head>Sect. 24.</head>
               <p>Secondly, Let the Aſpects of the ☽ with the other
Planets be little reckoned upon (unleſs in the caſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovenamed)
ſince they move about divers centers, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118142:7"/>
their Aſpects therefore are properly not Aſpects, but
ſeeming ſo: The moſt conſiderable thing in the motion
of the ☽ is her age, or relation to the ☉.</p>

            <div n="24" type="section">
               <head>Sect. 25.</head>
               <p>Thirdly, Let no Aſtrologer henceforward diſparage
the fortune of his Native, becauſe his Almuten is ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary
or retrograde, nor flatter it any thing the more
becauſe he is direct; ſeeing theſe paſſions are not real,
but (as they are fitly called) <hi>Phaenomena:</hi> But let him
rather judge by the Planets <hi>Apogaeoſis, Perigaeoſis, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pergaeoſis,</hi>
and <hi>Hypogaeoſis</hi> his culmination, his riſing and
ſetting, his Northern or Southern Declination and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
things not hitherto much regarded.</p>

               <head>Sect. 26.</head>
               <p>Fourthly, (but herein I give but my judgement) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
our now-Aſtrology begins the year at the ☉ his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into ♈ on this ſide of the <hi>Equator,</hi> and erects its
figure of Revolution for that time; it ſeems more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous
to begin it in <hi>December,</hi> when the ☉ enters ♍;
and for this reaſon, becauſe at that point of time the
☉ hath juſt finiſhed his furtheſt Southern progreſs, and
begins to come towards us again, from that time (to
uſe the common Argument) inſtilling life by degrees in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Plants of the Earth by his approach; which,
though it be moſt palpable in <hi>March,</hi> when he enters ♈,
yet hath it a being and meaſure while he is in ♍, and
though ♈ be the birth of vegetables, yet is ♍ their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="26" type="section">
               <head>Sect. 27.</head>
               <p>Fifthly, for the very ſame reaſon whereas Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
accommodate always their Scheme to the time of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118142:8"/>
excluſion, and by that judge of the future lot of the
Native; it would better agree with reaſon (me thinks)
to apply it to the time of the conception (if it may be
known) becauſe that is moſt properly the firſt inſtant of
being: for ſuch is in many things our ſtupidity, that we
think a thing is not, becauſe we cannot ſee it be. And</p>
            </div>
            <div n="27" type="section">
               <head>Sect. 28.</head>
               <p>Laſtly, for the more full aſſurance and attaining to
perfection in Judgement of the weather, I could wiſh
that a courſe might be contrived (if it were poſſible) for
obſerving the weather in ſome place under or near the
<hi>Equator,</hi> and in the ſame <hi>Longitude</hi> with <hi>London,</hi> where
there are the ſame noons, nights, mornings and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
(ſuch as are <hi>Axum, Mina</hi> or <hi>Biamba</hi> in <hi>Guinea,</hi> in
5 or 6 degrees of North Latitude) and that for half a
year or more (places near the <hi>Equator</hi> I chuſe, becauſe <hi>ob
propinquitatem aſtrorum vim citius purius &amp; evidentius
ſentiunt)</hi> while the like obſervations are made at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
at the ſame time and for by the ſame ſpace; that by
the collation of theſe Obſervations (together with the
Principles here delivered) that dark Riddle of Nature
may be ſolved. And</p>

            <div n="28" type="section">
               <head>Sect. 29.</head>
               <p>Here, by being ſo near, I ſhall take occaſion to preſume
little farther, and tell ſome Aſtrologers who account it
their glory to have their hearers tremble at their Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
that they betray both their own credit, and (as
in them lies) the truth of Gods Word, by telling the
world that this Eclipſe paſt in <hi>March,</hi> and that other to
come in 1654. are certain Signs of the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
For (though it be true that Eclipſes of the ☉
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118142:8"/>
(as we call them) are more dreadful and effectual to us,
then thoſe of the ☽; for this reaſon, becauſe the one
ſort are a privation of original Light, the of other a deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative
onely, yet) ſeeing that every year there happen
ſometimes two, ſometimes three, ſometimes more, but
never fewer Eclipſes, viſible in one Horizon or other,
though our own be no witneſs of them; the World by
their Logick would have been by this time diſſolved a
hundred times over and over. And by this means too
we can expect no leſs, then that credulous and cavilling
heads, when they ſhall have ſurvived that other Eclipſe
as well as this, and ſhall ſee the Univerſe <hi>in ſtatu quo,</hi>
notwithſtanding theſe outragious fantaſies had turned
all into aſhes, will be apt enough to think, <hi>That ſacred
Prophecies are us empty Terrors,</hi> as thoſe bold Sooth-ſaying;
and, <hi>That dooms-day is but a dream.</hi> A help
which in theſe days we need leaſt, ſince too many al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
have leap'd into Hell without this ſtaff. That the
end ſhall be, is an Article of the Catholique Faith; but
when it ſhall be (ſince the <hi>Ephemerides</hi> of Heaven ſpeaks
nothing of it; and not onely the Stars of the <hi>Caelum
Empiraeum</hi> know nothing of it, but the Son of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
himſelf confeſſes as much for them and himſelf
too) is more then curioſity to ask, more then madneſs
to determine, and more then folly to believe.</p>

               <p>Aſtrologers in general take it upon truſt from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,
that Eclipſes operate not preſently, but after a
time, and content themſelves with their Authority:
But the thing is ſo adverſe to reaſon, that it might juſtly
be ſuſpected to have been brought into Aſtrology upon
the ſame ſcore, and for the ſame reaſon that thoſe other
