            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It may ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore please you to call to remembraunce, how about Christmas last, maister Iames Thomas a studious gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, your kinseman and my good friend, comming to your house to visit you, wee happened to fall in talke of some bookes wherin I had done mine endeuour by tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slating to pleasure you: Among which I chiefly approued that <note n="(a)" place="marg1">
                  <hi>Antimachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auell.</hi>
               </note> wherin I last laboured, being by the Author ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of very learnedly handled, &amp; hauing a notable Subiette, to wit,<note n="(b)" place="marg1">
                  <hi>Lipsius Politickes.</hi>
               </note> matter of pollicie and gouernmente in peace and warre. Wherevpon the gentleman recommended vnto me an other excellent booke of that argument, vpon which he wished me to bestowe some paines for your pleasure, whom hee perceaued to bee greatly delighted with such exercises. I promised him so to doe. But at his returne to London soone after, he aduertised me that the
<pb facs="tcp:21394:3"/>
same booke was englished, which in deed is very wel and sufficiently perfourmed by a learned gentleman, with no small labour to him, and some ease to me. Afterwardes seing the method of this writer so much pleased mee, (as I think it can displease no man that taketh pleasure in reading) I called to minde this treatise of CONSTAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIE, which came to my hands about ten yeares past, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a student in Oxford. And considering of it with better aduisement then euer I did before, it seemed vnto me a work not vnworthy your good consideration. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore albeit I know wel your iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be very sufficient in vnderstanding latine writers far more profounde then this: yet aswell to make the same somwhat more familiar &amp; plaine vnto you, as also that you may impart it to such of your frends as pleaseth you, and finally to shew my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy disposition in gratifying you to my power, I haue redu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced it into english, I feare me, with more hast then good speede, not hauing spent full fiue weekes there abouts, as you very well know. Wherein I trauelled with the more paines for bringing foorth this vntimely birth, to the end it might receaue his perfecte consummation against this day of your birth, whereunto I had respecte when I firste took the work in hand. And thus I earnestly recommend the preseruation of it to your fauorable protection, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you to accepte in good part my little labour, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from no little good will. And so I wish to your selfe &amp; to my good lady your spouse all happines, beseeching God longe to preserue you both. From my chamber in your castle of Saint Donatts. The xiij of Iune. 1594.</p>

            <head>The Epistle to the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter I had translated this treatise (frendly reader) and presented it to him for whose priuate vse I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it, being moued thereunto vpon occasion in the former epistle declared: it seemed not amisse to the patron to haue the same published for the benefit of many. Whose iudgement I could not but very wel approue in respect of the matter, being both comfortable and pleasant to be red, and withall very orderly laid down, and handled after an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accustomed yet most familiar) manner.</p>
            <p>Vnderstand, that I haue for breuities sake purposely omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the epistles before the booke, which are three: (being loath to pesterre thee with a packet of letters at the first) Onely I do here alleadge out of them a few things written by my Author in his owne defence. And first whereas some men pretend he hath not handled this argument deuoutly enough in that hee applieth not places of holy scripture to his purpose:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>A defence for the Author.</hi>
               </note> As he accep<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth well of their admonition, so his answere is that seeing he professeth himselfe herein no diuine, but a philosopher, (yet a Christian philosopher) they ought to beare with him. Hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth the only direct path-way to saluation to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised in those sacred bookes: but that good letters withal, and the writings of philosophers are both an ease and help for vs to attain vnto the vnderstanding of them, and do further vs in the way of vertue and godlines, howsoeuer som new Domiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans maintaine the contrary, seeking to abolish all good arts &amp; knowledge in humanity. That he writeth so highly in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of RIGHT REASON, although som times with the words of the Au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cients: yet he acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pteth no reason pure or right except it be directed by God &amp; illuminated by faith. If in writing of destiny &amp; other lik profou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d matters his tongue (through an ardente and earnest intente of a good meaning mind) hapned any wher to trip or his pen to slide; Be not thou
<pb facs="tcp:21394:4"/>
too rigorus towards him for it, he yealdeth to amend whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer shalbe proued amisse. He professeth himselfe of the nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those that haue godlinesse rather in hearte, then in their mouth; And liketh not the time that is fruitefull of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, and fruitelesse impietie. Finally he is none of those subtle sophisticall ianglers, that place philosohie in the quirks and quiddities of crabbed questions. But he directeth his stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to the forming of good manners, and moderating of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, (especially feare, and sorrow in aduersitie) whereby hee may at length be safely harbored in the hauen of a contented mind. A notable testimonie whereof hee hath left vs in these two bookes, to the singular comforte of all that list to reade them.</p>
            <p>In englishing whereof I haue endeuored the best I could to performe the duetie of an interpreter, keeping alwaies the sense and meaning of my author;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>A reason of the translators doings herein.</hi>
               </note> yea the very words precisely in al definitions, distributions, distinctions &amp; such like princi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pal heads of matter, decyphering them in a greater letter; As the places quoted out of other writers, in a lesser. The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall notes appeare to be of two sortes; Some answering to the places in the text directly against them, seruing for quota<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions or expositions: (with these letters a. b. c. &amp;c) Others containing a briefe summe of the whole matter of each chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by a perpetuall continuation, as if all of them were but one intire note. And euen so the contents befere euery chapter haue not alwaies in them a perfect and full sense, but depende many times vpon the contents nexte following. In all these I swerue not from my printed copie, sauing that I haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a few marginall notes for expositions sake where neede required. Lastly I haue with some more care and diligence of mine owne, reduced the summe of both bookes into a large and plaine table containing the argument of the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference vnder one viewe, the better to helpe thy memorie, if it please thee to consider of the matter with more mature deliberation.</p>
            <p>If thou reape any pleasure or profit by this discourse, giue
<pb facs="tcp:21394:4"/>
thanks (next vnto God) to my Author; then to the patron, for whom onely and by whome the same was both englished and published. For mine owne part I desire no more but curteous acceptation of my trauaill, I hope I deserue no lesse. A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle good-will and a few good wordes for many daies work, is no vnreasonable rewarde: And he that grudgeth to giue such bare wages, as I would be loth to be his man, so if him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe were bound to serue a bad master seuen yeeres after the same rate, I wot well he would mislike his penny-worths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that prentiship were expired, and euer after looke on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens labours with a more fauorable eie. But for thee (curteous reader) at whose hands I doubt not to receaue bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter entertainement, I beg hartely of him which giueth euery good gift, that by reading &amp; meditating vpon this little trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tise, it will please him to worke in thy mind such a firme im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of CONSTANCIE, as neither the violent flouds of common calamities may be able to wash away, nor the firie flame of priuate afflictions to consume the same: But that as a plant set in good ground, watred with the fruitfull streames flowing in <note n="(a)" place="marg1">I meane the Greeke and latin phrases.</note> goulden and siluer cesterns from the sweete fountaine of <hi>Lipsius,</hi> and conueighed to thee through these clayie conduite-pipes of my tempering, thou maist take deepe roote, and stand immoueable against all the blastes of fortune, neither terrified with feare of future mishappe, nor dismaied for any perilles present or past. Which victory though it seeme full of difficulty, yet if thou take vnto thee the armour and wepons here offered, hauing an indifferent courage of thine owne, thou shalt assuredly remaine a conquerour of those selfe affections, which do tirannize ouer the greatest tyrants, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their minds in more seruile subiection, then they do the bodies of their vilest captiues. Farewell. From the castle of Saint Donatts the xxiiii day of August. 1594.</p>

So you that are wounded with this dart of affections, doe not shake it out, but in traueilling carie it with you to an other place.

               <p>It is the mind that is wounded,<note place="margin">For it is a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease of the mind.</note> and all this external im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becilitie, dispaire &amp; languishing, springeth from this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that the mind is thus postrated and cast downe.

Arme thy selfe against them, and take this fatal weapon in thy hand, which will not only pricke, but panch all these sorrowes: not lighten thee, but wholly vnlode thee of them. As a nettle if you touch it softlie, stingeth; but looseth his force if you handle it roughlie: So this griefe groweth greater by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing soft mollifying plaisters, but is soone cured with sharp corrasiues. Nowe there is nothing more forcible than NECESSITIE,<note place="margin">The same is a most strong armour of proof against sorrow.</note> which vvith one assault ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth and putteth to flight all these vveake troupes. What meanest thou Sorrowe? It is no boote to vse thee, when a thing of necessitie must, or reason ought to come to passe. VVhat wilt thou querulous complaint doe? Thou maist shake this celestiall yoake, but not shake it of.

You commend gardens, but so as you seeme only to admire vain and outward things therin, neglecting the true &amp; law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful delights therof. You poare only vpon collours, and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and are greedy of strange Flowers brought from all partes of the world. And to what end is all this? Except it be that I might account thee one of that sect which is risen vp in our dayes, of curious &amp; idle persons,<note place="margin">The new sect of Garden-masters, scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> who haue made a thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat was in it self good and without al offence, to be the instrument of two foule vices, <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Slouthfulnes.</hi> For euen to this end haue they their gardens: they do vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gloriously hunt after strange hearbs &amp; flowers, which hauing gotten, they preserue &amp; cherish more carefully tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth her child: these be the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whose letters fly abroad

into <hi>Thracia, Greece,</hi> and <hi>India</hi> only for a little root or seede These men will bee more grieued for the losse of a newe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found flower, than of an olde friend. Would not any man laugh at that <note n="(a)" place="marg1">
                     <hi>Hortensius vvho (it is said) vvare mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning apparell for the losse of a Lamprey.</hi>
                  </note>Romane which mourned in blacke for the death of a fish that he had. So do these men for a plant.</p>
               <p>Now if any of these whome ye see come hether to my Dame <hi>Flora</hi> for flowers, happen to get any new or strange one, how doth he boast of it? His companions doe grudge and enuie at him, yea some of them return home with a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uier heart, than euer did <hi>Sylla</hi> or <hi>Marcellus</hi> when they were put backe in their suit for the Pretorship. What should I cal this but a kind of merrie madnesse? not vnlike the striuing of children about their little puppets and babbies.</p>
               <p>Yet consider moreouer what great paines they take in these gardens. They sit, walk about the allies, stretch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues like sluggards, and sleepe; So as they make that place not onely a nurserie of idlenesse, but a verie sepulcher of their slothfulnes. A prophane generation of men! whome I may rightlie banish from the ceremonies and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of true gardens, which I know were ordained for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest recreation, not for vanitie: for solace, not for slouth. What? shall I be so light-headed as to be lifted vp or pressed downe in mind for the getting or loosing of some rare and straunge hear be? Nay rather I will esteeme al things accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their worth,<note place="margin">The true vse of Gardens.</note> and setting aside the inticement of rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and noueltie, I knowe they are but hearbes or flowers; that is, things fading and of smal continuance. Of which the Poet speaketh verie fitly, <hi>that Zephirus with his blastes bringeth vp some,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Which consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth not in the price and estimation of flowers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <hi>and withereth others.</hi> Therefore I doe not contemne the beautie and elegancie of them; (as you may see for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample here before your eies:) But I dissent from the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of these great Garden-masters, in that I get them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much trauell, keepe them without care, and lose them
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:21394:41"/>

As a whip, because it is our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hande that dooth often scourge vs when wee doo amisse: but it is a butcherly fist that striketh seldome, and then payeth home for all at once. As fire or water are vsed to purge filth:<note place="margin">Which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection doth either blot out, and wipe away our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.</note> So is this Purgatorie of persecutions to our sinnes. This whip <hi>(Lipsus</hi>) is now worthilie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon vs. We Flemings haue of a long time falne in the lapse, and beeing corrupted with delights and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of wealth, we haue wandered in the slipperie pathes of viciousnesse: But that great God dooth admonish &amp; gentlie reclaime vs, giuing vs a fewe stripes, that beeing warned thereby, we may come againe to our selues, yea rather to him. He hath taken from vs our goodes, which we abused to luxuriousnesse. Our liberty, which wee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused licentiouslie. And so with this gentle correction of calamities, he dooth (as it were) purge and washe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie our wickednesse. A right gentle correction it is. For alasse, what a slender satisfaction may we call it? It is said that when the Persians woulde punish any Noble man, they tooke from him his garments and hood, and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those vppe, did beate them in stead of the man: euen so dooth this our father, who in all his chastisementes toucheth not vs, but our bodies, our fieldes, our wealth, and all externall things.</p>
               <p>Likewise Chasticement serueth as a bridle, which hee
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:21394:49"/>
rayneth fitlie, when he seeth vs running to wickednes. As Physitians do sometimes vpon good aduise let blood, not that the partie is sicke, but to preuent sicknes:<note place="margin">Or else doth terrifie &amp; with draw vs from committing them.</note> So God by these afflictions taketh away something from vs, which els would foster and nourish vices in vs. For he knoweth the nature of all men, which created them all. He iudgeth not of diseases by the vaines, or collour: But by the very heart and inwardes.<note place="margin">For it is vsed as a preuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> Doth he see the Tuscane wits to bee sharpe and waspish? He keepeth them vnder with a prince. Doeth he see the Switzers to be of disposition peaceable &amp; quiet?<note place="margin">By him who knoweth all inward diseases yea the least dispositions in vs.</note> He giueth them libertie. The Venetians to bee of a meane betweene both? He permitteth to them a mixt or meane kind of gouernment. All which peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture he wil change in time, if those people alter their dispositions. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding we murmure, saying, Why are we longer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with warre, than others? Or why are wee helde in more cruell bondage? O foole, and sicke at the very heart! art thou wiser than God? Tell me,<note place="margin">Therfore we do in vaine &amp; vnaduisedlie search the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creates of his medicines.</note> why doeth the Physitian minister to one patient more Wormewood or Lingwort, than to another? Forsooth because the disease or disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the party so requireth. Euen so think thou of thy self. He seeth this people haplie to be somewhat stubborne and therefore that they must be kept vnder with corrections: an other nation more meeke that may be brought vnder obedience onely with shaking of the rod.<note place="margin">For he appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding to the diuersitie of natures.</note> But it may bee that vnto thee it seemeth otherwise.

In euery age Citties and tovvnes are builded, and if burnings or other destructions happened not, our World, nor scarce another would containe them. And so in conceipt thou maiest passe through the nature of all things.<note place="margin">Therfore the sithe of commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> calamities is needfull, to mowe and cut downe.</note> Therefore, Is it any maruell; if that olde father of the familie thrust in his sickle into this ranke fielde, and cut off some superfluous thousandes with pestilence or warre?

               <p>And concerning the bewtie or ornament of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, my coniecture is two fold.

The summer is most pleasant, yet the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:21394:52"/>
winter dooth make it more louely with her ycie marble and white snow. Which things if you take away, in truth you depriue vs of the inward delight and feeling both of sunne and Summer. In this our Earth, one vniform fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion pleaseth me not, but I take pleasure to behold the Champion countrey and mountaines, vallies and rocks, Fieldes tilled and Sea sands, meadowes and woods. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie and lothsomnesse is euer a companion of vnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity or likenesse. And vppon this stage of my life, whye should one fashion of attire and gesture content me? No, it shal not. But (in my minde) let there be times of great quietnesse, and therein some naughtinesse; which soone after tumults of warres and the rage of cruel tyrants may take away. Who would wish this world to be like a dead Sea, without wind or waues?</p>
               <p>But I perceiue moreouer another kinde of ornament, of more account and inward profit.<note place="margin">And in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending or polishing of things, and of our minds.</note> Histories doo teach me, that al thinges become better and quietter, after the stormes of aduersities.

The Romanes in times past, imposed a greeuous yoke vppon the necke of the whole world, but yet a yoke that prooued whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some in the ende; wherby Barbarisme was expelled from our mindes, as the sunne driueth away darkenesse from our eies. What had the Frenchmen, we our selues, and the Germanes beene at this day, if the light of that migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Empire had not shined vpon vs? Fierce, vnciuill, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in slaughters betwixt our selues and others, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of God and men. Euen so (I gesse) it will come to passe with the new world which the Spaniardes haue wasted with a profitable seueritie,<note place="margin">A verie fit simi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>litude.</note> and themselues will shortly replenish againe with people, and inhabit it. And as they which haue great nurseries for plants, do remoue some, set others, and cut off other some, ordering them
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:21394:53"/>
with skill for their owne good and benefit: Euen so doth God in this wide fielde of the world. For he is a most skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful husband man, and one while he breaketh off som wast braunches of families: An other while he croppeth and cutteth away a fewe leaues of particular men. This hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the stock of the tree, albeit those branches perish, &amp; those leaues are blowne away with the winde. Againe he seeth this nation very bare and barren of vertues: hee ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth it out. Another rough and vnfruitfull: hee remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it. Yea and som he confoundeth among themselues &amp; by grafting maketh (as it were) a medley of them. You Italians waxen feeble and effeminate in the declining of your Empire, why do ye hold the best cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try of the world? Geue place. Let the sterne and sturdy Lumbards manure with more happines this soile. You wicked &amp; wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ton Gre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cians, perish ye vtterly: And let those cruel Scithians be set<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led &amp; wax mild in your cuntry.

All which matters (Lipsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us) and many more are manifest out of histories and by the euentes of things, to any diligent reader.</p>
               <p>Therfore let vs lift vp our selues, and whatsoeuer dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage we sustaine priuately, let vs know that it doth good in some part of the whole world. The rooting out of one nation or kingdom, is the raising vppe of an other: The decay of one tower, the building of an other: And no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thinge properly dyeth or perisheth heere, but altereth. Are we Flemings alone in accompte and estimation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God? Alone continually happie, and fortunes white sonnes? O fooles! That greate gran-dam hath many moe children, whom we must bee contented that shee cherish and lull in her lappe one after another, because she either can not, or will not dally with them all at once.

let the glittering light illuminate the Spaniards and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest westerne partes. Seneca (after his manner) sayth fitly and profoundly to this purpose. <hi>A wise man should not take in ill parte whatsoeuer happeneth vnto him: But let him know that those selfe things which seeme to annoy him, do belong to the preseruation of the whole world, and are of the nomber of those things that do consummate the course &amp; office of the whole.</hi>

               <p>THis plaine &amp; broad way (Lipsius) is onely safe here: All others be deceaueable and slippery. In diuine and heauenly matters,<note place="margin">Simplissitie &amp; modestie are acceptable to God.</note> it is the sharpest sight to see nought; and the only knowledge to know nothing. Yet because this cloud hath of old time, and nowe doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe mens wittes, I will wind thee out of it shortly, if I can. And will wash away that that sticketh by thee, with this riuer here at hand. O thou celestiall and eternall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite (there with he cast his eies on high) pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue me if in these profound misteries I vtter any thing impure or vngodly, yet with a godly intent.

The moments of times are of great weight, and the most wholesom me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine is often turned to the destruction of the diseased, not being applyed in due season. God cut off Caligula in the prime of his tyrannie. He suffered Nero to run on far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; And Tiberius farthest of all. And doubte thou not but it was for the good of those that then murmured at it. Our euill and disordered manners haue neede of a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall scourge, but we woulde haue it taken from vs at the firste, and caste into the fier.

               <p>Another there is in respecte of God vnto whome it seemeth peculiar. <hi>To proceed slowly in reuenge of himselfe, and to quit that slacknesse with the grieuousnes of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Well spake Sinesius,<note place="margin">Secondly it procedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an instincte of his nature, (If I may, so speake.)</note>

Eternall.</note> as pouertie banishment, griefes, diseases, death. And it commeth to passe oftentimes that all these, by the iust iudgement of God, doo fal vppon the wicked: But certeinly the twoe former kinds doo alwaies followe them.<note place="margin">Some of these are alwaies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted vpon the wicked.</note> And to speake of INTERNALL punishments, what man was there at any time so giuen ouer to worke wickednesse, but that he felt in his minde sharpe scourges,<note place="margin">Especially the internal, which are corrasiues to the mynd,</note> and (as it were) heauy strokes eyther in committing mischieuous deeds, or else after the facts committed?

In so much that the store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house of heauen (as I may say with the Satiricke) woulde be without thunder bolts, if they were hurled continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally vpon all that do offend.

If thou looke vpon these things with indifferent &amp; sound eies: alas what trifles are they? if thou poise them according to their weight, how light be they? This war, or else the tirannie of gouernors through excessiue tributes will impouerish thee. What then? Thou shalt be a poore man. Did not nature so mak thee, and so shall take thee hence? But if the odious and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous name of tiranny offend thee, change thy habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so shalt thou free thy selfe.

But wee poore wretches doe turne our selues to these vaine and external matters, not fearing the thinges themselues but the circumstances and adiuncts of them. Beholde if thou saile on the sea, and it beginne to swell mightely, thy courage quaileth, and thou tremblest with feare, As though if the shippe were cast away, thou shouldest swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low vp the whole sea, whereas one quart or two thereof will suffice to drowne thee. If an earth-quake bee soden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raysed, what crying out and quaking is there? Thou imaginest that the whole towne, or at leaste a hovse will fall vppon thee: And dooest not consider that the drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping downe of one little stone is enough to knocke out thy braines. Euen so is it in these greate common cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, in the which the noise and vaine imagination of thinges doth terryfie vs. See, this troupe of soldiors! See, these shining swordes! why? what can these soldiors, or these swordes doe? They will kill me. What is kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? A bare and meere death onely.

Euen so standeth the case in these matters that seeme so terrible, which if thou behold without vaile or visard, thou wilt confesse that all thy feare was but childish. As hailstones though they beat vppon houses with a great noise, yet themselues doo leape away and are dissolued: So these thinges if they happen to light vppon a constant setled mind, doo not cast downe it, but vanish and come to naught themselues.</p>
