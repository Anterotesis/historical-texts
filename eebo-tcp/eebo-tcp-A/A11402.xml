            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

After, breathing a while, he enters a discourse of the Aire, shewing how it is deuided, what the temperature of each region is, with the causes of the same: and how
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:11261:6"/>
the mists, the blasts, the clouds, the deaw, the yee and other waterie meteors are ingendred: and consequently intreateth of the falling starres, and comets, with the rest of the fiery impressions which are often seene in the two extreme regions of the aire. Hereunto he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyneth a philosophicall narration of the thunder and lightning, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in briefe their strange yet certaine effects; not omitting, for the more absolute complement of his discourse, to assigne probable reasons of the raine-bow, the circles about the Sunne and Moone, and the many Sunnes and Moones, which affright the ignorant with their appearance. But albeit he shewes himself a Philosopher in producing these naturall reasons, yet he would haue euery man to shew himselfe a Christian, in not wholy resting satisfied with these second causes; but euer so to acknowledge the wisedome of the Almighty, that he rather admire the creator, then adore the creature: adding thereunto the religious vse, which Christians should make of these impressions and prodigious signes. And that he may clip the wings of mans pride, which is wont to soare beyond it selfe in self-conceits, he demonstrates how it is impossible for the most cunning naturalist, to render sound reasons of all accidents. Then leauing the aire, he ouerthrowes their opinion which hold but three elements, and shewes the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that elementarie and our compounded fire; adioyning therunto a briefe treatise of the matter, the motion and number of the celestial spheares. And answering those which are of opinion, that there are no waters aboue the firmament, he assumes a fit occasion to mention the generall floud; with an elegant description whereof he ends this second dayes worke. All which excellent points he adornes with such pleasant illustrations, that
