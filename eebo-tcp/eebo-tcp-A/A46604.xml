            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Pardon me, Sir, that I forgot to inſert the name of</hi> Wi: Williams, <hi>who you may remember Spew'd Sir</hi> Robert Peyton <hi>out of the Houſe of Commons, for correſponding with the late King when Duke of</hi> York. <hi>And who told King</hi> Charles II. <hi>That the</hi> Commons were not given to Change; <hi>but it is now evident that ſome of their</hi> Quondam Speakers <hi>are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On <hi>Tueſday</hi> the Houſe ordered that their abſent Members, as they come to the Houſe, do come up to the Table, and ſign the Aſſociation; or, in their Places, declare their Refuſal ſo to do: and</p>
            <p>On <hi>Thurſday</hi> it was ordered that the Aſſociation, and the Subſcriptions thereunto, be entred upon the Journal of the Houſe; and Reſolved that it be preſented to His Majeſty, by the Speaker, and <hi>the whole Houſe,</hi> before the end of the Seſſion.</p>
            <p>It was alſo, the ſame day, ordered that ſuch Members who have not already, ſhall by <hi>Monday</hi> Fortnight Sign the Aſſociation, or declare their Refuſal; and I do on as good Ground, as <hi>Gadbury</hi> foretold the Plot, predict that the Body of Refuſers in this Honourable Houſe will ſcarce, at the ſumming up, amount to the number of one hundred.</p>
            <p>Permit me now (Dear Sir) to Recreate my ſelf a little in remarking on what I have laid before you.</p>
            <p>

As the Doubting Lords are but few; ſo of the twenty ſix Members of your Large and Rich County of <hi>Devon,</hi> you find but three Diſſenters: and but one (I include not their Biſhop) of the eighteen in the Spacious County of <hi>Kent.</hi> No more than one out of twelve in another of the largeſt Counties of <hi>England,</hi> I mean <hi>Norfolk.</hi> To augment their Number, <hi>Eſſex</hi> (another of our greateſt Counties) furniſhes one out of eight. <hi>Cheſhire</hi> one out of their four. <hi>Derbyſhire</hi> one out of four alſo; and <hi>Herefordſhire ſuch another one</hi> out of eight. The Diminutive, but Opulent, County of <hi>Huntington,</hi> has lent them another out of four: and that Honeſt County of <hi>Surrey</hi> one out of fourteen, but I aſſure you it is a very <hi>Sorry One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You find not one of the ſixteen Members for the <hi>Cinque</hi> Ports in this <hi>Non-Aſſociation;</hi> and the twelve Counties of <hi>Wales</hi> have of their twenty four Members but eight Refuſers, of whom one is now His Majeſties Counſel, and was of King <hi>James</hi>'s Counſel againſt the Biſhops. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they have a <hi>Recuſant Biſhop</hi> to head them, of King <hi>James</hi>'s own making; but unleſs I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remember he was not one of the ſeven golden Candleſticks.</p>
            <p>You want (Sir) in the above-written Liſt eleven of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Counties, which are theſe,</p>

            </list>
            <p>Of which Number, being 67, I tell you for their Honour, there is not one Recuſant.</p>
            <p>I farther obſerve to you, that in the ſeven <hi>old Aſſociated Counties, viz. Eſſex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridge, Huntington, Bedford</hi> and <hi>Hertford,</hi> there are but 3 Recuſants; and you will find above 4 times that Number of Aſſociating Lords there. In <hi>London</hi> and the contiguous Counties, <hi>viz. Middleſex, Bucks, Berks, Wiltſhire, Hantſhire, Surrey, Suſſex, Kent, Lincoln,</hi> and <hi>Northampton,</hi> which make another 11 Counties, and ſend no leſs than 172 Members; you will find, upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of the foregoing Liſt, that there had been but 19 Refuſers, had not Mr. <hi>Done</hi> and Mr. <hi>Parſons</hi> added two to their Number.</p>
            <p>Now to detain you no longer in diſcourſing of the Houſe of Commons; let this aſſure you that the City of <hi>London</hi> had like to have been as unanimous as the firſt 11 Counties. A Common Council was this laſt Week ſummoned, where the foregoing Aſſociation being propoſed it was agreed unto and ſigned by every Member preſent (that whole Body conſiſting of 234), one only excepted; whoſe name may not be forgot, it is <hi>Lawrence Cole,</hi> a Man of little Note before he was one of honeſt Mr. <hi>Bateman</hi>'s Jury.</p>
            <p>I hope Sir, this pleaſant Scheme of the Kingdom, and its Affairs, will in ſome meaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you from the Panick fear into which you ſay <hi>Gadbury</hi> and <hi>Partridge</hi> had put you. Now for the Service of the Government, you have my free conſent to ſhew this to your Honeſt Neighbours (eſpecially to our Friends of <hi>Exeter</hi> and <hi>Totneſs.)</hi> Nay to any Man, for, tho as you know I pay a Deference to Sir <hi>E. Seymour,</hi> and a far greater to the Nations Repreſentatives, I am confident I ſhall not in this Juncture incur their diſpleaſure by naming a ſqueamiſh Conſcienced Gentleman, who (after 7 years Apprenticeſtip) will not go the Length to avow K. <hi>William</hi>'s Right to the Crown.</p>
            <p>When a Town is on Fire, the blowing up a Houſe is ſurely juſtifiable. Our Neighbour Nation once upon a time told a bigger Man than Sir <hi>E. S.</hi> that a King for ſome Crimes might <hi>Forefault;</hi> and had Sir <hi>E.</hi> been thrown out of the Houſe laſt Week, I ſhould not have laid it to Heart.</p>
            <p>I have long agoe reſolved to run a <hi>Muck</hi> againſt all the Enemies of this Government, and know by Conſequence that I am to expect no Quarter when it is overturned, which makes me now as fearleſs of being called to a Reckoning, as I am of this Plot; but ſhould that betide me, I wiſh it may be before the preſent Commiſſioners for Accounts.</p>
            <p>I have Sir, been ſo prolix that I cannot now enter into the particulars of this Diabolical Conſpiracy, but for your Comfort it is happily diſcovered, and moſt miraculouſly diſappointed. Admiral <hi>Ruſſell</hi> now blocks up the <hi>French</hi> Fleet about <hi>Calais,</hi> and I hope to tell you by the next that he has deſtroyed them.</p>
            <p>The Tower of <hi>London</hi> was to have been delivered up to the <hi>French Cut-Throats,</hi> and they ſay by Major <hi>Hawley</hi> an Officer there; it is certain he is ſecured. Take Heart my Friend, for our Enemies will not eaſily get poſſeſſion of the Powder there, and I am confident all the <hi>Salt-Petre</hi> in <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> (ſhould 200 Tuns be diſcovered in any Vault there) will not ſupply enough to blow up this Government. For my part come what will, I reſolve never to be bribed into the <hi>Jacobite Party;</hi> no, tho I ſhould be tempted with the value of ſuch a Cargo, which Sir <hi>E. S.</hi> well knows is not leſs worth than 12000 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You muſt not expect a Licenſe to this, for Sir <hi>Roger L'Eſtrange</hi> had laſt Night the Miſhap to be committed Cloſe Priſoner to <hi>Newgate.</hi>
