            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This Conſcience I ſay, is an act (not a habit) of the reaſon, or intellect (not of the will) by which it preſcribes what is good or evil, right or wrong, to be done or undone; if we do wel it affords us a continuall Feaſt; if evill, <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris</hi> his braſen Bull is not ſuch a tormentor; &amp; ſomuch the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in that it is unavoydable, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying us where ever we

go, as the ſhaddow doth the body as the evill ſpirit haunted <hi>Saul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are foure infirmities to which the Conſcience is obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, 1. Error, 2 Opinion, 3. Doubts, 4. Scrupuloſite.</p>
            <p n="1">1 An erring Conſcience is a bad Iudge; yet the Dictats thereof muſt be obeyed, becauſe it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be the law, will, and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of God; who therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth ſuch a conſcience, reſiſteth Gods will in his own interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and conceit, &amp; goeth againſt his own beleife; for he beleeves that he is in the right, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he is an error; now, <hi>What is done either againſt or without Faith, is Sinne.

lye to ſave the <hi>Hebrew</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants from drowning, had done againſt their faith and conſcience &amp; ſo been guilty of murther <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maly</hi> though not <hi>materialy,</hi> if they had not lyed.</p>
            <p>But we muſt note that though we are bound never to reſiſt the erring conſcience, yet we are not obliged, alwayes to follow it; for if the error be voluntarily contracted, we are not tyed by any obligation to yeeld obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to it; yet we are bound by a ſimple ligation not to doe any thing againſt it, becauſe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience beleeves this error to be truth, &amp; remaines as yet not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced; untill which time, theſe actions which in themſelves are materially evill, yet are not evill
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119965:14"/>
formally; as when a man lyeth with his neighbours wife, beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to be his own, he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth adultery <hi>materially</hi> &amp; in effect, though not <hi>formally</hi> or in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and intention; and for the ſame reaſon the Dictates of an erroneous conſcience, are to be preferred to the precepts of a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior until the error be removed by the Superior, who cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne us to do that which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes the law of nature, but to do any thing againſt our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, were to thwart and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that very law of nature.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Opinion</hi> is the ſecond infirmity to which the conſcience is ſubject in this life, by reaſon we are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the true cauſes of things, without which there can be no
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119965:15"/>
knowledge; for <hi>Scire est per cauſas cognoſcere;</hi> but opinion is a bad rule for men to ſquare their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by; ſeeing we can never give a firme aſſent unto that which we perfectly know not but by way of probabilitie, therefore the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is timerous <hi>cum formidinecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarij;</hi> yet it is opinion that for the moſt part bares rule in the world, and cauſeth men without ſcruple of Conſcience to runne headlong into many errors and abſurdities; it is opinion that imboldens men to perſecute without remorſe of conſcience al ſuch as diſſent from them, and in this they think they do GOD good ſervice; hence the <hi>Arians</hi> of old thought they were bound in Conſcience to perſecute the <hi>Orthodox Chriſtians,</hi> and ſo the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119965:15"/>
               <hi>Papiſts</hi> are led by the ſame opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at this day in perſecuting the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> diſſonant opinions have as well armed mens Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences with boldneſſe, as their hands with fire and ſword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt each other; the opinion of univerſalitie and antiquity hath kept the world ſo long in blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Popery, cauſing them without ſcruple of Conſcience to ſwallow down their groſſe errors which notwithſtanding <hi>Luther</hi> could, not diſgeſt; neither he of late nor <hi>Athanaſius</hi> of old, could ſatisfie their conſciences with the opinion of univerſalitie; the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the ſcholars have of their teachers worth and integrity, make them without any check of Conſcience maintaine &amp; defend
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119965:16"/>
even to their own undoing, and of the place where they live, their maſters errors, be they never ſo abſurd; and this is the cauſe that the Church hath been ſtil peſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſo many Hereſies; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that the Subject hath of the Princes authority and power, as alſo the neceſſity of obedience to his commands, makes them without any controlement of conſcience put in execution what ſoever he commands, be it right, or wrong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when they take an evil opinion of the prince, though he deſerve it not, their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſets them on work to riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: ſome <hi>Phyſitians</hi> think they may kil men with a ſafe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience by trying experiments: their conſcience doth not check

them for murther, becauſe they have an opinion that what they did, was for the furthring of their own knowledge, and the benefit of others: ſo from the opinion the <hi>Lawyer</hi> hath that it is lawfull for him to live by his Profeſſion, he makes no ſcruple to receive his Clients mony, and to plead for him in a wrong cauſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third infirmity of the Conſcience is doubting; to which ſo long as we are ſubject, our actions can neither ſtand with <hi>love</hi> nor <hi>faith,</hi> nor <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> not with <hi>love;</hi> for how ſhall we <hi>love</hi> God, when we doe that which wee doubt is not conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to his will: not with <hi>faith,</hi> for <hi>faith</hi> is an aſſurance and firm aſſent; but that can be neither aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

4. The fourth infirmity of the Conſcience is <hi>ſcrupuloſitie;</hi> a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe that gives it no reſt; for after it hath aſſented to one part, yet it remaines anxious and wavering, whither that be the righteſt part, it hath aſſented to, and is eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from its aſſent which it gave to this part, &amp; inclined to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the contrary, being troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at every ſmal conceit, &amp; ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, perplexed with every ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, &amp; imagination of ſin; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times making us feare that we have omitted what ſhould have been done: and ſometimes that that we have committed what ſhould not have been done; this ſickneſſe is ſometimes layd upon us by <hi>God,</hi> as a puniſhment of our ſins, and ſomtimes as a meanes
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119965:18"/>
to try our Faith, Conſtancy, and patience, &amp; its a part of our ſpritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all warfare; let us not then be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; the end of this tryall is not to hurt, but to help us; not to kill, but to ſave us; neither hath Satan any more power to vex our <hi>minds</hi> with ſuch ſcruples, then he had to afflict <hi>Iobs</hi> body with ſoares; he doeth it by permiſſion from God for our further weal: theſe ſcruples like the Angels of Satan are ſent to buffet us; but let us not deſpaire, Gods grace is ſufficient for us.</p>
            <p>The cauſes then of our ſcruples are principally, 1 God himſelfe, 2. inſtrumentally ſatan 3. the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with ſcruplous and rigid men, 4. hearing ſuch Sermons, reading of ſuch Bookes, as beget

and increaſe ſcruples in us, 5. the evill conſtitution alſo of our bodies, and the bad diſpoſition of the ſpleen, and braine.</p>
            <p>The cheifeſt means to cure us of theſe foure Diſeaſes, are 1. princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally Prayer, 2. then meditating on Gods word, 3. hearing of ſuch ſermons, &amp; converſing with ſuch Miniſters as are judicious, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Pious, who with the good <hi>Samaritan</hi> can poure Oyle of comfort into our wounds, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Balme of <hi>Gilead</hi> to our ſoules; and who have more need of ſuch ſpirituall Phyſitians, then they who are troubled in miude? <hi>For a wounded Conſcience who can beare?</hi> 4. abſtaning from conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with ſuch perſons, reading of ſuch Bookes, hearing of ſuch

and reſiſt their firſt' motions; <hi>principijs obſta:</hi> 9. We muſt ſet before our eyes the death of Chriſt which is of infinite value to ſave all ſinners; the bloud of Chriſt <hi>cleanſeth us from all ſinne,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn. Chriſt gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be a ranſome,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 6. likewiſe <hi>the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Gods mercy which is above all his workes, Pſalme</hi> 145. 9. <hi>The plentifulneſſe of Redemption with him, Pſalme</hi> 130. 7. <hi>The ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of his Grace,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. even in pardoning of grievous ſinners, as of <hi>David, Salomon, Manaſſes, Peter, Paul,</hi> and others; he doth not breake the bruiſed Reed, nor quench the ſmoaking Flax; hee did not deſpiſe the <hi>Canaanitiſh</hi> woman though a dog, nor <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>

though a Publican, nor the woman poſſeſſed with a Devill; nor the Thiefe upon the Croſſe, nor the Apoſtle that denyed him, nor the Apoſtle that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted him; He is a Father who will not reject, but imbrace his Prodigall ſonne if he returne; he is a Phyſitian who will not hurt, but cure the Patient that comes to him, hee invites all that are weary and laden, to come to him, and he will refreſh them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28. he calls upon all that are thirſtie to come to the water and drinke, <hi>Eſay</hi> 55. 1. Hee profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that hee came to call ſinners to repentance, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 13. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch places may be alleadged. 10. if we will not bee troubled with the ſcruples of Conſcience,

and the temptations ariſihg thence; wee muſt avoyd ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe, and too much retired<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; for Satan takes occaſion to aſſault us, when hee ſees us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, as hee dealt with Chriſt in the deſert. 11. Let us ſtrive for true knowledge, faith, love, and obedience, which are the maine remedies againſt all theſe diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Conſcience; for opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions prevaile where true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge failes; and where there is but little faith, there will bee much doubting; want of love is the cauſe of ſo many errors; and want of obedience to ſpirituall Superiors is the cauſe of ſo many ſcruples. Thus having poynted at the diſeaſes of the Conſcience, and their remedies, I will ſhew
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119965:21"/>
the <hi>credenda</hi> and <hi>agenda</hi> of a good Chriſtian, that is what we are bound to beleeve, and what with a ſafe &amp; good conſcience we are bound to doe.</p>
            <p>VVEE are bound in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to beleeve that there is a <hi>God;</hi> for even the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Atheists</hi> that ever were, have been accuſed, checked, judged, and affrighted by their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, even for their ſecret and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible ſins, intimating thereby that there is a ſecret and inviſible Indge, to whom they muſt give an account of thoſe hidden ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; many men have been checked by their Conſcience for doubting or denying that there is a God, but never was man check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119965:22"/>
by his Conſcience for beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Diety, but rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged thereto, and cheriſhed, being directed to beleeve this both by the light of nature, and the light of Grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2 And as we beleve there is a God, ſo we are bound to beleeve that there is but one GOD, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving both reaſons and Scripture, to induce us to this Faith; the ſimplicity, &amp; perfection of Gods nature, as alſo the unity of this univerſe force this beleif upon us.</p>
            <p n="3">3 We are bound in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to beleeve that God is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, becauſe he is not paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. 2. and that he is eternall, becauſe he is immutable, 3. and that he is the only ubiquitary entity, both 1. in regard of his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,

by which all things have exiſtence, 2. in reſpect of his knowledge, by which all things are naked to his eyes, 3. in reſpect of his power, to which all things are ſubjected. and 4. that he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit, becauſe he is not confined, by forme or matter, or his own nature. and 5. that he is the cheif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good, 1. becauſe he is cheif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appetible. 2. and the cheifeſt end of the creatures. 3. and the cheifeſt cauſe of all that perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and goodneſſe that is in the creature. 6. and that he is moſt perfect. 1. becauſe he is the cauſe of all things. 2. in whom are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the perfections of al his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, that ever were or ſhall be. 3. and becauſe he is not a paſſive, but an active principle. 4. neither

is there in him any defect at all, 7. and that he is moſt ſimple, becauſe in him there is neither compoſition nor parts, nor act &amp; poſſibilitie, nor can he be the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of things, 8. and that he is incomprehenſible, becauſe he is infinit, 9. and that he is inviſible, becauſe ſight is a bodyly act, which hath no proportion to a ſpirituall ſubſtance; and we ſee the ſpecies and ſimilitude of the object, but Gods perfection ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all ſimilitude, 10. and that he is truth it ſelfe, becauſe of that tranſcendent Conformitie which is between his intellect &amp; entity, 11. and that he is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-living becauſe he is the ever working God, for the excellency &amp; eternity of his operation ſhew

the excellency and eternity of his life 12. &amp; that he is omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, becauſe his eſſence is infinit, &amp; no wayes confined or limited.</p>
            <p n="4">4 We are bound in Conſcience to beleev that ther is in God a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of perſons, or three wayes of exiſtence, becauſe in the nature of God, there are three reall rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to wit, Paternity, Filiation, and Proceſſion; the Father alone is unbegott; the Son is of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as of his originall, not as of a cauſe, which includes, 1. priori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, 2. dependence, and 3. a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent eſſence, which things are not in God: the HOLY Ghoſt is of the Father, and the Son, not by way of Generation as the word is from the intellect, which is the property of the Son, who
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119965:24"/>
is therefore called the (Word,) but by way of proceſſion, or love; for the HOLY GHOST is ſaid to proceed from the Father, and Sonne, as theſe two perſons love each other mutually; hence the Holy Ghoſt loveth eſſentially and perſonally; eſſentially, as he is the love that proceeds from the Father, and the Sonne; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, as he from whom this love proceeds.</p>
            <p n="5">5 We are bound in Conſcience to beleeve the Creation of the World, becauſe we know this is affirmed by Scripture, and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men of all ages; becauſe God is omnipotent, wiſe and Good; becauſe the world is not God, therefore not infinit, nor eternall, neither in it ſelfe wholly or in the parts thereof.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:119965:24"/>
6 We are bound in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to beleeve that in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of time God was made man that his inviſible atributes of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, goodneſſe, juſtice, and power, might be made known to us; his wiſdome in finding out a way to pay ſo great a price; his goodneſſe, which is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative of it ſelfe, in that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed not the infirmitie and baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our nature; his juſtice in making man, whom Satan meant to deſtroy, the meanes of Satans own deſtruction: laſtly his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; for the Incarnation of the Son of God, was far greater then the Creation of the World.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Wee muſt beleeve that in CHRIST were the three paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of ſorrow, feare, and anger,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:119965:25"/>
1. of ſorrow or paine, for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of his Soule were natural, and his body was ſenſible; for as the evill of paine is apprehended by the outward ſenſe of touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo is the evill of ſorrow, by the inward ſenſe of imagination; theſe I call evils, not of ſin, but of puiſhment, 2. Feare was in Him, as it is from the apprehenſion of future evill; but not as it includes either the incertainty of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, or the perturbation of reaſon, for the one preſuppoſeth ignorance, the other ſin; 3. There was in him alſo the anger of zeale which proceeds of Iuſtice, but not the anger of revenge ariſing from ſin, or of the perturbation of reaſon.</p>
            <p n="8">8 We may with a cleare Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119965:25"/>
beleeve that Chriſt had two wills, other wayes he could not have had two natures; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, <hi>Apollinarius, Einy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> and <hi>Onefurious,</hi> maintaine the contrary; for an intelligent nature cannot be perfect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the will; therefore as God, his will was divine; as man, his will was humane; but as he was man, he was alſo a ſenſitive crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; therefore not only had he a rationall will, but alſo a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive appetite; by this, he willed the cup to paſſe from him; by that, he dranke of the cup, here was a diverſite of wils, but no contradiction, becauſe it was not <hi>ſecundum idem.</hi>

            <p n="9">9 We may ſafely beleeve that <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of CHRIST,

loſt not her virginity, neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor in, nor after the concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for otherwiſe this could not have ſtood either with the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Father that ſent Him, nor of the Son that was ſent, nor of the Holy Ghoſt that conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; nor yet with the end of CHRISTS Incarnation, which was to make us the ſons of God, by a pure and virgine like regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p n="10">10 We may ſafely beleeve that <hi>Mary</hi> is the Mother of God, though not of the Godhead; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was the Mother of that perſon, who is both God and Man; for this cauſe there is in Chriſt but one Filiation, if wee looke upon the ſubject or perſon, but two filiations if we reſpect the two natures.</p>

               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:119965:26"/>
11 We may ſafely beleeve that Chriſt was the cauſe of his own death; becauſe he did not hinder it, when he might, either by ſuppreſſing his perſecutors, or withdrawing himſelf from them, or by immortalizing his body, but he was acceſſary to his own Death indirectly only, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin, that by it he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy ſinne, and death, and him that had the power of death.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Wee may beleeve ſafely that though in Chriſts death and buriall, the ſoule was ſeparated from the body, yet his divinity was not ſeparated either from the ſoule or the body; for the gifts of God are irrevocable, and without repentance; and the gift of this <hi>Hypoſtaticall</hi> union was the

            <p n="13">13 We muſt beleeve that Chriſt roſe the third day with the ſcars of thoſe wounds which he received in his paſſion, both to confirme the truth of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and by them to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion to his Father for us; for they were as ſo many powerfull Orators, imployed by our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor to plead for us; beſids they were honourable badges of his victory; and love tokens of his true affection toward us, and marks of his enemies implacable malice.</p>
            <p n="14">
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:119965:27"/>
14 We muſt beleeve that <hi>Chriſt</hi> aſcended above al heavens, not by his own power, that is, of his humane nature, yet by his own power, that is of his Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and though it was againſt the nature of his earthly body to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, it was not againſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his body as it was the body of the Sonne of GOD, and as it was glorifyed, to aſcend. and this he did, that he might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a place for us; that from thence, as our King ſitting on his throne, he might give gifts unto men; as our high Preiſt he might enter into the holy place to make interceſſion for us; and as our Prophet he might, by ſending his Spirit from thence, in wardly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us.</p>
            <p n="15">
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:119965:28"/>
15 Wee muſt beleeve that Chriſt ſits on Gods right-hand, not as man only, by being Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatically united to the divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but as God alſo by eternall generation, injoying the ſame glory, felicity and power with the Father from eternitie; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although the humanitie of Chriſt is not to be honored with divine worſhip: yet the man Chriſt is to be adored as being united to God; the word huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie intimating the nature, but the word man, the whole perſon, becauſe of the Hypoſtaticall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="16">16 Wee muſt beleeve that Chriſt is Iudge of the quick and dead, not as God only, but as man alſo; for as in both natures
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119965:28"/>
he is our Mediator, and head of the Church, ſo in both he is our Iudge; and as in his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he was judged by the world, ſo in the ſame nature he ſhall judge the world; and becauſe no man hath ſeen God at any time, and the Iudge ſhould be viſible, therefore it is fit that Chriſt in the viſible forme and nature of man ſhould judge the world.</p>
            <p n="17">17 Wee may with a cleare Conſcience beleeve againſt the tenure of the <hi>Greeke</hi> Church, that the holy Ghoſt proceedeth from the Son, as well as from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for otherwayes in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons there would be a dualitie only, and not a Trinity, neither are the Son and holy Ghoſt otherwayes diſtinguiſhed but by

generation and proceſſion; and if the Sonne be the Wiſdom and Knowledge of the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt the love of both; he muſt doubtleſſe proceed from the Sonne, becauſe Love pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds of Knowledge.</p>
            <p n="18">18 Wee muſt beleeve that there is one Church univerſall, in reſpect of time, place, and perſon, which neither hath erred, nor can erre, in things fundamentall and abſolutely neceſſary; and that the head of this Church, is Chriſt only, both in reſpect of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie, dominion, efficacie and perfection, as containeing al thoſe graces of ſpirituall ſenſe, motion, life, and other good things, which he imparts to his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is

not this Catholick Church, but a miſhapen and lame member ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: and that neither her antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor multitudes, nor ſucceſſion, nor miracles, nor continuance, nor unity, nor outward ſplendor, &amp;c. are true markes of a true Church.</p>
            <p n="19">19 Wee are bound in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to beleeve, that there is a Communion and Fellowſhip of the Saints, among themſelves here on earth, conſiſting in their mutuall loves, in imparting ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall gifts, and ſupporting each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with their mutuall helps: as alſo with the Saints in Heaven, they praying for us, and we earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly deſireing to be with them. and with Chriſt alſo, as the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches with the root, builders with

            <p>Thus have I breifly ſet down what every man is bound in conſcience to beleeve, what to practice, and what er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors concerning matter of faith he is bound to avoyd; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines that I ſhould alſo ſhew what is to be avoyded in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of practice, but becauſe I have already ſpoke of ſome of them, which are moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, and <hi>rectum eſt index ſui &amp; obliqui,</hi> he that knowes

what he is bound to do, cannot be ignorant of what he is bound to avoyd; therefore what wee have already ſet down may ſuffice to pacifie a mans conſcience, and to make him a perfect Chriſtian; in theſe unhapy times of ours; we ſee chriſtianity was never more profeſſed, conſcience never more pretended; but alas truth never leſſe beleeved; goodnes never leſſe practiſed; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the conſcience never more cheated; ſo that in name we are <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but in many doctrinall poynts plaine <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> and in our practice very <hi>Pagans,</hi> or rather <hi>Atheiſts;</hi> God grant we may indeavour

to be, what we would ſeeme to be, and lay aſide our <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall Vizards,</hi> by which wee deceive the eyes of men; but the peircing rays of that all ſeeing eye, who ſees us in the darke, and knowes of our down ſitting, and up-riſing, and our thoughts long before, we cannot delude; our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are ſeared with a hot iron, or faſt aſleepe, if they can content themſelves with a mouthfull of Scripture phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſes, having our eyes full of wantonneſſe, our hearts full of malice, and our hands full of blood; be not deceived, the Conſcience of a <hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Pagan</hi> will not be thus ſatisfied:

St. <hi>Pauls</hi> conſcience was voyd of offence towards God and towards men; and he ſhewes that a good conſcience is ſtill accompanyed with charity, a pure heart, and with faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained; neither can that conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be good, which is not purged from dead works to ſerve the living GOD.</p>
