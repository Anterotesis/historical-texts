            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PUBLISHER
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THat the following Discourses are
Genuine and Authentick; and were
really writ by that excellent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
whose name they bear; can never be
doubted by the Learned and Iudicious <hi>Reader.</hi>
For the Composures of that incomparable Pen
are so Close and Logical, and his Stile so Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine
<pb facs="tcp:65856:3"/>
and Convincing, as not easily to be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
by any other Hand.</p>
            <p>However to justifie my Integrity herein
(since <hi>posthumous</hi> Writings lye under Suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
I shall give this further Satisfaction;
That about <hi>Twenty</hi> Years since, I received
these Papers from the Hands of that well-known
good Man Mr. <hi>Io. Pullen</hi> of <hi>MAGDALEN-HALL,</hi>
his Lordship's Domestic Chaplain.
Who, upon my Desire, did communicate not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
these, but several other <hi>Remains</hi> of the
same venerable Name.</p>
            <p>Amongst which, there is a Fragment of
an Answer to Dr. <hi>Baylie's Challeng.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or no it was ever finished, I have no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Conjecture. But if it were, and could
be found, the Publishing of it at this Iun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
would be Seasonable and Useful.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:65856:3"/>
            <p>For though that Pamphlet is a Piece of as
transparent <hi>Sophistry,</hi> as was ever called
<hi>Demonstration;</hi> and though the Weakness
and Inconsequence of it hath been sufficiently
displayed; yet such is the Pleasure of some
Men, that it hath been <hi>Printed</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed</hi>
with as much Assurance, as if not the
least notice had been ever taken of it.</p>
            <p>The same Remark is obvious concerning these
following Tracts.</p>
            <p>'Tis surprising to observe (after these things
have been so clearly and fully stated) that
we should ever and anon be thus pelted with
that impertinent Question, <hi>Where was your
Church before Luther?</hi> Our Venerable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
doth tell them where it was. And he doth it
with such an Evidence and Strength of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
as is peculiar to Himself. For whereas
<pb facs="tcp:65856:4"/>
the Writings of other Men may indeed <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince;</hi>
Those of Bishop <hi>Sanderson</hi> do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<hi>Silence.</hi>

            <head>A
DISCOURSE
Concerning the
VISIBILITY
OF THE
True Church.</head>
            <p>THE word [CHURCH] hath,
among others, these <hi>four</hi> spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Significations. Being taken
for,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The whole Company of Gods
Elect, actually made Members of <hi>Christ</hi>
by vertue of an inward effectual Calling
to Faith and Godliness. This we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
call the <hi>Invisible Church,</hi> or the
Church of Gods Elect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The whole Company of all
those throughout the World, who by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65856:5"/>
their Doctrine and Worship do out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
make Profession of the Name of
Christ. This we call the <hi>Universal Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
Church; Or, the <hi>Catholick</hi> Christian
Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Some particular, distinct, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>National, Provincial</hi> or other greater
or smaller Part of the Universal. As
we say; the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the
Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
This we call a <hi>Particular Visible</hi>
Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> By a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> the Bishops,
Pastors, and Governours of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Churches, lawfully authorized to
represent the whole Church, whereof
they are Governours, as to some special
Intents. This we call a Church <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The word [TRUTH] applyed
to any Subject, is taken either <hi>Absolute,</hi>
or <hi>Respective.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Absolutely</hi> a thing is true, when it
hath <hi>veritatem Entis &amp; Essentiae;</hi> with
all those Essential things, that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65856:5"/>
to the bare Being and Existence of
it. <hi>Respectively,</hi> when over and above these
Essentials, it hath also such Accidental
conditions and Qualities, as should make
it perfect and commendably good.</p>
            <p>A Thing may be <hi>true</hi> in the <hi>first</hi>
sense, and yet not true in the <hi>second</hi> but
<hi>false.</hi> As a Man may be a true Man
<hi>(animal rationale)</hi> and yet a false Knave.
A Woman a true Wife <hi>(nupta viro)</hi> and
yet a false Quean. A Speech a true
Proposition (having <hi>Subjectum Praedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
&amp; Copulam)</hi> and yet a false Lye.</p>
            <p>A <hi>True</hi> Church, according to the <hi>first</hi>
sense and <hi>absolutely,</hi> is every Church that
in her Doctrine and Worship professeth
the Faith of Christ, whether soundly
or corruptly. But in the <hi>second</hi> sense
and <hi>respectively,</hi> that only is a true
Church whose Doctrine and Worship is
pure, at least in a good measure, from
Errors and Superstitions. So as other
Churches which either maintain <hi>Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
Doctrines, or prescribe <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
may be justly called, at least wise
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65856:6"/>
in comparison with this, and in this
<hi>second</hi> sense, <hi>false</hi> Churches and not
true.</p>
            <p>A total and utter Defection from the
<hi>whole</hi> Faith of Christ, in Doctrine and
in Worship, destroys the very <hi>Being</hi> of
a Church, and maketh it no Church at
all. But a defection from the <hi>purity</hi> of
Faith, doth not take away the <hi>Being</hi>
of a Church. It remains still a true
Church <hi>Absolutely,</hi> but only maketh it
an Impure and Corrupt Church; and
so far forth a false Church <hi>Respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Corruptions in Doctrine and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
as they are greater or lesser, so
they make a Church more or less false
comparatively: and as they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
upon Men with greater or lesser
exaction, they do more or less justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy;
whether a Separation from, or an
opposition against, such a false Church,
and in some cases enforce it.</p>
            <p>When betwixt <hi>two</hi> Churches, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Doctrine or Worship, Question
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65856:6"/>
is made; Whether of them is the true
Church? it must be understood not
in the <hi>first</hi> sense and <hi>absolutely</hi> (for so
both are true, and <hi>(ergo)</hi> equally true
Churches, for <hi>vero nihil verius)</hi> but <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively</hi>
and comparatively and in the
<hi>second</hi> sense, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether of them
maintains the Doctrine, together with
the Worship, taught by Christ and his
Apostles, in the greater measure of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and freer from Error and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition?</p>
            <p>[VISIBILITY] as to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
imports such a state of a thing,
as wherein 'tis evident and discernable
more or less by sensible Marks; so as
a Man may infallibly know it thereby,
and say; <hi>Here it is.</hi> Which <hi>Visibility</hi>
hath several Degrees; and applyed to
the Church may be several ways con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> A Thing is visible in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Degree, where it doth it self <hi>ferire
oculos,</hi> as it were; and is so eminently
and gloriously conspicuous, that a Man
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65856:7"/>
(unless he wilfully shuts his Eyes) cannot
chuse but see it. As the Sun in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament
is visible, when it shines forth
in its greatest Lustre at Noon-Day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In an inferior Degree; when
'tis discernable even outwardly, but
not at the first sight, or in any glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Splendor; but with due and
serious and intent Observation. As
some Stars in an over-cast Evening to
them that with a stedfast Eye look for
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And in a yet lower Degree;
when its not discernable outwardly,
or at all, to any but those only who
more nearly partake of it. As the
light of a Candle in a close private
Room, is visible to those only that be
in the Room.</p>
            <p>In every of which Degrees <hi>Visibility</hi>
applyed to the Church and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
thereof, may be consider'd in a <hi>Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold</hi>
Respect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Of the Men themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:65856:7"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of their general Profession of
Christianity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Of their particular different
Tenents from other Men or Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Of the truth of their particular
Tenents.</p>

               <head>Theses.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> the Church in the <hi>first</hi> and
most proper Signification, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Church of Gods Elect, is wholly
and altogether <hi>Invisible.</hi> But of this the
present Question is not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Universal Christian
Church upon Earth hath never failed
from the whole Faith, nor ever shall
fail to the Worlds end, in such sort
but that still in some Part or other of
it, it hath been, is, and shall be visible
more or less, and that <hi>externally</hi> in the
<hi>first</hi> or <hi>second</hi> Degree of Visibility;
both in the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>second</hi> Respects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whence it follows; that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
<hi>Truth</hi> in the <hi>First</hi> sense, there
never <hi>hath</hi> wanted, <hi>doth</hi> or <hi>shall</hi> want
upon Earth, a true and distinct Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Church, in some Place or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65856:8"/>
externally visible, more or less
in the Degrees and Respects above
specified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Every <hi>Particular</hi> visible
Church may fail, not only from the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
of Faith, but also from the whole
Faith it self; and so may cease to be
a true Christian Church, even so much
as in the <hi>First</hi> Sense; and may become
no Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The <hi>Universal</hi> Christian Church
(consisting of all Particular visible
Churches together and at once) may
by the prevailing of Heresy and Idolatry,
be brought to such a general Defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the outward Face of it, though
not from the whole Faith, yet from
the Purity of Faith both in Doctrine
and Worship, that for a long time to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
there may not be found upon
Earth (taking <hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>second</hi> Sense)
any true Particular Church visibly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from the rest, by their outward
Freedom from the common Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
so much as in the <hi>second</hi> much less
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65856:9"/>
in the <hi>first</hi> Degree of Visibility; either
in the <hi>third</hi> or <hi>fourth</hi> Respects. And
this is that Part of the Church especially
under <hi>Antichrist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That even in the Times of
the greatest and most general Defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
there have been always particular
Men (and those eminent either for
Number, Place, Learning or Godliness)
who though living in the midst of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Churches, and in the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and visible Profession thereof, have
yet according to the measure of their
Grace and Knowledg, and the exigence
of Times and Occasions, either</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Openly resisted the Errors, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions
and Corruptions of their Times;
Or <hi>secondly,</hi> Noted the Corruptions as
they grew and complained of them,
and desired Reformation; Or <hi>thirdly,</hi> In
private dissented from them in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of the most dangerous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
and kept themselves free from
the foulest Corruptions, though carried
with the Stream of the common. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65856:9"/>
to embrace the rest. Whereof
we are to presume they repented ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Explicitely,</hi> if God gave them to
see their Errors; or at least wise <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely,</hi>
in the Mass of their ignorant
and unknown Sins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Although such particular
Men were not always so locally and
generally seperated from the rest, as
to make a visible distinct particular
Church by themselves in the <hi>first</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Visibility; yet in these Men
did the Succession of the true Church
(taking it comparatively and in the
<hi>second</hi> Sense) especially consist, and the
Visibility of it continue in the Time of
universal Defection. In which Men
the true Church continues visible al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
and perpetually, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption;
and that ever in the <hi>fourth</hi>
Respect, <hi>viz.</hi> in regard of the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
Truth of their Doctrine; in the
<hi>third</hi> Degree of Visibility <hi>viz.</hi> in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Estate and to themselves; and
sometimes also (though perhaps not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways)
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65856:10"/>
visible externally, and to their
very Enemies more or less, in the <hi>second</hi>
Degree of Visibility, and in the <hi>Three</hi>
first Respects.</p>

            <p>THE Church of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi>
Church is taken in a <hi>Threefold</hi>
Latitude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Respectively to the <hi>Place;</hi> for
that Church which is in the City, or
Territory, or Diocess of <hi>Rome.</hi> As
we say the Church of <hi>Geneva,</hi> or the
Church of <hi>Venice.</hi> And so St. <hi>Paul</hi>
wrote an Epistle to the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> as he did to the Churches of
<hi>Corinth, Ephesus</hi> and other particular
Cities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Respectively to the <hi>State</hi> of
the <hi>Empire,</hi> for the whole <hi>Latine</hi> or
<hi>Western</hi> Churches, as they are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
from the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Eastern</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:65856:11"/>
Churches, and from the <hi>African</hi> and
<hi>Southern</hi> Churches. Because by reason
of the <hi>Empire,</hi> these Churches had a
nearer Communion among themselves
then with other Churches; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> as <hi>primae
sedis Episcopum;</hi> or the Patriarch of the
West; as other Bishops were of the
<hi>Greek, Asian,</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Respectively to the <hi>Faith;</hi>
for all particular Churches <hi>aggregatim,</hi>
that acknowledg Subjection to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
See of <hi>Rome;</hi> and entirely Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate

            <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>FIrst,</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (which of
the <hi>Three</hi> ways soever taken) is
not the <hi>Universal</hi> Christian Church, but
only a Part thereof, or a <hi>Particular</hi>
Church, or Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ever
since the first Plantation of it hath
continued a <hi>true</hi> Church, taking <hi>Truth</hi>
in the <hi>first</hi> Sense; and considering the
Church of <hi>Rome Materially</hi> as it is a
Church. But so hath the Church of
<hi>England</hi> also, and many other Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath
no special Promise or Privilege, above
other Particular Churches, of Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
from falling; either from the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Faith, or the whole Faith it
self.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:65856:12"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> which
way soever taken, hath long since fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Purity of Faith, both in
the Doctrine and Worship of it. And
so consider'd <hi>formally,</hi> in regard of
those Points which are properly of
<hi>Popery,</hi> is become a <hi>False</hi> and Corrupt
Church; and is indeed an <hi>Antichristian</hi>
Synagogue, and not a true Christian
Church; Taking Truth in the <hi>second</hi>
Sense.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Doctrinal Errors of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> do not <hi>directly</hi> and
immediately overthrow the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Faith, as the Heresy of the
<hi>Arrian</hi> Churches did, but <hi>mediately</hi> and
by necessary Consequence they do. As
in the Points of <hi>Merits, Mass, Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The bare Teaching, even <hi>ex
Cathedrâ,</hi> of the Doctrinal Errors of
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (in as much as
they do not overthrow the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but <hi>ex consequenti</hi> and indirectly)
is not enough of it self alone to enforce
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65856:13"/>
or justify an outward Separation from
her; But the imposing these Errors
upon the Consciences of Men, to be
believed as of necessity, is Damnable.
And doth not only justify a Separation
already made, but also bindeth <hi>sub Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tali</hi>
all true Christians to such a Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The Worship required and
performed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is in
most Things Superstitious; and in
some lately Idolatrous: and such as
wherein a good Christian cannot law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
Communicate with her.</p>
               <p>So as if there were nothing else,
yet her <hi>Idolatry</hi> were enough to justify
and enforce such a Separation.</p>

            <head>Concerning
Protestant
CHURCHES.</head>
            <p>BY the <hi>Protestant</hi> Churches we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
those visible Particular
Churches, which having by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Separation freed themselves from
the Tyranny and Idolatry of Popery,
have more or less <hi>reformed</hi> the Doctrine
and Worship from <hi>Popish</hi> Corruptions, and
restored them more or less to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and <hi>Primitive</hi> Purity.</p>
            <p>Now such Churches may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
either <hi>Materially</hi> or <hi>Formally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, <hi>Materially.</hi> When we consider
those Churches, to whom it happens thus
to be Reformed, barely and precisely as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65856:14"/>
               <hi>Local</hi> and Particular visible Churches;
without respect had to their present <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,</hi>
or former <hi>Corrupt</hi> Estate, or to
the Substance of their Faith. As when
we say, The Church of <hi>England,</hi> The
Church of <hi>Denmark.</hi> The Church of
<hi>Saxony,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Formally.</hi> The <hi>Protestant</hi>
Churches may again be consider'd <hi>two</hi>
ways, in respect of a <hi>Two-fold</hi> Form.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> An outward and <hi>accidental</hi>
Form. <hi>Secondly,</hi> An inward and, as it
were, <hi>essential</hi> Form.</p>
            <p>The inward Form ever giveth <hi>Esse,</hi>
but the outward often giveth <hi>Nomen.</hi>
The <hi>outward</hi> Form is barely the State of
Reformation, which supposeth another
former Estate of Deformity or Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
out of which respect, they have
the Name and Title of <hi>Protestant</hi> and
Reformed Churches. But the <hi>inward</hi>
Form is the Substance of their <hi>Faith</hi> thus
reformed, in their Doctrine and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
from the Corruptions wherewith
Popery had infected it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:65856:14"/>
Which Substance of Faith in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Churches, may be consider'd
differently in the <hi>Positive</hi> Points of their
Faith and in the <hi>Negative.</hi> The <hi>Positive</hi>
Points, or <hi>Affirmative</hi> Articles of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith, are they which make us true
Christian Churches. For in our <hi>Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
we teach the ancient Faith of Christ,
and his Apostles, and the Primitive
Church. And in our <hi>Negative,</hi> we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
the Innovations and Corruptions
of latter Times.</p>

            <head>To the QUESTION then,
Where Our CHVRCH was
before Luther?</head>
            <head type="sub">I Answer;</head>
            <p>
               <hi>FIrst,</hi> Taking our Protestant Churches
<hi>Materially,</hi> as namely the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> it <hi>was</hi> where it <hi>is, viz.</hi> in
<hi>England.</hi> Where by the great Mercy of
God, it hath continued a visible Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Church from the first Plantation of
it, by <hi>Apostles,</hi> or Apostolical Men,
without Interruption (though not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
without Error and Corruption)
unto this Day. And herein it need
not yield to the very Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
it self; or to any other Church under
Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:65856:15"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Taking the Protestant
Church <hi>Formally,</hi> in respect of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Faith, the Professors of it have
been in some Degree or other visible, as
well before <hi>Luther</hi> as since. But yet
differently in the <hi>Affirmatives</hi> and in the
<hi>Negatives</hi> of our Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Taking the Protestant Church
<hi>Formally,</hi> in respect of the outward
Form, <hi>viz.</hi> as under the State of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;
we will freely confess;
There was no such Reformed or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Church before <hi>Luther</hi> as now there
is. For a Church could not be said to
be <hi>Reformed</hi> till it was <hi>Deformed.</hi> No more
than a Man can be said to be stript of
a Motly Coat, before he had it on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Protestant Church for
Substance of Faith in the <hi>Affirmative</hi>
Doctrine, hath continued <hi>visibly</hi> from
Christ and his Apostles without Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as well before as since <hi>Luther;</hi>
according to the Tenor of our <hi>Second</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:65856:16"/>
and <hi>Third Theses.</hi> In which our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
and we agree; witness the
Articles of our Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Substance of Faith, as
concerning the Worship, Maintain'd
and Practis'd in the Protestant Church
of <hi>England,</hi> hath continued Visible in
like manner in all Ages; as well before
as since <hi>Luther.</hi> Witness our <hi>Service-Book;</hi>
Wherein our Adversaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are not able to except against
any thing contained. Only they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of some Defects. But that
belongs not to the <hi>Affirmatives,</hi> but
to the <hi>Negatives</hi> of our Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The <hi>Negative</hi> Tenets of
our <hi>Protestant</hi> Church, wherein she
Renounceth the Errors and Idolatries
of the <hi>Romish</hi> (for so much as they are
<hi>Negatives)</hi> are not capable of a <hi>visible</hi>
Profession, in such Sort as <hi>Affirmatives</hi>
are. Yet thus far our Church was
<hi>visible</hi> in respect of these <hi>Negatives</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65856:16"/>
               <hi>Luther, viz.</hi> In the Primitive Times,
for the first <hi>Six Hundred</hi> Years especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and some other Ages after also, all
Orthodoxal Particular Churches were
visible Professors of our Faith. In as
much as in their <hi>Writings,</hi> where we
were <hi>Affirmative,</hi> they were Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
also. Where we are <hi>Negative,</hi>
they are either <hi>Negative</hi> or <hi>Doubtful,</hi>
or <hi>Divided,</hi> or <hi>Silent.</hi> Which very Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
is enough to make them <hi>ours</hi>
as to this Intent. For who can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
they should purposely confute
those Errors, which were (many of
them) not so much as thought on in
their Times.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:65856:17"/>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> In succeeding Times, when
Errors and Superstitions began to grow
to some Head (through the Factions
of Princes, the Pride of the Clergy,
and the common Ignorance of the
Times.) As namely, about the Year
<hi>Nine Hundred,</hi> and thenceforth till the
Times of <hi>Luther,</hi> our Protestant
Church was not visibly distinct from
the corrupt <hi>Romish</hi> (according to the
Tenor of our <hi>Fifth Thesis)</hi> but ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with it. Yet it had thus far forth
visible Professors; That there were in
every Age before <hi>Luther,</hi> some whose
Names and Opinions, have been by
God's good Providence preserved in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
and Records (notwithstanding
the indirect Endeavors of the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
to root out the Memory of
them) who complained of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
and contradicted the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and Abuses of <hi>Popery,</hi> some
in one Point, and some in another;
some in most of all those Points where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65856:17"/>
we now dissent; and that in such
Degrees and Respects of Visibility, as
we have declared in our <hi>Sixth</hi> and
<hi>Seventh Theses.</hi>
