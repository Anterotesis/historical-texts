            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Our Bleſſed Saviour has therefore (who beſt might) umpired the buſineſs, and aſſured you, That <hi>by this ſhall all men know you to be his Diſciples, if you love one another.</hi> In the name, and for the ſake of our Common Saviour, I call upon you my <hi>Brethren</hi> of the <hi>Separation</hi> (unleſs you value them who abuſe the Holy name of Jeſus more than Jeſus himſelf) That you weigh and duly ponder our Bleſſed Saviours words, and ſtudy the Advice of his Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul.</hi> And you will then upon mature calm thoughts not be ſo ready to inveigh againſt the <hi>MISCHIEF</hi> of <hi>IMPOSITI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ONS,</hi> as to abhor the <hi>UNREASONABLENESS</hi> of <hi>SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PARATION.</hi> In a word, ſince <hi>Charity</hi> is the moſt extenſive, and <hi>Humility</hi> the foundation of all Chriſtian <hi>Graces;</hi> whether it be more equal, That the <hi>Eſtabliſhed Laws Eccleſiaſtical</hi> ſhould vail to <hi>private humour,</hi> or you our brethren of the Separation, kindly and modeſtly ſubmit your ſelves to theſe <hi>Laws,</hi> let your own <hi>private Conſciences</hi> be the <hi>Sole Judges.</hi>

that hath no Plea) you alledge our comorting in Ceremonies, and ſay, ſtill we tarry in the Suburbs. Grant that theſe were as ill as an Enemy can make them, or can pretend them: You are deceived, if you think the Walls of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſtand upon <hi>Ceremonies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Subſtantial Errors</hi> are both her Foundation and Frame.</p>
            <p>Theſe Ritual obſervations are not ſo much as Tile and Reed, rather like to ſome Fan upon the Roof; for Ornament, more than uſe: not parts of the Building but neceſſary Appendances. If you take them otherwiſe, you wrong the Church; if thus, and yet depart, you wrong it and your ſelf: As if you would have perſuaded Righteous <hi>Lot</hi> not to ſtay in <hi>Zoar,</hi> becauſe it was ſo near <hi>Sodom.</hi> I fear, if you had ſeen the Mony-changers in the Temple, however you would have pray'd or taught there: Chriſt did it, not forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the place but ſcourging the Offenders: And this is the Valour of Chriſtian Teachers: To oppoſe Abuſes, not to run away from them: Where ſhall you not thus find <hi>Babylon?</hi> Would you have run from <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi> becauſe of her Wafers? Or from <hi>Corinth,</hi> for her diſorder'd Love Feaſts? Either run out of the World, or your flight is Vain. If expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of Change teach you not, that you ſhall find your <hi>Babylon</hi> every where, return not. Compare the place you have left, with that you have choſen: Let not fear of ſeeming to repent over-ſoon, make you partial. Lo, there a common harbour of all Opinions, of all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies; if not a mixture. Here you drew in the free and clear Air of the Goſpel, without that odious compoſition of <hi>Judaiſm, Arrianiſm, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm:</hi> There you live in the ſtench of theſe and more. You are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of pity, if you will approve your miſery. Say, if you can, That the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> (if ſhe were not yours) is not an Heaven to <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> How is it then, that our Gnats are harder to ſwallow, than their Camels? And that whilſt all Chriſtendom magnifies our happineſs and applauds it; your handful alone, ſo deteſts our Enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that you deſpiſe our Graces? See whether in this you make not God a loſer.</p>
            <p>The thanks of all his favours is loſt, becauſe you want more: and in the mean time, who gains by this Sequeſtration, but <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Hell?</hi> How do they inſult in this Advantage, that our Mother's own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren condemn her for Unclean, that we are dayly weakened by our Diviſions, that the rude multitude hath ſo palpable a mortive to diſtruſt us? Sure, you intended it not: but if you had been their hired Agent you could not have done our Enemies greater ſervice.</p>
            <p>The God of Heaven open your Eyes, that you may ſee the unjuſtice of that Zeal which hath tranſported you: and turn your heart to an endeavour of all Chriſtian ſatisfaction: otherwiſe, your Souls ſhall find too late, that it had been a Thouſand times better to <hi>ſwallow</hi> a <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,</hi> than to <hi>rend</hi> a <hi>Church:</hi> yea, That even Whoredoms and Murders ſhall abide an eaſier Anſwer than <hi>SEPARATION.</hi> I have done if only I have adviſed you of that fearful threatning of the <hi>Wiſe man. The Eye that mocketh his FATHER, and deſpiſeth the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his MOTHER, The Ravens of the Valley ſhall pick it out, and the young Eagles eat it.</hi>
