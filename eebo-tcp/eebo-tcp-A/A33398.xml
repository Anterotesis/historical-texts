         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

RIGHT HONOURABLE
JOHN
LORD <hi>CH<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RCHILL.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THere are ſeveral things in
the World that carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with them no real
uſe or profit; but ſerve only to
fill up the vacuities of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
and pleaſe purely upon the
account of Variety: Among this
claſs of Beings ſome Men have
<pb facs="tcp:60915:3"/>
graciouſly vouchſafed to rank all
Eſſayers in this kind: and our
Authors further add, That if Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ever made any thing in Vain,
'twas a Poet. Well, for once let
Poets have the worſhipful Name
of <hi>Jeſters</hi> to Mankind; let us grant
for once, That they are but <hi>Riſus
plorantis Mundi,</hi> as was ſaid of the
Rainbow, the Sport and Caprice of
Nature; Men work'd off when ſhe
was in an excellent merry vein.
Yet hard Fate it is, That while
like Silk-Worms, they unravel their
very Bowels for the Pleaſure and
Luxury of Mankind; they muſt
lye Entomb'd in their own bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms.
We read, I confeſs, of few
of the Tribe that have been Lord
Mayors or Secretaries of State, Men
of vaſt Buſineſs or Politicks: Yet
<pb facs="tcp:60915:3"/>
let me oppoſe to this bold Slander,
by way of Apology, for the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of Poetry, what ſtands Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
of the Famous <hi>Alcaeus,</hi> that
great Poet and Souldier, who uſed
to make his Speeches in Verſe at
the head of his Army; and
thought there was as much Martial
Muſick in the Harmonious Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Numbers, as in the lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
noiſe of Drums and Hautboys.
Nay we further read, Poets were
the Civility Maſters to Mankind,
and the only Divines of the old
World: and even the greateſt
Preachers of our days are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
to make uſe of their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Notes,
and beſpangle their
Diſcourſe with the Golden Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of their Compoſitions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60915:4"/>
I queſtion not, but Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
does preſently fore-ſee what
Advantage I intend to make of
this Preamble; For where now
ſhou'd perſecuted <hi>Poetry</hi> fly, but
to the Patronage of the Great?
Whoſe very Title, at the Front of
its Productions, is Charm enough
againſt all the peeviſh Bolts of an ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging
Age. And, I hope, Your
Lordſhip will the more eaſily par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
the Preſumption, in prefixing
Your awful Name to theſe Trifles,
when You ſhall conſider, That the
Greateſt Men the World yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd,
have been Your Fellow-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers,
have been peſter'd with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
of this kind: The great <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi>
had <hi>Ennius</hi> always in his Camp:
And a greater than he, the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian</hi>
Youth, carried a whole Knot
<pb facs="tcp:60915:4"/>
of the Brothers of the Quill, into
<hi>Aſia,</hi> with him. And Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
may, with Modeſty enough,
put in for a Share in this Privilege,
of having <hi>Poeta a latere;</hi> whoſe
Sword has already acted Wonders;
and will in time, no queſtion, cut
out more Work for Heroick Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
than the ableſt Pen can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave.</p>
            <p>But ſtill, <hi>My Lord,</hi> theſe Motives
had been too weak, had not Your
Natural Candor and Ingenuity o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
a way for this bold Attempt:
And here I have but too large a
Field to expatiate in. I may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſay, You poſſeſs all the Virtues,
ſeparate from the Vices of a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier.
All that have the Honour of
Your Lordſhip's Acquaintance, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
You Maſter of a Soul, that
<pb facs="tcp:60915:5"/>
is unruffled with Paſſion, undiſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
with the Freakiſhneſs of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;
where Affability with State,
Humility with Greatneſs, meet and
center.</p>
            <p>This is Great and Illuſtrious: But
Your Lordſhip's ſteady and unby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſs'd
Loyalty, is the Brighteſt Star
in this Conſtellation of Virtues: Far
from the Humor of ſome <hi>Male-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents</hi>
of our Age, who upon the
leaſt Pique, and Court-Diſguſt, fly
off to the Faction; not unlike the
Fellow, who had <hi>God</hi> on one ſide
of his Shield, and the Devil on the
other, with this Motto, <hi>If You won't
have me, here's One will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, when Nature had fitly
fram'd Your Mind, ſhe left not
off here, but took order the fair In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant
ſhou'd be lodg'd in as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
<pb facs="tcp:60915:5"/>
a Body; a Structure of ſuch
admirable Contrivance and Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
that I muſt here apply what
<hi>Plato</hi> has ſaid of <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> That
the Souls of Vulgar Perſons are
lodg'd in their Bodies, but the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of <hi>Philoſophers</hi> in their Souls;
their very Bodies being ſo pure, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecate
and refin'd: Never was a
happier Match made by Fate, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in that bleſs'd Conjunction of
Your other Half, Your Honour'd
Lady, and Your Self; a Couple
ſo well pair'd by Heaven, that if
all the Beauty and Proportion of
both Sexes ſhou'd be loſt, here it
might be retriev'd: And ſuch is
the Harmony of Your Souls, ſo
ſtrong the Tie of Conjugal Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
as it cou'd ſcarce be greater,
when the whole World had but
<pb facs="tcp:60915:6"/>
Two in Family: An Example of
ſuch admirable Influence, that it
were able throughly to Convert a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Age, leſs lewd than <hi>That</hi> we
live in.</p>
            <p>But in vain, <hi>My Lord,</hi> I ſeek to
play the <hi>Panegyriſt,</hi> when Heaven
it ſelf has long ſince deſign'd You
for a laſting Ornament to this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by chuſing Your Lordſhip to
be a Part of thoſe precious Remains
of the <hi>Scoth Wreck:</hi> and his <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Highneſs</hi> has taught the World
how to value ſo much Worth and
Excellency, when Your Lordſhip
had the Honour to be the Second
Man call'd into the Long-Boat.</p>
            <p>As for theſe enſuing Trifles
Your Lordſhip may eaſily perceive
by the Weakneſs of the Child, that
the Parent is of no ſtrong Maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line

Conſtitution in <hi>Poetry:</hi> But if
the World will be pleas'd to take
'em as they are, I promiſe, for their
Comfort, never to trouble 'em
more. But why do I appeal to the
