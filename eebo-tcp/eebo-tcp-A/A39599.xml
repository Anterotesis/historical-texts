            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Thus you ſee what is the accurſed thing, <hi>viz.</hi> any thing finally ſeparated from man, and devoted to God; or ſecondly any thing deſtinated to utter aboliſhment by God: now to offend in this is done two waies, either by impropriation or appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
            <p>Firſt by impropriating from God what he hath eſpecially reſerved.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by appropriating to our ſelves any thing which he hath appointed to be fully deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Achan</hi> offended both waies, but for the firſt he impropriated from God the Wedge of Gold, which the Lord had peculiarly reſerved to himſelfe, chap. 6. v. 19. and ſecondly appropriated to himſelfe the Baby loniſh garment which God had appointed to be burnt and aboliſhed. chap. 6. verſe 18.</p>
            <p>Theſe things thus premiſed by way of explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I proceed to the confirmation to demonſtrate that thoſe in a Nation that offend in either of theſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93620:7"/>
waies in that which God hath execrated are the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by whom the Common-wealth is diſturbed; which would be moſt evident to thoſe that in the ſacred Chronicles of the Scripture, ſhall obſerve the Lords juſt proceeding againſt <hi>Achans,</hi> under what government ſoever they lived, whether Patriarchs, Judges, or Monarchs, in all which thoſe that did offend in that which God had execrated were the perſons, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Primo Adami</hi> there was a government inſtituted by God immediately, of univerſall peace, civil, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall, domeſticall, ſpirituall, corporall peace, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but peace, peace; yet <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> there, as <hi>Achan</hi> here, tooke but one bit of the excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thing, that God had ſpecially reſerved, and thereby became <hi>Achans,</hi> troublers of all the peace publicke, ſo that he made himſelfe and all the world <hi>anathema,</hi> an accurſed thing thereby. After, when peace begun to be reſtored, and religion repayred in the Familee of <hi>Seth,</hi> the ſonnes of God offended in the execrable thing in marrying the Daughters of excommunicate <hi>Caine,</hi> and ſo not onely diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, but brought ruine and deſtruction upon the whole World, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. v. 2, 7. When that great Law-giver <hi>Moſes,</hi> with Lawes judiciall, morall and alſo Ceremoniall, to tally divine, had ſetled the glory and peace of the Church, and Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the people offending in the accurſed thing of the Golden Calfe, ſo diſturbed all that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Law and Government alſo, they were like to be conſumed as one man and wholly extirpated, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. <hi>Saul</hi> was a Monarch annoynted of God himſelfe, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 15. elected by the vehement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of all the ſubjects, yet offending in the execrable
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93620:7"/>
thing of <hi>Agag,</hi> reſerving but one perſon which God had deſtinated to uter deſtruction, utterly ruinated his Government, and poſterity. <hi>Solomon</hi> the Prince of peace, that had a Patent of peace, 1. Kings. 11. 11. and ſuch skill in Governments as never any Monarch before him, or after him ſhall attaine, yet by offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the execrable thing of <hi>Chemoſh</hi> and <hi>Milcome</hi> diſturbed the peace publique, and made ſuch a rent in his Kingdome, as could never after be repaired.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Machiavill</hi> himſelfe in his Booke <hi>De Repub:</hi> gives us one ground for this, whilſt perſwading Kings, above all things, if they meane to maintaine obedience of their ſubjects to themſelves, and peace one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to poſſeſſe them with reverence of divine things, and feare of divine vengeance, as well as terror of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane penalty: for, ſaith he, whoſoever makes no ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to neglect or offend againſt theſe, will make much leſſe, when occaſion is offered, to plot ſedition, to accommodate themſelves to changes, to practice Treaſon, though to the utter overthrow of the whole Government. And ſurely he that is ſo looſe conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and deſperate, that he feares not with <hi>Achan</hi> to offend in the Babyloniſh Garment, though he doth thereby incurre, and expoſe himſelfe to the curſe of the King of Heaven, hath no banks, or bonds to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine him when occaſion is offered, to ruine others, to diſturbe and trouble Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and to turne Traytor to the beſt eſtabliſhed Government, or Governours on the Earth.</p>
            <p>But to leave the <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> ask <hi>Joſhua</hi> in the Text where thoſe that offend in the things that God hath execrated &amp;c. he tells you becauſe that by offending in things accurſed, they drive away the fountaine of all peace from it, even God the ſole Author and giver of all publicke peace, and tranquillity: ſo ſaith God himſelfe to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> v. 12. Except you take away
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93620:8"/>
the accurſed thing from among you, I will be with you no more: and woe unto any State when God departs from them, and will come no more at them in peace, but wrath. Which alſo every <hi>Achan</hi> offending in the execrable thing cauſeth God to doe, even to trouble the people with all adverſity, and bring forth his wrath againſt them, utterly to deſtroy them: ſo ſayth the text, verſe 1. of this Chapter, <hi>The anger of the Lord was kindled againſt Iſrael, becauſe Achan treſpaſſed in the abominable thing.</hi> Seeing therefore theſe <hi>Achans</hi> by their offending in this kind, drive away the Lord as a Friend, and bring him againſt the State as an Enemy, it muſt needs follow that ſuch are the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This leſſon God taught <hi>Joſhua,</hi> verſe the 12. and this leſſon <hi>Joſhua</hi> hath taught us in the words of the text, in calling <hi>Achan</hi> the troubler of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

            <p>By this lot then expreſly the Tridentine Papiſt, the Froggs and Locuſts of <hi>Rome,</hi> croaking over the Land are <hi>anathema</hi> accurſed things, troublers of our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as appeares by <hi>Pauls</hi> ſentence in expreſſe words againſt 1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. whilſt he affirmes, if either he or an Angell from Heaven, ſhould Preach any other do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine then Juſtification by grace, they were to be held an <hi>anathema,</hi> and accurſed things.

            <p>Firſt of all, doth not the impious prophanation of the Sabbath impropriate from God that which he hath ever reſerved to himſelfe, without any redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption by appropriating it to unneceſſary journeys, helliſh and laſcivious revellings, wicked ſports, and recreations? hath not God inhibited it peremptorily, above a hundred times in expreſſe Scripture? hath he not annexed a commination of publicke vengeance for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it, <hi>Amos,</hi> 8. even to ſet fire on the Gates of our chief City therefore? <hi>Jerem.</hi> 17. hath not this of late troubled moſt of the Lords Hoſts, made the hearts of the Elders melt like Water, ſlaughtered more then twice thirty ſixe, in reſpect of their livelyhood, and calling? who then can doubt that a prophaner of the Sabbath is an <hi>Achan</hi> and troubler of <hi>Iſrael?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, doth not the blaſphemous abuſer of Oathes impropriate from God and appropriate to common uſes, that which is more deere to God then all the Wedges of Gold in the World, I meane the due reverence to his name? hath he not peremptorily and univerſally forbidden it, Thou ſhalt not take my name in vaine, Above all things ſweare not? hath he not annexed a publicke commination, when he ſaith becauſe of Oaths the whole Land ſhall mourne, and if we feare not that glorious name he will make our Plagues wonderfull? <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. Did not <hi>Jonathan</hi> ſay truely of his owne Father <hi>Saul,</hi> that he had troubled the Land, by impoſ ng an unneceſſary Oath where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the hony was trodden under foot, the eyes of the people blinded, and the beſt of the Souldiers weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for want of it? Surely therefore the irreligious abuſer of Oathes, is an accurſed thing; which how lightly cenſured from men, ſhall be heavily puniſhed by God, even till the whole Land mourne for the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93620:10"/>
trouble it brings upon them, which muſt of neceſſity follow, that the toleration of that execrable ſwearing and Blaſphemy that wee heare belthed out in the the Streets as wee paſſe along in City and Country, in Court and Univerſity, muſt needs bee execrable things, and above all ſuch Oaths as are impoſed of purpoſe, and particular intentions, to enſnare and and bring into trouble, the moſt peacefull ſpirits of the Land; a blaſphemous abuſer of Gods name is an <hi>Achan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, doth not the Simoniacall, and irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous patron alſo offend, in the accurſed thing, both by impropriation and appropriation?</p>
            <p>Firſt, impropriating from Gods Temples, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, their power and liberty that God hath reſerved to them, in chooſing and conſenting to the choice of their ſpirituall guides?

            <p>I know what theſe patrons would retort againſt thee, ſoule-murthering and unconſcionable Pluraliſt and non-Reſident: what is it not as fit for a patron to impropriate a Wedge, as for the incumbent to impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate himſelfe from the people? are we greater <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chans</hi> for taking one or two yeares profit from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent, then he for taking all the reſt from the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate? may not a Patron preſent an unworthy Parſon, or Vicar, as well as the Parſon an inſufficient Curate? <hi>Quis tulerit Gracchos</hi> &amp;c. who is able to heare, much more to anſwer theſe tart obliquies againſt theſe Soule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murdering <hi>Prieſts</hi> as they call themſelves? for my part if I could I had rather hide, then uncover the naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our Fathers; but yet ſince wee are in inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for <hi>Achans,</hi> I dare not conceale them; onely as naked as I found them, ſo naked do I leave them, or at leaſt with nothing but a Babyloniſh Garment to cover them: even a Wedge of Gold, wrapped in a Babyloniſh Garment, is an unconſcionable non-reſident &amp; a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Having thus farre proceeded in diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of theſe five ſorts of <hi>Achans</hi> by this light of God his word, ſuffer me now to caſt the lot into the laps of the Honourable Houſe, and deliver the light to your judgments, further to diſcover more <hi>Achans</hi> by it, humbly deſiring your reſolution to theſe few quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, I ſhall from my text propound unto you.

               </label> The reaſon of this truth, upon which it is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, is the large and ſpreading nature of ſinne, unto others beſides thoſe that actually commit it: the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture demonſtrater this three waies by ſhewing how many may be guilty of the ſinne that one committs;</p>
            <p>Firſt acceſſarily, ſecondly occaſionally, thirdly poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, many may be guilty of the ſinne acted by one acceſſarily, when the actor is furthered in his ſinne, by the conſent, and privity of another, and that either <hi>à parte antè,</hi> or <hi>à parte poſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt <hi>antè</hi> three waies.</p>
            <p>Either by commanding it; ſo <hi>David</hi> killed <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> the <hi>Hittite,</hi> with the Sword of the Children of <hi>Ammon,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. becauſe he commanded <hi>Joab</hi> to ſet him in the fore-front:</p>
            <p>Secondly by counſelling; ſo the high Prieſts are ſaid with cruell hands to kill the Lord of glory, becauſe they counſelled the people to cry, <hi>crucifie him, crucifie him, Actes</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>Thirdly by provoking or inticing, and ſo <hi>Eve</hi> was in the tranſgreſſion and not <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe ſhe incited him thereto, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>Secondly <hi>à parte poſt,</hi> though he had no notice of it before; and that,</p>
            <p>Firſt, by conſenting after the fact is done, ſo <hi>Ahab</hi> is ſaid to kill <hi>Naboth,</hi> becauſe, after <hi>Ieſaball</hi> had done it without his knowledge, he conſented by taking poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his Eſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:93620:13"/>
Secondly, by defending it, ſo the <hi>Benjamites, Iudges</hi> 20. are guilty and puniſhed for the rape of <hi>Gibeah,</hi> though they knew not of it before, becauſe they defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them againſt the execution of juſtice, after it was committed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by conniving, and that either by not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving, if wee have place to doe it; ſo the Miniſter is guilty of his peoples fins, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. <hi>If thou reprove him not, his bloud will I require at thy hands;</hi> or not ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it, if no place of reproofe, ſo all the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were leavened, becauſe the Apoſtle tels them they ought to have ſorrowed, and did not; all theſe waies may a whole Nation be guilty of the ſinne of one man, and yet none of theſe waies was <hi>Iſrael</hi> guilty of <hi>Achans</hi> ſinne.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond kind of guilt is occaſionall guilt, which is, when the actor is furthered in his ſinne without our purpoſe, privity or conſent; as <hi>David</hi> was guilty of the Blaſphemy of Gods Enemies, occaſioned by his fall; <hi>Thou haſt given occaſion, ſaith God, to the enemies of God to Blaſpheme,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. This occaſionall guilt is either culpable, or inculpable: inculpable, when the ſinne of another riſeth from that which in it ſelfe is both mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially and formally good: ſo God deferring of ſentence againſt wicked ones, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8. is ſaid to be the cauſe of their going on in their ſinne, yet inculpable becauſe materially and formally good.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Culpable occaſionall guilt, is when ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is furthered in his ſinne, by that wich is materially or formally evill in us, which culpable guilt is either by not reſtraining, or furthering of it occaſionally.</p>
            <p>Firſt, wee are guilty occaſionally for not reſtraining ſinne, ſo <hi>Eli</hi> of his Sons ſinnes, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. becauſe they runne themſelves into a ſlander, <hi>and he reſtrained them not:</hi> and that,</p>
            <p>Firſt, when wee neglect to reſtraine it by Authority:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93620:13"/>
ſo when the people in <hi>Nebemiahs</hi> time bore burthens on the Sabbath, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſaith to the rulers, What thing is this that you doe in breaking the Sabbath in bearing burthens? becauſe they reſtrained not the porters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by neglecting of vigilancy in watching to keepe each other from it; and ſo I conceive all <hi>Iſrael</hi> was guilty of <hi>Achans</hi> finne, for not watching over him, and reſtraining him from the ſame; I know other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are given, but this ſeemes to be the beſt grounded from the text.</p>
            <p>Both becauſe God tells them before-hand chap. 6. verſe 18. that though all but one abſtained, yet if any one did offend he would puniſh them all for it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the precept is not only <hi>Cavete,</hi> take heed, but <hi>Cuſtodite,</hi> ſet a watch about others; which had they done, it had beene impoſſible, but ſome one in ſuch a company had diſcovered <hi>Achan</hi> in his theevery.</p>
            <p>And as a whole nation may be guilty of the ſinne of one man by not reſtraining it, ſo likewiſe by doing that which ſhall occaſionally further it, and that firſt by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; thus <hi>Peter</hi> is guilty of the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> conformity to the aboliſhed Ceremonies by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and is ſaid to conſtraine them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by giving opportunity to ſinne, as negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence makes theeves. <hi>Iudas</hi> is ſaid to purchaſe the field, <hi>Acts.</hi> 1. becauſe he threw downe the money, which gave occaſion to the <hi>Jewes</hi> to purchaſe it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by Imitation of men in their ſinnes; thus the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> in the 23. <hi>Matth.</hi> are ſaid to be guilty of all the bloud of the Prophets, that went before them, by imitating their malice; and exerciſing it againſt the Lord <hi>Ieſus,</hi> the head of Prophets, that then was with them.</p>
            <p>Theſe many waies way a whole Nation be guilty of the offence of one occaſionally; yet neither of theſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93620:14"/>
waies were the infants of <hi>Achans</hi> Familie guilty of the ſinne of <hi>Achan,</hi> and therefore the Scripture tells us of another guilt, which is a politicall guilt, meerly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and no waies active, not of the ſin at all, not puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eternall, but temporall, and externall, which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from the linkes and bonds, of politicke, and civill ſociety, whereby as members of the ſame body they are made partakers of the good, and evill belonging to either of them, in politicke things, as in the title which Lawyers call Franke pledges, wherein the Tenants are joyntly, and ſeverally bound to their Lord, and one to another, ſo that if one forfeit their eſtate, all forfeit with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even ſo in politicall guilt it comes to paſſe, as wee ſee in the death of Infants for their Parents, Subjects for Kings ſinne and tranſgreſſions. I know ſome goe about to vindicate Gods juſtice, by affirming that God found juſt matter in the moſt innocent, to juſtifie his rodde. Which though it be true, yet under correction, it ſuits not with the Scripture phraſe, for it ſaith, <hi>That the Famine in Davids time, was for Sauls bloudy houſe, not their owne ſinne:</hi> and therefore it is by politicall guilt; wherein yet the equity of Gods juſtice, and diſpenſation may be cleared from this, that as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent perſons, by vertue of politicall tyes and bonds, partake of many temporall rodds by occaſion of wicked mens ſinnes: ſo do they alſo receive many temporall commodities from their ſervices; the very Children of <hi>Achan,</hi> had formally received that life from him, which now they loſe by him.</p>

               <label type="milestone">

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Applic. </seg>3</label> Thirdly, let none then hereafter ſecure themſelves in perſonall innocency, or reſt in actuall purity, from the ſinnes of the times, he that is as pure as <hi>Ioſhua</hi> in perſon, may be guilty with <hi>Achan</hi> by relation; if God himſelfe therefore ſhould free thee from actuall guilt by his lot, reſt not untill by repentance, and execution of juſtice thou haſt freed thy ſelfe from occaſionall and acceſſary guilt alſo, otherwiſe he that cleeres thee from the act in thy ſelfe, will correct with deadly blowes for conniving and conſenting with others, let me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay with the Apoſtle to <hi>Titus</hi> 1. <hi>Be not partakers of others mens ſinnes.</hi> Alas then how vainly doe many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons bleſſe themſelves in caſting off the blame and danger of the ſinnes of the times upon great men in places, becauſe they thinke it is not their duties to reforme theſe things, but thoſe that have power and authority in their hands to ſuppreſſe them, which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they themſelves want, it belongs not to them to be grieved for them? but oh deceive not your ſelves
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93620:15"/>
herein, though God hath not given thee a hand to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe them, yet he hath given thee a heart to hate them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though God hath not given thee meanes or power to puniſh them, yet hath he given thee a tongue to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and pray againſt them; and for ſailing in theſe, thou maiſt be acceſſarily and occaſionally as guilty for thy part, as they in neglecting their power and place in their part.</p>
            <p>And how vainly doe many of our Magiſtrates with <hi>Pilate</hi> waſh their hands from the ſinnes of their divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in Townes and Families by ſaying, We have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe in theſe ſinnes of the times, we joyne not in the practice of drunkards, ſwearers, and inceſt, &amp;c. when yet they acceſſarily and occaſionally are guilty of all thoſe which by their counſell, power, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they might have reſtrained: the day will one day come, when all their inferiours under them ſhall lay the burthen of their ſinnes to their charge, when ſuch ſhall ſay as <hi>Caine,</hi> not onely my ſinnes are greater then I can beare, but my neighbours ſinnes, my people and Servants ſinnes, are greater then I can, and yet muſt beare them, God charges them upon mee; when they ſhall ſay as <hi>Ioſhua</hi> to <hi>Achan,</hi> thou <hi>Achan</hi> troubleſt us, ſo theſe, thou Idolater, Papiſt, ſwearer, uncleane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon troubleſt me, for I have beene acceſſary to your ſinnes, and muſt now anſwer for them. I knew once an Ale-houſe keeper taking notice of this truth, went home to his houſe, crying all the way he went, Oh if I muſt anſwer for all the ſinnes I have beene acceſſary unto, how many thouſand wicked and intemperate practiſes, oathes, lies, vaine words have I ſeen and heard in my houſe, by them that are now dead, and dyed in the guilt of thoſe ſinnes, which I occaſioned? what ſhall now become of mee? And leſt wee ſhould thinke it were his folly, or weakenes, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes it was a thing very hideous to him to thinke of

a Woman with whom in his yong time he had beene wanton, which after he thought dyed in her impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, and now, ſaith he, for ought I know, ſhee is in Hell-fire for that ſinne I drew her unto, and alſo blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemes God that I am not there with her. Oh may not the ſame thoughts be like burning coales in many a mans boſome? but I will ſpare you: onely for time to come, ſay to <hi>Achan</hi> wee have ſinnes enough of our owne to ſuffer for, wee will not beare your burthen, you ſhall not ſinne at our Soules coſt and charges, but if wee be innocent actually, we will alſo indeavour our ſelves to be ſo occaſionally and acceſſarily, ſo that no <hi>Achans</hi> offence may bring trouble upon us. And if you aske how this is to be done, what remedy wee are to uſe in this caſe, <hi>Ioſhua</hi> and the Lord tells you in the latter clauſe of the text, the ſentence and concluſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Achan, The Lord ſhall trouble you:</hi> And thus I ſlide from the Troubler, Trouble and troubled in the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, to the troubles and troubled in the concluſion, <hi>The Lord ſhall trouble thee;</hi> which remedy that it may be fully diſcerned what it is that is the Soule-cure of the troubles of a Common-wealth by <hi>Achans</hi> diſturbed, obſerve the matter out of which it muſt be wrought, <hi>the troubled;</hi> which is not only <hi>Achan</hi> alone, nor the Wedge and Babyloniſh Garment alone, in which he had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but <hi>Achan</hi> and all his appurtenances, that unto him belonged, his Children, his Cattell, to a hooſe, yea the very tent in which they and the Babyloniſh Garment were kept and hid, every thing in all the world that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to <hi>Achan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, obſerve <hi>the troubles,</hi> what muſt be done with them that <hi>Iſrael</hi> may be cured; not <hi>Achan</hi> to be impriſoned, or baniſhed alone, not to be fined for the Wedge and Babyloniſh Garment, his Horſes not to be curtald, ſeiſed and confiſcated, his houſe, and tent, to be removed and altered: but he and all his Followers

ſtoned, Tents, and Garments, and Wedge utterly to be conſumed, and burnt to aſhes, in a word all that he hath to be wholly extirpated, and annihilated.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, obſerve <hi>the troubler,</hi> the Author and actor that ordaines this cure; not paſſion or revenge in the people troubled, nor humane policy, whoſe equity and moderation might have beene queſtioned, but the Lord who is wiſdome, love, and goodnes himſelfe, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes it, yea and not onely preſcribes it, but alſo ownes the execution of it, <hi>The Lord ſhall trouble thee.</hi>

            <p>The rather I obſerve this note from the text, becauſe beſides the deſcription of God before opened, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant phraſe which the Spirit of God uſeth in ſetting downe the remedy doth ſtrongly perſwade it was principally intended, while the name of the offender, and the name of the offence, and the name of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and the name of the place of the execution, is expreſt by the ſame <hi>Radix</hi> in Hebrew

            <p>Firſt for the preſcription, ſecondly the practice.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the preſcription of God is not onely evident here, but in all other of the like nature, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. the execrable thing of the golden Calfe troubled the whole Church ſo farre that for it the Tables are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the people abhorred, God departed, the whole congregation except <hi>Moſes</hi> to be totally conſumed: how is this to be remedied? <hi>Moſes</hi> fell on his face there, as <hi>Joſhua</hi> here, and makes God cry out <hi>Let me alone, &amp;c.</hi> will this cure it? is this all? no. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeeth for all Prayers <hi>Iſrael</hi> will not be cured, though ſpared, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a full, and totall extirpation of all the accurſed things and perſons alſo.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the accurſed thing the Calfe muſt be aboliſhed, ſtampt, ground to powder, burnt to aſhes and drunke, there is the totall extirpation of the thing; and verſe 25. God ſaith by <hi>Moſes</hi> his mouth, that had prayed for them, Goethrough all the Campe from Tent to Tent, and Gate to Gate, and ſlay every man his Neighbour, Friend, Brother and Sonne, that the Lord may beſtow his bleſſing upon you, as if no bleſſing without a full extirpation of perſons, as well as things, verſe 26. 30. The like is ſeene in the courſe of that great trouble which was brought upon the Church by the accurſed things of <hi>Baal Peor,</hi> for which wrath came upon the whole congregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for beſides the zeale of <hi>Phineas</hi> in ſtaying and mitigating the wrath of God by the ſpeedy cutting off of two principall offenders,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93620:17"/>
the Lord to ſhew that a perfect cure could not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a totall extirpation, preſcribes it for this end to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and all the Iudges in their circuits, and diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Moſes</hi> (ſaith the Lord) hang up every head of the people that were joyned to <hi>Baal Pecor</hi> that the wrath of God may be turned away, and then that all the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and people may ſlay every man that had defiled themſelves in the execrable things, <hi>Num.</hi> 25. 5. And this totall extirpation to be divine preſcription to ſettle &amp; eſtabliſh a Common-wealth diſtempered in peace and tranquillitie, is moſt evident in the frequent injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and inculcation of it to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they came into <hi>Canaan,</hi> to aboliſh and put downe all accurſed things and perſons from under Heaven, and by their terrible ruins for their partiall extirpation of them.</p>
            <p>Neither is this preſcription more divine, then the practice in this particular, witnes the immediate pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of God himſelfe, in repairing the ruined Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Common-wealth of the old world, by taking away the execrable things and perſons that then over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw it; what was done? God brings an univerſall deluge, totall confuſion and extirpation of them all, as if God himſelfe could doe it by no other meanes but this. Sutable to which is that declaration of his, in the whole booke of the Prophets, and the explication of them in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> where the Lord ſetting downe, and foretelling the reparation and reſtauration of the Church upon earth againe, like new Heavens and new Earth where righteouſneſſe ſhould dwell, and be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from old troubles and abominations, ſhewes it ſhall be brought to paſſe by the full extirpation of all exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable perſons and things, Beaſts, falſe Prophets, Thrones of the Beaſts, Froggs, and Locuſts, name of the Beaſt, and the number of his name.
