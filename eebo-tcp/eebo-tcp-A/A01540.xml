            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p> I haue perused your <hi>Answer</hi> to <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

               <pb facs="tcp:3067:3"/>
that he was euen constrained, according to the manner of some old <hi>Roman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Orators</hi> noted by <hi>Quintilian, Caussarum vacua con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitijs implere.</hi> Neither the <hi>matter</hi> in hand, about which learned <hi>Protestants</hi> may differ in iudgement without breach of <hi>Charity,</hi> or preiudice to Christian <hi>vnity,</hi> nor your hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it <hi>dog matically</hi> and <hi>scholastically</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>gall</hi> at all, could occasion such <hi>heats.</hi> I cannot imagine therefore, what should so much moue him, but the badnesse of his <hi>cause,</hi> and the weaknesse of his owne <hi>Arguments,</hi> which he seeth by your handling them to be like <hi>wier-strings</hi> ill-nealed, which would not endure the least straining. For albeit I confesse that we are all apt to take too much hold of any point of liberty reached vnto vs out of Gods word; and in particular I cannot but deplore <hi>sortem sortis, the Lot of Lot</hi> it selfe, which hath beene and is too much by the licentious abused, and thereby in a sort defamed, especially in <hi>Carding</hi> and <hi>Dicing:</hi> yet <hi>Gods truth</hi> must not be suppressed because of <hi>mans errors;</hi> neither is it a safe way to goe about to cure an error in <hi>practise,</hi> by another error in <hi>iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3067:3"/>
I meane, to reforme the <hi>abuse</hi> in <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorie Lots</hi> by totally condemning the <hi>vse</hi> it selfe of them. Though a <hi>Surgean</hi> meane neuer so well in letting his Patient bloud who needeth it, yet if he strike not the right veine, he had better haue spared his paines. The sinne too regnant in <hi>sports</hi> and <hi>games</hi> now a-daies is not in vsing the <hi>Lot,</hi> but in not obseruing those <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Cautions</hi> in these and other <hi>Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations,</hi> which are iudiciously and piously set downe by you in your compleat <hi>Treatise of Lots.</hi> Let those <hi>Cautions</hi> be obserued, and set aside the authoritie of some <hi>Diuines,</hi> whose <hi>persons</hi> they haue in admiration aboue others; what is there in the casuall falling of <hi>the Dye,</hi> or dealing of <hi>the Cards,</hi> more than in the fall of <hi>a Coyte,</hi> or lighting of <hi>an Arrow</hi> neerer or further, or the turning of <hi>a Boule,</hi> to ensnare the Conscience? <hi>Art</hi> more ruleth the one, and <hi>Nature</hi> the other; <hi>Gods prouidence</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence being equall in either. For to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that because <hi>some Lots</hi> haue beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated to <hi>an holy vse</hi> sometimes, therefore <hi>all Lots</hi> are <hi>sacred,</hi> is a feeble kinde of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing. And to impose <hi>a speciall and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3067:4"/>
               <hi>worke of Gods prouidence,</hi> vpon the casuall euent of the <hi>Lot,</hi> more than vpon other naturall accidents and deliberate actions of men, is a temerarious and groundlesse assertion. And furthermore to charge all those <hi>seruants of God,</hi> who moderately vse their <hi>Christian liberty</hi> in these <hi>Games,</hi> with so hainous a sinne, as is <hi>the prophaning of a thing sacred,</hi> or <hi>taking in vaine Gods deciding Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> is an vncharitable censure. The Lord open the eyes of all that seeke to serue him in sinceritie and singlenesse of heart, that neither by enlarging their <hi>Christian liberty</hi> they open a gap to <hi>licentiousnesse,</hi> nor yet by too much restraining it lay a snare on <hi>weake Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> To deliuer you my iudgement and aduice in a word; <hi>Satis actum est:</hi> you haue sifted this point of <hi>Lots</hi> to the bran. Let me aduise you hereafter <hi>non reciprocare serram con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionis de ludis sortiarijs,</hi> but rather to imploy your able pen against the <hi>Sorcerers</hi> of <hi>Aegypt</hi> now abounding in euery place, and making aduantages of the least differences among vs, who hold the like pretious faith pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the drosse of their superstition.

                  <hi>Grounds</hi> likewise, but those suggested to him from others, as the former were from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
               <p>1. Because he <hi>onely liueth of all those whom Mr. G. refuteth.</hi> Where in the <hi>Catalogue</hi> of those whom he saith I refute, he reckoneth some, as <hi>Zwinglius,</hi> whom I refute not at all, as not knowing certainly what they held, some that himselfe refuteth as well as I doe, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Cards</hi> and <hi>Tables</hi> as not simply vnlawfull, as <hi>Peter Martyr, Danaeus,</hi> and <hi>Perkins;</hi> that so both I might seeme vtterly to dissent from them concerning the lawfulnes of those <hi>Games,</hi> whereas <note n="c" place="margin">Mr. G. main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth no more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning Cards and Tables, than <hi>Peter Martyr, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi> and <hi>Perkins</hi> doe.</note> I maintaine no more concerning the lawfulnesse of them in themselues than they doe, (though in our <hi>grounds,</hi> I confesse, wee differ) and that himselfe might seeme, as the last man aliue amongst them, to stand vp in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of them, when as indeed he opposeth and impugneth them, and these <hi>Games,</hi> by them not vtterly disallowed.</p>

               <p>But to leaue that, in their iudgement concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning such <hi>Games,</hi> there is the more seeming dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference among <hi>Diuines</hi> and others, because <note n="a" place="margin">See my booke of <hi>Lots. ch. 6. sect. 3. p. 126.</hi>

               <p>Whereas therefore the <hi>Games</hi> controuerted are of two sorts, some depending wholly vpon <hi>Casualty,</hi> and some but in part onely; <note n="b" place="margin">Fennor <hi>of</hi> recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at. cap. 4.

B. <hi>wrong, and that I should therefore giue him satisfaction in priuate, but that</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B. <hi>would not therewith be satisfied, but would haue it done in publike, since the wrong was such; and that the same Reuerend Doctor should say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if my Treatise of Lots were againe to be licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, he would not haue licenced it:</hi> (all which was vtterly vntrue) and supposing that this could come from none but M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> B. denying both to be the Author of the report, and the truth of the things reported; for that I there rested.

that they would be pleased at my request to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it for the Presse. Which why they refused to doe, is needlesse here to relate. I told him fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that I was informed of two things in it; the one, that I was accused therein <hi>to haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed him in the Pulpit by name;</hi> the other, (which much more neerely touched me) that I was charged <hi>to maintaine in that my Treatise some Assertions that were blasphemous.</hi> The former he affirmed that he had heard by many.

How I na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him or his Booke rather, and so him with it, I told him: to wit, that hauing propounded the <hi>Question</hi> concerning the <hi>light vse of a Lot,</hi> I recited those <hi>Authors</hi> that had written of this <hi>Subiect,</hi> viz. <hi>B.

vnto him, that if he would doe but as much for me, as I had before done for him, (and I suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in way of requitall I might haue required it) to deliuer me his <hi>Discourse</hi> or <hi>a Copie</hi> of it, I would vndertake within short time either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne it with due answer, or to make publike acknowledgment of mine error, if I were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by conuinced thereof.

such a duty, to shew me mine error, that I might not continue in so foule and dangerous an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; or to referre it to any one or more of our <hi>Reuerend Brethren of the Ministery</hi> about the <hi>City,</hi> such as himselfe should make choise of, whether that which I required of him were equall and reasonable, and whether he in <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie</hi> might refuse it.

                        <p>Therefore a Lot may more lawfully be vsed about weighty affaires, than about affaires of lesse weight.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>For the Antecedent, I might well question one branch of it concerning <hi>the diuision of the Land of Promise by Lot,</hi> of which also I haue spoken <note n="d" place="margin">Of Lots, Chap. 4. Sect. 10. pag. 67, 68.</note> else-where at large, and to auoid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixitie referre thither my Reader. Onely thus much for the present. Whether that <hi>Lot</hi> were <hi>ordinarie</hi> and now imitable or no, may be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned. If it were done with respect to a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer prophecie, and with expectation that the seats of the seuerall <hi>Tribes</hi> should by vertue of the <hi>Lot</hi> fall out answerably thereunto, it was <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie,</hi> and not imitable now of any with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the like speciall ground. If it were done onely to determine which share each <hi>Tribe</hi> should haue of the <hi>Land</hi> as equally as could be diuided; though the businesse it selfe, to wit, the diuiding of the Land was weighty, yet that which the Lot was to doe in this businesse was it selfe of no great weight; for it was not much materiall which part <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that Tribe</hi> had, when little difference was betweene part and part; yea the lesse difference there was, the lesse inequalitie there could be; the lesse ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie there could be, the lesse weighty it was
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:3067:44"/>
how the Lot went; againe, the lesse danger of inequalitie, the lawfuller the Lot, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the lesse weighty the euent, the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler still the Lot. So that this instance either is of the same stampe with the other three, and must receiue then the same answer with them; or if it be of another kinde, yet it confirmeth not the consequent, because neither was that of much weight that the Lot was to doe therein, nor will it follow, <hi>A Lot was vsed once</hi> (yea say more than once) <hi>in a weighty affaire; therefore a Lot may more lawfully be vsed about weighty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, than it may about those that are of lesse weight.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This premised for that branch of the <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent;</hi> I denie now M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. not <hi>Consequent,</hi> but <hi>Consequence.</hi> And that for two causes: 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause though it were granted that the <hi>instances</hi> were to purpose, yet the <hi>Consequent</hi> will not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily flow from thence; <hi>In such three cases and vpon such occasions a Lot was vsed in weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie affaires: therefore a Lot may more lawfully,</hi> &amp;c. as before. All that will follow; all granted that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B. himselfe requireth; is but this, <hi>Therefore in weighty affaires sometimes a Lot is not vnlawfull;</hi> or (for I had almost forgotten my selfe) <hi>the vse of a Lot is lawfull.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Because the <hi>instances</hi> are nothing to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, being of such <hi>Lots</hi> as were <hi>extraordinarie,</hi> and are not now imitable, as may appeare by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. owne grants in the very next words to these. The <hi>Question</hi> is about <hi>the lawfull vse</hi>

                        <hi>of a Lot,</hi> that is, how and wherein we may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully vse Lots, &amp; <hi>whether in such Lots as we may now lawfully vse, the lesse weighty the matter be, the lawfuller the Lot is.</hi> Now to disproue mine <hi>Affirmatiue</hi> herein, or to proue the contrary thereunto, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B. produceth <hi>three Instances</hi> of <hi>Lots</hi> vsed in such cases, as none lawfully now may vse them in; in some whereof indeed, had not the Lot by an <hi>extraordinarie prouidence</hi> bin certainly directed, the euent was in hazard to haue beene of foule and fearefull consequence, either some innocent condemned, or some vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit person designed to a place of the highest mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                     <p>That <hi>I say there is no Lot, where no Controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie is,</hi> is vntrue. I say onely, <hi>Where no question or Controuersie is.</hi> For <hi>a question</hi> may be where <hi>a Controuersie</hi> is not. Since that <hi>a Controuersie</hi> is properly <note n="c" place="margin">Controversia, quando de re qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piam controverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, vel lis aliqua instituitur.</note> 
                        <hi>a Question betweene two parties contending;</hi> and <hi>a Question</hi> therefore more large than it. But vnlesse some such controuersie be about the matter of indifferencie to be done or not done, <hi>my former fore-peece,</hi> saith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B. <hi>it not true.</hi> If it be then, belike it is. What M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B. would say, I know not. What he doth say is this: <hi>To put a matter of indifferencie so to the</hi>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:3067:48"/>
                        <hi>hazard of an vncertaine euent, in a matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie is lawfull.</hi> But, <hi>To put it to hazard so out of matter of controuersie, it is not lawfull.</hi> The reason hee giueth why it is lawfull in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, is because <hi>there is some necessitie then of ending the controuersie put to the determination of a Lot, and consequently it is not then meerely in the will of man whether he shall doe it, or not doe it.</hi> Where 1. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B. is too busie with <hi>a Lot,</hi> when it is not at all in the <hi>Proposition.</hi> 2. He presumeth that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer any <hi>Controuersie</hi> is, there cannot be but by <hi>Lot</hi> a determining of it. Which is so vntrue, as that the contrary rather is most true, that nothing may be decided by <hi>Lot,</hi> but that that may by other meanes also be decided. 3. Hee misinterpreteth my words when I say <hi>of a thing that may be done,</hi> as if they were meant of putting or not putting the matter in question to the hazardous euent, whereas my words are plaine of the doing or not doing the thing it selfe, which for the doing or not doing is referred to that hazard. But if in any case it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that no way hurteth me.</p>
                     <p>The reason he rendreth why it is vnlawfull in the latter is, <hi>because such a matter vnlesse it be controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, cannot be the subiect matter of a Lot;</hi> which we haue nothing yet to doe withall. And the words therefore, as they are vntrue, nor doe I any where so say, so they are altogether impertinent to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Proposition.</hi> Here is M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. <hi>Argument: There can be no Lot where no Controuersie is. Therefore to put the question concerning a matter of indifferencie to the hazard of some casuall euent whether it shall be</hi>

                        <hi>done or not done, vnlesse some controuersie be about it, is vnlawfull.</hi> Both the <hi>Antecedent</hi> is vntrue; and the <hi>Consequence</hi> vnsound. He might better haue said, <hi>Where no Controuersie is, no Lot can be: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> (supposing that to be true) <hi>it is not possible for any man to put such a question to a Lot or to such a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall euent, as there is no Controuersie of.</hi> For it is fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous for one to say, <hi>it is not lawfull for a man to doe that, which</hi> by his owne grounds and grants <hi>is impossible.</hi>

though there be oft, is not by me here que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned, nor doth the strength of mine <hi>Argument</hi> depend thereupon.

                     <p>Albeit it be sufficient to carry my Cause, that the <hi>lightnesse of the matters questioned be no plea sufficient against the vse of a Lot;</hi> neither is it at all <hi>pressed here in the latter shape,</hi> as he termeth it: yet true it is that I affirme <hi>the lightest matters to sort best with the nature of it, and that it is not fit to be vsed in any weighty affaire;</hi> to wit, where it is a matter of weight and much consequence whether it fall this or that way. Which neither say I alone, as my <hi>margine</hi> may there shew; nor doe I nakedly affirme it, but adde something to strengthen it: And M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B. though he haue oft againe and againe carp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>d at it, yet neither offreth he to refute it, nor ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth notice of the backing of it, but posteth it off still to a further place. Yea I affirme now further, what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B. in part hereupon inferreth, to wit, that <hi>the weightinesse of the businesse,</hi> in regard of the euent, <hi>maketh Lotterie the lesse lawfull,</hi> nor to be condescended vnto without very great necessitie, and to be vsed with far much more care and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than were otherwise needfull in it. And I say therefore <hi>the lesse lawfull</hi> in such case, because there must needs be a fault either in the party so vsing it, or in those that vrge the vse of it, when in such case
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:3067:50"/>
it is condescended vnto. The reason is euident. For if the matter to be decided by <hi>Lot</hi> be weighty in regard of the euent of it, then must it needs be of great moment which way the Lot falleth. If it be of great moment which way the Lot falleth, then as it may proue well if it fall the one way, so it must needs produce much inconuenience if it fall out the other way, and the more inconuenience, the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier the thing is in regard of the euent. If it must needs then produce such inconuenience if it doe fall that way, then to put it to the hazard of falling that way, is to put the matter vpon hazard of such inconuenience. But to put the matter vpon the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of a Lot, is to put it vpon hazard of falling that way, since that the Lot may fall out either way, for ought they know that make vse of it, or else it is no Lot; and therefore to put such weighty matter to the decision of a Lot, is to put it vpon ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of much inconuenience.

                        <hi>it selfe, may lawfully be put to the decision of a Lot,</hi> whether it shall be done or no. If he dare not iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the putting of either to the decision of a Lot, he must needs grant that <hi>indifferencie</hi> (which here he sticketh so much at) is <hi>a necessarie affection</hi> of such things as may lawfully be put thereunto. But of this at large <note n="h" place="margin">Of Lots, Chap. 5. Sect. 5.</note> in my first <hi>Caution;</hi> which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

                     <p>For <hi>Necessitie,</hi> it is true, nor doe I denie it, but that it may make some <hi>Lotteries</hi> lawfull to some, that for them otherwise to condescend vnto were vtterly vnlawfull. As necessitie to preuent a greater mischiefe, may make a man yeeld to giue his purse to a theefe, <note n="i" place="margin">Act. 27. 18, 19, 38. -Solet decidere ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctu Navita cum ventis; imitatus Castora, qui se Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchum ipse sacit, cupiens evadere damno.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:3067:52"/>
what no wise man will anow. And yet to charge a lusorious Lot with Impietie, hath as little ground as the other.</p>
                  <p>For the manifesting hereof let thus much be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, that all Impietie may be referred to these <note n="h" place="margin">Ezek. 22. 4. 26.</note> two heads, either the prophaning of hallowed things, or the hallowing of things prophane: since it cannot be imagined how any Impiety should be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted but either by denying holy things their due respect, or by giuing the same where it is not due. But lusorious Lots are not of themselues guilty in either of these kindes. In the latter kinde euen their greatest aduersaries will cleare them, there being no colour to charge them with the hallowing of ought that is not otherwise holy. And in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer kinde they may be cleared also by the grounds of Gods Law, to wit, from the prophaning of ought that is holy. For the thing vsed in them is a Lot: and nothing can be prophaned by them but what is vsed in them: (by Lots, I meane simply as they are Lots, for to make Lots of holy things, as of parcels of Scripture, or of the Elements conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate in the Sacrament, &amp;c. is not any thing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the nature of a Lot, but an abuse cleauing to it in some particular mens practise of it, and such as is to be seuered therefore in this our discourse from it.) But a Lot is no holy thing, either of it selfe and in it owne nature, or by vertue of any diuine institution. For of these two sorts are all holy things whatsoeuer, either they are holy of themselues and in their owne nature, as <note n="i" place="margin">Iosh. 24. 19. Esai. 6. 3.

                     <p>But to speake a little more (generally) of things not indifferent, because forbidden; I say, That is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den as well which is forbidden by iust consequence, as that which is expresly forbidden: As that is permitted as well which is permitted by iust consequence, as that which is expresly permitted. <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G.</hi> affirmeth the latter, p. 137. and will not (I dare say) denie the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Againe, The word of God is so perfect, that whatsoeuer it neither commandeth, nor permitteth expresly or by iust consequence, that is verily forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. For all things, especially such as haue relation to God, ought to haue some warrant from the word. If <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G.</hi> put me to proue this, I dare vndertake to proue it demonstratiuely. But I presume he will not. For in the last mentioned page, he describeth that to be indifferent, which is <hi>(at least)</hi> permitted by the word. If a thing be not so much as permitted, it cannot be lawfull, and therefore not indifferent. Here I wish he would remember what he writeth, pag. 95. speaking of this word <hi>[Indifferent]</hi> as it is opposed to good or euill, and she wing how some say that to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, which is neither good nor euill, he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the point thus. <hi>Neuerthelesse most true it is, That no particular morall action, or, No action of the reasonable Creature proceeding from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, can possibly be so indifferent, but it must of necessitie be either conformable to the Rules of Gods holy word, or disconformable thereunto.</hi> So that I wonder why <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

                  <p>This would the rather be obserued for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier answering of some friuolous obiections made by some Separatists; <hi>What warrant,</hi> say they, <hi>haue you to vse this or that forme of prayer, or to pray vpon a booke?</hi> I answer; It is warrant sufficient that <note n="r" place="margin">Luk. 18. 1. 1 Thess. 5. 17. 1 Tim. 2. 1. 8.</note> we are inioyned to vse praier, and <note n="s" place="margin">Matth. 6. 9, 12. Act. 8. 22. 1 Ioh. 1. 9.</note> such kinde of praier, confession of sin, and supplication for pardon, &amp;c. no set forme thereof determined; therefore any fit forme warrantable: this forme that we vse, not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit otherwise; this forme therefore allowable. And let a man demand of one of them when he praieth, what warrant he hath to vse that forme that he then vseth, he can answer no otherwise; or if in effect
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:3067:64"/>
otherwise, he shall answer otherwise than well. So for a booke; the meanes of helpe are not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and this one among others; this therefore not vnwarrantable. And if one of them should be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, how he proueth it warrantable to vse a printed booke to reade on in the Church; he shall not be able to make other answer than as before: for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther precept nor practise can be found in the word for the vse of a thing that was not knowne in those times wherein the word of God was written.</p>
                  <p>But to apply this to the present. First, <note n="t" place="margin">Eccles. 3. 4.

                  <p>Secondly, for the matter and manner of it, or the things wherewith we may recreate our selues, <note n="u" place="margin">Certum est in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinis literis nullam de ludis aut regula<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aut formam prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribi: quamvis in eis multa ludorum genera leguntur.

                     <p>Why I insert those words into mine <hi>Assertion,</hi> may easily appeare to any that will not wilfully shut his eyes: because my dispute is concerning <hi>Recreation,</hi> a thing granted to be such, and the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi> onely about the <hi>subiect matter</hi> of it. And so far are my words from implying any such matter, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

                     <p>But I maruell much more at this ground, Such things are lawfull as the word doth not forbid. I set it downe thus, because the confirmations tend to make this good, and so conclude. All things not prohibited are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: and therefore the subiect matter &amp;c. of a thing lawfull in it selfe. I maruell, I say, because <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G.</hi> confirmeth a thing or act it selfe to be lawfull in it selfe, if it be in the word, either commanded, or permitted expresly, or by iust consequence. Which I acknowledge to be so cleare a truth, that (me thinks) <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G.</hi> cannot, but in proportion of reason, if he beleeue the word to be <note n="i" place="margin">Psal. 19. 7.</note> perfect <note n="k" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 15, 16, 17.</note> vnto euery good worke, hold all things

to be vnlawfull, which are not lawfull one of these two waies; and the rather because he peremptorily affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, p. 95.

O that <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G.</hi> would hold to this doctrine! Then should he thereby prouoke all who make conscience of their waies, and <note n="l" place="margin">Iohn 3. 21.</note> doe truth (that is, doe good works sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) to come to the light, that their deeds might be made manifest, that they are wrought according to God.

For, saith he, the word is giuen vs, in morall matters to supplie the defect of naturall reason caused by our first parents their fall. Is it our best way then to seeke sufficient direction in morall matters from naturall reason, before wee consult with God in his word? For the said direction is two times vrged thus. I say, where naturall reason doth not of it selfe afford sufficient direction. And need not a man know, that he hath warrant from Gods word, if in his perswasion he haue sufficient direction from naturall reason? Doth the Maxime of Gods Spirit, quoted here by <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G.</hi> to wit, [What is not of faith is sinne,] intimate, that<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 23.</note> whatsoeuer is done by sufficient direction from natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reason is of faith?

For at last he commeth to say: Neither doth the word abridge vs of the helpe and vse of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Reason for direction in such actions. Here is some more authoritie (to wit, Of not abridging vs of the helpe, &amp;c.) giuen to the word. For it doth imply, that the word might abridge vs, &amp;c. Therefore our most warrantable way is to be well informed, when and how far the word doth giue vs leaue to vse the direction of naturall reason in morall matters. If this be so, then the former strange doctrine is contradicted, and I need not make any answer to the Scriptures quoted in the Margent.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>strange and fearefull Position,</hi> as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth it, is this: <hi>Neither the doing of any Act, nor the manner of doing needeth warrant from the word, if naturall Reason of it selfe afford sufficient directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Its this, as I deliuer it my selfe; <hi>For the doing of euery act, and the doing of it in this or that manner, if naturall reason will not of it selfe afford sufficient direction, there must be warrant had out of Gods word.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the difference betweene these two be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; I answer:</p>
                     <p>First, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Bs. <hi>Proposition</hi> may seeme to imply, that in any <hi>Act whatsoeuer sufficient direction may</hi>

                        <hi>by naturall Reason be afforded,</hi> (which I say not:) in mine onely, that in some kinde and some cases there may. In the former manner (it seemeth) M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B. pleased to propound it, to procure the greater preiudice to that that I hold.</p>
                     <p>Againe, (wherein the most materiall difference consisteth) it is one thing for an action to haue <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from Gods word,</hi> (which I denie not but that euery action ought to haue) and another thing to haue that <hi>warrant</hi> taken immediatly <hi>out of it;</hi> as shall afterward appeare. So that neither doth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B. here faithfully relate what I say, nor doe I affirme what he here relareth.</p>
                     <p>Yet for the point, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B. here propoundeth it, sauing what he would seeme to imply in it, and burden me and my cause with the enuie of; the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi> it selfe containeth such an vndeniable truth, as there is no man, I suppose, endued with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense, but will acknowledge it. For <hi>if Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Reason of it selfe afford sufficient direction, there need no further warrant from ought else;</hi> since that it were not sufficient yet, if it needed ought else. And it was euen so with <hi>Adam</hi> in his originall estate. If any truth vndeniable then be fearfull and strange then this <hi>position</hi> peraduenture may be such; but not else.</p>
                     <p>But for the point as I propound it; (for with that now I deale not) that <hi>for the doing of euery act, and the doing of it thus or thus, if naturall reason will not of it selfe afford sufficient direction, there must be warrant had out of Gods word.</hi> If the question be demanded, why I speake in this manner, I answer,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:3067:76"/>
because many things in this kinde are so cleare and euident euen to naturall reason, that there can no doubt be made of them, or that they may vnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerably and necessarily be thereby concluded; for which therefore <hi>a man need not further war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant out of the word;</hi> not that <hi>the warrant of Gods word</hi> is in any wise needlesse; but that a man may thereby be well assured, that it hath <hi>warrant in Gods word.</hi> For what is <hi>the word of God</hi> for <hi>morall things,</hi> but <hi>the perfection of true Reason,</hi> and <hi>a Summe</hi> or <hi>Body of that Law of Nature</hi> at first imprinted in <hi>mans soule?</hi> So that either it must be held that there are some things in the <hi>Law of God not agreeable to Reason;</hi> or else it must needs follow, that <note n="x" place="margin">Gratia non de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struit naturam, sed eam perficit.

obserued, that in this large Argument, it cannot be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered what <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G.</hi> meaneth by Subiect Matter. So the mind of the Reader may be troubled with words, which <note place="margin">Acts 15. 24.</note> ought not to be. But by that which he writeth, p. 230. I vnderstand, hee meaneth the matter whereabout the Lottery is imployed. If so, I affirme that the subiect matter of a Lot is determined by God, namely, A contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie to be ended thereby: and therefore I also affirme, lusorious businesse (to vse <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G<hi rend="sup">s</hi>.</hi> owne word, p. 130.) to be a subiect matter of a Lot, no lesse against the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Rules of the Word, than was the finding out of Ionas in <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G<hi rend="sup">s</hi>.</hi> iudgement, p. 278. If then a lusorious Lot be not a thing lawfull in it selfe, and if Lusorious busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes be a subiect matter of a Lot, that is against the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Rules, then how can the manner and other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, though neither determined, nor forbidden, be sufficient warrant for the vse of a lusorious Lot.</p>

                     <p>Not to say, how fitly the place of <hi>Scripture</hi> in the <hi>Margine</hi> is here applied. For <hi>the simple Reader,</hi> if a man should stand to explaine euery <hi>Schoole terme,</hi> that, in such discourses and disputes as this, we are inforced oft to vse, it would be a very tedious taske both to Writer and Reader.

should not vnderstand what himselfe saith.

                     <p>For the thing it selfe: First, it is well knowne, that for many <hi>Heads,</hi> or <hi>Common places,</hi> what is found in the word may soone be laid all together, as for <hi>games,</hi> for <hi>markets,</hi> for <hi>mariage-feasts,</hi> for <hi>Lots,</hi> and the like: by consideration whereof a man may oft be informed what is in <hi>Gods word</hi> either for or against them.

[The vse of things is to be limited according to the generall rules.] For these rules require <hi>Decency, Expediency,</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> and therefore they are not obeyed by the vse of things not <hi>vndecent,</hi> not <hi>inexpedient,</hi> and not <hi>impious.</hi> For it is to be noted, that in 1 Cor. 6. 12. &amp; 10. 23.

                  <p>The proofe annexed to it scarce carrieth good sense: the Printer, it may be, is in fault. But if the meaning of the Author be, as I conceiue it, (for I must in part goe by guesse) that <hi>the disposition of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Lot is wholly attributed to, and the euent wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the speciall and immediate Prouidence of God;</hi> I denie it, neither doe the places produced proue it.

                  <p>The <note n="g" place="margin">Act. 1. 24, 26.</note> latter is an example of an extraordinary Lot, wherein there was indeed an immediate and speciall prouidence.

For in an ordinary, as well as an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Lot, the things are by man of purpose intentionally disposed vnto a variable euent, and they are wholly disposed by God vnto this or vnto that euent, which the vser of a Lot expecteth. If so, then it followeth, that the vse of all Lots (as they be Lots) whether ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie or extraordinarie, directly or of it selfe, and in speciall manner, tendeth to the aduancing of the name of God. How? The vse of Lots attributeth to Gods speciall prouidence in the whole and immediate dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Lot, and in expecting the euent.

                        <hi>it is the variable euent of some sensible thing applied to the determining of some doubtfull matter.</hi> But because that will not here serue his turne, he changeth his note now, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this the <hi>generall nature of a Lot common to all Lots,</hi> (begging withall pitifully that that is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie) <hi>that things be by man of purpose intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally disposed vnto a variable euent, and wholly dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by God vnto this or that euent, which the vser of a Lot expecteth.</hi> That which is so far from being the <hi>common nature of a Lot,</hi> that neither the one branch, nor the other is <hi>common to all Lots,</hi> much lesse both iointly together. For neither is it true, that <hi>in euery Lot things are by man disposed to a variable euent:</hi> as where a controuersie is put to be decided by the track and turning of some beast that hath passed before: nor are <hi>the things by man disposed in Lot, by God euer wholly and immediatly disposed,</hi> as in <hi>the proofe of his Assumption</hi> is affirmed, and here onely repeated; and much lesse are they euer <hi>disposed to such euent, as by the vsers of the Lot is expected,</hi> but rather cleane contrary sometime, as in <note n="e" place="margin">Ester 3. 7, 13.</note> 
                        <hi>Hamans</hi> example. But <hi>if it be so in all Lots,</hi> saith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

                        <hi>not at all proue it; then mine Assumption standeth firme; to wit, that a Lot doth directly or of it selfe and in speciall manner tend to the aduancing of the name of God, in attributing to his speciall prouidence in the whole and immediate disposing of the Lot, and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the euent.</hi> Which by the way he demandeth, <hi>whether it scarce carry good sense or no:</hi> because I said <hi>it scarce did,</hi> being withall willing to salue the matter by supposing that <hi>the Printer might be in fault.</hi> But I see now, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B. will take it vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; and I must shew reason for what I said. What others therefore may deeme of it I know not.

                     </p>
                     <p>Yea but there be some sayings in mine owne Booke that auerre it. Let vs heare them.</p>
                     <p>Why first <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, <note n="i" place="margin">Bern. de divers. serm. 26.</note> 
                        <hi>That which seemeth Chance to vs, is a certaine word of God acquainting vs with his will.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First for the <hi>Translation,</hi> then for the <hi>Exposition,</hi> and the end for which it is alledged. The words of <hi>Bernard</hi> are <hi>Sermo quidam,</hi> that is, word for word, <hi>some kinde of word,</hi> or to auoid ambiguitie, <hi>a word in some sort.</hi> For I hope M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B. when he translateth it, <hi>a certaine word,</hi> doth not take <hi>certaine</hi> in that sense that he did, who expounding the words of the Gospell, <note n="k" place="margin">Luk. 16. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>There was a certaine rich man,</hi> obserueth thence, that though the <hi>Rich man</hi> there mentioned, were otherwise an euill man, yet he was <hi>sure</hi> and <hi>certaine</hi> of his word.

                     <p>For the <hi>exposition</hi> of it how it is to be vnderstood, because I shew <note n="l" place="margin">Of Lots, Chap. 2. Sect. 3.</note> there at large whence by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B. it is cited, I doe thither refer my Reader. Only I adde

thereunto, vpon further view of the place, that it is euidently apparent by the whole sequell of the <hi>Sermon,</hi> (the maine scope whereof is to perswade men <hi>to rest satisfied with Gods will and pleasure in all accidents and occurrents,</hi> as losse of friends by decease, and the like) that <hi>Bernards</hi>

But no more will it hence follow, that there is <hi>an immediate prouidence of God in all casuall things,</hi> more than in any other sort of euents. Gods decreeing will in euery euent is reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by his worke. And <hi>euery euent,</hi> be it casuall, or not casuall, is <hi>a word of God</hi> reuealing his pleasure vnto vs, and acquainting vs with his will.</p>
                     <p>For the latter <hi>allegation</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

G.</hi> as it is a Lot (say I) wholly disposed by God: Therefore an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate prouidence is in an ordinary Lot, (as it is a Lot) wholly disposed by God.

B. and therefore by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. <hi>Axiome,</hi> it must bee so in <hi>an ordinary</hi> one also. For this I suppose it is that he would say. But he must first shew where I acknowledge <hi>an immediate prouidence</hi> to be <hi>in euery extraordinary Lot,</hi> which I deny to be in many thousands of them: and then proue it <hi>to be in such a Lot as it is a Lot;</hi> which to affirme and not proue, is to require that in effect without proofe to be granted, which all the <hi>controuersie</hi> is about, and which he must not thinke will be yeelded vpon his bare, <hi>I say.</hi>

                     <p>The other Argument is this, which is the Kil kow. If in euery Lot there be necessarilie an immediate worke and prouidence of God, then it is in the naturall power of man to make God worke immediatly at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
                     <p>But to say that it is in mans power naturally to set God on working immediately at his pleasure, is absurd. There is not therefore an immediate worke and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God necessarily in euery Lot. <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G.</hi> like an Orator seemeth desirous to draw his Aduersary into ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by these words, <hi>[Necessarily, Naturall power, Set God on working, At pleasure, To say,</hi> and <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd]</hi>

                     <p>It followeth not from the one to the other. And the reason is apparent. Because in <hi>the extraordinary Lot</hi> the euent required, be it, to finde out a malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, as in <note n="t" place="margin">Iosh. 7. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.</note>

                        <hi>Sauls</hi> case, cannot certainly bee effected without such <hi>an immediate prouidence;</hi> whereas in <hi>the ordinary Lot,</hi> nothing is to be determined, but may well and certainly be decided without it. But if it be so, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B. saith, that <hi>therefore in an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Lot there is an immediate prouidence; and therefore a setting of God on working immediately so oft as such a Lot is vsed, because an ordinary Lot is by Gods speciall aduice to end a Controuersie:</hi> How is that true both in his <hi>Dialogue,</hi> and in the very next words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied

                  <p>Lastly, a Lot is no religious act, nor holy thing of it selfe, as <note n="r" place="margin">Chap. 6. §. 6.</note> before hath beene shewen: there is much difference therefore betweene Lots, and the word of God, Sacraments, and Oaths. For these things
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:3067:110"/>
are holy of themselues and in their owne nature, as the very definitions of them will soone shew: and therefore cannot but be holy. Whereas a Lot is not in the nature and the definition of it holy, and therefore is not alwaies and necessarily sacred. Yea those things are now holy, as euer, in our ordinary vse; whereas no Lot is holy that we can vse now adaies; nor indeed was euer any so, saue extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily. But Gods taking of any thing sometime extraordinarily, or from ordinarie vse, to apply it to some holy and extraordinarie vse, doth not exempt the kinde in generall, but the thing only it selfe so vsed in speciall from ciuill or light and ordinarie vsage; and that also so long only as it is so set apart: As the vse of water in Baptisme hindreth not but that a man may play with water, yea and with that very water that may afterward be a Sacrament in Baptisme, or that hath so beene, but is not now. In like manner, when a Lot shall be extraordinarily vsed for a speciall signe of Gods immediate electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and choise, whosoeuer shall then contemne or set light by that Lot, he shall abuse an holy thing and Gods name in so doing; but not whosoeuer shall vse otherwise any Lot to disport, yea though it were that Lot that had beene vsed in such a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse before; there remaining no more holinesse in it after that vse is ouer, than in <note n="s" place="margin">Exod. 3. 2, 5.</note> the bush that burnt but wasted not, when God manifested him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to <hi>Moses</hi> in it, after that manifestation was once ended.</p>

Betweene which two sorts there is much difference in the case now questioned. It being <hi>no tempting of God to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect</hi> such an <hi>extraordinary worke</hi> of his in the one, because without it that could not be certainly effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, for which he had inioyned them to be vsed. Whereas in the other it is; because neither the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse whereunto they are vsed, requireth it, nor hath God himselfe any where promised it. So that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:3067:112"/>
it is not <hi>the want of</hi> either <hi>command</hi> or <hi>warrant</hi> for the vse of them, but the <hi>expecting</hi> or <hi>requiring</hi> that which there is <hi>no ground</hi> or <hi>promise of God</hi> for in the vse of them, that maketh them guilty in that kinde.</p>
                     <p>That which followeth therefore I auow still, and can easily make good; both that <hi>all extraordinarie Lots now vsed are vnlawfull,</hi> and no better than <hi>meere Soreeries;</hi> as the attempting by <hi>Lot</hi> to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a malefactor would be, which yet was lawfull when <note n="*" place="margin">Iosh. 7. 14, 15.</note> God enioyned it.</p>
                     <p>And againe that to vse any <hi>Lots</hi> in that manner as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B. prescribeth, to wit, with <hi>inuocation for</hi> and <hi>expectation of a speciall and immediate worke of Gods prouidence</hi> therein, or <hi>to put things to Lot vpon presumption of such prouidence,</hi> is <hi>to tempt God,</hi> he hauing no where promised any such thing.</p>

                     <p>Againe it is to be obserued, that he sets downe a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison betweene an Oath and a Lot, which I set not downe, whereby the minde of the Reader may be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. For I say not: As the truth of a thing is by an Oath put to Gods Testimony; so in an Ordinary Lot the right of a thing is put to Gods immediate prouidence. This is it that I say: As an Oath in the Nature thereof supposeth the testifying presence of God: so a Lot, in the Nature thereof, supposeth the determining presence of God. My reason is, <hi>Ending a Controuersie;</hi> I say not, <hi>Deciding a right:</hi> For before diuiding the land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise by Lot, no Tribe, or family could challenge more right to one portion than to another. Ending (I say) a controuersie is by a Lot referred to Gods determining, the same by his whole or immediate disposing the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Lot to a certaine euent.</p>

                     <p>Now then let vs consider the places produced to proue it. The former (saith <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G.</hi>) was faithlesse. I say so too. Because that Lot was without any warrant.

                     <p>What is all this to proue that <hi>in a Lot, as in an Oath, praier is euer vnderstood or implied.</hi> A man might as well reason thus; <hi>Our Sauiour</hi>

                     <p>But both their Lots were extraordinary, wherein was an immediate prouidence of God. Therefore they might well beleeue that they should pray.

                        <hi>The instance of election of Offices is besides the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. For it is not argued thus: Because Gods people praied when they vsed a Lot; therefore there is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate</hi>

                        <hi>prouidence of God in a Lot. But thus: There is an immediate prouidence of God in a Lot: Therefore Gods people praied when they vsed a Lot.</hi>

                     <p>Then belike it was produced to proue nothing at all that was to be proued. For the point to bee proued was not that <hi>Gods people praied at the vse of a Lot,</hi> but that <hi>that a Lot doth suppose the determining presence, or immediate prouidence of God.</hi> Which hereby also M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B. endeuoured to proue. But now M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B. it seemeth, taketh that for a thing granted; which is the point that he is to proue.</p>
                     <p>The instance is to the purpose; for it doth shew that <hi>Praier is not therefore implied in a Lot, as in an Oath,</hi> though it be vsed thereabout.</p>

                     <p>If then there be an immediate prouidence of God in a Lot, and in regard thereof praier is to be expressed or vnderstood in the lawfull vse of a Lot, then praying and playing (though they rime well together, yet) run not well together in the lawfull vse of a Lot. Nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it followeth from both, That a Lot is not to be vsed but in a case of necessitie more or lesse. And therefore strange (I will not say, absurd) is <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G<hi rend="sup">s</hi>.</hi> Position p. 111. to wit, The lesse weightie the matter is, wherein a Lot is vsed, the lawfuller the Lot is. Except it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that the lesse weightie the matter is, the greater is the necessitie of ending the controuersie by a Lot. The said Position is more strange, because he granteth p. 95. That Prayer specially applied to the Lot may (in some case) be conceiued, where the matter is more weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as in the choise of a Magistrate.

For the same cause an ordinarie Lot is the Name of God and an Holy thing, and therefore not to be abused in sport. But <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G.</hi> hath shewen before, that a Lot is not in it selfe an Holy thing. Indeed; he would haue shewen in his third
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:3067:116"/>
Reason, inducing him to allow lusorious Lots, as not euill in themselues, that a Lot is not holy either in it selfe, or by diuine institution. Whereunto I haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy answered somewhat. But hauing learned more (oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally) by his further dispute, I will now for some more satisfaction, answer somewhat more. A Lot (saith <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G.</hi> p. 132, &amp; 133.) is not holy either in it selfe, because a Casualtie hath no holinesse in it selfe: For then all Casualties should be holy: or by diuine institution in the word sanctifying it to some holy Vse.</p>
                     <p>I answer briefly. Is an extraordinary Lot the Name of God, an holy thing in it selfe, because of Gods imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate prouidence therein, and not an ordinary Lot in respect of the same prouidence? If it be, Then though all casualties be not holy in themselues, yet all lawfull Lots be holy in themselues. So that as the Bush that burnt and wasted not, was holy, when God manifested himselfe to Moses in it, p. 156. So a Lot is holy, because of Gods speciall presence therein. Herein they differ. The Bush was holy but for a time, because God was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in it but for a time: Where as a Lot is holy from time to time, so oft as it is lawfully vsed, because of Gods speciall presence therein from time to time. Therefore howsoeuer sport might haue beene made with the Bush, the presence of God being remoued; yet ought sport neuer be made with a Lot, because Gods spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall presence is euer therein.</p>

                  <p>But God hath sanctified Lots to a proper end; viz. to end controuersies<note n="*" place="margin">Num. 26. 55. Prov. 18. 18.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Therefore man is not to peruert them to a worse; viz. to play, and by playing to get away another mans money, which without controuersie is his owne.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="T.G.s_answer">
                  <p>This Argument thus conceiued is faulty two<note place="margin">T. G. Answer. Of Lots, chap. 7. Sect. 13.</note> waies. For first it goeth from the question, which is not whether any Creature or ordinance of God may be <hi>peruerted,</hi> or peruersly vsed; but whether the vse of Lots questioned; be a peruerting of them or no; whereas in the conclusion it is taken for granted that it is. Neither againe is the question whether men may vse Lots playing for money; (a thing incident to other games as well as these; which whether it belawfull or no, I shall not need now to diseusse) much lesse, whether they may be vsed in game to that end, to get another mans mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from him, or no; (which is no generall vse of them, nor hath any place at all there, where either there is no wagering at all, or where the Lot is vsed onely at the beginning of the game, to decide who shall ioyne, who lead, or the like:) but whether Lots may in any wise be vsed in sport.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is more inferred in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion than was in the premisses, and that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:3067:118"/>
not from ought in them. For the vse of a Lot in play is euer to decide some question or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie, though a light one it is like, yet a question or controuersie truly so termed; otherwise it were no Lot.</p>
                  <p>For the mending of these faults, the Argument may better be conceiued on this manner:</p>
                  <q>That which God hath sanctified to some proper vse, is not to be applied to any other, especially a worse vse. But <note n="a" place="margin">Their proper vse is to decide great controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies. <hi>Perkins</hi> gold. chaine, chap. 20. on precep. 3.</note> God hath sanctified Lots to this proper vse, to wit, the deciding of controuersies in matters of weight. A Lot therefore may not be applied to any other vse, much lesse to a worse.</q>
                  <p>The Proposition is proued by <note n="b" place="margin">Matth. 21. 12, 13. ex Esai. 56. 7. &amp; Ier. 7. 11.</note> an instance of the Temple, set apart for praier, which the Iewes therefore are reproued for applying to market and merchandise.</p>
                  <p>The Assumption is confirmed principally by that saying of <hi>Salomon,</hi> 
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Prov. 18. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lot stinteth strife, and maketh partition among the mighty.</hi> For <note n="d" place="margin">Num. 26. 55.</note> the other place is but an instance that a Lot once was by Gods owne appointment so vsed. It is amplified <hi>à simili,</hi>

                     <hi>vs, that men vse an Oath to end controuersies; (which euery man knoweth) but that God hath dedicated and made an Oath holy and sure onely for that vse of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie deciding of doubts-of importance among men: so the like words vsed of a Lot must be vnderstood in the same sense<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not so much to teach vs that a Lot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded such controuersies among men, which all know, but that God hath ordained it onely for that vse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the fuller answer to this Argument and the<note place="margin">ibid. sect. 14.</note> proofes of it, diuers distinctions, of some good vse, would be obserued.</p>
                  <p>First therefore the word, <hi>sanctifie,</hi> is diuersly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. For to omit all other acceptions; it is taken sometime in a larger sense; and so <hi>to sanctifie</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth to assigne a creature to any speciall or singular vse whatsoeuer, either sacred or ciuill: thus are <note n="i" place="margin">Esai. 13. 3.</note> the <hi>Medians</hi> said by God to be <hi>sanctified</hi> for the subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and sacking of <hi>Babel:</hi> and so are <note n="k" place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 4.</note> meats said to be <hi>sanctified by Gods word</hi> for mans food; and <note n="l" place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 14.</note> the <hi>vnbeleeuing Mate sanctified to the maried beleeuer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometime againe it is taken in a stricter sense; and so <hi>to sanctifie</hi> signifieth to set apart a Creature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side his ordinary vse to some sacred and spirituall imployment: as where it is said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 2. 3.</note> God <hi>sanctified the seuenth day</hi> of the world; and where <note n="n" place="margin">Exod. 20. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Now in both these kindes may the Lord well be said sometime <hi>to sanctifie,</hi> but <hi>not to appropriate;</hi> when by his ordinance he either inioyneth or gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the vse of a Creature so in some kinde, as yet

                  <p>To apply these distinctions then to the present Argument: If they take the word <hi>sanctifie</hi> in the stricter sense, the Proposition is true, but the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption is vnsound: for Lots are not set apart, or said so to be in either of the <note n="a" place="margin">Prov. 18. 18.

they speake of things <hi>sanctified onely</hi> but not appropriated, or of things both sanctified and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated too, and that either the whole kinde in generall, or some of the kinde only.</p>
                  <p>If of things sanctified onely, but not appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Proposition is not true; For <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 23, to 28.</note> bread and wine are sanctified to be seales of Gods couenant, and yet doth not that hinder <note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 104. 15.</note> the lawfull vse of them otherwise: so was oyle sometime <note n="d" place="margin">Leuit. 21. 8, 10, 12.

                     <p>Well; then let vs consider his Opposition made to the Assumption, and the amplification thereof. Doth <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

Is Recreation (in generall) inioyned by precept, if not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, yet (at least) by iust consequence? as <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

Doth God more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully prouide for recreations, than for peace among his people? But <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:3067:126"/>
being by Gods speciall direction, if it be lawfull; there may haply be no present controuersie. Where as the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect matter of an ordinary Lot being something questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned betweene man and man, there may be a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie. I say, May be. For if it be well obserued, in an ordinary Lot there is not alwaies a present contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie to be determined: But alwaies some question to be decided to preuent a controuersie. As may appeare by <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G<hi rend="sup">s</hi>.</hi> owne words, partly here, where he saith, [That there must be some question or controuersie, or else it is no Lot] but more euidently where he saith; that the Lot vsed by the Souldiers about Christ his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which he truly calleth a serious diuisorie Lot, was to preuent all contention and strife, p. 176. &amp; 177. Such was the Lot also which was vsed about the Land of Promise, about which was no present controuersie. For God who would haue no controuersies, would haue such things remoued, which may cause or iustly occasion controuersies. Therefore <hi rend="sup">m</hi> Christ expounding the Commandement, Thou shalt not kill, forbiddeth words of prouocation. About which ordinary Lot, God, who knoweth how ordinary or common controuersies, and the occasions thereof be, giueth direction in Prou. 18. 18.</p>

G.</hi> taketh knowledge: so it is true, that Hebr. 6. 16. intimateth, That as an Oath, for confirmation, is among men an end of all strife: so Gods Oath for confirmation of his promise to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, was to put the matter out of doubt, question, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie. Else these words [An end of strife] were to no purpose. But that they were to the purpose by me
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:3067:127"/>
vnderstood, appeareth in the two next verses, where it is written, That God bound himselfe by oath, as to shew the stablenesse of his counsell, so that the heires of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise might haue strong consolation. So that Gods oath to Abraham tooke away doubting, questioning, and all strife that might be, not onely in Abrahams minde, but also in the mindes of the heires of promise.

                     <p>It is true, that a matter of lesse weight in it selfe, may be the subiect matter of a controuersie, as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouer sie may be among men, as well meane, as mighty in their estate, as <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G.</hi> here saith, p. 137. For by mighty men (as in Gen. 6. 4. so) in Prou. 18. 18. are meant men strong in affections, so as the controuersie cannot be well ended without a Lot, whether the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect matter of the Controuersie be of more or lesse weight in it selfe, so as there is a necess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Neither doe I say, that onely great quarrels are to be ended, or preuented by a Lot, as <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G.</hi> denieth not, but some may. For (as he saith truly, p. 173.)

What is that onely vse of a Lot? I can finde none other than the putting of that to a Lot which he calleth, (p. 130.) A matter of meere indifferencie, that is, Such as is not materiall, whether a man doe or omit.

                     <hi>Cain</hi> hath but one sonne mentioned by <hi>Moses,</hi> therefore he had no more sonnes or children but him.

For how many things are there whereof there is no example in Gods word, and yet the vse of them is generally allowed as lawfull and good? Many things there are where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of no precedent of the vse of them but in some one kinde onely, which yet may be vsed also vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. No vse of butter recorded in the word but for food onely: may it not therefore be vsed also for physicke? Yea many things there are of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vse, whereof there is no mention at all in Gods word, which yet all generally allow: as sugar for sweetning, printing of books, shooting in guns, and the like, which all by this argument are vtterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; or if they be iustified, then the grounds of it faile.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, an Action may haue <note n="h" place="margin">Voluntas Dei di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur praeceptio, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitio, consilium, permissio.

For where God hath not limited the vse of any Creature or ordinance, there he hath left the vse of it free. Where he hath not determined the circumstances of any acton, there what he hath not prohibited, that hath he permitted, and that is warrant sufficient for it. Where therefore circumstances are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:3067:132"/>
the argument holdeth from the negatiue to make that vnwarrantable, that is not either expresly or by good consequence inioyned. But where they are not determined, the argument is strong enough from the negatiue to proue that warrantable that is not either expresly or by iust consequence prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.</p>
                  <p>For this cause in the point of Gods worship the argument holdeth <note n="i" place="margin">Ier. 7. 31. &amp; 19. 5.

But in ciuill affaires it will not hold from the negatiue to disallow ought; because God hath not so determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them. Else what warrant is there for boules, for tennis, for foot-ball, for chesse, &amp;c. which yet no man disalloweth? Let one example serue for all to shew the weaknesse of this kinde of arguing. <hi>There is neither precept, nor practise,</hi> (<note n="l" place="margin">1 Sam. 14 31, 10 35.</note> at least allowed or allowable) <hi>of eating bloud in Scripture: therefore a man may not eat a blacke pudding.</hi> In which conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion I assure my selfe these Authors will not accord with the <hi>Familists</hi> and new <hi>Sectaries.</hi> And yet may they say more against the one, than these can any of them against the other.

                     <q>That which Abraham did not, no Christian man may doe: But Abraham neuer plaied at Cards, or Abraham neuer vsed a sporting Lot: Therefore no Christian man may doe either.</q>

                     <p>Secondly, why may there not be for a thing permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, some precept in the word, generall or implied? The permission of any thing must be in the word, either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse or by iust consequence, and then the thing so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted is indifferent. But <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G.</hi> reconcileth these two Axiomes, [Euery Action is indifferent] and [No Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is indifferent] thus, Euery naked and bare Action simply conceiued, is indifferent: But no action clad with his particular circumstances is indifferent, p. 94. So that he concludeth it to be most true, That no particular
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:3067:139"/>
morall Action, or no Action of the reasonable Creature, proceeding from reason, can possibly be so indifferent, but it must of necessitie be either conformable to the rules of Gods holy word, or disconformable thereunto, p. 95. These things, especially these words <hi>(rules of Gods word)</hi> considered, I may say, that howsoeuer a naked indifferent thing be by permission, yet a clothed indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thing, if lawfull, is by precept, or rule, as well as <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G.</hi> saith, Recreation in generall is both by permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and by precept, if not expresly yet by iust conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence p. 138.

                        <hi>To the last I answer, That a Lot is no more a ciuill affaire than is an Oath, though it (as is an Oath) be vsed in ciuill affaires.</hi>

                     <p>Here is no <hi>Question</hi> about it whether it be or no: but a <hi>Proposition,</hi> which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B. hath all this while forgot, to be iustified. As for the rancking of <hi>a Lot</hi> and <hi>an Oath</hi> together; and the supposed <hi>sacred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of a Lot,</hi> enough already hath beene said. But why doth not M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B. answer here, the <hi>Question</hi> of <hi>Boules</hi> and <hi>Balls,</hi> (for it is very materiall) and the <hi>point</hi> concerning <hi>a blacke pudding?</hi>

                     <speaker>I. B.</speaker>
                     <p>And lastly, I affirme againe, that God hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the vse of a Lot to determine Controuersies, so as
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:3067:144"/>
without Gods speciall appointment (which is not now to be expected) it cannot be lawfully vsed to any other purpose: Therefore an Argument from the Negatiue will hold by <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. G<hi rend="sup">s</hi>.</hi> rule to disallow the vse of any other Lot, as well lusorious as diuinatorie.</p>

                     <p>I will not stand to discusse here how this helpeth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. arguing, <hi>That is not lawfull whereof no exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is found in the word,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>I obserue onely how M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B. can conclude, by helpe of <hi>my Rule,</hi> what he would, if you grant him withall, what he can not proue. But the <hi>Antecedent</hi> should in the former <hi>Argument</hi> haue beene made good: which yet M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B. there not onely hath not done, but hath not so much as indeauoured to doe. And without <hi>proofe</hi> for him to <note n="k" place="margin">Propter nostrum affirmare aut nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re nihil ponitur in esse. Beda in Axiom.</note> 
                        <hi>affirme it againe and againe,</hi> is but lost labour both to his Reader and himselfe.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>first</hi> he denieth this <hi>Proposition: That which may be vsed in other Ciuill affaires either weighty or lesse weighty, may be vsed also in disport.</hi> I <hi>reply</hi> by way of <hi>Induction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>an instance</hi> to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of any thing that may be vsed indifferently in the one and not in the other: that of <hi>an Oath</hi> will not serue.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>second Argument,</hi> the <hi>former shape,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth this <hi>Proposition, That which best sorteth with the nature of a Lot, may a Lot most lawfully be vsed vnto:</hi> which for my part shall neuer be further proued.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>latter shape</hi> (the vaine <hi>cauill</hi> to the <hi>forme</hi> of it omitted) he denieth this <hi>Proposition; A matter of meere indifferencie, such as a man may lawfully doe or not doe, and it is not materiall whether he doe or omit, a man may lawfully put to the hazard of the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine motion of the Creature whether he shall doe or no:</hi> yet with a restraint, <hi>vnlesse it be a matter controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> And let that, for me, rest too, and others iudge of it.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>third Argument</hi> he affirmeth, <hi>The vse of a Lot in Game, as it is a Lot,</hi> to be <hi>against Piety,</hi> because <hi>it is not of faith; against Charitie,</hi> because <hi>it scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>eth.</hi> That is an idle <hi>consequence;</hi> this euidently vntrue of <hi>a Lot in Game</hi> simply considered: and he maintaineth <hi>euery Lot</hi> to be <hi>holy by some diuine Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> which I require to be produced.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>fourth Argument,</hi> he denieth nothing at all that I say, not conceiuing or vnderstanding mine <hi>Argument</hi> aright. I affirme <hi>any vse of the Creature</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3067:146"/>
               <hi>lawfull, that it hath a naturall power vnto, so the same be kept free from superstition, impiety, iniustice, and dishonestie.</hi> Which qualification he suppresseth, and so denieth the forepart.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>fift Argument,</hi> he denieth nothing at all, but some <hi>Assertions</hi> of his owne framing, and the effect of the <hi>Conclusion. Lottery,</hi> say I, <hi>is a thing of it selfe indifferent, neither simply commanded nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden:</hi> therefore by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fennors grounds, lawfull to be made matter of disport. Alusorious Lot,</hi> saith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B. <hi>is forbidden,</hi> and <hi>therefore not indifferent.</hi> Which crosseth nothing but the <hi>Conclusion</hi> onely in <hi>mine Argument.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>sixth Argument</hi> he miserably peruerteth, and in roome of it setteth vp one of his owne, which he keepeth much adoe with: Which I would wish him now to take better notice of, being in the plainest manner that may be laid open to his eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight.</p>
            <p>For the fuller answer whereunto, (because it is much materiall to the clearing of the present <hi>point in Controuersie</hi>) I would desire him onely to shew by what <hi>Arguments</hi> or <hi>Argument</hi> deduced from <hi>Gods word,</hi> the <hi>vse of Boules and Chesse-play</hi> may be <hi>iustified.</hi> Not that I doubt whether it may be done or no; but that I may vnderstand how M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B. will doe it: not doubting but his manner of doing it, if it be sound and such as it should be, will bring much light to this matter.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>defence</hi> of his owne <hi>Arguments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>first</hi> hee must proue, if he will make it
<pb facs="tcp:3067:147"/>
good, that <hi>an immediate prouidence of God in euery Lot,</hi> is proued out of <hi>Prou.</hi> 16. 33. which as yet he hath not done.</p>
            <p>And if hee will disproue or ouerthrow mine <hi>Arguments</hi> against it, hee must affirme such <hi>an immediate prouidence in euery Casuall Occurrent:</hi> as also <hi>a naturall power in man to make God worke immediately,</hi> and consequently <hi>miraculously at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:</hi> and answer my <hi>reasons</hi> produced to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>second</hi> hee must proue the same, to wit, <hi>an immediate diuine prouidence in euery Lot:</hi> for that is the ground of this also; and is oft re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, neuer proued: and that once proued will effect all.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>third</hi> he must proue that that place, <hi>Prou.</hi> 18. 18. doth so <hi>restraine the vse of a Lot to the ending of Controuersies in serious matters, that to no other vse it may be applied:</hi> to which purpose there is not a word here.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>last,</hi> hee must make good, if hee will maintaine <hi>his owne Proposition,</hi> that <hi>nothing is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full whereof there is no example in Gods word.</hi>

            <p>Or if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Easties,</hi> that <hi>nothing is by permission warrantable;</hi> or, <hi>Nothing warrantable but by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.</hi>

            <p>These <hi>few points</hi> if hee can make good, all will soone be at an end. And these would be handled apart, (other by-matters discussed by themselues) that so what is said to the purpose may the better be seene, and the truth in the
