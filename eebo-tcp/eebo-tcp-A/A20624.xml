         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

from <hi>Leo</hi> 3. who 800 yeares after Christ, is the first Pope which Canonized any, I had not obserued that this had euer beene done: Neither do I think that <hi>Paulus</hi> 5. was drawne to the Can onizing of this woman by any other respect, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that <hi>Rule</hi> which shee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <note place="margin">Valladerius fol. <hi>57.</hi>

And since Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> old <hi>Epistles</hi> trouble and dis-aduantage this Church, they were glad to apprehend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of his new writing, which might be for them, that so this new worke of his might beare witnesse of his second conuersion to <hi>Papistry,</hi> since by
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:169:75"/>
his first conuersion to <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> they got nothing: for to say, that in this businesse <hi>Paulus</hi> 5. <hi>could not choose but be God, God himselfe,</hi> to say, <hi>that hee must needes haue liued familiarly with the God-head: and must haue heard Predestination it selfe whispering to him: And must haue had a place to sit in Councell with the most Diuine Trinitie,</hi> (all which <hi>Valladerius</hi> sayes of him) is <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fol.</hi> 5.</note> not necessary in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherein the Popes, for the most part, proceed, as humane affections leade them. But at last, after some enquiry, I found that a certaine idle <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zettier,</hi> which vsed to scrape vp Newes, and Rumours at <hi>Rome,</hi> and so to make vp sale letters, vainer, and falser, then the Iesuites Letters of <hi>Iapan,</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> had brought
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:169:76"/>
this newes to <hi>Hell,</hi> and a little Iesuiticall <hi>Nouice,</hi> a credulous soule, receiued it by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit faith, and published it. I laughed at <hi>Lucifers</hi> easinesse to beleeue, and I saw no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son euer after, to accuse him of infidelity. Vpon this I came backe againe, to spie (if the gates were stil open) with what affection <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and they who were in auncient possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that place, behaued themselues towardes one an other. And I found him yet in the porch, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning a new contention: for hauing presently cast his eyes to the principall place, next to <hi>Lucifers</hi> owne <hi>Throne,</hi> and finding it possest, he stopt <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and asked him, who it was that sate there. It was answered, that it was <hi>Pope Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface;</hi>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:169:76"/>
to whom, as to a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Innouator, for hauing first chalenged the name of <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersall Bishop,</hi> that honour was affoorded. Is he an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uator thundred <hi>Ignatius?</hi> shall I suffer this, when all my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples haue laboured all this while to proue to the world, that all the <hi>Popes</hi> before his time did vse that name? And that <hi>Gregory</hi> did not repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the <hi>Patriarch Iohn</hi> for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to himselfe an Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian name, but for vsurping a name which was due to none but the <hi>Pope.</hi> And could it be fit for you, <hi>Lucifer,</hi> (who in this were either vnmindfull of the <hi>Romane Church,</hi> or else too weake and incapable of her secrets and mysteries) to giue way to any sentence in <hi>Hell,</hi> which (though it were
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:169:77"/>
according to truth,) yet dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from the Iesuites <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles?</hi> With this <hi>Ignatius</hi> flyes vpwardes, and rushes vpon <hi>Boniface,</hi> and throwes him out of his Seate: And <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> went vp with him as fast, and gaue him assistance, least, if hee should forsake him, his owne seate might bee endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered. And I returned to my body; which

was with this returne of my soule sufficiently resreshed.
