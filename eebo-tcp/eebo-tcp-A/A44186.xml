            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ALtho' Piety and Religion be the glory of <hi>Youth,</hi> as well as the Crown of <hi>Old Age;</hi> And <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> to incourage <hi>Young Men</hi> to imbrace and practice it, tells them, <hi>That Wiſdom hath length of days in her right-hand, and in her left-hand riches and honour, and that ſhe will promote thoſe who do exalt her, and bring them to honour that do embrace her.</hi> Yet <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>here is nothing more common than for thoſe of your Age to neglect and cast off the practice of Piety and Religion, as things too mean and trivial for them to be concerned about, and imploy themſelves wholly in purſuing the ſenſual pleaſures and delights of ſin and wickedneſs, as tho' they were reſolved to ſpend
<pb facs="tcp:108760:3"/>
all their preſent time in doing that which will be bitterneſs to them in time to come, and thought that their Youth were to be imployed only in treaſuring up matter for repentance, and ſorrow in Old Age: Which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Advice contained in the following Sheets very needful and neceſſary, eſpecially at this Seaſon, when too many, eſpecially Young Men, under pretence of rejoycing for the Birth of their Saviour, do all they can to diſhonour Christ and gratifie their own ſenſual and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Inclinations. I do not pretend (like ſome that have ſhamm'd ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Tracts upon the World, under pretence of their being written by the Reverend Author of the <hi>whole Duty of Man</hi>) that the enſuing Sheets were written by the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hales,</hi> in the Method
<pb facs="tcp:108760:3"/>
and with the ſame Title wherewith I preſent them to thee; But yet thou may'st aſſure thy ſelf, that they are all the true and genuine Works of that venerable Author, and are the ſame Advice which he gave whil'ſt living to his own Children. And finding upon my peruſal of them, that they had ſomething more of weight and excellency in them than I had ever yet obſerved in any thing of that kind, I thought them very well worthy and deſerving of a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral reading, than they were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of whil'ſt ſcattered up and down in ſeveral larger Volumes.</p>
            <p>Abaniſhing the thoughts of Death and Eternity; An obſcene, licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and extravagant liberty of the Tongue; An unthankful recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and an ungrateful forgetting
<pb facs="tcp:108760:4"/>
the greatest Favours and Deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; And a violating and prophaning the Sabbath, are moſt natural and common ſins of Youth, and are for the moſt part the cauſe of all other Vices, in regard they viciate and debauch the mind and diſpoſe it for the ingaging in and perpetrating the worſt of Crimes, as appears by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Confeſſions of thoſe whoſe Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Debauchery brings them to an untimely Death. And therefore this wiſe and prudent, as well as holy and religious Judge, took a more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary care to prevail with his Children to forſake and guard themſelves againſt thoſe leading and foundation Sins. And I aſſure my ſelf, that if thou wilt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly read and conſcientiouſly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the Directions which he gave them, in order thereunto, thou wilt then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this to be the beſt <hi>New-Years Gift</hi> thou ever yet received'st.</p>

            <head>THE <hi>Father's</hi> New-Years-Gift TO HIS SON.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>SOlomon</hi> who was inſpired by the Almighty, with a Spirit of wiſdom above all that ever went before him, or have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after him, tells us, That it
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:108760:5"/>
is the indiſpenſible Duty of all Young Men to <hi>Remember their Creator in the daies of their Youth, before the evil day come or the years draw nigh, wherein they will ſay, they have no pleaſure in them.</hi> Notwithſtanding which it is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable to ſee the Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Debauchery, Irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Atheiſm, that general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abounds in the Youth of our Age: But that thou maiſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure thy ſelf from being reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among their number, do thou ſeriouſly make it thy buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to furniſh thy mind richly with the Knowledge, Nature, and Deſign of the true Religion, which thou wilt find to be the greateſt improvement, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and priveledge of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:108760:5"/>
nature, and that which gives it the moſt noble and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pre-eminence above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther viſible creatures whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. And when thou haſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed thy ſelf, let not that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone content thee, but do thou ſeriouſly ſet thy ſelf to the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, and particularly, make Conſcience of a due ordering thy Speech, making Preparation for thy Death, returning ſutable Praiſe for Mercies received, and Sanctifying the Lords Day; for the better performing whereof, obſerve the enſuing Directions.</p>
            <p>And Firſt of the Ordering of your Speech; which conſiſt of two branches, Firſt, how to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the ſpeech of others when they ſpeak to you; and Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108760:6"/>
how to order your own.</p>
            <p>As to the former of theſe, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve well what is the Temper and Diſpoſition of thoſe Perſons whoſe Speeches you hear; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be wiſe, grave, ſober and diſcreet Perſons, for if they be ſuch, their ſpeech will be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly like themſelves, and well deſerves your ſerious attention, and ſtrict obſervation. But if they are light, vain, impertinent, or paſſionate Perſons, their ſpeech is for the moſt part ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Temper, and therefore the greateſt advantage you can reap thereby, is to learn their diſpoſitions and diſcern their failings, whereby you will make your ſelf the more cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, both in your converſation
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108760:6"/>
with them, and your own ſpeech and deportment towards them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If perſons whom you do not very well know to be men of Truth and Sobriety, relate ſtrange ſtories, be not over ready to be Believe or Report them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If you hear a man report any thing to the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage or reproach of one that is abſent be not ready to believe it (only obſerve it and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it) till you have heard what the accuſed perſon has to ſay for himſelf, for it may be, the thing is not true, or not all true. Or it may be ſome circumſtance which the relater conceals, may juſtifie, or at leaſt allay and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:108760:7"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If any man acquaints you with an injury that is done you by another, either in words or actions, do not preſently give credit to it, nor entertain angry thoughts of the accuſed perſon, for poſſibly it may be only the malice or miſtake of the accuſer, and how unſeemly would it be if your credulity and paſſion ſhould carry you upon a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed injury to do wrong to one who hath done none to you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If any man whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity you do not very well know, makes you exrtaordinary promiſes and profeſſions, give him as kind thanks as may be, but give not much credit to his words, for it is to be preſumed he hath ſomewhat beſides kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108760:7"/>
to you in his intention, and when he hath ſerved his turn upon you or finds himſelf diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, his pretended kindneſs will ſoon vaniſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> If a man flatter or commend you to your face, or to one whom he knows will tell you again, it is a thouſand to one but that he either has already, or elſe means to deceive and abuſe you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> If a perſon be Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leric and give you ill Language, do you rather pity him then imitate him in returning the like; and ſo you prevent the kindling more heat, and find that Silence, or at leaſt very gentle words are the moſt exquiſite revenge of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches that can be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:108760:8"/>
               <hi>Eightly,</hi> Some men are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in the knowledge of Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, ſome in Gardening, and ſome in the Mathematicks; in all your converſation, therefore learn wherein the skill and excellence of the perſon with whom you converſe lyes, and put him upon talk of that ſubject, and obſerve it well, and remember it, that ſo you may glean up the worth and excellency of every perſon you meet with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly,</hi> Converſe not with a Lyer or a Swearer, or one of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcene or Wanton Language, leaſt he thereby corrupt you, or make you to be looked upon by others to be of the ſame prophane tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Or if it ſhould do neither, yet thoſe kind of Diſcourſes will
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108760:8"/>
fill your memory, and ſo be troubleſom to you in time to come, for you will find the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances of the paſſages; which you have long ſince heard of this nature, will haunt you, when you would have your, thoughts better imployed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your own Speech,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let it be always true; never ſpeak any thing for a truth, which you know to be falſe, becauſe that is a great ſin againſt God, who gave you your Tongue to ſpeak your mind with, and not to report a lye.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As you muſt not lye, ſo you muſt not come near it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108760:9"/>
by equivocating or report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that abſolutely, which you have only by hear-ſay, or the relation of others, or at beſt but by conjecture or opinion only.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let your words be few, eſpecially if ſtrangers or men of more experience or underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or that are any way your betters are in place. For elſe you will do your ſelf a double injury, 1. By betraying your own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and folly; And, 2. By rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing your ſelf of the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which you might otherwiſe have to gain Wiſdom, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and Experience, by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe whom you ſilence by your impertinent talking.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:108760:9"/>4. Be not over earneſt, loud, or violent in your talking, for thereby you will ſometimes, for want of pondering your thought, over-ſhoot your ſelf, and loſe your buſineſs.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Be careful not to interrupt another whilſt he is ſpeaking, but hear him out, that ſo you may underſtand him the better, and be able to return him the more ſuitable anſwer.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Always before you ſpeak, eſpecially when the buſineſs is of any weight and moment, think before you ſpeak, and weigh the ſence of your mind which you intend to utter, that ſo your Expreſſions may be ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant, pertinent and inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</p>
            <p n="7">

            <p n="8">8. Be ſure you do not give an ill report of any, unleſs you are ſure they deſerve it; and in moſt caſes, tho' you know a man doth deſerve ill, yet you ought to be ſparing in reporting ſo of him, unleſs it be when you are called to give teſtimony for the ending of a Controverſie, or the concealing the Crime, may harden the Man in his evil way, or bring another into danger, and then even Charity it ſelf obliges you to ſpeak your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Avoid Swearing in your ordinary converſation; and not only Oaths, but Imprecations
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108760:10"/>
and earneſt and deep Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions too. For as you have the commendable Example of good Men, to juſtifie a Solemn Oath before a Magiſtrate, ſo you have the Precept of our Saviour for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding it otherwiſe.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Avoid ſcoffing, and bitter and biting jeſting and jeering, eſpecially at the condition, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, deformity, or the natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of any perſon, for ſuch things leave a deep impreſſion, and are a moſt apparent inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; and if you your ſelf were ſo uſed, you would take it amiſs: and oftentimes ſuch Injuries coſt a man dear, when he thinks little of it.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Be careful, that you give no reproachful, menacing, or
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108760:11"/>
ſpiteful Words, to any perſon, no not to Servants, or thoſe who are your Inferiours. 1. Becauſe there is not the meaneſt perſon, but you may ſometime or other ſtand in need of him. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ill words provoke ill words again, and commonly ill words gained by ſuch a provocation, eſpecially if they come from an inferiour, affect more, and wound deeper, than ſuch as come with that provocation, or from one who is our equal.</p>
            <p n="12">12. When you have occaſion to ſpeak in company, be careful, as near as you can, to ſpeak laſt, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if ſtrangers are in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; for by this means, you will have the advantage of knowing the judgment, temper and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108760:11"/>
of others, which will give a great light into the nature of the thing you are diſcourſing of, and help you to anſwer with the more advantage and the more ſecurity againſt giving offence.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Be careful not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend your ſelf; you ſhould ſhun flattery from others, but eſpecially avoid flattering your ſelf, leſt it makes others believe your reputation to be ſmall and ſinking.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Abhor all filthy and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcene ſpeeches, for thereby you will both diſcover the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your heart and corrupt it more.</p>

            <p n="16">16. Do not upbraid or deride any man for a pious, ſtrict, or religious Converſation; if he be ſincere, you thereby diſhonour God and injure him; or if he be a Hypocrite, yet it is more than you know; or at leaſt, his piety and ſtrictneſs, is not his fault, but his hypocriſie and diſſimulation, and though the one is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, yet the other is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and not derided.</p>
            <p>In the next place, ſee that you frequently meditate on and make preparation for thy <hi>dying Hour.</hi> For although it be the moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain known and experienced
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108760:12"/>
Truth in the World, that all Men muſt dye and come to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet moſt Men being loth to entertain the unwelcome thoughts of their own latter end, forget their mortality, and put far from them the evil day; As if a ſerious preparation for death and an everlaſting ſtate, were no buſineſs of theirs, and only concerned them that are actually dying and paſſing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the Tribunal of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But yet this their way is their folly, and one of the greateſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of thoſe other follies that uſually attend their lives, and therefore that thou may'ſt free thy ſelf from this imputation of folly, and become wiſe, do
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108760:13"/>
thou wiſely conſider thy latter End, and make it thy buſineſs to entertain thy felf with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and ſerious Meditations of Death and Eternity; and for thy encouragement in ſo doing, aſſure thy ſelf that thou ſhalt reap a double advantage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, for firſt, it will help thee to Live well, and ſecondly, to Dye eaſily.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It will teach thee to live better, which it doth,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By warning and admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thee to avoid and forſake thy Sins. For when thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders, that thou muſt certainly dye, and that thou knoweſt not how ſoon it may be, thou wilt then think with thy ſelf: Why ſhould I commit theſe things
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108760:13"/>
which if they do not haſten my latter end, yet they will make it more uneaſie and troubleſome by reflecting then upon what I have done amiſs. I was for any thing I know die to morrow, why therefore ſhould I commit this evil which will then be Gall &amp; Bitterneſs unto me, would I do it if I were ſure I ſhould dye to morrow, if not O why ſhould I do it to day, ſince I am certain that tho' I ſhould not dye to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, yet it will not be long before I muſt, perchance it may be the laſt act of my life! O therefore let me not conclude ſo ill, and cloſe up the laſt Scene of my life with that which may peradventure uſher in my Eternal Death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It will be a great motive
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108760:14"/>
and means to put thee upon the beſt and moſt profitable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of thy time. There are certain Civil and Natural Actions of our lives that the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God hath indulged and allowed to us, and indeed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us, with moderation to uſe, as the competent ſupplies of our our own natures with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and ſobriety, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for our families and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations without coveteouſneſs or anxiety, the diligent and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful walking in our callings, and the like. But there are alſo other buſineſſes of greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, which are attainable without injuring our ſelves in thoſe common concerns of our lives, namely, our knowledge of God and of his Will, of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108760:14"/>
doctrine of our Redemption by Chriſt, our Repentance of ſins paſt, making and keeping our peace with God, acquainting our ſelves with him, living to his Glory, walking as in his preſence, praying to him, learning to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on him, rejoycing in him, and walking thankfully before him: Theſe and the like things are the great buſineſs and end of our lives and beings, and the reaſon why we enjoy them in this world, and withal fit and prepare us for that which is to come. And therefore the ſerious conſideration, that our lives are ſhort and uncertain, and that death will ſooner or latter over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take us, puts us upon the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and practice to do this our
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108760:15"/>
great work <hi>whilſt it is called to day,</hi> that ſo we loyter not away our day and neglect our task, whilſt we have <hi>Time and Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to do it, leſt the night over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take us when we cannot work.</hi> And if thou wilt wiſely conſider thy latter end, thou may'ſt then do this great buſineſs, this <hi>one thing neceſſary,</hi> with eaſe and quietneſs, without any neglect of what is neceſſary to be done in order to the common neceſſaries of thy life and calling: For aſſure thy ſelf, that it is not theſe that rob thee of thy time, and prevent thy minding the <hi>one thing neceſſary,</hi> but it is thy negligence, thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of pleaſure, thy immoderate and exceſſive Cares and Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs for wealth and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108760:15"/>
thy exceſſive eating and drinking, thy curioſity and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Theſe are the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptives, that do not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt that precious time which might be with infinite advantage ſpent in <hi>working out thy ſalvation with Fear and Trembling,</hi> and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the great work and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of thy life. But alſo when Sickneſs and Death comes and God calls upon thee to give up the account of thy Stewardſhip, will perplex thy thoughts, and fill thy ſoul with confuſion, when thou ſhalt find that thy work is not half done, or it may be, not at all began, and yet thy day is ſpent, thy night approaching, and thy lamp juſt ready to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, ſo that what thou doſt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108760:16"/>
then will be with abundance of trouble, perplexity, and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and peradventure, after all thy ſoul will take its flight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou haſt brought it to any perfection. Therefore do thou wiſely provide againſt all that miſchief at the hour of thy death, by a due conſideration of thy latte end, and a making uſe of thy preſent time and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to do thy great work in, whilſt it is called to day, becauſe the night certainly cometh when no man can work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The wiſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy latter end, and the imploying thy ſelf upon that account about the one thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, will moſt certainly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy life the moſt pleaſant and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108760:16"/>
comfortable life in the World: For as a man who is before-hand in the world, hath a quieter life in reference to externals, than he that is behind-hand; ſo a man that takes his opportunity to gain a ſtock of grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with God, and hath made his peace with his Maker, through Chriſt Jeſus, hath done a great part of the chief buſineſs of his life, and is ready upon all occaſions, for any Condition which Divine Providence ſhall aſſign him, whether it be of life or death, of health or ſickneſs, of poverty or of riches; for he is as it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand both in the buſineſs of his Everlaſting State, and of his
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108760:17"/>
preſent Life too. So that if God lend him longer life in this World, he ſtill carries on his great work to greater degrees of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and that too with the greateſt eaſe and facility ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, without any kind of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, trouble or perturbation whatſoever. And if he cuts him ſhorter, and calls him preſently to his Bar, his work being done before-hand, and his accounts ready and fairly ſtated, he joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully imbraces the meſſage of death: <hi>And bleſſed is that ſervant whom his Maſter, when he comes, ſhall find ſo doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:108760:17"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The frequent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of thy latter End, will teach thee to dye Eaſily.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In regard thy frequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of thy approaching Death and Diſſolution will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it ſo familiar to thee that thou wilt not be afraid of it when it comes. The fear of Death is often times more terrible than Death it ſelf, but by thy frequent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating of it thou wilt learn not to fear it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In regard by thy frequent Conſideration of thy latter end, Death becomes no Surpriſe to thee. The great Terror of death is when it ſurpriſes a man at unawares, but by this anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108760:18"/>
of it, and ſerious preparation for it, thou wilt take away all poſſibility of thy being ſurpriſed or afrighted by it, in regard thou wilt be alwaies ready to receive it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In regard the greateſt ſting and terror of Death, are the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented and unpardoned Sins of the paſt life; the thoughts of whereof are the main ſtrength the Elixir, and the very venome of Death it ſelf. But if thou wiſely conſider thy latter end, thou wilt then take care to make thy Peace with God in thy life time, and get the pardon of thy ſins ſealed in the blood of Chriſt; To enter into Covenant with God, and to keep it by husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108760:18"/>
thy time, for the promoting his Honour, obſerving his Will, and keeping his Laws, that ſo thou may'ſt keep thy own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience always clean, and thy Evidences for Heaven clear, whereby the Malignity of Death will be cured, the bitterneſs of it healed, and the fear of it wholly removed. And if thou canſt but entertain it with ſuch an appeal to Almighty God, as once the good King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> made, <hi>viz. Remember now, O Lord, I beſeech thee, how I have walked before thee, with a perfect heart,</hi> &amp;c. it will make the thoughts and the approach of Death no terrible buſineſs to thee at all.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:108760:19"/>4. But that which will above all other things render Death eaſie to thee, if thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt it thy buſineſs to enter into a frequent conſideration thereof, is this, That by the help of this conſideration, and the due im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of it, Death will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come nothing to thee, but only a Gate to give thee admittance into a better Life; it will not be to thee ſo much the diſſolution of thy preſent Life, as it will be the changing of it for a far more glorious, happy and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Life, ſo that though thy Body die, yet thou wilt not, for thy Soul, which is the moſt noble part of thee, only makes tranſition from her life in the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108760:19"/>
Body, to her life in Heaven, not ſo much as one moment of time intervening between her quitting the one, and her enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the enjoyment of the other. And this is the great Priviledge which the Son of God hath obtained for us, that by his Death he ſanctified it to us, and by his Life hath conquered it, not only in himſelf, but for us too. It is true, this paſſage, through death, is ſomewhat ſtreight and painful to the Body, which is left by the way, but the Soul paſſes through, without the leaſt harm or any expence of time, and in the very next moment acquires her eſtate of happineſs and glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:108760:20"/>In the next place, when you have received great Mercies from the hand of God, be ſure that you return Praiſe and Thankſgiving to him, eſpecially if it be a recovery from ſome ſore and deſperate Diſeaſe, wherein Almighty God brings you down to the very Gates, and ſhews you the Terrors of Death, and yet after he hath ſhown you the Spectacle of your own Mortality, wonderfully reſcues and delivers you from that danger, and gives you a new life, as it were from the dead; Reſolve therefore to live that Life to his Glory, that you have received from his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108760:20"/>
and in order to your doing ſo, I would have you always remember,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Affliction comes not forth of the Duſt, nor doth Trouble ſpring out of the Ground, but from the Wiſe and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling Providence of God, whoſe Prerogative alone it is to bring down to the Grave, and raiſe up again.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Almighty God being of moſt Infinite Wiſdom, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Mercy, he hath Wife and Excellent Ends in all the Diſpenſations of his Providence, and that therefore he never ſends an affliction, but it brings a Meſſage with it; his Rod has a Voice, a Voice commanding us
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108760:21"/>
to ſearch and try our Ways, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of our Sins, humble our ſelves under his mighty Hand, and turn to him that ſtrikes us, which Voice be ſure that you hear and obey.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How uncertain and frail a creature man is, even in his ſeeming ſtrongeſt age and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of health; For even then a Peſtilential Air, ſome ill Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in the Blood, the Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction it may be of a ſmall Vein or Artery, a little Meat ill digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a Thouſand other Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents may upon a ſudden, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving him the leaſt warning, plunge a man into a deſperate and mortal Sickneſs, and bring him to the Grave.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:108760:21"/>4. That your condition can never be ſo low, but that God hath power to deliver you, and you ought to truſt in him; nor is your condition ever ſo ſafe and ſecure, but you are within the reach of his Power alſo to bring you down: and therefore think not that now your turn is ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, you ſhall have no more need of him, and that therefore you my live as you liſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That Sickneſs, as well as Death, undeceive men, and ſhews where their true, wiſdom lies: When a Young Man eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially is in the career of his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Pleaſure, he thinks Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the fear of God, and the practice of Piety, to be but
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108760:22"/>
pitiful, fooliſh, low, mean, and inconſiderable Matters, and that thoſe who practice them are a ſort of ſilly, brain-ſick, me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lancholy and unintelligent Per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſons, that want Wit or Breed<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing, and underſtand not them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves or the World. But on the other ſide, they think themſelves to be the only Men that live bravely and ſplendidly, in regard they can Drink and Roar, Whore and Swear and Blaſpheme, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt fear. But ſo ſoon as ever a fit of Sickneſs ſeizes him, &amp; death looks him in the Face, and tells him he muſt die, that his Glaſs is almoſt out, and hath only a few Sands left to run, then his judgment of things is altered
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108760:22"/>
and he cries out of his <hi>former Follies</hi> and <hi>Intemperance</hi> as <hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Vexation</hi> and <hi>Torment,</hi> and tells you, <hi>That he now ſees plainly, that to be truly religious is mans greatest happineſs;</hi> to which he adds many <hi>Solemn Promiſes</hi> of <hi>Amendment</hi> and <hi>Reformation,</hi> if <hi>God</hi> will be pleaſed to ſpare him. Be ſure therefore that you always keep this in your mind, and make conſcience of performing your <hi>ſick-bed Proteſtattons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. How <hi>pitiful</hi> and <hi>inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> a thing the <hi>Body</hi> of Man is, and how ſoon the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of it is turned to <hi>ſaintneſs</hi> and <hi>weakneſs,</hi> its <hi>beauty</hi> to <hi>uglineſs</hi> and <hi>deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and its <hi>whole conſiſtence</hi> to <hi>putrifaction</hi> and <hi>rottenneſs;</hi> and

then remember how fooliſh a thing it is to be <hi>proud</hi> of ſuch a Carkaſs, and ſpend all or the greateſt part of thy time in <hi>trimming</hi> and <hi>adorning</hi> of it, or in <hi>pampering</hi> and <hi>pleaſing</hi> thy <hi>Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite;</hi> and yet this is the chief buſineſs of moſt <hi>young Men</hi> in this Age, but let it not be thine.</p>
            <p n="7">7. To avoid <hi>intemperance</hi> and <hi>ſinful Luſt,</hi> for although <hi>Sickneſs, Diſeaſes,</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> are by the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> of our <hi>Nature</hi> incident to all Mankind, yet <hi>Intemperance, Whoring, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs,</hi> and <hi>Diſorder,</hi> bring more <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> and deſtroy more <hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>healthy young Men</hi> than the <hi>Plague,</hi> or any other <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> or <hi>accidental Diſtempers;</hi> for

            <p n="8">8.

               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:108760:25"/>3. This ſeventh portion of Time which God hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to ſet a part for him, was both by his Precept and Example confined to the Seventh day from the Creation of the World, till the finiſhing of the great work of our Redemption by the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, the Mediator of the New Covenant.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But our Saviour Chriſt who is the Eternal Son of God, bleſſed for ever, and Lord of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, having fulfilled the work of our Redemption on the firſt day of the week, tranſlated the obſervation of the ſeventh day of the week to the firſt day, which is our Chriſtian Sabbath. So that as our Chriſtian Baptiſm ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the Sacrament or Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108760:26"/>
and as our Chriſtian Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha the Sacrament of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, ſucceeds the Jewiſh Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſo our Chriſtian Sabbath, the firſt day of the Week, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the old Sabbath of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day of the week. And that Morality which was by Almighty God confin'd under the Law to the ſeventh day, is now under the Goſpel transfer'd to the firſt day of the week, and that which would have been moraly a viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the morality of the fourth Command before the Death of Chriſt, is a breach of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and a violation of the Chriſtian Sabbath, if done upon the firſt day of the week.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to what ought not to be done, you muſt take this as a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:108760:26"/>
certain Truth, that what is not lawful to be done on another day, is much more unlawful to be done upon this; beſides which there are many things which are lawful to be done upon another day, and ſome that are not only lawful, but alſo fit and neceſſary to be done, which yet muſt not be done upon this day, ſuch as following the works of our Callings, Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, Recreations, and the like.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What things may be done upon that day is a Queſtion of great latitude, in regard Mens Circumſtances vary, and renders that lawful to one man that is not ſo to another: But yet things of abſolute neceſſity, either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Man or Beaſt, may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be done upon the Lords
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:108760:27"/>
Day; as the ſtopping the breach of a Sea Wall, the ſupporting a houſe that by a ſudden Tempeſt is like to fall down, the pulling out a Beaſt that is fallen into a Ditch, ſetting a broken Bone, Adminiſtring Phyſick, Milking of Cows, feeding of Cattle, the neceſſary dreſſing of Meat for a Family, and many other things of that kind; but yet therein, great Care and Caution is to be uſed, leſt under pretence of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, you do what you pleaſe, For</p>
            <p n="1">1. That is not neceſſity that excuſes a work upon this day, which might have reaſonably been ſoreſeen and done the day before.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That is not neceſſity that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:108760:27"/>
may be forborn till to morrow without any abſolute deſtruction or loſs of the thing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Works of Charity, as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Poor, Adminiſtring Phyſick, Viſiting or Comforting the Afflicted, Admoniſhing the Diſorderly, perſwading Peace between Neighbours offend, and endeavouring to compoſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences which require not much examination, or cannot well be deferred; theſe are not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted but commendable upon this day, and we are commanded to perform them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As for what is proper, fit and neceſſary to be done in order to your Sanctification of the Lords Day, be ſure that you Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly obſerve and practice the following Directions.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:108760:28"/>1. Meddle not with any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, Paſtimes, or the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary work of your Calling, from Saturday Night at Eight of the Clock, till Munday Morning, for although Saturday night be not part of the Sabbath, yet it is fit you ſhould then be preparing your Heart for it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Riſe at leaſt three hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Morning Sermon, and when you have made your ſelf fully readys and fitted your ſelf for Solemnity of the Day, read two Chapters in the Bible, and then go ſolemnly to your Private Prayer and deſire of God his Grace to enable you to ſanctifie his day and after that read another Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and let your read be with Attention, Obſervation and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108760:28"/>
Uncovered on your Head.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When you are in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip and Service of God, be uncovered all the time of Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Praying and Preaching.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Be very devout and ſerious at your Prayers, and very atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in hearing the Sermons, and to prevent your mind from wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, you will do well to write the Sermon, which will help to fix your Thoughts, and make you liſten to the Sermon with the more diligence and attention.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let your Deportment at Church be very ſerious and grave, uſe no Laughing nor Gazing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, nor Wiſpering, unleſs it be to ask thoſe by you ſomething of the Sermon that you ſlipped in Writing.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:108760:29"/>6. Joyn with the Church in all the ſolemn and publick Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Day, and Sing the Singing Pſalms with the reſt of the Congregation.</p>
            <p n="7">7. After Forenoon Sermon, eat moderately at Dinner, rather ſparingly then plentifully, that ſo you may be fit for the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons Exerciſe, without drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs or dulneſs.</p>
            <p n="8">8. After Dinner walk about half an hour in the Garden, or in your Chamber, to digeſt your Meat, and then repair to your Cloſet, and peruſe your Notes, or recollect what you can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Sermon, until it be Church time.</p>
            <p n="9">9. If you are well beſure you go to Church Forenoon and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:108760:29"/>
and be there before the Miniſter begin, and ſtay till he hath done, and all the while you are there, carry your ſelf Gravely and Reverently.</p>
            <p n="10">10. After Evening Sermon, go to your Cloſet, and having read a chapter in the Bible, examin what you have writ, or recollect what you remember, and afterwards if the Sermon be repeated either in your Fathers or in the Miniſters Houſe, go to the repition thereof.</p>
            <p n="11">11. In all your Speeches and Actions on that day, let there be no lightneſs or vanity, uſe no Running, Leaping, or Playing, or Wreſtling, uſe no Jeſting, or telling Tales, or fooliſh Stories, nor talk about News or Worldly Buſineſs, but let both your Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:108760:30"/>
and your Words be ſuch as the Day is, Serious and Sacred, and tending either to inſtruſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or inform your ſelves in the great buſineſs of your Knowledge of God, and of his Will, and of your own Duty.</p>
            <p n="12">12. After Supper and Prayers ended in your Fathers Family, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to your Cloſet, and there upon your Bended Knees, implore Pardon of God for what you have amiſs and beg his Bleſſing upon what you have heard, and his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of all your Performances for the merits and ſatisfaction of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, perform all this Chearfully and Heartily, Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly and Honeſtly, and account it not a burden to you, for aſſure
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:108760:30"/>
your ſelf that you ſhall find a Bleſſing from God in ſo doing, and remember it is your Father that tells you ſo, who loves you, and will not deceive you, and (which is more then that) remember that the Eternal God hath Promiſed, Iſa. 58. 13, 14. <hi>If thou turn away thy Foot from the Sabbath, from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy Pleaſure on my Holy Daq, and call the Sabbath a Delight, the Holy of the Lord Honourable, and ſhalt Honour him, not doing thy own ways, nor finding thine own Pleaſure, nor ſpeaking thine own Words, then ſhalt thou delight thy ſelf in the Lord, and I will cauſe thee to ride upon the High places of the Earth, and feed thee with the Heritage of Jacob thy Father, for the Mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi>
