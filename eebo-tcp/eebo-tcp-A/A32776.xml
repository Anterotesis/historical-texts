         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Description of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Author
<hi>Camden</hi> hath been at great Pains, and
taken Information from the most Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent,
in the <hi>Antiquities, Peerage</hi> and
Constitutions of the Kingdom; and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
from Sir <hi>Alexander Hay</hi> Secretary of
State, who in the year 1608, did succeed in that Office to
the Lord <hi>Balmerinoch;</hi> till which time, he hath given
the most full and exact account of our Nobility, or Lords of
Parliament, in the Order and Description of the Countries
or Shires, the Places from which they take their Designations,
and where they have their Interest or Residence; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Work deserves very well a Second Edition, for the
benefit of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland;</hi> which if it had been
finished in due Time, as it was begun to be Printed, might
have been a part of the Second Edition of the whole <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannia,</hi>
and will always be a Treatise by it self concerning
<hi>Scotland,</hi> to satisfy these whose Curiosity lead them no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>In this Edition, little Alteration is made from the
Words of the Author, albeit now less used, except where
the Error or Mistake can be mended by a few Words, and
might have proceeded, rather from the Fault of the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriber
or Printer, then the Author; and I have left out
the <hi>Latine Lines</hi> made by <hi>Johnston,</hi> the Poet on several
Occasions, and also the Translation of them in <hi>English
<pb facs="tcp:57011:3"/>
Rhime,</hi> as Tending more to increase the Volumn, then to
give Light to the History; and have made Alteration of
these words which directly relate to the former Treatise, as
a part of it, and so have omitted the Authors Preface and
Apology, for his <hi>little experience in</hi> Scottish Affairs, <hi>which
he lightly passeth over, reserving the due Honour to these
of that Nation, with a more full Pinsel to set forth these
Matters.</hi> Albeit in several things of more remote and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Times he is mistaken; yet still the Treatise is useful,
and deserving well to be published: nor is he or his Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
lyable to Censure on that account, most of these being
Vulgar Errors, passing in that Time, and since, for truth:
and a second Edition was more proper, passing over
them, then in this to have Commented upon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted
the Author, which is but seldom and
slenderly done, in Matters only concerning the Kingdom
in General, and the Great <hi>Stewarts</hi> of <hi>SCOTLAND,</hi>
the Progenitors of our Kings.</p>
            <p>It will be a Task, requiring great time, skill and pains,
and the help of more knowing persons, by particular Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises,
going in order from the greater Antiquity downward,
out of the most antient and approved Histories, most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
Collections and authentick Records and Documents, to
describe the considerable and eminent Families, who
have by their Actions deserved to be Noticed, without which
the Account of the Nation in general, and of the other great
Families will be incompleat; albeit some of them did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
attain to the Degree of Peerage: seing in the Sense and
Language of our <hi>Law,</hi> as well as of the <hi>French,</hi> the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
is composed of the <hi>Barons, Free-holders,</hi> and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
<hi>Tennents</hi> of the King, and not of the <hi>Peers</hi> only, now
called <hi>Lords of Parliament.</hi> In which undertaking, the
Errors in this Treatise, to the Advantage of some, and
<pb facs="tcp:57011:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Prejudice of other Families, may be rectified; and in the
mean time, the <hi>Publisher</hi> of this Edition is not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
of the Opinion, that all the Matters contained
therein, are to be received as Truth, and is not to
Incurr the displeasure of any, by the further publishing of
these smaller Errors.</p>
            <p>If in the <hi>Supplement and Addition,</hi> the <hi>Publisher</hi> hath er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in anything, upon better Information, &amp; full Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he is most willing to amend, and shall study to find an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to publish the same: and if in the Descriptiou of some
Families, he hath been more Large then in others, it is not to
be imputed to Partiality, but that his Knowledge and Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
was not alike full in all. As to these more ancient.
<hi>Lords,</hi> who are described by the Author, the <hi>Publisher</hi> hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
no more particular account of the times of their Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
then the Author did, reserving that to another Time and
Occasion; but hath been more special in the Accounts of the
Later <hi>Lords,</hi> and in the method of the Author hath men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
them, according to the Order of the Situation of the
several Places from which they have their Designations:
Some Errors are mended in the Description of Places, but
in that, exactness is not studied, there being particular
Maps and Descriptions of the Countries by <hi>Straloch</hi> and
<hi>Scotstarbat,</hi> Printed <hi>anno</hi> 1654, and lately by Mr.
<hi>Adair,</hi> some more exact Tables are published, and the rest
dayly expected.</p>
            <p>It is Observable, That a great part of the Nobility, since
the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the Sixth, have made and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
their Estates, by being Members of the <hi>Colledge
of Justice,</hi> or <hi>Session,</hi> and obtaining the Erection of Church
Benefices, (whereof they were Commendators) in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Lordships, to them and their Successors: the finer
Spirits, who formerly were imployed in the Wars, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb facs="tcp:57011:4"/>
Churchmen, since the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the
Fifth, beginning to apply themselves to the <hi>Laws,</hi> some
of them did attain to the Degrees of <hi>Lords</hi> of <hi>Session,</hi> and
other publick Imployments; and for their better Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
were rewarded with Abbacies in <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
and were Created <hi>Peers,</hi> or <hi>Temporal Lords</hi> of
<hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is likewise worth Observing, That King <hi>James</hi> the
Sixth (after his Succession to the Crown of <hi>England)</hi> did
make a considerable Addition to the antient Nobility of this
Nation, by new Creations, as well as in his other Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
for in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as well as here, the
<hi>Peers</hi> were much diminished by Forfaultures, extinction of
Dignities, and by the suppression of the Abbots, and Priors,
which Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had not supplyed.</p>
            <p>Since the <hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> the Constitution of
our Parliament did receive a considerable Alteration, the
Clergie, the <hi>third Estate,</hi> for some time, being almost A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished;
and these in the <hi>Sederunts of the Parliaments,</hi>
and <hi>Articles pro Clero,</hi> not being Church-men, but meer
Laicks, Titulars and Commendators of Abbacies and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ories;
and of them seldom a full and equal Number with
the other Estates in the <hi>Articles,</hi> and for the most part but
two or three of them designed <hi>Bishops,</hi> who had not the full
Power and <hi>Episcopal Jurisdiction,</hi> which was for a long time
lodged in the <hi>Synods</hi> and <hi>General Assemblies,</hi> and the only
Popish-Bishop, who imbraced the Reformation, and continued
in Office in the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> was <hi>Adam Bothwel,</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Orkney.</hi> There was also a great Alteration in the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
of Barons and Free-holders in Parliament, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
fred by <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> King <hi>James</hi> the First,
from general appearances in <hi>Parliament</hi> to which they were
formerly lyable, and allowed to send their Commissioners to
<pb facs="tcp:57011:4"/>
represent them; yet if this Act was ever observed, it was long
in desuetude, till revived in the <hi>Parliament 1587;</hi> Since
which time the <hi>Free-holders</hi> of the Shires, under the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Peers, have sent their Commissioners to represent
themselves and their Vassals in <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To supply these Alterations, it was necessar that more
should be Created <hi>Lords of Parliament,</hi> to come in proper
Right, and as representing these holding their Lands of
them, as the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Abbots</hi> did for themselves and
their Vassals, in right of their <hi>Baronies,</hi> which they held
immediatly <hi>of the Crown;</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> being again sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest,
as well as <hi>Abbots</hi> and <hi>Priors,</hi> whose Lands are pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
by the <hi>Peers</hi> or <hi>Free-holders,</hi> or their Vassals, the great
number of <hi>Peers</hi> is still more reasonable, whereof the half
do never appear in <hi>Parliament,</hi> by reason of <hi>Minority,</hi> or as
being <hi>Females,</hi> or being otherways Legally incapacitat or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to take place there; and also, the Addition of Twenty six
Members, by a late <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> to the representation
of the <hi>Barons,</hi> did make a just Ballance, the Free-holders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
a great part of the <hi>Property of the Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is to be remembred, that of those Dignities noted as
Extinct, some of them do stand in the Rolls of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
their Honours being lately enjoyed, and the Rolls not
altered, but by special Warrand.</p>
            <p>To the Treatise, is subjoyned a List of the <hi>Nobility</hi> with
their <hi>Sirnames,</hi> and the <hi>Titles</hi> of such of their eldest Sons who
are Lords, and of the other Members of this <hi>Current Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
Commissioners for <hi>Shires</hi> and <hi>Burghs Royal;</hi> and
a second Alphabetical Table of these whom the <hi>Publisher</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to have been created, or to have used at anytime, the
Titles or Dignities of <hi>Lords, Viscounts, Earls, Marquesses</hi>
and <hi>Dukes;</hi> and a Table of the <hi>Abbacies</hi> &amp; <hi>Priories,</hi> especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
these who were <hi>Conventual,</hi> once a part constituent of our

               <hi>Parliament;</hi> with a List of the <hi>Presbytries, Synods</hi> and
<hi>Commissariots</hi> not specified in the Treatise.</p>
            <p>These are the few Things with which the <hi>Publisher</hi> thought
fit to advertise the Reader, <hi>Farewel.</hi>

               <p>Moreover, according to the Situation and

divided into two parts: the South on this side
the River <hi>Tay,</hi> and the North beyond <hi>Tay;</hi>
besides a number of Islands lying round about.
In the South part, these Countries are more

his Precedency, doth relate, <hi>That there
was an Ordinance upon the</hi> 20. Feb. 1623
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57011:11"/>
                  <hi>amongst his Majesties Officers and Counsellors,
where the lesser Officers of State are ranked, and
after them the Lords of Session, according to their
Admission, and before Privy Counsellors being
Barons &amp; Gentlemen.</hi> Suitable to this prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
the Lords of Session have since their
Institution enjoyed the Title of <hi>Lord,</hi> both
in Designation and Compellation, albeit the
Designation be proper to the Lords of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
The Lords of Session in the beginning
being composed of <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Abbots,</hi> and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
beneficed Persons, Chief Barons, and
eminent Lawers; This Designation is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
given to them in the Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and particularly to President <hi>Provan,</hi>
in an unprinted Act, <hi>anno</hi> 1581. intituled <hi>Act
in favours of</hi> Mr. <hi>William Baillie</hi> Lord <hi>Provan,</hi>
&amp; frequently thereafter. All the space between
Sessions, being the times of Sowing and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest,
is Vacation and Intermission of all Suites
and Law matters. They give Judgment accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Parliament, Statutes, and Munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Laws, and where they are defective, they
have recourse to the Imperial Civil Law.</p>
               <p>There are besides in every County or Shire, in
ferior civil Judicatories or Courts kept, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Sheriff of the Shire, or his Depute, decid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Controversies of the Inhabitants, about
violent Ejections, Instrusions, Damages, Debts,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> From which Courts or Judges, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of hard and unequal dealing, or else of
Alliance and Partiality, they appeal some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
to the Session. These Sheriffs are all for
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57011:12"/>
the most part Hereditary, for the Kings of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
like as these of <hi>England</hi> also, to oblige
more surely unto them the better sort of
Gentlemen by their Benefits and Favours,
made in old time, these Sheriffs hereditary and
and perpetual. But the English Kings soon
perceiving the inconveniencies thereby ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
of purpose changed this Order, &amp; appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them from year to year. There be Civil
Courts also in every Regalitie, holden by their
Baillies, to whom the Kings have graciously
granted Royalities: as also in Free-Burghs,
by the Magistrates thereof.</p>
               <p>There are likewise Judicatories, which they
call <hi>Commissariats,</hi> the highest whereof is k<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pt
at <hi>Edinburgh:</hi> In which before four Judges, or
Commissars; Actions are pleaded concerning
Wills &amp; Testaments, the Right of Ecclesiastical
Benefices, Tithes, Divorces, and such other
Ecclesiastical Causes. In every other several
part almost throughout the Kingdom, there
sitteth but one Judge alone in a place about
these matters.</p>
               <p>In criminal Causes,<note place="margin">Courts of Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Matters.</note> the Kings Chief Justice
holdeth his Court for the most part at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
(which Office the Earls of <hi>Argile</hi> exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
for some time,) and he doth deput
two or three Lawers, who have the hearing
and deciding of Capital Actions concerning
Life and Death, or of such as infer loss of
Limbs, or of all Goods. And by the 16 <hi>Act
3d. Sess 2d. Parl. K. Cha. 2d. concerning
the Justice Court,</hi> it doth now consist of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57011:12"/>
Lord Justice-General, the Lord Justice-Clerk,
who are both at the Kings Nomination, and
to them are added five of the Lords of Session,
who are supplied from time to time by the
King, and are called Lords of the Justiciary.
In this Court the Defendant is permitted, yea
in case of High-Treason, to entertain a
Counsellor or Advocat to plead his Cause.</p>
               <p>Moreover in Criminal Matters, there are
sometimes by vertue of the Kings Commission
and Authority, Justices appointed for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding
of this or that particular Cause.</p>
               <p>Also the Sheriffs in their Territories, and
Magistrats in some Burghs, may sit in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Man-slaughter (in case the Man-slay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
be taken within 24 hours after the Deed
committed) and being found guilty by a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
put him to death. But if that time be
once over-past, the Cause is referred and put
over to the <hi>Kings Justice,</hi> or his Deputs. The
same priviledge also some of the Nobility and
Gentry enjoy against Theives taken within
their own Jurisdictions. There be likewise
that have such Royalities, as that in Criminal
Causes they may exercise a Jurisdiction with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their own Limits, and in some Cases recal
those that dwell within their own Limits and
Liberties from the Kings Justice, howbeit
with a Caution and Proviso interposed, <hi>That
they judge according to Law.</hi>

               <p>Thus much briefly the Author hath put
down, as one that had but slightly looked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
these matters, yet by the information of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57011:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
judicious Knight, Sir <hi>Alexander Hay,</hi> Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
to <hi>K. Ja.</hi> 6. for <hi>Scotland,</hi> who had given
the Author good light. He being one of the
three principal Clerks of Session, was in the
year 1608 appointed Secretary in place of the
Lord <hi>Balmerinoch</hi> removed, and admtted a
Lord of Session the <hi>3d,</hi> of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1610. But
as touching SCOTLAND, <hi>what a Noble
Countrey it is, and what Men it breedeth</hi> (as
sometimes the Geographer wrote of Britain)
<hi>there will within a while more certain and more
evident matter be delivered, since that most
high and mighty Prince</hi> K. Ja. 6. <hi>did set it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
for us, which had so long time been shut from
us.</hi> Mean time before we proceed to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of particular Places, according to
the Authors project, we must give some short
Account of the Privy Council, Thesaury
and Exchequer, being Soveraign Courts, and
omitted by the Author. The Privy Council is
constitute by the King's Commission to decide
in matters that concerns the Government and
publick Peace of the Nation, wherein the
Chancellor by his Office doth preside, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him the President of the Council, who
hath the same precedency as in <hi>England:</hi> The
Persons are chiefly named out of the Nobility,
with the addition of some Barons. In the
Thesaury and Exchequer, the Lord high The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saurer
doth preceed, but this Office is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Commission, as it is at present, and then
the Lord Chancellor is, and uses to be one and
Chief of the Commission, as also the Lord
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57011:13"/>
Thesaurer Deput, and they together with
the Lords of Exchequer nominat by Their
Majesties do Order, Determine, and dispose
of the Kings Rents, Revenues, Gifts, and
Casualities: I have omitted particular Lists
of them, in regard the Commissions to the
Council, Thesaury and Exchequer are some
times changed, as the King doth think fit; and
that the persons employed in them are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
of whom occasion will be to make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in some part of this Treatise, either as
Noblemen, Sheriffs of, or Commissioners from

lost the <hi>Property and Possession of the

again, that it was not in the Regents

that Children should undergo Punishment

that being thus Heirs to their fathers Rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

they should not at any time in the haughty
Pride of their own Power, plot any Treason
against Prince or Countrey. This Title of

we must fetch the reason of the Name: and

from the <hi>Companies of Horsemen,</hi> which are
called Wings, or else from those <hi>Wings</hi> in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture,

well Peopled and frequented, by reason
of the opportunity from the Sea, which the

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57011:40"/>
this I know, that out of <hi>Normandy</hi> it came
into <hi>England,</hi> and that divers Families there,
were of the same name: but that in <hi>Essex,</hi>
from which Sir <hi>Thomas Montgomerie,</hi> Knight
of the Order of the Garter, descended, in
the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, gave Arms
a little different from these.</p>
               <p>This noble Linage is fair and far spread, and
out of those of <hi>Gevan,</hi> was that <hi>Gabriel de Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
called Earl of <hi>Montgomerie,</hi> Captain of
the Guard of <hi>Scots</hi> (which <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth
King of <hi>France</hi> instituted for defence of his
own person, and his Successors, in testimony
of their fidelity, and his love toward them)
who in running at Tilt, slew <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
King of <hi>France,</hi> by occasion that a
broken splint of his Spear, where the Helmet
chanced to be open, entred at his Eye, and
pierced into his Brain; and afterwards in that
Civil War, wherein all <hi>France</hi> was in a broil,
whiles he took part with the Protestants, he
was apprehended and beheaded. But the

John</hi> Son to <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Glencairn,</hi> late

               <p>And in a Village called <hi>Miniabruch,</hi> out

                  <hi>But when the northern Nations in the
Reign of</hi> Commodus, <hi>having passed once over
the Wall, had made much waste and spoil in
the Country, the Emperor</hi> Severus <hi>repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
this Wall of</hi> Hadrian. <hi>Howbeit after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the</hi> Romans <hi>brought oft-times the
Country lying between under their subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For</hi> Ninius <hi>hath recorded, that</hi> Carau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius
<hi>under</hi> Dioclesian, <hi>strengthened this Wall
another time, and fortified it with seven
Castles. Lastly, the</hi> Romans <hi>fenced this
place (when</hi> Theodosius <hi>the younger was Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror)
under the conduct of</hi> Gallio <hi>of</hi> Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna.
Now, saith <hi>Bede,</hi> they made a Turff
Wall, rearing it not so much with Stone as with
Turfs, (as having no cunning Artificer for so
great a piece of Work) and the same to no use,
between two Firths or Arms of the Sea, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
miles in length: that where the fense of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was wanting, there by the help of a Wall,
they might defend there Borders from the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of enemies: of which work, that is to say a
very broad and high Wall, a man may see to this
day, most certain and evident Remains.</p>
               <p>This Wall began as is generally believed,
at the River <hi>Aven,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ninius.</note> that goeth into <hi>Edinburgh
Firth,</hi> and having passed over the River
of <hi>Carron,</hi> reacheth unto <hi>Dunbarton:</hi> but <hi>Bede</hi>
affirmeth, that it beginneth in a place called
<hi>Pen-vael,</hi> that is in the <hi>Picts</hi> Language, as
much as <hi>the head of the Wall;</hi> in the <hi>Brittains</hi>
tongue <hi>Pen-Gual,</hi> in <hi>English Penwalton,</hi> in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57011:56"/>
                  <hi>Scottish Cevall:</hi> all which names no doubt are
derived from <hi>Vallum</hi> in <hi>Latine:</hi> and he saith,
that place is almost two Miles from <hi>Abercur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vig</hi>
or <hi>Abercurving;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Abereorn.</note> and it endeth as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

to <hi>Bede</hi> at <hi>Al. cluid;</hi> after <hi>Ninius</hi> at the
City <hi>Pen Aloloyt,</hi> which may seem all one.</p>
               <p>Now this Wall is commonly called <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams
Dyke;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Grahams dyke.</note> either of <hi>Graham</hi> a Warlike <hi>Scot,</hi>
whose Valour was especially seen when the
breach was made through it, or else of the
Hill <hi>Grampie,</hi> at the foot whereof it stood.
The Author of <hi>Rota Temporum</hi> calleth it the
Wall of <hi>Aber. corneth,</hi> that is, <hi>of the mouth of
the River</hi> Corneth: where, in <hi>Bedes</hi> time,
<hi>there was a famous Monasterie standing, as he
hath recorded, upon</hi> English <hi>Ground, but near
unto that Firth or Arm of the Sea, which in
those days severed the Lands of the</hi> English <hi>and
the</hi> Picts.</p>
               <p>Hard by this Wall of Turff, what way as
the River <hi>Carron</hi> crosseth this Sheriffdom of

who in the year 1606, was a Lord of

almost two Miles lower, there is an ancient
round Building four and twenty Cubits high,
and thirteen broad, open in the Top, framed
of rough Stone without Lime, having the
upper part of every Stone so tenanted into
the nether, as that the whole work still rising
narrow by a mutual interlacing and clasping,
upholdeth it self. Some call this the Temple
of <hi>God Terminus,</hi>

father every stately and sumptuous thing upon

it to have been built by <hi>Julius Cesar.</hi>
But I would think rather that <hi>Julius Agricola</hi>
built it, who fortified this frontier part, were
it not that <hi>Ninius</hi> hath already informed us,
that it was erected by <hi>Carausius</hi> for a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphal
Arch. <hi>For he,</hi> as <hi>Ninius</hi> writeth,
<hi>built upon the Bank of</hi> Carron, <hi>a round house
of polished Stone, erecting a triumphal Arch in
memorial of a victory: he re-edified also the
Wall, and strengthened it with seven Castles.</hi>
The mid space between <hi>Duni-pacis</hi> and
this Building, on the right hand Bank of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>
there is yet to be discerned a confused
face of a little ancient City: where the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
people believeth there was sometimes a
Road for Ships, who call it <hi>Camelot,</hi> by a

               <p>To conclude this Chapter, take here a
Description of the principal Seal of the Burgh
of <hi>Stirling,</hi> which carries on the one side a
Bridge of seven Arches, with a Cross mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the the middle, and armed men on each
side of the Cross, with this Inscription,

               </p>
               <p>And on the other side a large strong Castle

<q>Continet hoc in se Nemus &amp; Castrum <hi>Striv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnense.</hi>
                  </q>
Which two Inscriptions they give us in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
thus,
<q>
                     <l>The <hi>Brittains</hi> stand by force of Arms,</l>
                     <l>The <hi>Scots</hi> are by this Cross preserv'd from Harms.</l>

                     <l>Are in the compass of this Seal set down.</l>
                  </q>
Which agreeth well with what <hi>Buchanan</hi>
said, that the River <hi>Carron</hi> was the Bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Conquests, and <hi>Stirling</hi> the
Limits of the <hi>Brittains</hi> and <hi>Scots.</hi> However
it be, the Seal and Inscription must be very
old, when special notice is taken of a Wood
at <hi>Stirling,</hi> whereof there is but small Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains;
and at this place, doth the River
<hi>Forth</hi> admit of a Bridge, which is the secure

To tell you truth, it is uncertain, that it

<hi>Lyons,</hi> (but in these days few) and those very
cruel, fierce, and so hateful of Mankind, that
for a certain time they abhorred whatsoever
they had either handled or breathed upon:
yea, they utterly scorn the forcible strength
of <hi>Dogs;</hi> albeit <hi>Rome</hi> in times past, wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

at the fierceness of <hi>Scottish Dogs,</hi> that it
was thought there, they were brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

this term and name <hi>Caledonii</hi> grew so rise
with <hi>Roman</hi> Writers, that they used it for
all <hi>Brittain,</hi> and for all Woods of <hi>Brittain</hi>

that <hi>Caesar</hi> followed the <hi>Brittains</hi> unto

them in his life: hence also <hi>Valerius Flaccus</hi>

of <hi>David</hi> Earl of <hi>Strathern</hi>'s being a Son of the

Mr. <hi>James Cunninghame</hi> has given a more

it is set down by him, is thus,</p>

               <p>But one <hi>Dowglass</hi> in <hi>New-burgh,</hi> near to
Cross <hi>Macduff,</hi> had by him a Version, which
seems to be much more probable, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Matter, which reads thus,

the Mariners find it the nearer way to convey

although his Books by Authority of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

many things in them contained, are to

on the Bank of</hi> Ratra, <hi>there is a Cave near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
Stangs <hi>Castle, the nature whereof seemeth
not to be passed over. The water distilling by
drops out of a natural Vault, presently turneth
into Pyramidal stones; and were not the said
Cave or Hole otherwhiles rid and cleansed by
mans labour, the whole space as far as up to
the Vault, would in short time be filled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.
Now the stone thus engendered, is of a
middle nature, between Yce and hard Stone:
for it is brittle and easy to crumble, neither
groweth it ever to the solidity and hardness of
Marble.</hi> Concerning those <hi>Claik-geese,</hi> which
some with much admiration have believed to
grow out of Trees; both upon this Shore and
elsewhere; and when they be ripe, to fall
down into the Sea, it is scarce with the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to mention them. That there be little
Birds engendred of old and rotten Keels of
Ships, they can bear. Witness, who saw that
Ship wherein <hi>Francis Drake</hi> sailed about the
World, standing in a Dock near the <hi>Thames;</hi>
to the outside of the Keel, whereof a number
of such little Birds without Life and Feathers
stuck closs. Yet it would be thought, that
the Generation of these Birds, was not out of
the Logges of Wood, but from the very O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean,
which the Poets termed the <hi>Father of

juice or liquor which distilleth out of Trees
in <hi>Britain,</hi> and runneth down into the Sea,
and is therein hardened. <hi>Tacitus</hi> also was of
the same Opinion, when he wrote thus: <hi>I
can verily believe, that likeas there be Trees
in the secret and inward parts of the East which
sweat out Frankincense and Balm, so in the
Islands and other Countries in the West there
be Woods and Groves of a more fatty and firm
Substance, which melting by the hot Beams of
the Sun approaching so near, runneth into the
Sea hard by, and by force of Tempest, floateth
up to the hoars against it.</hi> But <hi>Serapio,</hi> and
the Philosophers of later times write, that it
ariseth out of a certain clammy and bitumin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Earth under the Sea, and by the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side;

<hi>Creighton,</hi> who had wedded the elder, and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57011:96"/>
that through the powerful Authority that
<hi>William</hi> Earl <hi>Dowglass</hi> had with the King;
which was so great, that he advanced not
only him to the Earldom of <hi>Murray,</hi> but also
another Brother to the Earldom of <hi>Ormond;</hi>
and made two Cousins of his Earls, the one
of <hi>Angus,</hi> and the other of <hi>Morton:</hi> but this
greatness of his not to be trusted upon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was excessive, turned soon after to
his own confusion; under King <hi>James</hi> the

this honour of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> his Sister:

<hi>George,</hi> present E. of <hi>Sutherland:</hi> this Dignity

in Processes &amp; Protestations in Parliament, &amp;

by Petition, apply to the Parliament to have
his Precedency declared, which was remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be judged by the Lords of Session, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whom the Process at his Instance against
these Earls is depending. This Country

for the Soil nothing fertile, and by reason of
the sharp and cold Air, less inhabited, and
thereupon sore haunted and annoyed with
most cruel Wolves; which in such violent
rage, not only set upon Cattel, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great damnage of the Inhabitants,
but also assail men with great danger; and
not in this Tract only, but in many other

Heaven, here distant from the Aequinoctial
Line 59. Degrees and forty Minuts, the
longest day containeth 18 hours and 25
Scruples: and the shortest night not above
five hours and 45 Scruples: so that the Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrist
is not true in this, who made report
in times past, <hi>That the Sun in manner setteth
not at all, but passeth by, and lightly glanceth
upon the Horizon; happily relying upon this
Authority of</hi> Tacitus, <hi>for that the extream
Points and plain Levels of the Earth, with
their shade so low, raised up no darkness at all.</hi>
But more truly <hi>Pliny</hi> (according to true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son)
where he treateth of the longest days,
according to the inclination of the Suns Circle
in the Horizon. <hi>The longest days (saith he)
in</hi> Italy <hi>are 15 hours, in</hi> Britain 17, <hi>where
the light nights do prove, that undoubtedly by
experience, which reason forceth credibly, that
in Mid-summer days, when the Sun approacheth
near to the Pole of the World, the places of the
earth under the Pole have day 6 Months, though
the Light having but a narrow compass, the
night contrarywise when he is far remote in
