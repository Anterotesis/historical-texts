         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

because of thy Beauty, and thy dwelling place is scituate in a very fruitful hill, and thou feedest in the vallies of fat Pastures of eternal pleasures, where nothing that defiles can enter, nor no devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer treadeth on thy mountain, nor no Lyons whelp treads in thy path; It is the way of the ransomed of the Lord, who hath blotted out thy transgressions ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more to remember thy sins, thou Seed of Jacob. The Lord is your God for ever, while you be his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, therefore walk before him in righteousness, and let his own works praise him, and give him of his own, and glorifie him with it eternally. Be low in thy heart, and be not exalted because of thy Beauty and Riches, and glory not but only in the Lord: Be diligent in thy mind, and watch against all thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and be not of a careless heart; Eat not of the Vine of Sodom, nor drink not of the Cup of whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; Give not thy strength to strange women, nor let not thy desirable Beauty be over come of Harlots, but keep thy self undefiled, and mingle not thy seed with strangers: but be fruitful in thy pleasant land upon thy beautiful mountain, and bring forth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly unto thy God, who hath turned thy wilderness into a fruitful field and taken away thy reproach of barrenness, in conversation upright and blameless do thou daylie appear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in praises, and honour, and fear, do thou abound, and let thy God be thy Teacher in his light and truth for evermore, that thy enemies may see and be confounded, and may behold, and be ashamed before thee, unto whom thy Rock of defence is a stumbling stone of offence, wherewith the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms

of the earth shall be dashed to pieces, and broken as a Potters vessel before thee.</p>
               <p>Come forth in thy Beauty, and appear in thy glory unto the Nations; Arise, arise, why should thou sit as alone, as in obscurity and darkness undiscovered, let the Princes of the earth see thy excellency, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the Nobles in thy Robes of perfect Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour wherewith thou art decked and trimmed, as a Bride pleasant unto thy Husband; Do thou judge among the Judges, and give thy counsel among the prudent, and appear in thy authority before Kings and Princes; All the Dominions of the world is not equal in Treasure and Wisdom unto thee, but all the children of whoredoms shall see their shame, and be laid naked when thou appears in thy purity; The Nations longs for thee to be partakers of thy vertue, therefore shew thy self and appear, that the rest of thy Flock which yet remains upon the barren moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains may come in unto thy Pold, to rest under thy Shepherds power. O Sion, thou art prepared of thy God to beat the mountains to dust, thou art fitted for his service, to thresh the bills; Make no carrying, but come away, spread thy self into every corner of the earth, for the upright thir steth for thee abundantly; who layeth under the oppression in the land of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which may be felt, from whence thou art freed into the everlasting light, and why should thou O Sion lay at rest, while thy own seed, the children of thy womb are oppressed, groaning in the captivity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the uncircumcised, who hath driven away thy remnant, and scattered it from thee?
