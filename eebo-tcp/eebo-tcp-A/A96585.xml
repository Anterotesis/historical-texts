            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I had beene out with the reſt of our Company diverſe times to finde ſome Rogues, but could not meet any till at laſt going to a Caſtle where wee found it very ſtrong and guarded with two hundred and fiftie Rebels which we put all to the Sword, with the loſſe of ſome three men, and two great Commanders, and at another Caſtle a Mile beyond that, the very ſame day was I ſhot with a Bullet in the Shoulder, which will ſeeme to you very miraculous, for the Bullet made a hole in my Cloake, and a hole in my ſhirt, and wounded my Shoulder, yet never made a hole in my Coate, but a dent which ſhoulder now is well. On <hi>Friday,</hi> wee killed ſome fiftie at another Caſtle, and on the very next day following the Rogues Armie marched the whole day of one ſide of us being tenne to one againſt us, diſplaying their Colours in a moſt glorious way, making themſelves ſure of the victory, having caſt lots the day before for our garments. Our Field peeces, and our Wagons marched ſo farre with us, that we could march no farther, without giving them battle in the field, which we did and in a moment, put them to flight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing twelve thouſand, and we ſcarce three thouſand. And we killed of them that day ſome eight hundred, or very nigh one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, but it was God that did fight our battell for us.</p>

            <p>SInce my laſt, of the laſt weekes Poſt, I have received yours of the twelfth preſent, and have anſwered as by the incloſed. For the affaires in generall, God be praiſed, they goe proſperouſly forward, From Youghall this weeke letters came unto Conne, that the rebbels came up to the walls of Korke, and drove away the pray of the Towne, but my Lord Euſequeene and Sir Charles Uaverſon, my Lord preſident yet being ſick, followed them, recovered the Cattell, and kild eighty of them, that the young Lord Brahal, the youngeſt ſon of the Earl of Kork, made a road into Roaches Countrey, and there kild 400. or 500. of the rebels.</p>
            <p>That the ſecond ſon, the Lord Killinmekey, being at Band ſent out a ſquadron of Horſe, upon ſome deſigne up into Carbory, the rebels laid an Ambuſh and tooke 14. of them upon quarter, but no ſooner poſſeſſed of their bodies, but they cut their throats under their tongue rootes, and pulled out their tongues thorough it, otherſome they pulled their eyes out, no ſooner was this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous crueltie committed, but upon notice given to my Lord Tillinmequie, he preſently ſallied forth, with the ſtrength he could make, the Rebels fled to ſome great Caſtle, and he purſued them, broke in, and kild 400. of them, And Muskerry himſelfe as it is adviſed eſcaped from them, with great difficultie.</p>
            <p>That the Count of Kinſale is revolted, and that thoſe Engliſh that were in it are all Butchered.</p>
            <p>From the North we heare the Scots are landed 4000. ſtrong and are marching to the Newry, and Sir Henry Tiſhbourne on foot, with his armie towards the Navon, where it is ſaid the rebell makes great head.</p>
            <p>This day, thankes be unto God, part of our Army in this towne, which marched out yeſterday morning with two great pieces of Ordnance, a demicannon and Demiculverin are all ſafely returned from a Caſtle called Loiſleipe, being one ſir Nicholas Whites who hath beene theſe two moneths in the Caſtle of Dublin, there the Rebel had made himſelfe very ſtrong, being but ſix miles off us, and accounted to be one of the greateſt Caſtles for ſtrength in our parts, and accommodated with a moſt advantagious helpe of wood and river adjoyning unto it, yet nevertheleſſe after diſcharge of ſome forty great ſhot in the darke of the night by the helpe of ſeverall advantages, our men not being able to hinder their flight, they all ſtole away and left us the Caſtle, which is made a garriſon, fifty ſouldiers left there, Sir Charles Coot ſtill at the Naſſe, and hath done ſeverall ſervices there abouts ſince our armies comming home, one day laſt week the Rebell tooke a Bog, his men ſtript themſelves of their breeches, and followed the Rebels into the Bog, there kild an hundred of them, as I was credibly told by a Lieutenant yeſterday that was in that skirmiſh, and they Recovered that time 300. head of Cattell, the Almighty God proſper and continue theſe happy progreſſions; I remaine with my prayers for the eſtabliſhment of true peace, and ſetled Unitie amongſt them.</p>
