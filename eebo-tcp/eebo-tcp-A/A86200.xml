         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

From the <hi>Hague</hi> in HOLLAND to the Kings Maieſty reſiding at <hi>Yorke.</hi> Sent from the Hague by one
of her Maieſties Gentlemen Uſhers, <date>March 19. 1641.</date>
            </head>
            <p>THE memory of your Royall perſon, and the due obedience which I owe unto your Majeſty, have
reſpectively induced us to commend our Devotion unto you; But the Feares and Jealouſies fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
betwixt your Parliament and your Majeſty, have at the firſt audience affrighted us, to our great
griefe and aſtoniſhment: Yet be ſtill conſtant (my Liege) to lenity and patience, and doubt not but God in
his good time will right all iniuries reflected on you: We confeſſe your paſſion at our departure, with which
we likewiſe did mutually ſympathize, but ſince that former paſſion is reduplicated by new acerbities, we are
alſo poſſeſſed with the greateſt part of the ſame. Our entertainement here at <hi>Holland</hi> was firſt very Noble, but
of late we perſpicuouſly ſee, that the Dutch liberality is much extenuated, notwithſtanding the Princes gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity
is ſtill royally contributed to Us daily. The States of <hi>Holland</hi> doe not well accord with the Prince,
which hath oftentimes grieved and perplexed Our thoughts; they intend to create a new Officer over the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
and will truſt the Prince no longer for the payment of the Money, which greatly troubleth and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his Highneſſe: But we have laboured to the higheſt extent of our power to compoſe that variance and
diſ-union betweene them both: And ſince we finde theſe diſtractions, feares and Jealouſies, to aſſimulate and
comply with thoſe in <hi>England,</hi> wee are fully reſolved to returne againe with expedition, and you may ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
expect Us at <hi>Yorke,</hi> where we intend to be perhaps ſooner then you imagine. In the meane time (deare
Husband) conſolate your ſelfe with clemencie, and let not too deepe a paſſion conquer your captive thoughts
for by that meanes you will both unload your heart of ſorrow, and elevate your minde with innocencie.</p>
            <p>Our pious cogitations have beene daily invocated on the divine Providence for your ſecure proſperity, and
our ſollicitous indulgencie for our deare Sonne, and other children hath been ſo carefull, that we were never
forgetfull of either. The ſuppoſed danger of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> is now almoſt ended. But we heare for
certainty and by credible information, that our Couſin the King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> is ſet forward with a Fleet for
<hi>England,</hi> his intent God knowes: That our royall Brother likewiſe the King of <hi>France,</hi> with the King of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> and the States of <hi>Venice</hi> are in a preparation of a great Navie, but God of his infinite mercy prevent
the effuſion of bloud, that the Branches of peace and tranquility may not ſpring from a bloudy root. For our
owne part, we condole in a ſerious deploration the diſtractions and confuſion of thoſe Kingdomes, and doe
confirme our former reſolution, intending to viſit your Maieſty ſuddenly, being reſolved either to live or dye
at your ſacred feet, and in your owne Kingdome.</p>
