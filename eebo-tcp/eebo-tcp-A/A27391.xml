         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ACCOUNT
OF
The moſt Remarkable Paſſages in
IRELAND, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IN <hi>December</hi> laſt, the Proteſtants of <hi>Ireland</hi> had very great
expectation of an Army ſuddenly to be ſent over into that
Kingdom for their Relief, and were privately arming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and ſecuring what Ammunition they could to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
to join with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces, aſſoon as they ſhould
land; and to make the People more earneſt to put themſelves in a
poſture of defence, in caſe the Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> the then Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty,
ſhould offer any violence to them, there was by way of
Letter a Relation given from ſome Perſons of Note in the North
to two or three Lords in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and to ſeveral Perſons of Quality
throughout the Kingdom, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were generally to riſe on
the <hi>9th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> with intent to maſſacre and totally deſtory
the whole Body of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and all of the Proteſtant Religion in
that Kingdom. Theſe Letters did ſo run about the Nation, that
in few days all the Proteſtants were upon their defence, and every
private man making his Houſe a Garriſon, by keeping great and
ſtrong Guards in the Night-time, inſomuch that if their neareſt
Relations had come to viſit after night, they were anſwered out
of Caſements, Spike-holes, or Windows, with Blunder buſſes on Guns
at their breaſts, to know their buſineſs: And particularly on the
<hi>9th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> (as is mention'd before) it was credibly reported,
that there was not a Proteſtant in the whole Kingdom, but was
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99372:3"/>
on his Guard that whole Night in his own reſpective Dwelling, or
joined with ſome Neighbours in ſome ſort of ſtrength. The Earl
<hi>Tyrconnel</hi> finding the whole Kingdom in this great Conſternation,
ſent to ſome of the Gentlemen in <hi>Dublin,</hi> who had received this
Advice, and aſſured them with Oaths and Execrations, That there
was no ſuch thing intended againſt the Proteſtants; but being
doubtful that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of that Nation had but very ſmall regard
to his Oaths, did call a grand Council, in order to propoſe ſome
way to appeaſe the people: The reſult of which was, That a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
ſhould be immediately iſſued out, commanding all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to repair to their reſpective Dwellings, aſſuring them that no
injury was intended againſt them, making it penal for any man
afterward to deſert his own Houſe, or aſſociate himſelf with any
riotous people in any Garriſon-Town or ſtrong Houſes. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all theſe fair Promiſes and Threats, the people were
ſo univerſally alarmed by theſe Circular Letters (whether true or
falſe) that they daily joined themſelves in greater Numbers, and
many of them went into <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and the <hi>Iſle of Man</hi> for
ſafety, carrying with them what they conveniently could. The
Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> obſerving the humour of the people, and how
apprehenſive they were of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cruelty, and likewiſe being
informed of the vaſt number of people daily leaving <hi>Dublin,</hi> and
many conſiderable Merchants and Houſe-keepers lying at <hi>Rings-End</hi>
for a Wind to carry them off, ſent the Earl of <hi>Roſcommon</hi> and
the Lord <hi>Mountjoy</hi> to <hi>Rings-End</hi> to diſcourſe to the people, and
endeavour to prevail with them to return to their own Dwellings,
and follow their Employments; but what they ſaid either at <hi>Rings-End,</hi>
or elſewhere, made no greater impreſſion on the minds of the
people than the former Proclamations he had iſſued out, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
his Excellency to redouble his Oaths, and burn ſome Hats
and Wigs, that being his accuſtomed way of appeaſing his rage
and paſſion: during all this time, the people having advice of the
great Succeſs of his preſent Majeſty againſt the late King <hi>James</hi>'s
Forces, were encouraged to appear more bare-fac'd; and they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in greater Bodies than formerly in <hi>Munſter, Connaght,</hi> and
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> and the Proteſtants of <hi>Leinſter</hi> daily made their Eſcapes
into the North, leaving all their Subſtance to the diſpoſal of the
inſatiable ravenous <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who would impudently in the day-time
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99372:3"/>
drive Horſes and Cows, with thouſands of Sheep, from the Owners
thereof before their faces, who dared not to ask them what they
did; and the Proteſtants of the Counties of <hi>Dublin, Eaſt-Meath,
Weſt-Meath, Longford, Lowth,</hi> and the upper part of the County
of <hi>Cavan,</hi> being the greateſt Sufferers, repaired with this great loſs
quietly to the North, eſteeming it the Mercy of God that they
eſcaped with their lives. The very great Succeſs of his preſent
Majeſty, and the Late King's abdicating his Kingdom, ſo much
encouraged the Proteſtants, that then they began to appear in great
Bodies of Horſe and Foot, and take poſſeſſion of Towns and Forts,
and declare their deſign. And now being <hi>Londonderry</hi> and <hi>Inis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>killing</hi>
were the firſt that ſhut their Gates againſt the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> it's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that I give an account of them, before I proceed to ſpeak
of other places of the ſame Country.</p>
            <p>The News of his preſent Majeſty's deſign in landing an Army in
<hi>England,</hi> did ſo alarm the Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> that he very ſpeedily
put what Forces was then in Arms, into ſuch Garriſons as he
thought fit; but it ſeems, upon ſome Orders from the Late King
<hi>James,</hi> two Regiments of Foot, and one of Dragoons, were to be
forthwith ſent into <hi>England;</hi> whereupon his Excellency gave Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
for the Regiment of Foot, quartered in <hi>Londonderry,</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Lord <hi>Mountjoy,</hi> to march up to <hi>Dublin,</hi> in order for their
embarquing for <hi>England,</hi> which was accordingly marcht to <hi>Dublin,</hi>
and a new Regiment belonging to the Earl of <hi>Antrim,</hi> newly raiſed,
was ordered to march into <hi>Londonderry,</hi> to ſecure that Garriſon
(the ſame being left to the Government of the Townſmen and
Inhabitants of that place) but whether it was, that theſe new Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies
looked ſo dreadfully ſtarved, or the Townſmen had an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to keep Popery out, they ſhut the Gates of the Town on
the appearance of this new Regiment, and utterly denied them
entrance; but ſome of the Officers being deſirous to go into the
Town, the Inhabitants allowed them that priviledge, and upon
ſome debate the Inhabitants declared, they would ſecure the Garriſon
for the King and their own Preſervation, and ſent the Gentlemen out
with this Anſwer to the Earl of <hi>Antrim.</hi> This coming by an Expreſs to
his Excellency, and conſidering how indiſcreetly he had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the whole Regiment to march out of the Garriſon before others
were ordered to poſſeſs that place, he burned another Wigg, and then
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99372:4"/>
thought to retake that ſtrong Hold with about 6 Companies of the
Lord <hi>Mountjoy</hi>'s Regiment with Pike and Musket, who were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
three days after their arrival at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and after a long March
of 110 miles, being the depth of Winter, ordered to march back
again; but indeed it was altogether needleſs, until the Lord
<hi>Mountjoy</hi> came in Perſon, and propoſed to the Inhabitants. That if
they would admit of any of the Army to quarter in that Town,
he would disband all the Papiſts in thoſe ſix Companies, and put
Proteſtants in their places, and that Colonel <hi>Robert Lundy</hi> ſhould
be their Governour; to which the whole Town agreed, and
after that time there were ſix Companies of Proteſtants belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Lord <hi>Mountjoy,</hi> who are now it that place, and Colonel
<hi>Lundy</hi> continued Governour until of late.</p>
            <p>The little Town of <hi>Iniskilling</hi> being ſituated in an Iſland in a
great Lake, ſo that there was no acceſs but by water, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
thereof did no leſs gallantly ſecure that place, oppoſing two
Foot-Companies which were ſent by the Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> to ſecure
that Garriſon, looking on it as a moſt advantageous place bordering
on <hi>Connaght;</hi> but not timing his Intrigue well, the Inhabitants of
<hi>Iniskilling</hi> never ſuffered theſe two Companies to come nearer than
two miles of the Town, and ſo ſent them back again with as
much ſhame as the Earl of <hi>Antrim</hi>'s Regiment left <hi>Londonderry,</hi>
and very ſoon after the ſaid Town of <hi>Iniskilling</hi> declared for the
Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (the now King) and the Proteſtant Religion,
and have very gallantly ever ſince defended that place with great
Courage and Zeal, altho' they were like to have been ſurpriſed
by ſome of the diſaffected Gentlemen in that Country ſeveral
times. Since which time this Town has not been idle; for after
the Army had marched againſt the Counties of <hi>Downe, Antrim,</hi> &amp;c.
under the Command of Lieutenant General <hi>Hamilton</hi> and Colonel
<hi>Sheldon,</hi> the Lord <hi>Galmoy</hi> with about 2000 Horſe and Foot, was
ordered to march againſt this place, and the Country thereabouts
being boggy, and very bad way to bring great Guns againſt the
place, there was a contrivance of a Tin Gun covered with Leather,
and this was drawn by eight Horſes to the Top of a Hill near the
Town: After this great Bugbear (for ſo it might be term'd) was
fairly planted againſt the Town, the Lord <hi>Galmoy</hi> ſends a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
with a Summons for ſurrendring the Garriſon, offering large
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99372:4"/>
Conditions, but the Town refuſed him Entrance, and ſet his
Lordſhip and his great Gun at defiance (not knowing but the
ſame was real) and ſallied out in the Night, killed about thirty ſix,
took ſome Priſoners, and this extream weighty Gun, which one
man triumphantly brought into Town on his ſhoulder, that was
drawn by eight Horſes the day before. This Defeat ſo much
ſhamed the Lord and his Party, that they drew off, and never
troubled the place more, nor dare they ever ſince come near the
Town, but permit the Souldiers of it to ride thirty or forty miles
in the beſt planted Countries, driving before them ſuch Cattle, and
bringing ſuch Proviſions as they think moſt convenient for the
uſe of the Garriſon, without the leaſt obſtruction.</p>
            <p>When the Lord <hi>Galmoy</hi> was on his March towards <hi>Iniskilling</hi>
with his Tin Gun, he happened to take one <hi>Wolſton Dixie,</hi> eldeſt
Son to the Dean of <hi>Kilmore,</hi> and one <hi>Edward Charleton,</hi> as they
were carrying off ſome Concerns of the Dean's; and this young
Gentleman coming but newly from the Colledge, and being with
a Party of Horſe, the Lord <hi>Galmoy</hi> ſaid he was a Captain, and
inſtrumental in making ſo much trouble in the North; the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
diſowned it, and ſaid he only was ſecuring his Father's
Goods; but in ſhort, he and Mr. <hi>Charleton</hi> were hanged at <hi>Beltur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet;</hi>
and there being an accident, either by the breaking of the
Rope, or the Gate whereon they were hanged, this young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
fell down alive, and then the Queſtion was put, Whether he
would turn Roman Catholick, and pray for King <hi>James?</hi> He ſaid
he would not alter his Opinion, but would pray for the King:
Whereupon Command was given to hang him up again, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
half dead, was cut down, his Head and Mr. <hi>Charleton</hi>'s being
kicked about the ſtreets, and afterwards fixed on the Market-houſe.
This piece of Cruelty was done by that Bloody Villain the Lord
<hi>Galmoy</hi> at <hi>Belturbet</hi> in the County of <hi>Cavan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Towns of <hi>Londonderry</hi> and <hi>Iniskilling</hi> had thus oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> and his Proclamations, the County of
<hi>Cavan</hi> being the neighbouring County, began to appear very
briskly; for on the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> there being a Quarter-Seſſions
to be held at the Town of <hi>Cavan,</hi> and there alſo being many <hi>Iriſh</hi>
Juſtices of the Peace on the Bench, one Captain <hi>Robert Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
of <hi>Caſtle Sanderſon,</hi> came with about eighty Horſe into that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99372:5"/>
Town. After the Country had met, this Gentleman demanded
of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Juſtices to ſhew by what Commiſſion they ſat there?
They replied, It was by King <hi>James</hi> his Commiſſion; whereupon
Captain <hi>Sanderſon</hi> told them, That was no good Authority at that
time of day, and ordered the Country to return to their own
Dwellings; ſome of the <hi>Reilys,</hi> being Great men of that Country,
and Juſtices of the Peace, began to thwart him, which Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
had been ended by the Captain's Cane, if the Juſtice had not
fled off the Bench, and eſcaped his Fury; this ſo alarmed the whole
Court and Town, that the Quarter-Seſſions were broke up, and
none kept there ever ſince. This News went very ſoon to the
Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s Ears, who threatned to ſend ſome Troops of
Horſe into that Rebellious Country (as 'twas then termed) which
ſo much terrified the people, that almoſt every man was in Arms.
The <hi>Iriſh</hi> then began even to break and plunder Houſes in Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration-Towns,
and take away the Proteſtants Goods at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>Not long after this, one <hi>Sir Gerrard Irwin</hi> having gone to
<hi>Dublin,</hi> was made Lieutenant Colonel to the Earl of <hi>Granard</hi>'s
Regiment of Horſe to be then raiſed, and in order to the better
raiſing of the ſame in the County of <hi>Fermanagh,</hi> the ſaid Sir <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard</hi>
brought with him ſeveral Caſes of Piſtols, Holſters, and other
Furniture, with Carbines, Swords, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from <hi>Dublin,</hi> with Powder
and Ball, which did ſo much terrifie the hearts of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, that they reſolved to ſeize both the Knight and his Arms,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was accordingly done by one Mr. <hi>Dan. French</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Hen. Gwillyms,</hi> who came from <hi>Belturbet</hi> to the Town of <hi>Cavan</hi>
with about ſixty Horſe, and there ſeized on the Arms, and took
Sir <hi>Gerrard</hi> Priſoner to <hi>Belturbet,</hi> who was delivered to the Lord
<hi>Blany</hi>'s diſpoſal, being there at that time, upon his viewing the
Forces of that Country, who ſent Sir <hi>Gerrard</hi> Priſoner to <hi>Iniskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>
the Country wherein he purpoſed to raiſe his Men, to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
by them.</p>
            <p>This was not long from the Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s Ears (<hi>viz.</hi> that
the Proteſtants had broke the County-Goal at <hi>Cavan,</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
the Proteſtant Priſoners, who were hourly threatned to
have their Throats cut by the Papiſts in the ſaid Goal) who was
exceedingly troubled at it, but dared not to ſend any Forces into
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99372:5"/>
that Countrey, leſt they would be ſerved with the ſame ſauce,
as Sir <hi>Gerrard Irwin</hi> was: So that he did only ſend ſome
Troops of Horſe and Dragoons to <hi>Navan</hi> and <hi>Kells,</hi> in order
to prevent Captain <hi>Sanderſon</hi>'s Motion to <hi>Dublin</hi> with his
Horſe, being by this time alarm'd on the other ſide of his
Head by the Lord <hi>Mount Alexander,</hi> my Lord <hi>Blany,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur
Rawdon,</hi> and ſeveral other Perſons of Quality, being all up in
Arms in the Counties of <hi>Downe, Antrim,</hi> &amp;c. and having the Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Army but in a very bad Condition at that time (the beſt
whereof being ſent for <hi>England</hi> on the Prince's Landing) and few
or no New Men raiſed, ſeemed to be ſo apprehenſive of the
<hi>Scotch</hi> Army marching to <hi>Dublin,</hi> that he had Scouts for Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or Threeſcore Miles together, to obſerve the Motion of
the Rebels in the <hi>North</hi> (as he termed them), And it is
moſt certain, that if ſome Troops had marcht up towards
<hi>Dublin,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> would certainly either have fled,
or ſurrendred the Caſtle, not having above Ten Companies
of Foot, and ſome few Horſe in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and theſe being all
new rais'd raw Men. But the Gentlemen of the <hi>North,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they were in an indifferent Condition, and had a
great Deſire to effect this, yet were unwilling to appear any
otherwiſe than in their own Defence, until Commiſſions ſhould
come out of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> conſidering how numerous the <hi>Scotch</hi>
in the <hi>North</hi> were, and how weak and inſignificant the Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Army was, and how uſeleſs the Rabble of the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
would be to him, very cunningly engag'd the Lord <hi>Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy</hi>
to ſend Letters to his Friends in the <hi>North,</hi> to be very
careful of Affairs; aſſuring them, that no Forces ſhould be
ſent into the <hi>North,</hi> or any New Levies made, or Soldiers
quartered upon private Houſes; and that all things would be
very well, to their own ſatisfaction; for, that he was going into
<hi>France,</hi> to receive Orders from King <hi>James,</hi> to make <hi>Tyrcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi>
lay down the Sword. This ſo much pleaſed the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that all things began to grow pretty ſtill and quiet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
in which time the Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> was raiſing Men,
and ſending Arms, privately into the Countrey, to ſuch as he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99372:6"/>
had given Commiſſion; and in a very ſhort time, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
his Promiſes to the Lord <hi>Mountjoy,</hi> had Raiſed
and Armed ſeveral Regiments of Dragoons, and Foot, and
ſecured the Town of <hi>Newry,</hi> being a great Paſs, and very
diſadvantageous to the Proteſtants in the <hi>Norths.</hi> The <hi>Iriſh</hi>
having ſecured this Paſs of <hi>Newry,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> thought
himſelf very ſafe, and then daily ſent down Arms to all that
Countrey, and ſecured the Towns of <hi>Drogheda</hi> and <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalke,</hi>
by leaving great Parties both of Horſe and Foot in
them. So that the Proteſtants had no manner of Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that way; and likewiſe had taken care, that all other
By-Paſſes cunningly ſhould be ſecured; which was the only
miſchief the Proteſtants met with; for by this means the
Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> could march down his Army againſt them
when he pleaſed, and at his own leiſure, and they never have
the leaſt Account of their Motion, which has proved too true,
as you ſhall hear hereafter.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> having got this Conſiderable Strength (as I
have mentioned before), then it was their Buſineſs, and
indeed the poſitive Commands from the Reſpective Pariſh-Prieſts,
and under the Danger of a Curſe too, That they
ſhould endeavour to ſecure and ſeize all ſtrong Caſtles, or
Gentlemens Houſes of any Strength, as ſoon as poſſible they
could, which indeed they effected with much Integrity, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by cunningly ſtealing into them by Nights, or ſetting
Fire to their Gates.</p>
            <p>While the Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> was fortifying the <hi>Newry,</hi>
and re-enforcing ſeveral other Garriſons, there were ſeveral
Odd Companies of Foot, and Troops of Dragoons quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about the Countrey, who indeed were willing to be
gone from amongſt the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army; and amongſt the reſt,
(I cannot paſs by giving you an Account of the Troop
of Dragoons quartered in <hi>Armagh</hi>) it ſeems Lieutenant <hi>Aſpoll,</hi>
commanding in Chief in that Town, perceiving how vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
numerous the Proteſtants were in that Countrey, and
how vigorouſly they armed themſelves, was apprehenſive of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99372:6"/>
ſome Danger; therefore gave private Orders to all the Men
to be ready againſt a certain Hour, and march out of the
Garriſon with all the Privacy imaginable. But this was not
ſo ſecretly managed, but it took Wind in the Town, and
the very morning the Dragoons were to march away, the
Townſmen ſurprized the Officers in their Chambers, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
all the Horſes and Arms they could find; and there
being about Ten of the Dragoons on the Guard that Night,
poſted themſelves in the <hi>Seſſion-Houſe,</hi> and endeavoured to
ſecure that Place; but the Townſmen were ſo forward and
reſolute, that they came up to the Doors of the Houſe, fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on both ſides very ſmartly: But at laſt the Dragoons
ſurrendered, after a Serjeant was ſhot in the Arm, and they
with the reſt of the Troop, all ſent Priſoners to the Church,
after having loſt both Horſe and Arms, which were diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
amongſt the Men who performed this Service; and the
Dragoons after ſome Days Confinement, Diſcharg'd, who
upon their March in the County of <hi>Lowth,</hi> got near the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of all their Horſe and Arms at Captain <hi>Blany</hi>'s Houſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken all his beſt Horſes and Houſhold-Goods, to a very
conſiderable Value.</p>
            <p>This late Action at <hi>Armagh</hi> much ſtir'd up his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy's
Paſſion; inſomuch, that he ſwore, he would ſend down
a very powerful Army againſt the <hi>North;</hi> but being awed by
a conſiderable Force under the Lord <hi>Inchiqueen,</hi> in <hi>Munſter,</hi> and
by another under the Lord <hi>Kingſton</hi> in <hi>Connaught,</hi> durſt not ſend ſo
great an Army as he would; and therefore for ſome time reſted
quiet.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Northern</hi> Gentlemen underſtanding, that the Earl of
<hi>Tyrconnel</hi> did not intend an Army to divert them, ſo ſoon as
expected, were willing to give themſelves ſome Recreation;
and the taking of <hi>Carrickfergus</hi> (where the Earl of <hi>Antrim</hi>
was Governour, and <hi>Mark Talbot,</hi> Natural Son to the Earl
of <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> Commander of the Forces there) was the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
and it was reported on all hands, That if there had not
been a Miſ-management in the Matter, the Deſign had taken
Effect; but ſince it did not, I ſhall not trouble the Reader with
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99372:7"/>
a Relation of the manner of beſieging that Town, or how they
left it.</p>
            <p>After the Forces were drawn back which went againſt the
Town of <hi>Carrickfergus,</hi> the Council at <hi>Hilburragh</hi> thought
convenient to ſend ſome Forces to ſecure the Paſs at <hi>Logh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricklan,</hi>
and other places thereabouts, lying within ſome few
Miles of <hi>Newry,</hi> where the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had made a conſiderable
Strength, both by manning the Bridge, and intrenching the
Town; and at <hi>Armagh</hi> the Lord <hi>Blany,</hi> with about a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
of Horſe, and a Regiment of Foot, ſecured that Paſs,
in caſe the Enemy ſhould move that way. Things being
ordered in this manner, there happened ſeveral Skirmiſhes both
between the Enemy at <hi>Newry,</hi> and that part of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Army at <hi>Loghbricklan,</hi> in ſome part of which a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
worthy Gentleman, one Captain <hi>Poe,</hi> was ſlain, with
about Nine more, as they went a Forraging, by an Ambuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade;
as alſo ſeveral Skirmiſhes between the Lord <hi>Blany</hi>'s Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the Enemy at <hi>Charlimount,</hi> and other flying Parties
who were Pillaging the Countrey: So that ſcarcely a Day
paſſed without killing and taking ſome. This being about
the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> things arrived to a very great
pitch, and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> grew more inſolent than formerly: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that many People fled from their Concerns, leaving
all, or moſt of their Subſtance behind, to the diſpoſal of the
Enemy, and grew almoſt impatient for Relief out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
expecting every fair Wind would bring over an Army,
which would ſettle that Kingdom: And indeed a very ſmall
Number of Men, with Arms and Ammunition, might have
effected it, when the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (the now King) his
Proclamation came over, requiring the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to ſurrender them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and their Arms by the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>April:</hi> Which Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
was ſent by the Lord <hi>Blany</hi> to the Garriſon of <hi>Charli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount:</hi>
And the ſaid Lord <hi>Blany</hi> had his Majeſty Proclaimed
at <hi>Armagh,</hi> with all the Solemnity imaginable, which was
likewiſe done at <hi>Hillsburrough,</hi> and ſeveral other Places in the
<hi>North.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> had advice, That our Preſent
King <hi>William</hi> was proclaimed in <hi>Armagh,</hi> and ſeveral other
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99372:7"/>
places, he by this time had put his Army into ſome better
Condition than before, and ordered ſome Horſe and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons,
commanded by Collonel <hi>Dominick Sheldon,</hi> with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Body of Foot, commanded by Collonel <hi>Richard Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi>
(who was ſent out of <hi>England,</hi> with Conditions for the
<hi>Iriſh</hi>) to march towards the <hi>North:</hi> And having ſtopt all
Correſpondence from the Proteſtants, from <hi>Newry</hi> downwards,
that Army marched within ſome few Miles of <hi>Loghbricklan,</hi>
before any particular Account came to the Lord <hi>Mount Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
or the Council at <hi>Hillsburrough:</hi> Whereupon it was
thought fit to withdraw what Forces were quartered at <hi>Logh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricklan,</hi>
and thereabouts, nearer <hi>Drumore</hi> and <hi>Hillsburrough,</hi>
and to burn and deſtroy all the Countrey they marched
through, to make the ſame uneaſie for the Earl of <hi>Tyrcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi>'s
Horſe, in regard there was not much Forrage in that
Countrey. However, Collonel <hi>Hamilton</hi> and <hi>Sheldon</hi> finding
the Garriſon of <hi>Loghbricklan</hi> deſerted, immediately moved
forward; and having ſome Troops in the Forlorn, marched
within ſome few Miles of <hi>Drumore:</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Rawdon</hi> then
commanding at <hi>Drumore,</hi> ſent out ſome Scouts, to obſerve
the Motion of the Enemy, and to diſcover their Number:
The Scouts informed him, that there could not be above Three
or Four Troops of Horſe, and that they approached near the
Town: Whereupon Sir <hi>Arthur Rawdon</hi> drew out about Five
Hundred Men, or thereabouts, to prevent the Enemies coming
farther into that Countrey) and upon View of the Body of
Horſe (the reſt of the Army lying obſcurely under a great
Hill), reſolved to Charge them; but before there was any
Cloſe Engagement, the great Army which lay ſecure behind
the Hill, moved forward, and were much too ſtrong for Sir
<hi>Arthur</hi>'s Party: Whereupon the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> fled, and made their
way through <hi>Hillsburrough,</hi> the Enemy killing ſeveral, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the purſuit of them for about Five or Six Miles, and
getting great Plunder of Rich Portmantions, and other things
left on the way; but finding themſelves near <hi>Hillsburrough,</hi> and
not knowing but the Body of the Proteſtant Army were in
a Reſerve thereabouts, thought it convenient to make a Halt
until they had brought up the reſt of the Army. But to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99372:8"/>
give Sir <hi>Arthur Rawdon</hi> his due, he behaved himſelf with as
much Courage as any Man could do in this Engagement;
and had there been but reaſonable Odds, he and Major <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi>
now one of the Governours of <hi>Londonderry,</hi> had defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Enemy; But the loſs of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> was not much
(conſidering the advantage of the purſuit the Enemy might have
made) loſing about 100.</p>
            <p>Upon the News of this, moſt of the People about <hi>Hillsbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>
fled; but ſome kept the Caſtle, being a place of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
good Strength, and having about a Thouſand Pound
in Money, and an incredible Store of Oatmeal, and other
Proviſion, were reſolved to defend the Place; but in a very
little time ſurrendred it, and all the Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the Enemy,
Col. <hi>Hamilton</hi> and <hi>Sheldon</hi> giving Protections to all People who
deſired them, on his March, which was their Policy; for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
many remained in their own Houſes.</p>
            <p>After the Break of <hi>Drumore,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Rawdon</hi> brought what
Horſe and Foot he could with him to <hi>Colerain;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
what Forces were in <hi>Liſnegarvy, Belfaſt, Antrim,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places thereabouts, made their way to that Garriſon, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſecure that Paſs, and prevent the Enemy going over the
<hi>Ban</hi> Water, having cut down the Bridge at <hi>Porteglanone,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Ten Miles from <hi>Colerain,</hi> and ordered all the Boats on <hi>Lough
Neagh,</hi> and the River to be burnt, which was eſteemed the only
way to retard the Enemies March into the County of <hi>Londonderry</hi>
and <hi>Donegall</hi> (having no way to paſs but by a tedious march by
<hi>Charlimount</hi>): But the great overſight of not ſinking or burning
theſe Boats, proved very fatal, as you ſhall hear hereafter.</p>
            <p>The Garriſon at <hi>Hillburrough</hi> being ſurrendred, and all the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi>
Forces making their way to <hi>Colerain,</hi> there was nothing left to
oppoſe the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army in all that Country, where they got very
great Plunder, eſpecially in <hi>Liſnegarvy, Belfaſt</hi> and <hi>Antrim,</hi> beſides
to the value of 3 or 4000 <hi>l.</hi> belonging to the Lord <hi>Maſſereen</hi> in
Money and Plate, hid about his Houſe, and diſcovered by his own
Servant, for a Reward of 10 Guinies; and beſides this, they got all
the Furniture of his Houſe, as it ſtood, to a very great value: And
in this plentiful Country the Enemy thought fit for ſome time to
refreſh themſelves, which indeed they did.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:99372:8"/>
Now I muſt return to <hi>Armagh, Monaghar</hi> and <hi>Glaſslogh,</hi> to give
account of the Forces there, under the Command of the Lord <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
and the other Forces of the Counties of <hi>Cavan</hi> and <hi>Fermanaugh,</hi>
commanded by Capt. <hi>Francis Hamilton,</hi> now Sir <hi>Francis Hamilton,</hi>
who for the good of his Country and Religion, deſerted the late King
<hi>James</hi>'s Army, and brought off about 16 or 20 of the beſt Men in
his Troop, and forced his way, eſcaping ſeveral <hi>imminent</hi> dangers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> of the <hi>North-Weſt</hi> having advice, that the Army had
conquered all before them in the <hi>North-Eaſt</hi> Country, very vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
preſt the taking in of ſtrong Houſes and Caſtles: wherefore
the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> thought good to make a fair Eſcape to <hi>Iniskilling,</hi>
where many of them now are, to the number of about 10000 of
good Men, under the command of <hi>Guſtavus Hamilton,</hi> ſome time
Cornet to the Lord <hi>Galmoy;</hi> and many of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> got into
the Caſtle of <hi>Monaghan;</hi> but the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were ſo numerous about that
place, and ſo very earneſt in getting it, that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were
forced to deſert it, and make to <hi>Glaſslogh;</hi> But this was no reſting
place for them long; for one <hi>John Macanna</hi> came againſt it with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
600 Men, and intended to have ſeized the Lady <hi>Blany,</hi> and
ſome other Perſons of Quality in the Caſtle, if <hi>Matthew Auctle,</hi> Eſq;
a perſon of undaunted courage, had not drawn out what Forces
were in that ſmall Village, conſiſting not of above Two Troops of
Horſe, and Three Companies of Foot, to fight the Enemy, who
advantageouſly lined a large Fort on the Top of a Hill, and gauled
the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> as they advanced; but this Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Auctle,</hi>
very bravely forced his way into the Fort, notwithſtanding their
Fire, and put them to the rout, where there was about 89 kill'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<hi>Macanna</hi> himſelf, his Son, and another Son taken Priſoner; and
immediately after this paſſage a Rogue lay behind a Buſh; and ſhot
Mr. <hi>Auctle</hi> dead, being the only perſon loſt in this Skirmiſh. But
the Enemy being thus routed, the Lady <hi>Blany,</hi> and the other perſons
in the Caſtle, with the Two Troops and Three Foot Companies, had
afair opportunity of making their Eſcape, and quitting that place,
made their way to <hi>Londonderry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then what Forces were left in this Country, were at <hi>Armagh</hi>
with the Lord <hi>Blany,</hi> to ſecure that Frontier Garriſon; but Coll.
<hi>Lundy</hi> not ſending any Men to re-enforce the place, as was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the Enemy in a manner ſurrounding the Town, before the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99372:9"/>
Lord <hi>Blany</hi> would ſtir, or quit it, was at length forced to make his
way to <hi>Colerain,</hi> with about 7 Troops of Horſe, and 8 Companies
of Foot, with which his Lordſhip did narrowly eſcape; for the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons
of <hi>Charlimount</hi> and <hi>Mountjoy,</hi> having notice of his March, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
about 1200 Men, on the <hi>16th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> to get the Paſs at
<hi>Ardea-Bridge;</hi> and if that was done, 500 more were to fall on in
the Rear, and ſo deſtroy the whole Party; but my Lord marching
his Men in good order, and with all the ſpeed he could, by good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
got the Bridge, not a quarter of an hour before the Enemy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
and fired in the Rear: Whereupon the Horſe and Foot were
drawn up, and about Two Companies ſent out for the <hi>Forlorn,</hi> to the
<hi>Bridge,</hi> to make a handſome Engagement of it; but the Enemy at
the very firſt Fire ran. Upon which the Horſe fell on, and killed
about 155, as was then found on the ſpot, beſides ſeveral that were
drowned: And in this Exploit there was not a man killed or wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the Lord <hi>Blany</hi>'s Party, nor any harm done, ſave Two Horſes
loſt; ſo that Party marched forward to <hi>Colerain.</hi> There was Seven
Companies of Foot more which belonged to the Lord <hi>Blany;</hi> but
they thinking to make a nearer way to <hi>Colerain,</hi> were all diſarmed
near <hi>Antrim,</hi> and no other harm done them, as I gave you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
before. About this time 8000 Arms, and 500 Barrels of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
with 550 <hi>l.</hi> for Coll. <hi>Lundy</hi>'s good Service, arrived at <hi>Derry,</hi>
which came moſt ſeaſonably for the uſe of the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> During
this Encounter, <hi>Hamilton</hi> and <hi>Sheldon</hi> were refreſhing their Men in
that plentiful Country; for it pleaſed them ſo well, that they did
not very eagerly preſs forward towards <hi>Colerain,</hi> until that Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
was made very ſtrong by great Bodies of Horſe and Foot of the
<hi>Proteſtants,</hi> coming daily to them: And the firſt thing the Enemy
did, was to ſecure all the Boats which were drawn up (as I formerly
told you), and then about Two Troops of Horſe came to view the
place, and went ſo near, that their Leader was ſhot by one from
the Garriſon, which cauſed the reſt to retreat, after they had taken
a good view of the Situation of the Town, and the Fortification of
it, being a Mud Wall of a conſiderable height, and a deep wet Ditch
round Three Parts of the Town, and the <hi>Ban</hi> Water, with a Draw-Bridge
on it, fortifying the other <hi>4th</hi> part. The Chief Commander
of the Place was Major <hi>Gaſtavus Hamilton,</hi> who did not ſpare any
charge or labour to make the Place tenable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:99372:9"/>
The Enemy having thus received the Garriſon, ſent word, that
they would give them a Viſit the next day about Ten a Clock; and
indeed they were as good as their promiſe; for about the ſame hour
they marched up with five Pieces of Cannon, three whereof they
planted againſt the Gate near the River, attended with a Body of
Dragoons, and the other two Guns were planted againſt King's-Gate,
attended by a Body of Horſe, and their Foot drawn up in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre:
They began to play very warmly at the Town, and the Town
as hotly at them; but there being many Hedges and Gardens near
the Works, the Enemies Foot got into them; which much preſerv'd
them from the Shot of the Town; as alſo did a Water-Mill very
near the Town, where about thirty or forty of the Granadeers got,
near night, and when they found there was no good to be done with
the Town, marched off their Foot in a ſhower of Snow, ſo that the
Town could not obſerve their motion; when the Foot were clearly
drawn off, the Dragoons followed, and then the Horſe marched;
but in ſuch confuſion and diſorder they were, that had the Town
ſallied out with ſome Troops of Houſe, and a brisk Party of Foot,
they certainly had ruined the Enemy, who were ſo terrify'd at a
great Body of Horſe, being the Lord <hi>Blany</hi>'s Regiment, and ſome
Foot drawn out on a Hill beyond the Town, that they dropt two
of their Cannon on the Road, with much of their Baggage and Lug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
and the next Morning came and brought them away, having
loſt about ſixty Men the day before, and ſeveral wounded; amongſt
whom, Sir <hi>Gregory Birne</hi> was ſhot in the Head, but recovered of the
Wound.</p>
            <p>The Enemy meeting with this Repulſe, contrary to expectation,
(for they really thought to get the Town on their firſt appearance)
marched back to <hi>Balymony, Balymenagh, Antrim,</hi> and other Towns
thereabouts: And now, ſince they could not paſs the <hi>Ban-water</hi> at
<hi>Colrain,</hi> and the Bridge at <hi>Portglanone</hi> being cut down, (as I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
before,) they make uſe of the Boats which ſhould have been
burned, and attempted in a few days to get over their Forces; but
there being ſome Troops of Horſe and Dragoons, and about two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
of Foot attending their motion, along the River-ſide, could
not eaſily make their way, Sir <hi>Arthur Rawdon</hi> taking ſuch great care
to prevent them: However, this matter was not long in diſpute;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99372:10"/>
for Col. <hi>Nugent</hi> (Son to the Earl of <hi>Weſt-meath</hi>) with about ſixty
Granadeers, on the 10th of <hi>April,</hi> before day, came over a little
above the Bridge of <hi>Portglanone</hi> in a Boat, and marched his men ſo
cloſe, and firing in ſuch good order, that he ſoon gained the Trench,
where about forty of the Proteſtants were, who deſerted the ſame
for want of Ammunition (as it was reported,) and then the reſt of
the Foot fled; <hi>Arthur Rawdon,</hi> Capt. <hi>James Magill,</hi> Capt. <hi>Dunbar,</hi> and
Capt. <hi>Henly</hi> ſtood, and charged <hi>Nugent</hi> and his ſixty men, (although
their men left them;) and diſputed the matter for a ſhort time,
where Capt. <hi>Magill</hi> was ſlain, and Capt. <hi>Henly</hi> deſperately wounded;
and then Sir <hi>Arthur,</hi> after a cloſe engagement with <hi>Nugent,</hi> the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
flying thick about him, was forced to retreat as gallantly as Col.
<hi>Nugent</hi>'s Attempt was great. The Buſineſs being over, on viewing
the Body of Capt. <hi>Henly,</hi> being ſtrangely mangled, Col. <hi>Nugent</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
him to move; and asking whether he was not dead, Capt.
<hi>Henly</hi> ſaid, he was not; and therefore deſired honourable Quarters,
which was given; and he ſent to the Hoſpital near <hi>Colrain,</hi> and well
recovered of his Wounds, by the particular Directions of Col. <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent;</hi>
and the Lord of <hi>Duntreath,</hi> either out of fear or vexation, that
the Army was broken, died at <hi>Kilmore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This News of the Enemies paſſing the River, coming to Col. <hi>Lun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
the Governor of <hi>London-Derry,</hi> he forthwith ordered all the Forces
at and about <hi>Colrain,</hi> to march into the <hi>Laggan,</hi> and to quit the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of <hi>Colrain,</hi> although it might have been kept for a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
time; but his Orders were obſerved, and all the Forces march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>London-Derry</hi> (burning and deſtroying all the Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Colrain</hi> and <hi>Derry,</hi> before them; where Col. <hi>Lundy</hi> aſſured the
Army that they ſhould fight the Enemy very ſoon; and to that end
a Proclamation was ſet forth, which very much encouraged both Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
and Soldiers.</p>
            <p>Within ſome few days the Enemy began to appear on the other
ſide of the River of <hi>Derry,</hi> which was not much regarded, or taken
notice of; but within two days the whole Army was obſerved to
march towards <hi>Strabawne,</hi> of which Col. <hi>Lundy</hi> had a full account,
and was adviſed, that the Enemy could not ſtay in that Country,
which was ruined before by the Proteſtant Army, and therefore muſt
of neceſſity preſs and force their way into the <hi>Laggan,</hi> being a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Countrey; wherefore Col. <hi>Lundy</hi> was deſired to march even with
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99372:10"/>
the Enemy on the one ſide of the River, that they may be at the
Paſſes as ſoon or ſooner than the Enemy; and if <hi>Lifford, Claydy</hi> and
<hi>Fin-Waters</hi> were ſecured, there was no danger of the Enemy get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
into that good Country, where the whole Army may be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
till Relief came out of <hi>England;</hi> but theſe Reaſons made no
ſound in his ears, or at leaſt ſeemed little to regard them, and ſuffered
the Enemy to have a days March before him; ſo that when he had
ordered ſome few Regiments of Foot to ſecure theſe Paſſes, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
whole Body were drawn up near theſe Places, and broke in at
<hi>Claydy</hi>-Ford, (whether upon a Sign from Col. <hi>Lundy</hi> or not, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
poſitively ſay,) and then Col. <hi>Lundy</hi> fled, crying out, <hi>You are
all cut off, ſhift for your ſelves;</hi> ſuffering about two hundred of the
Proteſtants to be cut off, he making his way to <hi>London-Derry,</hi> and
indeed the whole Regiment poſted at <hi>Lifford,</hi> had certainly been loſt,
had not ſome Gentlemen of greater Courage or more honeſty, made a
a halt with the Horſe, and brought up the Foot, after the loſs
of 100 of them; and then according to Col. <hi>Lundy</hi>'s Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
all the Army marched with what haſte they could to <hi>Derry;</hi>
but when they came there, the Gates were ſhut, and about 8000
kept out of the Walls, and diſperſed about the Country; ſo that if
the Enemy had purſued, all theſe poor Souls might have been loſt;
but as it was, many of them were loſt, for they made down to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhein,</hi>
where ſeveral of them were killed, as well by the Rabble of
the Country, as the Army, beſides getting a great many good Arms.</p>
            <p>When the Enemies Horſe and Foot, that were drawn up at <hi>Claydy,</hi>
obſerved the Proteſtants to run, the Horſe eagerly preſſed over, by
ſwimming the River, dragging the Foot by Tail and Mane after them,
very few being loſt, ſave only Major <hi>Robert Nangle,</hi> and two Troopers
drowned.</p>
            <p>The next day (and as all looked upon as a great Providence) Col.
<hi>Cunningham</hi> and Col. <hi>Richards</hi> appeared in <hi>Loghfoyle,</hi> about four miles
from the Town, with nine Sail and a Man of War, which brought
over two Regiments for the Relief of <hi>Derry:</hi> This indeed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
the People; but alas! it was to little purpoſe; for as ſoon as
Col. <hi>Cunningham</hi> and <hi>Richards</hi> came up to the Town, Col. <hi>Lundy</hi>
aſſured them there was not ten days Proviſion in the Garriſon; and
thereupon a Council of War was called, and 'twas concluded, that
the Town was not tenable, for want of Proviſions: Upon which,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99372:11"/>
               <hi>Cunningham</hi> and <hi>Richards</hi> immediately returned to their Men on board,
and waited two days to bring off Col. <hi>Lundy,</hi> leaving the Town to
make Conditions for themſelves, having before brought off moſt of
the conſiderable men of the Army, who, neither through fear, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection
to the Cauſe they had eſpouſed, left the Place, but meerly
cheated and deluded by this blind Council of War.</p>
            <p>This ſudden Reſolution of the Relief going back, amazed the Town,
and eſpecially thoſe who knew nothing of the Deſign, and the Town
being in a good condition, both as to Proviſion and a conſiderable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
both of Horſe and Foot in it, ſent three ſeveral Meſſengers to
Col. <hi>Cunningham</hi> and <hi>Richards,</hi> That if they would accept of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,
and ſecure it for Their preſent Majeſties, what Horſe and Foot
were in Town, would take the Field, and leave the Town to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
(for in that time they were in a condition to do it, but they
returned no Anſwer, nor did the Meſſengers return ever ſince,</p>
            <p>While Col. <hi>Cunningham</hi> and <hi>Richards</hi> were in the <hi>Logh,</hi> the late
King <hi>James</hi> marched all his Forces within a ſmall way of <hi>London-Derry,</hi>
and thought to get the Garriſon without the leaſt oppoſition;
but upon his approach, the Townſmen gave him a warm Salute with
their great Guns, and kill'd Three of his Horſe with a Cannon-Ball;
which put a ſtop to his Career. Col. <hi>Lundy</hi> obſerving how violent the
men were, ſent Col. <hi>Thomas Whitney</hi> round the Walls, to command
the men not to fire any more; which Orders the ſaid <hi>Whitney</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered;
but had he not made ſoon off, he had certainly been thrown
over the Walls: Col <hi>Lundy</hi> finding how reſolute the men were, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to let them take their own Meaſures; and within ſome few
hours after, the Earl of <hi>Abbercorne</hi> was ſent with a Parly from the
late King, for to ſurrender, permitting them their Lives, Eſtates, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and a free Pardon for all Offences paſt; but all this would not
work with the People, who utterly denied to ſurrender on any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
            <p>Col. <hi>Lundy,</hi> ſeeing this way would not do what he deſigned (as
the Town had ſtrong Preſumptions to believe,) it ſeems the Key of
the Ferry-Gate was loſt, and the Gun before the Gate uncharged, and
the Gunner not to be found; this being diſcovered, the whole Town
was allarm'd, and every man repair'd to the Wall, and Col <hi>Murray</hi>
appointed Governor that night, upon which, Col. <hi>Lundy</hi> ſecur'd
himſelf in his Houſe under a Guard of his own Red-coats, fearing the
Soldiers of the Town would uſe violence againſt him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:99372:11"/>
The next day, it appearing that Col. <hi>Lundy</hi> had abſconded, the
Town unanimouſly choſe Mr. <hi>George Walker</hi> Clerk, and Lieut. <hi>Hen.
Baker,</hi> their Governors, and Col. <hi>Murray</hi> the General in the Field
upon all Sallies. This Election mightily pleas'd the People, and were,
notwithſtanding Col. <hi>Cunningham</hi> and <hi>Richards</hi> had left them, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to defend the Place.</p>
            <p>Now there was a hot Diſcourſe in the Garriſon, that King <hi>James</hi>
was in perſon before the Town, and that if they would not believe
it, two Gent. who knew him, might go out and ſee: Whereupon,
Mr. Arch-deacon <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Nevil</hi> were appointed; who
returned not again to the Garriſon. Then another Paper came, under
the Hand and Seal of the late King, to deſire the Garriſon to ſend
out any number under Twenty, to ſee him; but Anſwer was return'd,
That whether he was there or not, the Town ſhould not be ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</p>
            <p>When the late King found himſelf thus ſlighted by the Town, he
did then tamper with Capt. <hi>Robert Galbreath,</hi> Capt. <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin
Adaire,</hi> for the Surrender of the Fort of <hi>Kilmore,</hi> which indeed
took effect; but before this, Col. <hi>Lundy,</hi> one <hi>Giluer Braſier,</hi> and
Lieut. <hi>Wildman,</hi> made their Eſcapes in Diſguiſe, and went down to
<hi>Kilmore,</hi> with <hi>Benjamin Adaire,</hi> who came for Powder to the Town,
and ſo got off to <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This News of the Surrender of <hi>Kilmore,</hi> was a ſecond Surprize to
the Town; but all this would not perſwade them to ſurrender, and
by this time moſt of the Horſe in the Town were forced to be turned
out for want of Forage, and only one hundred kept, being two
Troops, Col. <hi>Murray</hi> Capt. of the one, and <hi>Nathanael Bull</hi> Capt. of
the other: And now the Town being ſurrounded, they came to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
their Proviſion and Number of fighting Men, and upon ſearch,
it plainly appear'd there was Proviſion for 12000 men for ten or
twelve weeks: Whereupon the men were Regimented, and brought
to an Allowance, and have ever ſince moſt gallantly defended the
Place, their Sallies being frequent and brave. I will only ſay, That
by the prudent Government of theſe two Gentlement, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
by many in the Garriſon, the Town has been preſerved.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Munſter</hi> the Lord <hi>Inchequin</hi> commanded the Proteſtants; but
being ſurprized by Major General <hi>Macarty,</hi> were all diſarmed, and
no farther harm done them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:99372:12"/>
Before I proceed any farther to give an Account of the Town of
<hi>London-Derry,</hi> and the Situation of the Place, I muſt give a Relation
how that Honourable Perſon, the Lord <hi>Kingſton,</hi> with about 1000
Horſe and Foot, were decoyed out of the two ſtrong Forts at <hi>Sligoe,</hi>
which might very well have held out as long as <hi>Derry,</hi> and been a
great Relief to many of the Proteſtants in <hi>Connaught.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Col. <hi>Lundy,</hi> Governor of <hi>London-Derry,</hi> writes to this Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Perſon, to march his men to joyn the Proteſtants in the <hi>Laggan;</hi>
Upon this Letter, the Lord <hi>Kingſton</hi> accordingly marched his men as
far as <hi>Ballyſhannan</hi> and <hi>Donegall;</hi> but when his Lordſhip had come
that length, he had Advice, that there was no room for his men, or
Forage for his Horſe in <hi>London-Derry,</hi> and therefore deſired him to
ſhift for himſelf, and that his men might take the late King <hi>James</hi>'s
Protection. Upon which, the Lord <hi>Kingſton</hi> made for <hi>England,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
a French Veſſel that lay near <hi>Caſtledoe,</hi> and brought ſome of
his men with him, and the reſt got into <hi>Iniskilling:</hi> This carries the
Face of contrivance, in regard his Lordſhip was not able to make
his way to <hi>London-Derry,</hi> nor to return to <hi>Sligoe,</hi> the Enemy poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing
themſelves of thoſe Forts ſo ſoon as they were deſerted.</p>
            <p>And now I muſt return to <hi>London-Derry:</hi> As I have informed you
how the late King <hi>James</hi> uſed all means to get that Town, ſo there was
one Expedient more found out, (which was thus;) A Sham-Letter
was ſent into the Garriſon, That the Lord <hi>Kingſton</hi>'s Party had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
ſome of the Enemy at <hi>Fin-water,</hi> and routed them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
earneſtly preſſed the Governor to ſend 500 Foot, with twenty
Barrels of Powder to meet him about <hi>Raphoe,</hi> and that his Lordſhip
doubted not to repel the Enemy; but the Governors very
diſcreetly conſidering the unreaſonableneſs of that Letter, inaſmuch
as the greateſt part of the Iriſh Army lay between the Town and
<hi>Raphoe,</hi> looked upon it as a Trick to get the Powder and Arms; the
truth of which was afterwards made very plain, in regard the Lord
<hi>Kingſton</hi> had not writ any ſuch Letter, nor was he near that place,
or ever engaged any part of the Iriſh Army.</p>
            <p>The Town, by this time, was very well allarm'd by the approach
of the Enemy, and having an Account of a conſiderable quantity of
Salmon, about ſixty Tun, belonging to the Lord <hi>Maſſereen,</hi> in a Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe
near the Town, made a ſhift to get it all, excepting forty
Barrels, which afterwards came to the hands of the Enemy, and a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99372:12"/>
great Stack of Hay, which ſtood within a quarter of a Mile of the
Town, which might eaſily have been brought in, but was not.</p>
            <p>The Enemy having now got the Fort of <hi>Kilmore</hi> by Surrender,
(which lies on the Mouth of the River) wherein was 300 Foot, belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnig
to the Town, and ſome Powder and Salmon, the Soldiers made
Conditions to carry out their Swords and Baggage, (leaving their
Fire-Arms behind;) but theſe Conditions were not performed, for moſt
of them had their Swords, Hats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> taken from them in the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of <hi>Colrain, Balymenagh</hi> and <hi>Antrim,</hi> for want of Guards to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
them from Garriſon to Garriſon, as agreed upon; upon which
Complaint being made to General <hi>Hamilton,</hi> all the Satisfaction he
gave, was, That if the Perſons wronged could diſcover who plunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them, they ſhould be puniſhed (if Soldiers,) but was not able
to prevent the Barbarous Actions of the Rabble. After the Fort of
<hi>Kilmore</hi> was ſurrendred, the Iriſh Army were Quartered from St. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtons</hi>
along the Country, about eight miles in length, and <hi>Brook-Hall</hi>
was ordered for the Duke of <hi>Berwick,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fitz-James,</hi> and General
<hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Quarters. They alſo placed about 100 men in the Fort
of <hi>Kilmore,</hi> and about two Batallions of Foot at <hi>Pennyburne-Mill,</hi> lying
a mile from the Tomn; ſo that moſt of their Foot were near that
Place, and the greateſt Body of their Horſe, conſiſting of two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments,
belonging to the Lord <hi>Gallmoy</hi> and Sir <hi>Maurice Euſtace</hi> of
<hi>Caſtlemartin,</hi> and a Regiment of Dragoons, belonging to the Lord
<hi>Duleeke,</hi> were quartered about St. <hi>Johnſtons</hi> and the <hi>Carrigans;</hi> all
which did not amount to more than 7000 on <hi>Derry</hi> ſide, and about
3000 attending a Battery raiſed near <hi>Strongs-Mill,</hi> in view of the
whole Town, on the other ſide of the Water; in which Battery
were ſeven Cannon, which play'd very warmly againſt the Town,
and eſpecially againſt the Walls, but did no great prejudice; the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
ordering Blinds to be built on the Walls, to prevent the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's
Shot againſt the Men who were poſted on the Works: The
Harm they did againſt the Town, was very ſmall, and only brake
ſome Slates and Tiles on the tops of Houſes. The Governors being
apprehenſive of ſome Bombs to be thrown into the Town, ordered a
great part of the Pavements to be pulled up, leſt the fall of a Bomb
might do ſome injury by breaking of the Streets, and caſting the
Stones about; and this was done by the Advice of an experienced
old Soldier, and all the Timber which was ſaved out of Houſes pull'd
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99372:13"/>
down without the Gates, laid round on the Walls to be flung over in
caſe of a Storm: Beſides this, there is a Wind-Mill within a ſmall ſpace
of that Garriſon, in which was poſted about 60 Fire-locks, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
kept the Enemy at ſome diſtance, and was of good uſe to the
Beſieged.</p>
            <p>The Enemy having thus encamped themſelves, (if I may call it ſo,)
the beſieged began to make ſome Sallies; but little Execution was
done, (for want of Horſe,) having turned their whole Body of Horſe,
ſave 100, out of the Gates, for want of Forage, until the 20th of <hi>April;</hi>
at which time our new General <hi>Murray,</hi> had a very great deſire to take
a Breathing to blood his Soldiers; the manner of it was pretty inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious,
(if ſo deſigned,) and therefore will ask leave to give ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of it, and of his Behaviour in the Enterprize.</p>
            <p>As I ſaid on the 20th of <hi>April</hi> he ordered 500 Fire-locks to march
out by ſmall Numbers, as ſecretly as they could, and lodge themſelves
in the Ditches between the Town and <hi>Pennyburn-Mill;</hi> this being
done with great Secrecy, he, and one Captain <hi>Nathaniel Bull,</hi> marched
out with two Troops, and moved towards this Mill, where two Batal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of the Enemies Foot lay, who immediately received the Allarm,
and ordered a Body of Horſe to advance and charge General <hi>Murray;</hi>
but he finding them too many for him, made a halt, and ordered 500
Fire-locks more to march out, who were drawn upon the top of the
Hill, in view of the Enemy; upon which the Foot at <hi>Pennyburn-Mill,</hi>
drew out in two Bodies, and the Beſiegers Horſe advanced on the
Strand to charge Colonel <hi>Murray,</hi> but received ſome prejudice by the
Men lodged in the Ditches, who flanked their Horſe; and altho' ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of them dropp'd, yet the reſt made good the charge againſt the
Townſ-men, who at the firſt Fire ran in the Rere, leaving the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
with Captain <hi>Bull,</hi> and ſome others, engaged; but whether Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
<hi>Murray,</hi> and theſe with him, knew that the Party retreated, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
juſtly ſay, however he charged through the Enemies Horſe, and
forced his way back, without receiving any prejudice, only his Horſe
ſhot in the Counter; and to give the Party who engaged them their
due, about 15 purſued, piſtolling and ſlaſhing the Proteſtant Horſe,
within Carbine-ſhot of the Gates; but ſome of them never returned
to brag of their Valour, being all ſlain but two by the Men who had
lined the Ditches near the Strand; in this Skirmiſh Monſieur <hi>Mamoe,</hi> the
<hi>French</hi> General of Horſe, was killed; Major <hi>Toafe,</hi> Brother to the Earl of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99372:13"/>
               <hi>Carlingford,</hi> Captain <hi>Fitzger<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

               </hi> Captain <hi>Bourke,</hi> and 9 Officers more,
with 60 private Men; and now the 500 Fire-locks, poſted on the top
of the Hill with the Foot which lined the Ditches, made their Retreat
towards the Town, (having an account of the Lord <hi>Gallmoy,</hi> and Sir
<hi>Maurice Euſtace</hi>'s 2 Regiments of Horſe, marching with all ſpeed to get
between them and home,) and narrowly eſcaped, with the loſs of 7
Men, and a Lieutenant; and then the Guns from the Town forced
the Enemies Horſe to retreat.</p>
            <p>Within three or four days after, there was another Sally, wherein
the Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> received a ſlight Wound on his Back, Monſieur
<hi>Puſcinian,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> General of Foot killed, and <hi>Monſieur Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee,</hi>
the chief Ingeneer, wounded in the Head, the Earl of <hi>Abbercorn</hi>'s
Horſe killed under him, and he very narrowly eſcaping, leaving his
Scarlet Cloak, Saddle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for a Prey to the beſieged; ſome others
were killed and wounded, but their Names I cannot particularly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but ſuch was the Execution done by the Proteſtants, that by
ſome few Sallies many of the Beſieged were richly clothed in the late
King <hi>Jame's</hi> Livery, which afforded great diverſion to the Governors
to ſee their Soldiers ſtrut in Scarlet laced with Silver and Gold, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in Buff, whoſe Fortune afforded them no better.</p>
            <p>Theſe Sallies proving ſo ſucceſsful, and the Men ſeeing ſome Action,
occaſioned the whole Town to be greatly ſatisfied with their new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors,
and General <hi>Murray;</hi> in ſo much that they often importuned
their Officers to go out; and the great freedom and familiarity of
the Governors and Officers, had ſo prevailing a Power over the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
that nothing was dearer than their Commanders, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Town; whereupon a firm Reſolution was ſet up to defend
the Place to the utmoſt extremity; and therefore certain Rules were
agreed upon, (by a general Council of War,) to be obſerved in the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,
of which I muſt beg leave to give the Reader ſome ſhort
Account.</p>
            <p>There being 12000 Men in Arms in the Town, it was ordered, that
two entire Regiments ſhould be on the Guard each Night.</p>
            <p>That each Regiment had a Poſt aſſigned on the Walls, where they
were to repair on all Allarms without farther Order, and there remain
till drawn off.</p>
            <p>That every Regiment ſhould have their Quarters aſſigned them to
be together; and all the Drums of that Regiment to be quartered in
one houſe in caſe of Allarms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:99372:14"/>
That the Adjutants of the whole G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rriſon ſhould be quartered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
that they may be found on all occaſions; and that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutant
of each Regiment ſhould remain on the Main Guard till the
Regiment would be relieved from Duty to which he belonged.</p>
            <p>That no Tipling or Drinking ſhould be after Eight of the Clock at
night, or Candles lighted, which might direct the Enemy to fire
their Cannon againſt the Town in the night-time.</p>
            <p>That each private Soldier ſhould have a Salmon and a half, two
pounds of Salt Beef, and four Quarts of Oatmeal in the Week, and
the Inn-keepers not to take more than a Peny a Quart for Beer, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the Soldiers receiv'd no Pay.</p>
            <p>That the Ammunition ſhould be removed out of the grand Store,
and lodged in four ſeveral Places, in caſe of accidental Fire, or Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery;
ſo that all might not be loſt at one time.</p>
            <p>That the Keys of the Gates ſhould be lodged on the Main-Guard,
and the ſame to be delivered to no Perſon under the degree of a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
there being two to attend at each Gate every night.</p>
            <p>That all Merchants Goods belonging to the Merchants who went
away, ſhould be brought into common Stores, and Inventories ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of them, to prevent Soldiers from breaking Shops and Cellars.</p>
            <p>That no Soldier ſhould fire a Shot in the Garriſon needleſly, to
waſte Powder and Ball, until there ſhould be occaſion.</p>
            <p>All which Orders and Rules were duly obſerved by the Soldiers,
as well for their own Safety, as by the Command of the Governors.</p>
            <p>After the Garriſon was brought to this good Order, and the Hearts
of the People a little at reſt, (after ſome ſuſpected had left the Town,)
they now unanimouſly reſolve to ſtand to their Work, and conſider,
That if they had ſurrendred, and taken Protections to go to their
own Dwellings, all was gone from thence before they came, and
then they would be expoſed to the Mercy of the Rabble, who would
not only plunder them of what they had, but might barbarouſly
murther them; and if they eſcaped murthering, muſt of neceſſity pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
for Want; and therefore of the two choſe rather to die on the
Walls, than run thoſe Hazards; ſo that now all thoughts of ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
was quite removed from them, and a Siege began to grow
ſomething familiar.</p>
            <p>The Governors finding the humor of the People, and that <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don-Derry</hi>
was likely to be ſome time beſieged before Relief was ſent
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99372:14"/>
from <hi>England,</hi> conſidered what Places about the Town could annoy
them moſt, and from what part of the Town the Guns could moſt
conveniently prejudice the Beſiegers. The firſt thing they went up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
was the burning of all the Houſes clear round the Town with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Walls, and levelling their Rubbiſh and Ditches, ſo that the
Enemy might not ſculk in them, and gall the men on the Walls; and
alſo conſidering that the great Quick-ſet Hedge round Alderman
<hi>Tompkins</hi>'s Orchard, and the Orchard it ſelf, might be prejudicial
likewiſe to the Walls, ordered the ſame to be razed.</p>
            <p>Theſe things were no ſooner thought of, and Orders given, but
the Soldiers as readily and chearfully put them in execution, and in a
very ſmall time perfected this Work to admiration.</p>
            <p>And as the wiſe Governors and Officers conſidered what might be
diſadvantageous to themſelves, reſolve upon ſomething to be equally
prejudicial to the Enemy, and knowing there were ſome Guns to
ſpare, which were brought up from the Fort of <hi>Kilmore,</hi> ordered two
of them to be mounted on the top of the Steeple of the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a great heighth, commanding all Places about the Town within
Cannon-ſhot: This Work was no ſooner ordered, but in a manner
finiſhed, and indeed to the ſatisfaction of the whole Garriſon; for
thoſe Guns exceedingly gall'd the Enemy in the Battery on the other
ſide of the Water, inſomuch that their Battery was ſeveral times
broken, and at length, when they diſcovered a Gun to be fired from
the Steeple, the Soldiers would either run out of the Works in great
diſorder, or fall flat on their Bellies to avoid the Shot.</p>
            <p>Now the Town being a very ſtrong Place by its natural Situation,
built on the extream North-point of a long Tract of Ground envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned
on the Eaſt-ſide with the River about 300 yards broad, on the
Weſt with a Bogg or Marſh Ground, and on the South is the Way
leading to it, which is but very narrow, and a ſort of a Fort caſt up
at the Wind-mill, to ſecure that entrance: Beſides this, the Town is
oval in its Form, and a regular Fortification being built by the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners</hi>
in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> or the beginning of the
Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, the outward Wall being about 21 or
22 Foot high, and of a great thickneſs, and the inward Wall riſing
as high or near the heighth of a Man of the outward Wall, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
theſe two, Earth filled up in the middle, whereon eight or ten
men may walk in Breaſt, ſo that no Gun can batter it to make a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99372:15"/>
Breach to ſtorm: There are four Gates belonging to this Town, <hi>viz.
Biſhopſgate, Ferry-Key-Gate, Ship-Key-Gate,</hi> and <hi>Butchers-Gate;</hi> they
ſtand directly oppoſite to each other, there being a Square in the
Centre of the Town, in which Square the Market-Houſe ſtands, and
a large Street anſwering every Gate from this Square; at every Gate
there is a Gun planted within twenty yards of the Gate, and four
Guns planted at the Market-Houſe, one directly againſt each Gate,
to clear the Streets: There are nine Baſtions about the Town, and
about three or four Guns on each Baſtion; beſides this, there is a
dry Ditch round the Town, over which there are two Draw-bridges,
one at <hi>Biſhopſgate,</hi> and the other at <hi>Ferry-Key-Gate;</hi> but in ſome
places this Ditch is filled up, not being kept clean for a long time:
But to ſatisfie the Reader's Curioſity of the Place, I have here given
a Draught or Map of the Town.</p>
            <p>But to return to my former Diſcourſe, I muſt again proceed to
give ſome Account of the Trouble the Governors and the Officers
were under, fearing His preſent Majeſty would not ſend Relief to
them in the time they were really able to maintain that Garriſon;
for it was but reaſonable to think His Majeſty would imagine the
Place was either loſt, or not able to hold out long, in regard Col.
<hi>Cunningham</hi> and <hi>Richards</hi> had returned with the Relief they brought
thither: And now the Fort of <hi>Kilmore</hi> being ſurrendred, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the River, and the Iriſh Army lying round the Town on
both ſides of the River, a Council of War was called, and a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
made by the Governors, That it was abſolutely neceſſary to give
the King an Account of the State and Condition of that Garriſon;
but there being no manner of way to effect this, but by ſending ſome
perſon who durſt adventure to make his Way through the Iriſh Camp,
and take ſhipping at the next Port he could compaſs; which Service
was undertaken by one then preſent, and by a contrivance in making
ſome of the Townſmen, poſted at the Windmill, fire ſome looſe Shot
after him in view of the Enemies Scouts, was received by them as a
Deſerter, who afterwards, (as I have been informed,) made his way
into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſo to <hi>England,</hi> eſcaping ſeveral imminent Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
and after his departure from <hi>London-Derry,</hi> the enſuing Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
happened in the County of <hi>Downe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Iriſh Army having run through all the North, and many of
the Proteſtants having taken Protections from Lieut. Gen. <hi>Hamilton,</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:99372:15"/>
all the <hi>Ards-Iſle</hi> of <hi>Kele,</hi> and the lower part of the County of <hi>Downe</hi>
were forced to give a certain quantity of Oatmeal, and other Grain
out of every Pariſh, to be delivered at the Garriſons of <hi>Charlimont,</hi> or
<hi>Carrickfergus,</hi> before they could get Protections, and upon delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ſuch Meal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they were not to be diſturbed in their Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
and that thoſe who did moleſt them, ſhould be deem'd as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Robbers.</p>
            <p>The poor Proteſtants being filled with great hopes of Peace, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
ſent in their Compoſition-Meal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and indeed before
the time limited, (although ſome of them wanted to ſupport their
Families,) thinking to get the greater favour: But this Agreement
was not unlike the Articles with the Proteſtants at <hi>Kilmore,</hi> (which
were broke as ſoon as the Caſtle was ſurrendred;) for the Lord <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagh</hi>'s
Regiment of Mountaniers, newly rais'd in the upper Part of
the County of <hi>Downe,</hi> (of meer wild Iriſh,) came down and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
all the <hi>Ards</hi> and <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Kele,</hi> notwithſtanding the Conditions
which were exactly performed by the Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>At this time one <hi>Hen. Hunter,</hi> one of the ſeven Captains diſarm'd
near <hi>Antrim,</hi> (as I mention'd before,) being in the County of <hi>Downe,</hi>
when thoſe Outrages were committed by the Lord <hi>Evagh</hi>'s ragged
Regiment, informed the People, That it was lawful to kill any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
who ſhould rob or plunder them after their Conditions were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled;
and having ſome acquaintance in that Country, and troubled
for being diſarmed, prevailed upon the people to ſtand on their own
Defence againſt theſe common Plunderers: This Advice ſoon faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
upon the poor oppreſſed Proteſtants, inſomuch that in ſome few
days Capt. <hi>Hunter</hi> got near 3000 Horſe and Foot in a Body, with
what Arms they had, and were fully reſolved to defend that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
until an Army landed out of <hi>England;</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Maxwel</hi>'s
Houſe at <hi>Killeleagh,</hi> was the chief Garriſon, where Capt. <hi>Hunter</hi>
brought an old Iron Gun which lay ſome years at <hi>Downe-patrick,</hi> and
mounted it there.</p>
            <p>The News of this ſoon was with the late King <hi>James</hi> at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and
and thereupon the whole Royal Regiment, then before <hi>London-Derry,</hi>
part of the Lord <hi>Gallmoy</hi>'s Regiment of Horſe, Sir <hi>Maurice Euſtace</hi>'s
Regiment of Horſe, and the Lord <hi>Duleeke</hi>'s Regiment of Dragoons,
were ordered to march immediately from the Camp againſt this
<hi>Hunter,</hi> and to joyn ſome Foot quartered at <hi>Antrim, Carikfergus,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99372:16"/>
Belfaſt</hi> and <hi>Liſlegarvey,</hi> under the Command of Major General <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char,</hi>
and Lieut. Col. <hi>Mark Talbot;</hi> this was ſo ſuddenly done, and
all correſpondence being ſtopt with Col. <hi>Hunter,</hi> about the 28th of
<hi>April,</hi> the Enemy ſurprized Capt. <hi>Hunter,</hi> falling in between his
Horſe and Foot, near <hi>Comlir,</hi> putting them to the Rout, killing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
300, beſides ſeveral wounded, and taken Priſoners; Captain
<hi>Hunter</hi> himſelf making his eſcape in a ſmall Boat into the Iſle of <hi>Man.</hi>
In this Buſineſs ſome of the Enemy were ſlain, and eſpecially Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
<hi>Lock,</hi> who it's thought was killed by ſome of his own Party,
who had a Deſign on his Place, he being a Proteſtant; for he was
ſhot in the Back with a brace of Bullets, which could not be done by
the Proteſtant Party, in regard the Cornet was in the Centre, and
the Ranks never broke; which fully demonſtrates the good Will of
Papiſts to Proteſtants, although they fight under the ſame General,
and the ſame Cauſe.</p>
            <p>This Rebellion of the Proteſtants in the <hi>Ards,</hi> (as it was called)
gave a fair opportunity for the Lord <hi>Evagh</hi>'s Regiment, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
did not let it paſs them; for in a very ſhort time moſt of the
Proteſtants thereabouts were plundered, and turned out of their own
Houſes, and afterwards chaſed by the Lord <hi>Duleeke</hi>'s Dragoons to
<hi>Donaghadee,</hi> driving them into the Sea; but one <hi>Agnew</hi> riding at
Anchor, and having four ſmall Guns on Board, and obſerving how
barbarouſly the Iriſh were forcing the poor Wretches into the Sea,
fired two Guns at the Enemy; upon which they halted; ſo that
Capt. <hi>Agnew</hi> brought 68 on Board, and Landed them in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
without taking one penny Fraight.</p>
            <p>The Enemy having met with theſe Repulſes againſt the Town and
finding the Place impregnable by Storm, and believing the Garriſon
wanted both Commanders, Proviſions, and were ſcarce of freſh Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
now reſolved to block it up, and ſtop all manner of Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
between the Beſiegers and <hi>England,</hi> by which means they
hoped they would ſurrender, and the rather that they were diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
by Col. <hi>Cunningham</hi> and <hi>Richards</hi> going away, and afterwards
by the Loſs of <hi>Kilmore;</hi> and therefore from the 25th of <hi>April,</hi> till
the 11th or 12th of <hi>May,</hi> there was little or no Action, except the
Townſmen now and then killing ſome of the Enemy, who too ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
came into Alderman <hi>Tompkins</hi>'s Orchard, and the Meadows
and Parks about the Town, to take away the Horſes before they had
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99372:16"/>
eaten the Graſs thereabouts: About this time the Beſieged made a Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and defeated a ſmall Party of Foot, and then forced into the Town,
and upon their Retreat, they were protected by the Guns of the
Town-Walls; in this Sally ſome ſmall Booty was had, but not ſo
much as generally reported.</p>
            <p>Some few days before this, the Enemy had a warm Salute by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached
Party out of the Garriſon, who beat off Col. <hi>Ramſey</hi> and his
Party, coming to ſecure the ſmall Rivulet near the Town, thinking
the Beſieged had their freſh Water there; in which Sally ſome Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and Soldiers fell of the Enemies Party. This, with the ſeveral
other Defeats, diſheartned the Iriſh Army very much, who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
weary of that long Fatigue of a Siege, generally drinking Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and but very indifferent Meat: Whereupon it was reſolved,
That they ſhould draw off ſome ſmall diſtance from the Town, (and
level all the Ditches wherein the Beſiegers frequently gall'd them,)
until a Supply of Proviſions came from <hi>Dublin</hi> to the Camp.</p>
            <p>About this time the Men of <hi>Iniskilling,</hi> having Advice of ſome
Proviſions going towards <hi>London-Derry</hi> with a Convoy, under the
Command of Col. <hi>Sarsfield,</hi> intercepted them, took all the Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and kill'd ſome of the Convoy, the reſt eſcaping narrowly.</p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>London-Derry</hi> being thus ſucceſsful in all their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes,
now daily expect Relief from <hi>England,</hi> and at length
Major General <hi>Kirk,</hi> with about three Regiments, appeared in <hi>Logh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foile,</hi>
with three and twenty Sail, and three Frigats; ſome few days
after Capt. <hi>Richards</hi> the Engineer, had got off with his Veſſel, which
ran on the Sands for want of a skilful Pilot; he loſt ſome Men, and
came for <hi>England,</hi> but Major General <hi>Kirk</hi> ſtill remains in the <hi>Logh,</hi>
about a Mile from <hi>Kilmore,</hi> and four Miles off the Town, in view of
the Beſiegers, to their great Satisfaction, although he cannot get
into the Town, the River being Boomb'd between the Caſtle of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi>
and the Garriſon, and durſt not Land his Men, they not being
able to fight their way through the Enemies Camp, and therefore
expect farther Relief to be able to take the Field.</p>
