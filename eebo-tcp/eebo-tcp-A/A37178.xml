            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

are chiefly usefull to Coasters, and

            <p>Some there are, that object that
even in the likelyhoods of Story (and
Story, where ever it seems most like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
growes most pleasant) he doth too
frequently intermixe such Fables, as
are objects lifted above the Eyes of
Nature; and as he often interrogates
his Muse, not as his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ationall Spirit
but as a <hi>Familiar,</hi> separated from his
body, so her replyes bring him where
he spends time in immortall conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation;
whilst supernaturally he doth
often advance his men to the quality
of Gods, and depose his Gods to the
condition of men.</p>
            <p>His Successour to fame, (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
to censure) is <hi>Virgil;</hi> whose
Toyles nor Virtue canno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from the Pievishnesse (or rather
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97590:6"/>
curiosity) of divers Readers. He is
upbraided by some (who perhaps
are affected Antiquaries, and make
prioritie of time the measure of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence)
for gaining his renown by
imitation of <hi>Homer:</hi> Whilst others
(no lesse bold with that antient Guide)
say, he hath so often led him into
Heaven, and Hell, till by conversation
with Gods and Ghosts, he sometimes
deprives us of those naturall proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities
in Story, which are instructive
to humane life: And others a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>firm
(if it be not irreverence to record their
opinion) that even in wit, he seems
deficient by many omissions; as if he
had design'd a penance of gravity to
himself and to posterity: And by
their observing that continued gravity,
me thinks they look upon him, as on a
Musician composing of Anthemes;
whose excellence consists more in the
solemnesse, then in the fancy; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the body of his Work as on the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of a Giant, whose force hath more
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97590:6"/>
of strength, then quicknesse; and of
patience, then activity.</p>
            <p>But these bold Censurers are in
danger of so many Enemies, as I shall
wisely shrink from them; and onely
observe, that if any Disciples of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable
<hi>Virgil</hi> can prove so formall,
as to esteem wit (as if it were levity)
an imputation to the Heroick Muse
(by which malevolent word, Wit,
they would disgrace her extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
heighths) yet if those grave Judges
will be held wise, they must endure
the sate of Wise-men; who alwayes
have but few of their Society; for
many more then consist of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
(perhaps not having the sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennesse
to be of it) are taken with
those bold flights, and think 'tis with
the Muse (whose noble Quarry is
men) as with the Eagle, who when
he soars high stoopes more prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously,
and is most certain of his
prey. And surely Poets (whose busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
should represent the Worlds
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97590:7"/>
true image often to our view) are not
lesse prudent then Painters, who when
they draw Landschaps, entertein not
the Eye wholly with even Prospect,
and a continued Flat; but (for varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
terminate the sight with lofty Hils,
whose obscure heads are sometimes in
the Clouds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucan</hi> who chose to write the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
actions that ever were allowed to
be true (which, for fear of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
witnesses, obliged him to a
very close attendance upon Fame)
did not observe that such an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
rather beseemed an Historian
then a Poet: for wise Poets think it
more worthy to seek out truth in
the passions, then to record the truth
of actions; and practise to describe
Mankind just as we are perswaded
or guided by instinct, not particular
persons, as they are lifted, or levell'd
by the force of Fate, it being nobler to
contemplate the generall History of
Nature, then a selected Diary of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97590:7"/>
And Painters are no more then
Historians, when they draw eminent
persons (though they term that draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the life) but when, by assembling
divers figures in a larger volume, they
draw passions (though they term it but
Story) then they increase in dignity and
become Poets.</p>
            <p>I have been thus hardy to call him
to account for the choyce of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
not meerly as it was Story,
but because the actions he recorded
were so eminent, and so near his time,
that he could not assist Truth, with such
ornaments as Poets, for usefull plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
have allow'd her; lest the feign'd
complexion might render the true, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected.
And now I will leave to others
the presumption of measuring his Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perboles,
by whose space and heighth
they maliciously take the dimension of
wit; and so mistake him in his boyling
Youth (which had mervellous forces)
as we disrellish excellent Wine when

if the People (whom they make ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill

               <hi>Tasso</hi> (who reviv'd the Heroick
flame after it was many ages quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
is held both in time and merit,
the first of the Moderns; an honour
by which he gains not much; because
the number he excells must needs be
few, which affords but one fit to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
him; for I will yield to their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
who permit not <hi>Ariosto,</hi> no

of the Heroicks; rather then to make
way by their admission for <hi>Dante,

too is chiefly allow'd him, where he
most endeavours to make <hi>Virgil</hi> his
Pattern: And again, when we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from whom <hi>Virgil</hi>'s spirit is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd,
we may observe how rarely hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
excellence is found; for Heroick
Poesie (which, if exact in it self, yields
not to any other Humane Work)
flow'd but in few, and even those
Streams descended but from one Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian

Poems as with the Originall
Pieces of Painters, whose Coppies
abate the excessive price of the first
Hand.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Tasso</hi> though he came late into
the world must have his share in that
Criticall Warre which never ceases
amongst the Learned; and he seems
most unfortunate, because his errours
which are deriv'd from the Antients,
when examin'd, grow in a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
excusable in them, and by being
his, admit no pardon. Such as are his
Councell assembled in Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his
Witches Expeditions through the
Air, and enchanted Woods inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
with Ghosts. For though the
elder Poets (which were then the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Priests) fed the World with super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
Tales, and so compounded
the Religion, of Pleasure and Mystery
(two Ingredients which never fail'd
to wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k upon the People) whilst for
the eternity of their Chiefs (more
refin'd by education) they surely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97590:9"/>
no such vain provision) Yet
a Christian Poet (whose Religion lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
needs the aids of invention) hath
lesse occasion to imitate such Fables, as
meanly illustrate a probable Heaven,
by the fashion, and dignity of Courts;
and make a resemblance of Hell, out
of the Dreams of frighted Women;
by which they continue and increase
the Melancholy mistakes of the
People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spencer</hi> may stand here as the last
of this short File of Heroick Poets;
Men, whose intellectuals were of so
great a making, (though some have
thought them lyable to those few
censures we have mention'd) as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they will in worthy memory
out-last even Makers of Laws, and
Founders of Empire, and all but
such as must therefore live equally
with them, because they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
their Names; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
with their own hands led
them to the Temple of Fame. And
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97590:10"/>
since we have dar'd to remember
those exceptions which the Curious
have against them; it will not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
I should forget what is obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
against <hi>Spencer;</hi> whose obsolete
language we are constrain'd to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
though it be grown the most
vulgar accusation that is lay'd to his
charge.</p>
            <p>Language (which is the onely
Creature of Man's Creation) hath,
like a Plant, seasons of flourishing, and
decay; like Plants, is remov'd from
one Soil to another, and by being
so transplanted, doth often gather vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
and increase. But as it is false
Husbandry to graft old Branch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
young Stocks: so we may won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that our Language (not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his time created out of a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of others, and then beginning to
flourish like a new Plant) should (as
helps to its increase) receive from his
hand new Grafts of old wither'd
Words. But this vulgar exception
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97590:10"/>
shall onely have the vulgar excuse;
which is, that the unlucky choise of
his <hi>Stanza</hi> hath by repetition of Rime
brought him to the necessity of many
exploded words.</p>
            <p>If we proceed from his Language
to his Argument, we must observe
with others, that his noble and most
artfull hands deserv'd to be employ'd
upon matter of a more naturall, and
therefore of a more usefull kind. His
Allegoricall Story (by many held de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
in the Connexion) resembling
(me thinks) a continuance of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Dreams; such as excellent
Poets, and Painters, by being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>studious,
may have in the beginning
of Feavers: And those morall visions
are just of so much use to Humane
application, as painted History, when
with the cousenage of lights it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
in Scenes, by which we are
much lesse inform'd then by actions on
the Stage.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, I have (perhaps) taken
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97590:11"/>
pains to make you think me mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
in observing how farre the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
have look'd into the Errours of
others: Errours, which the naturall
humour of imitation hath made so like
in all (even from <hi>Homer</hi> to <hi>Spencer</hi>) as
the accusations against the first, appear
but little more then repetition in every
processe against the rest: and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the resemblance of errour in
persons of one generation to that
which is in those of another age, we
may find it exceeds not any where,
notoriously, the ordinary proportion.
Such limits to the progresse of every
thing (even of worthinesse as well as
defect) doth Imitation give: for whilst
we imitate others, we can no more
excell them, then he that sails by
others Maps can make a new disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very:
and to Imitation, Nature (which
is the onely visible power and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God) perhaps doth needfully
encline us to keep us from excesses.
For, though every man be capable of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97590:11"/>
worthinesse and unworthinesse (as
they are defined by Opinion) yet no
man is built strong enough to bear
the extremities of either, without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loading
himself upon others shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
even to the wearinesse of many.
If courage be worthinesse, yet where
it is overgrown into extremes, it
becomes as wild and hurtfull as Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition;
and so what was reverenc'd
for Protection grows to be abhorred
for Oppression. If <hi>Learning</hi> (which
is not Knowledge, but a continued
Sailing by fantastick and uncertain
winds towards it) be Worthinesse,
yet it hath bounds in all Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers;
and Nature that measured those
bounds, seems not so partiall, as to
allow it in any one a much larger
extent then in another; as if in our
fleshy building, she considered the
furniture and the room, alike, and
together: for as the compasse of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dems
commonly fits the whole suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of those Kings that wear
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97590:12"/>
them; so throughout the whole
World, a very few inches may distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
the circumference of the head<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of their Subjects: Nor need we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
that Nature hath not some Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites,
to whom she doth dispense
this Treasure, <hi>Knowledge,</hi> with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
Liberality. For as there is n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

that great quantity of false gold; and

their weaker disciples.</p>
            <p>And as the qualities which are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
good, are bounded, so are the
bad; and likewise limited, as well as
gotten by imitation; for amongst
those that are extraordinary, eithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

own Subjects) we cannot find any one
so egregious (admitting cruelty and
avarice for the chiefest evils; and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
in government or doctrine, to be
the greatest errours) but that divers of
former or succeeding times may enter
the scales with them, and make the
balance even; though the passion of
Historians would impose the contrary
on our belief; who in dispraise of evil
Princes are often as unjust and exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
as the common People: for there
was never any Monarch so cruel, but
he had living subjects; nor so avarici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
but that his subjects were richer
then himself; nor ever any disease in
government so extremely infectious, as
to make an universall Anarchy; or
any errour in Doctrine so strong by the
maintainer, but that Truth (though
it wrestled with her often and in
many places) hath at some season, and
on some ground, made her advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and successe apparent: Therefore
we may conclude, that Nature, for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97590:13"/>
the safety of mankind, hath as well
(by dulling and stopping our progresse
with the constant humour of imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
given limits to courage and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to wickednesse and to errour, as it
hath ordained the shelves before the
shore, to restrain the rage and excesses
of the Sea.</p>
            <p>But I feel (Sir) that I am falling
into the dangerous Fit of a hot Writer;
for, instead of performing the promise
which begins this Preface, and doth
oblige me (after I had given you the
judgement of some upon others) to
present my self to your censure; I am
wandring after new thoughts: but I
shall ask your pardon, and return to
my undertaking.</p>
            <p>My Argument I resolved should
consist of Christian persons; for since
Religion doth generally beget and
govern manners, I thought the
example of their actions would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
most upon our own, by being
derived from the same Doctrine and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97590:13"/>
Authority; as the particular Sects edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
by Philosophers were diligent
and pliant to the dictates and fashions
of such as deriv'd themselves from
the same Master; but lazy and froward
to those who conversed in other
Schools. Yet all these Sects pretended
to the same beauty, <hi>Virtue;</hi> though
each did court her more fondly, when
she was dressed at their own homes
by the hands of their acquaintance:
And so Subjects bred under the laws
of a Prince (though Laws differ
not much in Morality or Priviledge
throughout the civil World, being
every where made for direction of
Life, more then for sentences of
Death) will rather die near that
Prince, defending those they have been
taught, then live by taking new from
another.</p>
            <p>These were partly the reasons why
I chose a Story of such Persons as
professed Christian Religion; but I
ought to have been most enclined to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97590:14"/>
it, because the Principles of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
conduce more to explicable Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
to plain demonstrative Justice, and
even to Honour (if Virtue the Mother
of Honour be voluntary and active in
the dark, so as she need not laws to
compell her, nor look for witnesses
to proclaim her) then any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
that ever assembled men to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worship. For that of the <hi>Iews</hi>
doth still consist in a sullen separation
of themselves from the rest of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
flesh, which is a fantasticall
pride of their own cleannesse, and an
uncivil disdain of the imagined con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagiousnesse
of others; and at this
day, their cantonizing in Tribes, and
shynesse of alliance with neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
deserve not the terme of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
love, but rather seems a bestiall
melancholy of hearding into their
own Walks. That of the Ethnicks,
like this of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> consisted in
the vain pride of Empire, and never
enjoyned a Jewish separation, but
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97590:14"/>
drew all Nations together; yet not as
their companions of the same spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
but as slaves to a yoke: Their
sanctity was Honour, and their Honour
onely an impudent courage, or dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
in destroying. But Christian
Religion hath the innocence of Village
neighbourhood, and did antiently
in its politicks rather promote the
interest of Mankind then of States;
and rather of all States then of One;
for particular endeavours, onely in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of our own homes, are signs
of a narrow morall education, not of
the vast kindnesse of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which likewise ordained as well
an universall communion of bosomes,
as a community of wealth. Such is
Christian Religion in the precepts,
and was once so in the practise. But I
resolved my Poem should represent
those of a former age, perceiving 'tis
with the servants of Christ, as with
other servants under temporall power,
who with all cleannesse, and even
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97590:15"/>
with officious diligence perform their
duty in their Masters sight; but still as
he grows longer absent, become more
slothfull, unclean, and false. And this,
who ever compares the present with
the Primitive times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may too palpably
and with horrour discern.</p>
            <p>When I considered the actions
which I meant to describe, (those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
the persons) I was again per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
rather to chuse those of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
age then the present: and in a
Century so farre removed, as might
preserve me from their improper
examinations who know not the
requisites of a Poem, nor how much
pleasure they lose (and even the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of Heroick Poesie are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable)
who take away the liberty
of a Poet, and fetter his feet in the
shackles of an Historian: For why
should a Poet doubt in Story to
mend the intrigues of Fortune by
more delightfull conveyences of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
Fiction, because austere Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97590:15"/>
have enter'd into bond to truth?
an obligation which were in Poets, as
foolish and unnecessary as is the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
of false Martyrs, who lie in chains
for a mistaken opinion: But by this I
would imply, that Truth narrative, and
past, is the Idol of Historians, (who
worship a dead thing) and truth ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,
and by e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fects continually
alive, is the Mistresse of Poets, who
hath not her existence in matter but in
reason.</p>
            <p>I was likewise more willing to derive
my theme from elder times, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it no little mark of skilfulnesse to
comply with the common Infirmity;
for men (even of the best education)
discover their eyes to be weak, when
they look upon the glory of Virtue
(which is great actions) and rather
endure it at distance then near; being
more apt to believe, and love the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown
of Predecessours, then of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries,
whose deeds excelling
theirs in their own sight, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97590:16"/>
upbraid them, and are not reverenced
as examples of Virtue, but envyed as
the favours of Fortune: But to make
great actions credible is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
Art of Poets; who, though they
avouch the utility of Fictions, should
not (by altering and subliming Story)
make use of their Priviledge to the
detriment of the Reader: whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity
(when things are not repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
in proportion) doth much
allay the relish of his pity, hope,
joy, and other Passions: For we may
descend to compare the deceptions in
Poesie to those of them that professe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
dextery of Hand, which resembles
Conjuring, and to such we come not
with the intention of <hi>Lawyers</hi> to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the evidence of facts, but are
content (if we like the carriage of their
feigned motion) to pay for being well
deceived.</p>
            <p>As in the choise of time, so of place,
I have complied with the weaknesse of
the generality of men; who think the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97590:16"/>
best objects of their own countrey so
little to the size of those abroad, as if
they were shew'd them by the wrong
end of a Prospective: for Man (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
the appetites of his first Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
till he arrive at his second which
is more froward) must be quieted
with something that he thinks excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
which he may call his own; but
when he sees the like in other places
(not staying to compare them)
wrangles at all he hath. This leads
us to observe the craftinesse of the
<hi>Comicks,</hi> who are onely willing when
they describe humour (and humour is
the Drunkennesse of a Nation which
no sleep can cure) to lay the Scene in
their own countrey; as knowing we
are (like the Sonne of <hi>Noah</hi>) so little
distasted to behold each others shame,
that we delight to see even that of a
Father: yet when they would set
forth greatnesse and excellent virtue
(which is the Theam of <hi>Tragedy</hi>)
publickly to the people; they wisely
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97590:17"/>
(to avoid the quarrels of neighbourly
envie) remove the Scene from home.
And by their example I travaild too;
and <hi>Italie</hi> (which was once the Stage
of the World) I have made the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
where I shew in either Sex, some
patterns of humane life, that are (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps)
fit to be follow'd.</p>
            <p>Having told you why I took the
actions that should be my Argument,
from men of our own Religion, and
given you reasons for the choice of
the time and place design'd for those
actions; I must next acquaint you
with the Schools where they were
bred; not meaning the Schools where
they took their Religion, but Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality;
for I know Religion is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
rather inherited then taught: and
the most effectuall Schools of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
are Courts and Camps: Yet
towards the first, the people are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
through envie; and towards the
other, through fear; and alwayes jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of both for Injustice, which is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97590:17"/>
the naturall Scandall cast upon Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and great force. They look
upon the outward Glory or Blaze
of Courts, as Wilde-beasts in dark
nights stare on their Hunters Torches;
but though the expences of Courts
(whereby they shine) is that consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
glory in which the people think
their liberty is wasted (for wealth is
their Liberty and lov'd by them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to jealousie (being themselves a
courser sort of Princes, apter to take
then to pay) yet Courts (I mean all
abstracts of the Multitude; either by
King, or Assemblies) are not the
Schools where men are bred to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
but the Temples where some
times Oppressours take Sanctuary;
a safety which our reason must allow
them. For the ancient laws of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
(deriv'd from God) provid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

chiefly for Actions that proceed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d
from necessity; and who can imagine
lesse then a necessity of oppressing
the people, since they are never wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97590:18"/>
either to buy their Peace or to pay
for War?</p>
            <p>Nor are Camps the Schools of
wicked Destroyers, more then the
<hi>Inns of Court</hi> (being the Nursery of
Judges) are the Schools of Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
for as Judges are Avengers of
private men against private Robbers,
so are Armies the Avengers of the
Publick against Publick Invaders
(either Civill or Forreign) and
Invaders are Robbers, though more
in Countenance then those of the
High-way, because of their number.
Nor is there other difference between
Armies, when they move towards
Sieges, or Battell, and Judges moving
in their Circuit (during the danger of
extraordinary Malefactours) with the
Guards of the County; but that the
latter is a lesse Army, and of lesse di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline.
If any man can yet doubt of
the necessary use of Armies, let him
study that which was antiently call'd
a Monster, the Multitude (for Wolves
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97590:18"/>
are commonly harmelesse when they
are met alone, but very uncivill in
Heards) and he will not find that all
his kindred by <hi>Adam</hi> are so tame, and
gentle, as those Lovers that were bred
in <hi>Arcadia:</hi> or to reform his opinion,
let him ask why (during the utmost
age of History) Cities have been at
the charge of defensive Walls; and why
Fortification hath been practis'd so
long, till it is grown an Art?</p>
            <p>I may now believe I have usefully
taken from Courts and Camps the
patterns of such as will be fit to be
imitated by the most necessary Men;
and the most necessary m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n are those
who become principall by preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of blood (which is seldome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assisted
with education) or by great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of mind, which, in exact defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
is Virtue. The common Croud
(of whom we are hopelesse) we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert;
being rather to be corrected by
laws (where Precept is accompany'd
with Punishment) then to be taught
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97590:19"/>
by Poesie; for few have arriv'd at the
skill of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> or at his good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
whom we may suppose to have
met with extraordinary Grecian
beasts, when so successfully he reclaim'd
them with his Harp. Nor is it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
that Heroick Poesie should be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd
to the reach of Common men;
for if the examples it presents prevaile
upon their Chiefs, the delight of Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
(which we hope we have prov'd
to be as effectuall to good as to evil)
will rectifie by the rules, which those
Chiefs establish of their own lives, the
lives of all that behold them; for the
example of life, doth as much surpasse
the force of precept, as Life doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
Death.</p>
            <p>In the choice of these Objects
(which are as Sea-marks to direct
the dangerous Voyage of Life) I
thought fit to follow the Rule of
Coasting Mapps, where the Shelv's
and Rocks are describ'd as well the
safe Channell; the care being equall
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97590:19"/>
how to avoid, as to proceed: and the
Characters of men (whose passions
are to be eschu'd) I have deriv'd
from the Distempers of Love, or Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition:
for Love and Ambition are
too often the raging Feavers of great
minds. Yet Ambition (if the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
acception of the word were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected)
would signifie no more then an
extraordinary lifting of the feet in the
rough wayes of Honour, over the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments
of Fortune; and hath a
warmt'h (till it be chaf'd into a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver)
which is necessary for every virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
breast: for good men are guilty of
too little appetite to greatnesse, and it
either proceeds from that they call
contentednesse (but contentednesse
when examin'd doth mean some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Lazynesse as well as modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
or from some melancholy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
left of the Cloyster; where they
would make life (for which the world
was onely made) more unpleasant then
Death; as if Nature, the Vicegerent
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97590:20"/>
of God (who in providing delightfull
varieties which virtuous greatnesse
can best possesse, or assure peaceably
to others, implicitly commanded the
use of them) should in the necessaries
of life (life being her chief businesse)
though in her whole reign she never
committed one errour, need the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of Fryars; whose solitude makes
them no more fit for such direction,
then Prisoners long fette<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'d are for a
race.</p>
            <p>In saying this, I onely awaken such
retir'd men, as evaporate their
strength of mind by close and long
thinking; and would every where
separate the Soul from the Body,
ere we are Dead, by perswading us
(though they were both created and
have been long Companions toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
that the preferment of the one
must meerly consist in deserting the
other; teaching us to court the Grave,
as if during the whole lease of life we
were like Moles to live under ground;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97590:20"/>
or as if long and well Dying were
the certain means to Live in Heaven:
Yet Reason (which, though the most
profitable Talent God hath given us,
some Divines would have Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
to bury in the Napkin, and not
put it to use) perswades us, that the
painfull activenesse of Virtue (for
Faith on which some wholly depend
seems but a contemplative boast till
the effects of it grow exemplary by
action) will more probably acquire
everlasting dignities. And surely if
these severe Masters (who though
obscure in Cells, take it ill if their
very opinions rule not all, abroad) did
give good men leave to be industrious
in getting a Share of Governing the
World, the Multitudes (which are but
Tenants to a few Monarchs) would
endure that subjection which God
hath decreed them, with better order,
and more ease; for the world is onely
ill govern'd because the wicked take
more pains to get authority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97590:21"/>
virtuous; for the virtuous are often
preach'd into retirement; which is to
the publick as unprofitable as their
sleep; and the erroneousnesse of such
lazy rest let Philosophers judge; since
Nature (of whose body man thinks
himself the chiefest member) hath
not any where, at any time, been respit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from action (in her, call'd motion)
by which she universally preserves and
makes Life. Thus much of Ambition
which should have succeeded some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
I was saying of Love.</p>
            <p>Love in the Interpretation of the
Envious, is Softnesse; in the Wicked,
good men suspect it for Lust; and in
the Good, some Spirituall men have
given it the name of Charity: And
these are but terms to this which
seems a more consider'd Definition;
that indefinite Love is Lust; and Lust
when it is determin'd to one, is Love;
This Definition too but intrudes it
self on what I was about to say,
which is, (and spoken with sobernesse
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97590:21"/>
though like a <hi>Lay-man</hi>) that Love is
the most acceptable imposition of
Nature, the cause and preservation
of Life, and the very healthfulnesse,
of the mind, as well as of the body;
but Lust (our raging Feaver) is more
dangerous in Cities, then the Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in Ships.</p>
            <p>Now (Sir) I again ask you par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
for I have again digress'd; my
immediate businesse being to tell
you that the distempers of Love and
Ambition are the onely characters I
design'd to expose as objects of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour:
and my purpose was also to
assure you, that I never meant to
prostitute Wickednesse in the Images
of low and contemptible people, as
if I expected the meanest of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
for my Readers (since onely the
Rabble is seen at common executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
nor intended to raise iniquity to
that heighth of horrour, till it might
seem the fury of something worse
then a beast. In order to the first, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97590:22"/>
the <hi>Spartans</hi> (who to dete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>
their children from Drunkennesse ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custom'd
their Slaves to vomit before
them) did by such fulsome examples
rather teach them to disdain the
Slaves, then to loathe Wine; for men
seldome take notice of the Vice in
abject persons, especially where ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
constrains it. And in observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the second, I have thought,
that those horrid spectacles (when the
latter race of <hi>Gladiatours</hi> made up the
excesses of Roman feasts) did more
induce the Guests to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>est the cruelty
of mankind, then increase their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
by beholding such an impudent
scorn of Life.</p>
            <p>I have now given you the accomp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of such provisions as I made for this
new Building; and you may next
please (having examin'd the substance)
to take a view of the form; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
if I have methodically and with
discretion dispos'd of the materialls<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
which with some curiosity I had col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97590:22"/>
I cannot discern by any help
from reading, or learned men, (who
have been to me the best and briefest
Indexes of Books) that any Nation
hath in representment of great actions
(either by <hi>Heroicks</hi> or <hi>Dramaticks)</hi>
digested Story into so pleasant and
instructive a method as the English
by their <hi>Drama:</hi> and by that regular
species (though narratively and not in
Dialogue) I have drawn the body of
an Heroick Poem: In which I did not
onely observe the Symmetry (propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
five Books to five <hi>Acts,</hi>
and <hi>Canto</hi>'s to <hi>Scenes,</hi> (the <hi>Scenes</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their number ever governed by
occasion) but all the <hi>shadowings, happy
strokes, secret graces,</hi> and even the
<hi>drapery</hi> (which together make the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
beauty) I have (I hope) exactly
followed: and those compositions of
second beauty, I observe in the <hi>Drama</hi>
to be the under-walks, interwea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing,
or correspondence of lesser-design in
<hi>Scenes,</hi> not the great motion of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97590:23"/>
main plot, and coherence of the
<hi>Acts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first <hi>Act</hi> is the generall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative,
by rendring the chiefest cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of persons, and ending with
something that looks like an obscure
promise of design. The second be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
with an introducement of new
persons, so finishes all the characters,
and ends with some little performance
of that design which was promised
at the parting of the first <hi>Act.</hi> The
third makes a visible correspondence
in the Under-walks (or lesser intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
of persons; and ends with an
ample turn of the main design, and
expectation of a new. The fourth
(ever having occasion to be the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est)
gives a notorious turn to all the
Underwalks, and a countre-turn to
that main design which changed in
the Third. The fifth begins with an
intire diversion of the main, and
dependent Plots; then makes the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
correspondence of the persons
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97590:23"/>
more discernable, and ends with an
easie untying of those particular
knots, which made a contexture of
the whole; leaving such satisfaction
of probabilities with the Spectatour, as
may perswade him that neither For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
in the fate of the Persons, nor the
Writer in the Representment, have
been unnaturall or exorbitant. To
these <hi>Meander</hi>'s of the English Stage
I have cut out the walks of my
Poem; which in this description may
seem intricate and tedious; but will
I hope (when men take pains to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
what they have h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ard described)
appear to them as pleasant as a
summer passage on a crooked River,
where going about, and turning back,
is as delightfull as the delaies of part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Lovers.</p>
            <p>In placing the Argument (as a
<hi>Proem)</hi> before every <hi>Canto,</hi> I have
not wholly follow'd the example of
the Moderns; but averted it from that
purpose to which I found it frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97590:24"/>
used: for it hath been intended by
others, as the contents of the Chapter,
or as a Bill of Fare at a Venetian
Feast; which is not brought before
the meat to raise an expectation,
but to satisfie the longing curiosity of
the Guests. And that which I have
called my Argument, is onely meant as
an assistance to the Readers memory,
by containing brief hints, such, as
if all the Arguments were successively
read, would make him easily remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the mutuall dependencies of the
generall design; yet each rather men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
every person acting, then their
actions: But he is very unskilfull that
by Narratives before an Historicall
Poem prevents expectation; for so
he comes to have little successe over
the Reader (whom the Writer should
surprize, and as it were keep prisoner
for a time) as he hath on his Enemies,
who commanding a party out to take
them (and commonly Readers are
justly Enemies to Writers) imparts
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97590:24"/>
openly the design ere he begins the
action: Or he may be said to be as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily
officious, as he that leads a
wooing to a Mistresse, one that already
hath newly enjoyed her.</p>
            <p>I shall say a little, why I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
my interwoven <hi>Stanza</hi> of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>our,
though I am not obliged to excuse the
choice; for numbers in Verse must, like
distinct kinds of Musick, be exposed
to the uncertain and different taste of
severall Ears. Yet I may declare that
I beleev'd it would be more pleasant
to the Reader, in a Work of Length,
to give this respite or pause, between
every <hi>Stanza</hi> (having endeavoured that
each should contain a period) then
to run him out of breath with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<hi>Couplets.</hi> Nor do's alternate
Rime by any lowlinesse of cadence
make the sound lesse Heroick, but
rather adapt it to a plain and stately
composing of Musick; and the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of the <hi>Stanza</hi> renders it lesse
subtil to the Composer, and more easie
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:97590:25"/>
to the Singer; which in <hi>stylo recitativo,</hi>
when the Story is long, is chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite.
And this was indeed (if I shall
not betray vanity in my Confession)
the reason that prevailed most towards
my choice of this <hi>Stanza,</hi> and my
division of the main work into <hi>Canto's,</hi>
every <hi>Canto</hi> including a sufficient ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of some worthy design
or action; for I had so much heat
(which you, Sir, may call pride, since
pride may be allowed in <hi>Pegasus,</hi> if it
be a praise to other Horses) as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
they might (like the Works of
<hi>Homer</hi> ere they were joyned together
and made a Volume by the Athenian
King) be sung at Village-feasts;
though not to Monarchs after Victory,
nor to Armies before Battel. For so
(as an inspiration of glory into the one,
and of valour into the other) did <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>'s
spirit, long after his body's rest,
wander in Musick about <hi>Greece.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you have the Model of what
I have already built, or shall hereafter
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97590:25"/>
joyn to the same frame. If I be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
of Innovation, or to have trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed
against the method of the
Antients; I shall think my self secure
in believing, that a Poet who hath
wrought with his own Instruments
at a new design, is no more answerable
for disobedience to Predecessours, then
<hi>Law-makers</hi> are liable to those old
Laws which themselves have repealed.</p>
            <p>Having described the outward
frame, the large rooms within, the
lesser conveyances, and now the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture;
it were orderly to let you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the matter of which that furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

who hath the Vanity to shew his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments

curiosity, and censure of him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
them; yet I shall not give you
the trouble of inquiring what is, but
tell you of what I designed their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
which is <hi>Wit:</hi> And <hi>Wit</hi> is the

they are made wise by refining their
speech above the vulgar Dialect:
which is a mistake almost as great as
that of the people, who think Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
(which is a title that crowns at
riper years those that have practised
the dexterity of tongue) the ablest
men; who are indeed so much more
unapt for governing, as they are more
fit for Sedition: and it may be said of
them as of the Witches of <hi>Norway,</hi>
who can sell a Storm for a <hi>Doller,</hi>
which for ten thousand they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
allay. From the esteem of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they proceed to the admiration of
what are commonly called <hi>Conceits,</hi>
things that sound like the knacks or

from thence, after more conversation
and variety of objects, grow up to
some force of <hi>Fancy;</hi> Yet even then
like young Hawks they stray and fly

would ne're return to the Lure; and

often go at check ere they can make a

            <p>Old men, that have forgot their

their second, think it lies in <hi>Agnomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,</hi>
and in a kind of an alike tink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of words; or else in a grave telling
of wonderfull things, or in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

by favouring the past, that, as 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
if the bodies of men should
grow lesse, though but an unmeasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
proportion in seven years; Yet
reckoning from the <hi>Flood,</hi> they would
not remain in the stature of Frogs:
so if States and particular persons had

The last thing they suppose to be
<hi>Wit,</hi> is their bitter Morals, when they
almost declare themselves Enemies to
Youth and Beauty; by which Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
they seem cruel as <hi>Herod</hi> when
he surpris'd the sleeping Children of

wanting Enemies, that it is mortally
its own; so unpractis'd, that it is every

among <hi>Iews;</hi> and hath an infirmity
of sight more hurtfull then Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to Blind men; for though it
cannot chuse the way, it scorns to be
led. And Beauty, though many call
themselves her Friends, hath few but
such as are false to her: Though the
World sets her in a Throne, yet all
about her (even her gravest Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours)
are Traytours, though not in
conspiracy, yet in their distinct de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes;
and to make her certain not
onely of distresse but ruine, she is ever
pursu'd by her most cruel enemy, the
great Destroyer, <hi>Time.</hi> But I will

Nor will I presume to call the matter
of which the Ornaments or Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
parts of this Poem are compos'd,
<hi>Wit;</hi> but onely tell you my endeavour
was, in bringing Truth (too often
absent) home to mens bosomes, to
lead her through unfrequented and

Shades; by representing Nature though
not in an affected, yet in an unusuall
dresse.</p>
            <p>'Tis now fit, after I have given you
so long a survey of the Building, to
render you some accompt of the
Builder; that you may know by what
time, pains, and assistance I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
proceeded, or may hereafter
finish my work: and in this I shall
take occasion to accuse, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97590:29"/>
as Papers unworthy of light,
all those hasty digestions of thought
which were publish'd in my Youth;
a sentence not pronounc'd out of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
rigour, but from a cheerfull
obedience to the just authority of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience:
For that grave mistresse of
the World, <hi>Experience</hi> (in whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
Schoole those before the
Flood stay'd long, but we like wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
Children come thither late, yet
too soon are call'd out of it, and
fetch'd home by Death) hath taught
me, that the engendrings of unripe
age become abortive, and deform'd;
and that after obteining more years,
those must needs prophecy with ill
successe, who make use of their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
in Wine; That when the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Poets were valued as Prophets,
they were long and painfull in watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the correspondence of Causes,
ere they presum'd to foretell Effects:
and that 'tis a high presumption to
entertein a Nation (who are a Poets
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97590:30"/>
standing Guests, and require Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall
respect) with hasty provisions;
as if a Poet might imitate the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
dispatch of Faulconers, mount his
<hi>Pegasus,</hi> unhood his <hi>Muse,</hi> and with a
few flights, boast he hath provided a
feast for a Prince. Such posting upon
<hi>Pegasus</hi> I have long since forborn;
and during my journey in this Work
have mov'd with a flow place; that
I might make my surveyes as one that
travelled not to bring home the
names, but the proportion and nature
of things: and in this I am made wise
by two great examples; for the friends
of <hi>Virgil</hi> acknowledge he was many
years in doing honour to <hi>AEneas</hi> (still
contracting at night into a closer
force the abundance of his morning
strengths) and <hi>Statius</hi> rather seems
to boast then blush, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
he was twice Seven years in
renowning the War between <hi>Argos</hi>
and <hi>Thebes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next to the usefulnesse of Time
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97590:30"/>
(which here implies ripe Age) I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leev'd
pains most requisite to this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking:
for though painfulnesse in
Poets (according to the usuall negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of our Nation in examining,
and their diligence to censure) seems
alwayes to discover a want of naturall
force, and is traduc'd, as if Poesie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
the world no more then Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing;
whose onely grace is the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and facility of motion; and
whose perfection is not of such pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
consequence, that any man
can merit much by attaining it with
long labour: yet let them consider,
and they will find (nor can I stay
long ere I convince them in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
use of Poesie) the naturall
force of a Poet more apparent, by
but confessing that great forces ask
great labour in managing, then by
an arrogrant braving the world, when
he enters the field with his undisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd
first thoughts: For a wise Poet,
like a wise Generall, will not shew his
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97590:31"/>
strengths till they are in exact govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and order; which are not the
postures of chance, but proceed from
Vigilance and Labour.</p>
            <p>Yet to such painfull Poets some up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
the want of extemporary fury,
or rather <hi>Inspiration;</hi> a dangerous
word, which many have of late suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfully
us'd; and <hi>Inspiration</hi> is a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
Fit, deriv'd from the antient
Ethnick Poets, who then, as they
were Priests, were States-men too, and
probably lov'd Dominion; and as their
well dissembling of inspiration begot
them reverence then, equall to that
which was payd to Lawes; so these
who now professe the same fury, may
perhaps by such authentick example
pretend authority over the people; It
being not unreasonable to imagine,
they rather imitate the <hi>Greek</hi> Poets
then the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Prophets, since the
later were inspir'd for the use of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
and these, like the former, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
for themselves. But though
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:97590:31"/>
the antient Poets are excus'd, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the weak constitution of those De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities
from whom they took their Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;
and the frequent necessity of
dissembling for the ease of government;
yet these (who also from the chief to the
meanest are States-men and Priests, but
have not the luck to be Poets) should
not assume such saucy familiarity with
a true God.</p>
            <p>From the time and labour requir'd
to my Poem, let me proceed to my
Assistants; by which I shall not so
much attest my own weaknesse, as
discover the difficulties and greatness
of such a work. For when <hi>Solomon</hi>
made use of his Neighbours towards
his building, he lost no reputation,
nor by demanding those aids was
thought a lesser Prince; but rather
publish'd his Wisedome, in rightly
understanding the vast extent of his
enterprise: who likewise with as much
glory made use of Fellers of wood,
and Hewers of Stone, as of learned
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97590:32"/>
Architects: Nor have I refrain'd to
be oblig'd to men of any science, as
well mechanicall as liberall: Nor when
Memory (from that various and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
stock, with which all observers
are furnish'd that have had diversity
of life) presented me by chance with
any figure, did I lay it a side as uselesse,
because at that instant I was not skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to manage it artfully; but I have
staid and recorded such objects, till
by consulting with right Masters I
have dispos'd of them without mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake;
It being no more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hame to get
Learning at that very time, and from
the same Text; when, and by which,
we instruct others; then for a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Scout, discovering the Enemy,
to save his own life at a Passe, where
he then teacheas his Party to escape.</p>
            <p>In remembring mine own helps,
I have cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dered those which others
in the same necessity have taken; and
find that Writers (contrary to my
inclination) are apter to be beholding
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97590:32"/>
to Books then to men; not onely
as the first are more in their possession
(being more con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tant Companions
then dearest friends) but because they
commonly make such use of treasure
found in Books, as of other treasure
belonging to the Dead and hidden
under ground; for they dispose of
both with great secrecy, defacing the
shape or images of the one, as much
as of the other; through fear of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Originall of their stealth, or
abundance discovered. And the next
cause why Writers are more in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries
then in Company, is, that
Books are easily open'd, and learned
men are usually shut up by a froward
or envious humour of retention; or else
unfold themselves, so as we may reade
more of their weaknesse and vanity
then Wisdome; imitating the Holiday
custome in great cities, where the shops
of Chaundry and slight wares are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly
open, but those of solid and
staple merchandise are proudly lock'd
up.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:97590:33"/>
Nor indeed can it be expected that
all great Doctours are of so benigne a
nature, as to take pains in gaining
treasure (of which Knowledge is the
greatest) with intent to inrich others
so easily, as if they stood every where
with their Pockets spread, and ready
to be pickt: Nor can we reade of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Father, who so farre and secretly
adopted his Sonne to a Book of his
own writing, as that his Son might
be thought Authour of that written
Wit, as much as his Father was Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of him: Nor of any Husband
that to his darling Wife would so far
surrender his Wisedome, as that in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick,
he could endure to let her use
his Dictates, as if she would have
others think her wiser then himself.
By this remembrance of that usuall
parcimony in owners of Wit, towards
such as would make use of their plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
I lament the fortune of others, and
may wish the Reader to congratulate
mine; For I have found Friends as
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97590:33"/>
ready as Books, to regulate my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
or make them more correct,
easie, and apparent. But though I am
become so wise, by knowing my
self, as to believe the thoughts of
divers transcend the best which I
have written; yet I have admitted
from no man any change of my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe,
nor very seldome of my Sence;
For I resolv'd to have this Poem sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
and continue throughout, with
the same Complexion and Spirit;
though it appear but like a plain fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
of a neighbourly alliance, who mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
into the same moderate quality and
garb, and are fearfull of introducing
strangers of greater ranke, lest the shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
presence of such, might seem to
upbraid, and put all about them out of
countenance.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, that the Reader
may (whom Writers are fain to
court, draw in, and keep with artifice,
so shy men grow of Books) believe
me worthy of him, I cannot forbear
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97590:34"/>
to thank you in publick, for exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
correcting, and allowing this
Poem in parcels ere it arriv'd at the
contexture: by which you have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
the just degrees of proceeding
with Poets; who, during the gayetie
and wantonnesse of the Muse, are but
as children to Philosophers (though
of some Giant race) whose first
thoughts (wild, and roaming farre
off) must be brought home, watch'd,
and interrogated, and af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er they are
made more regular, be encourag'd
and prais'd for doing well, that they
may delight in aiming at perfection.
By such a Method the Muse is taught
to become Master of her own and
others strength: and who is he so
learn'd (how proud soever with being
cherish'd in the bosome of Fame)
that can hope, (when through the
severall wayes of Science, he seeks Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in her hidden walks) to make his
Journey short, unlesse he call you to
be his Guide? and who so guided can
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97590:34"/>
suspect his safety, even when he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
through the Enemy's countrey?
For such is the vast field of Learning,
where the learned (though not nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
enough to be an Army) lie as
small parties, maliciously in Ambush,
to destroy all new Men that look into
their Quarters. And from such, you,
and those you lead, are secure; because
you move not by common Maps but
have painfully made your own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect;
and travel now like the Sunne,
not to inform your self, but enlighten
the World.</p>
            <p>And likewise, when by the strict
survey and Government that hath been

               </gap>m, I shall think to
govern the Reader (who, though he
be noble, may perhaps judge of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Power like a very Commoner,
and rather approve Authority, when
it is in many, then in one) I must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him, that you had not alone the
trouble of establishing and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but injoy'd your intervalls and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:97590:35"/>
ease by two Colleagues; two that are
worthy to follow you into the Closets
of Princes; if the knowledge of Men
past, (of whom Books are the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
minds) or of the present (of whom
Conversation is the usefull and lawfull
Spy) may make up such greatnesse, as
is fit for great Courts: or if the raies
that proceed from the Poetick Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
be not a little too strong for the
sight of modern Monarchs who now
are too seldome taught in their youth,
like Eaglets to fortifie their eyes by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
soaring near the Sun. And though
this be here but my testimony, it is too
late for any of you to disclaim it; for
since you have made it valid by giving
yours of GONDIBERT under your
hands, you must be content to be us'd
by me, as Princes are by their prefer'd
Subjects, who in the very act of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Honour, return it to the giver;
as benefits receiv'd by the Creature
manifest the power, and redound to the
glory of the Creatour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:97590:35"/>
I am now, Sir, (to your great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
that have been thus ill and long
diverted) arriv'd at my last conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
which is, to satisfie those who
may inquire why I have taken so much
pains to become an Authour? or why
any man stayes so long sweating at the
fire of Invention, to dresse the food
of the Mind, when Readers have so
imperfect stomachs, as they either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
Books with over hasty Digesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or grow to loathe them from a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet?
And why I more especially made
my task an Heroick Poem? I shall
involve the two first Questions in one;
as submitting to be concern'd amongst
the generality of Writers; whose Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
being many, and now mine, we
must joyn forces to oppose them.</p>
            <p>Men are chiefly provok'd to the
toil of compiling Books, by love of
Fame, and often by officiousnesse of
Conscience, but seldome with expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Riches: for those that spend
time in writing to instruct others, may
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:97590:36"/>
find leasure to inform themselvs, how
mean the provisions are which busie
and studious minds can make for their
own sedentary bodies: And Learned
men (to whom the rest of the world
are but Infants) have the same foolish
affection in nourishing others minds,
as Pelicans in feeding their young;
which is, at the expence of the very
subsistence of Life. 'Tis then appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
they proceed by the instigation
of Fame or Conscience; and I believe
many are perswaded by the first (of
which I am One) and some are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the second. Nor is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of Fame so vain as divers have ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidly
imagin'd; Fame being (when
belonging to the Living) that which
is more gravely call'd, a steddy and
necessary reputation; and without it,
hereditary Power, or acquired great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
can never quietly govern the
World. 'Tis of the Dead a musicall
glory, in which God, the authour of
excellent goodnesse, vouchsafes to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:97590:36"/>
take a continuall share; For the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
virtues of g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eat men are
chiefly such of his works (mentioned
by King <hi>David)</hi> as perpetually praise
him: and the good fame of the Dead
prevails by example much more then
the reputation of the Living, because
the later is alwayes suspected by our
Envy, but the other is cheerfully al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
and religiously admir'd: for
Admiration (whose Eyes are ever
weak) stands still, and at gaze upon
great things acted farre off; but when
they are near, walks slightly away as
from familiar objects. Fame is to our
Sonnes a solid Inheritance, and not
unusefull to remote Posterity; and to
our Reason, 'tis the first, though but a
little taste, of Eternity.</p>
            <p>Those that write by the command
of Conscience (thinking themselves
able to instruct others, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
oblig'd to it) grow commonly the
most voluminous; because the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of Conscience are so incessant,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:97590:37"/>
that she is never satisfi'd with doing
enough: for such as be newly made the
captives of God (many appearing so
to themselves, when they first begin to
wear the fetters of Conscience) are like
common Slaves, when newly taken;
who, terrifi'd with a fancy of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
of absolute Masters, abuse their
diligence out of fear, and do ill, rather
then appear idle. And this may be the
cause why Libraries are more then
double-lin'd with Spirituall Books or
Tracts of Morality; the later being
the Spirituall Counsels of <hi>Lay-men;</hi>
and the newest of such great volumes
(being usually but transcriptions or
translations) differ so much from the
Antients, as later dayes from those of
old, which difference is no more then
an alteration of names, by removing
the <hi>Ethnicks</hi> to make way for the
<hi>Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nts.</hi> These are the effects of their
labours, who are provok'd to become
Authours, meerly out of Conscience;
and Conscience we may again averre
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:97590:37"/>
to be often so unskilfull and timorous,
that it seldome gives a wise and steddy
account of God; but grows jealous of
him, as of an Adversary, and is after
melancholy visions like a fearful Scout,
after he hath ill survey'd the Enemy,
who then makes incong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uous, long, and
terrible Tales.</p>
            <p>Having confess'd that the desire of
Fame made me a Writer; I must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
why in my riper age I chose to
gain it more especially by an Heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Poem; and the Heroick being
by most allow'd to be the most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
of Poems, I shall not need to
decide the quarrels of Poets about the
Degrees of Excellence in Poesie: but
'tis not amisse ere I avow the useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the science in generall (which
was the cause of my undertaking)
to remember the value it had from
the greatest and most worthy spirits
in all Ages: For I will not abstain
(though it may give me the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
but of common reading) to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97590:38"/>
mention, that <hi>Pisistratus,</hi> (though a
Tyrant) liv'd with the Praise and
dy'd with the Blessing of all <hi>Greece,</hi>
for gathering the scatter'd limbs of
<hi>Homer's</hi> Works into a Body; and
that Great <hi>Alexander,</hi> by publickly
conversing with it, attain'd the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
opinion of wit; the fame of
such inward forces conducing as
much to his Conquests, as his Armies
abroad: That the <hi>Athenian</hi> prisoners
were thought worthy of life and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for singing the Tragedies of <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides:</hi>
That <hi>Thebes</hi> was sav'd from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
by the Victors reverence to
the memory of <hi>Pindar:</hi> That the elder

               </hi>
and <hi>Laelius</hi> (no lesse renown'd) were
openly proud when the Romans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
they assisted <hi>Terence</hi> in his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies:
That <hi>Augustus</hi> (to whom the
mysteries of universall Empire were
more familiar then domestick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:97590:38"/>
to Modern Kings) made
<hi>Virgil</hi> the partner of his joyes, and
would have divided his businesse with
<hi>Horace:</hi> and that <hi>Lucan</hi> was the fear
and envy of <hi>Nero.</hi> If we approach
nearer our own times, we may add
the triumphall Entry which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
gave to <hi>Petrarch;</hi> and how much
<hi>Tasso</hi> is still the glory and delight of
<hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as in this hasty Muster of Poet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
and listing their confederates, I shall
by omitting many, deprive them of
that pay which is due from Fame; so
I may now by the opinion of some
Divines (whom notwithstanding I
will reverence in all their distinct ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
and fashions of the mind) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
held partiall and too bold, by adding
to the first number (though I range
them upon holy ground and aside)
<hi>Moses, David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> for their
Songs, Psalmes, and Anthemes: the
second being the acknowledg'd Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
of God, whom he had gain'd by
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:97590:39"/>
excellent Praises in sacred Poesie. And
I fear (since Poesie is the clearest light
by which they find the soul who seek
it) that Poets have in their fluent kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
diverted from the right use, and
spent too much of that spirituall talent
in the honour of mortall Princes: for
divine Praise (when in the high per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
as in Poets, and onely in them)
is so much the uttermost and whole of
Religious worship, that all other parts
of Devotion serve but to make it up.

            <p>After this contemplation, how ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
the voyce of Poesie hath
been to God, we may (by descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from Heaven to Earth) consider
how usefull it is to Men; and among
Men, Divines are the chief, because
ordain'd to temper the rage of humane
power by spirituall menaces, as by
sudden and strange threatnings, mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is frighted into reason; and they
are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ent hither as Liegers from God,
to conserve in stedfast motion the
slippery joynts of Government; and to
perswade an amity in divided Nations:
therefore to Divines I first addresse
my self; and presume to ask them,
why, ever since their Dominion was
first allow'd, at the great change of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:97590:40"/>
Religions, (though ours, more then
any, inculcates obedience, as an easie
Medicine to coole the impatient and
raging World into a quiet rest) man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
hath been more unruly then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
it being visible that Empire
decreas'd with the encrease of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity;
and that one weak Prince
did antiently su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fice to govern many
strong Nations: but now one little
Province is too hard for their own
wise King: and a small Republick
hath seventy years maintein'd thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
revolt to the disquiet of many Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs.
Or if Divines reply, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
expect the good effects of their
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fice, because their spirituall Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is not allow'd as absolute; then
it may be ask'd them more severely,
why 'tis not allow'd? for whereever
there hath been great degrees of power
(which hath been often, and long
in the Church) it discovers (though
worldly vicissitude be objected as an
excuse) that the Mannagers of such
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:97590:41"/>
power, since they endeavour'd not to
enlarge it, believ'd the increase un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous;
or were in acting, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving
that endeavour, either negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
or weak: For Power like the
hasty Vine, climbs up apace to the
Supporter; but if not skilfully attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ss'd, instead of spreading,
and bearing fruit, grows high, and
naked; and then (like empty title)
being soon uselesse to others, becomes
neglected, and unable to support it
self.</p>
            <p>But if Divines have fail'd in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
Princes (that is, of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
believ'd by them) yet they might
obliquely have rul'd them, in ruling
the People; by whom of late, Princes
have been govern'd; and they might
probably rule the People, because the
Heads of the Church (where ever
Christianity is preach'd) are Te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>chs
of Time; of which they command
the fourth Division; for to no lesse the
Sabbaths, and Dayes of Saints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:97590:41"/>
and during those dayes of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
triumph, Pulpits are Thrones;
and the people oblig'd to open their
Ears, and let in the ordinances and
commands of Preachers; who likewise
are not without some little Regency
throughout the rest of the Year; for
then they may converse with the
Laity, from whom they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
such respect (and respect soon
opens the door to perswasion) as
shew's their Congregations not deaf
in those holy seasons, when Speaking
predominates.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding these advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
the Pulpit hath little prevail'd;
for the World is in all Regions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd,
or shaken by disobedience; an
Engine with which the great Angels
(for such were the Devils, and had
faculties much more sublim'd then
Men) believ'd they could disorder
Heaven. And 'tis not want of capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
in the lower Auditory that makes
Doctrine so unsuccessfull; for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:97590:42"/>
are not simple, since the Gentry
(euen of strongest Education) lack
sufficient defence against them, and
are hourely surpris'd in (their common
Ambushes) their Shops: For on sacred
Dayes they walke gravely and sadly
from Temples, as if they had newly
bury'd their sinfull Fathers; at night
sleep as if they never needed forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
and rise with the next Sunne, to
lye in wait for the Noble, and the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.
And though these quiet Cous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
are amongst the People, esteem'd
their steddy Men; yet they honour the
Courage, and more active parts of
such disobedient Spirits, as disdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus tamely to deceive, attempt
bravely to rob the State; and the
State they believe (though the Helme
were held by Apostles) would alwayes
consist of such Arch-robbers, as who
ever strips them, but waves the tedious
satisfaction which the Lazy expect
from Laws, and comes a shorter way
to his own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:97590:42"/>
Thus unapt for obedience (in the
condition of Beasts whose appetite is
Liberty, and their Liberty a licence
of Lust) the People have often been,
since a long and notorious power
hath continu'd with Divines; whom
though with reverence we accuse for
mistaken Lenity; yet are we not so
cruell to expect they should behave
themselves to sinners like fierce <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas,</hi>
or preach with their Swords
drawn, to kill all they cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade:
But our meaning is, to shew
how much their Christian meekness
hath deceiv'd them in taming this
wilde Monster, the People; and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to rebuke them for neglecting the
assistance of Poets; and for upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Ethnicks, because the Poets
mannag'd their Religion; as if Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
could walk more prosperously
abroad then when Morality (respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and bare-headed as her Usher)
prepares the way: it being no less true
that during the Dominion of Poesie,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:97590:43"/>
a willing and peacefull obedience to
Superiours becalm'd the World; then
that obedience like the Marriage
yoke, is a restraint more needfull and
advantageous then liberty; and hath
the same reward of pleasant quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
which is antiently had, when
<hi>Adam,</hi> till his disobedience, enjoy'd
Paradise. Such are the effects of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Poesie which charm's the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with harmonious precepts; and
whose aid Divines should not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
since their Lord (the Saviour of
the World) vouchsaf'd to deliver his
Doctrine in Parabolicall Fictions.</p>
            <p>Those that be of next importance
are Leaders of Armies; and such I
measure not by the suffrages of the
People, who give them respect as
Indians worship the evil Spirit, rather
for fear of harm, then for affection;
but esteem them as the painfull Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectours,
and enlargers of Empire by
whom it actively moves; and such
active motion of Empire is as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:97590:43"/>
as the motion of the Sea where all
things would putrifie, and infect one
an other, if the Element were quiet;
so is it with mens minds on shore,
when that Element of greatnesse and
honour, <hi>Empire,</hi> stands still; of which
the largenesse is likewise as needfull,
as the vastnesse of the Sea; For God
ordain'd not huge Empire as proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
to the Bodies, but to the Minds
of Men; and the Minds of Men
are most monstrous, and require more
space for agitation and the hunting
of others, then the Bodies of Whales:

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fice requires
the uttermost aids of art, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and rescues the sword of Justice,
when 'tis wrested from supream Power
by Commotion) I am now address'd;
and must put them in mind (though
not upbraidingly) how much their
Mighty Predecessours were antiently
oblig'd to Poets; whose Songs (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
the praises of Conduct and
Valour) were esteem'd the chiefest
rewards of Victory; And since Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath made us prone to Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(by which we equall the best or
the worst) how much those Images of
Action prevail upon our minds,
which are delightfully drawn by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets:
For the greatest of the Grecian
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:97590:44"/>
Captains have confess'd, that their
Counsells have been made wise, and
their Courages warm, by <hi>Homer:</hi>
and since Praise is a Pleasure which
God hath invited, and with which he
often vouchsaf'd to be pleas'd when it
was sent him by his own Poet; why
is it not lawfull for virtuous men to
be cherish'd, and magnifi'd with
hearing their vigilance, Valour, and
good fortune (the latter being more
the immediate gift of Heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the effect of an unknown
cause) commended, and made eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
in Poesie? But perhaps the art of
praising Armies into great, and instant
action, by singing their former deeds
(an Art with which the Antients
made <hi>Empire</hi> so large) is too subtle
for Modern <hi>Leaders;</hi> who as they
cannot reach the heighths of Poesie,
must be content with a narrow space
of Dominion: and narrow Dominion
breeds evil, peevish, and vexatious
minds, and a nationall self-opinion,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97590:45"/>
like simple Jewish arrogance; and
the Jews were extraordinary proud in
a very little Countrey: For men in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
governments are but a kind of
Prisoners; and Prisoners by long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
grow wicked, malicious to all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and foolish esteemers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
as if they had wrong in not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
every thing which they can one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
see out of Windowes.</p>
            <p>Our last application is to <hi>Statesmen;</hi>
and Makers of <hi>Laws;</hi> who may be
reasonably reduc'd to one; since the
second differ no more from the first,
then Judges (the Copies of <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers)</hi>
differ from their Originals:
for Judges, like all bold Interpteters,
by often altering the Text, make it
quite new; and <hi>States-men</hi> (who differ
not from Law-makers in the act, but
in the manner of doing) make new
Laws presumptuously without the
consent of the People; but <hi>Legislators</hi>
more civilly seem to whistle to the
Beast, and stroak him into the Yoke:
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:97590:45"/>
and in the Yoke of State, the People
(with too much pampering) grow
soon unruly and draw awry; Yet
<hi>States-men</hi> and <hi>Iudges</hi> (whose busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is governing, and the thing to be
govern'd is the People) have amongst
us (we being more proud and mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
then any other famous Nation)
look'd gravely upon Poetry, and with
a negligence that betray'd a Norther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ignorance; as if they believ'd
they could perform their work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it. But Poets (who with wise di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
study the People, and have in
all ages, by an insensible influence go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
their manners) may justly smile
when they perceive that <hi>Divines, Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Armies, States-men</hi> and <hi>Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
think <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>Sword,</hi> or
(which is unwritten <hi>Law,</hi> and a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
confederacy of Chiefs) <hi>Policy,</hi> or
<hi>Law</hi> (which is written, but seldome
rightly read) can give, without the
help of the <hi>Muses,</hi> a long and quiet
satisfaction in government: For <hi>Religion</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:97590:46"/>
is to the wicked and faithlesse (who
are many) a jurisdiction against which
they readily rebell: because it rules se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely,
yet promiseth no worldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
for obedience; obedience
being by every humane power invited
with assurances of vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ible advantage.
The Good (who are but few) need
not the power of <hi>Religion</hi> to make
them better, the power of <hi>Religion</hi>
proceeding from her threatnings, which
though mean Weapons, are fitly us'd,
since she hath none but base Enemies.
We may observe too, that all Virtuous
men are so taken up with the rewards
of Heaven, that they live as if out of the
World; and no government receives
assistance from any man meerly as he is
good; but as that goodnesse is active
in temporall things.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sword</hi> is in the hand of <hi>Iustice</hi>
no guard to Government, but then
when <hi>Iustice</hi> hath an Army for her
own defence; and Armies, if they
were not pervertible by Faction, yet
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:97590:46"/>
are to Common-wealths like Kings
Physicians to poor Patients; who
buy the cure of their disordered bodies
at so high a rate, that they may be said
to change their Sicknesse for Famine.
<hi>Policy</hi> (I mean of the Living, not of
the Dead; the one being the last rules
or designs governing the Instant;
the other, those Laws that began Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire)
is as mortall as <hi>States-men</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
whose incessant labour make
that Hectick Fever of the mind,
which insensibly dispatches the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
and when we trace <hi>States-men</hi>
through all the Histories of Courts,
we find their Inventions so unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to those that succed at the
Helm, or so much envy'd as they
scarce last in authority till the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
are buried: and change of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
in <hi>States-men</hi> (their designs being
the Weapons by which States are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended)
grows as destructive to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
as a continuall change of
various Weapons is to Armies; which
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:97590:47"/>
must receive with ruine any sudden
assault, when want of practise makes
unactivenesse. We cannot urge that
the ambition of States-men (who are
obnoxious to the People) doth much
disorder Government; because the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
anger, by a perpetuall coming
in of new Oppressours is so diverted in
considering those whom their Eyes
but lately left, as they have not time
enough to rise for the Publick: and
evill successours to Power are in the
troubled Stream of State like succed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Tides in Rivers, where the mud
of the former is hidden by the filth
of the last.</p>
            <p>Laws, if very antient, grow as
doubtfull and difficult as Letters on
bury'd Marble, which onely Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
reade; but if not Old, they want
that reverence which is therefore paid
to the virtues of Ancestours, because
their crimes come not to our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance;
and yet great Men must be
long dead whose ills are forgotten. If
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:97590:47"/>
               <hi>Laws</hi> be New, they must be made
either by very Angels, or by Men
that have some vices; and those being
seen, make their Virtues suspected;
for the People no more esteem able
men, whose defects they know,
(though but errours incident to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity)
then an Enemy values a
strong Army having experience of
their Errours. And new Laws are held
but the projects of necessitous Power,
new Nets spread to intangle us; the
Old being accounted too many,
since most are believ'd to be made
for Forfeitures: and such letting of
bloud (though intended by Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers
for our health) is to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
alwayes out of Season: for those
that love life with too much Passion
(and Money is the life-bloud of the
People) ever fear a Consumption.
But, be Law-makers as able as Nature
or Experience (which is the best Art)
can make them; yet, though I will
not yield the Wicked to be wiser then
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97590:48"/>
the Virtuous, I may say, offences are
too hard for the Laws, as some Beasts
are too wylie for their Hunters; and
that Vice overgrows Virtue, as much
as Weeds grow faster then medicinable
Herbs: or rather that Sinne, like the
fruitfull slime of <hi>Nilus,</hi> doth increase
into so many various shapes of Serpents
(whose walks and retreats are winding
and unknown) that even <hi>Iustice</hi> (the
painfull pursuer of Mischief) is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
weary and amaz'd.</p>
            <p>After these Meditations, me thinks
Government resembles a Ship, where
though <hi>Divines, Leaders</hi> of <hi>Armies,
States-men,</hi> and <hi>Iudges</hi> are the trusted
Pilots; yet it moves by the means of
Winds, as uncertain as the breath of
Opinion; and is laden wIth the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
a Freight much looser and more
dangerous then any other living
stowage; being as troublosome in
fair weather, as Horses in a Storm.
And how can these Pilots steddily
maintain their Course to the Land
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:97590:48"/>
of Peace and Plenty, since they are
often divided at the Helm? For <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi>
(when they consider great
<hi>Chiefs)</hi> suppose Armies to be sent from
God for a temporary Plague, not for
continuall Jurisdiction; and that Gods
extreme punishments (of which, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
be the most violent) are ordained
to have no more lastingnesse then the
extremes in Nature. They think (when
they consider <hi>States-men</hi>) Policy hath
nothing of the Dove, and being all
Serpent, is more dangerous, then the
dangers it pretends to prevent: and
that out-witting (by falshood and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption)
adverse States, or the People
(though the people be often the greater
enemy and more perilsome being near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est)
is but giving reputation to Sinne,
and that to maintain the Publick by
Politick evils, is a base prostitution of
Religion, and the prostitution of
Religion is that unpardonable whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
which so much anger'd the
Prophets. They think <hi>Law</hi> nothing
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:97590:49"/>
but the Bible forcibly usurp'd by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
Lawyers, and disguis'd in a
Paraphrase more obscure then the
Text; and that 'tis onely want of just
reverence to Religion which doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
us to the charges and vexations
of <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Leaders</hi> of <hi>Armies,</hi> accuse <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi>
for unwisely raising the Warre of
the World by opposite Doctrine, and
for being more indiscreet in thinking
to appease it by perswasion; forgetting
that the dispatchfull ending of Warre
is blows; and that the naturall region
for Disputes, when Nations are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
(though by Religion) is the
Field of Battel, not Schools and
Academies; which they believe by
their restlesse controversies lesse civil
then Camps; as intestine Quarrel is
held more barbarous then forreign
War. They think <hi>States-men</hi> to them
(unlesse dignifi'd with Military office)
but mean Spies that like <hi>African foxes</hi>
(who attend on <hi>Lions,</hi> ranging before
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:97590:49"/>
and about, for their valiant prey)
shrink back till the danger be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd,
and then with insatiate hunger
come in for a share: Yet sometimes
with the Eye of Envy (which inlarges
objects like a multiplying-glasse) they
behold these States-men, and think
them immense as Whales; the motion
of whose vast bodies can in a peacefull
calm trouble the Ocean till it boil;
after a little hasty wonder, they consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them again with disdain of their
low constraints at Court; where they
must patiently endure the little follics
of such small favourites as wait even
near the wisest Thrones; so fantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
weak seem Monarchs in the
sicknesse of Care (a fever in the head)
when for the humorous pleasure of
Diversity, they descend from Purple
beds, and seek their ease upon the
ground. These great Leaders say also
that Law moves slowly, as with fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
feet, and is too tedious in redresse
of wrongs; whilst in Armies, Justice
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:97590:50"/>
seems to ride poste, and overtakes
Offenders ere the contagion of crimes
can infect others: and though in Courts
and Cities great men fence often with
her, and with a forcive slight put by
her sword; yet when she retires to
<hi>Camps,</hi> she is in a posture not onely to
punish the offences of particular great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but of injurious Nations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>States-men</hi> look on <hi>Divines</hi> as men
whose long solitude and Meditations
on Heaven hath made them Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
upon Earth: and 'tis acquaintance
with the World, and knowledge of
Man that makes abilities of Ruling:
for though it may be said that a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
belief of Doctrine would bege<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
obedience (which is the uttermost
design of governing) yet since di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of Doctrine doth distract all
Auditours, and makes them doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
dispose their obedience (even
towards spirituall powers, on which
many would have the temporall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend)
therefore <hi>States-men</hi> think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:97590:50"/>
more fit to manage <hi>Empire</hi>
then <hi>Divines;</hi> whose usefulnesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in perswasion; and perswasion is
the last medicine (being the most
desperate) which <hi>States-men</hi> apply to
the distemper of the people: for their
distemper is madnesse, and Madnesse
is best cur'd with terrour and force.
They think that <hi>Leaders</hi> of <hi>Armies</hi> are
to great Empire, as great Rivers to
the Continent; which make an easie
accesse of such benefits as the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis
(the seat of Power) would else at
vast distances with difficulty reach:
yet often like proud Rivers when they
swell, they destroy more by once over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing
their borders at home, then
they have in long time acquir'd from
abroad: They are to little Empire like
the Sea to low Islands; by nature a
defense from Forreigners, but by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
when they rage, a deluge to
their own shore. And at all seasons
<hi>States-men</hi> believe them more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to government then themselves:
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:97590:51"/>
for the popularity of States-men is not
so frequent as that of Generalls; or if
by rare sufficiency of Art it be gain'd,
yet the force of Crouds in Cities,
compar'd to the validity of men of
Arms and Discipline, would appear
like the great number of Sheep to a
few Wolves, rather a cause of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
then of Terrour. They think that
chief Ministers of Law by unskilfull
integrity, or love of popularity (which
shews the Mind as meanly born
as bred) so earnestly pursue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of the Peoples right, that they
neglect the publick Interest; and
though the Peoples right and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Interest be the same, yet usually
by the People, the Ministers of Law
mean Private-men, and by the other,
the State; and so the State and the
People are divided, as we may say a
man is divided within himself, when
reason and passion (and Passion is
folloy) dispute about consequent
actions; and if we were call'd to assist
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:97590:51"/>
at such intestine warre, we must side
with Reason, according to our duty
by the Law of Nature; and Natures
Law, though not written in Stone (as
was the Law of Religion) hath taken
deep impression in the Heart of
Man, which is harder then marble of
Mount Sinai.</p>
            <p>Chief Ministers of Law think, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
in Government, should like the
Penall Statutes, be choicely and but
seldome us'd; for as those Statutes are
rigorously inquisitive after veniall
faults (punishing our very manners
and weak constitution, as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent
appetite; so Divines (that are
made vehement with contemplating
the dignity of the Offended (which
is God) more then the frailty of the
Offender) govern as if men could
be made Angels ere they come to
Heaven.</p>
            <p>Great Ministers of Law think
likewise that Leaders of Armies are
like ill Physicians, onely fit for despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:97590:52"/>
cures, whose blindnesse calls in
the assistance of Fortune, during the
fears and troubles of Art: Yet the
health they give to a distempered State
is not more accidentall then the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of it is uncertain; because
they often grow vain with successe,
and encourage a restor'd State to such
hazards, as shew like irregularity of
life in other recover'd bodies; such as
the cautions and antient gravity of
<hi>Law</hi> disswades: For <hi>Law</hi> (whose tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
design is safety) rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
by constancy of Medicine (like
a continu'd Diet) diseases in the
Body-politick, then depends after a
permitted Sicknesse upon the chance
of recovery. They think <hi>States-men</hi>
strive to be as much Judges of Law
as themselves, being chief Ministers
of Law, are Judges of the People;
and that even good <hi>States-men</hi> pervert
the Law more then evil Judges: For
Law was antiently meant a Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Armour, and the people took it
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:97590:52"/>
as from the Magazin of Justice, to keep
them safe from each others violence:
but <hi>States-men</hi> use it as offensive Arms,
with which, in forraging to get relief for
Supreme Power, they often wound the
Publick.</p>
            <p>Thus we have first observ'd the
Four chief aids of Government, <hi>(Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
Arms, Policy,</hi> and <hi>Law)</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectively
apply'd, and then we have
found them weak by an emulous
warre amongst themselves: it follows
next, we should introduce to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
those principall aids (still ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the People our direct object)
some collaterall help; which I will
safely presume to consist in Poesie.</p>
            <p>We have observ'd that the People
since the latter time of Christian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
are more unquiet then in former
Ages: so disobedient and fierce, as if
they would shake off the antient im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of being Beasts, by shewing
their Masters they know their own
strength: and we shall not erre by
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:97590:53"/>
supposing that this conjunction of
Fourfould Power hath faild in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of authority, by a misapplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for it hath rather endeavoured
to prevail upon their bodies, then their
minds; forgetting that the martiall
art of constraining is the best; which
assaults the weaker part; and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
part of the people is their minds;
for want of that which is the Mindes
onely Strength, <hi>Education;</hi> but their
Bodies are strong by continuall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
for Labour is the Education
of the body. Yet when I mention the
misapplication of force, I should have
said, they have not onely faild by that,
but by a main errour; Because the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
on which they should work is
the Mind; and the Mind can never
be constraind, though it may be gain'd
by Perswasion: And since perswasion is
the principall Instrument which one can
bring to fashion the brittle and misha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
mettal of the Mind; none are so
fit aids to this important works, as
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:97590:53"/>
Poets: whose art is more then any
enabled with a voluntary, and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
assistance of Nature; and whose
operations are as resistlesse secret, easie,
and subtle, as is the influence of
Planets.</p>
            <p>I must not forget (left I be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Vigilance of the Reader)
that I have profe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s'd not to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the beauty of virtue in my Poem,
with hope to perswade common men;
and I have said that <hi>Divines</hi> have fail'd
in discharging their share of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by depending upon the effects
of Perswasion; and that States-men in
managing the people rely not upon
the perswasion of Divines, but upon
force. In my despair of reducing the
minds of Common men, I have not
confest any weaknesse of Poesie in
the generall Science; but rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
the particular strength of the
Heroick; which hath a force that
over-matches the infancy of such
minds as are not enabled by degrees
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:97590:54"/>
of Education; but there are lesser for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in other kinds of Poesie, by which
they may train, and prepare their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings;
and Princes, and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
being reform'd and made Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
by the Heroick, will be predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
lights, which the People cannot

               </gap>eams till they shine, and make day to
themselves.</p>
            <p>In saying that <hi>Divines</hi> have vainly
hop'd to continue the peace of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by perswasion, I have imply'd
such perswasions as are accompany'd
with threatnings, and seconded by force;
which are the perswasions of Pulpits;
where is presented to the Obstinate,
Hell after Death; and the civill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
during Life constrains such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
as the Church doth ordain.
But the perswasions of Poesie in stead
of menaces, are Harmonious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull
in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inuations, and never any
constraint; unlesse the ravishment of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:97590:54"/>
Reason may be call'd Force. And such
Force, (contrary to that which <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
Commanders, States-men,</hi> and
<hi>Lawyer's</hi> use) begets such obedience as
is never weary or griev'd.</p>
            <p>In declaring that <hi>States-men</hi> think
not the State wholly secure by such
manners as are bred from the perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Divines,</hi> but more willingly
make Government rely upon military
force; I have neither concluded that
Poets are unprofi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

think so; for the wisdome of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets,
would first make the Images of
Virtue so amiable that her beholders
should not be able to look off (ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
gently, and delightfully infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

then when the mind is conquer'd,
like a willing Bride, Force should so
behave it self, as noble Husbands use
their power: that is, by letting their

Duty: But to such an easie go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
neither the People (which
are subjects to Kings and States) nor
Wives (which are subject to Husbands)
can peacefully yield, unlesse they are
first conquer'd by Virtue; and the
Conquests of Virtue be never easie,
but where her sorces are commanded
by Poets.</p>
            <p>It may be objected that the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Peoples minds (from
whence Virtuous manners are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd)
by the severall kinds of Poesie
(of which the <hi>Dramatick</hi> hath been
in all Ages very successfull) is opposite
to the receiv'd opinion, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ought to be continu'd in ignorance;
a Maxime sounding like the little
subtletie of one that is a States-man
onely by Birth or Beard, and merits
not his place by much thinking; For
Ignorance is rude, censorious, jealous,
obstinate, and proud; these being
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:97590:55"/>
exactly the ingredients of which Diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
is made; and Obedience
proceeds from ample consideration,
of which knowledge consists; and
knowledge will soon put into one
Scale the weight of oppression, and
in the other, the heavie burden which
Disobedience layes on us in the effects
of civill Warre: and then even Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
will seem much lighter, when the
hand of Supreme Power binds up our
Load, and layes it artfully on us,
then Disobedience (the Parent of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>usion)
when we all load one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
in which every one irregularly
increases his fellows burden, to lessen
his own.</p>
            <p>Others may object that Poesie on
our Stago, or the Heroick in Musick
(for so the latter was antiently us'd)
is prejudiciall to a State; as begetting
Levity, and giving the People too
great a diversion by pleasure and
mirth. To these (if they be worthy of
Satisfaction) I reply; That whoever
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:97590:56"/>
in Government endeavours to make
the People serious and grave, (which
are attributes that may become the
Peoples <hi>Representatives,</hi> but not the
People) doth practise a new way to
enlarge the State, by making every
Subject a <hi>States-man:</hi> and he that
means to govern so mournfully (as
it were, without any Musick in his
Dominion) must lay but light bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
on his Subjects; or else he wants
the ordinary wisdome of those, who
to their Beasts that are much loaden
whistle all the day to encourage their
Travail. For that supreme power
which expects a firm obedience in
those, who are not us'd to rejoycing,
but live sadly, as if they were still pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>unerall of peace, hath
little skill in contriving the lasting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Government, which is the
principall work of Art; And lesse
hath that Power consider'd Nature;
as if such new austerity did seem to
tax, even her, for want of gravity in
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:97590:56"/>
bringing in the Spring so merrily with
a musicall variety of Birds; And such
sullen power doth forget that Battels
(the most solemne and serious businesse
of Death) are begun with Trumpets
and Fifes; and antiently were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd
with more diversity of Musick.
And that the Grecian Laws (Laws
being the gravest endeavour of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Councels, for the ease of Life)
were long before the Dayes of <hi>Ly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
(to make them more pleasant to
memory) publish'd in Verse: And
that the wise <hi>Athenians</hi> (dividing into
Three parts the publick Revenew)
expended one in playes and Showes,
to divert the people from meeting to
consult of their Rulers merit, and the
defects of Government: And that the
<hi>Romans</hi> had not so long continu'd
their Empire, but for the same diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ions,
at a vaster charge.</p>
            <p>Again, it may be objected, that the
precepts of Christian Religion are
sufficient towards our regulation, by
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:97590:57"/>
appointment of manners; and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the ease of Life, by imposing
obedience; so that the morall assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Poesie, is but vainly intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
To this I may answer, that as
no man should suspect the sufficiency
of Religion by its unsuccessfulnesse, so if
the unsuccessfulnesse be confess'd, we
shall as little disparage Religion, by
bringing in more aids when tis in
action, as a Generall dishonours him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by endeavouring with more of his
own Forces to make sure an attempt
that hath a while miscarri'd: For Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esie,
which (like contracted <hi>Essences</hi>
seems the utmost strength and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of Nature) is as all good Arts,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ubservient to Religion; all marching
under the same Banner, though of
lesse discipline and esteem. And as
Poesie is the best Expositour of Nature
(Nature being mysterious to such as
use not to consider) so Nature is the
best Interpreter of God; and more
cannot be said of Religion. And when
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:97590:57"/>
the Judges of Religion (which are
the Chiefs of the Church) neglect the
help of Moralists in reforming the
People (and Poets are of all Moralists
the most usefull) they give a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
against the Law of Nature: For
Nature performs all things by corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent
aids and harmony. And
'tis injurious not to think Poets the
most usefull Moralists; for as Poesie
is adorn'd and sublim'd by Musick,
which makes it more pleasant and
acceptable; so morality is sweetned
and made more amiable by Poesie.
And the Austerity of some Divines
may be the cause why Religion hath
not more prevaild upon the manners
of Men: for great Doctours should
rather comply with things that please
(as the wise Apostle did with Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies)
then lose a Proselyte. And even
<hi>Honour</hi> (taught by morall Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
but more delightfully infus'd
by Poets) will appear (notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the sad severity of some later
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:97590:58"/>
Divines) no unsafe Guide towards
Piety; for it is as wary and nice
as <hi>Conscience,</hi> though more cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and courageous. And however <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
be more pleasing to flesh and
blood, because in this World it find's
applause; yet 'tis not so mercinary as
Piety: for Piety (being of all her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
inwardly assur'd) expects a
reward in Heaven; to which all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
payments compar'd, are but Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
and Sand.</p>
            <p>And it appears that Poesie hath
for its naturall prevailings over the
Understandings of Men (sometimes
making her conquests with easie
plainnesse, like native countrey beauty)
been very successfull in the most grave,
and important occasions that the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
of States or Mankinde have
produc'd. For it may be said that
<hi>Demosthenes</hi> sav'd the <hi>Athenians</hi> by
the Fable or Parable of the Doggs
and Wolves, in answer to King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips</hi>
proposition; And that <hi>Menenius
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:97590:58"/>
Agrippa</hi> sav'd the Senate, if not
<hi>Rome,</hi> by that of the Belly and the
Hands: and that even our Saviour
was pleas'd (as the most prevalent way
of Doctrine) wholly to use such kind
of Parables in his converting, or
saving of Souls; it being written,
<hi>Without a Parable spake he not to them.</hi>
And had not the learned Apostle
thought the wisdome of Poets wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
his remembrance, and instructive,
not onely to Heathens, but to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
he had not cited <hi>Epimenides</hi> to
the <hi>Cretans,</hi> as well as <hi>Aratus</hi> to the
<hi>Athenians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot also be ignorant, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
(whose consciencious Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
amazes and discourages others
Devotion) will accuse Poets as the
Admirers of Beauty, and Inventours,
or Provokers of that which by way
of aspersion they call <hi>Love.</hi> But such,
in their first accusation seem to
look carelesly and unthankfully upon
the wonderfull works of God; or else
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:97590:59"/>
through low education, or age, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
incompetent Judges of what is
the chief of his Works upon Earth.
And Poets, when they praise Beauty,
are at least as lawfully thankfull to
God, as when they praise Seas, Woods,
Rivers, or any other parts that make
up a prospect of the World. Nor can
it be imagin'd but that Poets in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them, praise wholly the Maker;
and so in praising Beauty: For that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
who believes she is prais'd when
her Beauty is commended, may as
well suppose that Poets think she
created her self: And he that praises
the inward Beauty of Women,
which is their Virtue, doth more
perform his duty then before: for
our envious silence in not approving,
and so encouraging what is good, is
the cause that Vice is more in fashion
and countenance then Virtue. But
when Poets praise that which is not
Beauty, or the Mind which is not
virtuous, they erre through their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:97590:59"/>
or by flattery; and flattery is a
crime so much more prosperous in
others who are Companions to Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that it may be held in Poets ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Kindnesse then Design.</p>
            <p>They who accuse Poets as Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of Love, are Enemies to Nature;
and all affronts to Nature are offences
to God, as insolencies to all subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Officers of the Crown are rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
to the King. Love (in the most
obnoxious interpretation) is Nature's
Preparative to her greatest Work,
which is the making of Life. And
since the severest Divines of these
later times have not been asham'd
publickly to command and define
the most secret duties, and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Love in the Married; why
should not Poets civilly endeavour to
make a friendship between the Guests
before they meet, by teaching them
to dignifie each other with the utmost
of estimation? And Marriage in Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
were as rude and unprepar'd as
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:97590:60"/>
the hasty elections of other Creatures,
but for acquaintance and conversation
before it: and that must be an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of Minds, not of Bodies; and of
the Mind, Poesie is the most naturall
and delightfull Interpreter.</p>
            <p>When neither Religion (which is
our Art towards God) nor Nature
(which is Gods first Law to Man,
though by Man least study'd) nor
when Reason (which is Nature, and
made Art by Experience) can by the
Enemies of Poesie be sufficiently urg'd
against it; then some (whose froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
will not let them quit an evil
cause) plead written Authority. And
though such authority be a Weapon,
that even in the Warre of Religion,
distress'd Disputers take up, as their
last shift; yet here we would protest
against it, but that we find it makes
a false defence, and leaves the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
more open. This authority (which
is but single too) is from <hi>Plato;</hi> and
him some have maliciously quoted; as
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:97590:60"/>
if in his feign'd Common-wealth he
had banish'd all Poets. But <hi>Plato</hi> saies
nothing against Poets in generall; and
in his particular quarrel (which is to
<hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Hesiod)</hi> onely condemnes
such errours as we mention'd in the
beginning of this <hi>Preface,</hi> when we
look'd upon the Antients. And those
errours consist in their abasing Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
by representing the Gods in
evill proportion, and their <hi>Heroes</hi>
with as unequal Characters; and so
brought Vices into fashion, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixing
them with the Virtues of
great Persons. Yet even during this
divine anger of <hi>Plato,</hi> he concludes
not against Poesie, but the Poems
then most in request: for these be the
words of his Law. <hi>If any Man (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ability to imitate what he pleases)
imitate in his Poems both good and evil,
let him be reverenc'd, as a sacred admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and pleasant Person; but be it
likewise known, he must have no place
in our Common-wealth.</hi> And yet before
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:97590:61"/>
his banishment, he allows him, <hi>the
honour of a Diadem, and sweet Odours
to anoint his Head:</hi> and afterwards
sayes, <hi>Let us make use of more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
though more severe, and lesse
pleasant Poets, who can imitate that
which is for the honour and benefit
of the Common-wealth.</hi> But those who
make use of this just indignation of
<hi>Plato</hi> to the unjust scandall of Poesie,
have the common craft of false Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
inlarging every circumstance,
when it may hurt, and concealing all
things that may defend him they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
For they will not remember
how much the Scholar of <hi>Plato</hi> (who
like an absolute Monarch over Arts,
hath almost silenc'd his Master
throughout the Schools of Europe)
labours to make Poesie universally
current, by giving Laws to the Science:
Nor will they take notice in what
dignity it continu'd whilst the <hi>Greeks</hi>
kept their Dominion or Language;
and how much the <hi>Romans</hi> cherish'd
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:97590:61"/>
even the publick repetition of <hi>Verses</hi>
Nor will they vouchsafe to observe
(though <hi>Iuvenal</hi> take care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
it) how gladly all <hi>Rome</hi> (during
that exercise) ranne to the voyce of
<hi>Statius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus having taken measure
(though hastily) of the extent of those
great Professions that in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
contribute to the necessities,
ease, and lawfull pleasures of Men;
and finding Poesie as usefull now,
as the Antients found it towards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and happinesse; I will, Sir,
(unlesse with these two Books you
return me a discouragement) cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
proceed: and though a little time
would perfect the Third, and make it
fit for the Presse; I am resolv'd ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rather
to hazard the inconvenience
which expectation breeds (for divers
with no ill satisfaction have had a
taste of GONDIBERT)
then endure that violent envy which
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:97590:62"/>
assaults all Writers whilst they live;
though their Papers be but fill'd
with very negligent and ordinary
thoughts: and therefore I delay
the publication of any part of the

that when I am in another World
(though not in the common sense of
dying) I shall find my Readers
even the Poets of the present Age
as temperate and benigne as we are
all to the Dead, whose remote

And now, Sir, to end with

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F to commend your Poem,
I should onely say (in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
terms) that in the
choice of your Argument,
the disposition of the parts, the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the Characters of your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
the Dignity and Vigour of your
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:97590:64"/>
Expression you have performed all
the parts of various experience, ready
memory, clear judgement, swift and
well govern'd fancy, though it were
enough for the truth, it were too little
for the weight and credit of my testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.
For I lie open to two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
one of an incompetent, the
other of a corrupted Witnesse. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent,
because I am not a Poet;
and corrupted with the Honour done
me by your <hi>PREFACE.</hi> The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
obliges me to say something (by
the way) of the Nature and differences
of Poesie.</p>
            <p>As Philosophers have divided the
Universe (their subject) into three
Regions, <hi>Celestial, AEriall,</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restriall;</hi>
so the Poets (whose work
it is by imitating humane life, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull
and measur'd lines, to avert
men from vice, and encline them to
virtuous and honourable actions) have
lodg'd themselves in the three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of Mankind, <hi>Court, City,</hi> and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:97590:64"/>
               <hi>Countrey</hi> correspondent in some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
to those three Regions of the
World. For there is in Princes and
men of conspicuous power (antiently
called <hi>Heroes)</hi> a lustre and influence
upon the rest of men, resembling that
of the Heavens; and an insincerenesse,
inconstancy, and troublesome humour
of those that dwell in populous Cities,
like the mobility, blustring, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity
of the Air; and a plainnesse, and
(though dull) yet a nutritive faculty in
rurall people, that endures a compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
with the Earth they labour.</p>
            <p>From hence have proceeded three
sorts of Poesie; <hi>Heroick, Scomma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi>
and <hi>Pastorall.</hi> Every one of
these is distinguish'd again in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of <hi>Representation,</hi> which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
is <hi>Narrative,</hi> wherein the Poet
himself relateth, and sometimes <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick,</hi>
as when the persons are every
one adorned and brought upon the
Theatre, to speak and act their own
parts. There is therefore neither more
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:97590:65"/>
nor lesse then six sorts of Poesie. For
the Heroick Poem narrative (such
as is yours) is called an <hi>Epick Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eme;</hi>
The Heroick Poeme Dram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick,
is <hi>Tragedy.</hi> The Scomma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Narrative, is <hi>Satyre;</hi> Drammatick
is <hi>Comedy.</hi> The Pastorall narrative, is
called simply <hi>Pastorall</hi> (antiently <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colick</hi>)
the same Dramatick, <hi>Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Comedie.</hi> The Figure therefore of
an Epick Poem, and of a Tragedy,
ought to be the same, for they differ
no more but in that they are pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by one, or many persons. Which
I insert to justifie the figure of yours,
consisting of five books divided into
Songs or Cantoes, as five Acts divided
into Scenes has ever been the approved
figure of a Tragedy.</p>
            <p>They that take for Poesie what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is writ in Verse, will think this
division imperfect, and call in Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
Epigrammes, Eclogues, and the
like pieces (which are but Essayes,
and parts of an entire Poeme) and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:97590:65"/>
reckon <hi>Empedocles,</hi> and <hi>Lucretius</hi> (na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
Philosophers) for Poets, and
the morall precepts of <hi>Phocylides,
Theognis,</hi> and the Quatrains of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brach,</hi>
and the History of <hi>Lucan,</hi> and
others of that kind amongst Poems;
bestowing on such Writers for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
the name of Poets, rather
then of Historians or Philosophers.
But the subject of a Poem is the
manners of men, not naturall causes;
manners presented, not dictated; and
manners feigned (as the name of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esie
imports) not found in men. They
that give entrance to Fictions writ in
prose, erre not so much, but they
erre. For Poesie requireth delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
not onely of fiction, but of
stile; in which if prose contend with
Verse, it is with disadvantage (as it
were) on foot, against the strength and
wings of <hi>Pegasus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Verse amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi> was
appropriated antiently to the service
of their Gods and was the Holy stile;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:97590:66"/>
the stile of the Oracles; the stile of the
Laws; and the stile of men that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickly
recommended to their Gods,
the vows and thanks of the people;
which was done in their holy Songs
called Hymns; and the Composers
of them were called Prophets and
Priests before the name of Poet was
known. When afterwards the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
of that stile was observed, the
Poets chose it as best becoming their
high invention. And for the Antiquity
of Verse it is greater then the Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Letters. For it is certain <hi>Cadmus</hi>
was the first that (from <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> a
countrey that neighboureth <hi>Iudea</hi>)
brought the use of Letters into Greece.
But the service of the Gods, and the
laws (which by measured Sounds were
easily committed to the memory) had
been long time in use, before the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall
of <hi>Cadmus</hi> there.</p>
            <p>There is besides the grace of stile,
another cause why the antient Poets
chose to write in measured language,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:97590:66"/>
which is this. Their Poems were made
at first with intention to have them
sung, as well Epique, as Dramatique
(which custome hath been long time
laid aside, but began to be revived in
part, of late years in Italy) and could
not be made commensurable to the
Voyce or instruments, in Prose; the
wayes and motions whereof are so
uncertain and undistinguished, (like
the way and motion of a Ship in
the Sea) as not onely to discompose the
best Composers, but also to disappoint
sometimes the most attentive Reader,
and put him to hunt counter for the
sense. It was therefore necessary for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
in those times, to write in Verse.</p>
            <p>The verse which the Greeks, and
Latines (considering the nature of
their own languages) found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
most grave, and for an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pique
Poem most decent, was their
<hi>Hexameter;</hi> a Verse limited, not onely
in the length of the line, but also in
the quantity of the syllables. In stead
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:97590:67"/>
of which we use the line of ten sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
recompensing the neglect of
their quantity, with the diligence of
Rime. And this measure is so proper
for an Heroick Poem, as without
some losse of gravity and dignity, it
was never changed. A longer is not
farre from ill prose, and a shorter, is
a kind of whisking (you know) like
the unlacing, rather then the singing
of a Muse. In an Epigramme or a Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
a man may vary his measures, and
seek glory from a needlesse difficulty,
as he that contrived verses into the
forms of an Organ, a Hatchet, an
Egg, an Altar, and a pair of Wings;
but in so great and noble a work
as is an Epick Poeme, for a man
to obstruct his own way with unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
difficulties, is great impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
So likewise to chuse a needlesse
and difficult correspondence of Rime,
is but a difficult toy, and forces a man
sometimes for the stopping of a chink
to say somewhat he did never think;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:97590:67"/>
I cannot therefore but very much
approve your <hi>Stanza,</hi> wherein the
syllables in every verse are ten, and the
Rime, Alternate.</p>
            <p>For the choice of your subject you
have sufficiently justified your self in
your Preface. But because I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in <hi>Virgil,</hi> that the Honour done
to <hi>AEneas</hi> and his companions, has so
bright a reflection upon <hi>Augustus
Cesar,</hi> and other great Romanes of
that time, as a man may suspect
him not constantly possessed with the
noble spirit of those his <hi>Heroes,</hi> and
believe you are not acquainted with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
great man of the Race of <hi>Gondi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert.</hi>
I adde to your Justification the
purity of your purpose, in having no
other motive of your labour, but to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn
virtue, and procure her Lovers;
then which there cannot be a worthier
design &amp; more becoming noble Poesie.</p>
            <p>In that you make so small account
of the example of almost all the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
Poets, antient and moderne,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:97590:68"/>
who thought fit in the beginning, and
sometimes also in the progresse of
their Poemes, to invoke a Muse, or
some other Deitie, that should dictate
to them, or assist them in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
they that take not the laws of
Art, from any reason of their own,
but from the fashion of precedent times,
will perhaps accuse your singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
For my part, I neither subscribe
to their accusation, nor yet condem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
that Heathen custome, otherwise then
as necessary to their false Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For their Poets were their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines;
had the name of <hi>Prophets;</hi>
Exercised amongst the people a kind
of Spirituall Authority; would be
thought to speak by a Divine spirit;
have their works which they writ in
Verse (the Divine stile) passe for the
word of God, and not of man; and to
be harkened to with reverence. Do
not our Divines (excepting the stile)
do the same, and by us that are of the
same Religion cannot justly be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:97590:68"/>
for it? Besides, in the use of
the spirituall calling of Divines, there
is danger sometimes to be feared,
from want of skill, such as is reported
of unskilfull Conjurers, that mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the rites and ceremonious points
of their art, call up such spirits, as they
cannot at their pleasure allay again;
by whom storms are raised, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow
buildings, and are the
cause of miserable wracks at Sea. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull
Divines do oftentimes the like,
For when they call unseasonably for
<hi>Zeal,</hi> there appears a spirit of <hi>Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
and by the like errour instead of
<hi>Truth</hi> they raise <hi>Discord;</hi> instead of
<hi>Wisdome, Fraud;</hi> instead of <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Tumult;</hi> and <hi>Controversie</hi> instead
of <hi>Religion.</hi> Whereas in the Heathen
Poets, at least in those whose works
have lasted to the time we are in,
there are none of those indiscretions
to be found, that tended to subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
or disturbance of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
wherein they lived. But why
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:97590:69"/>
a Christian should think it an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to his Poem, either to profane
the true God, or invoke a false one, I
can imagine no cause, but a reasonlesse
imitation of custome; of a foolish cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome;
by which a man, enabled to
speak wisely from the principles of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and his own meditation, loves ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be thought to speak by inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
like a Bag-pipe.</p>
            <p>Time and education beget expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience;
Experience begets Memory;
Memory begets Judgement and Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
Judgement begets the strength
and structure, and Fancy begets the
ornaments of a Poem. The Antients
therefore fabled not absurdly, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
memory the mother of the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
For memory is the World (though
not really, yet so as in a looking-glass)
in which the Judgement (the severer
Sister) busieth her self in a grave and
rigid examination of all the parts of
Nature, and in registring by Letters,
their order, causes, uses, differences
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:97590:69"/>
and resemblances; Whereby the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
when any work of Art is to be
performed, findeth her materials at
hand and prepared for use, and needs
no more then a swift motion over
them, that what she wants, and is
there to be had, may not lye too long
unespied. So that when she seemeth
to fly from one Indies to the other,
and from Heaven to Earth, and to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate
into the hardest matter, and
obscurest places, into the future, and
into her self, and all this in a point of
time; the voyage is not very great, her
self being all she seeks; and her
wonderfull celerity, consisteth not so
much in motion, as in copious Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery
discreetly ordered, and perfectly
registred in the memory; which most
men under the name of Philosophy
have a glimpse of, and is pretended to
by many that grossely mistaking her
embrace contention in her place. But
so farre forth as the Fancy of man has
traced the wayes of true Philosophy,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:97590:70"/>
so farre it hath produced very marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
effects to the benefit of mankind.
All that is beautifull or defensible in
building; or mervellous in Engines
and Instruments of motion; What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
commodity men receive from
the observation of the Heavens, from
the description of the Earth, from the
account of Time, from walking on
the Seas; and whatsoever distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the civility of <hi>Europe,</hi> from the
Barbarity of the <hi>American</hi> salvages,
is the workmanship of Fancy, but
guided by the Preceps of true Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy.
But where these precepts fail,
as they have hitherto failed in the
doctrine of Morall virtue, there the
Architect (<hi>Fancy)</hi> must take the
Philosophers part upon her self. He
therefore that undertakes an Heroick
Poem (which is to exhibite a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
and amiable Image of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
virtue) must not onely be the
Poet, to place and connex, but also
the Philosopher, to furnish and square
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:97590:70"/>
his matter, that is, to make both body
and soul, colour and shadow of his
Poem out of his own store: which
how well you have performed I am
now considering.</p>
            <p>Observing how few the persons be
you introduce in the beginning, and
how in the course of the actions
of these (the number increasing)
after severall confluences, they run all
at last into the two principall streams
of your Poem, <hi>Gondibert</hi> and <hi>Oswald,</hi>
me thinks the Fable is not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
the Theatre. For so, from severall
and farre distant Sources, do the lesser
Brooks of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> flowing into
one another, fall all at last into the two
main Rivers, the <hi>Po,</hi> and the <hi>Adice.</hi>
It hath the same resemblance also
with a mans veins, which proceeding
from different parts, after the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
insert themselves at last into
the two principall veins of the Body.
But when I considered that also the
actions of men, which singly are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:97590:71"/>
after many conjunctures,
grow at last either into one great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting
power, or into two destroying
Factions; I could not but approve the
structure of your Poem, which ought
to be no other then such as an imitation
of humane life requireth.</p>
            <p>In the streams themselves I find
nothing but setled Valour, clean
Honour, calm Counsel, learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
and pure Love; save onely a
torrent or two of Ambition, which
(though a fault) hath somewhat He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
in it, and therefore must have
place in an Heroick Poem. To shew
the Reader in what place he shall find
every excellent picture of Virtue you
have drawn, is too long. And to shew
him one, is to prejudice the rest; yet I
cannot forbear to point him to the
Description of Love in the person of
<hi>Birtha,</hi> in the seventh <hi>Canto</hi> of the
second Book. There hath nothing
been said of that subject neither by
the Antient nor modern Poets com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:97590:71"/>
to it. Poets are Painters: I
would fain see another Painter draw
so true, perfect, and naturall a Love to
the Life, and make use of nothing but
pure lines, without the help of any
the least uncomely shadow, as you
have done. But let it be read as a piece
by it self, for in the almost equall
heighth of the whole, the eminence of
parts is Lost.</p>
            <p>There are some that are not pleased
with fiction, unlesse it be bold not
onely to exceed the <hi>work,</hi> but also
the <hi>possibility</hi> of nature: they would
have impenetrable Armours, Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Castles, invulnerable bodies, Iron
men, flying Horses, and a thousand
other such things which are easily
feign'd by them that dare. Against
such I defend you (without assenting
to those that condemne either <hi>Homer</hi>
or <hi>Virgil)</hi> by dissenting onely from
those that think the Beauty of a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em
consisteth in the exorbitancy of
the fiction. For as truth is the bound
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:97590:72"/>
of Historicall, so the Resemblance of
truth is the utmost limit of Poeticall
Liberty. In old time amongst the
Heathens, such strange Fictions and
Metamorphoses, were not so remote
from the Articles of their Faith, as
they are now from ours, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are not so unpleasant. Beyond
the actuall works of Nature a Poet
may now go; but beyond the concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
possibility of Nature, never. I can
allow a Geographer to make in the
Sea, a fish or a ship, which by the scale
of his Map would be two or three
hundred miles long, and think it
done for ornament, because it is done
without the precincts of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking;
but when he paints an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
so, I presently apprehend it as
ignorance, and a plain confession of
<hi>Terra incognita.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the description of great Men,
and great Actions is the constant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of a Poet; so the Descriptions
of worthy circumstances are necessary
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:97590:72"/>
accessions to a Poem, and being well
performed, are the Jewels and most
precious ornaments of Poesie. Such
in <hi>Virgil,</hi> are the Funeral games of
<hi>Anchises.</hi> The Duel of <hi>AEneas</hi> and
<hi>Turnus, &amp;c.</hi> And such in yours, are
<hi>The Hunting. The Battel. The City
Mourning. The Funeral<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the House of
Astragon. The Library. And the
Temples.</hi> Equal to his, or those of
<hi>Homer</hi> whom he imitated.</p>
            <p>There remains now no more to be
considered but the Expression, in
which consisteth the countenance
and colour of a beautifull Muse; and
is given her by the Poet out of his
own provision, or is borrowed from
others. That which he hath of his
own, is nothing but experience and
knowledge of Nature, and specially
humane Nature; and is th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> true and
naturall Colour. But that which is
taken out of Books (the ordinary
boxes of counterfeit Complexion)
shews well or ill, as it hath more or
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:97590:73"/>
lesse resemblance with the Naturall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and are not to be used (without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination)
unadvisedly. For in him
that professes the imitation of Nature,
(as all Poets do) what greater fault can
there be, then to bewray an ignorance
of nature in his Poem; especially ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a liberty allowed him, if he meet
with any thing he cannot master, to
leave it out?</p>
            <p>That which giveth a Poem the
true and naturall Colour, consisteth in
two things, which are, <hi>To know well;</hi>
that is, to have images of nature in the
memory distinct and clear; and <hi>To
know much.</hi> A sign of the first is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuity,
property, and decency;
which delight all sorts of men, either
by instructing the ignorant, or sooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the learned in their knowledge:
A sign of the later is novelty of expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and pleaseth by excitation of the
mind; for novelty causeth a dmiration;
and admiration, curiosity; which is a
delightfull appetite of knowledge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:97590:73"/>
There be so many words in use at
this day in the English tongue, that,
though of magnifick sound, yet (like
the windy blisters of a troubled water)
have no sense at all; and so many
others that lose their meaning by
being ill coupled, that it is a hard
matter to avoid them; for having
been obtruded upon Youth in the
Schools (by such as make it, I think,
their businesse there, as 'tis exprest by
the best Poet)
<q>
                  <l>With terms to charm the weak and
pose the wise.</l>
                  <bibl>Gondib. 1 r. Cant. 5.</bibl>
               </q>
they grow up with them, and gaining
reputation with the ignorant, are not
easily shaken off.</p>
            <p>To this palpable darknesse, I may
also add the ambitious obscurity of
expressing more then is perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
or perfect conception in fewer
words then it requires. Which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
though they have had the
honour to be called strong lines, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
no better then Riddles, and not
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:97590:74"/>
onely to the Reader, but also (after a
little time) to the Writer himself, dark
and troublesome.</p>
            <p>To the property of Expression, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
that clearnesse of memory, by
which a Poet when he hath once intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
any person whatsoever, speaking
in his Poem, maintaineth in him, to
the end, the same Character he gave
to him in the beginning. The varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof, is a change of pace that
argues the Poet tired.</p>
            <p>Of the Indecencies of an Heroick
Poem, the most remarkable are
those that shew disproportion either
between the persons and their actions,
or between the manners of the Poet
and the Poem. Of the first kind, is
the uncomelinesse of representing in
great persons the inhumane vice of
Cruelty, or the sordid vices of Lust
and Drunkennesse. To such parts as
those, the Antient approved Poets
thought it fit to suborn, not the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of men, but of monsters and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:97590:74"/>
beastly Giants, such as <hi>Polyphemus,
Cacus,</hi> and the <hi>Centaurs.</hi> For it is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
a Muse, when she is invoked to
sing a song of that nature, should
maidenly advise the Poet to set such
persons to sing their own vices upon
the stage; for it is not so unseemly in
a Tragedy. Of the same kind it is to
represent scurrility, or any action or
language that moveth much laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The delight of an Epique Poem
consisteth not in mirth but in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Mirth and laughter is proper to
Comedy and Satyre. Great persons
that have their minds employed on
great designs have not leisure
enough to laugh, and are pleased
with the contemplation of their own
power and virtues, so as they need
not the infirmities and vices of other
men to recommend themselves to
their own favour by comparison, as
all men do when they laugh. Of the
second kind, where the disproportion
is between the Poet, and the persons
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:97590:75"/>
of his Poem, one is in the Dialect of
the Inferiour sort of People which is
alwayes different from the language
of the Court. Another is to derive the
Illustration of any thing, from such
metaphors or comparisons as cannot
come into mens thoughts, but by mean
conversation, and experience of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or evil Arts, which the persons of
an Epick Poem cannot be thought ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Knowing much,</hi> proceedeth
the admirable variety and novelty of
metaphors and similitudes, which are
not possibly to be lighted on in the
compasse of a narrow knowledge.
And the want whereof compelleth a
Writer to Expressions that are either
defac'd by time, or sullied with vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
or long use. For the phrases of
Poesie, as the airs of Musick, with
often hearing become insipide; the
Reader having no more sense of their
force, then our Flesh is sensible of the
bones that sustain it. As the sense we
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:97590:75"/>
have of bodies, consisteth in change
and variety of impression, so also do's
the sense of language in the variety
and changeable use of words. I mean
not in the affectation of words newly
brought home from travel, but in new
(and withall, significant) translation
to our purposes, of those that be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
received, and in farre fetch't (but
withall, apt, instructive, and comely)
sumilitudes.</p>
            <p>Having thus (I hope) avoided the
first Exception, against the Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency
of my Judgement: I am but
little moved with the second; which
is, of being bribed by the honour you
have done me, by attributing in your
Preface somewhat to my Judgement.
For I have used your Judgement no
losse in many things of mine, which
coming to light will thereby appear
the better. And so you have your
bribe again.</p>
            <p>Having thus made way for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of my Testimony, I give it
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:97590:76"/>
briefly thus; I never yet saw Poem
that had so much shape of Art,
health of Morality, and vigour
and beauty of Expression, as this of
yours. And but for the clamour of
the multitude that hide their Envy
of the present, under a Reverence of
Antiquity, I should say further, that it
would last as long as either the <hi>AEneid</hi>
or <hi>Iliad,</hi> but for one Disadvantage.
And the Disadvantage is this: The
languages of the Greeks and Romans
(by their Colonies and Conquest)
have put off flesh and bloud, and are
become immutable, which none of the
Modern Tongues are like to be. I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
Antiquity; but, that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called <hi>old time,</hi> is <hi>young time.</hi>
The glory of Antiquity is due, not to
the Dead, but to the Aged.</p>
            <p>And now, whilst I think on't,
give me leave with a short discord to
sweeten the Harmony of the approch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
close. I have nothing to object
against your Poem; but, dissent onely
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:97590:76"/>
from something in your Preface,
sounding to the prejudice of Age. 'Tis
commonly said, that old Age is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to Child-hood. Which me
thinks you insist on so long, as if you
desired it should be beleeved. That's
the Note I mean to shake a little. That
saying, meant onely of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of body, was wrested to the
weaknesse of mind, by froward chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
weary of the controlment of
their parents, masters, and other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitours.
Secondly, the dotage and
childishnesse they ascribe to Age, is
never the effect of Time, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of the excesses of Youth, and
not a returning to, but a continuall
stay with Child-hood. For they that
wanting the curiosity of furnishing
their memories with the rarities of
nature in their Youth, and passe their
time in making provision onely for
their ease and sensuall delight, are
Children still, at what years soever; as
they that coming into a populous
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:97590:77"/>
city, never go out of their own
Inne, are strangers still, how long
soever they have been there. Thirdly,
there is no reason for any man to
think himself wiser to day then ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterday,
which doth not equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
he shall be wiser to morrow then
to day.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, you will be forced to
change your opinion hereafter when
you are old; and in the mean time you
discredit all I have said before in your
commendation, because I am old al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.
But no more of this.</p>
            <p>I believe (Sir) you have seen a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
kind of perspective, where, he
that looks through a short hollow
pipe, upon a picture conteining di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
figures, sees none of those that
are there painted, but some one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
made up of their parts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed
to the eye by the artificiall
cutting of a glasse. I find in my ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
an effect not unlike it from
your Poem. The virtues you distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:97590:77"/>
there amongst so many noble
Persons represent (in the reading)
the image but of one mans virtue to
my fancy, which is your own; and
that so deeply imprinted, as to stay
for ever there, and govern all the rest of
my thoughts and affections in the way
of honouring and serving you, to the
utmost of my power, that am</p>
