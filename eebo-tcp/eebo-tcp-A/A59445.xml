            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:61842:2"/>I have added little to the Story, onely have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented that in Action, which was expressed by him in long Narrations: For we find (though the French do often relate the most considerable Actions in their Plays, especially in their Tragedies) the English will not be content without seeing such Actions done, and this is one, of those many things, that make our English Plays so much exceed the French: But this was long ago ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by <hi>Horace:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Segnius irritant animos demissa per aurem,</l>
                  <l>Quam quae sunt oculis subjecta sidelibus.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I have endeavour'd to carry on these few Humors, which were but begun by him; and (to satisfie the Concupiscence as Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> calls it, of Jigge and Song) I designed as fit occasions for them as I could, there being in the former Play but one short Song which is the last but one.</p>
            <p>Where it is possible, I have kept the Scenes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken, and with as proper a connexion as I could. What I have besides added I need not tell you, being I fear so much worse that his, that you will easily distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish it.</p>
            <p>I shall say little more of the Play, but that the Rules of Morality and good Manners are strictly observed in it: (Vertue being exalted, and Vice depressed) and perhaps it might have been better received had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther been done in it: for I find, it pleases most to see
<pb facs="tcp:61842:2"/>
Vice incouraged by bringing the Characters of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd people upon the Stage, and making them pass for fine Gentlemen who openly profess Swearing, Drinking, Whoring, breaking Windows, beating Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that is esteem'd among us a Gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ile gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Humour, which is contrary to the Customs and Laws of all civilized Nations. But it is said, by some, that this pleases the people, and a Poets business is onely to endeavour that: But he that debases himself to think of nothing but pleasing the Rabble, loses the dignity of a Poet, and becomes as little as a Jugler, or a Rope-Dancer; who please more then he can do: but the office of a Poet is,
<q>
                  <l>Simul &amp; jucunda, &amp; idonea dicere vitae.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Which (if the Poets of our age would observe it) would render 'em as usefull to a Commonwealth as any profession whatsoever.</p>
            <p>But I have too long troubled you with a Discourse of this Play, which (let me say what I will of it) you will judge of as you please: But if you consider, aft<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
