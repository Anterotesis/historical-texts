            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

such apparant tokens of Gods wrath, able
to fright vgly sinne, from the hearts of welshaped
creation, and make men by Contrition as pure,
as before they were polluted with their fleshly
Concupiscence.</p>
            <p>IN the City of <hi>Namen,</hi> in the Lowe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
there dwelt a poore labouring man,
hauing to his wife a woman of a good birth, and
reputed alwayes vertuous in her liuing. This
poore woman had a sister excéeding rich, one as
fully vicious, as she was vertuous, more proud,
then she could be humble. So blind is Fortune
in her gifts, that merit doth not guide her, but
Chaunce.</p>
            <p>The poore mans wife being great with child,
and feeling the pangs of Childbirth, in all haste
sent her husband to her rich sister, to lend her
ayde in that extremity, thinking that womanly
Charity (if they had not bene sisters) would haue
made her come and visited her in that time of
neede and danger.</p>
            <p>The poore man béeing come to his wines
sisters house, and speaking with her, told her
the cause of his comming. But she replyed, and
sayd, How darest thou (base begger) to come to
procure me to visit so poore a whore, whose blood
and knowledge I disclayme, as being not my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
right begotten daughter, but a bastard? I
<pb facs="tcp:6056:4"/>
haue friendes comming to my house, to make
marry with me, and I shall leaue them, and goe
helpe to bring more beggers into the world.</p>
            <p>The poore man replyed, O sister, do not so
much wrong your poore sister, as to terme her
a bastard, being your mothers daughter.</p>
            <p>With that, this inraged shée-deuill strooke
the poore man with a staffe, that the blood ranne
about his eares, and commaunded her seruants
to kicke him out of doores, saying. It was a fit
reward for a begger, that will call a Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
sister.</p>
            <p>Home goes this poore man, with a sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
heart, calling to Almighty God for venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
on this Monster of her sexe, that pittilesse
woman: And comming to his wife, told her of
the vnkindnesse of her sister. The poore affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
woman, through griefe and rage, fell present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in labour, and was deliuered of thrée Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
striking a terrour to those women imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in that businesse.</p>

               </gap>se ill-proportioned children, were a sonne
and two daughters; and the first that sawe this
world, was a daughter, that had such dressings,
and attyre on the head, by nature of flesh, as wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
haue made by art of Bonelaces, and such
like, with a fleshy Uardingale about the middle
of it, as if Nature, hauing forsaken her old fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb facs="tcp:6056:4"/>
had now deuised new.</p>
            <p>This child, (or rather Monster) cryed with a
shrill voyce, and spake, saying, O thou Creator,
that gauest me this forme &amp; life, let me not liue
here in this world of Pride, of Lust, of Murther,
and all wickednesse: returne me suddenly to
what I was; for here (I know) is nothing but
calamity. And as it spake these words, it straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
dyed.</p>
            <p>The second was a sonne, with a strange mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shapen
head, hauing vpon the backe of his right
hand, the fashion of a deaths head: And this child
sayd, that Dearth and Plague should couer the
whole World, and that they were sent to giue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it to all men. And so speach and life left
him together.</p>
            <p>The third was a daughter, hauing about the
necke, a Ruffe laced, and Cuffes about the
wrests, like the Ruffe, all of flesh, so artificiall in
nature, as if Nature in her first work had intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Arte to help her: And this child sayd, that
God would punish the world suddenly, for our
manifold transgressions; and sayd moreouer,
that they thrée were sent to forewarne vs of the
Lords comming; and then straight dyed</p>
            <p>The mother of these Monsters, through griefe
and terror, yelded vp the ghost, and left a poore
disconsolate husband behind her, to fill y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth
<pb facs="tcp:6056:5"/>
of rumor, with these strange vnheard of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
            <p>But now to shew the Iustice of God, with his
mercyes.</p>
            <p>That proud, rich, vnnaturall sister of this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
mother, at the same instant time that
this poore woman was deliuered, had her house,
amidst all her mirth, fired with lightening: and
shée flying out of it, to saue her life, the willing
earth gaped wyde, and swallowed her quick, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it more fit for her to be in the earth, then on
the earth, being so vnnaturall against nature:
And her wealth and all her substance was quite
consumed with that quenchlesse fire, till Gods
Iudgement was executed, and then it ceast of it
selfe, doing no farther damage.</p>
            <p>The fame of these wonders hauing possest the
City, and the trueth of them apparantly knowne,
stirred vp good motions in the hearts of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
to Fasting, to Prayer, to Almes-déeds,
and such like workes of grace and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
            <p>The Gouernours of the City caused it to be
printed, as well to giue the country round about
knowledge of it, as to continue the remembrance
of it there, that they might still preseuer in the
good course they begun.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I set downe briefly these wonders
<pb facs="tcp:6056:5"/>
in nature, in the City of <hi>Namen</hi> in Flanders,
which happned the 16 of December last.
