            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> than any of the other white Mulbery trees, bearing either the white, or the red berry. Wherefore if it bee poſſible, furniſh your ground onely of this kinde, that the food of the Silk-worme, and ſo withall, your ſilke may be the more exquiſite.</p>
            <p>Next to this, is the white Mulbery tree, bearing the white berry, which ſome (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as there are diuers fancies) holds to be the better: neuertheleſſe the former is generally held the beſt.</p>
            <p>Aboue all,<note place="margin">A Rule.</note> keepe no tree in your Mulbery yard, which beares leaues very much indented; for it is neither of ſo great ſubſtance, nor yeelds ſo much food as that which hath leſſe nickes: but yet this tree will be made good by graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon it.</p>
            <p>Hauing choſen your beſt plant of the white Mulbery tree bearing blacke berries,<note place="margin">Soyle of the Mulbery, for good leafe.</note> the next choiſe to be made, is of fitte ground to plant them in. Secondly, to haue wholeſome and profitable foode for your Wormes, you muſt plant them in ſuch a ſoile as is beſt fitting for your Vine, namely, not in too fat a ground, nor yet in too barren and leane, but in a middling ſoile: rather in a drie than a moiſt, in a light than a heauy, in a grauelly than a clay. For the quantity of the leaues, true it is, the farre and rich ground is the beſt, but not for the quality; for the leaner ground breed the leafe, of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10704:5"/>
moſt profitable and perfect nouriſhment: the Mulbery tree hauing that in common with the Vine, which brings the beſt Wine in the like ſoile to this; ſo then the lighter ground brings forth the more exquiſite, delicate, and ſauoury leafe for the foode of the Silke-worme, and the fat ground a more ranke, groſſe, flaſh, and vnſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uory leafe, which being an vnwholeſome kind, ſeldome fadges well with the Worme or neuer, vnleſſe it be helped by an excellent good ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: whereas the leafe of the leaner and mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſoyle, neuer fayles the effecting of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired purpoſe. The leafe of the Mulbery will be then well qualified as is fitting, if you plant them in an indifferent ſoyle, ſomewhat dry, far from ſprings of water, and from bogges, and from watry and foggy places;<note place="margin">What ſoyle beſt.</note> prouided alſo, that they be expoſed to the Sunne, and kept as much as may be from the annoyance of the North and Eaſt Windes: for with the Vine too, the Mulbery hates a cold, ſhady, and watry ſituation. And though the Vine and the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery bring forth more in a fat ſtrong ground then in a leaner, yet ſo it is, that the little of the fruite of the leaner ground being delicate, is more eſteemed and of better price, than the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of that out of the fatter ſoyle, which is coorſe and groſſe.</p>
            <p>The third thing, is to ſhew the beſt time and order to plant and remooue the Mulbery tree, and at what age the leafe is good. Conſidering
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:10704:5"/>
there be ſuch ſtore of growne Mulbery trees, ſmall and great in <hi>Virginia</hi> to be taken vp, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall be ſaid now of planting the ſuckers or branches, nor yet of ſowing the Mulbery ſeede (which though it be the ſloweſt, yet it is held a ſure and a good way) but we will onely aduiſe you to take choyce of ſuch well-growne Mulberies, as may ſooneſt bring profit by their forward flouriſhing. Experience teaches,<note place="margin">The leafe of the old Mulbery, the beſt.</note> that the leaues of the olde Mulbery trees are farre more healthfull for the Worme, and more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable than thoſe of the young ones, in caſe they be ſtill vigorous and not falne into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme decay through age: the Mulbery tree, as in many things, being in this alſo like to the Vine, which brings better wine olde than young. And as the Vine begins to beare good Wine after the ſeuen or eyght firſt yeeres of his planting, ſo likewiſe the Mulbery tree in the ſame age, brings forth ſo good leafage, wherof you may be ſure to reape certaine profit.</p>
            <p>The time and manner of remoouing of the Mulbery tree, is much after the faſhion of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: you may remooue and plant the Mulbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in September, October, Nouember, Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, February, March, or Aprill, and in Ianuary too if it be not froſty weather.<note place="margin">When to remoue the Mulbery tree.</note> Take them vp in faire weather, being neither froſty nor hotte, with ſuch care and curiouſneſſe that you may haue all the rootes whole and intire, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny being broken or bruiſed if it bee poſſible:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10704:6"/>
which to doe, you muſt neither ſpare coſt, nor paines, nor muſt you want patience, which is neceſſary for this action, for feare leſt through rude haſtineſſe and careleſneſſe, your trees ill taken vp, prooue loſt charge and labour. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you take them vp, head them, cutting off all their branches, leauing ſome forked armes of them onely with ſnags, of ſuch length as is fitting for new growth, as vſually is done in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing of other trees.<note place="margin">How to remoue Mulbery trees, and to prepare the ground for t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>em.</note> To doe well, three moneths at leaſt before you remoue them, you muſt make holes in the earth ready digged for them, where you minde to ſet them. The lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the holes are digged before you ſet them, be it a whole yeere, ſo much the better; for the more the earth is ſeaſoned and prepared by the weather, the eaſier the trees take rooting, and draw the better nouriſhment from the earth. But if neceſſity conſtraine you to dig the holes at the ſame inſtant that you are to plant them, then muſt you burne ſome ſmall wood, buſhes, or ſtraw in the holes, that the fire may ſupply the want of the Sunne and the froſt, for the fit preparing of the earth: if otherwiſe, you muſt not fill vp the holes with that earth which was taken out of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but with other ſeaſoned earth, pared and taken onely from the very top of the ground, which is better ſeaſoned by the Sunne than that raw earth which lyeth deeper. The holes muſt bee made very large and wide for them, for to containe the roots at full eaſe; you

may be ſure you cannot make them too big. The rootes muſt be ſet as deepe in the ground, as they were then when they were taken vp; ſo ſhall you plant them after their naturall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which is beſt, neither too deepe, not too ſhallow. There muſt be left halfe a foot of ſmall looſe earth in the bottome of the hole, to ſet the roots vpon; which earth, if it bee not well prepared before by the weather, muſt bee taken from the top of the ground, and by this means, they will the eaſier and ſooner take root down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The roots muſt be ſet downe eaſily, and put into the earth as neere as may bee, to the ſame ſite and naturall poſture that they were when they were growing, taking heed that in placing them, you make not the roots to preſſe and croſſe one vpon another: wherefore ſee that you couer the roots well, and handſomly, putting betweene them all ſoft and fine earth, preſſing it downe, and couering them by little and little patiently with the hand, and not treading them with the feet, or vſing rammers, and beaters, as ſome doe, which ſpoyleth them, but filling them vp rather, and kneading the earth about them gently with the hand, as is ſaid; beginning firſt from the loweſt roots, and ſo going on to the middlemoſt, and then at laſt to the higheſt, till the ground be leuelled. So ſhall all the roots be couered, without any hollowneſſe being left betweene them; for this cloſeneſſe keepes the roots from taking wind,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:10704:7"/>
and from water ſtanding about them, which rots them. If in the negligent taking vp, part of the roots be vnbarked, bruiſed, or broken, that part muſt be cut off before you plant it, and you muſt put earth cloſe about that place which is thus hurt, that water and ayre come not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene it and the earth, to rot it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">For Mulbery trees to ſpread and grow bigger.</note>To haue your Mulbery trees grow big, and faire ſpred, you muſt ſhred off ſome two inches of the tops of all the branches round about, and eſpecially to cut the maſter bough of the ſtocke, in lopping the top of the tree, ſo as in the whole height of the growth, the tree bee not aboue ſixe, or ſeuen foot high from the ground: for keeping your trees alwayes at that height by ſhredding them, they will ſpread the more: for the ſubſtance going backe, will be imployed in nouriſhing of the ſtocke; whereas if you let the branches grow at will, there will be much ranke and vnprofitable wood.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">In what ſpace to plant the Mulbery tree.</note>The fourth poynt requiſite for the goodneſſe of the Mulbery leafe, is, the regard to be had in the planting of them in fit diſtance and ſpace one from another, whereby the Sunne may come euery way freely to them, to giue you a well-concocted and wholſome fine leafe for your Silkworms. The more ſpace of ground the Mulbery tree hath freely by himſelfe, and the more frankly the ayre and Sunne comes to it, the greater it growes, and brings the better leaues. Therefore if you will make, as it were,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10704:7"/>
whole Forreſts and Woods of the Mulbery trees, you muſt plant them in a ſtraight line, and comely figure of a quincunx, euery tree being diſtant one from another euery way, at leaſt foure and twenty or thirty foot. Or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, hauing ſuch ſtore of Mulbery trees as you haue ſomewhere in <hi>Virginia,</hi> you may take vp all trees betweene them, that hinder this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from thirty foot, to thirty foot, that the Sunne may come throughly to them.</p>
            <p>But if you will plant them in rankes in the hedges, and out-borders of your plough-lands, or other grounds, then may you plant them neerer together, yet alwayes without preſſing them too neere one another; for that is euer to the hurt of the tree, and the loſſe of the owner. But conſidering that the onely out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skirts of arable lands, vineyards, and other parts of your demeane lands, though indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently large, are not ſufficient to containe Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery trees in ſo great a number, as is fitting to feed the Wormes in abundance; and for that on the other ſide, the leaues of the trees which are in the thickets and woods, are not ſo good and wholſome for them, as thoſe that are ſet in due ſpace in the out-borders, becauſe the other neither haue Sun, nor winde at will: a meane betweene theſe two extremes is found, conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently to plant the Mulbery trees for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of good leafage, and yet without much hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the tillage and vſe of good land. And
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10704:8"/>
this is to plant the trees amidſt your grounds by line and leuell in double rowes, one ſingle rowe being euen diſtant from the other ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene foot, and ſo likewiſe euery tree to be ſet in the ſame diſtance from one another; which being thus planted, the two rowes on each ſide make one faire alley.<note place="margin">The beſt way to plant Mulbery trees in good order: like to the firſt of More field walkes.</note> And you muſt diſpoſe theſe allies on this manner; namely, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, and acroſſe the field, the one alley thwart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and intercroſſing the other, leauing on the outſides on them great empty ſquares of ground, euery ſquare containing an acre, or more, as a man pleaſeth, for to ſow corne there, which may bee reaped, without being trod downe by the gatherers of the leaues; for when they gather the leaues, they ſhall tread only on the allies, or neere them; which allies taking vp but ſmall roome, there will be but little loſſe of ground, either for your come, or for other vſes. You muſt alſo plant the trees in theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in ſuch ſort, that they be not ſet iuſt right ouer one againſt another, leſt they be peſtered together, but ſet a tree of one row, ſtill againſt the empty ſpace of the other row: ſo ſhall they haue roome and aire enough to grow luſtily and freſhly, hauing thus the benefit of the Sun, which will alwayes come moſt freely vpon them, eſpecially vpon the open ſides of the great ſquares. In which ſquares you may, if you will, conueniently ſow corne, ſpecially O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es, and field Peaſe, or ſuch like; which though they be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10704:8"/>
trodden downe in the gathering of the leaues, yet can they haue no great hurt, by reaſon that the blades of theſe graines will bee then back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and they will riſe againe, though they be beaten down to the ground; ſo wil not Wheat, Rye, nor Barly, which for that reaſon would not be ſowne in your Mulbery-yard, but vpon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</p>
            <p>There is another commodity comes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of ploughing your Mulbery grounds: for the Mulbery tree proſpers much better in the looſe ploughed or digged ground, then in the hard cloddy medowes and paſtures, ſo as you take heed leſt in ploughing or digging about them, you hurt not the rootes. In the ſame ſquares you may alſo plant Vines, where they will profit, as being not much hindered by the ſhade of the trees; or you may, if you had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, haue medowes or paſtures in them, after the trees haue had foure or fiue yeeres rooting, ſo as you dig the earth looſe about the roots, and ſometimes dung them. In this ſort, without hindering your demeanes better, than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, neere to your houſe (for ſo is moſt fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) may you plant your Mulbery yards with great profit, both for the goodnes of the leaf, &amp; for the pleaſure and beauty which will be in the walkes, in which alſo if you pleaſe, you may ſow, or ſet ſomewhat, that may bee for vſe and profit, and quit the coſt of labouring the ground.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:10704:9"/>Now you muſt not content your ſelfe in planting a few; for the Mulbery trees being the maine foundation of this reuenue, that muſt be the chiefeſt thing whereat you muſt aime, for to plant ſo great a quantity of them, and ſo ſoone, that in a ſhort time you may reape the ſweetneſſe of this rich profit to your contentment.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that are perfectly experienced in this buſineſſe, aduiſe a man by all meanes to haue as great abundance of Mulbery trees as is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and for one that is a good husband to reape good profit, they preſcribe the quantity of two or three thouſand trees;<note place="margin">One man ſhould haue two or three thouſand Mulbery trees in hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Therefore it is neceſſary to imploy this worke heere in a great volume, or elſe the play will hardly be worth the candle. It is onely for women wantonly to keepe a few Silk-wormes, with a few Mulbery trees, more for pleaſure, than for profit. So then, if you minde to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rich indeed in this commodity, you muſt not ſtay at that number of trees aboue-named, but alwayes ſtill augment your Mulbery yard, adding thereto certaine hundreds of trees yeerly, both for feeding plenty of Wormes, and alſo for the ſuccour of the trees, whereof
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:10704:9"/>
you ſhall doe well to let ſome part of them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery yeere reſt vnleaued; as Lands that bee fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, to haue them in better hart. Now the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit riſing by the leaues, is thus eſtimated:<note place="margin">A thouſand waight of leaues feed an ounce of ſeed.</note> A thouſand waight of Mulbery leaues, is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to feed an ounce of ſeed in Silk-wormes: and an ounce of ſeed, if the race in goodnes, the conuenience of the lodging, the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the leafe, and the ſeaſonable time for the worke of the Silkwormes, and the carefull diligence of the Gouernour, all agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (for there muſt be a conſort of all theſe) then (I ſay) an ounce of good ſeed, makes eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fiue or ſixe pound of ſilke, which what it is worth euery one knowes. And this thouſand waight of leaues, ſome twenty, or fiue &amp; twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty trees of a meane ſize, will alwayes bring forth. Yea a much leſſe number of trees ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth for ſo much waight, if they bee old and great.

The coſt and charge of the buſineſſe yeerly, is thus rated in France, a fourth of the totall defrayes it all, and ſo there remaines three parts of cleere reuenue to the owner.</p>
            <p>Beſides this profit of ſilke to be made of the Mulbery tree, which is of infinite commodity alone; it is alſo good for many other ſingular vſes. By tryall made, it hath been found, that

the barke of the white Mulbery tree makes good linnen cloth,<note place="margin">Other profits of the Mulbery tree</note> and Cordage. The wood alſo is good to make hoopes for tubs and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and it is fit for all Ioyners worke, and for any vſe that is yeelding and pliant: it is alſo good about ſhips and botes: the boughs ſhred off, are excellent for Conies: the berries are much deſired of poultry, and is good feed for them; and the leaues, all that fall of themſelues to the ground in the end of Summer, being laid by in ſome place, and taken thence day by day, as you need, and giuen boyled to ſwine, keepe them in good ſtate, and begin to put them into fleſh. Theſe, and diuers other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities come of this excellent tree; which aboue all others therefore, you muſt preſerue and multiply ſtill in <hi>Virginia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this aboueſaid ſhall be added and taught the way how to make Silk-wormes, which is reported by ſome, the experiment whereof is ſo much the more neceſſary to bee tryed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is great danger in carrying of the Silk-wormes ſeed, ſo long a iourney by Sea to <hi>Virginia.</hi>
