            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

The humble Petition of his Excellency Thomas Lord Fairfax,

People, by them framed and prepared.</head>
            <p>IN our late Remonſtrance of the 18 of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember
laſt, we propounded (next after
the matters of publike Juſtice) ſome
Foundations for a general ſettlement of Peace
in the Nation, which we therein deſired
might be formed and Eſtabliſhed in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a generall Contract or Agreement of
the People; and ſince then, the matters ſo
propounded be wholly rejected, or no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of them admitted in Parliament
(though viſibly of higheſt Moment to the
Publique) and all ordinary Remedies being
denyed, we were neceſſitated to an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
way of Remedy; whereby to avoyd
the miſchiefs then at hand, and ſet you in a
condition (without ſuch obſtructions or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions
by corrupt Members) to proceed to
matters of publique Juſtice and general Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Now as nothing did in our own
hearts more juſtifie our late undertakings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
many Members in this Parliament,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101490:3"/>
then the neceſſity thereof in order to a ſound
Settlement in the Kingdom, and the integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of our intentions to make uſe of it only to
that end: ſo we hold our ſelves obliged to
give the People all aſſurance poſſible, That
our oppoſing the corrupt cloſure endeavoured
with the King, was not in deſigne to hinder
Peace or Settlement, (thereby to render our
employments, as Souldiers, neceſſary to
be continued,) and that neither that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
courſe we have taken, nor any other
proceedings of ours, have been intended for
the ſetting up of any particular Party or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
by or with which to uphold our ſelves
in Power and Dominion over the Nation,
but that it was and is the deſire of our hearts,
in all we have done, (with the hindering of
that imminent evil, and deſtructive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with the King) to make way for the
ſettlement of a Peace and Government of the
Kingdom upon Grounds of common Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Safety: And therefore becauſe ou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
former Overtures for that purpoſe (being
only in general terms, and not reduced to a
certainty of particulars fit for practiſe) might
poſſibly be underſtood but as plauſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
not intended really to be be put into
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101490:3"/>
effect, We have thought it our duty to draw
out theſe generals into an intire frame of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
aſcertained with ſuch circumſtances
as may make it effectively practicable. And
for that end, while your time hath been taken
up in other matters of high and preſent Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
we have ſpent much of ours in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
and perfecting ſuch a draught of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
and in all things ſo circumſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
as to render it ripe for your ſpeedier con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
and the Kingdoms acceptance and
practiſe (if approved,) and ſo we do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
humbly preſent it to you. Now to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
miſ-underſtanding of our intentions
therein, We have but this to ſay, That we are
far from ſuch a Spirit, as poſitively to impoſe
our private apprehenſions upon the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of any in the Kingdom, that have not
forfeited their Freedom, and much leſſe upon
your ſelves: Neither are we apt in any wiſe
to inſiſt upon circumſtantial things, or ought
that is not evidently fundamental to that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Intereſt for which You and We have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
and engaged; But in this Tender of it
we humbly deſire,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1. That whether it ſhall be fully approved by You and
received by the People (as it now ſtands) or not,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101490:4"/>
it may yet remain upon Record, before you, a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
witneſs of our real intentions and utmost en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors
for a ſound and equal Settlement, and as
a testimony whereby all men may be aſſured, what
we are willing and ready to <hi>acquieſce</hi> in; and their
jealouſies ſatisfied or mouths ſtopt, who are apt to
think or ſay, we have no bottom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2. That (with all expedition which the immediate and
preſsing great affairs will admit) it may receive
your moſt mature Conſideration and Reſolutions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, not that we deſire either the whole, or what you
ſhall like in it, ſhould be by your Authority impoſed
as a Law upon the Kingdom, (for ſo it would loſe
the intended nature of <hi>An Agreement of the
People,)</hi> but that (ſo far as it concurs with your
own judgments) it may receive Your Seal of Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
only.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>3. That (according to the method propounded therein)
it may be tendred to the People in all parts, to be
ſubſcribed by thoſe that are willing, (as Petitions,
and other things of a voluntary nature, are;) and
that meanwhile, the aſcertaining of thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
which it refers to Commiſsioners in the
ſeveral Counties, may be proceeded upon in a way
preparatory to the practiſe of it: And if upon the
Account of ſubſcriptions (to be returned by thoſe
Commiſsioners in <hi>April</hi> next) there appear to be
a general or common Reception of it amongst the
People, or by the well affected of them, and ſuch as
are not obnoxious for Delinquency: it may then
take place, and effect according to the Tenor and
Subſtance of it. And Your Petitioners ſhall pray, &amp;c.</hi>

and recommended, as the publike Profeſſion in this
Nation (which wee deſire may by the grace of God
be reformed to the greateſt purity in Doctrine, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and Diſcipline, according to the Word of God.)
The inſtructing of the People whereunto in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
way (ſo it be not compulſive) as alſo the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of able Teachers for that end, and for the
confutation or diſcovery of Hereſie, Errour, and
whatſoever is contrary to ſound Doctrine, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to be provided for by our Repreſentatives;
the maintenance of which Teachers may be out of a
publike Treaſury, and wee deſire not by tithes.
Provided, That Popery or Prelacy be not held forth as
the publike way or profeſſion in this Nation.</item>
                  <item>2. That to the publique Profeſſion ſo held forth none be
compelled by penalties or otherwiſe; but onely may
be endeavoured to be wonne by ſound Doctrine, and
the Example of a good Converſation.</item>
                  <item>3. That ſuch as profeſſe Faith in God by Jeſus Chriſt
(however differing in judgement from the Doctrine,
Worſhip or Diſcipline publikely held forth, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid)
ſhall not be reſtrained from, but ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
in the profeſſion of their Faith and exerciſe of
Religion according to their Conſciences in any
place (except ſuch as ſhall be ſet apart for the publick
Worſhip, where wee provide not for them, unleſſe
they have leave) ſo as they abuſe not this liberty to
the civil injury of others, or to actuall diſturbance of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101490:14"/>
the publique peace on their parts; nevertheleſſe it
is not intended to bee hereby provided, That this
liberty ſhall neceſſarily extend to Popery or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy.</item>
                  <item>4. That all Lawes, Ordinances, Statutes, and clauſes in
any Law, Statute, or Ordinance to the contrary of the
liberty provided for in the two particulars next pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
concerning Religion be and are hereby repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and made void.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>10. It is agreed, That whoſoever ſhall by Force of

render up, or give, or take away the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of common Right, Liberty and Safety contain'd
in this Agreement) ſhall forthwith after his or their ſuch
Reſiſtance loſe the benefit and protection of the Laws, and
ſhall be puniſhable with Death, as an Enemy and Traitour
to the Nation.</p>
            <p>The form of ſubſcription for the Officers of the Army.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of the things exprest in this Agreement, The certain ending of
this Parliament (as in the firſt Article) The equall or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable

of Repreſentatives ſo elected (which are provided for in the
third Article) as alſo the Qualifications of Perſons to elect or

Article) Alſo the certainty of a number for paſſing a Law or
preparatory debates (provided for in the fourth Article) The

both agree thereunto, and reſolve to maintain the ſame, as
God ſhall enable us. The reſt of the matters in this Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
wee account to be uſefull and good for the Publike,
and the particular circumſtances of Numbers, Times and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
expreſſed in the ſeverall Articles, we account not Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall,
but we finde them neceſſary to be here determined for

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING ever ſince the end of the firſt War
longingly waited for ſome ſuch ſettlement
of the Peace and Government of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whereby the Common Rights, Liberties
and ſafety thereof, might in future be more
hopefully provided for, and therein ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
gained, which might be accounted to the preſent age
and poſterity (through the mercy of God) as a fruit of their
labours, hazards and ſufferings, that have engaged in the
common cauſe, as ſome price of the bloud ſpilt, and bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
to the publique expence and damage ſuſtained in the
War, and as ſome due improvement of that ſucceſſe, and
bleſſing God hath pleaſed to give therein: And having not
found any ſuch Eſtabliſhment aſſayed or endeavoured by
thoſe whoſe proper worke it was, but the many addreſſes
and deſires of our ſelves, and others, in that behalfe, reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
diſcounte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nanced and oppoſed, and onely a corrupt
cloſure endeavoured with the King, on tearmes, ſerving
onely to his intereſt, and theirs that promoted the ſame;
And being thereupon (for the avoidance of the evil there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and to make way for ſome better ſettlement) neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to take extraordinary wayes of remedy (when the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
were denied;) Now to exhibit our utmoſt endeavors
for ſuch a ſettlement, whereupon we, and other Forces,
(with which the Kingdome hath ſo long beene burthened
above meaſure, and whoſe continuance ſhall not be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for the immediate ſafety and quiet thereof) may with
comfort to our ſelves, and honeſty towards the publique,
disband, and returne to our homes and callings; and to
the end mens jealouſies and feares may be removed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any intentions in us to hold up our ſelves in power, to
oppreſſe or domineer over the people by the ſword; And
that all men may fully underſtand thoſe grounds of Peace
and Government whereupon (they may reſt aſſured) We ſhall
for our parts acquieſce; We have ſpent much time to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101490:16"/>
and have at laſt (through the bleſſing of God) finiſhed
a Draught of ſuch a ſettlement, in the nature of an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the People for Peace amongſt themſelves; Which
we have lately preſented to the Honourable the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
now aſſembled in Parliament, and doe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
tender to the people of this Nation.</p>
            <p>We ſhal not otherwiſe commend it, then to ſay, It contains
the beſt and moſt hopefull Foundations for the Peace, &amp; fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
wel Government of this Nation, that we can deviſe or
think on, within the line of humane power, and ſuch, wherin
all the people intereſſed in this Land (that have not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
intereſts of advantage &amp; power over others, divided from
that which is common and publique) are indifferently and
equally provided for, ſave where any have juſtly forfeited
their ſhare in that common intereſt by oppoſing it, and ſo
rendred themſelves incapable thereof (at leaſt) for ſome
time: And we call the Conſciences of all that reade or hear
it, to witneſſe, whether wee have therein provided or
propounded any thing of advantage to our ſelves in any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
above others, or ought, but what is as good for one
as for another: And therefore as we doubt not but that (the
Parliament being now freed from the obſtructing and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
Councels of ſuch Members, by many of whom a
corrupt compliance with the Kings Intereſt hath beene dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
on, and all ſettlement otherwiſe hath hitherto beene
hindred) Thoſe remaining worthy Patriots to whom we
have preſented the Agreement, will for the maine allow
thereof, and give their ſeale of Approbation thereby; So
we deſire and hope, That all good People of <hi>England</hi> whoſe
heart God ſhall make ſenſible of their, and our common
concernment therein, and of the uſefulneſſe and ſutable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
thereof to the publique ends it holds forth, will cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially
embrace it, and by ſubſcription declare their
concurrence, and accord thereto, when it ſhall be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
to them, as is directed therein; wherein, if it
pleaſe God wee ſhall finde a good Reception of it with
the people of the Nation, or the Well-affected therein,
We ſhall rejoyce at the hoped good to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
which (through Gods mercy) may redound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from,
and that God hath vouchſafed thereby to make us
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101490:16"/>
inſtrumentall for any good ſettlement to this poor diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Country, as he hath formerly made us for the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of evill. But if God ſhall (in his Righteous Judgement
towards this Land) ſuffer the people to be ſo blinded as
not to ſee their own common good and freedome, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to be provided for therein, or any to be ſo deluded
(to their own and the publique prejudice) as to make op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
thereto, whereby the effect of it be hindred, we
have, yet, by the preparation and tender of it diſcharged
our Conſciences to God, and duty to our native Country
in our utmoſt endeavours for a ſettlement, (to the beſt of
our underſtandings) unto a juſt publique intereſt; And hope
we ſhall be acquitted before God and good men, from the
blame of any further troubles, diſtractions, or miſeries to
the Kingdom, which may ariſe through the neglect or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
thereof, or oppoſition thereto.</p>
            <p>Now whereas there are many good things in particular
ters which our own Reaſons &amp; obſervations or the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

of moderate Fines upon ſuch of the Kings party, as ſhal not

The ſetling of a Revenue for all neceſſary publique uſes,
in ſuch a way as the people may be moſt eaſed, The aſſigning
and aſcertayning of ſecurities for Souldiers Arrears,

things of like ſort being of a particular nature, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
very particular and mature conſideration, with lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

much Caution, that by taking away of preſent Evills grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
inconveniences may not enſue for want of other provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
in the room thereof, where it is neceſſary; and we
(for our parts) being far from any Deſire or thought to
aſſume or exerciſe a Law-giving, or Judiciall power over
the Kingdome, or to meddle in any thing ſave the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
ſetling of that power in the moſt equall and hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

this Agreement) and having not meanes nor time for, nor
the neceſſitie of ſome preſent generall ſettlement admitting
the delay of, ſuch a conſideration, as ſeems requiſite in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to ſuch numerous particulars, we have purpoſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
the inſerting of ſuch things into this Agreement.
But (as we have formerly expreſſed our deſires that way,
ſo) when the matters of publique Juſtice, and generall ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement

humbly to recommend ſuch particulars to the Parliament,

ſuch of them, at leaſt, as are of more neare and preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,
