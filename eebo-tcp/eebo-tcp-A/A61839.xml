         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat I take the boldness humbly to
present this <hi>short discourse</hi> to
your Majesties Sacred <hi>hand</hi> and
piercing <hi>eye;</hi> it is upon this
<hi>one</hi> and <hi>onely</hi> account, that how
mean soever <hi>the performance</hi> be, <hi>the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking</hi>
was in obedience to <hi>the command</hi>
of a most Gracious <hi>Master,</hi> your Majesties
<hi>Royal Father</hi> of Blessed Memory. The Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
this. When <hi>the Army</hi> had gotten <hi>the King</hi>
into their own <hi>custody</hi> out of the hands of
those that had long holden him <hi>in durance at
Holdenby:</hi> to put <hi>a blind</hi> upon the world,
<pb facs="tcp:98327:3"/>
they <hi>made a shew</hi> of much good towards him,
which (as soon after appeared) they never
<hi>meant</hi> him. Amongst other <hi>the pompous
civilities,</hi> wherewith (the better to cloak their
<hi>hypocrisie</hi>) they entertained him; it was
their pleasure to <hi>vouchsafe</hi> him the attendance
of some of his <hi>own Chaplains:</hi> which, though
it could <hi>merit</hi> little (for such <hi>a kindness</hi> could
not <hi>with justice</hi> have been denyed to a far
<hi>meaner person;</hi>) was yet <hi>a boon</hi> his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Goalers thought <hi>too big</hi> for him. In that
<hi>Summer Progress</hi> (such as it was) <hi>four</hi> of us
of his own naming, with <hi>the Clerk of his
Closet,</hi> were suffered to <hi>wait</hi> upon him. In
which time of <hi>waiting,</hi> (which was in <hi>August
MDCXLVII.</hi>) His Majesty, being then at
<hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> one day called me to him,
and told me he had <hi>a little work</hi> for me to do.
Some <hi>about him,</hi> it seems, had been often dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
with him about EPISCOPACY,
as it was <hi>claimed</hi> and <hi>exercised</hi> by <hi>the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
within this Realm. Which (whether
out of their <hi>good-will</hi> to him, or their <hi>no-good-will</hi>
to the Church, I am not able to say,)
<pb facs="tcp:98327:3"/>
they had endeavoured to represent unto him, as
not a little derogatory to <hi>the REGAL AU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THORITY,</hi>
as well in the point of <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi>
as of <hi>Prerogative:</hi> in the one, by
<hi>claiming the function</hi> as of Divine Right; in
the other, by <hi>exercising the Jurisdiction</hi> in
their own names. His Majesty said farther,
that he did not believe <hi>the Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by Bishops</hi> as it was <hi>by Law</hi> establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this Realm, to be in either of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
respects, or any other way <hi>prejudicial to
his Crown;</hi> and that he was in his own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>fully satisfied</hi> concerning the same: yet
signified his pleasure withal, that for the <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of others</hi> I should take <hi>these two
Objections</hi> into consideration, and give him
<hi>an Answer</hi> thereunto in writing. In <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>
to which his Majesties <hi>Royal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi>
after my return home, I forthwith (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to my <hi>bounden duty</hi>) addressed my
self to <hi>the work;</hi> and was drawing up <hi>an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer</hi>
to both <hi>the Objections,</hi> as well as I was
able; with a purpose to <hi>present</hi> the same (as
soon as it should be finished) to <hi>his Majesty</hi> in
<pb facs="tcp:98327:4"/>
writing, upon the first offered opportunity. But
behold, before I could bring the business <hi>ad
umbilicum,</hi> and quite <hi>finish</hi> what was under
my hand, <hi>the Scene of affairs</hi> was strangely
changed. The King trepann'd into <hi>the Isle of
Wight;</hi> the mask of <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> by long
wearing now grown so <hi>thin</hi> and <hi>useless,</hi> that
it was fit for nothing but to be <hi>thrown by;</hi> no
kind of <hi>impiety</hi> and <hi>villany,</hi> but durst appear
<hi>bare-faced</hi> and in the open Sun; high <hi>inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies</hi>
to the contempt of <hi>Authority</hi> every
where committed; <hi>Majesty</hi> it self trampled
upon by <hi>the vilest</hi> of the People; and <hi>the
hearts</hi> of all loyal honest men sadly oppressed
with <hi>griefs</hi> and <hi>fears.</hi> Yet had the men who
steered <hi>the Publick</hi> as they listed, (that they
might give themselves the more <hi>recreation,</hi>
amuse <hi>the world</hi> anew, and grace <hi>the black
Tragedy</hi> they were acting with the more <hi>varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>)
a mind to play <hi>one game</hi> more the next
year; to wit, <hi>the Treaty</hi> at the aforesaid <hi>Isle
of Wight.</hi> Where, assoon as I understood,
that by his Majestie<hi>'s nomination,</hi> I was to
give my <hi>attendance;</hi> I looked out <hi>the old
<pb facs="tcp:98327:4"/>
Papers</hi> which I had laid aside a good while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
<hi>made up</hi> what was then left <hi>unfinish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
and took <hi>the Copy</hi> with me to <hi>the Isle;</hi>
thinking that when <hi>the Treaty</hi> should be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
(for whilest it lasted his Majesty was taken
up with other <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>debates</hi> of higher
concern) I might possibly have the opportunity
to give his Majesty <hi>an account</hi> thereof. What
became of <hi>that Treaty,</hi> and what after ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is so <hi>well known</hi> to the world, that there
is <hi>no need,</hi> and withal so <hi>sad,</hi> that it can be
<hi>no pleasure,</hi> to remember. But thencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
were those <hi>Papers laid aside</hi> once again,
and destined to <hi>perpetual silence,</hi> had not a
<hi>debate</hi> lately started, concerning <hi>one of the
principal points</hi> therein handled, occasioned
some persons of eminent place and esteem in the
Church (and one of them <hi>conscious</hi> to the
aforesaid <hi>command</hi> laid upon me by <hi>the late
King,</hi>) to desire a sight of those <hi>Papers.</hi>
Which being by their encouragement now made
<hi>publick</hi> (though having little other to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
them, either to <hi>the world</hi> but <hi>Truth</hi>
and <hi>Plainness,</hi> or to your <hi>Majesty</hi> but that

lately published,
The most Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in God, the Lords
Arch-Bishops and Bishops of this
Realm, are said to have usurped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Majesties Prerogative Royal,
and to have proceeded in the high
Commission and other Ecclesiastical
Courts, contrary to the Laws and
Statutes of this Realm; It was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by his Majesties high Court of
Star-Chamber, the Twelfth day of
<hi>June</hi> last, that the opinion of the two
Lords chief Iustices, the Lord chief
Baron, and the rest of the Judges and
Barons should be had and certified in
those particulars, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
<pb facs="tcp:98327:6"/>
may not issue out of the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Courts in the Name of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.
Whether a Patent under the
great Seal be necessary for the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Ecclesiastical Courts, and
enabling Citations, Suspensions,
Excommunications, and other cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the Church. And whether Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
ought to be in the Kings
name, and under his Seal of Arms,
and the like for Institutions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
to Benefices, and Correction
of Ecclesiastical offences. Whether
Bishops, Arch-Deacons and other
Ecclesiastical persons may or ought to
keep any visitation at any time unless
they have express Commission or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
under the great Seal of <hi>England</hi>
to do it, and that as his Majesties Ui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors
only, and in his name and Right
alone.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, his Majesties said
Iudges having taken the same into
their serious consideration, did una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously
concur and agree in opinion,
and the first day of <hi>July</hi> last certified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their hands as followeth, That
Processes may issue out of the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
<pb facs="tcp:98327:6"/>
Courts in the name of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops;
and that a Patent under the
great Seal is not necessary for the
keeping of the said Ecclesiastical
Courts, or for enabling of Citations,
Suspensions, Excommunications and
other Censures of the Church; And
that it is not necessary that Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
Citations, or other Processes Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
in the said Courts, or Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
or Inductions to Benefices,
or correction of Ecclesiastical offences
by Censure in those Courts, be in the
Kings name or with the style of the
King, or under the Kings Seal, or
that their Seals of Office have in
them the Kings Arms; And that the
Statute of <hi>Primo Edvardi Sexti, cap.
secundo,</hi> which enacted the contrary,
is not now in force: And that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
Arch-Deacons and other Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
persons, may keep their Uisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
as usually they have done,
without Commission under the great
Seal of <hi>England</hi> so to do: which opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and resolutions being declared
under the hands of all his Majesties
said Iudges, and so certified into his
<pb facs="tcp:98327:7"/>
Court of Star-Chamber, were there
recorded: and it was by that Court
further ordered the fourth day of the
said moneth of <hi>July,</hi> that the said certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate
should be inrolled in all other his
Majesties Courts at <hi>Westminster,</hi>
and in the High Commission, and
other Ecclesiastical Courts, for the
satisfaction of all men, That the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
in the High Commission and

to the Laws and Statutes of the

            <p>And his Royal Majesty hath
thought sit, with advice of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,
that a publick Declaration of
these the opinions and resolutions of
his Reverend and Learned Iudges,
being agreeable to the Iudgement and
Resolutions of former times, should
be made known to all his Subjects,
as well to vindicate the legal proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of His Ecclesiastical Courts and
Ministers, from the unjust and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
imputation of invading or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching
on his Royal Prerogative,
as to settle the minds and stop the
mouths of all unquiet Spirits, that

for the future they presume not to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

from time to time claimed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
in <hi>Causes</hi> and over <hi>Persons Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical;</hi>
as also by whom, how,
and how far forth their said <hi>Power</hi>
hath been from time to time either
<hi>opposed,</hi> or <hi>maintained:</hi> shall undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
find that no persons in the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98327:10"/>
world have more freely acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and both by their writings and
actions more zealously, judiciously
and effectually asserted <hi>the Soveraign
Ecclesiastical power of Kings,</hi> then the
Protestant <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Divines</hi>
(whom our new Masters have been
pleased of late to call <hi>the Prelatical
party</hi>) in the Church of England have
done. Yet so far hath <hi>prejudice</hi> (or
something else) prevailed with some
persons of quality in these times of so
much loosness and distraction; as to
suffer themselves to be led into a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
or at leastwise to be willing the
people should be deceived into the
belief of these <hi>two things. First,</hi> that
the Opinion which maintaineth <hi>the
Ius divinum of Episcopacy</hi> is destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
of <hi>the Regal power.</hi> And <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
that <hi>Episcopal Iurisdiction,</hi> as it
was exercised before and at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of this present <hi>Parliament,</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:98327:10"/>
was derogatory from the honour of
<hi>the King,</hi> and prejudicial to the
just Rights and <hi>Prerogatives of his
Crown</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. Truely, they that know any
thing of the practises and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of <hi>the Anti-prelatical party,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ignorant, that their aims
(these or whatsoever other pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
notwithstanding) are clearly to
enlarge their own <hi>power</hi> by lessening
the <hi>Kings,</hi> and to raise their own <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states</hi>
upon the ruines of the <hi>Bishops.</hi>
And therefore howsoever the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
pretensions may seem at the first
appearance to proceed from a sense
of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> and a tenderness of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
any thing to be continued in
the kingdom which might tend to the
least <hi>diminution of his Majesties just po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
&amp; greatness.</hi> yet, (till their <hi>actions</hi>
look otherwise then for some time
past they have done) the pretenders
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98327:11"/>
must give us leave to think that their
meaning therein is rather to do <hi>the
Bishops</hi> hurt, then to do <hi>the King</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
and that their affections (so
far as by what is visible we are able
to judge thereof) are much what
alike the same towards <hi>them both.</hi>
But to leave their <hi>Hearts</hi> to the
judgement of him to whom they
must <hi>stand</hi> or <hi>fall:</hi> for the just de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of <hi>truth,</hi> and that (so far as we
can help it) <hi>the people</hi> be not abused
in this particular also, as in sundry
others they have been, by such men,
as are content to use <hi>the Kings name</hi>
when it may help on <hi>their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs;</hi>
I shall first set forth <hi>the two
main Objections</hi> severally to the best
advantage of <hi>the Objectors;</hi> and then
endeavour by a clear and satisfactory
<hi>answer</hi> to discover the weakness and
vanity of them both.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>The former objection.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98327:11"/>
in the <hi>Oath of Supremacy</hi> the supreme
<hi>power Ecclesistical</hi> is acknowledged
to be in <hi>the King alone;</hi> and by <hi>the
Statute of 1. Eliz.</hi> All jurisdictions
and preeminencies Spiritual and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
within the Realm of
England are <hi>restored to the Crown</hi> as
the ancient right thereof, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<hi>united and annexed</hi> thereunto:
<hi>the Bishops</hi> claiming their <hi>power</hi> and
<hi>jurisdiction</hi> to belong unto them <hi>as
of divine right,</hi> seemeth to be a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
violation of the said <hi>Oath</hi> and
<hi>Statute,</hi> and a real diminution of <hi>the
Regal power</hi> in and by the said <hi>Oath</hi>
and <hi>Statute</hi> acknowledged and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.
For whatsoever power is
of <hi>divine right,</hi> is immediatly deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>from God,</hi> and dependeth not
upon any earthly <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Potentate</hi>
whatsoever as superiour thereunto.
These two tearms, to be <hi>from Heaven,</hi>
and <hi>to be of Men,</hi> being used in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98327:12"/>
Scriptures as terms opposite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent,
and such as cannot be
both truly affirmed of the same
thing.</p>
               <p>IV. <hi>The latter objection.</hi> Setting
aside the dispute of <hi>jus divinum,</hi>
and whatsoever might be said either
for or against the same: the very
exercising of <hi>Episcopal jurisdiction</hi> in
such a manner as it was with us, <hi>the
Bishops</hi> issuing out their <hi>Summens,</hi>
giving <hi>Censures,</hi> and acting every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing in the Ecclesiastical
Courts, <hi>in their own</hi> and not in <hi>the
Kings name,</hi> seemeth to derogate
very much from <hi>the Regal power</hi> in
the point of Ecclesiastical Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
For whereas the Judges in <hi>the
Kings Bench, Common Plees,</hi> and
other Common-Law-Courts do issue
out their <hi>Writts,</hi> and make all their
<hi>Iudgments, Orders, Decrees, &amp;c.</hi> in
<hi>the Kings name;</hi> thereby acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98327:12"/>
both their <hi>Power</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
upon, and derived from <hi>the
Kings</hi> authority, and <hi>themselves</hi> in
the exercise of that Power to be but
his <hi>Ministers</hi> sent and authorzied by
him; and so give him the just ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of his <hi>Supremacy temporal:</hi> The
Bishops on the other side exercise <hi>a
spiritual power or jurisdiction in their
own names,</hi> and as it were by their
own authority, without any the
least acknowledgment of the effluxe
or emanation of that <hi>power</hi> or juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
from <hi>the King.</hi> Which cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
as it had undoubtedly its first
rise, and after-growth from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant
greatness of <hi>the Bishops of
Rome,</hi> who have usurped an unjust
authority as well over <hi>Kings</hi> and
<hi>Princes,</hi> as over their <hi>Fellow-Bishops,</hi>
laboured all they could to lessen the
authority of <hi>Kings,</hi> especially <hi>in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Ecclesiastical:</hi> so is the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98327:13"/>
thereof no otherwise to be est<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eemed
then as a rag or relique of
that <hi>Anti-Christian tyranny,</hi> which
was retained (as some other things
also of evil consequence were) in
those imperfect beginnings of <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi>
when <hi>the Popes power</hi> was
first abrogated under <hi>King Henry the
Eighth.</hi> But it was afterwards in a
more mature and perfect reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
taken in to consideration in the
Raign of <hi>King Edward the Sixth:</hi> and
remedy provided there-against by
<hi>an Act of Parliament</hi> made in the first
year of his Raign. Wherein it was
enacted, that <hi>all Summons, Citations,
and other Processes Ecclesiastical should
be made in the Kings name and with
the style of the King, as it is in Writts
original and judicial at the Common
Laws;</hi> and that the Teste thereof
only should be in the name of <hi>the
Bishop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:98327:13"/>
V. It is true indeed that this <hi>Statute
of King Edward</hi> was within a few
years after <hi>repealed,</hi> and so the old
usage and form again restored <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo
Mariae,</hi> and hath ever since so
continued during the Raigns of the
said Queen, of <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> of
K. <hi>Iames,</hi> and of <hi>his Majesty that now
is</hi> until this present <hi>Parliament,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any alteration or interruption.
But the repealing of the Statute of
<hi>primo Edw. 6.</hi> and the reception of
the former usage insuing thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ought not to be alleaged by the
<hi>Bishops,</hi> or to sway with any <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant:</hi>
inasmuch as that repeal was
made by <hi>Queen Mary,</hi> who was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
<hi>Papist,</hi> and who together with
that form of proceeding in <hi>the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Courts</hi> restored also the whole
<hi>Popish Religion,</hi> whereof that was
a branch. Neither ought the un-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
continuance of the said form
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98327:14"/>
under <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> and the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<hi>Kings,</hi> (whether it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
through inadvertency in the
State, or through the incessant <hi>arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi>
and practises of the more active
<hi>Bishops,</hi> some or other whereof had
alwayes a prevalent power with
those <hi>Princes</hi> in their several Raigns)
to hinder; but that, as the said man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of proceeding was in the said first
year of <hi>Edward 6.</hi> by the <hi>King</hi> and
<hi>the three Estates in Parliament</hi> adjud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to favour the usurped power of
<hi>the Bishops of Rome,</hi> and to trench
upon <hi>the Kings</hi> just and acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<hi>authority in matters Ecclesiastical</hi>
(as by the preamble of the said <hi>Act</hi>
doth sufficiently appear;) so it ought
to be still no otherwise esteemed
then as a branch of <hi>the Papal usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
highly derogatory to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>the King,</hi> and the rights of
his <hi>Crown.</hi> This is (as I conceive)
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98327:14"/>
the sum of all that hath been, and
the utmost of what (I suppose) can
be said in this matter.</p>

               <head>THE II. SECTION</head>
               <head type="sub">In answer to the former Objection.</head>
               <p>I. WHereunto I make answer
as followeth. To the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>Objection,</hi> I say <hi>first,</hi> that it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
of no force at all against those
<hi>Divines,</hi> who for the maintenance
of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> lay their claim under
another notion, and not under that
of <hi>Ius Divinum.</hi> Which expression,
for that it is (by reason of <hi>the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity</hi>
thereof) subject to be <hi>mistaken,</hi>
and that captious men are so willing
to <hi>mistake</hi> it for their own advantage;
might peradventure without loss of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98327:15"/>
                  <hi>Truth,</hi> or prejudice to <hi>the Cause,</hi> b<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
with as much prudence laid aside a<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
used, as in this, so in sundry other
disputes and controversies of these
Times.</p>
               <p>II. If it shall be replyed, that then
belike <hi>the Proctors for Episcopacy</hi> are
not yet well agreed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by what <hi>title</hi> they hold: and
that is a shrewd prejudice against
them, that they have <hi>no good title.</hi>
For it is ever supposed he that hath a
good title, knoweth what it is: and
we are to presume the <hi>power</hi> to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped,
when he that useth it cannot
well tell how he came by it. I say
therefore <hi>secondly,</hi> that <hi>the difference</hi>
between the Advocates for <hi>Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
is rather in <hi>the different manner</hi> of
expressing the same thing, then in
their <hi>different judgement</hi> upon the
substance of <hi>the matter.</hi> The one
sort making choise of <hi>an expression</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:98327:15"/>
which he knoweth he is able to make
good against all gainsayers, if they
will but understand him aright: the
other out of <hi>wariness</hi> or <hi>condescension</hi>
forbearing <hi>an expression,</hi> (no <hi>necessity</hi>
requiring the use of it,) which he
seeth to have been subject to so
much <hi>mis-construction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. For the truth is, all this ado
about <hi>Ius divinum</hi> is in the last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
no more then a meer <hi>verbal ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cety:</hi>
that term being not alwayes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in one and the same latitude of
<hi>signification.</hi> Sometimes it importeth
<hi>a divine precept</hi> (which is indeed the
<hi>primary</hi> and most <hi>proper</hi> significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:)
when it appeareth by some clear
express and peremptory <hi>command of
God</hi> in his word, to be <hi>the will of God</hi>
that the thing so commanded should
be perpetually and universally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.
Of which sort, setting aside
<hi>the Articles of the Creed,</hi> and <hi>the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98327:16"/>
duties of the Law</hi> (which are not
much pertinent to the present en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry)
there are, as I take it, very
few things that can be properly said
to be <hi>of divine positive right</hi> under
<hi>the New Testament.</hi> The Preaching
of <hi>the Gospel,</hi> and administration of
<hi>the Sacraments</hi> are <hi>two:</hi> which when
I have named, I think I have named
all.</p>
               <p>IV. But there is a <hi>secondary</hi> and
more <hi>extended</hi> signification of that
term, which is also of frequent use
among <hi>Divines.</hi> In which sense such
things, as having <hi>no express command</hi>
in the word, are yet found to have
authority and warrant from <hi>the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
example,</hi> or <hi>approbation</hi> either
of <hi>Christ</hi> himself, or his <hi>Apostles;</hi> and
have (in regard of the importance
and usefulness of <hi>the things</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves)
been held, by <hi>the consentient
judgement</hi> of all the Churches of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98327:16"/>
Christ in <hi>the primitive</hi> and <hi>succeeding</hi>
ages, needful to be continued: such
things I say are (though not so <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly</hi>
as the former, yet) usually and
<hi>interpretativè</hi> said to be of <hi>Divine
Right.</hi> Of which sort I take the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of <hi>the Keys,</hi> the distinction of
<hi>Presbyters and Deacons,</hi> and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things (not all perhaps of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
consequence) to be. Unto <hi>Ius
divinum</hi> in that former acception is
required <hi>a Divine Precept:</hi> in this
later, it sufficeth thereunto that a
thing be <hi>of Apostolical institution or
practice.</hi> Which <hi>ambiguity</hi> is the more
to be heeded, for that the observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof is of great use for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyding
of sundry <hi>mistakes</hi> that
through the ignorance or neglect
thereof daily happen to the enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of men in endless <hi>disputes,</hi> and
entangling their consciences in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary
<hi>scruples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:98327:17"/>
V. Now, that the Government of
the Churches of Christ by <hi>Bishops</hi> is
of <hi>divine right</hi> in that first and
stricter sence, is an <hi>Opinion</hi> at least
of great <hi>probability,</hi> and such as
may more easily and upon better
grounds be <hi>defended</hi> then <hi>confuted:</hi>
especially if in expounding those
<hi>Texts</hi> that are alleaged for it we give
such deference to the authority of
the Ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> and their <hi>expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions</hi>
thereof, as wise and sober men
have alwayes thought it fit we
should do. Yet because it is both
<hi>inexpedient</hi> to maintain a <hi>dispute</hi>
where it needs not, and <hi>needless</hi> to
contend for <hi>more,</hi> where <hi>less</hi> will
serve the turne: I finde that <hi>our
Divines</hi> that have travailed most in
this <hi>Argument,</hi> where they <hi>purposely</hi>
treat of it, do rather chuse to stand
to the tenure of Episcopacy <hi>ex A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicâ
designatione,</hi> then to hold a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98327:17"/>
contest upon the title of <hi>jus divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
no necessity requiring the
same to be done. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that so speak of this <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
as established by <hi>Divine
right,</hi> are not all of them neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
so to be understood, as if
they meant it in that first and
stricter sense. Sufficient it is for
the justification of <hi>the Church of
England</hi> in the constitution and
government thereof, that it is (as
certainly it is) <hi>of Divine right</hi> in
the latter and larger signification:
that is to say, <hi>of Apostolical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi>
and approbation; exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
by <hi>the Apostles</hi> themselves,
and by <hi>other persons</hi> in their times,
appointed and enabled thereunto
by them, according to the will of
our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of <hi>the Commission</hi> they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:98327:18"/>
VI. Which besides that it is
clear from evident <hi>Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi>
and from the testimony of
as ancient and <hi>authentique Records</hi>
as the world hath any to shew
for the attesting of any other part
of <hi>Ecclesiastical story;</hi> it is also in
truth a part of the established
Doctrine of <hi>the Church of England:</hi>
evidently deduced out of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
passages in the <hi>booke of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration,</hi>
(which book is Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
in the <hi>Articles</hi> of our
Religion <hi>Art. 36.</hi> Confirmed by
<hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> and Subscribed
unto by all persons that have
heretofore taken <hi>Orders</hi> in the
Church, or <hi>Degrees</hi> in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity;)
and hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
and uniformly Maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by our <hi>best Writers,</hi> and by all
the sober, orderly and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98327:18"/>
                  <hi>sons of this Church.</hi> The
point hath been so abundantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by sundry Learned men, and
cleared from the exceptions of
<hi>Novellists;</hi> that more need not
be said for the satisfaction of any
intelligent man that will but first
take the pains to read <hi>the books,</hi>
and then suffer himself to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of his <hi>own reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VII. Only I could wish, that
they who plead so eagerly for the
<hi>jus divinum of the Lords day,</hi> &amp; yet
reject (not without some scorn)
<hi>the jus divinum of Episcopacy,</hi>
would ask their own hearts (deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impartially therein) whether
it be any <hi>apparent difference</hi> in the
nature of <hi>the things</hi> themselves,
or in the strength of those <hi>reasons</hi>
that have been brought for either,
that leadeth them to have such
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98327:19"/>
different judgments thereof; or
rather some <hi>prejudicate conceit</hi> of
their own; which having former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fancied to themselves even as
they stood affected to <hi>parties,</hi> the
same <hi>affections</hi> still abiding, they
cannot easily lay aside. Which
<hi>partiality</hi> (for I am loath to call
it <hi>perversness</hi>) of spirit, is by so
much the more inexcusable in
this particular; by how much
<hi>Episcopal government</hi> seemeth to
be grounded upon <hi>Scripture-Texts</hi>
of greater pregnancy and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and attested by a fuller <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of Antiquity</hi> to have been Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly
and Universally observed
throughout the whole <hi>Christian
world,</hi> then <hi>the Lords day</hi> hath
hitherto been shewen to be.</p>
               <p>VIII. But should it be granted
that all <hi>the defenders of Episcopacy</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:98327:19"/>
did indeed hold it to be <hi>jure divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>
in the strictest and most proper
sence; yet could not <hi>the Objectors</hi>
thence reasonably conclude, that
it should be <hi>eo nomine</hi> inconsistent
with <hi>the Regal power,</hi> or so much
as derogatory in the least degree
to that <hi>Supream power Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi>
which by the Laws of our
<hi>Land</hi> is established, and by the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of our <hi>Church</hi> acknowledged
to be inherent in <hi>the Crown.</hi> As
themselves may easily see, if they
will but consider.</p>
               <p>IX. <hi>First,</hi> that <hi>Regal</hi> and <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopal</hi>
power are two powers of
quite different kinds: and such as
considered purely in those things
that are proper and <hi>essential</hi> to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
have no mutual <hi>relation</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
or <hi>dependence</hi> upon, the one
the other; neither hath either of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98327:20"/>
them any thing to do with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The one of them being
<hi>purely spiritual and internal,</hi> the
other <hi>external and temporal:</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
in regard of the <hi>Persons</hi> that
are to exercise them, or some <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental
circumstances</hi> appertaining
to <hi>the exercise</hi> thereof, it may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
the one to be somewayes <hi>help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
or <hi>prejudicial</hi> to the other; yet
is there no necessity at all that the
very <hi>powers themselves</hi> in respect
of their own natures should be
(at that distance) either of them
so <hi>destructive</hi> of other, but that
they might consist well enough
together. Yea although either
of them or both should claime
(as indeed they both may do) to
be of <hi>divine right</hi> independently
upon the other. Let any man
come up to the point, and shew
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98327:20"/>
if he can, how and wherein <hi>the
Episcopal power</hi> is any thing at all
diminished by affirming <hi>the Regal</hi>
to be of divine right; or how
and wherein <hi>the Regal power</hi> is at
all Prejudiced, by affirming <hi>the
Episcopal</hi> to be of divine right.
The opposition between those
two Terms, <hi>To be from Heaven</hi>
and <hi>To be of Men,</hi> which was obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
cometh not home enough:
unless we should affirm them both
of one and the same power <hi>in the
same respect.</hi> Which since we do
not; that opposition hindereth
not, but that <hi>the same power</hi> may
be said to be of both <hi>in divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
viz.</hi> to be <hi>from Heaven,</hi> or
<hi>of God,</hi> in respect of <hi>the substance</hi>
of the thing in the general; and
yet to be <hi>of Men</hi> in respect of <hi>the
determination</hi> of sundry particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98327:21"/>
requisite unto the lawful
and laudable <hi>exercise</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>X. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that the derivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of any <hi>power from God</hi> doth
not necessarily infer the <hi>non-subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
of the persons in whom that
<hi>power</hi> resideth to all other men.
For doubtless the power that <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
have over their children,
<hi>husbands</hi> over their wives, <hi>masters</hi>
over their servants, is <hi>from Heaven,
of God</hi> and not <hi>of Men.</hi> Yet are
<hi>Parents, Husbands, Masters</hi> in the
exercises of their several respective
<hi>powers</hi> subject to <hi>the power,</hi> juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
and Laws of their lawful
<hi>Soveraigns.</hi> And I suppose it
would be a very hard matter for
any man to find out a clear and
satisfactory reason of difference
between <hi>the Ecclesiastical</hi> power
and <hi>the Oeconomical;</hi> why <hi>the one,</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:98327:21"/>
because it claimeth to be <hi>of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Right</hi> should be therefore
thought to be injurious to <hi>Regal
power,</hi> and <hi>the other</hi> (though claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the same manner) not to be
injurious.</p>
               <p>XI. <hi>Thirdly, the Ministerial po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,</hi>
in that which is common to
<hi>Bishops</hi> with their <hi>fellow-Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
viz. the Preaching of the VVord
and administration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
&amp;c.</hi> is confessed to be <hi>from
Heaven</hi> and <hi>of God;</hi> and yet no
prejudice at all conceived to be
done thereby to <hi>the Regal Power:</hi>
because <hi>the Ministers</hi> who exercise
that power are <hi>the Kings subjects,</hi>
and are also in the executing of
those very acts that are proper to
their <hi>Ministerial functions</hi> to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
and ordered by <hi>the Kings
Ecclesiastical Lawes.</hi> A man might
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98327:22"/>
therefore justly wonder, (but
that it is no new thing to find in <hi>the
bag</hi> of such <hi>Merchants,</hi> as we have
now to deal with, <hi>pondus &amp; pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>)
how it should come to pass
that <hi>the Episcopal Power,</hi> in that
which is peculiar to <hi>Bishops</hi> above
other their brethren in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
<hi>viz. the Ordaining of Priests
and Deacons and the managing of
the Keyes,</hi> cannot be said to be <hi>of
God,</hi> but it must be forthwith
condemned to be highly deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
to <hi>the Regal Power:</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<hi>the Bishops</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
themselves as freely as any
others whosoever, to be <hi>the Kings
subjects,</hi> and submit themselves,
with as much willingness (I dare
say, and some <hi>Presbyterians</hi>
know I speak but the truth) as
the meanest of their <hi>fellow-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi>
do, to be limited in exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98327:22"/>
the proper <hi>Acts of their
Episcopal Functions</hi> by such
<hi>Lawes</hi> as have been by <hi>Regal
Power</hi> established in this Realm.
<hi>The King</hi> doth no more chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
to himselfe as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him by vertue of his <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
Ecclesiastical,</hi> the power
of <hi>Ordaining</hi> Ministers, <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating</hi>
scandalous offenders,
or doing any other act of <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Office</hi> in his own person; then
he doth the power of <hi>Preaching,</hi>
administring <hi>the Sacraments,</hi> or
doing any other act of <hi>Ministerial
office</hi> in his own person: but leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the performance of all such
<hi>acts</hi> of either sort unto such <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
as the said several respective
<hi>powers</hi> do of divine right belong
unto; <hi>viz.</hi> of the one sort to <hi>the
Bishops,</hi> and of the other to <hi>all
Preists.</hi> Yet doth <hi>the King</hi> by
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98327:23"/>
virtue of that <hi>Supremacy,</hi> chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
<hi>a power</hi> as belonging unto
him in the right of his Crown,
to <hi>make Laws</hi> as well concerning
<hi>Preaching,</hi> administring <hi>the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
and other <hi>acts</hi> belonging
to the function of a <hi>Priest,</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Ordination</hi> of Ministers,
proceedings in matters of <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical</hi>
cognisance in the <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Courts,</hi> and other <hi>acts</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the function of <hi>a Bishop.</hi> To
which <hi>Lawes,</hi> as well <hi>the Priests</hi>
as the <hi>Bishops,</hi> are subject, and
ought to submit to be limited and
regulated thereby in <hi>the exercise</hi> of
those their several respective <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers;</hi>
their claim to a <hi>Ius divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
and that their said several
<hi>powers are of God,</hi> notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
I demand then: As to <hi>the
Regal Power,</hi> is not the case of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98327:23"/>
                  <hi>Bishops</hi> and of <hi>the Ministers</hi> every
way alike? Do they not both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
their <hi>Powers</hi> to be <hi>of God?</hi>
And are they not yet for all that
both bound in <hi>the exercise</hi> of those
powers to obey <hi>the King</hi> and his
<hi>Laws?</hi> Is there not clearly the same
reason of both? How then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it to pass, that these are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
innocent, and those guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
Can any think God will
wink at such foul <hi>partiality?</hi> or
account them <hi>pure with the bag of
deceitful weights?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XII. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> that there can
be no fear of any danger to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
to the prejudice of <hi>the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
power</hi> from the opinion that
Bishops are <hi>jure divino,</hi> unless
that opinion should be stretched
to one of these <hi>two</hi> constructions:
<hi>viz.</hi> as if it were intended ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
1. that <hi>all the Power</hi> which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98327:24"/>
                  <hi>Bishops</hi> have legally exercised in
Christian Kingdomes did belong
to them as <hi>of divine right;</hi> or 2.
that <hi>Bishops</hi> living under <hi>Christian
Kings,</hi> might at least exercise so
much of their power as is <hi>of divine
right</hi> after their own pleasure,
without, or even <hi>against the Kings</hi>
leave, or without respect to <hi>the
Laws and Customes</hi> of the Realm.
Neither of which is any part of
our meaning. All <hi>power,</hi> to the
exercise whereof our <hi>Bishops</hi> have
pretended, cometh under one of
the <hi>two</hi> heads: of <hi>Order,</hi> or of
<hi>Iurisdiction.</hi> The Power of <hi>Order</hi>
consisteth partly in <hi>preaching</hi>
the word and other offices of <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
VVorship;</hi> common to them
with their <hi>fellow-Ministers;</hi> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>Ordaining Preists and Deacons</hi>
admitting them to their <hi>Particular
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98327:24"/>
Cures,</hi> and other things of like
nature, peculiar to them alone.
The power of <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> is
either <hi>Internal</hi> in retaining and
remitting sins <hi>in foro conscientiae,</hi>
common to them also (for <hi>the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
of the authority, though
with some difference of <hi>degree,</hi>)
with other <hi>Ministers:</hi> or <hi>External</hi>
for the outward government of
the Church in some parts thereof
peculiar to them alone. For that
<hi>external power</hi> is either <hi>Directive</hi>
in prescribing rules and orders
to those under their jurisdictions,
and making <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
to be observed by the Church;
wherein <hi>the inferior Clergy</hi> by their
Representatives in <hi>Convocation</hi>
have their votes as well as <hi>the
Bishops;</hi> and both dependently
upon <hi>the King</hi> (for they cannot
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98327:25"/>
either meet without his <hi>VVrit,</hi> or
<hi>treat</hi> without his <hi>Commission,</hi> or
<hi>establish</hi> without his Royal <hi>Assent:</hi>)
or <hi>Iudiciary</hi> and <hi>Coercive,</hi> in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sentence <hi>in foro exteriori</hi> in
matters of Ecclesiastical cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance,
<hi>Excommunicating, Fining,
Imprisoning</hi> offenders, and the like.
Of these <hi>powers</hi> some branches,
not onely in the exercise thereof,
but even in the very substance of
<hi>the Power</hi> it selfe, (as namely that
of <hi>external jurisdiction coercive,</hi>)
are by <hi>the Laws</hi> declared, and by
<hi>the Clergy</hi> acknowledged to be
wholly and entirely derived from
<hi>the King,</hi> as the sole fountain of
all authority of <hi>external Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi>
whether <hi>Spiritual</hi> or <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi>
within the Realm; and
consequently <hi>not of divine right.</hi>
Other-some, although the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98327:25"/>
of the power it self be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<hi>from God</hi> and not <hi>from
the King,</hi> as those of <hi>Preaching,
Ordaining, Absolving &amp;c.</hi> Yet
are they so subject to be inhibited,
limited, or otherwise regulated
in the <hi>outward exercise</hi> of that
power by <hi>the Laws and Customes</hi>
of the Land, as that the whole
execution thereof still depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
upon <hi>the Regal Authority.</hi>
And how can <hi>the gross</hi> of that
<hi>Power</hi> be prejudicial to <hi>the King</hi>
or his <hi>Supremacy,</hi> whereof <hi>all the
parts</hi> are confessed either to be
<hi>derived</hi> from him, or not to be
<hi>executed</hi> without him?</p>
               <p>XIII. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> that if <hi>Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
must be therefore concluded
to be repugnant to <hi>Monarchy,</hi>
because it claimeth to be <hi>of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Right:</hi> then must <hi>Monarchs</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:98327:26"/>
either suffer within their domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
no form of <hi>Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
at all (and then will <hi>Church,</hi>
and with it <hi>Religion,</hi> soon fall to
the ground;) or else they must
devise some <hi>new model of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
such as never was yet used
or challenged in any part of the
Christian world; since no form
of <hi>Government</hi> ever yet used, or
challenged, but hath claimed to a
<hi>Ius divinum</hi> as well as <hi>Episcopacy:</hi>
yea, I may say truly, every one of
them with far more noise, though
with far less reason then <hi>Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
hath done. And therefore of
what party soever <hi>the objectors</hi>
are, (<hi>Papists, Presbyterians,</hi> or
<hi>Independents</hi>) they shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
extreamly <hi>Partial</hi> against
the honest <hi>Regular Protestant;</hi> in
condemning him as an enemy to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98327:26"/>
                  <hi>Regal Power</hi> for holding that in
his way, which (if it be justly
chargeable with such a crime,)
themselves holding the very same
in their several wayes, are every
whit as deeply guilty of, as he.</p>
               <p>XIIII. <hi>Lastly,</hi> that this their
<hi>partiality</hi> is by so much the more
inexcusable, by how much the
true <hi>English Protestant</hi> for his
government not onely hath a
better title to a <hi>Ius divinum</hi> then
any of the other <hi>three</hi> have for
theirs; but also pleadeth the same
with more <hi>caution</hi> and <hi>modesty,</hi>
then any of them do. Which of
the <hi>four Pretenders</hi> hath the best
<hi>title,</hi> is no part of the business we
are now about. The tryal of that
will rest upon the strength of the
<hi>arguments</hi> that are brought to
maintain it: wherein <hi>the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:98327:27"/>
perhaps will not find any
very great advantage beyond the
rest of those that contest for it.
But let the <hi>right</hi> be where it will
be; we will for the present sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them all to have <hi>equal title</hi>
(and thus far indeed they are <hi>equal,</hi>
that every one taketh his own to
be best:) and it shall suffice to
shew, that <hi>the Ius Divinum</hi> is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by <hi>the Episcopal party</hi> with
more calmeness and moderation,
and with less derogation from <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Dignity,</hi> then by any other of
<hi>the three.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XV. For <hi>First,</hi> the rest when
they spake of <hi>Ius Divinum</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to their several waves of
<hi>Church-Government,</hi> take it in the
highest elevation, in the first and
<hi>strictest sense. The Papist</hi> groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<hi>the Popes Oecumenical Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:98327:27"/>
upon Christs command, to
<hi>Peter</hi> to execute it, and to <hi>all the
Flock</hi> of Christ (<hi>Princes</hi> also as
well as others) to submit to him
as their <hi>universal Pastor</hi> The
<hi>Presbyterian</hi> cryeth up his Model
of <hi>Government and Discipline,</hi>
(though minted in the last by-gon
Century,) as the <hi>very scepter of
Christs Kingdome,</hi> whereunto all
<hi>Kings</hi> are bound to submit theirs;
making it as unalterable and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably
necessary to <hi>the being</hi> of a
Church, as the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
are. The <hi>Independent Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratist</hi>
also, upon that grand prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of <hi>Puritanisme</hi> common to
him with the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> (the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>root</hi> of almost all <hi>the Sects</hi> in the
world) <hi>viz</hi> That nothing is to be
ordered in <hi>Church-matters,</hi> other,
or otherwise then <hi>Christ</hi> hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98327:28"/>
in his Word; holdeth
that <hi>any company</hi> of people ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together by mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in a Church-way is <hi>Iure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino</hi>
free and absolute within it
self, to govern it self by such <hi>rules</hi>
as it shall judge agreeable to Gods
Word, without dependence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any but <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> alone, or
subjection to any <hi>Prince, Prelate,</hi>
or other <hi>humane person</hi> or <hi>Consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
whatsoever. All these you see
do not onely claim to a <hi>Ius Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinum,</hi>
and that of a very high na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but in setting down their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
weave in some expresses
tending to the diminution of the
<hi>Ecclesiastical Supremacy</hi> of Princes.
Whereas <hi>the Episcopal Party,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meddle with <hi>the power of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
nor are ordinarily very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to press the <hi>Ius Divinum,</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:98327:28"/>
but rather purposely <hi>decline</hi> the
mentioning of it, as a term sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to misconstruction (as hath
been said) or else so <hi>interpret</hi> it,
as not of necessity to import any
more then <hi>an Apostolical instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
Yet <hi>the Apostles</hi> authority in
that institution, being warranted
by <hi>the example,</hi> and (as they doubt
not) <hi>the direction</hi> of their Master
<hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> they worthily esteem
to be so reverend and obligatory;
as that they would not for a world
have <hi>any hand</hi> in, or willingly and
deliberately contribute <hi>the least
assistance</hi> towards (much less bind
themselves by <hi>solemn League and
Covenant to endeavour</hi>) the extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that <hi>Government;</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

in their consciences obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
to the uttermost of their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98327:29"/>
to endeavour <hi>the preservation</hi>
and continuance thereof in these

the same, wheresoever <hi>it is not,</hi>
or wheresoever it hath been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
(under any whatsoever
pretence) unhappily <hi>laid aside,</hi> or
<hi>abolished.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XVI. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the rest (not by
<hi>remote inferences,</hi> but) by immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
and <hi>natural deduction</hi> out of
their own acknowledged <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
do some way or other deny
<hi>the Kings Supremacy in matters Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical:</hi>
either claiming a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> over him, or
pleading a priviledge of <hi>Exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
from under him. The <hi>Papists</hi>
do it both wayes; in their several
doctrines of <hi>the Popes Supremacy,</hi>
and of <hi>the Exemption of the Clergy.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98327:29"/>
The Puritances</hi> of both sorts, who
think they have sufficiently confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
every thing they have a mind
to mislike, if they have once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
it <hi>Popish</hi> and <hi>Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
do yet herein (as in very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other things, and some of them
of the most dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence)
symbolize with the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi>
and after a sort divide that
branch of <hi>Antichristianisme</hi> whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
between them: <hi>The Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
claiming to their Consistories
as full and absolute spiritual <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
over Princes,</hi> (with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
even to <hi>excommunicate</hi> them,
if they shall see cause for it,) as
<hi>the Papists</hi> challenge to belong to
<hi>the Pope:</hi> And <hi>the Independents</hi>
exempting their <hi>Congregations</hi>
from all <hi>spiritual subjection</hi> to
them, in as ample manner, as <hi>the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98327:30"/>
Papists</hi> do their <hi>Clergy.</hi> Whereas
the English <hi>Protestant Bishops</hi> and
Regular Clergy, as becometh <hi>good
Christians</hi> and <hi>good Subjects,</hi> do
neither pretend to any <hi>Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
over <hi>the Kings</hi> of England, nor
withdraw their <hi>subjection</hi> from
them: but acknowledge them to
have <hi>Soveraign Power</hi> over them,
as well as over their other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
and that in all matters <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical</hi>
as well as <hi>Temporal.</hi> By
all which it is clear, that <hi>the Ius
Divinum of Episcopacy,</hi> as it is
maintained by those they call
(<hi>stylo novo</hi>) the Prelatical party
in England, is not an opinion of
so dangerous a nature, nor so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory
to <hi>the Regal Powers,</hi> as
the Adversaries thereof would
make the world believe it is: but
that rather, of all the forms of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98327:30"/>
                  <hi>Church-government</hi> that ever yet
were endeavoured to be brought
into <hi>the Churches of Christ,</hi> it is
the most innocent in that behalf.</p>

               <p>1. HAving thus cleared <hi>the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion</hi>
held concerning <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy</hi>
in the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
from the crime unjustly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
upon it by the Adversaries,
(but whereof in truth themselves
are deeply guilty) in their <hi>former
Objection:</hi> our next business will
be the easier, to justifie it in <hi>the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98327:31"/>
Practise</hi> also from the like charge
laid against it in <hi>the later Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
by shewing that <hi>the Iurisdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
exercised by the <hi>Bishops</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this Realm, (and namely in that
particular which <hi>the Objectors</hi>
urge with most vehemency, of
<hi>acting</hi> so many things <hi>in their own
names,</hi>) is no way derogatory to
<hi>the Kings Majesties Power</hi> or <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi>
Wherein it were enough
for the satisfaction of every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
man, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
to any farther <hi>particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,</hi>
to shew the impertinency
of <hi>the Objectors</hi> from these two <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi>
Considerations.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>First</hi> that <hi>the Bishops</hi> have
exercised no <hi>Iurisdiction in foro
externo</hi> within this Realm, but
such as hath been granted unto
them by the successive <hi>Kings of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98327:31"/>
England;</hi> neither have challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any such <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> to belong
unto them by any inherent right
or title in their <hi>persons</hi> or <hi>Callings,</hi>
but onely by emanation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation
from <hi>the Royal Authority.</hi>
The very words of the Statute
<hi>primo. Edw. 6.</hi> in the objection
mentioned run thus, <hi>Seeing that
all authority of jurisdiction Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
and Temporal is derived and
deducted from the Kings Majesty
as Supream head—and so justly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by the Clergy of the said
Realms, and that all Courts Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
be kept by no other power or
authority either forraign or within
the Realms, but by the authority of
his most Excellent Majesty &amp;c.</hi>
Now the regular exercise of a
<hi>Derived power</hi> is so far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying,
or any way diminishing
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98327:32"/>
that <hi>Original power</hi> from whence
it is derived, as that it rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
and establisheth the same.
Yea, the further such <hi>derived
power</hi> is extended and enlarged
in the exercise thereof, so as it
be <hi>regular,</hi> (that is, so long as it
containeth it self within the
bounds of its <hi>grant,</hi> and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not the limits prefixed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
by that <hi>Original power</hi> that
granted it) the more it serveth to
set forth the honour and greatness
of that <hi>Original power;</hi> since the
vertue of the <hi>efficient Cause</hi> is best
known by the greatness of <hi>the
effect:</hi> for <hi>propter quod unumquod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
est tale, illud ipsum est magis
tale.</hi> As the <hi>warmth</hi> of the room
doth not lessen <hi>the heat</hi> of the
fire upon the hearth, but is rather
a signe of <hi>the greatness</hi> of that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98327:32"/>
heat: nor doth the abundance of
<hi>sap</hi> in <hi>the branches</hi> cause any
abatement in <hi>the root,</hi> but is
rather an evident demonstration
of the greater <hi>plenty</hi> there.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that it is one of
the greatest follies in the world,
to endeavour in good earnest to
maintain any thing by <hi>argument</hi>
when we have the evidence of
<hi>Sence</hi> or <hi>Experience</hi> to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
For what is it <hi>cum ratione
insanire,</hi> if this be not? To deny
fire to be <hi>hot,</hi> or water to be
<hi>moist,</hi> or snow to be <hi>white;</hi> when
<hi>our sences</hi> enform us they are such?
Or to prove by argument that
<hi>life</hi> may be perpetuated by the
help of <hi>art</hi> and good <hi>dyet,</hi> or
that <hi>infants</hi> are capable of <hi>faith</hi>
or <hi>instruction</hi> by ordinary means;
when <hi>Experience</hi> sheweth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98327:33"/>
Now <hi>the Experience</hi> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
fourscore years, ever since
the beginning of <hi>Queen Elizabeths</hi>
Raign, doth make it most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the exercise of <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Iurisdiction</hi> by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
<hi>Bishops</hi> here, was so far
from diminishing <hi>the power,</hi> or
eclipsing <hi>the glory</hi> of the Crown,
that <hi>the Kings</hi> and <hi>Queens</hi> of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
never enjoyed their <hi>Royal
power</hi> in a fuller measure, or
flourished with greater lustre, <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
and prosperity, then when
<hi>the Bishops</hi> (by their favour) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
the full liberty of their
<hi>Courts, jurisdictions, honours and
priviledges</hi> according to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
grants of former <hi>Kings</hi> and
<hi>the Lawes and Customes</hi> of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
On the other side; in what
condition of <hi>power</hi> and <hi>honour</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:98327:33"/>
(otherwise then in the hearts of
his <hi>oppressed Subjects</hi>) our most
pious and gracious <hi>Soveraign</hi>
that now is hath stood, and at
this present standeth, through
the prevalency of <hi>the Smectymnuan
Faction;</hi> ever since they had the
opportunity and forehead from
lopping off (as was at first pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended)
some <hi>luxuriant super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities</hi>
(as they at least imagined
them to be) in the <hi>branches</hi> of
Episcopal Jurisdiction (as <hi>High
Commission, Oath ex officio, &amp;c.</hi>) to
proceed to take away <hi>Episcopacy</hi>
it self <hi>Root and Branch:</hi> it were a
happy thing for us, if the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Experience of these late
Times would suffer us to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
So as we now look upon
that short <hi>Aphorisme</hi> so usual with
his Majesties Royal Father [NO
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98327:34"/>
BISHOP, NO KING]
not as a <hi>sentence</hi> onely full of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<hi>truth</hi> when it was uttered; but
rather as a sad <hi>prophecy</hi> of future
<hi>events,</hi> since come to pass. The
miseries of these wasting divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
both in <hi>the Church</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth</hi>
we cannot with any
reason hope to see an end of, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
it shall please Almighty God
in his infinite mercy to a sinful na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to restore them both (<hi>King</hi>
and <hi>Bishops</hi>) to their Antient, Just
and Rightful <hi>power:</hi> and in order
thereunto graciously to hear <hi>the
weak prayers</hi> of a small oppressed
Party, (yet coming from <hi>loyal
hearts,</hi> and going <hi>not out of feigned
lips</hi>) beyond the loud crying <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,
Sacriledges, and Oppressions</hi>
of those that now exercise an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
Soveraignty over their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98327:34"/>
Subjects without either <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi>
or <hi>Mercy,</hi> together with the
abominable <hi>hypocrisie</hi> and <hi>disloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty</hi>
that hath so long raigned in
them and their adherents.</p>
               <p>IV. Those two <hi>general Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,</hi>
although they might (as
I said) suffice to take away the
force of <hi>the Objection,</hi> without
troubling our selves, or the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with any farther answer
thereunto: yet that <hi>the Objectors</hi>
may not have the least occasion
given them to quarrel the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
as if we did purposely
<hi>decline a just tryal,</hi> we shall come
up a little closer, and examine
more <hi>particularly</hi> every material
point, in the order as they lye in
<hi>the Objection</hi> aforesaid. And the
<hi>Points</hi> are three.</p>
               <p>1. That the manner used by
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98327:35"/>
                  <hi>the Bishops,</hi> in sending out their
Summons, <hi>&amp;c. in their own
names,</hi> is contrary to the form
and order of <hi>other Courts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That such <hi>forms of Process</hi>
seem to have at first proceeded
from the Usurped power of <hi>the
Bishops of Rome,</hi> who laboured
by all possible means to bring
down <hi>the Regal Power,</hi> and set
up <hi>their own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That upon these very grounds
the custome was altered by <hi>Act
of Parliament,</hi> and <hi>a Statute</hi>
made <hi>1. Ewd. VI.</hi> (howsoever
since repealed and discontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,)
that all <hi>Processes Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical</hi>
should be made in <hi>the
Kings name,</hi> and not in <hi>the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>V. As to <hi>the first point,</hi> true
it is that the manner used by <hi>the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98327:35"/>
Bishops</hi> in the <hi>Ecclesiastical Courts,
(viz.</hi> in issuing out <hi>Summons, Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Processes,</hi> giving <hi>Iudgments</hi>
&amp;c. in <hi>their own names,</hi> and not
in <hi>the Kings,</hi>) is different from
the manner used in <hi>the Kings
Bench, Exchequer, Chancery,</hi> and
sundry other Courts. But that
difference neither doth of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
import an <hi>independency</hi> of <hi>the
Ecclesiastical Courts</hi> upon <hi>the King,</hi>
nor did in all probability arise at
the beginning from the opinion of
any such <hi>independency;</hi> nor ought
in reason to be construed as a <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acknowledgement</hi>
of the Kings au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and <hi>Supremacy Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</hi>
For</p>
               <p>VI. <hi>First</hi> there is between such
Courts as are <hi>the Kings own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Courts,</hi> and such Courts
as are not, a great difference in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98327:36"/>
this point. Of the former sort are
especially <hi>the Kings Bench</hi> and
<hi>Chancery:</hi> as also the Court of
<hi>Common Pleas, Exchequer, Iustices
of Goal-delivery &amp;c.</hi> In <hi>the Kings
Bench</hi> the Kings themselves in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times have often <hi>personally</hi> sate;
whence it came to have the name
of the <hi>Kings Bench;</hi> neither was it
tyed to any particular place, but
followed <hi>the Kings Person.</hi> At this
day also all <hi>Writs</hi> returnable there
run in this style, <hi>Coram nobis,</hi> and
not (as in some other Courts) <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram
Iustitiariis nostris</hi> or the like:
and all <hi>judicial Records</hi> there are
styled, and <hi>the Pleas</hi> there holden
entred, <hi>Coram Rege,</hi> and not <hi>coram
Iustitiariis Domini Regis.</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals
also are made from <hi>inferiour
Iudges</hi> in other Courts to the
<hi>King in Chancery;</hi> because in the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98327:36"/>
construction of the Lawes the
Kings <hi>Personal Power</hi> and <hi>Presence</hi>
is supposed to be there: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Sub-poena</hi>'s granted out of
that Court, and all matters of
<hi>Record</hi> passed there run in the same
style <hi>Coram Rege &amp;c.</hi> Forasmuch
as in <hi>the Iudges</hi> in these <hi>two Courts</hi>
there is a more immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of <hi>the Kings Personal
power</hi> and presence, then in <hi>the
Iudges</hi> of those other Courts of
<hi>Common Pleas, Exchequer, &amp;c.</hi>
Which yet by reason of his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
<hi>virtual power</hi> and presence
are the Kings <hi>immediate Courts</hi>
too. In regard of which his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<hi>virtual power,</hi> although
the style of the Writs and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
there be not <hi>Coram nobis,
Coram Rege,</hi> as in the former, but
onely <hi>Coram Iustitiariis, Coram
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98327:37"/>
Baronibus nostris, &amp;c.</hi> yet inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as <hi>the Iudges</hi> in those Courts
are the Kings <hi>immediate sworn Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi>
to execute justice, and to
do equal right to all the Kings
people <hi>in his name,</hi> therefore all
<hi>Processes, Pleas, Acts</hi> and <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
are made and done in <hi>those
Courts,</hi> as well as in the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<hi>in the Kings name.</hi> But in such
<hi>Courts</hi> as do not suppose any
such <hi>immediate</hi> Representation or
presence of the Kings either <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal</hi>
or <hi>virtual Power,</hi> as that
thereby they may be holden and
taken to be <hi>the Kings own immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Courts,</hi> the case is far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
For neither are <hi>the Iudges</hi> in
those Courts sworn <hi>the Kings
Iudges,</hi> to administer Justice and
do right to the Kings subjects <hi>in
his name and stead:</hi> nor do they
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98327:37"/>
take upon them the authority, to
<hi>cite</hi> any person, or to give any
<hi>sentence,</hi> or to do any <hi>act</hi> of Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
<hi>in the Kings name;</hi> having
never been by him authorized so
to do. Of this sort are amongst
others (best known to them that
are skilled in <hi>the Laws</hi> of this
Realm) all <hi>Courts-Baron</hi> held by
the Lord of a Manner, <hi>Customary
Courts of Copyholders, &amp;c</hi> and such
<hi>Courts</hi> as are held by the Kings
grant, by <hi>Charter</hi> to some <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
as to a <hi>City, Borough,</hi> or
<hi>Vniversity;</hi> or els by long usage
and <hi>prescription</hi> of time. In all
which <hi>Courts,</hi> and if there be any
other of like nature, <hi>Summons</hi> are
issued out, and <hi>Iudgements</hi> given,
and all other <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Proceedings</hi>
made and done in the name of
such persons as have chief autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98327:38"/>
in the said <hi>Courts,</hi> and not in
the name of <hi>the King:</hi> So as the
styles run thus, <hi>A. B. Major civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis
Ebor. N. M. Cancellarius V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversitatis
Oxon.</hi> and the like; and
not <hi>Carolus Dei gratia, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VII. Upon this ground it is
that our Lawyers tell us out of
<hi>Bracton,</hi> that in case of <hi>Bastar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
to be certified by <hi>the Bishop,</hi>
no inferiour Court, as <hi>London,
Yorke, Norwich,</hi> or any other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation
can write to <hi>the
Bishop</hi> to require him to certify:
but any of the Kings Courts at
Westminister (as <hi>Common Pleas,
Kings Bench &amp;c.</hi>) may write to
him to certify in that case. The
reason is, Because <hi>Nullus alius prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Regem potest Episcopo deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare
inquisitionem faciendam.</hi> Which
maketh it plain that <hi>the Kings
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98327:38"/>
immediate powe</hi> (either <hi>personal,</hi>
or <hi>virtual</hi>) is by the Law supposed
to be <hi>present</hi> in <hi>Courts</hi> of the one
sort, not of the other: the one
sort being <hi>his own immediate Courts,</hi>
and the other not.</p>
               <p>VIII. Now that <hi>the Ecclesiastical
Courts</hi> wherein <hi>the Bishops</hi> exercise
their Jurisdiction, are of <hi>the latter
sort,</hi> I doubt not but our <hi>Law-books</hi>
will afford plenty of arguments
to prove it, beyond all possibility
of contradiction or cavil. Which
being little versed in those studies
I leave for them to find out who
have leisure to search <hi>the books,</hi>
and do better understand the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
constitution, differences and
bounds of <hi>the several Courts</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this Realm. <hi>One argument</hi> there
is, very obvious to every under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
(which because I shall
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98327:39"/>
have fit occasion a little after to
declare, I will not now any
longer insist upon,) taken from
the nature of <hi>the Iurisdiction</hi> of
<hi>these Courts</hi> so far distant from
<hi>the Iurisdiction</hi> appertaining to
<hi>those other Courts,</hi> that these are
notoriously separated and in
Common and vulgar speach di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
from all other by the
peculiar name and appellation of
<hi>the Spiritual Courts.</hi> But <hi>another
Argument,</hi> which those books
have suggested, I am the more
willing here to produce, for that
it not only sufficiently <hi>proveth</hi>
the matter now in hand, but is
also very needful to be better
known abroad in the world then
it is, for the removing of a very
<hi>unjust censure,</hi> which meerly for
want of the knowledge of <hi>the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98327:39"/>
true cause,</hi> hath been laid upon
<hi>the Bishops</hi> in one particular, to
their great wrong and prejudice.
It hath been much talked on, not
only by <hi>the Common sort</hi> of people,
but by some persons also of <hi>better
rank</hi> and understanding, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to <hi>the Bishops</hi> as an act of
very high insolency, that in their
<hi>Processes, Patents, Commissions,
Licences,</hi> and other <hi>Instruments</hi>
whereunto their <hi>Episcopal Seale</hi>
is affixed, so oft as they have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to mention <hi>themselves,</hi> the
Style runneth ever more <hi>in the Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
number [Nos G. Cantuar-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiepiscopus,
Coram nobis, Salvo
nobis—&amp;c.</hi>] just as it doth in his
Majesties <hi>Letters Patents</hi> and
<hi>Commissions:</hi> thereby shewing
themselves (say they) as if they
were his <hi>Fellows</hi> and <hi>Equals.</hi> All
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98327:40"/>
this great noise and clamour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>the pride of the Bishops</hi> upon
this score, proceedeth (as I said)
meerly from the ignorance of the
true <hi>original cause and ground</hi> of
that innocent and ancient <hi>usage;</hi>
and therefore cannot signify much
to any reasonable and considering
man, when that <hi>ground</hi> is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered:
which is this, <hi>viz.</hi> that
every <hi>Bishop</hi> is in construction of
our Laws <hi>a Corporation.</hi> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<hi>the Bishop</hi> of himselfe and
in his private and <hi>personal capacity</hi>
be but <hi>a single person</hi> as other men
are, and accordingly in his <hi>letters</hi>
concerning his own particular
affairs, and in all other his <hi>actings</hi>
upon his own occasions and as <hi>a
private person</hi> writeth of himselfe
in <hi>the singular number,</hi> as other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
men do; yet for as much as
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98327:40"/>
in his publike <hi>and politick capacity,</hi>
and <hi>as a Bishop</hi> in the Church of
England, he standeth in the eye
of the Law <hi>as a Corporation;</hi> the
King not only alloweth him act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>that capacity,</hi> to write of
himselfe in <hi>the plural number,</hi> but
in all writs directed to him <hi>as
Bishop</hi> (as in <hi>Presentations,</hi> and the
like) bespeaketh him in <hi>the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
number [Vestrae Diocesis, vobis
praesentamus &amp;c.] The Bishop</hi> then
being a <hi>Corporation,</hi> and that by
<hi>the Kings</hi> authority, as all other
<hi>Corporations</hi> (whether <hi>Simple</hi> or <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate,</hi>
whether by <hi>Charter</hi> or <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription</hi>)
are: it is meet he should
hold his <hi>Courts,</hi> and proceed
therein in the same manner and
form (where there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
reason to the contrary) as
other <hi>Corporations</hi> do. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98327:41"/>
as it would be a high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
for the <hi>Chancellour and
Scholars</hi> of one of the Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
being <hi>a Corporation,</hi> to
whom the King by his Charter
hath granted <hi>a Court,</hi> or for <hi>the
Major and Aldermen</hi> of a City for
the same reason, to issue <hi>Writs</hi> or
do other <hi>acts</hi> in their Courts <hi>in
the Kings name,</hi> not having any
authority from <hi>the King</hi> or his
grant, or from <hi>the Laws and
Customs</hi> of England so to do: so
doubtless it would for the same
reason be esteemed a presumption
no less intolerable for <hi>the Bishops</hi>
to use <hi>the Kings name</hi> in their
<hi>processes</hi> and <hi>judicial acts,</hi> not
having any sufficient <hi>legal war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi>
or authority for so doing.</p>
               <p>IX. Which if it were duly
considered, would induce any
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98327:41"/>
reasonable man to beleive and
confesse that this manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<hi>in their own names</hi> used
by <hi>the Bishops</hi> in their <hi>Courts,</hi> is
so far from trenching upon <hi>the
Regal power</hi> and authority, which
is the crime charged upon it by
<hi>the Objectors,</hi> that the contrary
usage (unless it were enjoyned
by some <hi>Law</hi> of the Land, as it
was in the Raign of <hi>King Edward
the Sixth</hi>) might far more justly be
charged therewithal. For the
true reason of using <hi>the Kings
name</hi> in any <hi>Court,</hi> is not thereby
to acknowledge the emanation
of <hi>the power</hi> or jurisdiction of that
<hi>Court</hi> from, or the subordination
of that <hi>power</hi> unto, <hi>the Kings</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
or authority, as <hi>the Objectors</hi>
seeme to suppose; but rather to
shew the same <hi>Court</hi> to be one of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98327:42"/>
                  <hi>the Kings own immediate Courts,</hi>
wherein <hi>the King</hi> himselfe is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
(in the construction of <hi>the
Law</hi>) either by his <hi>personal</hi> or
<hi>virtual power</hi> to be present. And
the not using of <hi>the Kings name</hi> in
other <hi>Courts,</hi> doth not infer, as if
<hi>the Iudges</hi> of the said <hi>Courts</hi> did
not act by <hi>the Kings</hi> authority,
(for who can imagine that they
who <hi>hold a Court</hi> by virtue of <hi>the
Kings grant</hi> only, should pretend
to <hi>act</hi> by any other then <hi>his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority?</hi>)
but only that they are
no <hi>immediate representatives</hi> of the
Kings person in such their <hi>juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi>
nor have consequently
any allowance from him to use
<hi>his name</hi> in the exercise or execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof.</p>
               <p>X. <hi>Secondly,</hi> there is another
observable difference in this
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98327:42"/>
point, between <hi>the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-law-Courts,</hi>
such as are most
of those afore-mentioned, and
those <hi>Courts</hi> that proceed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the way of <hi>the Civil Law.</hi>
If <hi>the King</hi> appoint a <hi>Constable,</hi> or
<hi>Earle-Marshal,</hi> or <hi>Admiral</hi> of
England: for as much as all try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
in <hi>the Marshals Court</hi> (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called <hi>the Court of Honour</hi>)
and in <hi>the Admiralty</hi> are according
to <hi>the Civil Law;</hi> all <hi>Processes</hi>
therefore, <hi>Sentences,</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> in
those Courts go in the names of
<hi>the Constable, Earle-Marshal,</hi> or <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral,</hi>
and not in <hi>the Kings</hi> name.
Which manner of proceeding
constantly used in <hi>those Courts,</hi>
sith no man hitherto hath been
found to interpret, as any diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at all or dis-acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>the Kings Soveraignty</hi> over
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98327:43"/>
the said <hi>Courts:</hi> it were not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
the same manner of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in the <hi>Ecclesiastical Courts</hi>
should be so confidently charged
with so heinous a crime, did not
the intervention of some <hi>wicked
lust</hi> or other prevail with men of
<hi>corrupt minds</hi> to become <hi>partial
judges of evil thoughts.</hi> Especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
considering that</p>
               <p>XI. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> there is yet a more
special and peculiar reason to be
given in the behalf of <hi>the Bishops</hi>
for not using <hi>the Kings name</hi> in
their Processes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Courts,</hi> then can be given
for <hi>the Iudges</hi> of any other the
above-mentioned <hi>Courts</hi> (either
of <hi>the Common</hi> or <hi>Civil Laws</hi>) in
the said respect; arising (as hath
been already in part touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
from <hi>the different nature</hi> of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98327:43"/>
their several respective <hi>Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
Which is, that the summons
and other proceedings and acts in
the <hi>Ecclesiastical Courts</hi> are for the
most part in order to <hi>the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
censures</hi> and sentences of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,
&amp;c.</hi> The passing
of which <hi>sentences</hi> and other of
like kind, being a part of <hi>the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of the Keyes</hi> which our Lord
<hi>Iesus Christ</hi> thought fit to leave in
the hands of <hi>his Apostles</hi> and their
<hi>Successors,</hi> and not in the hands of
<hi>Lay-men; the Kings of England</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
challenged to belong unto
themselves: but left the exercise
of that <hi>Power</hi> entirely to the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi>
as the lawful <hi>Successors</hi> of
<hi>the Apostles,</hi> and inheritours of
their <hi>Power.</hi> The regulating and
ordering of that <hi>power</hi> in sundry
<hi>circumstances</hi> concerning <hi>the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98327:44"/>
exercise</hi> thereof <hi>in foro exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi>
the godly <hi>Kings of England</hi>
have thought to belong unto
them as <hi>in the right of their Crown;</hi>
and have accordingly <hi>made Laws</hi>
concerning the same, even as they
have done also concerning other
matters appertaining to <hi>Religion</hi>
and <hi>the worship of God.</hi> But the
<hi>substance</hi> of that power, and the
<hi>function</hi> thereof, as they saw it to
be altogether improper to their
office and calling: so they never
pretended or laid <hi>claim</hi> thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
But on the contrary when by
occasion of the title of <hi>Supream
Head, &amp;c.</hi> assumed by <hi>King Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the Eighth,</hi> they were charged by
<hi>the Papists</hi> for challenging to
themselves such <hi>power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
spiritual;</hi> they constantly and
openly <hi>disavowed</hi> it to the whole
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98327:44"/>
world, <hi>renouncing</hi> all claim to any
such <hi>power or authority:</hi> As is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest;
not onely from the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>writings</hi> of many godly <hi>Bishops,</hi>
eminent for their learning in their
several respective times, in vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of <hi>the Church of England</hi>
from that calumny of the Papists;
as Archbishop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> Bishop
<hi>Bilson,</hi> Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> Bishop
<hi>Carleton,</hi> and others: but also by
the <hi>Injunctions</hi> of Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,
and the <hi>admonition</hi> prefixed
thereunto; by <hi>the 37<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Art.</hi> of the
Church of England required to be
<hi>subscribed</hi> by all that take <hi>Orders</hi> in
the Church, or <hi>Degrees</hi> in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversities;
and by constant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<hi>judgement</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> of
the two late <hi>Kings</hi> of blessed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
<hi>King Iames</hi> and <hi>King
Charles the I<hi rend="sup">st.</hi>
                  </hi> They who thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98327:45"/>
                  <hi>disclaimed</hi> the medling with
<hi>Spiritual Censures</hi> and <hi>the power
of the keyes,</hi> cannot be rationally
supposed to have thought their
own <hi>presence</hi> (either <hi>personal</hi> or
<hi>virtual</hi>) any way requisite in <hi>the
Courts</hi> where such <hi>Censures</hi> were
to be pronounced, and that <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi>
to be administred and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised:
and therefore doubtless
could not deem it fit or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
that in the <hi>juridical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings</hi>
of such <hi>Courts</hi> their names
should be used.</p>
               <p>XII. The <hi>second point</hi> in the
charge objected is, that this
custome used by <hi>the Bishops</hi> in
acting all things in <hi>the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Courts in their own names</hi> grew
at first from the exorbitant power
of <hi>the Popes,</hi> who laboured what
they could to advance their own
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98327:45"/>
greatness by <hi>exempting the Clergy</hi>
from all subjection to <hi>Temporal
Princes,</hi> and setting up an <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
power</hi> of Jurisdiction inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
upon <hi>the Secular:</hi> and
that <hi>the Parliament</hi> had that sence
of it in the Raign of <hi>King Edward
the Sixth,</hi> as the words of <hi>the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi>
made <hi>I. Edward VI.</hi> for the
altering of the said <hi>Custome,</hi> do
plainly intimate.</p>
               <p>XIII. In which part of <hi>the
Charge</hi> there is at the most but
thus much of Truth. 1. That <hi>the
Bishops of Rome</hi> did not omit with
all sedulity to pursue the grand
design of that <hi>See,</hi> which was to
bring all <hi>Christian Princes</hi> into
subjection to it self. 2. That all
the labouring for <hi>the Exemption of
the Clergy</hi> from the Secular Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,
was in order to that design.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98327:46"/>
3. That <hi>the Bishops</hi> manner of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<hi>their own names</hi> in all acts of
their <hi>Iurisdiction,</hi> (looked upon
alone and <hi>by it self</hi> without any
consideration of <hi>the true reasons</hi>
thereof) doth carry, by so much
the more, shew of serving <hi>the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Interest,</hi> then if they should
do all <hi>in the King's Name,</hi> by how
much the acknowledging the
Kings <hi>Supremacy-Ecclesiastical</hi> is
less apparent therein, then in the
other. 4. That the want of such
an express acknowledgement of
<hi>the King's Supremacy,</hi> together with
the jealousies <hi>the State</hi> had in
those times over any thing that
might seem to further or favour
the <hi>usurped Power of the Pope</hi> in
the least degree; might very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
in this particular (as well
as it did in some other things) oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98327:46"/>
such men as bear the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
sway in managing the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
affairs in the beginning of that
godly (but young) <hi>King</hi>'s Raign,
out of a just detestation of <hi>the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi>
to endeavour overhastily the
abolishing of whatsoever was
with any colour <hi>suggested</hi> unto
them to savour of <hi>Popery,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
such due examination of <hi>the</hi>
grounds of those Suggestions as
was requisite in a matter of so
great importance.</p>
               <p>XIIII. This is all we <hi>can</hi> (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
more then we <hi>need</hi>) yield
unto in this point of <hi>the Charge.</hi>
But then there are some other
things which we cannot easily
assent unto: as <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. That <hi>this custome had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
its original and growth
from the Popes usurped power.</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:98327:47"/>
Which as we think it impossible
for them to prove; so it seemeth
to us the less probable, because
by comparing of this course used
in <hi>the Ecclesiastical Courts</hi> with the
practise of sundry <hi>other Courts,</hi>
some of like, some of different
nature thereunto, we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
shewed the true reasons and
grounds of <hi>the difference</hi> between
some <hi>Courts</hi> and othersome in
this particular.</p>
               <p>2. That it is <hi>a rag or relique of
Antichristian tyranny.</hi> Which we
believe to be altogether untrue.
Not only for the reasons before
specified, and for that the same
is done in sundry <hi>other Courts,</hi>
holden within this Realm without
any note of <hi>Antichristianisme</hi> or
<hi>Popery</hi> fastened thereupon: but
also because it hath been constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98327:47"/>
continued in <hi>this Kingdome</hi> (the
short Raign of <hi>King Edward the
Sixth</hi> only excepted) with the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
of all <hi>the Protestants Kings
and Queens</hi> of this Realm ever
since the Reformation. Who,
although they be ever and anon
taxed by <hi>the Puritane-faction</hi> (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
and insolently enough) for
want <hi>of a Through-Reformation,</hi> and
leaving so much <hi>Popish trash</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purged
in the point of <hi>worship</hi>
and <hi>Ceremonies:</hi> yet have not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
been blamed by that party
for being wanting to themselves
in vindicating to the uttermost
their <hi>Regal</hi> authority and <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
Ecclesiastical</hi> from the usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
power of <hi>the Bishops of Rome</hi>
in any thing wherein they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it to be many wise or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
concerned. As also because
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98327:48"/>
this manner of proceeding in <hi>the
Courts Ecclesiastical</hi> hath been
constantly and without scruple of
<hi>Conscience</hi> or suspition of <hi>Popery</hi>
used and practised by all our god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and Orthodoxe <hi>Bishops;</hi> even
those, who have been the most
zealous maintainers of <hi>our Religion</hi>
against <hi>the Papists,</hi> and such as
have particularly written against
the <hi>Antichristian tyranny</hi> of the
Pope, or in defence of <hi>the Kings
Supremacy</hi> in matters Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;
as <hi>Iewel, Bilson, Abbots,
Buckridge, Carleton,</hi> and many
others.</p>
               <p>XV. But against all this that
hath been said, how agreeable so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it may seem to <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
may be opposed the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the whole Realm in
<hi>Parliament (the Bishops</hi> themselves
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98327:48"/>
also then sitting and voting as
well as other the <hi>Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>)
in the first year of the Raign
of <hi>King Edward the Sixth,</hi> who
thought fit by their <hi>Act</hi> to alter
the aforesaid <hi>form,</hi> and that
upon <hi>the two</hi> aforesaid <hi>grounds,
viz.</hi> that it was contrary to the
form and order of <hi>the Common
Law-Courts,</hi> and according to the
form and manner used in the
time of <hi>the usurped power of the
Bishop of Rome.</hi> Which being
the last and weightiest point in
<hi>the Charge,</hi> is the more consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
in that besides its own
strength, it giveth also farther
strength and confirmation to the
other two.</p>
               <p>XVI. But for answer unto this
<hi>argument</hi> drawn from the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98327:49"/>
in the Statute of <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Edw. 6.</hi>
I would demand of the <hi>Objectors,</hi>
where they place the chief strength
of the <hi>Argument:</hi> whether in the
authority of <hi>the persons (viz.</hi>
the great <hi>Assembly of State</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened
in <hi>Parliament</hi> so judging;
or in validity of those <hi>reasons,</hi>
which led them so to judge. If
in this later, their <hi>judgment</hi> can
weigh no more, then <hi>the reasons</hi>
do whereon it is built; the frailty
whereof we have already examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and discovered. If in <hi>the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
of the Judges; we lay
in the ballance against it the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Kingdome in <hi>all the
Parliaments</hi> after the decease of
<hi>King Edward</hi> for above fourscore
years together: the first whereof
<hi>repeated that Statute;</hi> and none of
those that followed (for ought ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98327:49"/>
to us) ever went about
to <hi>revive</hi> it.</p>
               <p>XVII. If it shall be said <hi>first,</hi>
That the enacting of <hi>that Statute</hi>
by King <hi>Edward</hi> was done in order
to the farther abolishing of <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and the perfecting of <hi>the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi>
begun by his <hi>Father:</hi> I
answer, that as it was a very pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
care, and of singular example
in so <hi>young a Prince,</hi> to intend and
endeavour <hi>the reformation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
and <hi>the Church</hi> within his
Realms (for which even at this
day we have cause to acknowledge
the good providence of <hi>Almighty
God</hi> in raising him up to become
so blessed an instrument of his <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
and our <hi>good:</hi>) so on the other
side we cannot doubt but that the
business of <hi>Reformation</hi> under him
was carried on with such mixture
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98327:50"/>
of <hi>private ends</hi> and other human
<hi>frailties</hi> and affections, as are usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
incident into the enterprising
of <hi>great affairs,</hi> especially such as
cannot be effected without the
assistance of <hi>many Instruments.</hi> All
of which in likelyhood being not
of one <hi>judgement</hi> and <hi>temper,</hi> but
having their several <hi>inclinations,
passions</hi> and <hi>interests</hi> with great
difference; the <hi>product</hi> of their
endeavours (whatsoever sincerity
there were in the <hi>intentions</hi> of the
first mover) must needs be such,
as the constitution of <hi>the most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
instruments</hi> employed in the
work would permit it to be.
The very name of <hi>Reformation of
Religion and manners,</hi> and of abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
crept into the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,</hi>
carrieth with it a great
deal of outward glory and lustre,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98327:50"/>
filling the hearts of men with <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations</hi>
of much happiness to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue,
and in that <hi>hope</hi> is evermore
entertained with general applause,
especially of <hi>the vulgar sort:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
men look upon it as it were
in <hi>the Idea,</hi> (that is to say, as it
is <hi>fancied</hi> and <hi>devised</hi> in the mind
and imagination) and abstracted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from those <hi>impediments</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences,</hi>
which when they
come <hi>ad practicandum</hi> and to put
their thoughts in execution, they
shall be sure to meet withal more
or less, to render <hi>the performance</hi>
short of <hi>the promise</hi> and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>XVIII. Now because <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
is so much talked of in these
evil dayes of ours, wherein thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of <hi>well-meaning people</hi> have
been seduced into <hi>dangerous by-paths</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:98327:51"/>
by that <hi>specious Name:</hi> it
will not be amiss, (though we
may seem perhaps to digress a
little for it) to prompt <hi>the Reader</hi>
to some <hi>considerations,</hi> that may
incline him rather to <hi>suspect</hi> a
thing to be <hi>ill done,</hi> then to be
<hi>confident</hi> that it is <hi>well done,</hi> if he
have no other <hi>reason</hi> of that <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
but this, that it is pretended
to be done by way of <hi>Reformation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIX. It is considerable <hi>first,</hi>
that <hi>Reformation</hi> is the usual vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
wherewith men of insati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<hi>avarice</hi> or <hi>ambition</hi> disguise
their base unworthy <hi>intentions,</hi>
that the ugliness thereof may not
appear to vulgar eyes. Seldome
hath any <hi>Sacrilegious</hi> or <hi>Seditious</hi>
attempt appeared abroad in the
world, and been countenanced
either by <hi>the Great ones</hi> or the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:98327:51"/>
which hath not been ushered
in by this piece of <hi>Hypocrisie.</hi> Not
to look further (backward or
forward) for instances in both
kindes, then to the Raign of that
<hi>King</hi> wherein <hi>the Statute</hi> so much
insisted upon was made; It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denied, but that during the
Raign of that religious and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
young <hi>King</hi> (without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
as we verily hope and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
or at most through the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious
suggestions and cunning
insinuations of some that were
about him) such <hi>Sacriledges</hi> were
acted, and that under the name
&amp; pretence of <hi>Reformation,</hi> as have
cast a very foul blemish upon our
very <hi>Religion,</hi> especially in the
eyes of our <hi>Adversaries,</hi> who have
ever shewed themselves forward
enough to impute the faults of <hi>the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98327:52"/>
persons</hi> to <hi>the Profession.</hi> And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the same pretence of <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
were also masked all the <hi>blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
mischiefs</hi> and <hi>outrages</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by <hi>Kett</hi> and his seditious
rabble in the same <hi>Kings</hi> Raign:
insomuch as <hi>a great Oak</hi> whereat
they appointed their usual <hi>meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
and whereon (by the just
judgement of God) himself the
ringleader of that rebellion was
afterwards <hi>hanged,</hi> was by them
called <hi>the Oak of Reformation.</hi> By
what was done <hi>in those times,</hi> (ill
enough indeed, yet modestly in
comparison of what hath been
done <hi>in ours</hi>) we may have a near
guess what their meaning is, that
are so eagerly set upon <hi>a Thorow-Reformation</hi>
(as they call it) in
<hi>the Church,</hi> in <hi>the Commonwealth,</hi>
in <hi>the Vniversities:</hi> even to get
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98327:52"/>
into their own <hi>hands</hi> and <hi>disposal</hi>
all the Haces and Offices of <hi>power</hi>
or <hi>profit</hi> in them all. I dare not
say, (for truly of some I <hi>believe</hi>
the contrary, and <hi>hope</hi> the same
of many more) that all those that
joyn in <hi>vote</hi> or act with those plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
pretenders of <hi>Reformation,</hi> or
<hi>wish well</hi> unto them in the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of their hearts, are guilty of
their abominable <hi>hypocrisie.</hi> But
sure all experience sheweth, that
in <hi>great Councels</hi> there are ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
some one or a few <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>active</hi> and <hi>cunning</hi> men that are
able by the reputation of their
<hi>wisdome</hi> and abilities of <hi>speech</hi> to
carry all businesses in <hi>the vogue</hi>
even as themselves have before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
closely contrived them:
leading on the rest, as <hi>a bell-wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
doth the whole <hi>flock,</hi> or as a
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98327:53"/>
crafty <hi>fore-man of a Iury</hi> doth the
whole <hi>dozen,</hi> which way soever
they please; who follow tamely
after (<hi>quâ itur, non quâ eundum</hi>)
in <hi>an implicit belief,</hi> that that must
needs be <hi>the right way,</hi> which they
see <hi>such skilful guides</hi> to have taken
before them.</p>
               <p>XX. But say there were no such
reserved secret <hi>sinister ends</hi> either in
<hi>the chief Agents</hi> or their <hi>Ministers,</hi>
but that <hi>a just Reformation</hi> were
as really and sincerely <hi>intended</hi> by
them all, as it is by some of them
speciously <hi>pretended:</hi> yet is it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
<hi>Secondly,</hi> how very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
a thing it is, in the business
of <hi>Reformation</hi> to stay at the right
point, and not to <hi>overdo,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
whereby we are very apt in decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>one of the extreams</hi> to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98327:53"/>
                  <hi>the other,</hi> either in point of <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion</hi>
or <hi>practice.</hi> In detestation
of the heresie of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> who
distinguished the <hi>persons</hi> in Christ,
because he knew there were <hi>two
natures; Eutyches</hi> went so far as
to <hi>confound the natures,</hi> because he
knew there was but <hi>one person.</hi>
And because <hi>the Papists</hi> by the
multitude and pompousness of
their <hi>Ceremonies</hi> had taken away
much of <hi>the inward vigour</hi> of Gods
<hi>publick worship,</hi> by drawing it too
much <hi>outward; the Puritanes</hi> in
opposition to them, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
that errour, by stripping it
of all <hi>Ceremonies</hi> have left it so
<hi>bare,</hi> that (besides the unseemli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness)
it is well nigh starved for
want of convenient clothing. It
is in the distempers of <hi>the body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick</hi>
in this respect not much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98327:54"/>
then it is in those of <hi>the
body natural.</hi> In an <hi>Ague,</hi> when
<hi>the cold sit</hi> hath had his course, the
body doth not thence return to a
<hi>kindly natural warmth,</hi> but fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
speedily into a <hi>burning preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
heat,</hi> nothing less (if not
rather more) afflictive then the
former. And how osten have
<hi>Physicians,</hi> (not the unlearned
<hi>Empericks</hi> onely, but even those
best renowned for their <hi>skill</hi> and
<hi>judgement,</hi>) by tampering with
a <hi>crazy body</hi> to master the predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minancy
of some <hi>noxious humour</hi>
therein, cast their patients ere
they were aware under the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of another and <hi>contrary humour</hi>
as perillous as the former: or for
fear of leaving too much <hi>bad
blood</hi> in the veins, have letten out
too much of <hi>the vital spirits</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all?
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98327:54"/>
Onely the difference is, that
in <hi>bodily diseases</hi> this course may
be sometimes profitably experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
and with good success;
not onely out of <hi>necessity,</hi> when
there is no other way of cure left,
(as they use to say, <hi>Desperate dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
must have desperate remedies:</hi>)
but also <hi>out of choice,</hi> and in a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
way; as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
in the case of some <hi>cold disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
to cast the patient into a <hi>burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
feaver,</hi> which he calleth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
And I remember to have read
somewhere to that purpose such
an Aphorisme as this, <hi>Vtile est in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasci
sebrem in spasmo.</hi> But for the
remedying of <hi>Moral</hi> or <hi>Politick</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers,
it is neither <hi>warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
nor <hi>safe</hi> to try such experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
Not <hi>warrantable;</hi> because
we have no such <hi>rule</hi> given us in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98327:55"/>
the Word of God whereby to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate:
nor <hi>safe;</hi> because herein
<hi>the Mean</hi> onely is commendable,
all <hi>Extreams</hi> (whether in <hi>defect</hi> or
<hi>excess</hi>) vitious. Now what <hi>defects</hi>
or <hi>excesses</hi> there might be in <hi>the
Reformation of Religion</hi> and <hi>the
Church</hi> within these Realms during
the Raigns of K. <hi>Henry the Eighth,
King Edward the Sixth, and Queen
Elizabeth;</hi> it doth not become
me, neither is it needful, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.
But sure it is, they that
had the managery of those affairs
in their several respective times
were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, made of <hi>the
same day</hi> with other men, subject
to <hi>infirmities</hi> and <hi>passions,</hi> and to
be byassed with <hi>partial affections,</hi>
and those <hi>affections</hi> capable to be
<hi>enflamed</hi> with zeal, <hi>cooled</hi> with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes,
<hi>enraged</hi> by opposition, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98327:55"/>
                  <hi>allayed</hi> by seasonable applications.
And therefore although we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
say for certain with what <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi>
those <hi>Reformers</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of <hi>King Edward</hi>'s Raign
were steered in the whole busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
yet it is very possible, and
in this particular of <hi>the Statutes,</hi>
(from the weakness of the <hi>reasons</hi>
therein expressed) not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that the jealousies they had
of <hi>the Papal power</hi> so lately eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
might make them <hi>more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
cautelous</hi> and sollicitous to
secure themselves thereagainst,
then need required. Verily the
temper of <hi>those times</hi> and men, and
<hi>the Reformation</hi> made about those
times <hi>in other countreys</hi> considered;
we have far greater cause to bless
God that in their then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
in very many things they did
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98327:56"/>
not a <hi>great deal worse,</hi> then to
blame them that in some few
things they did not <hi>a little better,</hi>
then they have done.</p>
               <p>XXI. It is further conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> that where <hi>a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi>
is truly <hi>intended,</hi> and
the thing it self intended by that
<hi>Reformation</hi> to be established is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
within a tolerable compass of
<hi>Mediocrity;</hi> there may yet be such
errour in the choice of <hi>the means</hi>
to be used for the accomplishing
of those <hi>intentions,</hi> as may vitiate
<hi>the whole work,</hi> and render it
blame-worthy. For although it
be a truth so expresly affirmed by
<hi>the Apostle,</hi> and so agreeable to
the dictates of right reason <hi>[That
we may not do any evil thing for any
good end]</hi> as that I should scarce
have believed it possible that any
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98327:56"/>
man that pretended to be <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
or but <hi>reasonable</hi> should hold
the contrary, had I not been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised
by very credible persons
that some men of eminent <hi>place
and power</hi> did so, by <hi>distinguishing</hi>
(but beside the book, and <hi>where
the Law distinguisheth not</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>a publick</hi> and <hi>a private good
end:</hi> yet the <hi>eagerness</hi> of most men
in the pursuance of such <hi>ends</hi> as
they are fully bent upon, and their
<hi>pride</hi> of spirit disdaining to be
crossed in their <hi>purposes,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
of meeting with any <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition;</hi>
putteth them many times
upon the use of <hi>such means</hi> as seem
for the present best conducing to
<hi>the ends</hi> they have proposed to
themselves, without any sufficient
care to examine whether such
<hi>means</hi> be <hi>lawful</hi> or not. For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98327:57"/>
they run on <hi>headlong</hi> and are
resolved not to stick at any <hi>nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of conscience,</hi> but being inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in a <hi>design</hi> to go through with
it <hi>per fas &amp; nefas;</hi> measuring <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty</hi>
by <hi>utility:</hi> or els they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
up any thin <hi>fig-leaves</hi> where
they can meet with them to hide
<hi>the deformity</hi> of their actions if it
were possible even from their own
eyes; and are willing their <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
should bribe and cheat their
<hi>judgements</hi> with any weak <hi>reasons</hi>
to pronounce that <hi>lawful</hi> to be
done which they have a mind to
do, the secret <hi>checks</hi> and <hi>murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings</hi>
of their <hi>consciences</hi> to the
contrary notwithstanding. Hence
it is, that whereas men ought to
conform all their <hi>wills</hi> and <hi>actions</hi>
to the <hi>exact rule</hi> of Gods Word,
they do so often in stead thereof
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98327:57"/>
crooken <hi>the rule</hi> to make it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with their <hi>actions</hi> and <hi>desires:</hi>
raising such <hi>doctrines</hi> and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
from the sacred <hi>Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi>
by forced inferences, as will
best serve to give countenance to
whatsoever they fancie to be, or
please to call <hi>Reformation;</hi> and to
whatsoever <hi>means</hi> they should use
for the effecting of such <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
though it were by popular
<hi>tumults,</hi> civil <hi>war,</hi> despising <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,</hi>
breaking <hi>Oaths,</hi> open
<hi>Rebellion,</hi> or any other act how
<hi>unjust</hi> soever and full of <hi>disloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
Which made Learned <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi>
observing in his time how <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptists</hi>
and all sorts of <hi>Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
that attempted to bring in
any new and unheard of alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in <hi>Religion</hi> into the Churches
of Christ, by any means though
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98327:58"/>
never so seditious and unlawful,
did yet justifie all their enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
by this, that they were done
in order to a more <hi>perfect Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi>
to cry out, <hi>Ego non intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
istam Reformatorum mundi <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiam.</hi>
Whether this observation
be so sitly applyable to those
times of <hi>King Edwards Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
as the two former considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were, I know not: I am
sure it sitteth but too well to
these evil times of ours, wherein
the pretence of a <hi>Thorow-Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi>
serveth as <hi>a foile</hi> to set off
<hi>the blackest crimes</hi> that ever the
Christian world was guilty of.</p>
               <p>XXII. <hi>Lastly,</hi> say there should
be nothing amiss in any of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses,
but that <hi>the intentions</hi> were
sincere, <hi>the proceedings</hi> moderate,
and <hi>the means</hi> lawful: yet since
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98327:58"/>
no wit of man is at the present
able to foresee all <hi>the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
that may ensue upon any great
and suddain change of such <hi>Lawes</hi>
and <hi>Customes</hi> as have been long
and generally observed, till <hi>time</hi>
and <hi>experience</hi> discover them; it
may very well (and not seldome
doth) come to pass, that <hi>the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi>
intended for the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying
of some one <hi>abuse,</hi> or the
preventing of some present appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<hi>inconvenience,</hi> may open a
gap to let in some other <hi>abuses</hi> or
<hi>inconveniences,</hi> which (though
yet <hi>undiscerned</hi>) may in time prove
to be <hi>more</hi> and <hi>greater,</hi> then those
that were sought to be remedyed.
Physicians tell us that all <hi>sudden
changes</hi> in the body are <hi>dangerous:</hi>
and it is no otherwise in <hi>the Church</hi>
and <hi>State.</hi> Which is the ground
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98327:59"/>
of that <hi>Maxime,</hi> well approved of
all wise men, if rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
<hi>Malum benè positum non mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendum:</hi>
and of that other, so
famous in the Ancient Councels,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Let the old Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes
be observed.</hi> And therefore
<hi>Aristotle</hi> gravely censureth that
<hi>Law</hi> made by <hi>Hippodamus</hi> the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesian
Law-giver, <hi>That whosoever
should devise any new Law for the
common good should be rewarded by
the State,</hi> as a Law indeed foolish
and pernicious, how specious and
plausible soever it seemed at the
first appearance: because (saith
he) it would but encourage busie
&amp; active spirits to be alwayes <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating</hi>
some thing or other in <hi>the
State,</hi> which might finally tend
to the subversion of all ancient
<hi>Lawes and Customes,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98327:59"/>
of the <hi>whole Government</hi> it
self. Now that <hi>the Reformation</hi>
in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes, as to this
particular in <hi>that Statute</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
was subject at least to this
frailty, we may very probably
gather (<hi>a posteriori</hi>) from this;
that after it was once <hi>repealed,</hi>
they that had to do in <hi>the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
ever since, thought it sit ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to let it <hi>lye under</hi> that repeal,
then to <hi>revive</hi> it.</p>
               <p>XXIII. There can be no doubt,
but that to an <hi>objection</hi> made from
the force of <hi>a Statute,</hi> it is a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>answer</hi> (if it be true) to say
that the said <hi>Statute</hi> hath been <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed</hi>
and so continueth. Yet
the adversaries of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> are so
pertinaciously bent to hold their
<hi>Conclusion</hi> in despite of all <hi>Premis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
that they seem to be nothing
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98327:60"/>
satisfied there withal, but <hi>dividing</hi>
the answer, turn <hi>the former part</hi>
of it (<hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>the Repeal</hi>) to
their own advantage. For say
they, that <hi>Repeal</hi> being made by
Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> who was a professed
<hi>Papist,</hi> and a Persecuter of <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Religion,</hi> was certainly <hi>an
Act</hi> of hers done in favour of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery;</hi>
and so is a strong confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that <hi>the form</hi> of proceeding
formerly used by <hi>the Bishops</hi> in
<hi>the Ecclesiastical Courts,</hi> prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>the Statute of King Edward,</hi>
but restored by that her <hi>Repeal,</hi>
was a <hi>popish practice,</hi> and more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitting
<hi>Papists</hi> then <hi>Protestants</hi> to
use.</p>
               <p>XXIV. To return a full an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
hereunto; <hi>first</hi> it shall be
willingly granted, that <hi>Queen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
being a zealous <hi>Papist,</hi> did cause
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98327:60"/>
that <hi>Statute</hi> made in the first of her
<hi>Brothers</hi> Raign to be <hi>repealed</hi> out
of pure zeal to <hi>the Romish Religion,</hi>
and in favour of <hi>the Pope</hi> and of
his <hi>Iurisdiction.</hi> Both bee use she
conceived (which was true) that
her late <hi>Brother</hi> being <hi>a Protestant</hi>
had by that <hi>Statute</hi> prohibited <hi>the
Bishops</hi> to do sundry things <hi>in their
own names,</hi> of purpose thereby to
lessen <hi>the Popes authority</hi> within
his Realms: as also because their
using of <hi>the Kings name</hi> in their
<hi>Processes</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> carried with it
(as we formerly granted) a more
express and evident acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>the Kings Supremacy Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical,</hi>
then the contrary cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
doth.</p>
               <p>XXV But then <hi>secondly,</hi> this
being granted, it will by no means
follow either <hi>first,</hi> that <hi>the repeal</hi> of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98327:61"/>
that <hi>Statute</hi> is not to be valued by
any <hi>Protestant;</hi> or that <hi>secondly the
custome</hi> of <hi>the Bishops</hi> prohibited by
<hi>the Statute</hi> and restored by <hi>the Act
of Repeal</hi> was <hi>Popish;</hi> or <hi>thirdly,</hi>
that our former <hi>answer</hi> was unsuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient:
not <hi>the first,</hi> because we
are not to look upon <hi>the Statute</hi>
and upon <hi>the Act of Repeal,</hi> as they
were made, the one by <hi>a Protestant</hi>
the other by <hi>a Papist</hi> (for that
were to judge <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and with
<hi>respect of persons;</hi>) but to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whether <hi>the reasons</hi> whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>the Statute</hi> was grounded were
<hi>in veritate rei</hi> such, as that it ought
not to have been <hi>repealed</hi> either by
<hi>Papist</hi> or <hi>Protestant.</hi> Which <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
how they have been valued,
appeareth upon <hi>the post-fact</hi> in
this; that <hi>a Papist Princess</hi> by the
principles of her <hi>Religion</hi> could do
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98327:61"/>
no less then <hi>repeal that Statute,</hi> and
<hi>a Protestant Princess</hi> without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
to the principles of her <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
might continue that <hi>Repeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXVI. Not <hi>the second:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that very <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>I. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Sixth,</hi> by which it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
<hi>that all Summons, Citations
and other Processes Ecclesiastical be
made in the name and with the style
of the King,</hi> doth it self sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
absolve the contrary custome
formerly used by <hi>the Bishops</hi> act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in their own names, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either <hi>Popish</hi> or otherwise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory
to <hi>the Kings Supremacy.</hi>
Inasmuch as by <hi>Proviso</hi>'s in the
said <hi>Statute the Bishops</hi> are still per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in some cases to use <hi>their
own names</hi> without any mention
at all to be made of <hi>the King:</hi> as
namely <hi>the Archbishop of Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:98327:62"/>
to grant <hi>Faculties</hi> and <hi>Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations;</hi>
and every other <hi>Bishop</hi>
to make <hi>Collations, Presentations,
Institutions</hi> and <hi>Inductions</hi> of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
<hi>Letters</hi> of <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missories
&amp;c.</hi> under their own
names and seals, as by the words
of the said <hi>Statute</hi> doth plainly
appear. Which sure would not
have been permitted in any case,
had the thing it self been by them
conceived to have been simply
and <hi>de toto genere</hi> either <hi>Popish</hi> or
prejudicial to <hi>the Regal Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXVII. Not <hi>the Third:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they <hi>disjoynt</hi> our former
<hi>answer,</hi> that they might make
their advantage of the one piece
of it severed from the other. For
the strength of <hi>the answer</hi> (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>copulative</hi>) was not to lye in
<hi>either part</hi> alone, but in <hi>both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:98327:62"/>
taken joyntly; and indeed
more principally in <hi>the later</hi> part
which they slightly put off, then
in <hi>the former</hi> whereat they take
advantage. We do not say that
the objecting of <hi>that Statute</hi> is of
little moment against us, because
it was <hi>repealed by Queen Mary</hi>
(though that <hi>repeal</hi> alone is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to make it <hi>void</hi> and invalid
as to all <hi>effects in Law:</hi>) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
being then <hi>repealed</hi> it was
never after <hi>revived</hi> in the Raigns
either of <hi>Queen Elizabeth, King
Iames, or his Majesty that now
is:</hi> which sheweth that <hi>the
Act of Repeal</hi> (as to the point now
in dispute) was by them <hi>approved</hi>
of, and intended to <hi>continue</hi> in
force. And it will thence follow
further and most clearly, that in
the judgement of all these <hi>wise</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:98327:63"/>
and <hi>religious Princes,</hi> there was a
great difference between <hi>the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal</hi>
and <hi>the Episcopal Iurisdiction,</hi>
as they had been either of them
exercised within these Realms:
and that <hi>the Papal</hi> was prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to <hi>the Regal Power</hi> and Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
but <hi>the Episcopal</hi> was not.</p>
               <p>XXVIII. Neither doth that
suffice which is put in by way of
<hi>Reply</hi> hereunto, to alledge that
<hi>the continuance</hi> of the old custome
(after <hi>the repeal</hi> made) happened
either through <hi>inadvertency of the
State,</hi> or by reason of <hi>the great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi>
some or other of <hi>the Bishops</hi>
ever had with those <hi>Princes.</hi> For
it cannot be doubted but that <hi>the
State,</hi> having before them <hi>a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent</hi>
of so late and fresh memory
as the <hi>Statute of 1. Edw. 6.</hi> would
at some time or other within the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98327:63"/>
space of <hi>fourscore</hi> years (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
there being no want in
those dayes of enough greedy
<hi>Great-ones</hi> and factious <hi>Disciplina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
to remind them of it) have
taken a time to frame and pass <hi>a
Bill</hi> for the reviving of <hi>that Statute:</hi>
if they had deemed <hi>the custome,</hi>
therein forbidden, <hi>Popish</hi> or dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
either to <hi>the Kings honour</hi>
or <hi>power,</hi> or had not rather found
sufficient <hi>reason</hi> to perswade them
that the said <hi>Statute</hi> was <hi>inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi>
or at leastwise <hi>useless.</hi> And
as for <hi>the Bishops,</hi> they that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the condition of those
first times well know that (under
<hi>God</hi> and his good <hi>providence</hi>) they
stood in a manner by the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
and sole favour of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth.
The Papists</hi> on the one
side hated them above all other
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98327:64"/>
sorts of men, because of their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
and their <hi>abilities</hi> above all
other men to defend it. On
the other side <hi>the Puritanes</hi> who
envied their <hi>power,</hi> and some <hi>great
ones</hi> about the Court, who having
tasted the sweet of <hi>Sacriledge</hi> in
the times of <hi>the two last Kings,</hi>
thirsted after the remainder of
their <hi>Revenues,</hi> complyed either
with other, for their several respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
ends, against <hi>the Bishops.</hi>
Which being so, it had been the
foolishest thing in the world for
<hi>the Bishops,</hi> to have used that <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi>
or <hi>interest</hi> they had with <hi>the
Queen</hi> (upon whose <hi>favour</hi> or <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure</hi>
their whole livelyhood
depended) for the procuring of
her <hi>consent</hi> to any <hi>Act</hi> to be done
in favour of them, that malice it
self could with any colourable
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98327:64"/>
construction interpret either to
savour of <hi>Popery,</hi> or to trench up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>the Royal Supremacy:</hi> That
<hi>Queen</hi> having both by her <hi>suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings</hi>
before, and <hi>actions</hi> after she
came to <hi>the Crown,</hi> sufficiently
witnessed to the world her averse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
from <hi>Popery:</hi> and being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<hi>a Princess of a great Spirit,</hi> and
particularly jealous in the point of
<hi>Prerogative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXIX. Whence I think we
may (with good reason) conclude,
that <hi>the ancient custome</hi> of <hi>the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
in making <hi>Summons, &amp;c.</hi> in
their own names, after it was by
<hi>the Act of Repeal 1. Mar.</hi> restored,
was continued by <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi>
and her successours ever since
without interruption, or reviving
of <hi>the Statute</hi> of <hi>King Edward:</hi>
neither out of any <hi>inadvertency in
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98327:65"/>
the State,</hi> nor through any impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
or indirect <hi>labouring of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi>
as by <hi>the Objectors</hi> is weakly
presumed; but advisedly and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
important considerations, <hi>viz.</hi>
that the devising of such <hi>a new way,</hi>
as is set forth and appointed in
the said <hi>Statute,</hi> was not only <hi>a
needless</hi> thing, (and Laws should
not be either <hi>made,</hi> or <hi>altered,</hi> but
where it is needful so to do,) but
subject also to manifest both <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience,</hi>
and <hi>Scandal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXX. That it was altogether
<hi>needless</hi> to change <hi>the old Custome</hi>
may appear by this, that all the
imaginable <hi>necessity</hi> or <hi>utility</hi> of
such <hi>a change</hi> could be onely this:
To secure <hi>the King</hi> by using his
<hi>Name</hi> in their Processes <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as a
<hi>real acknowledgement</hi> that their <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction</hi>
is derived from him and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:98327:65"/>
no other.) that <hi>the Bishops</hi> had no
intention in the exercise of their
<hi>Episcopal power</hi> to usurp upon
his <hi>Ecclesiastical Supremacy.</hi> Which
<hi>Supremacy</hi> of the King, and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority</hi>
of his Jurisdiction &amp; Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over that which <hi>the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
exercised, being already by
so many other wayes and means
sufficiently <hi>secured;</hi> it could argue
nothing but <hi>an impertinent jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,</hi>
to endeavour to strengthen
that <hi>security</hi> by an addition of so
poor and inconsiderable regard.</p>
               <p>XXXI. <hi>The Kings of England</hi>
are <hi>secured</hi> against all danger that
may accrue to their <hi>Regal power</hi>
from <hi>Episcopal Iurisdiction</hi> as it
hath been anciently and of later
times exercised in this Realm:
<hi>First</hi> by the extent of their <hi>Power</hi>
over the persons, and livelihoods
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98327:66"/>
of <hi>the Bishops,</hi> and over the whole
<hi>State Ecclesiastical,</hi> as in the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
right of <hi>the Crown,</hi> which how
great it was, may appear by these
three particulars.</p>
               <p>XXXII. <hi>First,</hi> the <hi>Collation</hi>
and <hi>Donation of Bishopricks</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the <hi>nomination</hi> of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to be made <hi>Bishops,</hi>
in case they did by their
<hi>Writ of Conge d'eslier</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the formality of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection</hi>
to others,<note place="margin">See Stat. 25. H. 8. 20; 1. Edw. 6. 2.</note> did alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to <hi>the Kings</hi> of this Realm,
both before and since <hi>the Conquest,</hi>
as in right of their <hi>Crown.</hi> Our
learned Lawyers assure
us,<note place="margin">Cok. 1. Instit. 2. Sect. 648.</note> that all the <hi>Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks</hi>
of this Realm are
<hi>of the Kings foundation:</hi> that they
were originally <hi>donative,</hi> and not
<hi>elective:</hi> and that the full right
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:98327:66"/>
of <hi>Investiture</hi> was in <hi>the King,</hi>
who signified his pleasure therein
<hi>per traditionem baculi &amp; annuli,</hi> by
the delivery of <hi>a ring</hi> and <hi>a Crosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-staff</hi>
to the person by him <hi>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted</hi>
and <hi>nominated</hi> for that office.
The <hi>Popes</hi> indeed often assayed
to make them <hi>elective,</hi> either by
the Dean and Canons of <hi>the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral,</hi>
or by the Monkes of some
principal <hi>Abbey</hi> adjoyning: but
<hi>the Kings</hi> still withstood it, and
maintained their <hi>right</hi> as far as
they <hi>could</hi> or <hi>durst.</hi> Insomuch as
<hi>King Henry the First</hi> being earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sollicited by <hi>the Pope</hi> to grant
<hi>the election of Bishops</hi> to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
<hi>constanter allegavit</hi> (saith the
story) and <hi>verbis minacibus,</hi> he
stoutly and with threats refused so
to do, saying he would not for
the loss of his <hi>Kingdome</hi> lose the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98327:67"/>
right of those <hi>Investitures.</hi> It is
true that <hi>King Iohn,</hi> a Prince nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fortunate nor couragious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
overpowred by <hi>the Popes,</hi> did
by <hi>Charter</hi> in the Seventeenth year
of his Raign grant that <hi>the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks</hi>
of England should be <hi>eligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
But this notwithstanding in
the Raign of <hi>King Edward the
Third,</hi> it was in open <hi>Parliament</hi>
declared and enacted, that to <hi>the
King and his heirs</hi> did belong <hi>the
collation</hi> of <hi>Archbishopricks, &amp;c.</hi>
and all other dignities that are of
his <hi>Advowson;</hi> and that <hi>the elections</hi>
granted by <hi>the Kings</hi> his progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
were under a certain form
and condition, <hi>viz.</hi> that they
should <hi>ask leave of the King</hi> to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
and that after the election
made they should <hi>obtain the Kings
consent</hi> thereunto; and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:98327:67"/>
XXXIII. <hi>Secondly, the King</hi>
hath power, if he shall see cause,
to <hi>suspend</hi> any <hi>Bishop</hi> from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of his <hi>Office</hi> for so long time
as he shall think good: yea, and
to <hi>deprive</hi> him utterly of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and office of <hi>a Bishop,</hi> if he
deserve it. Which power was <hi>de
facto</hi> exercised both by Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of their several Raigns
upon such <hi>Bishops</hi> as would not
conform to their <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXXIV. <hi>Thirdly, the Kings
of England</hi> have a great power
over <hi>the Bishops</hi> in respect of their
<hi>Temporalties,</hi> which they hold
immediately of <hi>the King per Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam;</hi>
and which every <hi>Bishop
Elect</hi> is to <hi>sue out of the Kings hands</hi>
(wherein they remained after the
decease of the former <hi>Bishop</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:98327:68"/>
                  <hi>the Vacancy,</hi>) and thence to
take his <hi>only restitution</hi> into the
same, making <hi>Oath and fealty</hi> to
the King for the same upon his
<hi>Consecration.</hi> Yea, and after such
<hi>restitution of Temporalties</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration,
the King</hi> hath power to
<hi>seize</hi> the same again into his own
hands, if he see just cause so to
do. Which <hi>the Kings of England</hi>
in former times did so frequently
practice upon any light displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
conceived against <hi>the Bishops;</hi>
that it was presented as a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
by <hi>the Arch-bishop of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
and the other Prelates by way
of request to King <hi>Edw.
3. in Parliament,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Stat. for the Clergy 14. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. 3. cap. 3.</note> and
thereupon a <hi>Statute</hi> was
made the same <hi>Parliament,</hi> that
thenceforth no <hi>Bishops Temporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
should be seized by <hi>the King</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:98327:68"/>
without good cause. I finde ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> out of <hi>the
Parliament Rolls 18. H. 3. a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,</hi>
wherein <hi>the King</hi> straightly
chargeth the <hi>Bishops</hi> not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle
in any thing <hi>to the prejudice
of his Crown;</hi> threatning them
with seisure of their <hi>Temporalties</hi>
if they should so do. The words
are, <hi>Mandatum est omnibus Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis
quae conventuri sunt apud Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestr'</hi>
(the King having before
summoned them by writ to <hi>a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
to be holden at <hi>Gloucester)
firmiter inhibendo, quod sicut Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias
suas quas de Rege tenent dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt,
nullo modo praesumant concilium
tenere de aliquibus quae ad Coronam
pertinent, vel quae personam Regis
vel Statum suum, vel Statum conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lii
sui contingunt; scituri pro certo
quod si fecerint, Rex inde capiet se
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98327:69"/>
ad Baronias suas,</hi> &amp;c. By which
<hi>Record,</hi> together with other the
premisses, it may appear, that <hi>the
Kings</hi> by their Ancient <hi>right of
Prerogative</hi> had sundry wayes po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
over <hi>the Bishops</hi> whereby to
keep them in <hi>obedience,</hi> and to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
their <hi>Supremacy</hi> from all peril
of being prejudiced by the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of <hi>Episcopal Iurisdiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXXV. Yet in order to the
utter abolishing of <hi>the Papal
usurpations</hi> and of all pretended
<hi>forraign power</hi> whatsoever in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> within these
Realms, divers <hi>Statutes</hi> have been
made in the Raign of <hi>King Henry
the Eighth</hi> and <hi>since</hi> for the further
declaring and confirming of <hi>the
Kings Supremacy Ecclesiastical.</hi>
Wherein the acknowledgement of
that <hi>Supremacy</hi> is either so expresly
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98327:69"/>
contained, or so abundantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for; as that there can be no
fear it should suffer for lack of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
acknowledgement to be made
by <hi>the Bishops</hi> in <hi>the style</hi> of their
Courts. Amongst other, <hi>First,</hi>
by <hi>Statute</hi> made <hi>25. H. 8. 19.</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the submission and petition of
<hi>the Clergy</hi> it was enacted, that no
<hi>Canons or Constitutions</hi> should be
made by <hi>the Clergy</hi> in their <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
without the <hi>Kings licence</hi>
first had in that behalfe, and his
<hi>royal assent</hi> after: and likewise
that no <hi>Canon</hi> &amp;c. should be put
in execution within the Realm
that should be contrariant or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to the <hi>Kings Prerogative
Royal, or the Customes, Lawes, or
Statutes of the Realm.</hi> Then <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
by <hi>the Statute</hi> of <hi>1. Eliz.
cap. 1.</hi> all such <hi>Ecclesiastical Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98327:70"/>
Priviledges, Superiorities
and Pre-eminences, as had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
or used, or might be lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exercised or used by any Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
power or authority was</hi> (decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be) <hi>for ever united and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to the Imperial Crown of this
Realm.</hi> And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it was also
in the same <hi>Statute</hi> provided,
that <hi>the Oath of Supremacy</hi> (wherein
there is contained as full an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of <hi>the Kings Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Suprenacy</hi> as the wit
of man can devise) should be
taken by every <hi>Archbishop and
Bishop &amp;c.</hi> which hath been ever
since duely and accordingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               <p>XXXVI. <hi>Lastly</hi> from receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any prejudice by <hi>the Bishops</hi>
and their <hi>Iurisdiction, the Regal
power</hi> is yet farther secured, by
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98327:70"/>
the subordination of <hi>the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Laws</hi> and <hi>Courts</hi> to <hi>the
Common Law</hi> of England, and to
<hi>the Kings own immediate Courts.</hi>
For although <hi>the Ecclesiastical
Laws</hi> be allowed by <hi>the Laws</hi> of
this Realm, and the proceedings
in <hi>the Ecclesiastical Courts</hi> be by
the way of <hi>the Civil</hi> and not of
<hi>the Common Law:</hi> yet are those
<hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>proceedings</hi> allowed
with this limitation and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that nothing be done <hi>against
the Common Law</hi> whereof <hi>the
Kings prerogative</hi> is a principal
part) nor against <hi>the Statutes</hi> and
<hi>Customes</hi> of the Realm. And
therefore the Law alloweth <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales</hi>
to be made from <hi>the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Courts to the King in Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery:</hi>
and in sundry cases, where
a cause dependeth before <hi>a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:98327:71"/>
Iudge,</hi> the Kings <hi>prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
lyeth to remove it into one of
his <hi>Temporal Courts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXXVII. Having so many
several ties upon <hi>the Bishops</hi> to
secure themselves and their <hi>Regal
authority</hi> from all danger that
might arise from the abuse of <hi>the
Ecclesiastical Power</hi> and <hi>Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi>
exercised by <hi>the Bishops</hi> in
their <hi>Courts</hi> (by the ancient pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
of their <hi>Crown,</hi> by the
provisions of so many <hi>Statutes
and Oaths,</hi> by the remedy of <hi>the
Common Law:) the Kings of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
had no cause to be so need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly
cautelous as to be afraid of a
meere <hi>formality, the Style of a
Court.</hi> Especially considering the
importance of <hi>the two Reasons</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in <hi>the Statute of King Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
as the onely <hi>grounds</hi> of alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98327:71"/>
that <hi>Style,</hi> not to be such as
would countervaile <hi>the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience</hi>
and <hi>Scandal</hi> that might
ensue thereupon.</p>
               <p>XXXVIII. For whereas it was
then thought convenient, <hi>to
change the Style</hi> used in <hi>the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Courts,</hi> because it was
contrary to the form used in <hi>the
Common-Law-Courts</hi> within this
Realm, (which is one of <hi>the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
in the said <hi>Statute</hi> expressed:)
it might very well upon further
consideration be afterwards
thought more convenient for the
like reason <hi>to retain</hi> the accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Style,</hi> because otherwise the
forme of <hi>the Ecclesiastical Courts</hi>
would be contrary to the form of
other <hi>Civil-Law-Courts</hi> within the
Realm (as <hi>the Admiralty,</hi> and
<hi>Earle-Marshals</hi> Court,) and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98327:72"/>
                  <hi>Courts</hi> of the Kings grant
made unto <hi>Corporations;</hi> with
either of which, <hi>the Ecclesiastical
Courts</hi> had a nearer affinity, then
with <hi>the Kings Courts of Record,</hi>
or other his own immediate
<hi>Courts of Common Law.</hi> Nor
doth there yet appear any va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
reason of difference, why
Inconformity to <hi>the Common Law-Courts</hi>
should be thought a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>ground</hi> for the altering of
the forms used in <hi>the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Courts;</hi> and yet the like
forms used in <hi>the Admiralty,</hi> in
<hi>the Earle-Marshals Court,</hi> in
<hi>Courts Baron,</hi> in <hi>Corporation-Courts
&amp;c.</hi> should (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the same inconformity)
continue as they had been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accustomed without alteration.</p>
               <p>XXXIX. If any shall alledge
as some reason of such difference,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98327:72"/>
the other <hi>Reason</hi> given in the said
<hi>Statute; viz.</hi> that the form and
manner used by <hi>the Bishops</hi> was
such as was used in the time of <hi>the
usurped power of the Bishop of Rome:</hi>
besides that therein is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
at all, (for the like forms
in those other <hi>aforesaid Courts</hi>
were also in use in the same
time;) there is further given
thereby great occasion of <hi>Scandal</hi>
to those of <hi>the Church of Rome.</hi>
And that <hi>two</hi> wayes: <hi>First,</hi> as it
is made <hi>a Reason</hi> at all; and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
as it is applyed to the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi>
now in hand. <hi>First,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<hi>the Papists</hi> unjustly charge the
<hi>Protestant Churches</hi> with <hi>Schism</hi>
for departing from their <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
it could not but be a great
<hi>Scandal</hi> to them, to confirm them
in that their uncharitable opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98327:73"/>
of us, if we should utterly
condemn any thing as <hi>unlawful,</hi>
or but even forbid the use of it as
<hi>inexpedient,</hi> upon this onely grouud
or consideration, that the same
had been used <hi>in the times of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi>
or that it had been abused by
<hi>the Papists.</hi> And truly <hi>the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes</hi>
have by this very means gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
a wonderful <hi>Scandal</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to our <hi>Adversaries,</hi> which
they ought to acknowledge and
repent of: when transported
with an indiscreet zeal they have
cryed down sundry harmeless <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies</hi>
and <hi>customes</hi> as <hi>superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Antichristian,</hi> onely for
this that <hi>Papists</hi> use them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
godly and regular <hi>Protestants</hi>
think it agreeable to <hi>Christian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
charity</hi> and <hi>prudence,</hi> that in
appointing <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> retaining
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98327:73"/>
                  <hi>ancient Customes,</hi> and the use of all
other <hi>indifferent things</hi> such course
be held, as that their <hi>moderation</hi>
might be known to all men; and
that it might appear to their very
<hi>Adversaries,</hi> that wherein they
did receed from them or any thing
practised by them, they were not
thereunto carried by <hi>a Spirit</hi> of
<hi>contradiction,</hi> but either cast upon
it by some <hi>necessity of the times,</hi> or
induced for just <hi>reasons of expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi>
so to do.</p>
               <p>XL. But then <hi>Secondly,</hi> as that
<hi>Reason</hi> relateth to the present
business in particular, <hi>the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi>
thereby given is yet greater.
For we are to know, that when
<hi>King Henry the Eighth</hi> abolished <hi>the
Papal Power,</hi> resuming in his own
hand the ancient <hi>rights of the
Crown,</hi> which <hi>the Bishops of Rome</hi>
had unjustly usurped: he took
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98327:74"/>
upon himselfe also that title
which he then found used by <hi>the
Bishops of Rome,</hi> but which none of
his Progenitors <hi>the Kings</hi> of this
Realm had ever used, of being
<hi>the Supream head of the Church</hi>
within his Dominions. This <hi>title</hi>
continued during the Reign of his
son <hi>King Edward the Sixth,</hi> by
whom <hi>the Statute</hi> aforesaid was
made, and is mentioned in that
very <hi>Statute.</hi> Now albeit by that
<hi>title</hi> or appellation was not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any other thing, then that
<hi>Supremacy Ecclesiastical</hi> which <hi>the
Kings</hi> of this Land have, and of
right ought to have, in <hi>the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi>
of their Realms over all
<hi>persons</hi> and in all <hi>causes Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
as well as other, and which is
in <hi>the Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy</hi> ackow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to belong unto them: yet
<hi>the Papists</hi> took <hi>Scandal</hi> at the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98327:74"/>
novelty thereof, and glad of such
an occasion made their advantage
of it, to bring a reproach upon
our <hi>Religion;</hi> as if <hi>the Protestants
of England</hi> were of opinion, that
all <hi>Spiritual Power</hi> did belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>the King,</hi> and that <hi>the Bishops
and Ministers</hi> of England had
their whole power of <hi>Preaching,
administring the Sacraments, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining,
Excommunicating, &amp;c.</hi>
solely and originally from <hi>the
King,</hi> as <hi>the members of the body</hi>
live by the influence which <hi>the
Head</hi> hath into them. Upon their
clamours, that title of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
head and governour</hi> was
taken into farther consideration
in the beginning of <hi>Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi>
Raign. And although that
<hi>style</hi> in the true meaning thereof
was <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>defensible</hi> enough:
yet for the avoiding of <hi>Scandal</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:98327:75"/>
and <hi>Cavil,</hi> it was judged more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
that the word <hi>Head</hi>
should thenceforth be laid aside,
and <hi>the style</hi> run only <hi>Supream
Governour;</hi> as we see it is in <hi>the
Oath of Supremacy</hi> and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
ever since, without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
the word <hi>Head;</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the intimations given in <hi>the
Queens Injunctions</hi> and elswhere
in that behalfe. And it seemeth
to me very probable, that <hi>for the
same reason</hi> especially (besides
those <hi>other reasons</hi> already given)
it was thought fitter by Her then,
and by <hi>her successours</hi> hitherto;
that <hi>the Bishops</hi> in all their <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Courts</hi> and proceedings
should act <hi>in their own names</hi> as
formerly they had done, then
that <hi>the Statute of King Edward</hi>
should be revived, for doing it <hi>in
the Kings name.</hi> For the sending
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98327:75"/>
out processes &amp;c. in order to <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication</hi>
and other Church-censures
<hi>in the Kings name,</hi> would
have served marvellously to give
<hi>colour,</hi> (and consequently <hi>strength,</hi>
in the apprehension at least of
weaker judgements) to that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny
wherewith <hi>the Papists</hi> usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
asperse our <hi>Religion,</hi> as if <hi>the
Kings of England</hi> took them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be proper and compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<hi>Iudges of Censures</hi> meerly
<hi>spiritual</hi> in their own persons, and
the <hi>Prelates</hi> accordingly did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
them so to be.</p>
               <p>Thus have I shewen to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
(I hope) of the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
and unprejudiced <hi>Reader,</hi>
that <hi>Episcopacy</hi> is no such dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
creature either in <hi>the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
or <hi>Practice,</hi> as some would make
the world believe it is: but that
<hi>the Kings Crown</hi> may stand fast e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98327:76"/>
upon his <hi>head,</hi> and flourish
in its full <hi>verdure,</hi> without pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away or displacing the least
<hi>flower</hi> in it, notwithstanding <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy</hi>
should be allowed to be
<hi>of Divine Right</hi> in the highest
sence, and <hi>the Bishops</hi> still permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to make their Processes <hi>in
their own names</hi> and not in <hi>the
Kings.</hi> By this time I doubt not,
all that are not willfully blind
(for who so blind, as he that will
not see?) do see and understand
by sad experience, that it had
been far better both with <hi>King</hi>
and <hi>Kingdome</hi> then now it is, or
(without Gods extraordinary
mercy) is like to be in haste: if
the enemies of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> had
meant no worse to <hi>the King</hi> and
his <hi>Crown,</hi> then <hi>the Bishops</hi> and
those that favoured them did.</p>

            <head>A POST-SCRIPT to the Reader.</head>
            <p>WHereas in my <hi>Answer</hi> to the former
of the two <hi>Objections</hi> in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
<hi>Treatise,</hi> I have not any
where made any clear discovery
what my own particular judgement is concerning
the <hi>Jus divinum of EPISCOPACY</hi> in the
stricter sense, either in the <hi>Affirmative</hi> or <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:</hi>
and for want of so doing, may perhaps be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
by some to have walked but <hi>haltingly,</hi> or at
least wise with more <hi>caution</hi> and <hi>mincing,</hi> then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
me to do in a business of that nature; I do
hereby declare,</p>
            <p>1. That, to avoid the starting of more <hi>Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
then needs must, I then thought it fitter (and
am of the same opinion still) to <hi>decline</hi> that Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
then to <hi>determine</hi> it either way: such <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination</hi>
being clearly of no moment at all to my
purpose, and for the solving of that <hi>Objection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That nevertheless, (leaving other men to
the <hi>liberty</hi> of their own <hi>judgements</hi>) my opinion is,
that <hi>EPISCOPAL GOVERNMENT</hi> is not to
be derived meerly from <hi>Apostolical</hi> Practise or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution:
but that it is <hi>originally</hi> founded in <hi>the
Person</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> of the Messias, our blessed Lord
<hi>JESUS CHRIST.</hi> Who being sent by his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father to be the great <hi>Apostle, [HEB. III.
1.] Bishop and Pastor [1 PET. II. 25.]</hi> of his
Church, and <hi>anointed</hi> to that Office immediately
<hi>after his Baptisme by JOHN with power and the
Holy Ghost [ACT. X. 37-8.]</hi> descending then
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:98327:77"/>
upon him <hi>in a bodily shape [LUK. III. 22.]</hi> did
afterwards before his <hi>Ascension</hi> into Heaven, <hi>send</hi>
and impower his holy <hi>Apostles,</hi> (giving them <hi>the
Holy Ghost</hi> likewise as his Father had given him)
in like manner <hi>as his Father</hi> had before <hi>sent</hi> him
<hi>[JOH. XX. 21.]</hi> to execute the same <hi>Apostolical,
Episcopal and Pastoral Office</hi> for the ordering
and governing of his <hi>Church</hi> until his coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:
and so the same <hi>Office</hi> to continue in <hi>them</hi>
and their <hi>Successours, unto the end of the world.
[MAT. XXVIII. 18—20.]</hi> This I take to be so
clear, from these and other like <hi>Texts of Scripture;</hi>
that if they shall be diligently <hi>compared</hi> together,
both <hi>between themselves,</hi> and with the following
<hi>practise of all the Churches of Christ,</hi> as well in
<hi>the Apostles</hi> times as in the Purest and Primitive
<hi>times</hi> nearest thereunto; there will be left little
cause, why any man should doubt thereof.</p>
            <p>3. That in my Answer to <hi>the later Objection</hi> I
made no use at all (nor indeed could do) of <hi>the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
of the Reverend <hi>Judges</hi> in that point, nor of
his Majesties <hi>Proclamation</hi> grounded thereupon.
For although <hi>the Proclamation</hi> had been extant
<hi>Ten years</hi> before this task was imposed upon me;
yet I had never <hi>seen,</hi> nor so much as <hi>heard</hi> of the
same in all the time <hi>before,</hi> nor yet in all the time
<hi>since;</hi> till about ten dayes ago I was advertised
thereof, when <hi>these Papers</hi> were then going to <hi>the
Press.</hi> Which, since they give so much strength to
<hi>the main Cause,</hi> and so fully avoid the <hi>Objection;</hi>
I have followed the advise of some friends, and
caused them to be printed here withal.</p>
