            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

The successe was such, as I little expected: to this day I have heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the Committee by way of answer to those doubts; but I have met with many Pamphlets, and some Sermons, tending to make the questioning of that point odious to the People, and to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracie. Among others, reading the Sermon of Mr. <hi>Richard Vines,</hi> on <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.14. before the Lord Major: and the Sermon you preached at <hi>Westminster Abbey.</hi> I perceive there is such a prejudice in you, and it may seem by the Vote pass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which I the more admire, considering the report which hath been of you, as a sober, learned, holy, well-tempered man, that you should be so transported in this matter, as to be so vehement in maintaining that which was accounted heretofore in many ages, but an Ecclesiasticall tradition, for which you are fain to fetch a command from Circumcision, and conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In all which we must affirm nothing, but what God hath taught us, and as he hath taught us.</hi> And whereas the words of <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.14. are your principall strength to prove the Covenant-holines of Infants of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving parent, <hi>Musculus</hi> a writer of good esteem, in his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary upon that place confesseth, that he had abused formerly that place against the Anabaptists, but found it impertinent to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. And for my part, after most carefull and serious reading and perusing of many Authors, and among the rest, your Sermon, I cannot yet find it to be any other then an innovation, in comparison of many other things rejected late, maintained by erroneous and dangerous principles, having no true ground from Christs institution, which alone can acquit it from Will-worship, and which hath occasioned many errors in doctrine, corruptions in discipline and manners, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary and vain disputes, and almost quite changed the ordinance of Baptisme. Wherefore, upon advise, I have resolved to examine your Sermon, who are a leading man, and in respect of your eminency, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther likely to be a very good, or very bad instrument, as you are gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And so much the rather have I pitched upon your Sermon, because I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it contains in a plain way as much as can be wel said for Poedo-baptisme; and your Epistle seems to intimate your publishing of it to be for the ease of the Assembly, and possibly it may be all I may expect from them. Now the Lord vouchsafe to frame both your spirit and mine, that we may seek and find truth, in humility and love, in this great businesse, which concerns the soules, &amp; perhaps lives and estates of many millions, yea of all godly persons; and the glory of God, and honour of our Lord Jesus Christ, and that we may tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under our feet our own credit, our own opinion, if it stand not with the honour of Christ, and the truth of God.</p>

            <p>I deny it.</p>
            <p>That which you say for the practise of baptizing infants may be reduced, 1. To the testimonies of Antiquity. 2. To the novelties and miscarriages of the opposers of it. 3. To the arguments produced for it. 4. To the answering objections against it. I shall by Gods as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence examine each of these. First you affirm, <hi>That the Christian Church hath been in possession of it for the space of fifteen hundred years and upwards, as is manifest out of most of the Records that we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> have of Antiquity both in the Greek and Latine Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I answer, that if it were true, yet it is not so much as may be said for Episcopacy, keeping of Easter, the religious use of the Crosse, &amp;c. which I conceive you reject. 2. That the highest testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies you produce come not so high. 3. Those that be alleaged, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judiciously weighed, will rather make against the present doctrine and practise, then for it. 4. There are many evidences that do as strongly prove (as proofes usually are taken in such matters) <hi>Quod ab initio non fuit sic,</hi> That from the beginning it was not so; and therefore it is but an innovation. The first of these I presume you will acknowledge, that for Antiquity not-Apostolicall, there are plain testimonies of Episcopacy, keeping of Easter, the religious use of the Crosse being in use, before any of the testimonies you, or any other can produce for baptizing of infants; and therefore I will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear mentioning proofes so obvious to Schollars.

No small evidence, that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme of Infants many hundred yeares was not ordainary in the Greeke Church: because not onely <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, though the sonne of <hi>Helena</hi> a zealous Christian as its reported, was not baptized till aged, but also that <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> who was the sonne of a Christian Bishop, and brought up long by him, was not baptized till he came to be a youth, as is related in his life. And <hi>Chrysostome</hi> though (as <hi>Grotius</hi> saith) according to the truer opinion, borne of Christian Parents, and educated by <hi>Meletius</hi> a Bishop, yet was he not baptized till past 21 yeares of age. <hi>Grotius</hi> addes, that the Canon of the Synod of <hi>Neocaesarea</hi> held in the yeare 315. determines

               </note>I Proceed to the Writers of the Latine Church, you alledge for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme of Infants. First <hi>Cyprian, one of the ancientest writers amongst the Latines:</hi> which is true; He is placed by <hi>Perkins</hi> at the yeare 240. by <hi>Vsher,</hi> at the yeare 250. Yet <hi>Tertullian</hi> was before him, and counted his master: Now in <hi>Tertullians</hi> time, <hi>it appeares</hi> (saith <hi>Grotius</hi> in Mat. 19.14.) <hi>there was nothing defined cencerning the age in which they were to be baptized, that were consecrated by their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to Christian discipline, because he disswades by so many reasons (in his book of Baptism c.</hi> 18.) <hi>the baptizing of Infants.</hi> And if he did allow it, it was only in case of necessity, as may appeare by his words in his book <hi>de anima, c.</hi> 39. But you say, <hi>Cyprian handles it at large, in Epist.</hi> 59. <hi>ad Fidum.</hi> It is true, he doth say enough in that Epistle for bapt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>zing of Infants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and more then enough, except he had spoken to better purpose. The truth is, the very reading of that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle, upon which <hi>Hierom,</hi> and especially <hi>Augustine</hi> rely for the proving of the baptizing of Infants, is sufficient to discover how great darknesse there was then upon the spirits of those that were counted the greatest lights in the Church. You say, <hi>upon this occasion,</hi> Fidus <hi>denied not the baptisme of Infants, but denied that they ought to be baptized before the eighth day.</hi> But you might have further observed, that <hi>Fidus</hi> alleadged, <hi>considerandam esse legem Circumcisionis anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quae,</hi> that <hi>he thought the law of ancient Circumcision was to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.</hi> And, <hi>Vestigium Infantis in primis partus sui diebus constitut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fe teachers among Christians. You say <hi>Cyprian assures him, that by the unanimous consent of</hi> 66 <hi>Bishops gathered together in a Councell, baptisme was to be administred to Infantes, as well as to growne men; and not to be restrained to any time, which is true,</hi> but you adde, <hi>and proves it by such arguments as these. They are under originall sinne, they neede pardon, are capable of grace and mercy, God regards not age, &amp;c.</hi> But the resolution of <hi>Cyprian</hi> with his Collegues is not so lightly to be passed over, sith the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this Councell, as far as I can by search finde, is the very spring-head of Infant-baptisme. To conceive it aright, it is to be considered, that you are mistaken, about the proofe of their opinion; the things you mention, are not the proofe, but are produced in answer of objections. The proofe is but one, except you will make a proofe of that which is in the close of the Epistle, which is, <hi>that whereas none is to be kept from baptisme, and the grace of God, much lesse New-borne Infants, who in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect doe deserve more of our ayde, and Gods mercy, because in the beginning of their birth they presently crying and weeping doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but pray.</hi> The onely proofe is this, <hi>the mercy and grace of God is to be denyed to none, that are borne of man, for the Lord saith in the Gospell, that the sonne of man came not to destroy mens soules, but to save them, and therefore as much as in us lyes, if it may be, no soule is to be lost, and therefore all infants at all times to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</hi> Whence we may observe: 1. That they thought baptizing, giving Gods grace, and the denying it, denying Gods grace: Secondly, that they thought the soules to be lost that were not baptized. Thirdly, that therefore not onely Infants of beleivers, but all infants were to be baptized. Whence <hi>Tossanus</hi> in his Synopsis, Notes this for <hi>Cyprians</hi> errour that he taught, <hi>Infantes Statim esse baptizandos ne pereant, quod eis misericordia non sit deneganda Ep.</hi> 8. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. Then follow the objections, which are three. First, <hi>That Infants are not capable being so young:</hi> this he answers by saying <hi>God regards not age,</hi> which he proves by an allegoricall accomodation of <hi>Elisha,</hi> his stretching himselfe upon the little Childe, to the applying of Gods grace to Infants. The second objection is, <hi>But we shun to kisse Infantes as uncleane in the first dayes of their birth</hi>:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43338:10"/>
to this he answers, <hi>that to the cleane all things are cleane; and we ought not to decline the embracing Gods worke.</hi> The third objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>was the Law of circumcision,</hi> to this he answers, that <hi>in Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision the eighth day was a figure of the resurrection of Christ: Which is now accomplished, and we are to account now nothing common or uncleane: and therefore we are not to account this an impedinent to obtaine grace by Baptisme.</hi> Then he addes further, <hi>if any thing could hinder from obtaining of grace, greater sinnes should hinder men of yeares from it, now if greater sinnes hinder not men of yeares from it, but that they when they beleive obtaine forgivenes, grace, and Baptisme, by how much rather is an Infant not to be forbidden, who being newly borne, hath not sinned, except in that being borne carnally according to</hi> Adam, <hi>he hath contracted the contagion of ancient death in his first Nativity, who in this respect comes more easily to receive remission of sinnes, because not his owne sinnes, but anothers are forgiven him:</hi> So that whereas you say, that <hi>Cyprian proves: that Infants are to be baptized because they are under Originall sinne, they neede pardon</hi>; You may perceive that the argument is rather thus, they have lesser sinnes then others, they neede lesse pardon then men of growne yeares, and therefore there is lesse hinderance in them to come to Gods grace, remission of sinnes and Baptisme: thus have I considered that famous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of a Councel of 66. Bishops, which for the nakednes of it I should more willingly have covered, were it not that the truth hath so much suffered by the great esteeme that this absurd Epistle hath had in many Ages.</p>

Ecce non de Augustino, sed de Evangelio protuli, cui cum maxime vos credere dicatis aut aliorum fide alios tandem posse salvari concedite, aut de Evangelio esse quae posui si potestis, negate.</hi> From these passages I gather, that as <hi>Petrus Cluniacensis</hi> urged for paedo-baptisme the authority of <hi>Augustine</hi> and the Latine Doctors, So <hi>Peter de Bruis</hi> and <hi>Henricus</hi> appealed to the Scriptures, and the Greeke Church: Now the reason of <hi>Augustines</hi> authority was this, the <hi>Pelagian</hi> heresie being generally condemned, and <hi>Augustines</hi> workes being greatly esteemed, as being the hammer of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> the following refuters of <hi>Pelagianisme, Prosper, Fulgentius</hi> &amp;c. the Councells that did condemne it as those of <hi>Carthage, Arles Milevis &amp;c.</hi> did rest altogether on <hi>Augustines</hi> arguments, and often on his words, and <hi>Augustine</hi> in time was accounted one of the foure Doctors of the Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4. You may consider, that <hi>Augustine</hi> held such a certainty of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining regeneration by Baptisme, that not only he puts usually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation for Baptisme, but also he makes no question of the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Infants, though they that brought them, did not bring them with that faith, that they might be regenerated by spirituall grace to eternall life; but because by Baptisme they thought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure health to their bodies, as is plain by his words, <hi>epist.</hi> 23. <hi>ad Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifacium.

            <p n="5">5. You may consider, that in the same Epistle, when <hi>Bonifacius</hi> pressed <hi>Augustine</hi> to shew how Sureties could be excused from lying, who being asked of the Childs faith, answered, <hi>He doth believe,</hi> (for even in Baptisme of Infants they thought in all ages it necessary that a profession of faith go before) He defends that act in this absurd manner: <hi>Respondetur credere propter fid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>i Sacramentum,</hi> And thence is he called a believer because he hath the Sacrament of faith. Which as it is a ridiculous playing with words, in so serious a matter before God, so it is a senslesse answer, sith the interrogation was of the Childs faith before it was baptized, and the answer was given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and therefore it cannot be understood of believing by receiving the sacrament of faith, which came after.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is apparent out of the same Epistle, that Infants were then admitted to baptisme, whether they were the children of believers, or not; it was no matter with what intention they brought them, nor whose children were brought; yea it was counted a work of charity to bring any children to baptisme, and in this case the faith
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43338:12"/>
of the whole Church was counted a sufficient supplement of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the parents or bringers faith: So that whereas the present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of Infant-baptisme, pretend Covenant-holinesse a priviledge of Believers, it was no such matter in the time of the Ancients, but they baptized any Infants, even of Infidels, upon this opinion, That Baptisme did certainly give grace to them; and if they dyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out baptism<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Lastly, there are many evidences that do as strongly prove, as proofs are usually taken in such matters, That it was not so from the beginning: As particularly, 1. The continued propounding of the ordinary questions even to Infants, concerning their faith, repentance, and obedience, afore they were baptized, which in the School-men was still held necessary, and therefore Sureties thought necessary to answer for them, yea even in Reformed Churches, unto this day: which as it was conceived by <hi>Strabo,</hi> and <hi>Vives</hi> in his Comment on <hi>Aug. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de civit. Dei, c.</hi> 27. a cleare evidence; so I conceive any reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able man will think it to be a manifest proof, that at first none were baptized but such as understood the faith of Christ. 2 The examples before mentioned, of the baptizing <hi>Gregory Nazianzen, Chrysostom, Augustine, Constantine the great,</hi> &amp;c. being children of professors of Christianity, is a manifest proof they did not then baptize Infants ordinarily, but extraordinarily in case of necessity. 3. Specially if we joyn hereto the disswasions of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> forementioned. 4. The plain testimony of the Councel of <hi>Neo-Caesarea</hi> agai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The many passages in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> and others, referring it only to Apostolicall tradition, and that usually proved by no higher testimony than <hi>Cyprian,</hi> &amp; that brought in upon erroneous grounds, is a strong evidence it came not from the Apostles. To all which I may add the testimony of <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore recited, concerning the Greek Church; the testimony of <hi>Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicus Vives, Comment. in August. de civit.

            <p>To all which I only answer thus, that much of this is true I make no question, though perhaps vehemency of opposition, hath made matters more or worse then they were, as it is wont to be in such cases, and I finde that <hi>Gualter</hi> in his Apology for <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> saith of them, <hi>verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis studiosi videri vellent,</hi> and <hi>Cassander</hi> speakes favourably of some of them.

First I see that all that reject the baptizing of Infants, do &amp; must upon the same grounds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the religious observation of the Lords day, or the Christian Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, <hi>viz.</hi> because there is not (say they) an expresse institution or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the New Testament.</q>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, What a word hath gotten out of the hedge of your teeth! They doe, They must.</hi> Though I doubt not of your will, yet I see you want some skil in pleading for the Lords day, that others have: the truth is that it is neither so, nor so, <hi>They neither doe, nor must reject upon the same ground the Lords day.</hi> That they doe not I can speake for one; and your owne words delivered after with more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Verily I have hardly either knowne, or read, or heard,</hi> intimate that though few, yet you cannot say, but you have heard, or read or knowne of some, that have not with baptizing of Infants rejected the Lords day; but you have, I presume, heard or read of whole, and those reformed Churches, that have upon such a ground rejected the Lords day as not of divine institution, who yet are zealous for paedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme. <hi>Nor must they,</hi> And to make that good, let us consider their ground as you mention it. Their ground you say is, <hi>because there is not an expresse institution or command in the New Testament</hi>: this then is their principle, that what hath not an expresse institution or command in the New Testament is to be rejected. But give me leave to tell you, that you leave out two explications that are needefull to be taken in; First, that when they say so, they meane it of positive instituted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, consisting in outward rites, such as Circumcision, Baptisme and the Lords Supper are, which have nothing morall or naturall in them, but are in whole and in part Ceremoniall. For that which is naturall or morall in worship, they allow an institution or command in the old Testament as obligatory to Christians, and such doe they conceive a Sabbath to be, as being of the Law of nature, that outward worship being due to God, dayes are due to God to that end, and therefore even in <hi>Paradise,</hi> appointed from the creation; and in all nations, in all ages observed: enough to prove so much to be of the Law of nature, and therefore the fourth Commandement justly put amongst the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals; and if a seventh day indefinitely be commanded there, as some of your Assembly have indeavourd to make good, I shall not gainsay: though in that point of the <hi>quota pars temporis</hi> which is moral, I do yet <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> suspend my judgement. Now Circumcision hath nothing moral in it, it is meerely positive, neither from the beginning, nor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by all nations in all ages, nor in the Decalogue, and therefore a Sabbath may stand, though it fall. 2. The other explication is, that when they require expresse institution or command in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, they doe not meane that in positive worship there must be
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43338:18"/>
a command <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> in so many words, in forme of a precep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, but they conceive that Apostolicall example, which hath not a meere temporary reason, is enough to prove an institution from God, to which that practise doth relate. And in this, after some evidences in the Scripture of the New Testament, they ascribe much to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant practise of the Church in all ages. Now then if it be considered, that when <hi>Paul</hi> was at <hi>Troas, Acts.</hi> 20.7. the Disciples came together to breake bread, and <hi>Paul</hi> preached upon the first day of the weeke, and <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1.2. as he had appointed in the Churches of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia,</hi> so he appoints at <hi>Corinth</hi> collections for the poore the first day of the week; &amp; <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.10. it hath the <hi>Elogium</hi> or title of the Lords day; and it was so Sacred among Christians, that it was made the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of inquisitors of Christianity, <hi>Dominicum servasti</hi>? Hast thou kept the Lords day? to which was answered, <hi>Christianus sum, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittere non possum,</hi> I am a Christian, I may not omit it: it is cleare evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to me, that either Christ or the Apostles, having abrogated the old Sabbath, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16. subrogated the first day of the weeke instead of it. Now if a moity of this could be brought for Paedobaptisme, in the stead of Circumcision of infants, I should subscribe to it with you. But Paedobaptisme not consisting with the order of Christ in the institution, being contrary to the usage of it by <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> &amp; the Apostles, there being no foote-steps of it, till the erroneous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit grew of giving Gods grace by it, and the necessity of it to save an infant from perishing, some hundreds of yeares after Christs incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; I dare not assent to the practise of it upon a supposed analogy, equity or reason of the rule of Circumcision, and imaginary confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration with the beleiving parent in the Covenant of grace. For to me it is a dangerous principle upon which they go that so argue: to wit, that in meere positive things (such as Circumcision and Baptism are) we may frame an addition to Gods worship from analogy or resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance conceived by us betweene two ordinances, whereof one is quite taken away, without any institution gathered by precept or Apostolicall example. For if we may doe it in one thing, why not in a nother? where shall we stay? They that read the Popish expositors of their Rituals,<note place="margin">

I desire any learned man to set me downe a rule from Gods Word, how far I may go in my conceived parity of reason, equity or analogy, and where I must

And for the other pillar upon which at this day paedobaptisme is built, it is to me very dangerous, viz. <hi>That the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Evangelicall grace is made to beleivers and their seede, that the children are confederates with the Parents in the Covenant of grace.</hi> Which without such restrictions or explications as agree not with the common use of the words (which in the plaine sense import this, that God in his Covenant of grace by Christ hath promised not only to justifie and save beleiving Parents, but also their children) is in my apprehension plainly against the Apostles determination, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6, 7, 8. makes an addition to the Gospell mentioned <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8 9. and drawes with it many dangerous consequences, which I abhorre. You adde, <q>Now God hath so blessed the religious observation of the Lords day in this Kingdome above other Churches and Kingdomes, that such as indeavour to overthrow it, deserve justly to be abhorred by us</q>. Upon occasion of which passage I only desire to intimate to you, that from happy events its not safe to conclude, that a thing pleaseth God. You know it is the way the Monks and Prelates use to inferre that their institution is of God, because their Orders have yeelded so many pious Confessors, Martyrs and Saints; &amp; it too much countenanceth the way of arguing for Independency (by which it hath prevailed) in Letters from abroad, and suggestions at home, still harping on this string, that it is the way of God, because they that are in that way thrive &amp; grow more spirituall then others. And if this arguing be good, It prospers, therefore it pleaseth God; then it will follow on the contrary, It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spers not, therefore it pleaseth not God: And if so, we might inferre Infant baptisme is of men, not of God, sith <hi>if conscience and experience may speake, there are but few Christians that have tasted the sweete &amp; comfort of their baptisme, as</hi> Mr. <hi>Shepard,</hi> in his Epistle before <hi>Philips</hi> vind: of infant-bap. The other note is this, that when you say, that such

               <q>Or else all are saved, as having no originall sin, and consequently needing no Saviour, which most of the Anabaptists in the world do owne, and therewith bring in also all Pelagianisme, universall grace, free-will, &amp;c.</q> This I imagine is the error you conceive depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Anti-paedobaptisme. I finde Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> stands much upon this in his Birth-right-priviledge, <hi>pag.</hi> 17. where he saith, <q>The Anabaptists in this present age, well see, that all that joyn in this tenent saile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween those rocks, either to affirm, that infants die in their pollution, or perish in their birth-sin, or else to deny this originall pollution, or any birth-sin at all.</q> But for my part I see no reason of this, unlesse it be granted that no infant can have sin forgiven, unlesse it b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. May it not be said, that some, or all infants are saved, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their birth-sin, by the grace of God electing them, putting them into Christ, uniting them to him by his Spirit, forgiving them their birth-sin through Christs obedience, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lthough they be not bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed? As corrupt as the Schoolmen were, they could say, <hi>Gratia Dei non alligatur Sacramentis,</hi> The grace of God is not tyed to Sacraments. If most of the Anabaptists hold universall grace, and free-will, there may be as much said of most of the paedobaptists, taking in a great part of the Papists, almost all the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> and if
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43338:21"/>
they denyed originall sin, it is their dangerous error, but it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent on their denying Paedobaptisme. But the late confession of faith made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n the name of 7. Churches of them in <hi>London, Art.</hi> 4, 5, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26. will abundantly answer for them in this point of <hi>Pelagianisme.</hi> The third is, <q>Or that although they be tainted with originall corruption, and so need a Saviour, Christ doth <hi>pro bene pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cito,</hi> save some of the infants of Turks and Indians dying in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, as well as some of the infants of Christians, and so carry sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Christ out of the Church beyond the Covenant of grace, where God never made any promise.</q> Nor doth this follow: for it may be said, all that dye in their infancy are not damned, nor all saved because they have no birth-sin, nor some of the Indians saved. For the some that may be saved, may be the infants of believers, to whom God may forgive their birth-sin, without baptisme. Thus you may perceive, how the push of all the horns of your horned Syllogisme may be avoyded. But you conceive it a great absurdity to say, <q>That Christ doth <hi>pro bene placito</hi> save some of the infants of Indians:</q> it is true, it is a bold saying, to say he doth save them, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, that if the infants of Indians be saved, salvation is carryed without the Church, for they may be of the invisible Church of the elect, to whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs the promise made to <hi>Abraham, I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed.</hi> But if you mean it of the visible, though I disclaim <hi>Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius</hi> his opinion (who was a stiffe assertor of Paedobaptisme, and I think the founder of the new way of maintaining it, by the new ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the Covenant of grace) that <hi>Hercules, Arist des, Socrates, Numa,</hi> and such like heathens are now in heaven; yet I cannot say no persons without the communion of the visibl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ordinary answer to this argument, is by denying that Infants are under the Covenant of grace, only some few deny the consequence, that although they were within the Covenant, yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not that they must be sealed, because say they, the women among the Jews were under the covenant, yet received not circumcision, which was the seal of the Covenant.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:43338:22"/>They that deny the consequence of your argument, do it justly, for the consequence must be proved by this universall: All that are <hi>foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derati,</hi> must be <hi>signati,</hi> all that are in the covenant of Grace must be sealed, which is not true. If it were true, it must be so, either by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of some necessary connexion between the termes, which is none; for it is but a common accident to a man that hath a promise or a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made to him, that he should have a speciall sign, it may <hi>adesse, vel abesse a subjecto,</hi> it may be present, or absent from the subject: God made a speciall promise to <hi>Joshuah,</hi> that he should bring <hi>Israel</hi> into the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi>; to <hi>Phineas</hi> a covenant of an everlasting Priesthood, without any speciall sign or seal distinct from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; or else it must be so by reason of Gods will declared concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the covenant of Grace, but that is not true. The promise made to <hi>Adam,</hi> which you confesse was the same in substance with the covenant of Grace, had no speciall sign or seal annexed to it; <hi>Noah, Abel</hi> were within the covenant of Grace, yet no speciall sign ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them, therefore it is not Gods will that all that are <hi>foederati</hi> in the Covenant, must be <hi>signati,</hi> Sealed; if they had been <hi>signati,</hi> though they were <hi>foederati,</hi> it had been will-worship, God not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing it to them. But you will say, all that are <hi>foederati</hi> should be <hi>signati,</hi> since the solemn Covenant with <hi>Abraham.</hi> But neither is this certain, sith we finde no such thing concerning <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> that lived in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, nor concerning <hi>Job,</hi> that it's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived lived after his time. You will say, but it is true of all the <hi>foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derati</hi> in <hi>Abrahams</hi> family: but neither is that true, for male chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren before the eighth day, and women, though federate, yet were not to be signed. So that you see it is so far from being universally true, that all that are <hi>foederati,</hi> must be <hi>signati</hi>; that this is all which is true, all the male children of <hi>Abrahams</hi> family if they were eight dayes old, must be signed with the sign of Circumcision, which never will be able to prove the consequence of your Enthym<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <q>But you say this receives an easie answer, the women were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in the males, else God could not have said, that the whole house of <hi>Israel</hi> were circumcised in the flesh, else could not the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Jews be called the Circumcision, in opp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> away the exception
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43338:22"/>
against that universall proposition which must prove the consequence of your Enthymeme: The answer is, <hi>That women were circumcised in the males.</hi> You expresse it thus, pag. 28. where you repeat the same thing. <hi>This sign was actually applyed only to the males, yet the females were virtually circumcised in them</hi>: So this is your meaning. The women were not circumcised at all, yet that the males were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, it was all one as if they had been circumcised in their persons. Now then let us scan this answer: the conclusion to be proved was, that Infants were to be sealed actually, not virtually. For if a virtuall sealing, or baptizing were all that you would prove, we might grant it; we may say infants are virtually baptized in their parents, and yet it may be unlawfull to baptize them actually; as it would have been unlawfull to have circumcised women actually, notwithstanding their virtuall circumcision. For it had been a will-worship, there being no command to do it. And indeed, to speak exactly, women were not circumcised virtually in the males; for he is said virtually to have a thing by another, as by a Proxie, or Attorny, that might receive it by himselfe, yet <hi>quoad effectum juris,</hi> according to the effect of Law, anothers receiving is as if he had received it: but so the males did not receive circumcision for the females, for the females might not be circumcised in their own persons, it had been their sin, if they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieved it, God not appointing it: As it had been a sin for a childe to be circumcised afore or after the eighth day, in them that altered or swerved from the appointment of God: Now then this being the conclusion to be proved, That infants of believing parents are to be actually signed or sealed, the proposition must be meant of the same signing or sealing, and the Syllogisme thus framed. All that are <hi>foede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rati,</hi> must be actually <hi>signati.</hi> All the infants of believers are <hi>foederati, Ergo,</hi> All the infants of believers must be actually <hi>signati</hi>: If you do not thus frame your Syllogisme, but put in the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>position virtually signed, and in your conclusion actually signed, your Syllogisme hath four termes, and so is naught. If you do not put actually signed in the conclusion, you conclude not that which you should prove. Now this also occasions me to note another fault in your argument, to wit, your concluding that which was not the question, which was not of any sign indefinitely, but of baptisme. You cannot say it is all one, for there are other signes of the Covenant besides baptisme, as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision of old, so the Lords Supper now. If then I should grant the conclusion, That infants of believers are to be <hi>signati,</hi> yet you would
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43338:23"/>
say they are not to be pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>takers of the Lords Supper, because it is not appointed for them. So in like manner if it were granted you, that infants of believers are to be signed, yet it follows not that they are to be baptized unlesse you can prove it is appointed to them; and the truth is, if it were granted, that children were <hi>foederati,</hi> yet it were a high presumption in us to say, therefore they must be <hi>signati,</hi> without Gods declaration of his minde, and if it were granted they must be <hi>signati,</hi> it were in like manner a high presumption in us to say, therefore they must be baptized, without Gods declaration of his minde concerning that Ordinance. Though it may be good to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thus, it is Gods minde, therefore it is to be done; yet it is a great pride of spirit for us to argue, This should be, therefore God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it. As for the reasons you bring to prove that women were virtually circumcised in the males, they prove it not, for when it is said <hi>The whole house of Israel were circumcised in the flesh,</hi> the sense is not, every person is either actually, or virtually circumcised, but all the house of <hi>Israel</hi> is put for a great part, or the greater, or the most eminent, as it is frequently elswhere, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.3. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.36. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.24. as the whole Church is said to come together, when the most of them come together. And in the like manner the people of the Jews may be called the <hi>Circumcision,</hi> from the greater or more famous part, though the women be neither actually nor virtually circumcised. As a field of wheat may be called from the greater or most eminent part; as a Church of believers, from the greater or most eminent part, though the rest be neither actually nor virtually believers. And for your other reason, <hi>pag.</hi> 28. <q>It was Gods expresse order, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.28. No uncircumcised person might eat of the Passeover, which we are sure women did, as well as men, therefore they were virtually circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised; <hi>Neither is this cogent.</hi>
               </q> For, the Proposition is thus to be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>pro subjecta materia,</hi> according to the subject matter. No un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcised person might eat thereof, that ought to be circumcised: Now women were not appointed to be circumcised at all, therefore they need not either actually to be circumcised, or to have any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised for them, or in their stead, which you mean (I think) by virtuall circumcision. Now I have dwelt so long on your Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, because I still stick at this, That no reason of ours in positive worship, can acquit an action that is performed, from will-worship. Nothing but Gods will, manifest in his institution, gathered by some command or example now in force, can do it. Neverthelesse, because

and if this be the meaning, the Covenant of grace is given to every godly man, and in every godly man to his seed, if they do believe, then it is no more then the Covenant of grace is given to every godly man, and then it is but trifling to adde, <hi>and in every godly man to his seed,</hi> sith nothing more is expressed, but what was said before, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing convayed from the godly man to his seed; some promises have no condition, as the promise of <hi>writing Gods Laws in our hearts,</hi> for if any condition be put, we shall fall into <hi>Pelagianisme,</hi> that grace is given according to our merits. 2.

And for that which he saith, <hi>God will have some of the seed of every godly man to stand before him for ever,</hi> meaning this, as I conceive, of election and covenant of grace, or some state consequent upon these, it is but a bold dictate without proofe, imposing on Gods counsell and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, especially sith God hath declared so expresly after the Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>That he will have mercy on whom he will have mercy.</hi> Exod. 33.19. whence the Apostle infers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18. an unlimited freedome notw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Besides, if that which Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> saith were true, how is it that the Candlestick

is removed quite from some people, and the naturall branches broken off, and the branches besides nature, even of the wilde Olive, graffed into the true Olive? Then, suppose a godly man have but one childe, that childe must infalliby stand before God. It is said indeed <hi>Jer.</hi> 35.19. and Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> seems to allude to it, <hi>Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.</hi> But this stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding before God is not meant of election to eternall life, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, but of preservation in the destruction of Jerusalem, and being after the Captivity of <hi>Babylon Scribes,</hi> as <hi>Junius annot. in Jerem.</hi> 35.19. gathers from 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 2.55. and <hi>for ever</hi> is in many places meant of a temporall duration for some ages.

               </gap>ssary by those that know how apt many are to swallow down such mens dictates without exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. But I proceed.</p>
            <p>Nor are we to account Infants of believers by an act of opinion according to a rule of prudence, by which the Sacraments are to be administred, to belong to God <hi>in facie Eccl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accounted by an act of opinion according to a rule of charity to belong to God, it hath no place in this matter. For judging of mens present estate by a rule of charity, is when men judge of others the best, that their words and works may be interpreted to signifie, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.7. <hi>Charity believes all things</hi>: But infants do not shew any thing by words or works that may signifie their thoughts, and therefore in respect of them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be good or bad, we can have no judgement, but must only suspend our act of judging them. But if by judgement of chariry be meant, as some expresse it, conceiving a thing to be so, because we know nothing to the contrary, then are we to conceive all infants to belong to God, yea almost all men in the world by the judgement of charity, because for ought we know to the contrary, all may be elected. Wherefore I must either here stop, or else gather your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by your expressions in other parts of your Sermon, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of those with whom I conceive you concurre in opinion; and therefore if I should not exactly light on your meaning, you are to thank your selfe, but not to blame me. This is then that which I conceive you meane. That in the promise which God made to <hi>Abraham, That he would be his God, and the God of his seed,</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:43338:26"/>
as this promise comprehends Evangelicall blessings, the infants of believers are comprehended, and therefore they are <hi>foederati,</hi> taken into Covenant with their Parents. And yet I am at a stand, whether, when you say they are taken into Covenant with their Parents, and that the promise, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed,</hi> belongs to them in respect of Evangelicall blessings, you mean it in respect of saving graces, or the priviledge of outward Ordinances, though the latter is no more true then the former, yet it is lesse dangerous, and sometimes your expressions incline me to think you mean no more, especially that which you say pag. 13. <hi>Secondly, All true believers are Abrahams seed,</hi> Gal. 3.29. <hi>These only are made partakers of the spirituall part of the Covenant,</hi> neverthelesse, because the most of your expressions carry it thus, that you conceive that God hath promised according to the Covenant with <hi>Abraham, I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed,</hi> to be the God of the naturall seed of believers, in respect of the saving benefits of the Covenant of grace in Christ, and your proofes tend that way. I shall oppose that assertion. But that I may not be thought to wrong you, or <hi>cum larvis luctari,</hi> to fight with a vizour, the reasons why I conceive you mean, or at least your readers are likely to take your meaning so, are these, you say pa. 8. <hi>My first argument is, They are within the Covenant of grace belonging to Christs body, kingdome, family, therefore are to partake of the seal of his Covenant, or the distinguishing badge between them who are under the Covenant of grace, and them who are not.</hi> Pag. 9. You expresse your second conclusion thus. <hi>God will have the Infants of such as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Covenant with him, to be accounted his, as well as their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi>: You set downe the substance of the Covenant of Grace. pag. 10. to consist in those benefits, and then you often say, <hi>The children are in the Covenant of grace with their believing Parents:</hi> and pag. 31. You reject the asserting to the Infants of believers priviledges peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to some, and assert the priviledges belonging to the Covenant of grace, <hi>which all that are in Covenant may claime,</hi> which you say, <hi>God made to Abraham, and all his seed.</hi> Besides, your Texts you produce tend to prove that, as <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. &amp;c. and you say, pag. 15. <hi>They shall be made free of Gods City, according to Abrahams Copy, I will bee thy God, and the God of thy seed,</hi> which in respect of us Gentiles, can have no other meaning, then in respect of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, sanctification, and salvation, &amp; p. 16. speaking of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> you
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43338:27"/>
say, <hi>Let him professe the faith of Christ, and the Covenant of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on comes to his house, for now he is made a son of</hi> Abraham, <hi>that is,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams <hi>promise now reacheth him.</hi> And pag. 26. <hi>The proving of the two first conclusions gains the whole cause, if the Covenant b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whence <hi>George Downham</hi> of Justification lib. 6. cap. 6. §. 4. speakes thus. <hi>The other promises concerning his seed are two: The former concerning the multiplication of his seed, that he should be a father of a multitude of Nations, namely, in Christ, and that he would be a God to him and his seed, he doth not say to seeds, as of many, but as of one, to thy seed, which is Christ,</hi> Gal. 3.16. <hi>that is, Christ mysticall,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.12. <hi>Contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the multitude of the faithfull in all Nations, both Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. This promise therefore implyeth the former, that in Christ, the promised seed,</hi> Abraham <hi>himselfe, and his seed that is, the faithfull of all Nations should be blessed: And in confirmation of this promise, he was called</hi> Abraham, <hi>because he was to be a Father of many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that is, of the faithfull of all Nations, for none but they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted</hi> Abrahams <hi>seed,</hi> Rom. 9.7.8. Gal. 3.7.29. Thus he opens the Apostles meaning, and thus frequently do Protestant Divines in their writings. Now if only believers are in that promise, as it was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of saving grace, then it is not made to the naturall posterity, as such, of any believer, much lesse of us Gentiles.</p>
            <p>My third reason is this. The Covenant of grace is the Gospel, and so you call it, pag. 37. when you say, <hi>This is a part of the Gospel preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto</hi> Abraham. Now the Gospel preached to <hi>Abraham,</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle thus expresseth, Gal. 3.8, 9. <hi>And the Scripture foreseeing, that God would justifie the heathen through faith, preached before the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel unto Abraham, saying, in thee shall all Nations be blessed: so then, they which be of faith, are blessed with faithfull</hi> Abraham, and ver. 11. <hi>But that no man is justified by the Law in the sight of God, it is evident, for the just shall live by Faith,</hi> it is Hab. 2.4. <hi>By his faith.</hi> And ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, when Divines distinguish of the Covenant of grace, and of workes, they say the condition of the Covenant of grace is faith. They then that say the Covenant of grace belongs not only to believers, but also to their naturall children, whether believing or not, these adde to the Gospel, and the Apostle saith of such, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9. <hi>Let him be accursed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:43338:30"/>Fourthly, I thus argue: If God have made a Covenant of grace in Christ, not only to believers, but also to their seed, or naturall chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then it is either conditionally, or absolutely; if conditionally, the condition is either of works, and then grace should be of works, con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rary to the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.8. or of Faith, and then the sense is, God hath promised grace to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lievers, and to their seed, if belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that is, to believers, and believers, which is nugatory. If this Covenant of grace to believers seed be absolute, then either God keeps it, or not: if he do not keep it, then he breaks his word, which is blasphemy; if he do keep it, then it follows, that all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity of believers are saved, contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.13. or if some are not saved, though they be in the Covenant of grace, there may bee Apostasie of persons in the Covenant of grace, by which the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments brought by Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> in his <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> and others for perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in grace are evacuated, and <hi>Bertius</hi> his <hi>Hymenaeus desertor</hi> justified. The truth is, generally to be in the Covenant of grace, and to be elect, and to persevere in grace, are meant of the same persons, according to the Apostles doctrine, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.7, 8. &amp;c. and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon doctrine of the Contra-Remonstrants. And on the contrary, <hi>Bertius</hi> in his book <hi>de Apostasia sanctorum,</hi> pag. 79. among other ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities which he reckons as consequent on their opinion that deny Apostasie of Saints, puts this as the seventh. <hi>Baptismum non obsignare certo in omnibus liberis fidelium gratiam Dei (quum inter illos qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam sint etiam antecedente decreto Dei ab aeterno absolute reprobati) ac proinde dubitandum esse fidelibus de veritate foederis divini, Ego sum Deus tuus, &amp; seminis tui post te.</hi> And when this was urged by the Author of the Synod of <hi>Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sect. 6. in these words. <hi>For to every person whom they bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, they apply the promises of the Covenant of grace, clean contrary to their own doctrine,</hi> which saith, <hi>that they nothing belong to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates of the world,</hi> Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi> answers, that however in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of charity they take all Infants brought to be baptized, to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, yet the promises of the Covenant of grace do indeed belong only to the El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ct, which he proves at large, by shewing that there are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of the Covenant of grace, as of regeneration, circumcising the heart, writing the Law in their hearts, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. which must needs be absolute. For no condition can be assigned of performing these promises, but that it will follow, <hi>That grace is given, to wit, the grace of faith, according to mens workes, which is plaine Pelagianisme.</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:43338:30"/>
Whence he concludes. <hi>Now then who are they on whom God should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow faith and regeneration, but Gods Elect? And accordingly Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme as it is a Seale, and assurance of performing this promise of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and salvation unto them that believe, so it is a seale and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the promise of circumcising the heart, and regeneration only to Gods Elect.</hi> And after pag. 192. <hi>VVe are ready to maintaine, that all who are under the covenant of grace, are such as over whom sin shall not have the dominion,</hi> Rom. 6.14.</p>
            <p>Besides, he that shall heare you preach, that the children of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are in the Covenant of grace, and that they that are in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace cannot fall away, may be apt to conceive himselfe within the Covenant of grace without repentance and faith, and that he shall be saved without obedience, and so lay a ground-work for <hi>Antinomianisme,</hi> and consequently Libertinisme. And may not on the other side believing Parents, when they see their children vicious, and ungodly, doubt whether they themselves be true believers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they see not their ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ldren in the Covenant of grace; and so while you think to comfort parents about their children, you may create great discomfort concerning themselves.</p>
            <p>Lastly, if this were true, that the Covenant of grace is a birth-right priviledge, then the children of believers are children of grace by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for that which is a birth-right priviledge, is a priviledge by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and if, as Mr. <hi>Blak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> saith, pag. 6. of his book, <hi>Christianity is hereditary, that as the childe of a Noble man is Noble, the childe of a freeman is free, the childe of a Turke is a Turke, of a Jew a Iew, the childe of a Christian is a Christian</hi>; then Christians are born Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, not made Christians, and how are they then children of wrath by nature? which whether they may not advantage Pelagians, and denyers of Originall sin, it concernes those that use such speeches, to consider.</p>
            <p>But the Author of the writing entituled <hi>Infants baptizing proved lawfull by Scripture,</hi> mentions other promises besides that <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. to wit, <hi>Deu.</hi> 28.4. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.2.6. <hi>Isa.</hi> 44.3. <hi>Isa.</hi> 59.21. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.6. <hi>Psal.</hi> 112.2. and such like.

            <p>This passage I might have passed over, as containing nothing but dictates; Yet I think it necessary to observe, 1. That you do very carnally imagine the Church of God to be like Civill corporations, as if persons were admitted to it by birth, whereas in this all is done by free election of grace, and according to Gods appointment: nor is God tied, or doth tie himself in the erecting and propagating his Church, to any such carnall respects, as descent from men. Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity is no mans birth-right; The Apostle knew not that God had so by promise, or other ingagement bound himself, but he was free, as he said to <hi>Moses</hi> after the promise made to <hi>Abraham, to have mercy on whom he would,</hi> Rom. 9.15. Yea, to conceive that it is in Gods Church, as in other Kingdomes, and after the laws of Nations, is a seminary of dangerous superstitions and errors.

VVhether they who obey this call, were the present Jews to whom he spake, or were afar off: whether by afar off, you will mean the Gentiles, who as yet worshipped afar off, or the Jews, or any who were yet unborn, and so were afar off in time, or whether they dwelt in the remotest parts of the world, and so were afar off in place; The argument holds good to the end of the world, Repent and be baptized for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the Holy Ghost, for the promise is made to you and your children, they shall be made free of Gods city according to Abrahams copy.

Divinity for that interpretation, and yet I thinke all the strength of your proofe lies in this imagined parallelisme. Nor doe you tell us of what thing this promise was, which you parallel with <hi>Abrahams</hi> copy, I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed; whether it was a promise of saving graces, or outward priviledges; Onely that which you bring in of <hi>Zaccheus</hi> to interpret it, <q>

               </q>seemes to import that you conceive the meaning thus; if you once obey the call of God as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, the promise of salvation is to you and your children: and sith you answer the second objection, which you call a shift, by rejecting the limiting of [<hi>to you and your children</hi>] with those words [<hi>as many as the Lord shall call</hi>] the sense must be this: <hi>The promise of salvation is to you and your children, whether the Lord our God call them or not.</hi> But this proposition I know you will not stand to, though as you handle the matter, this is made the Apostles assertion. But it may be you mean otherwise, thus: <hi>If you once obey the call of God, as Abraham did, the promise of outward church-priviledges, that is, to be members of the visible Church, partakers of Baptism, &amp;c. is to you and your children.</hi> Now what an uncouth reason is by this made in the Apostles speech, that if they did repent, and were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, <hi>the promise should be made good to them and to their children,</hi> (I use your own words, expressing what you conceive the strength of the argument lies in) <hi>that you &amp; they shalbe members of the visible church, partakers of baptism, &amp;c.</hi> So that the Apostle is made to say thus: If you will repent and be baptized, the promise is to you and your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that you &amp; they shalbe baptized.

Though it be of little moment, whether he were a Gentile or no, yet I conceive it more likely he was a Jew, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because his name is more like the hebrew, than the greek or latine; and partly because if he had been a Gentile, Christ had plainly discovered the calling of the Gentiles, which he did not till afterward: &amp; it would have caused in likelihood greater offence in them to hear a

            <p>You go on. <q>Nor secondly, can it be avoided by that shift of others who interpret it thus, to you and your children, as many of them as the Lord shall call, that is (say they) whether your selves or your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or any other whom the Lord shall call, if they repent and be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, they shall receive the gift of the holy Ghost.</q> If you put in stead of, [<hi>they shall receive the gift of the holy Ghost,</hi>] these words [<hi>the promise is to you and them,</hi>] it is no shift, but the genuine and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie explication of the text.

            </p>
            <p>You suppose here, that the Apostle used this argument onely in relation to the good of their children, whereas the maine matter was concerning themselves to erect them, who being told that they had <hi>crucified Iesus who was both Lord and Christ,</hi> verse 36. and had said, Matth. 27.25. <hi>His blood be upon us and our children, were pricked in their hearts,</hi> and said to <hi>Peter</hi> and the rest of the Apostles, <hi>Men and brethren what shall we doe</hi>? and was it not a comfortable argument for men in that case to be told, that notwithstanding all this, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of Christ, and remission of sinnes by him, was yet to them and their children, on whom they had wished Christs blood to be, and to all the Jewes that dwelt afarre off in the di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

children, and to be offered first to them, as it is <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46. But it was not to intimate that which you would gather, <hi>that the promise is such to them, if they did beleeve that their children, even their infants upon their fathers faith, whether the children were called or not, were taken into the covenant, either of saving graces, or visible church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership</hi>; which you should have proved, but never will prove out of this Scripture. But taking your Hypothesis, that these to whom <hi>Peter</hi> speakes were within the covenant made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and cirumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed rightly, and yet the Apostle requires these to repent, afore they are to be baptized; the Antipaedobaptists have hence a good argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst baptizing infants, because <hi>Peter</hi> required of such as were in the covenant, repentance afore Baptism. I passe on to the next proof you bring for your Conclusion.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 7. <hi>Of the text.</hi> Rom. 11.16.</note>YOu say, <q>as plain it is out of the 11. Rom. 16 &amp;c. where the apostles scope is to shew, that we Gentiles have now the same graffing into the true olive which the Jews formerly had; and our present graffing in, is answerable to their present casting out, &amp; their taking in in the latter end of the world, shall be the same graffing in (though more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously) as ours is now. Now all know that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were taken in, they and their children were taken in; when they were broken off, they and their children were broken off; when they shall be taken in, in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of the world, they and their children shall be taken in; and that because the root is holy, that is, Gods covenant with <hi>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,</hi> extends yet unto them, when their unbelief shall be taken away. The root being like Nebuchadnezars tree, the tree hewen down, and the root bound with a hand of iron, until seven times were passed over it, and then the bands should be broken, &amp; the root should spring, and the tree should grow again: So their present nation like this tree is cut down, and this holy root the covenant made with their forefathers is suspended, bound with an iron bar of unbelief, blindnesse being come upon them untill the fulnes of the Gentiles were come in, and then all Israel shall be saved. And mark, that in all this discourse, the holines of the branches there spoken of, is not meant of a personall inherent ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, but a derivative holines; a holines derived to them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, the first fruit is holy, the lump holy, the root holy, the branches holy, that is, the fathers holy, accepted in covenant with God; the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren beloved for their fathers sake, and when the vail of unbelief shall be taken away, the children and their posterity shal be taken in again, because beloved for their fathers sakes.

               </gap>e ingraffing, to me, is meant of the invisible church by election and faith; which invisible church was first amongst the Jews, and therefore called the olive, out of <hi>Abraham</hi> the root, who is therefore said to beare them. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Abraham</hi> had a double capacitie, one of a naturall father, and another of the father of the faithfull, in respect of the former c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, some are called <hi>branches according to nature,</hi> others, <hi>wilde olives by nature,</hi> yet <hi>graffed in by faith</hi>; and when it is said that <hi>some of the naturall branches were broken off,</hi> the meaning is not that some of the branches in the invisible church may be broken off: but as when our Saviour Christ saith, using the same similitude, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.2. <hi>Every branch in me not bearing fruit, he taketh away</hi>; The meaning is not, that any branch truely in him c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uld be fruitlesse, or taken away; but he calleth that a branch in him which was only so in appearance. So the Apostle speaking of branches broken off, meanes it not of such as were truely so, but in appearance: For <hi>similitudes doe not runne with four feet</hi>; but vary in some things. Now if this be the meaning of your words, that the insition of the Gentiles is the same with the Jewes, and the insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is meant of ingraffing by faith into the inv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <q>as plaine it is out of the eleventh of Rom. 16, &amp;c. where the Apostles scope is, to shew, that we Gentiles have now the same graffing into the true olive which the Jews former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had, and our present graffing in is answerable to their present cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out; and their taking in, in the latter end of the world, shal be the same graffing in (though more gloriously) as ours is now.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Apostles scope in the whole chapter is plaine to answer that question, <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>Hath God cast away his people</hi>? which he doth, 1. by

shewing for the present in himselfe, and others, perhaps unknowne, <hi>That God had then a remnant according to the election of grace.</hi> 2. For the future from ver. 11. to the end, that he intends a <hi>calling of all Israel when the fulnesse of the Gentiles shall come in,</hi> and ver. 16. is one argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove it. It is not the scope of the Apostle, as you say, <hi>To shew that the Gentiles have now the same graffing into the true Olive, which the Jews formerly had</hi>; but to prove that the Jews, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their pres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>You go on.</hi> 
               <q>And that because the root is holy, that is, Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> extends yet unto them, when their unbeliefe shall be taken away; and then after an illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> dreame, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.14, 15. you say of the Jews, their present Nation like this tree is cut down, and this holy root, the Covenant made with their forefathers is suspended, bound with an Iron barre of unbeliefe, blindnesse being come upon them till the fulnesse of the Gentiles be come in, and then all Israel shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</q> In this passage you somewhat alter the Apostles resemblance, who doth not make the Jewish Nation to answer the tree, but the branches, nor doth he say the tree is cut down, but the branches bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off; and here you make the <hi>Covenant the root,</hi> but a little after your words import, when you say, <hi>a holinesse derived from their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, &amp;c.</hi> that by the root you mean their Ancestors. And you say, <hi>The Covenant made with their forefathers is suspended,</hi> which in some sense may be true, that is thus, the effects of Gods love to Israel are for the present suspended from those generations, and so in our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension the Covenant is suspended; but in exact speech it cannot be true, sith Gods Covenant according to his intention and meaning, cannot be suspended or stayed, but doth alwayes take effect irresisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.

                  </gap> branches,</hi> you much pervert the Apostles meaning; who makes the tree, that is, the Church of believers, still standing, and some branches broken off, and others graffed in. And for that of the root, it is true, it is variously conceived by Interpreters, some understanding with you the Covenant, some Christ, some <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and some <hi>Abraham</hi> only, which last I conceive to be genuine, for the expressions of some branches <gap reason="foreign">

Now to say, <hi>the root, that is, Abraham, is bound with an Iron band of unbeliefe,</hi> cannot have any handsome construction. But you tell us: <q>And marke that in all this discourse, the holinesse of the branches there spoken of, is not meant of a personall inherent holinesse.</q> Then Master <hi>Thomas Goodwin</hi> is answered, who in urging 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. for Paedobaptisme, saith, <hi>in the New Testament, there is no other holinesse spoken of, but personall or reall by regeneration,</hi> about the which he challenged all the world to shew the contrary: whereas here is according to you, a holinesse which is not <hi>personall,</hi> or as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> speakes, <hi>qualitative, and inherent.</hi> But to go on.

to the tenor of his mercy, the infants of the wicked in their parents according to the tenor of his justice.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There are sundry things in this passage you would have to be mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that deserve indeed to be marked, but with an Obeliske, not with an Asteriske, as 1. That you oppose personall inherent holinesse to derivative, as inconsistent. The truth is, the holinesse the Apostle speaks of, is, first in respect of Gods Election, holinesse personall and inherent, in Gods intention, <hi>He hath chosen us that we should be holy,</hi> Ephes. 1.4. Secondly, it is also holinesse derivative, or descending, not from any Ancestors, but from <hi>Abraham,</hi> not barely, as a naturall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but as a spirituall father, or <hi>Father of the faithfull,</hi> and so deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Covenant of grace, which passed in his name to him and his seed. And lastly, it shall be inherent actually, being communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Spirit of God, when they shall be actually called. But this is such a kinde of holinesse, as is more then you mean, to wit, not only an adherent, or relative holinesse, which they have by enjoying outward Ordinances, but also inherent, by faith, whereby they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e holy, as the root, that is, <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the faithfull.</p>
            <p>2. Whereas you make it the case of any believers to be a holy root, to their posterity, especially in the following words, when you say, <q>The infants both of the Jews, and Gentiles for these outward dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, are comprehended in their parents, as the branch in the root, the infants of the godly in their parents, according to the tenor of his mercy, the infants of the wicked in their parents, according to the tenor of his justice: <hi>Master</hi> Blake <hi>pag.</hi> 8. <hi>more plainly,</hi> The branches of Ancestors are roots of posterity, being made a holy branch in reference to their issue, they now become a holy root.</q> This is not true, for in the Apostles resemblance, <hi>Abraham</hi> only is a holy root, or at most, <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> in whose names the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant runs. No other man, though a believer, is <hi>the father of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> but <hi>Abraham:</hi> And the body of believers is compared to the Olive, and each believer to a branch, <hi>that partakes of the root and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Olive tree,</hi> not in outward dispensations only, as you speak, but also in saving graces, which is mainly here intended. I remember Master <hi>Thomas Goodwin,</hi> who hath handled this matter of Pae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptisme, by spinning out similitudes and conjectures (fit indeed for the common people, that are more taken with resemblances then Syllogismes) rather then with close arguments: indeavoured to infer a kinde of promise of deriving holinesse from believers to their poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43338:38"/>
out of the similitude of an Olive, and its branches, compared with <hi>Psal.</hi> 128.3. &amp;c. but it is dangerous to strain similitudes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that likenesse the Holy Ghost makes. It is a tedious thing to Auditors that look for arguments, to be deluded with similitudes and conjectures.</p>
            <p>3. Whereas you alluding to the words of the Apostle, <hi>v.</hi> 28. that the Jews were <hi>beloved for their fathers sake,</hi> carry it, as if this were true of any believing parents; the Apostle meanes it of those fathers only, in whose names the Covenant was made, especially <hi>Abraham</hi> called <hi>the friend of God,</hi> Jam. 2.23. and <hi>the father of the faithfull,</hi> Rom. 4.11. and in reference to the promises made to them, they are beloved, and therefore it is added, ver. 29. <hi>For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</hi>

               </gap>at the sense wherein sanctification is taken for renovation of mind, is not here meant, for so an unbeliever is not sanctified, and the speech is <hi>in sensu composito,</hi> in a compound sense to be understood: An unbeliever, though an unbeliever, is sanctified. Nor is it true of any kind of Ceremoniall sanctification, or sanctification for enjoying religious ordinances; for such could not agree to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer. Therefore there remain only two senses, the one of an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentall sanctification,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> cals it, <hi>for the begetting a holy seed</hi>; The other of <hi>matrimoniall sanctification,</hi> whereby <hi>the one is enjoyed as a chaste yoke-fellow by another, without fornication. The former of these, your words intimate, you imbrace, when you say, the</hi>
               <q> unbelieving wife was sanctified in the believing husband, <hi>quoad hoc,</hi> so far as to bring forth a holy seed.</q> But against this are these reasons, 1. This could not have resolved the doubt in the case of those, who by age could not be sanctified to this end, or by reason of accidentall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability for generation, they might depart each from other, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this reason: whereas the Apostles resolution is, of all hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and wives; <hi>The unbelieving husband is sanctified,</hi> that is, every unbelieving husband is sanctified. If meant of Instrumentall sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, it were true only of those that are apt for generation, yea that do actu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lly generate: whereas the Apostles determination is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any husband or wife that were of different religion. 2. If the Apostle, by being sanctified, meant instrumentally sanctified to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a holy seed, then the reason had been thus: <hi>You may live together, for you may beget a holy seed.</hi> And so their consciences should have been resolved of their present lawfull living together, from a future event, which was uncertain; It had been taken from a thing contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, that might be, or not be: whereas the resolution is, by a reason taken from a thing certain, a thing present, or past; and therefore he useth the preterperfect tense, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>hath been sanctified</hi>; yea, in probability he speaks of a sanctification, even when both were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers:
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:43338:40"/>
for he saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> twice in the preterperfect tense, and he mentions the unbelieving, distinctly; but the believer, without the expression of his, or her faith, under the title of husband, or wife; and saith, your children, <hi>indiscriminatim,</hi> without difference, as well those you had before one of you was a believer, as since. However, it is manifest the Apostles reason is taken from a thing not contingent, but certain, not future, but present or past, and therefore not from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentall sanctification for the begetting of a holy seed, which was a future thing, and that contingent.</p>
            <p>This was so manifest to <hi>Chamier,</hi> that, <hi>tom.</hi> 4. <hi>Panstrat. Cathol. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 10. §. 46. he proves, that sanctification here cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of sanctification by conv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rsion of the unbeliever through the diligence of the wife, from this reason: <hi>Primum quia incerta ratio est, etsi enim nonnunquam ita factum, tamen plerumque etiam aliter,</hi> which I may apply to your instrumentall sanctification, in the same words. And after, <hi>In praeteritum dixit; sanctificatus est non autem sanctificabitur, rem jam constitutam, &amp; peractam non autem in futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum rem incertam, aut optandam, aut expectandam.</hi> 3. When any person is said to be instrumentally sanctified for a purpose, this san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification is ascribed to God, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Isa.</hi> 13.3. as selecting some from others to such an use, but here the sanctification is common to all unbelieving husbands in resp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ion, the words following could not be true, <hi>Else were your children uncleane, but now are they holy:</hi> For in this form of reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this Proposition is included. <hi>Their children could not be holy without that sanctification,</hi> but that had been false, understanding it of <hi>instrumentall sanctification</hi>; and of <hi>foederall,</hi> or of <hi>reall inherent personall</hi> holinesse. For their children might be in Covenant, and be regenerated, though their parents by reason of their unbeliefe had been neither of them sanct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>fied to the other, for the begetting of a holy seed. The children of Infidel-parents may be in the Covenant of grace, and be sanctified. It remaines then that the sanctification which I call matrimoniall, is here meant, which I expresse in <hi>Beza's</hi> words, thus: <hi>Fidelis uxor potest cum infideli marito bona conscientia consue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scere (cur enim aliena conscientia eam pollueret) idcirco dicitur infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis ille non in sese, sed in uxore (id est uxoris respectu) sanctus esse, idem quoque de altero membro judicandum est.</hi> That this may be the sense, I gather from the like use of the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:43338:41"/>
where the <hi>creature of God is said to be sanctified,</hi> that is, lawfully used, in opposition to that which is to be refused; so here, <hi>the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving husband is sanctified,</hi> that is, lawfully enjoyed as a husband, by, or to, or in respect of his wife, whether believer, or unbeliever, in this case there is no difference. And this your own words import, pag. 24. When you thus speake. <hi>He saith indeed, the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the believing husband, or to the believing husband; that is, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>sanctification,</hi> is the same with chastity, 1 Thess 4.7. So that the sense is, the <hi>unbelieving husband is sanctified to his wife,</hi> that is, lawfully or chastly, used as a husband, without fornication in respect of his own wife, whether believer or unbeliever, and therefore not to be refused. And this sense only serves for the purpose of the Apostle. The words are a reason why they might lawfully live together: the reason must be taken from that which was not contingent, but certain, as <hi>Chamier</hi> saith truly, <hi>tom.</hi> 4. <hi>Paustrat.

concerning circumcised or uncircumcised persons and servants, they might continue circumcised and uncircumcised persons and servants to their masters, notwithstanding their Christian calling, it did not dissolve those relations; so that to me it is very cleare, that the sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation here spoken of is matrimonial sanctification. As for instrument<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all sanctification, for the begetting a holy seed, I know not of any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr. <hi>Thomas Goodwin</hi> that hath so expounded it; But <hi>Beza</hi> and many others expound it of matrimoniall sanctification. Which is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmed in that the Apostle when he speakes of the believing party saith not the believing wife or husband, but <hi>the husband or wife,</hi> which is to me a plaine evidence, that the Apostle placeth the reason of their sanct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>fication, not in the faith of either party, but in the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of husband and wife. But of this more in the answering of your second argument. Now let this be granted (as of necessity it must) then the uncleannesse must be understood of bastardy, and the holines of legitimation; for no other holines follows necessarily to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in that their parents marriage is lawfull, and they borne of such parents, but legitimation nor any other uncleannes follows upon the denying of it but bastardy. And therefore who ever they be that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it of legitimation, they doe it rightly, call them how you will. And that I may cleare it, let the Apostles reason be resolved.</p>

               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:43338:45"/>This is indeed the principall reason that hath prevailed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, to interpret this passage of federall holinesse, not of matrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; because they conceive here is a priviledge ascribed to the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wife, or husband, in respect of the faith of the one person, not common to such with infidels. Whereas the holinesse here expressed is not from the quality of faith, but from the relation of husband and wife. For that onely was agreeable to the Apostles purpose: to assure them that in the disparity of religion they might live together still, because the unbeliever, though an unbeliever, notwithstanding his infidelity, is and hath been still lawfully injoyed and sanctified to his wife. So that the force of the Apostles reason is taken from the lawfulnesse of marriage amongst infidels. This was so plaine to <hi>Chamier. tom.</hi> 4. <hi>Panstr.

So that whereas you say, that upon the interpretation gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, it would follow that there would be no lawfull marriage amongst heathens, or legitimate children, because you conceive the sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; holinesse here proper to believers and their children, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:43338:46"/>
is most true, and most agreeable to the Apostles meaning, who doth not here ascribe the sanctification, either of the unbeliever, or the children, to the faith of either partie, but to the conjugall relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and mentions here no priviledge, but what was common to all married persons amongst the heathens. Thus is your principall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment answered; I passe on to the next.</p>
            <p>You say besides <q>S<hi>
                     <hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> Pauls reason had no strength in it, supposing the text were to be interpreted as these men would have it. Their doubt (say they) was that their marriage was an unlawfull wedlocke, and so consequently their children bast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rds.</q> You doe not herein rightly set downe your adversaries explication of the Apostle; the doubt was onely, whether the beleever might continue with the unbeliever in conjugall use: the Apostles resolution was they might, for they were sanctified each to other, notwithstanding the unbeliefe that was in the one partie; for if it were otherwise, their children were bastards. There was no doubt, as you say, of their childrens bastardy; the Apostles reason supposeth it was out of doubt with them. You adde. <q>Now marke what kinde of answer they make the Apostle give. Were you not lawfull man and wife, your children were bastards; but because the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband, &amp;c. because your marriage is a lawfull marriage, your children are legitimate. What strength of reason is in this? if this had been their doubt or question, whether their marriage were not a nullitie; the Apostle by his Apostolike authoritie, might have definitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly answered, without giving a reason, your marriage is good, and your children legitimate. But if Paul will goe about to satisfie them by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and prove them to be mistaken, it behoved him to give such a reason, which should have some weight in it, but this hath none. Set their doubt (as these men frame it) and the Apostles answer (as these men interpret it) together, and you will easily see the invalidity of it. Wee doubt (say the Corinthians) wee are not lawfull man and wife, and that therefore our children are bastards. No, saith Paul, you are mistaken, and I prove it thus; Were you not lawfull man and wife, your children were bastards, but because you are lawfull man and wife, your children are not bastards.</q> Is there any argument or proofe in this?</p>
            <p>As you frame your adversaries meaning, it may be thought ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, but your mistakes must not be charged on them for their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. All this passage of yours is built on this, that you make that the doubt which was not the doubt, to wit, whether their children
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:43338:46"/>
were bastards, and make that the conclusion, which is the <hi>medium</hi> to prove the conclusion by; for it was so far from being a doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their children were bastards, that the Apostle argues from this as an absurditie he knew they would not grant, and therefore suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed this to be without doubt with them, that their children were not bastards, but legitimate. And herein M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Thomas Goodwin</hi> spake right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>that the Apostle supposed it to be a received principle with them,</hi> though his paraphrase, but <hi>now are they holy, that is, you see your children bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,</hi> is his owne comment, and that not onely a very bold, but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd one, that I say no worse of it. And whereas you say, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle might by his Apostolike authoritie, have definitively answered, 'tis true, and so he did, as appeares from <hi>ver.</hi> 12. and yet he might give a reason <hi>ad homines, to the men,</hi> to convince them, which it may be, as you make it, is invalide, but rightly conceived, as the Apostle framed it, is convincing and cogent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You say.</hi>
               <q> Fourthly, according to this their interpretation, the Apostles answer could no way have reached to the quieting of their consciences; their doubt was whether according to the example in <hi>Ezra,</hi> they were not to put away their wives and children, as not belonging to God, as being a seed whom God would not owne among his people. Now what kinde of quiet would this have given them, to tell them that their children were not bastards? Wee know the <hi>Jewes</hi> did not put away their bastards, as not belonging to the Covenant of God, <hi>Pharez,</hi> and <hi>Zarah,</hi> and <hi>Jepthah,</hi> and innumerable others, though bastards, were circumcised, and not cut off from the people of God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>All this argument is grounded on a mistake, as if the question were, <hi>whether they were to put away their wives and children, as not belonging to God, and that according to the example in</hi> Ezra. Whereas that is but a conjecture, that they had any relation in this matter to the action mentioned in <hi>Ezra:</hi> and some other occasion is as likely, if not more likely, as hath been shewed, and it is certaine there were no doubts at all about the putting away of their children; for the Apostles ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument proceeds upon this as a thing undoubted with them, that their children were not uncleane, but holy. What their doubt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was, and how the Apostles answer fits it is shewed before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You goe on.</hi>
               <q> And whereas some object out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.2. that bastards did not belong to the Covenant among the Jewes, because God there forbad a bastard to come into the Congregation of the Lord. I answer, that is
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43338:47"/>
meant onely of bearing office in the Church, or some such like thing; and not of being under the Covenant belonging to the Church; as is manifest not onely by what hath been now said of <hi>Jepthah,</hi> and others, who were circumcised, and offered sacrifices, and drew nigh to God, as well as any other, but the very Text alledged gives sufficient light, that it cannot be meant otherwise, because in that place who ever is an Eunuch or wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his stones, hath the same exclusion from the Congregation of the Lord, and I hope that none will dare to say, that none such are holy to the Lord; if they should, the Scriptu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e is full enough against them; that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away in <hi>Ezra</hi> was of an higher nature then illegitimation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it behooved the Apostle to give another manner of satisfaction to their doubtfull consciences, then to tell them their children were not bastards: Therefore I conclude, that this holinesse being the fruit of one of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents being a believer, must be meant of some kinde of holinesse which is not common to the seed of them whose parents are both believers, and that is enough for our purpose.</q>
            </p>

I answer, indeed there would be weight in this Objection, if the Apostle had said, The unbelieving wife is sanctified, and no more, as he simply saith the children are holy; but that he doth not say: He saith indeed, the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the believing husband; <hi>or,</hi> to the believing husband, that is, to his use, as all other creatures are; as the bed he lies on, the meat he eats, the clothes he wears, the beast he rides on, are sanctified to him; and so this sanctifiednesse of the wife, is not a sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of state, but only of use, and of this use to be sanctified to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving husband, whereas the holinesse and sanctification that is spoken of the children is a holinesse of state, and not only a sanctification to the parents use.</q>

                  </gap>)</hi> for no man will say, the faith of the wife sanctifies the unbelieving husband federally, so that the unbelieving husband should be capable of Baptisme for the faith of the wife (which yet, with the leave of so great persons be it said, doth as well follow out of this place, as that the sonne is federally holy, and capable of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme for the faith of the parent). In which words, when I say, <hi>it follows out of this place,</hi> my meaning is, so translated and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as before; that the unbelieving husband is sanctified by, that is, by the faith of the wife, as the child is holy, it would follow, that the unbelieving husband should be in the Covenant as well as the child, and so be baptized: for the faith of the wife is said to sanctifie according to this reading and exposition, the one as well as the other. And so much I conceive you acknowledge, in saying
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43338:48"/>
in this Objection, there would be weight if the Apostle had said the unbelieving wife is sanctified and no more. But this only I put in by a parenthesis, as not building the main of the interpretation I gave on it, knowing that <hi>Beza</hi> renders it [<hi>in uxore,</hi> in the wife] and then the Objection hath no place. And seeing you do render [<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>] <hi>in,</hi> or <hi>to,</hi> and expound the sanctification to the believers use, as all other creatures are. I confesse, against you that Objection is not in force, and therefore your answer may be acknoweldged right in this particular. I passe to the second Objection.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That holinesse of the children is here meant, which could not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse one of the parents were sanctified to the other; which is the force of the Apostles arguing, the unbeliever is sanctified to the believer, else were not the children holy, but unclean; but federall holinesse of children may be where parents are not sanctified, one in, or to the other: as in bastardy. <hi>Davids</hi> childe by <hi>Bathsheba, Pharez</hi> and <hi>Zarah Judah's</hi> children by <hi>Thamar,</hi> the <hi>Israelites</hi> children by the Concubines, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> son <hi>Ishmael</hi> by <hi>Hagar,</hi> &amp;c. in which case the children were fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derally holy, and accordingly were circumcised, and yet the Harlot not sanctified, in, or to the Adulterer, or Fornicator, though a Believer.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Objection I own, having first proved that the santification of the unbeliever, is meant of lawfull conjugall copulation, only where you say, <hi>the unbeliever is sanctified to the believer,</hi> I would say as the Apostle doth, <hi>to the wife or husband.</hi> Now to this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you say, <hi>"I answer,</hi> but I pray you tell me where you answer it, I finde no answer to it here, except it be an answer to an Argument to deny the conclusion. In the Argument you neither shew faulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the form nor matter, which was the way of answering I learned in the Schools where I was bred. <hi>You say,</hi> 
               <q>we must at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Apostles scope:</q> true, but when we are to answer, we must attend to the Objection, and shew the weaknesse of it. <hi>You say,</hi> 
               <q>which is to shew, that the children would be unholy if the faith, or believership of one of the parents, could not remove the barre which lies in the other, being an unbeliever, against the producing of an holy seed, because one of them was a Pagan or unbeliever, therefore the childe could not be a holy seed, unlesse the faith or believership of the other parent could remove this barre.</q>
            </p>
            <p>You made the scope at first right, to resolve them whether they might lawfully retain their Infidell wives or husbands; but the scope
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43338:48"/>
you now give, is but a meer figment, not the Apostles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You say,</hi> 
               <q>now this can have no place of an argument in any case where one of the parents is not an Infidel.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I know not what you mean in this passage, unlesse it be you would answer thus; the Apostles scope is otherwise then the objector takes it, therefore he can make no argument, nor objection, and so I need not make any answer, which is a kinde of answering I am not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with.</p>
            <p>You go on: <q>But this was not the case amongst the <hi>Jews, Hagar</hi> and <hi>Thamar,</hi> and the concubines, however sinfull in those acts, yet themselves were Believers, belonging to the Covenant of God, and that barre lay not against their children, as it did in the unbelieving wife.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This passage is indeed a grant of the <hi>Minor</hi> in the objection, that children may be federally holy, where the one parent is not sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the other; and that the <hi>Major</hi> is true, which rests on this, that the children could not be holy, unlesse one parent were sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the other, you will not deny it; you do your self frame the force of the Apostles reason thus; both <hi>pag.</hi> 19. when you say, <hi>were it with them, as when both of them were unbelievers their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren would be an unclean progeny:</hi> and <hi>pag.</hi> 21. when you say, <hi>the Apostles answer had not been true, because then, if one of the parents had not been sanctified to his unbelieving wife, their children must have been bastards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In these and other passages, you acknowledge the force of the Apostles reason, to consist in this: that holinesse of the children is here meant, which could not be, unlesse one of the parents were sanctified to the other; wherefore the conclusion stands good, that the holinesse here is not federall holinesse.</p>
            <p>But you adde, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> a Sacrament or Seal of initiation, to be administred to them that enter into covenant with him, circumcision for the time of that administration, which was before Christs incarnation, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme since the time of his incarnation.</hi> But this is not all you would have granted; for it would stand you in no stead, and therefore, in stead of it, <hi>pag.</hi> 33. in the Repetition, you put this conclusion for your third; <hi>that our Baptisme succeeds in the room and use of their Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>; and your meaning is, that it so succeeds, <hi>that the command of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcising Infants should be virtually a command to baptize Infants,</hi> as you expresse your self, <hi>pag.</hi> 35. Now this I deny. That which you alledge for this is, First, the agreement that is between Cicumcision and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme: Secondly, the Text, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8, 9, 10, 11, 12. I shall examine both, and consider whether they fit your purpose.</p>
            <p>You confesse <hi>they differ in the outward Elements,</hi> and that is enough to shew that the command for the one, is not a command for the other, except the Holy Ghost do so interpret it. But you say, they agree in five or six particulars. The first, <hi>that they are both of them the same Sacrament for the spirituall part</hi>; which is to be granted, but with its due allowance: For, though Baptisme signifie in part the same thing that Circumcision did; namely, sanctification by the spirit, justification and salvation by Jesus Christ, and faith in him; yet it is true that there is a vast difference betwixt them, because Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision signified these things as to be from Christ to come, and therefore it was a sign of the promise of Christ to come from <hi>Isaac</hi>; but Baptisme signifies these things in the name of Christ already ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested in the flesh, crucified, buried, and risen again. And because Circumcision did signifie Christ to come out of <hi>Isaac,</hi> therefore it did also confirm all the promises that were made to <hi>Abrahams</hi> naturall Posterity, concerning their multiplying, their bringing out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> their settling in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the yoak of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> which was to be in force <hi>till Faith came,</hi> that is, till Christ was manifested in the flesh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19.23, 24, 25. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2, 3.</p>
            <p>The second agreement you make, is that <hi>both are appointed to be
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43338:50"/>
distinguishing signes betwixt Gods people and the Devils people.</hi> This must be also warily understood; for though it be true they are both d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And in the signes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves there is a great difference, both in the acting of them; the one of them was with blood, the other without; the one took away a part of the body, the other not: and after the acting, the one was a permanent signe, the other left no impression or footsteps of it that did remain.</p>
            <p>The third agreement is, <hi>both of them the way and means of solemn entrance and admission into the Church,</hi> which may be granted; yet in the solemnity there was a great difference: the one to be done in a private house, by a private person, the other openly by the Minister thereto appointed.</p>
            <p>The fourth agreement is, <hi>both of them to be administred but once,</hi> which I conceive true thus; to wit, that there is no necessity of administring either of them above once; but a demonstrative Argument to prove it an heresie, or unlawfull in it self to rebaptize, I yet expect. Yet this parity hath its disparity: For Baptisme is not restrained to any set day, but Circumcision was limited to the eighth day in its institution.</p>
            <p>Your fifth, <hi>And none might be received into the communion of the Church of the</hi> Jewes, <hi>untill they were circumcised, nor into the communion of the Church of the</hi> Christians, <hi>untill they be baptized.</hi> If you mean by Communion to be accounted members of the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> I cannot assent unto you: For not only the children were accounted in that Church who were not eight dayes old, but also all the uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised in the time of the travell through the Wildernesse, untill they cam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to <hi>Gilgal,</hi> and all the females were members, though they were not to be circumcised. The reason was, because God would have all within that Church that were within the families of <hi>Israel</hi>; and therefore he would have the servants born in the house, and that were bought with money of any stranger that were not of <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, circumcised. And if you mean by the communion of the Church of <hi>Christians,</hi> the accounting of them as visible members, it is not true that none might be received into the communion of the Church of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43338:50"/>
the <hi>Christians</hi> untill they be baptized, unlesse you will with <hi>Bellarmine</hi> deny the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> to be actuall members of the Church, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>Whitaker,</hi> and others of the Protestant Divines herein.</p>
            <p>The last agreement is, that <hi>none but the circumcised might eat of the Pasch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

If he come without examination of himself, not discerning the Lords bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, he sins, he breaks the command, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28.

As the Priest by offering the sacrifices held forth Christ to them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. so the Minister by preaching, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. As the Priest was for the people of God, so the Minister of the Gospel: As the High Priest was to have the people on his breast, so the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in his heart; as the one was to blesse, so the other was to pray for them: As the Priest had a consecration, so the Minister is to have an ordination: As none was to thrust himself into the one without a calling; so neither in the other: And many more such agreements might be assigned; will it therefore follow, that a command to a Priest to offer a sacrifice propitiatory, is a command to a Minister to offer a sacrifice propitiatory, or a command for a Priest to wear a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen Ephod, should be a command to a Minister to wear a Surplice, as the <hi>Papists</hi> do just in your manner argue from Analogy or resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance; or, that therefore tythes are due to Ministers, <hi>jure divino,</hi> by divine appointment, as Bishop <hi>Carleton,</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Sclater,</hi> and others, from Analogy of <hi>Melchisedecs</hi> and <hi>Aarons</hi> Priesthood would infer: or that ordination may be by the people; because the children of <hi>Israel</hi> laid hands on the <hi>Levites,</hi> as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mather</hi> in answer to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Herle</hi>; or that there must be an imparity in the Clergy, and so Bishops above Presbyters, as the Prelates, <hi>Bilson, Daven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Supper, but it is but our collection, that thereby the Lord would make an end of the Passeover, and substitute the other in its room. In other places we rather finde the Lords Supper to answer the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, and the Rock, or water out of the Rock in the Wildernesse, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3, 4. It is true, the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16, 17. argues from the eating of the sacrifices to the eating of the Lords Supper. But that was not only from the Passeover, but from the rest of the peace-offerings as well as it; yea, from the <hi>Heathens</hi> feasts upon their sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. It is true, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. we are required to keep the feast, and the allusion is to the Paschal Supper; but whether the keeping the feast be meant of the Lords Supper, or as <hi>Beza</hi> paraphraseth it, <hi>totam vitam in justitia &amp; integritate consumamus, let us spend our whole life in justice and integrity,</hi> or something else, <hi>sub judice lis est,</hi> is a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie undetermined. But let it be granted, that the Lords Supper imitates (I will not say succeeds into the room of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Passeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, for that was a sacrifice, and Christ offered, is only in stead of it) the Paschal Supper, which because of the time, and the form of words used in the institution, and such like circumstances, is very probable, and therefore there is great Analogy between them; yet he that should argue, therefore we must receive the Lords Supper with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened bread, as the <hi>Papists</hi>; or that the bread and wine must be first consecrated on an Altar, as was the Paschal Lamb; or that the Lords Supper is not to be administred but in a Church, gathered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Church-way, as the Elders of <hi>New-England,</hi> in answer to the nine Positions; or that we must keep an <hi>Easter,</hi> and then have the Lords Supper, as in ancient and later times hath been conceived, you would reject these things as ill gathered, and perhaps call them superstitious. But whether these, and more like to them, do not as well follow, as baptizing of Infants, from circumcision of Infants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their Analogy, I leave to your self to consider. You adde, <hi>And this our Lord himself taught us by his own example, who was cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised as a professed member of the Church of the</hi> Jews, <hi>and when he set up the new Christian Church, he would be initiated into it by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptisme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is confessed, that Christ was circumcised and baptized, but that it was to teach us by his example, either your conclusion, or the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments between Baptisme and Circumcision which you set down, or that which next goes before your speech, the succession of the Lords Supper to the Passeover, remains yet to be proved, much more that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43338:52"/>
which you drive at, that there is such a parity, or rather identity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Baptisme and Circumcision, that the command to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise Infants, is a command to baptize Infants. The circumcision of Christ was undoubtedly as his presenting in the Temple, and the offering for him to accomplish the Law, under which it pleased him <hi>to be made of a woman, Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5. and it had a spirituall use to assure our circumcision <hi>in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, Col.</hi> 2.11. This is certain, we have cleare Scripture for it; if you shall shew the like Scriptures for the inferences you make from Christs circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I shall imbrace them with both arms. The Baptisme of Christ was that Christ might <hi>fulfill all righteousnesse, Mat.</hi> 3.15. But how to expound this speech, hath not a little difficulty. Various conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures there are about the meaning of it: this seems to me most like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that righteousnesse is there taken for that which was appointed by God, either in secret instructions, or some particular Prophecy from God. But then if it be asked why God did appoint it, this seems most likely, sith it is plain that this was the time of Christs anointing with the Spirit, as appears, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. that Baptisme was used to signifie his anointing by the Spirit for his great function he was then to enter on, which me thinks, the story it self, and the speech of <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 10.37, 38. do evince. That which you say, <hi>That being to set up the new Christian Church, he would be initiated into it by the Sacrament of Baptisme,</hi> seems not probable; partly, because Christ did not set up in his own dayes on earth a visible Church, Discipline and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship distinct from the <hi>Jewish</hi>; partly, because his Baptisme was of a far higher nature then our Baptisme, <hi>Who was anointed with the oyl of gladnesse above his fellows, Heb.</hi> 1.9. and therefore his Baptisme was of a transcendent nature above ours. But if it were granted that Christs Baptisme were to teach us, that he that is a member of the Church, must be initiated by baptisme, it will rather disadvantage your cause then advantage it, sith Christ, who was <hi>the holy One of God, and the Angel of the Covenant, and the seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>in whom all the nations of the earth should be blessed, to whom the promises were made, in whom the Covenant was confirmed,</hi> Gal. 3.16, 17. yet was not baptized, <hi>till he began to be about thirty yeers of age,</hi> Luke 3.23. So that you see how little help you have from your parities, or Christs example to prove a like reason of circumcising and baptizing Infants. But you have yet another string to your bow, out of <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12. I will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you to try the strength of that also.</p>

            <p>It is necessary that I should first consider in what sense your <hi>Position</hi> is to be taken, before I examine your proof for it. The thing that you say the Apostle makes plain, is <hi>that the Sacrament of Baptisme doth succeed in the room, place, and use of Circumcision:</hi> Succession properly notes a coming after another, as we say, Kings succeed one another, High priests one after another. To speak exactly, Baptisme (I do not say the Sacrament of Baptisme) was a concomitant of Circumcision, if not ancienter; For it is well known, that Baptisme was in use among the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the initiating of Proselytes for many yeers together with circumcision, as may be seen in <hi>Selden, de jure naturali, &amp; gentium jux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta discipl. Heb.</hi> lib. 2. cap. 2, 3, 4. <hi>Ainsworth Annot.</hi> on Gen. 17. There is much of this in many Authors beside. But I suppose you cannot be ignorant of what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> hath in his Sermon, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled <hi>Elias Redivivus,</hi> pag. 11. where he makes it as ancient as <hi>Jacob. Gratius Annot.</hi> in Mat. 3.6. hath these words: <hi>Cum verò peregri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni abluti &amp; non circumcisi solis legibus tenerentur, quos Deus toti ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum generi dederat, intellectu facile est ablutionem hanc fuisse inter vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra instituta orta, ut arbitror, post magnum diluvium in memoriam purgati mundi: unde illud celebre apud Graecos, <gap reason="foreign">

But let it be granted it suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, that is, comes after Circumcision, sith it continues now circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision is taken away, yet the sense in which you can rightly make it <hi>succeed into the room, place, and use of Circumcision,</hi> will be brought into a narrow room, too strait to settle Baptisme of Infants in it.</p>
            <p>Room and place are properly either the same, or differ only as <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus communis &amp; proprius,</hi> common place and proper; so Baptisme, which is an action, hath no place or room properly. If you mean by the room and place, the subjects to be baptized, or baptizing, it is not true, except in part; some of the baptized and baptizers only were circumcised, and to be circumcised; some that were not to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, as women, were to be baptized. If you mean by the room and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43338:53"/>
place the society into which both persons were to be initiated, it is not true: For by the Sacrament of Baptisme, persons were to be baptized into the Christian Church, by Circumcision into the Jewish, as your own Conclusion saith. If you mean it of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment upon which both are seated, neither is that true: the commandement of Circumcision was many age<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> before Baptisme was instituted as a Sacrament. And for the succession into the use of Circumcision, that is yet more untrue. Your self say a few lines af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>The use of Circumcision engaged men to the use of the rest of the Jewish Ceremonies.</hi> And page 29. <hi>It is true indeed, that circumcision bound them who received it, to conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rm to that manner of administration of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> &amp;c. And if you had not confessed it, it might have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2, 3. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. from the custome in circumcising Proselytes, to bind them to the Lawes, not only common to all the <hi>Noachidae,</hi> but also to all the Laws of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as <hi>Selden, ubi supra, Ainsworth</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. But I hope you will not dare to say, that Baptisme succeeds Circumcision in this use, if it do, then are we still bound to keep the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> Another use of Circumcision, was to signifie Christ to come out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, I think you will not deny it; if you should, I might plead against you, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the institution of it to be in the males only of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> family, by whom the Genealogy was to be reckoned, in the member for generation, the expressions of the Covenant confirmed by it, and the consent of innumerable learned men, both of the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi>: And I think you will not say, Baptisme succeeds into this use of Circumcision: Another use of it was to be a partition wall between the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to distinguish and divide them, whence the one were counted unclean, as uncircumcised, the other clean, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.11.14. but you will not say, that Baptisme succeeds into this use, sith the use of Baptisme is to the contra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26, 27, 28. and surely these were the main uses of it. But you will say, there was use of circumcision for initiation into the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and so of Baptisme. But then, though Baptisme do initiate as Circumcision, yet not into the same Church: For Circumcision did not initiate into any Church, but into the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or rather into the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Abraham</hi>; but so doth not Baptisme. If it be said, that the one confirms the Covenant, and so doth the other; still I answer, that Baptisme doth not confirm the same Covenant in every part that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision did: For the Covenant was a mixt Covenant, a great part
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43338:53"/>
whereof Baptisme doth not confirm. This is all that can be said, that they agree in that, as circumcision did confirm the spirituall part of the Covenant, to wit, righteousnesse by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied holinesse of heart; so doth also Baptisme, the like whereof did the Cloud, Sea, Manna, the water out of the Rock, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2, 3, 4. the Deluge or Ark, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. the sprinkling of the blood of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices; and the same are confirmed by the Lords Supper; and why then should we not say, that Baptisme succeeds the flood, sprinkling of blood, as well as Circumcision; and that the Lords Supper suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds Circumcision as well as Baptisme? Wherefore I conceive your Proposition so generally delivered, <hi>That the Sacrament of Baptisme succeeds into the room, place, and use of Circumcision,</hi> erroneous and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous. But how ever you think, the thing is plainly delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8, 9, 10, 11, 12. let us examine that Text then.</p>
            <p>You say thus: <q>Where the Apostles scope is to disswade the believing Christians from the rudiments of the world, and Jewish ceremonies and observations upon this ground, that we are compleat in Christ, and that in him, as in the head, the Church hath all perfections.</q> All this is very right, and the thing very well expressed by <hi>Beza, Addendum fuit istud ut non tantum sibi, &amp; in sese, sed in nostrum etiam usum statuatur Christus esse talis &amp; tantus, ut nihil in ipso desideretur, &amp; in eo uno omnia nancis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camur ad veram, &amp; salvificam Dei notitiam requisita: Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Annot.</hi> in <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10. where mark that <hi>Beza</hi> rightly makes us so compleat in Christ, that there is no need of any thing added out of Christ in stead of those ceremonies. You go on; <q>and because he would take them whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly off from Circumcision, the use whereof engaged them to the use of the rest of Jewish ceremonies; he tells them that in Christ we are circumcised with circumcision made without hands, a better circumcision then the <hi>Jews</hi> was, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ.</q> You say rightly: First, <hi>that the Apostle would take them off wholly from circumcision,</hi> therefore not teach them that they had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ordinance in stead of it, by vertue of that command: Secondly, <hi>That the use of circumcision, ingaged them to the use of the rest of the Jewish ceremonies,</hi> and therefore that Baptisme succeeds not in the use of Circumcision: Thirdly, <hi>In Christ we are circumcised with a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision made without hands, a better circumcision then the</hi> Jews <hi>was, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ,</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:43338:54"/>
and therefore we have circumcision not in another Ordinance, but in Christ and his circumcision. You go on; <hi>and whereas the Jewish teachers would be ready to object, that the receiving of the inward grace of circumcision, did not make them so compleat as</hi> Abraham, <hi>and his seed was, because they also had an outward sensible signe whereby they might be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perswaded, comforted and confirmed.</hi> This is but a conceit that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Jews</hi> were ready thus to object, or the Apostle intended to answer such an objection. The intent of the Apostle is to declare in what way and manner, and by what means they became compleat in Christ, <hi>to wit,</hi> Baptisme and Faith, whereby they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Christ, and so were compleat in him. But you say, <q>To this he answers, <hi>vers.</hi> 12. that neither is this priviledge wanting to <hi>Christians</hi> who have as excellent and expresse a Sacrament of it, being buried with Christ in Baptisme; the effect whereof he there sets down, and therefore they needed not circumcision as their false teachers insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, thereby directly teaching that our Baptisme is in stead of their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision.</q> It is true, the Apostle teacheth them that they needed not circumcision, but not because they had Baptisme in lieu of it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all was in Christ now, who hath abolished all these rites, or <hi>taken them away quite,</hi> vers. 14. <hi>as being but shadows of good things to come, and the body is of Christ,</hi> vers. 17. in whom, and in that which befell him all was accomplished. And <hi>Aretius</hi> therefore in his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> on <hi>Colos.</hi> 2. saith rightly in this; <hi>not a rem ipsam vindicari sanctis sine externo symbolo; quod tamen indesinenter urgebant advers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the Apostles intent is plain, to shew, that Christ is in stead of Circumcision, and all the rest of the Jewish ceremonies. and the truth is by this doctrine, that Baptisme is in stead of Circumcision, the Apostles argument for the disanulling the Jewish ceremonies, both here, and <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9. &amp; 10.1. &amp; 13. in the Epistle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> chap. 3. &amp; 4. and <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. is quite evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who still useth this argument to prove the abolition of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the Law, because they have their complement in Christ,

not in some new Ordinance added in stead of them; for if there be need of other Ordinances (besides Christ) in stead of the old, then Christ hath not in himself fulnesse enough to supply the want of them, and this abolition is not because of Christs fulnesse, but other Ordinances that come in stead of the abolished. And indeed, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme and the Lords Supper, though they be Ordinances of Christ that may imitate or resemble the Ordinances of the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said they succeed into the roome, place, or use of them: For Christ only, and that which he did, doth so succeed: So that if things be well weighed, this Text is against your Position, not for it, and so your Ordinance is turned against you. You go on; <q>And the Analogy lies between two sacramentall types of the same substance <hi>[regeneration]</hi> to both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
               </q> I deny not but that there is Analogy between Circumcision and Baptisme, and so there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Deluge and <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark, or deliverance from the Deluge and Baptisme, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. they do resemble each other in some things.

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This is said with more confidence, then truth: For another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is plain from the context; that therefore Baptisme is named, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is one of the means by which Christians come to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Christ, and to be compleat in him, which was the thing the Apostle intended in the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verse, and therefore he joynes faith with Baptisme, they being the two speciall means whereby we come to have communion with Christ, and to be compleat in him. And this is further confirmed by comparing this with other Scriptures: <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.25, 26, 27. the Apostle speaks thus: <hi>But after faith is come, we are no longer under a Schoolmaster,</hi> meaning <hi>Circumcision,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For we are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus: For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ</hi>; which Text is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently answerable to <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8, 9, 10, 11, 12. And again, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4, 5. <hi>Know you not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into his death? therefore are we buried with him, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by baptisme into death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead, by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newnesse of life: For if we have been planted together in the likenesse of his death, we shall be also in the likenesse of his resurrection.</hi> In which places you may easily perceive, that by putting on Christ, we come to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the Schoolmaster, that is, the Law, and so from Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision; that being planted into Christ, we walk in newnesse of life, that is, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6. that <hi>now we are delivered from the Law, that being dead wherein we were held, that we should serve in newnesse of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and not in the oldnesse of the letter</hi>; and that the means hereof, is by Baptisme by which we put on Christ, and are baptized into his death, and by faith, whereby we are no longer children under age, but sons come to their inheritance. Thus have I at last, waded through your third Conclusion, and the Text, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12. the misunderstanding of which hath been the <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> foolish fire, which hath led men out of the way in this matter into bogs.</p>

            <p>They that thus object, speak that which is truth, only whereas you make the objectors say, <hi>That it was not a seal of the spirituall part of the covenant of Grace,</hi> I would say, <hi>to all that were circumcised</hi>; and when you say, <hi>but as a nationall badge,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that</hi> Ishmael <hi>was circumcised for some temporall respects,</hi> I would leave out those words, and say, <hi>because God commanded it.</hi> Thus did I expresse my self in my <hi>Latin</hi> paper, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>that not right to Euangelicall promises,</hi> I now adde, <hi>nor right to any other benefit by the Covenant made with</hi> Abraham, <hi>was the proper and adequate reason, why these, or those were circumcised, but Gods Precept: For as much as persons were to be circumcised, who had no right, either to the Euangelicall promises, or any other in that Covenant which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by circumcision; and I named</hi> Ishmael, <hi>concerning whom, though God heard</hi> Abraham <hi>in giving him some blessing upon</hi> Abrahams <hi>prayer, when he understood the promise was not intended for</hi> Ishmael, <hi>but to</hi> Isaac, Gen. 17.19, 20. <hi>yet he expresly added his determination to hold,</hi> vers. 21. <hi>that he would establish his Covenant with</hi> Isaac, <hi>not with</hi> Ishmael: <hi>and on the other side, all the females in the Covenant were uncircumcised, though some of them had right to all the promises in the Covenant; and the Text expresly makes the reason of what</hi> Abraham <hi>did to be Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>

v. 23. <hi>and no other.</hi> Wherefore those that say, that Circumcision did not seal the spirituall part of the Covenant of Grace to all, and that <hi>Ishmael</hi> was not by circumcision brought under the Covenant of Grace, say no more, then what the Apostle saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6, 7, 8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.28, 29. and your self, <hi>pag.</hi> 13. where you say, <hi>only true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are made partakers of the spirituall part of the Covenant.</hi> Now the end of this objection, is to prove that it followes not, because a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was appointed to be circumcised, therefore he was within the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, or that because persons were within the Covenant of Grace, therefore they were to be circumcised. Let us now see what you answer to this. You say, <q>I answer there is nothing plainer, then that the Covenant, whereof Circumcision was a signe, was the Covenant of Grace.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is granted, that the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. was the Covenant of Grace, though not a pure Covenant, but a mixt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. But what then? Doth it follow, that every one that was cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised, was in the Covenant of Grace? It is true, the sacrifices did confirm the Covenant in Christs blood; but it doth not follow, that all that did offer sacrifices were partakers of the Covenant. The like may be said of Baptisme, the Lords Supper, Manna, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they that did partake of, yet were not all of them in the Covenant, as the Apostle shews, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.18, 19. It is one thing to be under the outward administration, another thing to be in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace. This is proper only to elect persons, the other is common to Elect and Reprobate, and depends meerly on Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment without any other consideration. <hi>You go on,</hi> 
               <q>Abraham received circumcision, a signe of the righteousnesse of Faith:</q> Very true, and the Apostle expoundeth this, when he saith, <hi>which he had, yet being uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, though they be not circumcised, that righteousnesse might be imputed to them also,</hi> Rom. 4.11. So that the Apostle makes <hi>Circumcision a seal of righteousnesse,</hi> but not to all, or only circumcised persons, but <hi>to all believers,</hi> whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles</hi>; so that according to the Apostles doctrine, <hi>Circumcision,</hi> in as much as it sealed to <hi>Abraham</hi> the righteousnesse of faith, which he had, being yet uncircumcised, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a seal to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that believe of the righteousnesse of faith, though they be never circumcised. So that it is so far from being true, that persons have the promise, therefore they must have the seal in their persons; that it followes, persons have the promise, therefore they
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:43338:56"/>
have the seal in <hi>Abraham,</hi> though they never are, nor may be sealed in their own persons. <hi>You go on,</hi> 
               <q>and the <hi>Jewes</hi> received it not as a Nation, but as a Church, as a people separated from the world, and taken into covenant with God.</q> If you take [<hi>as</hi>] with reduplication, it is true, <hi>that neither the</hi> Jewes <hi>received circumcision as a Nation,</hi> for then every nation should receive it, <hi>nor as a Church or people separated from the world, and taken into covenant with God,</hi> for then every Church or people separated from the world, and taken into cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God should receive circumcision, which is false, but they received it as appointed them from God, under this formall reason, and no other. But what is all this to the answering the objection, <hi>That it was not the seal of the spirituall part of the Covenant of Grace to all circumcised persons, and that circumcision was appointed to persons not under the Covenant of Grace, and that the reason why persons were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, was not because they were under the covenant of Grace, but only Gods appointment?</hi> But you yet adde, <q>It is true indeed that circumcision bound them who received it to conform to that manner of administration of the covenant which was carried much by a way of temporall blessings and punishments, they being types of spirituall things.</q> It is right which you grant, that <hi>circumcision bound them who received it to conform to that manner of administration of the covenant,</hi> but then it is to be considered, that circumcision was a part of this administration; and that though temporall blessings, as of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and rest in it, were sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the rest of Gods people, and so in a sort of administrations of the covenant of Grace, yet they were also part of the things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in the covenant made to <hi>Abraham</hi>; and when you say, <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision bound them who received it, to conform to that manner of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the covenant which was carried much by a way of temporall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings and punishments</hi>; it is hard to shew in what sense they were bound to conform to temporall blessings and punishments: they were bound to conform to the sacrifices and offerings, and washings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For these were their acts to be done by them, but how they were bound to conform to the administration by temporall blessings and punishments, it is hard to understand, sith they were Gods acts, not theirs. <hi>You adde,</hi> 
               <q>but no man can ever shew, that any were to receive the Sacrament of Circumcision, in relation to those outward things only, or to them at all, further then they were administrations of the Covenant of Grace.</q> The truth is, no man was to receive the Sacrament of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision in relation to these outward things only, or to them at all,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:43338:57"/>
either as they were temporall blessings or types of spirituall things, and so, as you speak, <hi>administrations of the covenant of Grace,</hi> but in this respect only, and for this reason, and no other, <hi>because God had so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi>; though I deny not circumcised persons were by faith to look on the covenant of Grace through these administrations, yet the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of being circumcised was barely Gods command; so that if you abstract <hi>Gods command,</hi> notwithstanding the covenant, or any other administration of it, they were not to be circumcised: You go on: <q>Sure I am, the proselytes and their children could not be circumcised in any relation at all to the temporall blessings of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as they were temporall, because notwithstanding their circumcision, they were not capable of receiving or purchasing any inheritance at all in the land, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journe they might as other strangers also did, but the inheritance of the land, no not one foot of it could ever be alienated from the severall Tribes to whom it was distributed, as their Possession by the most High: For all the land was divided into twelve Tribes, and they were not any one of them allowed to sell their lands, longer then till the yeer of Jubilee, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. v. 3. &amp;c. Yea, I m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y, that their circumcision was so far from sealing to them the outward good things of the land, that it occasioned and tyed them to a greater expence of their temporall blessings, by their long and frequent and chargeable journyes to worship at <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi>
               </q> This which you say may be granted, and the thing which you would prove by it, <hi>That they which received circumcision, did not receive it in relation only to these outward things,</hi> yet this overthrows not this Proposition, <hi>That the covenant made with</hi> Abraham <hi>had promises of temporall blessings, and that some were to be circumcised, who had no part in the covenant of Grace.</hi> You adde: <q>And as for what was alledged con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Ishmael,</hi> the Answer is easie; God indeed there declares, that <hi>Isaac</hi> should be the Type of Christ, and that the covenant of Grace should be established, and continue in his family, yet both <hi>Ishmael</hi> and the rest of <hi>Abrahams</hi> family were really taken into covenant untill afterwards by apostasie they discovenanted themselves, as also did <hi>Esau</hi> afterwards, though he were the son of <hi>Isaac,</hi> in whose family God had promised the covenant should continue.</q> When you say, <hi>that</hi> Ishmael <hi>was really taken into the covenant,</hi> meaning, <hi>of Grace,</hi> mentioned in a few words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, you oppose both the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.7, 8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.28, 29. as I have shewed before, and Gods own speech, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.19, 20. To which I may adde, that <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> only are said to be <hi>coheirs with</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>of the same promise,</hi> Heb. 11.9. And when you say, <hi>that he and</hi> Esau
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:43338:57"/>
               <hi>were discovenanted by apostasie:</hi> you plainly deliver <hi>apostasie from the covenant of Grace,</hi> which I will not call in you <hi>Arminianisme,</hi> but in others it would, and that justly be so censured. But you will say, you <hi>mean that</hi> Ishmael <hi>and</hi> Esau <hi>were</hi> Abrahams <hi>seed by profession, and outward cleaving to the covenant,</hi> as you speak, <hi>pag.</hi> 14. But this is not <hi>to be taken into the covenant of Grace really,</hi> as you speak; for taking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally into the covenant of Grace, is Gods act, either of election<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, or some act executing either of these; but profession and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cleaving to the covenant is mans act; and therefore, how to salve your speech I know not. As for the objection, I see not that you have answered it, but that still it stands good, <hi>that persons were to be circumcised, who were not in the covenant of Grace, that</hi> Ishmael <hi>was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be circumcised, though it were declared Gods covenant did not belong to him; and therefore the reason of circumcising persons, was not the covenant of Grace, but only the will and command of God to have it so.</hi> Your fifth Conclusion followes.</p>

               <note place="margin">§. 11. <hi>Of the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers under the Gospel, and whether the want of Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme be want of a priviledge of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace which the</hi> Jews <hi>had.</hi>
               </note>
               <q>FIfthly, and lastly, the priviledges of Believers under this last and best administration of the covenant of Grace, are many wayes inlarged, made more honourable and comfortable then ever they were in the time of the <hi>Jews</hi> administration.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Conclusion, with its Explication and Application, have all their vigour in ambiguity of speech; as the strength of the Coney is in its burrow; which, that I may uncover, I must distinctly declare, what is to be held in this matter, and then examine what you say. Priviledge is a Law term, the Etymologie is, <hi>Privilegium quasi priva lex, quia veteres priva dixerunt, quae nos singula dicimus: Priviledge, as it were a private law, because the ancients called those things private, which we call singular,</hi> Gel. noct. Attic. lib. 10. cap. 20. <hi>Joh. Calvinus Wett.</hi> in his Lexicon Juridicum voce privilegium. <hi>Privilegium alii sic definiunt, jus singulare in certae personae gratiam favoremve, others so define a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, a singular right in favour of a certain person</hi>; so that a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is a particular law, whereby some persons have benefit diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from common right. <hi>Calvin</hi> ibid. <hi>Item beneficium dicitur privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legium quia benè facit iis quibus conceditur contra legem communem, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a priviledge is called a benefit, because it benefits those to whom it is granted, against the common law.</hi> If it do not benefit, it is not a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; Priviledges therefore may be priviledges at one time, which are not at another time: and in comparison of some which are not
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:43338:58"/>
priviledges in comparison of others. To have Christ personally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with the Disciples, was a priviledge for the time, but it was a priviledge that he was absent, when he went to heaven, and sent his Spirit to them: The Lawes delivered to the <hi>Jews</hi> were priviledges in comparison of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> but not in comparison of <hi>Christians.</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the covenant of Grace may be conceived, either in respect of the substance of the covenant of Grace, or the administration. Now, when you speak of priviledges of the covenant of Grace, some passages s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>em to mean it in respect of the promises of grace in Christ, as when you say, <hi>Our covenant is established upon better promises, we as well as they are called a holy nation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>not only in the clearnesse of the administration, but also,</hi> &amp;c. And those especially which you have when you say, <hi>pag.</hi> 31. <hi>We are inquiring for priviledges, which are bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Covenant of Grace, which every man that is in covenant with God, may expect from God, by vertue of the Covenant,</hi> which cannot be understood but of the promises. Now the promises of the covenant of Grace, are of the substance of the covenant, not of the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But other passages refer to the administration. <hi>That yoak, that hard and costly way of administration, which neither they nor their fathers were able to bear, is taken off from our shoulders, the glory of theirs had no glory in respect of ours, they were under the bondage of Infants under age, in comparison of our freedome</hi>; which things belong to the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration, <hi>pag.</hi> 10.12. Now, if you mean your conclusion of privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the substance of the covenant of Grace, it is to be denied: For so the <hi>priviledges of believers are not now inlarged many wayes, or made more honourable or comfortable.</hi> Your self, <hi>pag.</hi> 9.10.12. say, <hi>they are the same to both</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Gentiles: but in respect of the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>it is granted they are many wayes inlarged, made more honourable</hi>; and in this sense, I grant it, <hi>that many Scriptures speak of the inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our priviledges, and particularly, those that speak of the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the hard yoak,</hi> Acts 15.10. <hi>and bringing us into liberty to full age,</hi> Gal. 4.1. <hi>and greater glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.10. And it is true that those things were priviledges to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> but it is a benefit to us, that we are freed from them, and so no priviledge for us, either to have them or any other thing in lieu of them, but Christ already come, who is in stead of all. Now the thing that you drive at, is this: that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you conceive that you have proved before, <hi>that the Infants of those that are in the covenant of Grace, are covenanters with their parents; that Baptisme succeeds in the roome and use of their circumcision, that by Gods
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43338:58"/>
expresse order, Infants were to be circumcised.</hi> You lastly conclude, <hi>that our priviledges for our selves and children, are at least as honourable, large and comfortable, as theirs, and therefore our Infants are to be baptized.</hi> The answer to it is this: It is true, our priviledge is the same with theirs in respect of the substance of the covenant, but neither was that made to the <hi>Jews</hi> naturall posterity as such, nor is it made to ours. As for Circumcision, it was indeed a priviledge, but belonging to the manner of administration not to the substance of the covenant which is in variable, a priviledge to the <hi>Jews</hi> in comparison of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> but a burthen in comparison of us; and it is so far from being a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to our children, that they should have either it or any other thing in the place and use of it, but Christ manifested in the flesh, that the truth is, it is a great priviledge to us and our children, that they have neither it, nor any other thing in the stead of it but Christ mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested in the flesh: And so parents loose nothing by denying Baptism to Infants in the place &amp; use of circumcision; but it is indeed, if right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered, a benefit to them to want it, God not appointing it, nor making a promise of grace to be confirmed by it to the Infants of Believers. Having premised this, I shall examine the proofs of your conclusion, and see whether they make any thing against that which I have delivered. The thing you should prove, is one of these two: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that circumcision did belong to the substance of the covenant of Grace, or, that the want of Circumcision, or some Ordinance in the place and use of it, is a losse of priviledge of the covenant of Grace to us and our children. That which you alledge is this: <q>Many Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures speak of the inlargement of their priviledges, not one for the dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing or depressing or extenuating of them; that yoak, that hard and costly way of administration, which neither they nor their fathers were able to bear, is taken off from our shoulders.</q> True, and by this, you yeeld that it may be an inlargement of priviledge to have somewhat removed that was a priviledge formerly. The Scripture to which you allude, is that, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. Now I pray you, what was this yoak, but cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, as your self declare, <hi>pag.</hi> 39. and all the legall ceremonies which were great priviledges to the <hi>Jews</hi>; but yet to us it is a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that we are freed from them, and if it be a priviledge to be fre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> from circumcision, it is a priviledge to be freed from any ordinance in the roome, place, and use of it. Lastly, in that Circumcision is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from our necks, it appears, that it belongs not to the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, which is invariable, and belongs to <hi>Gentiles</hi> as well as
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43338:59"/>
to <hi>Jewes,</hi> according to your conclusion. <q>
                  <hi>The next Scripture you bring, is</hi> Heb. 8.6. where our covenant is said to be established upon better promises.</q> If this Scripture serve to your purpose, then the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace now hath better promises then the covenant of Grace the <hi>Jews</hi> had: but this I know you will deny, who hold that <hi>the covenant of Grace is the same both to</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Gentiles. But that you may see how confusedly you thrust things together in this place, I pray you consider what covenant it is of which the Author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> speaks there, that it had not so good promises; Is it not expresly said to be that <hi>which God made, when he took the</hi> Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites <hi>by the hand, to bring them out of the land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>which covenant they brake,</hi> vers. 9. Now, although D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Crisp,</hi> vol. 2. Serm. 2. calls <hi>the covenant of</hi> Aarons <hi>Priestood a covenant of Grace, though of lesse grace</hi>; yet you say thus, <hi>pag.</hi> 10. <hi>and four hundred and thirty yeers after the Law was added, with great terror upon</hi> Mount Sinai, <hi>not as a part of this covenant</hi>; and after, <hi>plainly in that giving of the Law there was something of the covenant of works made with</hi> Adam <hi>in</hi> Paradise, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that you do grant there was a rehearsall of the covenant of works; though you do make it also to have something of the administration of the covenant of Grace. The truth is, the Scripture plainly makes it the covenant of works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10.12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.18. though I deny not that which you say, <hi>that it was intended as a preparative and means to fit them for Christ,</hi> and therefore may not unfitly be called <hi>foedus subserviens, a subservient covenant,</hi> as <hi>Cameron</hi> in his <hi>Theses de triplici foed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re.</hi> But this being so, to what purpose do you tell us, that <hi>our covenant is established upon better promises</hi>; as if the <hi>Jewes</hi> covenant were no better then that on <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> or as if the comparison concerning priviledges were between the covenant of Grace now, and the covenant of Works then; whereas the question is, as you say, <hi>page</hi> 31. <hi>which are branches of the covenant of Grace,</hi> and a little after, <hi>but were no part of the covenant of Grace, which God made to</hi> Abraham <hi>and his seed.</hi> Now <hi>the covenant of Grace is that made with</hi> Abraham, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.15, &amp;c. as your self alledge, <hi>pag.</hi> 10. and you say there, <hi>that covenant was for substance alwayes the same,</hi> and the substance as you recite it, <hi>is the promises and the condition</hi>; so that out of your own words it is clear, that we have no better promises in the covenant of Grace now, then they had then, only the administration of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace is now better then it was to them; then it was mixt with other particular promises, which because they are not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to al be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43338:59"/>
in the covenant of grace, therfore belong not to the covenant of Grace in Christ purely taken, such as the promise of deliverance from <hi>Egypt,</hi> setling in <hi>Canaan,</hi> &amp;c. For though it is true, that <hi>godlinesse hath the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come,</hi> yet the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the life that now is, is not a particular promise of possession of such or such a land to us or our seed, or the coming of Christ out of our posteritie, as it was then, but only a generall promise of Gods providing for his children with persecution, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.30. Then it was with expectation of Christ to come, now with assurance of Christ already come in the flesh, and accomplishing what was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told of him; then Christ was shadowed in darke types, now wee see him unveiled in a plaine history. So that though it be true that the priviledges of believers are now many wayes inlarged in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, yet simply the Covenant of Grace is not inlarged in respect of the substance of it, the promises of Grace and the condition, they are still belonging to the Elect and believers, and to no other. <q>The next Scripture you thus express. <hi>The glory of theirs had no glory in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of ours</hi>; for this you quote 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10.</q> But this passage is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meant of the Covenant at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> which is called <hi>the letter, ver.</hi> 6. <hi>The ministration of death written and ingraven in stones so glorious, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance, which glory was to be done away,</hi> ver. 7. <hi>The mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of condemnation,</hi> ver. 9. Which I suppose you doe not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand of the Covenant of Grace, and therefore it is impertinently al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. <hi>Your next is,</hi> 
               <q>they were under the bondage of Infants under age in comparison of our freedome.</q> For this you alledge, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1. &amp;c. But this is said of the administration in types and shadows and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, called <hi>the rudiments of the world,</hi> ver. 3. <hi>Concerning which it is confessed our priviledges are enlarged: but</hi> they are not branches of the Covenant of Grace, which every man who is in Covenant with God may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from God by vertue of the Covenant. <hi>You goe on,</hi> 
               <q>We as well as they are called a holy Nation, a peculiar people, a chosen Generation, separated to him from all other people:</q> It is granted we believers are such a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Nation, &amp;c. doth it therefore follow, that <hi>the priviledges of beleevers under this last and best administration of the Covenant of Grace are many wayes enlarged? You allude to that place,</hi>

               <q>
                  <hi>To which he saith.</hi> The contrary to this in the Text is cleare. First, by looking back to the words that there precede: It is meant of all those who do not professedly with the unbelieving Jewes reject Christ.</q> I have look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed backe and finde no such thing there. It is true, there is mention of some who did reject Christ, <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8. But that when <hi>Peter</hi> sayes, <hi>yee are a chosen Generation, a royall Priesthood, &amp;c.</hi> it should be meant of any other then true believers, who alone can offer spirituall sacrifice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God through Jesus Christ, is an interpretation which I disclaime, much more that it should be meant <hi>of all those who do not professedly with the unbelieving Jewes reject Jesus Christ. For then it may be said, not onely of</hi> Simon Magus, <hi>and other hypocrites, but also of all the salvages in the world that never heard of Christ, that</hi> they are a chosen Generation, a royall Pries<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> Blake <hi>addes,</hi> 
               <q>Which will yet more fully appeare by comparing the words of S<hi>
                     <hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul,</hi> Rom. 9.32, 33.</q> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

To me the Text he cites <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.32, 33. compared with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. doe as well agree to prove that 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. is meant <hi>of all those who doe not professedly with the unbelieving Jewes reject Christ,</hi> as a harp and a harrow doe consort to make musique. <hi>But perhaps wee may see more by looking forward.</hi>
               <q> Secondly, <hi>saith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                  </hi> Blake, by looking for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to that which followes in the character which the Apostle (before he ends his description) addes: which in times past were not a people, but now are the people of God. A speech taken from the Prophet to set forth the case of the Gentiles, as it is also by S<hi>
                     <hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul</hi> interpreted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.26. but the Gentiles thus called, and of no people made a people, have all a Covenant-holiness, and not alwayes inherent holiness.</q> Sure the word <hi>nation</hi> and <hi>people,</hi> did so run in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Blakes</hi> mind, that he could thinke of nothing but a nationall Church like the <hi>Jewes</hi>; whereas if he had weighed the words, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. of <hi>having obtained mercy,</hi> and considered that both <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.25. &amp; 26. are meant of the same, of whom he said <hi>ver.</hi> 23. that <hi>they were the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to glory,</hi> he would have plainly perceived the people and nation to be meant of the invisible Church of the Elect, and so nothing in that Text for <hi>the holiness of a believing Nation, as some speake, communicating a priviledge of the seales to the infants of that Nation</hi>: which how absurd a conceit it is, may be shewed perhaps more fully in that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:43338:60"/>
You <hi>adde to whom as well as to them belongs the adoption, the Covenant, the promises.</hi> You allude doubtless to <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. but had you alledged the whole Text, <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4, 5. you would then have seen that it speakes of peculiar priviledges of the <hi>Jewes, to whom the adoption, Covenants,</hi> that is, as <hi>Beza</hi> thinkes, <hi>the tables of the Covenant, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of their multiplying, having the Messiah from them, &amp;c.</hi> were pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar in the sense the Apostle there speakes: And so M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Rutherfurd</hi> due right of <hi>Presbyteries, Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>sect.</hi> 5. <hi>pag.</hi> 192. <hi>That they had prerogatives above us is cleare,</hi> Rom. 3.1, 2, 3. Rom. 9.4. <hi>and that in other respects far more excellent we have prerogatives above them it is as cleare,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.7, 8, 9. Mat. 13.16, 17. So that even in respect of the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> it is plaine the <hi>Jewes</hi> had some priviledges above us, and therefore this place proves the contrary to your conclusion, and that the want of some priviledges they had, may be recompensed by some other priviledges we have: And therefore you may see how fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a reason this is from the Jewish priviledge of infant-males circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision to prove infant-Baptisme. But to follow you in your way. <hi>You say,</hi>
               <q> we as well as they injoy him to be our Father, and with his dearest Sonne our Lord are made co-heires of the Kingdome of Glory.</q> All this is granted, but to what purpose it is produced I see not. <hi>You adde,</hi> 
               <q>we have all these things with advantage, not onely in the clearnesse of the administration, but in some sense in greater extent to persons with us; there is neither male nor female.</q> This is true also, we have the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Covenant of Grace, that is, justification, &amp;c. with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage not only in the clearness of administration, but in some sense in greater extent to persons with us. For now not only the small Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> but also of all Nations, believers are brought into the Covenant of Grace. But this proves not your conclusion, or any of those things that may serve for your purpose. You adde. <q>
                  <hi>And there is neither male nor female.</hi>
               </q> Why you adde this I know not, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you mean to insinuate, that in the Jewish Church there was male and female, because Circumcision was onely of Males. But neither doth the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.28. intimate, that wee are better than the <hi>Jewes,</hi> as if their females were not within the Covenant of Grace, nor will you say it. Now that which you were speaking of, was the substance of the Covenant of Grace, that <hi>wee are made co-heires of the Kingdome of Glory,</hi> &amp;c. not of the administration of it, and so there was no more distinction of male and female with the <hi>Jewes</hi> then with us, nor more priviledges of ours then of the <hi>Jewes</hi> in this particular.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43338:61"/>
Thus have I examined all the proofes you bring for your fifth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, and thereby you may perceive how you have heaped toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther many places of Scripture, without any usefull order or distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or pertinency to the thing in hand. <hi>You bring in next an objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thus;</hi>
               <q> Some indeed goe about to shew, that in some things the Jewes had greater priviledges then we have, as that Abraham had the priviledge to be called the Father of the Faithfull, that Christ should be borne of his flesh; Mary had the priviledge to be the Mother of Christ, and the whole Nation this priviledge, that God will call in their seed againe, after they had been cast off for unbeliefe many hundred yeares; which priviledges, say they, none of the Gentiles have or can have.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, that in answer to the argument from Circumcision, as it is popularly framed (which yet I perceive many that either are or should be scholars to examine things more scholastically, do or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to satisfie their consciences with) thus; <hi>If the children of believers be not to be baptized, then we have less priviledge then the Jewes; then the Grace of God under the new Testament, is straitned more then in the old.</hi> To this argument as being an argument of no weight, but onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vulgar and non-syllogizing capacities, among other things I said thus in my Latin paper above mentioned, <hi>Nec absurdum est dicere respectu aliquorum privilegiorum gratiam Dei contractiorem in novo Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento, quàm in veteri,</hi> v. gr. <hi>Nulla familia habet privilegium quod Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hami familiae concessum est, ut ex ea nasceretur Christus, nullus vir praeter Abrahamum pater fidelium, nulla faemina praeter unicam mater Christi,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yet it is not absurd to say, that in respect of some priviledges the grace of God is more contracted in the new Testament, then in the old: For instance; no family hath now the priviledge that was granted to Abrahams family, that out of it Christ should be borne: no man besides Abraham is called the Father of the faithfull; no woman besides one, the mother of Christ.</hi> By which I would shew, that it is no absurditie to grant that the <hi>Jewes</hi> may have more priviledges <hi>secundum quid, in some things,</hi> then wee, and yet our case and condition, to speak simply, better then theirs, by reason of other priviledges we have above them, which recompence the defect of those priviledges, whether real or supposed, which is the very same which as <hi>Robinson</hi> did alledge, so <hi>Rutherford</hi> grants in the place above-named, and cites two Scriptures to prove it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. And the truth is, priviledges are so arbitrary and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, that God gives them as he thinkes good, oft times without as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing any special reason, so that no argument can be drawne thus.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:43338:61"/>
God gave such a priviledge to the <hi>Jewes, Ergo,</hi> we must have such a priviledge too, except we can prove it is Gods will it should be so. And therefore this Argument is of no force, but rather an argument of arrogant presumption, without an institution to attempt to prove, that because the <hi>Jewes</hi> had a priviledge to circumcise infants, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must have a priviledge to baptize infants, nor doe any of the many Scriptures you have alledged, prove that Baptisme of infants is a priviledge granted by God in lieu of Circumcision: But you take upon you to answer this objection. You say, <q>but these things have no weight: we are inquiring for priviledges which are branches of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, which every man who is in Covenant with God, may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from God by vertue of the Covenant, were he a Jew or a proselyte, not for any particular or peculiar favour to a particular man or woman, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, or tribe: All these forementioned things, and many other of the like kind (as the ministery of the Tabernacle &amp; Temple to belong to one Tribe, the Kingly office to one family, such and such men never to lacke a man of their house to stand and before God) proceeded indeed from free grace, but were no parts of the Covenant of Grace, which God made to Abraham and all his seed. For could every man in Covenant challenge these things at Gods hand, and that by vertue of the Covenant? Could every one of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise that Christ should be borne of his flesh? or every one of their women that shee should be the mother of Christ? Could every one whom God ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be in Covenant with him, promise by vertue of the Covenant, that their Children, if cast off by unbeliefe, should after many hundred yeares be againe called in? We speak onely of such priviledges as were universall and common to all who were in Covenant, for which by vertue of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant they might relie upon God.</q> Though you say, <hi>the things objected have no weight,</hi> yet it may seeme they are so heavy &amp; presse your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion so hard, as that you cannot well ease it of them. The things objected, you deny not: but you answer, that they are impertinent: you tell us why, <hi>because you enquire for priviledges which are branches of the Covenant of Grace, common to all in Covenant, which they may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge at Gods hand by vertue of the Covenant,</hi> and such are not these. It is not materiall what you inquire after, men may <hi>sectari Aquilam in nubibus, follow after an Eagle in the Clouds.</hi> But sure I am the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures you bring, prove not <hi>that believers now have more priviledges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Covenant of grace, which all may challenge at Gods hands, then the Jewes had.</hi> Yea your second conclusion contradicts your fifth, understood in this sense. Beside, Circumcision was not a priviledge
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43338:62"/>
common to all in the Covenant of Grace: For besides all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full before <hi>Abraham,</hi> and those of his time, <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> and their households, and <hi>Job</hi> after his time, there was a sort of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes, called <hi>strangers, or of the gate,</hi> who were not circumcised, yet the Scripture reckons them among the worshippers of God. Such is <hi>Cornelius</hi> conceived to be by <hi>Mede</hi> in his discourse on <hi>Acts</hi> 17.4. by <hi>Selden lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de jure nat. &amp; Gent. c.</hi> 4. who is said to be <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, a <hi>godly</hi> or <hi>devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much almes to the people, and prayed to God alwayes,</hi> Act. 10.2. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore within the Covenant of Grace. Besides the priviledges alledged in the objection doe some of them at least belong to the Covenant of Grace as well as Circumcision, <hi>as to be Father of the faithfull, to be the Mother of Christ,</hi> and the last belongs much more to the Covenant of Grace then circumcision. And those <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. are priviledges which you alledge as belonging to the Covenant of Grace, to which I may joyne that <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2. that <hi>to them were committed the Oracles of God,</hi> which yet were prerogatives of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Rutherford</hi> rightly and according to truth. Lastly, the phrases, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.21. <hi>of the naturall branches,</hi> ver. 24. <hi>of the wild Olive by nature, thou wast graffed in besides nature, these according to nature,</hi> doe seeme to me to import, not that the <hi>Jewes</hi> were in the Covenant of Grace by nature, but that they had this priviledge to be reckoned in the outward administration, as branches of the olive by their birth, by vertue of Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the Gentiles have not. But you goe on. <q>Let any m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Let any man shew when and where this was taken away, when the infant children of believers were expunged out of the Covenant of grace.</q> It is unreasonable to require men to shew what they doe not avouch; it were equall to exact this taske at the hands of those who doe expunge the infant children of believers out of the Covenant of Grace: we neither write in nor expunge out; but leave that to God onely, from whom we learne, <hi>Esau have I hated, Jacob have I loved.</hi> Though you thinke your selfe sure, that <hi>all the infants of Covenanters were within the Covenant of Grace,</hi> yet I see no cause to believe you,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43338:62"/>
for as much as I thinke God never shewed you the booke of life, that you may see who are written in, who expunged out of the Covenant of Grace, and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> who was as well read in that booke as you, saith <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.8. <hi>They which are the children of the flesh, are not the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, but the children of the promise are counted for the seed,</hi> which how to spell I have shewed above. But you adde. <q>Certainly who ever will goe about to deprive them of it, to cut off such a great part of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of believing parents, must produce cleare testimonies before they can perswade believers to part with either of them, either right to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or to the seale of the Covenant.</q> And you adde two reasons of it. You are now on your advantage ground, in a veine of Oratory, and on a subject, of all others, aptest to move affections, to wit, parents tendernesse to their children. But wee must not sacrifice truth to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these. You insinuate that Antipaedobaptists goe about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive infant-children of believers of the Covenant of Grace. They may tell you, it were a madness for them to goe about such an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilitie, as the putting out or putting into the Covenant of grace, and that they hope so well of you, that you come not so neere the Papists, or <hi>Augustines</hi> opinion, as to thinke infants dying unbaptized, are out of the Covenant of Grace. And as for cutting off a great part of the comfort of believing parents, I pray you tell us what comfort is cut off by it, you cannot say that either an infant is certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated or saved by Baptisme, nor can you say, he is lost for want of it. What comfort then doe you give them indeed which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipaedobap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All the comfort you can indeed give them, is that according to your <hi>Hypotheses,</hi> they do their duty: But if it be proved that they prophane the Ordinance of Baptisme by bringing Infants to baptisme (which there is great cause to think they do) it may rather bring discomfort to their conscience in fine, then comfort. But to Believers indeed, Gods glory will be more deare then their own comfort; and therefore they will be content to part with that which dishonoured God, though it seemed cause of comfort to themselves: they will imitate <hi>Abraham,</hi> who quieted himself in the will of God concerning <hi>Ishmael,</hi> though deare unto him; and <hi>Isaac,</hi> who perceiving Gods rejecting of <hi>Esau,</hi> yet submitted to his will. And for your two reasons, because they are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a piece of pathetick oratory, I passe them over. For though there be some strains that Logically examined will not endure the test, yet

having learned the rule about reading the Fathers, not to account all their Rhetoricall expressions their Dogmaticall resolutions, I am willing to conceive the same of you. And as for your recapitulation of your conclusions, and your inference thereupon, how short they are of your conceit of them, I leave it to your self to consider, and proceed to that which you say is the main and only Objection re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining which hath any colour of weight in it.</p>

For, though it were proved that <hi>the children of Believers were in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, Baptisme succeeds to Circumcision, our priviledges greater then the</hi> Jewes, yet all this cannot acquit the practice of baptizing Infants from will-worship, without an institution, by Precept or Apostolicall example.

If then you do not stand to it here you may yeeld up your weapons.

Infants are not to be baptized, because that which is not in so many words com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the new Testament, ought not to be done? The conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence rightly framed is this: In meer positive worship that ought not to be done, which hath not Precept, or Apostolicall example equivalent to a Precept, gathered by plain words, or good inference out of the new Testament: For, if it have none of these, it is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worship. And Baptisme of Infants is such, therefore it ought not to be done. The ground of it is this, because all the ceremoniall or meere positive worship of the <hi>Jewes</hi> is now abrogated; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Precept of God to them is not a warrant to us now, if it were, it must be in one thing as well as another, and so we must bring on our necks the yoak of bondage of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Law. <hi>Now let us see how you encounter this Argument: you answer by telling us;</hi>

where ever that was done: will any man therefore say, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian women are not to be partakers of the Lords Supper? I think none will be so absurd as to affirm it. If it be said, though these things be not expresly and in <hi>terminis</hi> in the new Testament, yet they are there vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, and by undeniable consequence, I confesse it is true.</q> You do in this perioch, give two instances of practice, warranted by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or example, gathered by consequence in the new Testament, in the positive worship of the Sacraments, to wit, <hi>womens receiving the Lords Supper, and the baptizing of children of Believers, when grown per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which you grant are virtually, and by undeniable consequence in the new Testament, though not expresly and in</hi> terminis, <hi>in terms.</hi> Now this thing you need not have proved, I readily grant it, that what ever in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive worship is commanded in the new Testament, though it be not in formall terms commanded, yet if it may be gathered by virtuall consequence, ought to be done. Neverthelesse, I observe: First, that you do well expresse the institution of Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. when you say, <hi>expresse command there is, that they should teach the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and the Jews, and make them Disciples, and then baptize them,</hi> of which I may make further use afterwards. Secondly, that when you say, <hi>there is no expresse command, no example in all the new Testament, where women received the Sacrament of the Lords Supper,</hi> you imply there is for males.

And for your other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, as I do not remember any brings it but your self, so it is as little to the purpose as the other: For that which you say, <hi>that there is no expresse command that the children of Believers should be baptized when they are grown men.</hi> It is true, except they professe the faith; but there is an expresse command, as your self grant, to baptize Disciples, and so to baptize the childe of a Believer that professeth the faith, not otherwise; so that these your instances are brought to prove that which is not denied, and yet the instances are impertinent to prove it. You say further: <q>So have we virtually, and by undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able consequence, sufficient evidence for the baptizing of children, both commands and examples.</q> This assertion is full, if you mean by chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Infant-children of Believers, prove this, and you need prove no more.

You say, <q>For, first you have Gods command to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as he was the father of all covenanters, that he should seal his children with the seal of the covenant.</q> I grant we have Gods command to <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is indeed called, the Father of the faithfull, no where that I know, the father of all covenanters, to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcise his males of eight dayes old; and I deny not, but that this was a seal, <hi>that is,</hi> a confirming signe of the covenant God made with <hi>Abraham</hi>; whence <hi>Gods covenant was said to be in their flesh, Gen.</hi> 17.13. and 'tis called <hi>the covenant of circumcision, Act.</hi> 7.8. But you have need of the Philosophers stone to turn this into a command to baptize Infants of Believers, which you thus attempt.

Conceiving by your explication that you call the substance of the Covenant that which is invariable, and that which is accidentall that which is variable.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it is usuall to distinguish between the substance of the act, and the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of it, the essence and the accidents, but I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that Logicians do oppose the accidents of an act to the substance of it, and so your expression <hi>of the substance of the covenant, and that which is accidentall,</hi> is not in my apprehension, after the usuall speech of the Schooles, and therefore I cannot well tell what sense to make of it. If [<hi>them</hi>] referre to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> then it is said, <hi>something of the Sacraments was accidentall to the</hi> Jewes, but I know not how to make any handsome sense of this. If you referre [<hi>them</hi>] to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, you make something commanded by God, accidentall to the Sacraments, which may be yeelded you in this sense; that there might something have the essence of a Sacrament without such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, as it might be true Circumcision, though it were not the eighth day; it might be a true Passeover, though not on the right night. Yet, in this sense it cannot be yeelded that it was so acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, that it might be omitted without sin, any more then the thing it self: For, it was as well a sin, not to circumcise the eighth day, or not to keep the Passeover on the night appointed by God, as not to do these acts at all, since a command was broken in one as well as the other: For these reasons, I cannot well tell how to deny or grant that which you suppose, <hi>that some commands of God about the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the</hi> Jews, <hi>were accidentall to them. But that which is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,</hi>
               <q> that some of the commands of God about the Sacraments of the <hi>Jews,</hi> did contain things belonging to the substance of the Covenant, <hi>meaning, of the covenant of Grace, I can in no wise assent unto it:</hi>
               </q> For, if either you mean by substance the essence of the covenant, I utterly deny that any of the Sacraments of the <hi>Jews</hi> were of the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the covenant, Gods Covenant was, and might be without them: If you mean by substance, that which in no case might be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, I deny it in that sense also; Nothing of the sacraments of the <hi>Jews</hi> was morall and invariable. And it is most true, that as the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, so Sacraments (according to the common distinction) were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the administration of the covenant for the time, but never

Fifthly, those commands which were unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and weak rudiments of the world, contrary to Christ, begger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rudiments, these bind not a Christian now; but such are the <hi>Jews</hi> sacraments, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.18. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8.20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.3.9. therefore they bind not. Sixthly, those commands that belonged to another Priesthood
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:43338:66"/>
then Christs, bind not Christians, but the <hi>Jews</hi> sacraments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to another Priesthood then Christs, therefore they bind not. The <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Minor</hi> are both delivered, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.12.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. Seventhly, those commands that belonged to another covenant then that which now in force, bind not; but such are the commands of the <hi>Jews</hi> sacraments, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.1. therefore they bind not. Eightly, those commands which were proper to the <hi>Jews,</hi> bind not us Christians; but the sacraments of the <hi>Jews</hi> were proper to the <hi>Jews,</hi> so was Circumcision, the Passeover, the Sacrifices; therefore they bind us not. Ninthly, If one part bind us, then all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands bind us; and if we be obliged to any one rite, then to all, for they had all the same authority; nor hath that authority dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved any one part more then another. Now it is a sure rule, that <hi>ubi lex non distinguit, non est distinguendum, where the law distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth not, we must not distinguish</hi>; therefore, either none binds us, or else we must revoke <hi>Judaisme.</hi> And indeed, to say, so far a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God binds, and so far not, without a plain declaration of Gods will, is an high presumption, whereby man takes on him to release or dispense with Gods Law, which is of equall authority with the making of a law. Lastly, those commands bind us not, which the Apostle would not have us subject to, no not in part, but such are the commands of the Jewish sacraments, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16.20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. and your self say, <hi>pag.</hi> 27. <hi>the Apostle would take them off wholly from circumcision</hi>; therefore they bind us not: <hi>Yea, it is to overthrow ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly our Christian liberty by Christ, which the Apostle was so stiffe in maintaining that</hi> he would not yeeld, no, not one hou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <q> all the commands and institutions of God about the Sacraments of the <hi>Jews</hi> bind us as much as they did them in all things which belong to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Covenant, and were not accidentall to them.</q> But you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make good your Maxime by instances, and accordingly you say thus: <q>
                  <hi>As because Circumcision is called a seal of the covenant, therefore our Sacraments are seals of the covenant</hi>;</q> though circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion no where that I know, be called the seal of the covenant, but only <hi>the seal of the righteousnesse of faith,</hi> Rom. 4.11. yet, because it is called <hi>a signe or token of the Covenant,</hi> Gen. 17.11. it may well be called a seal or confirming signe of the covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and so of the covenant of Grace; and our Sacraments may be so called likewise, they being confirming signs of the new Testament, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.10.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:43338:67"/>
               <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. but not because Circumcision was called so, but because that phrase expresseth the truth of the thing. But what is this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to your purpose? Is there a command or institution of God, binding the <hi>Jews</hi> to call Circumcision so? or a command or insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution for us by vertue of the command to the <hi>Jews</hi> to call it so? though I should oppose him that should deny our Sacraments to be seals of the covenant, because he should deny a truth, yet I should not say he did sin that did not call them so. <hi>Your next instance is,</hi>

                  </gap>ause Circumcision might be administred but once, being the seal of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itiation, therefore Baptisme being also the seal of initiation is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred but once.</q> However I conceive no necessity of circumcision or Baptisme above once, yet I professe my self unsatisfied in this, that there is either a command, that a person be but once circumcised, or a person once only baptized: However, if there were a command that a person should be but once circumcised, and it could be proved that a person should be but once baptized, yet I utterly deny, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to circumcumcise but once, is a cammand to baptize but once; and therefore what ever any Divines may dictate Magisterially, yet I do not think my self in <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his School, that <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>he said it,</hi> should be my rule. <hi>You adde:</hi> 
               <q>but that circumcision was to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred on the eighth day only, was an accidentall thing, and therefore bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not.</q> I see no reason why once circumcising should belong to the substance of the covenant, and to be circumcised on the eighth day should be accidentall; yea, if reason may rule the roast, there is more reason that circumcising on the eighth day should belong to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the covenant, being commanded by God expresly, and as many of the Ancients conceive, particularly <hi>Cyprian, Ep.</hi> 99. <hi>ad finem,</hi> typifying Christs resurrrection on the eighth day, then that to be circumcised but once, should be of the substance of the covenant, which is neither commanded, nor is found in Scripture to ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifie any thing belonging to the Covenant: So vaine are mens conceits, without the light of the Word.</p>
            <p>But you go forward in the other Sacrament. <q>The Jewish Passeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver being to be yearly repeated, binds us to have a repetition of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, which came in roome of it, because this belongs to the substance of the Covenant; both of them being Sacraments for spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall nourishment, growth, and continuance in the Covenant: (as the other was, for birth and entrance) but that their Passeover was to be e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I grant the Lords Supper is to be repeated often, not because <hi>the Jewish Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over was to be yearly repeated, or because it is the Sacrament for spirituall nourishment, growth, and continuance in the Covenant (as the other was for birth and entrance)</hi> but because it may be plainly gathered from the Institution or Command of Christ, and the Apostles declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereupon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25, 26. for <gap reason="foreign">

               <q>you make the Evening accidentall to the Passeover, and so not binding us in the use of the Lords Supper, </q>
               <hi>it's but a dictate.</hi> The Evening of the Passeover is no more accidentall then the day it selfe, they being commanded both together. And for the Lords Supper, how we can be loose to receive it in the Morning or Evening after Supper, when the Apostle doth so distinctly mention in this relation of the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. that it was done in the night; and vers. 25. <gap reason="foreign">

extends not to the remission of the sinnes of our whole life, but of originall sinne onely.</p>
            <p>But you have yet one more Instance, and thus you speake; <q>The like Instance I give in our Christian Sabbath; the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment binds, as for the substance of it, as much as ever it bound the Jewes, there God once for all, separated one day of seven to be sacred to himselfe, and all the world stood bound in all ages to give unto God that one day of seven, which should be of his own choosing. Now untill Christs time, God chose the last day of the seven to be his Sabbath; and having by the death and Resurrection of our Lord Jesus, put an end to the Saturday Sabbath, and surrogated the first day of the week instead thereof to be the Lords day, wee need no new Commandement for the keeping of the Lords day, being tyed by the fourth Commandement to keep that day of seven which the Lord should choose; the Lord having chosen this, the fou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All these things God commanded to Abraham, and charges upon all the children of the Covenant, though there were no expresse reviving these Commands

in any part of the New Testament. And therefore consequently, that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God to Abraham, which bound his seed of the Jewes to traine up their children in that manner of worship, which was then in force, binds the seed of Abraham now, to traine up their children in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

by baptizing them</hi>;</q> which if true, then the Apostles needed to have done nothing else, in observance of that command of discipling, but to baptize, and it would serve for a good plea for non-preaching, or meer officiating Priests: whereas in <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.15. which I think will not be denied to be parallel to this, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Disciple all nations, is preach the Gospel to every creature.</hi> But this conceit is so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, that I presume none that hath any wit will entertain it, though the paper be licensed. That which I have hitherto discoursed, tends to this, to prove, that when Christ saith, <hi>Teach all nations, and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them,</hi> his meaning is, by <hi>preaching the Gospel to all nations, make them Disciples, and baptize those that become Disciples of all nations.</hi> Now, concerning the Position, which after M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Blake</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therfurd,</hi> you seem to imbrace, concerning the federall or externall holinesse of a believing or chosen nation, giving right to the Infants of that nation to be baptized. Give me leave to argue a little: First, if Infants may be baptized, because they are born in a chosen nation, or a believing nation, then there may be a rule whereby we may know when a nation may be called a believing, or chosen nation, when not; otherwise we should not know when to make use of this title to baptisme, when not: and it were absurd to conceive God should give us a rule, and no direction how to make use of it. But no rule can be assigned whereby to know when a nation is a believing, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, or discipled nation, giving right to baptize Infants of that nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when not; <hi>Ergo,</hi> If it be said they may be known, in that they are descended from such a Believer as <hi>Abraham.</hi> I reply, then God would have lef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> us a note to know such a nation by, as he did <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> posterity by Circumcision: But there is no such note, nor any such nation marked out; this were indeed contray to the appointment of admitting all nations. If it be said when the king of a countrey is a Believer, this is no rule; for it may be he may be a Believer, and all the rest unbelievers, and then the practice of baptizing Infidels afore they are instructed at the command of Princes: As when <hi>Charles</hi> the great fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ced the <hi>Saxons</hi> to be Christians, were to be justified. If it be said, the nation is a believing nation, when the representative bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy believes, and so the children of that people may be baptized: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, the representative body may be Believers, and the greatest part Infidels, Papists, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> these Infidels children must then be baptized; yea, the Infidels themselves, by vertue of an implicit faith in their governours faith; for they are a part of the nation. And therefore if
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:43338:73"/>
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Blakes</hi> Argument be good: <hi>The Infants of any nation make up a part of the nation, and the nation where they came was to be discipled; and therefore the Infants to be baptized</hi>: the same reason holds for Infidels of age, for they are a part of the nation. If it be said, it is a believing nation, when the greatest part are Believers, how shall that be known? How shall a minister do when he cannot come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it? must he stay till they be counted by poll, as the Sheriffes do at the election of Knights of the Shire, and upon Certificate that the major part is believing, then baptize? Why did not the Apostles so, nor any other Ministers to this day? How ill would it fare with some poor Christians, who are but a handfull in respect of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of unbelievers of their own nation, as in the Primitive times, when Princes and States were adversaries to Christianity? If it be said, when all <hi>adulti</hi> of ripe yeers are believers, then such a right is asserted as never was, nor perhaps ever will be, except <hi>when all Israel shall be saved</hi>; and so no Infants shall be baptized on this ground. Secondly, but, if it could be resolved what number or sort of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers make a believing nation, giving title to Infant-baptisme, yet there would be uncertainty concerning the kind of believing, which might denominate a believing or chosen nation, having federall or externall holinesse, such as may create title to the baptisme of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of that nation. There are some nations that are reckoned among Believers, which yet are mis-believers, as Heretiques, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, the nation of the <hi>Goths,</hi> who were <hi>Arians</hi>; or grosly Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, as the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> shall they give title to their children to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, when without repentance they cannot be deemed capable of communion in the body of Christ? Thirdly, if Infants of wicked parents be capable of baptisme, because born in a believing nation, then this priviledge agrees to them, either in respect of their descent, or the place of their birth, or both. If in respect of their descent, then either their descent within mans memory, or their descent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all the memory of man. If of their descent within memory and knowledge, then Foundlings have no title hereby to Baptisme, of whose parentage there is no knowledge, neerer or remoter, who are neverthelesse baptized: If of that beyond memory, it must be upon such a ground, as is common to all Infants in the world, which are descended from some Believer, in some precedent generation; or else such a rule must be set down, as hath no certainty in it, by which to administer that Ordinance: If from the place of birth only, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:43338:73"/>

                  <hi>that then the children of a believing parent should be all sanctified, whereas the contrary is manifest: as in</hi> Absolom, <hi>the son of</hi> David, proceeds upon this mistake, that by <hi>the root and first fruit,</hi> are meant any Ancestor; whereas it is meant of <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the faithfull, as <hi>Deodate</hi> in his <hi>Annot.</hi> on <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. or, at most, <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in whose names all the elect are comprehended, when God calls himself <hi>The God of</hi> Abraham, Isaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob, as our Saviour intimates, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.37, 38. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.32. <hi>Mar.</hi> 12.26, 27.</q>And for that which he saith, <q>

of God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> in which sense they were federally holy; yet this did neither give right for the baptizing of children of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Jewes</hi> in <hi>Pauls</hi> time, nor now. <q>And for that which he saith that God hath chosen the race and nation of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> it is not right:</q> For God hath not chosen simply the race and nation of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but a people to himself, out of the race and nation of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as it is said, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Thou hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and nation.</hi> As for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Blakes</hi> Argument, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it falls in with your reason, I shall answer them together in that which followes.

               <q>that Christ did bid them baptize all nations, after the manner that the <hi>Jews</hi> did circumcise one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>And M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Blake <hi>doth conceit this so strongly, that he saith,</hi> this cannot be denyed of an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, that will have the Apostles to be able to know Christs meaning by his words in this enlarged Commission.</q>
               <hi>Secondly</hi> , <q>that the nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> were discipled when they were circumcised.</q> I do not impute it to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Blake</hi> through defect of ability to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, but through the strong hold which these points have in his minde, <hi>that Baptisme succeeds Circumcision, in the place, roome, and use of it, and the covenant of the Gospel is all one, with the covenant made to</hi> Abraham, that he imagines there should be such an allusion to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, as that the Disciples must understand Christs meaning, whom to baptize from the Precept of circumcision, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. but in mine apprehension, there is no colour for such a conceit. 'Tis true, he enlargeth their commission, and bids them, <hi>Go and make Disciples of all nations</hi>; or, as it is in <hi>Mark, Preach the Gospel to every creature, and then to baptize the Disciples of all nations</hi>; but this enlargement of commission was not in opposition to the restriction about cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. but in opposition to the restriction, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.5, 6. as your self rightly expresse it, <hi>pag.</hi> 44.

                  <hi>that the nation of the</hi> Jews <hi>were discipled, that their Infants were discipled, that the nation was made Disciples in</hi> Abrahams <hi>loines</hi>; </q>it is

And sure, if the Apostles had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood our Saviours command thus: [<hi>Disciple all nations baptizing them</hi>; that is, <hi>Admit the infants of all nations to baptisme, as the</hi> Jews <hi>did the male Infants of that one nation to circumcision</hi>] they might have saved themselves a great deal of labour of preaching afore baptisme, and of baptizing females, and would have left us some precedent of such a practice.

if this Scripture be the rule of administring ordinarily that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which it indeed is, and hath been still taken to be.

But if you mean it thus, that the Disciples knew, that when any pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were made disciples, barely and precisely for this reason with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other, the children were actually disciples, and so to have Baptisme administred to them, it is an untruth, that hath no ground for it.

Christ.</q> It is hard to say, that parents are to teach Infants from their infancy the Knowledge of Christ: For, though it is said of <hi>Timothy, Thou hast known the Holy Scriptures,</hi>

But you tell us: <q>And at the present, they are capable of his own teaching.</q> I deny not but Infants are capable of Christs own teaching, yea, of actuall faith, yea, of actuall profession of faith.

               <q>Who then is not afraid to refuse them, who will receive Christ? Who will not baptize them, that is willing to baptize disciples in the name of Christ?</q> But this is a triumph afore victory. The plain truth is, there's never a one of all the three Texts, speaks of little ones in respect of age.

And thus, like another <hi>Sisyphus,</hi> the stone you roul returns upon you: <hi>Volvendo saxum sudas, nec proficis bilum, you sweat in rouling a stone, and yet profit not a whit</hi>; and you are so far from proving by virtuall and undeniable consequence, a command to baptize Infants of Believers, according to ordinary rule, that on the contrary, this Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.19. clearly proves Infants are not by ordinary rule to be baptized, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Disciples of all nations, and no other, are appointed to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; and therefore baptizing of Infants is besides the institution, and so wil-worship. But yet M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Blake</hi> hath one Text for a reserve, which he thus puts in array: <q>Let that Text of the Prophet be well weighed, where speaking by the Spirit of prophecy of the rejection of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the glorious call of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in their stead, in that ample way, as it is there set out, hath these words: Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and set up my Standard to the people, and they shall bring thy sons in their arms; and thy daughters shall be carried on their shoulders, <hi>Isai.</hi> 49.22. If there were but such an hint, as that by way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy to have left them behind, we should from some have heard of it with a noise.</q> It may be truly said, the alledging this Text for Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, is but a noise, <hi>vox &amp; praeterea nihil, a voyce, and nothing beside,</hi> as the <hi>Spartan</hi> said of the Nightingal. To it I answer, that the allusion is to nursing-fathers and mothers, carrying children on shoulders, and in their arms, and the speech is metaphoricall, as <hi>Junius</hi> saith in his <hi>annot.</hi> in locum, <hi>Haec omnia allegoricè dicuntur, all these things are spoken allegorically,</hi> and may be either understood, as he speaks, <hi>of the spirituall amplifying of Christs Kingdom</hi>; and so children were brought on arms and shoulders among <hi>Gentiles</hi> by preaching and instruction, as when the Apostle saith, <hi>he was gentle among the</hi> Thessalonians <hi>as a nurse that cherisheth her children,</hi> 1 Thes. 2.7. or, it may be understood of the return of the <hi>Jews</hi> from captivity; and that the following verses make more probable; nor is there a word in the Text that I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, of the rejection of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as he sayes, but of their restitution.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:43338:77"/>
But if it must be understood properly, which hath no likelihood, it may be as well conceived of bringing their children to have laying on of hands, as baptizing of them. I go on to that which followes in your Sermon.</p>

               <note place="margin">§. 14. <hi>Of examples in Scripture of Infants Baptisme, particularly of baptizing of housholds.</hi>
               </note>
               <q>ANother command by good consequence for the baptizing of infants, you shall finde in the forementioned place: when the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth them to repent and be baptized, &amp;c. because the promise was made to them and to their children, which as I shewed clearly proves that the children of such as beleeve and are baptized, are taken into Covenant, and therefore by good consequence they are to receive the seale of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the Text not onely shewing that they are within the Covenant, but also that a right to Baptisme is a consequence of being within the Covenant.</q> This text hath been examined before, and it hath been proved that the promise there is the sending of Christ, who was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up to blesse them and their children first, then those that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farre off, being called, and that the promise doth not belong to their children, as the children of beleevers, but as called, and that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is not alledged as of it selfe giving right for them or their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be baptized, without any other consideration, but as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and incouragement for them to repent, and so to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus; for the remission of sinnes, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had crucified the Lord of glory, and wished his bloud to be upon them, and their children; which being thus rightly understood, is so farre from proving a command to baptize infants, that on the contrary, it proves they are not to be baptized. You say further; <q>Thus for Commands: for examples, though there should be none, there is no great argument in it, when the rule is so plaine, yet we have examples enough by good consequence.</q> It is true, if the rule were plaine, there would be no need of an example; and on the other side, if wee had regulating examples, we should thereby know how to interpret the rule. But whereas you say, <hi>wee have examples enough by good conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi> it may be well suspected, these examples will prove like the commands, by consequence meere conjectures and conceits of men that would have it so. But let us heare what you say. <q>For you shall finde, that the Gospel tooke place just as the old administration, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in whole families together; when Abraham was taken in, his whole familie was taken in with him; when any of the Gentiles turned prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes, ordinarily their whole families came in with them; so in this new
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:43338:78"/>
administration, usually if the master of the house turned Christian, his whole familie came in and were baptized with him; the whole house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of Cornelius, the first converted Gentile, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.14. the houshold of Stephanus, the houshold of Aristobulus, the houshold of Narcissus, the houshold of Lydia, the houshold of the Gaoler: These are examples not to be contemned.</q> True: nor any part of holy Scripture which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for our learning, but in all these, there is no example of an infants baptizing in the Scripture. You say,<q> the Gospel tooke place just as the old administration, by bringing in whole families together.</q> By the old administration, you meane circumcision. But wee doe not finde the Gospel or Baptisme tooke place just in the manner or circumcision; for in circumcision, it was but in one familie singled out, of the males onely, whether in the covenant of grace or not, children or servants, elder or younger, at eight dayes old, in the house, by the Master of the familie, or others in his stead. But in Baptisme it is cleane other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, so that you might more truly have said, the new administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Baptisme is just opposite to that of circumcision, yea in respect of that one thing wherein you make them agree so well, the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of whole families together, it was but contingently so, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes so, nor constantly so, according to any promise or prophecy, and when it did so happen, we finde not any infant baptized, nor any intimation of baptizing housholds, in conformitie to the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of circumcision. And this may appeare by going through the examples of baptizing in the new Testament. Concerning <hi>John</hi> the Baptist, it is said, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea, and all the region round about Jordan, and were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sinnes.</hi> Luk. 3.29. <hi>And all the people that heard him, and the Publicans justified God, being baptized with the baptisme of John; but the Pharisees and Lawyers rejected the counsell of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.</hi> Concerning Christ and his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, it is said, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>When the Lord knew how the Pharisees heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples then Iohn (though Iesus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe baptized not but his disciples.)</hi> In these examples the practise of baptizing, is not by taking in a familie, but by admitting all that would become disciples over all the Countries. After the ascension of Christ, the first example of Baptisme, is that <hi>Acts</hi> 2.44. and there it is said, <hi>They that gladly received the Word were baptized</hi>; and these were they to whom he had said, <hi>ver.</hi> the 39. the <hi>promise is to you and to your children; and there were added unto them about three thousand soules,</hi> and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:43338:78"/>
yet never an infant baptized, unlesse we shall take M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Thomas Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wins</hi> conceit for an Oracle (possibly the more willingly taken up, that it might seeme the more credible, that the Church of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was but one single formed Congregation in a Church way) that therefore it is said, <hi>There were added three thousand soules</hi>; to intimate, that there were men, women and children added: he might have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served how ridiculous such a conceit is by that which follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 42. <hi>And they continued stedfastly in the Apostles doctrine, and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayer, and feare came upon every soule, &amp;c.</hi> Which if he can apply to infants, <hi>Erit mihi magnus Apollo,</hi> I shall take his words for Oracles. Now sure these three thousand soules were not one family. The next example is of the <hi>Samaritanes,</hi> of whom it is said, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.12. <hi>That when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the Kingdome of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized men and women.</hi> Where it is plaine, that in a manner the whole Citie were baptized; for <hi>ver.</hi> 6. it is said, <hi>The multitude with one accord ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The next are of the Eunuch, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.38. and <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 9.18. which were single be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving persons, not a whole familie. The next is of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> of whom you gather from <hi>Acts</hi> 11.14. "<hi>That his whole houshold were baptized.</hi> But it is true withall, that his house was not an ordinary familie, but a garrison of Souldiers. 2. <hi>That he called together his kinsmen and neare friends,</hi> Acts 10.24. 3. That <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>This whole house feared God.</hi> 4. That no other are nominated to have been baptized, but those <hi>who had heard the word,</hi> ver. 44. <hi>which spake with tongues, and magnified God,</hi> ver. 46. <hi>which received the holy Ghost,</hi> ver. 47. <hi>who were saved by Peters words,</hi> Acts 11.14. which I presume will not be affirmed of infants. "Then you mention <hi>the houshold of Stephanas, which is said to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.16. and also <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.15. is said <hi>to addict themselves to the ministery of the Saints.</hi> To this houshold most aptly may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned that which you omit, the house of <hi>Crispus,</hi> concerning whom 'tis said <hi>Acts</hi> 18.8. <hi>And Crispus the chiefe ruler of the Synagogue belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on the Lord, with all his house, and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.</hi> Where under the tearme <hi>houshold,</hi> those onely are meant who believed, and those that among the <hi>Corinthians</hi>

                  <hi>in the houshold of Aristobulus, the houshold of Narcissus,</hi>
               </q> and you doe allude to <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.10, 11. but these are onely brought in to make a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. For though our translators in the Text, reade <hi>of Aristobulus and Narcissus houshold,</hi> yet in the Greeke it is <gap reason="foreign">

               <q> is the houshold of Lydia, of whom it was said, that shee was baptized, and her houshold, Acts 16.15.</q> But this must be understood by other places, which when they expresse the baptizing of the houshold, they expresse also the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, or receiving of the Word by the whole houshold, and by the frequent use of the Word, which is to put the house for the people of growth in it; as, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.13. <hi>Mark.</hi> 3.25. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.4. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.17. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.53. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.2. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.19.

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:43338:79"/>
that the Gospel tooke place just as the old administration, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in whole families together. Yea the contrary appeares out of the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.13.16. that the husband was converted some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times without the wife, and on the contrary, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.21. &amp; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.22. in the house of infidel Masters were converted servants, and on the contrary, <hi>Philem.</hi> 11.12.14, 15, 16. And our Lord Christ foretold it should be so in the preaching of the Gospel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.35, 36. Wherefore I much marvaile at the speech of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Blake, pag.</hi> 22. <q>We have examples not to be contemned of the baptizing whole housholds, and whether infants were there or no, as it is not certaine, though proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, so it is not materiall, the president is an houshold; He that followeth the president, must baptize housholds; It appeares not that any wife was there, yet he that followes the president in baptizing of housholds, must baptize wives, and so I may say servants, if they be of the houshold.</q> Which speech, though it containes onely dictates, and might be let passe, yet it is not fit to leave it without some animadversions. For if it be true, that the president is an houshold, and wee must baptize house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds, I aske whether we must baptize wife and servants, because they professe the faith, or because they be of the houshold: if the first be said, then the president is not of baptizing housholds, but baptizing a professor of the faith, which is the thing the Antipaedobaptists con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for; if because of the houshold, whether professing faith or not, then an unbelieving wife or servant should be baptized, because they are of the houshold, unlesse it be supposed, that in an houshold when the Master or a husband is a believer, the wife and servant cannot be an unbeliever, the contrary whereof hath appeared above: But this I believe, none will deny to be absurd, and heterodox, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that speech of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Blakes</hi> is very absurd, that I say no worse of it. To which I adde, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Blake</hi> gives no reason, nor I thinke can, why the baptizing of housholds, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. should be the precedent for baptizing rather then the baptizing <hi>Samaria, Act.</hi> 8.12. the 3000. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. all <hi>Judea, Mat.</hi> 3.5. So that in fine, it appeares that <hi>the administration of Baptisme is not just as the administration of circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and that though it be true, that sometimes housholds were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, yet it is said, <hi>those housholds received the Word,</hi> and the word <hi>hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,</hi> is often put for the growne people of it, and therefore as yet there is no example in Scripture to justifie the baptizing of infants, according to ordinarie rule. As for the objection of the houshold, eating the Passeover, and the answer to it, I shall let it passe now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:43338:80"/>
it will come againe in the last objection of the fourth part of your Sermon. And thus I have at last examined your first and maine argument. Your second, it seemes, you make lesse account of, and therefore I shall sooner dispatch the answer. Thus you frame it.</p>

               <q>THe second argument: to whom the inward grace of Baptisme belongs, to them belongs the outward signe, they ought to have the signe, who have the thing signified, the earthly part of the Sacrament must be granted to those who have the heavenly part: but the infants of believers, even while they are infants, are made partakers of the inward grace of Baptisme, of the heavenly and spirituall part, as well as growne men: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may and ought to receive the outward signe of Baptisme. The major proposition, that they who are made partakers of the inward grace, may not be debarred of the outward signe, is undeniable: it is Peters ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. Can any forbid water, that these should not be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, who have received the holy Ghost as well as wee? And againe, for as much as God gave them the like gift, as he did unto us, what was I that I could withstand God? <hi>And</hi> this is so cleare, that the most learned of the Anabaptists doe readily grant, that if they knew any infant to have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the inward grace, they durst not deny them the outward signe, and that the particular infants whom Christ took up in his armes and blessed, might have been baptized.</q> The Question between us is, whether the infants of believers universally, or indifferently, are to be admitted to the Sacrament of Baptisme, according to ordinary rule. Now I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you doe not hold that the infants of believers indifferently have actually the thing signified by Baptisme, that is, the Holy Ghost, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Christ, adoption, forgivenesse of sinnes, regeneration, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting life: for then they are all sanctified, and are all believers, and if this could be proved, there would be no question about Paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptisme, the texts, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.37. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.47. <hi>Act.</hi> 11.17. would undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly prove it, and therefore there is no Antipaedobaptist, I thinke, but will grant your <hi>Major; That regenerate persons united to Christ, whose sins are forgiven, adopted persons that have received the Holy Ghost, are to be baptized.</hi> But I conceive, though in the laying down the <hi>Major,</hi> you use these phrases [<hi>who have the thing signified, who have the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly part</hi>]: and in your <hi>Minor [are made partakers</hi>]; yet you do not mean in this Assumption, actuall having, and being made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the inward grace of Baptism; concerning which, the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paedobaptists do so readily grant the <hi>Major:</hi> but a potentiall having,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:43338:80"/>
or, as you after speak, <hi>being capable of the inward grace</hi>; and so you use the fallacy of equivocation: in the <hi>Major, [having</hi>] being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of actuall having, and in the <hi>Minor</hi> of potentiall, which makes four terms, and so the Syllogisme is naught: Or, if you do mean in both actuall having, you mean it only of some Infants of Believers, not of all, of whom the Question is, and so your conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is but particular, that some Infants of Believers, who are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied actually, are to be baptized. But this will not reach home to your tenet or practice, concerning the baptizing of all Infants of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, in as much as they are the children of Believers, without the consideration of actuall faith or sanctification.

holds positions somewhat like to the <hi>Lutherans, that though children of believing parents be not all holy and righteous, they may degenerate, apostatize, yet the Infants of believing parents are righteous by imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are believers and confessors imputatively,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>pag.</hi> 10. and elsewhere.

If you understand them of actuall having, and they be universall, then I deny your <hi>Minor.</hi> If your <hi>Major</hi> be understood of potentiall having, I deny it, if of actuall, and the <hi>Minor</hi> be of potentiall, there be four terms, and so the Syllogisme is naught. Take away the ambiguity of your terms, and the answer is easie. But for the proof of your <hi>Minor,</hi> you say thus: <q>And for the Assumption, or Minor, That the Infants of Believers, even while they are Infants, do receive the inward grace as well as grown men, is as plain, not only by that speech of the Apostle, who saith, they are holy, but our Saviour saith expresly, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. That to such belongs the Kingdome of God, as well as to grown men; And whereas some would evade it, by saying, that the Text saith not, To them belongs the kingdome of God, but of such is the Kingdome of heaven, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, of such like, that is, such as are graced with such like qualities, who are humble and meek, as children are: and that <hi>Luke</hi> 18. is parallel to this in the meaning of it: whosoever doth not receive the Kingdome of heaven as a little child, be shall not enter therein. But I answer, though it be true, that in other places this is one use that Christ makes of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants age and condition, to shew, that such as receive the Kingdome of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:43338:81"/>
heaven, must be qualified with humility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> like unto children; yet here it cannot be his meaning, because his argument is, Suffer them to come to me, and forbid them not, because of such is the Kingdome of God, <hi>that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> my Church and Kingdome is made of those, as well as of others. This was the very cause, why the disciples rebuked those who brought the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Christ, because they were little, not fit to be instructed; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not fit that Christ should be troubled about them; this Christ rebukes in them, and tels them, that the littlenesse of children, is no argument why they should be kept from him: Suffer them, said he, to come, and forbid them not, for of such is the Kingdome of God; and what kinde of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument had this been, if the Text should be interpreted as these men would have it; Suffer little children to come unto me, that I may touch them, take them up in mine arms, put my hands upon them, and blesse them, because the Kingdome of God belongeth to them, who have such like qualities, who resemble children in some select properties? By the very same ground, if any had brought doves and sheep to Christ to put his hands upon them, and blesse them, the Disciples had been liable to the same reproof, because of such is the Kingdome of God, such as are partakers of the Kingdome of God, must be endued with such like properties.</q>

            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> to be proved is, that all the Infants of Believers, or the Infants of Believers in as much as they are Infants of Believers, are actually partakers of the inward grace of Baptisme, else your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will not serve for your purpose, as hath been shewed. Now nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the Apostles speech, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. prove it, as hath been shewed above; nor doth this Text, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.14. prove it. For, first, it is doubtfull, whether these were Infants or no. I presume you are not ignorant, that <hi>Piscator observat:</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.14. doth maintain that the speech of Christ, is not of Infants, but of children which were capable of instruction, which he gathers from this, that Christ cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.16.

                  </gap> doth signifie one that is <hi>madidus, moist or sappie,</hi> it is of no force to prove that they were Infants:</q> For besides, that not etymologie, but use must expound words; if it were so, yet we know children are moist, till they be <hi>adolescentes,</hi> youths; we say, till they be of good yeers, they are but a gristle, tender, green; so that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this, the children brought to Christ, might be of yeers sufficient to be <hi>catechumeni,</hi> and yet fit enough to resemble humility and harmlesnesse by. Secondly, It is yet doubtfull whether our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour said, <hi>of them is the Kingdome of heaven</hi>; for the word is <gap reason="foreign">

But you have two exceptions against this: First, <q>because this had been no reason why they should suffer these little children to come to him, because, of such is the Kingdome of God: <hi>Secondly,</hi> he might as well have said, suffer sheep, or doves to come to me; for of such is the Kingdome of God.</q> To these exceptions it may be replied, the reason may be thus conceived; therefore you should not despise that age as prophane, and keep them from me, for even they that are my Disciples, must become children again, in putting off their vices, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing converted, unlearning what they have learned, becoming humble and docible, which things could not be resembled by sheep and doves.

               <hi>these and the like,</hi> yet there is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, only conjecture, that they were believers Infants. For, though Christ was in the coasts of <hi>Judea</hi> then, yet it might as well be, that the children were brought by others as parents, and that without faith in Christ, as the Messiah, upon the fame of his miracles, and the conceit he was a prophet, and so they might bring children to him to be blessed, as <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> by <hi>Isaac, Josephs</hi> children by <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> &amp;c. Fourthly, but let it be granted they were the Infants of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:43338:82"/>
and that it is said, <hi>of these is the Kingdome of God,</hi> it may be, as <hi>Piscator</hi> observes, referred not to thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> present estate, as if for the present they were in the kingdome of God, that is, believers and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified; but that they were elect persons, and so in time of them should be the Kingdom of God: Now that which gives right to Baptisme, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the present estate of a person. Fifthly, but let that be also granted, yet all this proves not your <hi>Minor,</hi> unlesse you can prove, that the reason why the Kingdome of heaven belongs to Infants, is common with these to other Infants of Believer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and the reason why their<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is the Kingdome of God, is, because they were the Infants of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o it may be true of all the Infants of Believers. But this cannot be true, being contrary to expresse Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6, 7, 8.13. and inferring this error, that a childe hath right to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, in that he is the childe of a Believer: And experience proves innumerable of them have no interest in the Kingdome of God. Besides, this reason may be given, why these Infants did belong to Gods Kingdome, because they were such as Christ would blesse, and then all that you can gather from hence will be, that of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Believers whom Christ blesseth, is the Kingdome of heaven. But this will never prove your Assumption, except you can prove that Christ blesseth all the Infants of Believers. Lastly, Christs action in this businesse is proper to him, as the great Prophet of the Church, and extraordinary, and therefore yeelds no ground for an ordinary rule of baptizing by the publique Ministery. And, if an ordinary rule should be made in imitation, of it, it would serve better for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sacrament of confirmation, which <hi>Art.</hi> 25. of the Church of <hi>England</hi> puts among things, <hi>grown from a corrupt following the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> then Baptisme. And in all probability, if Christ would have this accident <q>
                  <hi>to be a rule or precedent for bringing Infants to him by a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible signe in the new Testament,</hi>
               </q> as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Thom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For which reason, it seems to me, that this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample rather shews Christ would not have Infants baptized, then that he intended to make this accident a precedent for paedobaptisme. But you will prove your <hi>Minor</hi> by reasons, and thus you reason:</p>
            <p>
               <q>Beside, what one thing can be named, belonging to the initiation and being of a Christian, whereof Baptisme is a seal, which Infants are not capable of as well as grown men; they are capable of receiving the Holy Ghost, of union with Christ, of adoption, of forgivenesse of sins, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:43338:83"/>
of everlasting life; all which things are signified, and se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>led in the Sacrament of Baptisme.</q> I may apply to you the words of <hi>Horace, Amphora coepit institui, currente rota cur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>recus exit? A barrell began to be made, why the wheel running doth a pitcher come forth?</hi> The thing you should prove is, that all the Infants of Believers, are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally partakers of the inward grace of Baptisme; but in stead of this, you prove, they are capable of it; they may have it, but doth it therefore follow, that they actually have it? It was once an Axiome in the Schools; <hi>a posse ad esse non valet argumentum, from it may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then may all children be baptized, for they are all capable of the inward Grace of Baptisme. But you have yet something more to say.</p>
            <p>
               <q>And it is further considerable that in the working of that inward grace, of which Baptisme is the signe and seal, all who partake of that grace, are but meer patients, and contribute no more to it then a child<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o create in them a heart of flesh, to forgive their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, to love them freely; what doth the most grown men in any of these more then an Infant may do, being only passive in them all? and of this first grace is the Sacrament of Baptisme properly a seal.</q> That which you say, it is true, is further considerable; but to what purpose it is here brought in, I cannot readily divine, whether it be for a proof of the <hi>Minor</hi> of your Syllogisme; or that which you said immediatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>that Infants are capable of the inward grace of Baptisme</hi>; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you would make a further Argument for Infant-baptisme thus: Baptisme is to be given to those that are capable of the first grace as well as grown men; and the proof of this seems to be, because Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme seals properly the first grace. But Infants are capable of the first grace as well as grown men, and the proof of this seems to be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all who partake of that grace, are but meer patients, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Infants are to be baptized as well as grown men. If this be your Argument, the <hi>Major</hi> is to be denyed: For, a person is not to be
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:43338:83"/>
baptized because he may have grace, but because he hath it. And for the reason, <hi>that Baptisme seals properly the first grace,</hi> it is obscure, what you mean by the first grace is not cleare. If the free favour of God, mentioned before, when you say, [<hi>to love them freely</hi>] this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the first grace simply Gods eternall love and election; and I deny not but Baptisme seals it in some sense properly, and so doth the Lords Supper as properly; if you mean by the first grace the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, which is the first transient act of grace, that also is sealed properly in Baptisme, and as properly in the Lords Supper: if you mean the first grace in execution, it is uncertain w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> you put first, justification or regeneration, or, as some, adoption: And then which is the second grace is uncertain, whether after-sanctification, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operating, concomitant, subsequent grace, sustentation against tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, remission of sins, hearing prayers, or eternall glory. Now, I do not well understand in what sense, or why Baptisme seals pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly rather the first grace then the second, sith according to your doctrine it is a seal of the covenant of grace; and therefore of all the promises in it; Nor can I tell, why it should be said, that Baptisme seals the first grace properly, rather then the Lords Supper. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse in exactnesse of speech, Baptisme seals no grace, first or second, properly, taking it for propriety of speech, but improperly, because metaphorically, as sealing is taken for assuring. And if properly notes propriety of right, or title, or possession in opposition to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; or that which is alien, I see not how Baptisme doth seal, that is, assure the first grace in respect of the propriety of right more then the second, or more then the Lords Supper. And therefore your speech seems to me very ambiguous: And for the <hi>Minor,</hi> as I conceive, you frame it, that Infants are capable of the first grace as well as grown men, it is true, and so they are of the second, or at least some of them; but both by extraordinary working. As for recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace by ordinary means, they are not capable of one or other. And for the speeches which you heap together, though I grant that in the first conversion, in the sense that some learned men under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it, we are meerly passive; yet I doubt whether D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Twisse,</hi> and such as have most acutely handled the controversie about the irresisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of grace in the first conversion, will subscribe to those speeches of yours, when you say, <hi>all who partake of that grace, are but meer pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, and contribute no more to it, then a childe doth to its own beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; and therefore Infants as fit subjects to have it wrought in them, as
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:43338:84"/>
grown men, and the most grown men are in no more fitnesse to receive this grace when it is given them, in respect either of any faith or repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which they yet have, then a very little childe. What doth the most grown man in any of these, more then an Infant may do? being only passive in them all.</hi> If my memory deceive me not, the Divines of great <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> at the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> in their suffrage, did set down some things which might be done in respect of faith or repentance, when grace is given, by grown men, more then an Infant can do, and so doth in like manner M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Rutherfurd, The Triall and Triumph of Faith,</hi> Serm. 14. pag. 109, 110.

            <p>It is true, the institution of Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. and the practise of <hi>John Baptist,</hi> and the Apostles, are the great objections against Paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptisme; This principle being laid down as a truth avouched against the Papists, by Protestants generally, that it is a sinne of prophaning the Sacraments, when the institution is altered, by substraction, as when the cup is denied to the lay people, or by addition, as when chrisme and spittle, &amp;c. are added to the elements: and by the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists

Of these arguments you answer onely to the two first from institution, and to the last from example; to the first from institution, you answered before, and there I examined your answer, <hi>part.</hi> 3. <hi>sect.</hi> 12, 13. To the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond from institution, and to the last from example, you make some answer here, not denying that the order appointed by Christ is first to teach, and then to baptize: for that is so manifest, that your selfe <hi>page</hi> 35. doe so paraphrase the words, when you say, <hi>expresse command there is, that they should teach the heathen, and the Jewes, and make them disciples, and then baptize them:</hi> nor by denying that <hi>John Baptist,</hi> and the Apostles required expressions of faith and repentance afore Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, nor by denying that the institution of Christ, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles example, are our rule in the administring the Sacraments, so as that we cannot vary from them without will-worship, and propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the worship of God by our inventions: for that is so confessed a truth, that there hath been a great while, scarce a Sermon before the <hi>Parliament,</hi> but hath asserted that rule, and pressed it on the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> and our solemne Covenant supposeth it, the Churches of <hi>Scotland, New-England,</hi> &amp;c. The Sermons in the Citie continually a vow it, and urge it, and upon this ground former and later refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations are urged. But you have two miserable evasions; You say, I answer. <q>
                  <hi>First,</hi> that of Mat. 28. is not the institution of baptisme, it was instituted long before to be the seale of the Covenant, it's only an inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their commission, whereas before they were onely to goe to the lost sheepe of the house of Israel, now they are to goe unto all the world.</q> Whereunto I reply, 1. If this be not the first institution of baptisme, yet it is an institution, and the institution of baptisme to us Gentiles, and therefore the rule by which Ministers are to baptize, there being no other institution that I know of to regulate our practise by, but
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:43338:86"/>
such as is gathered from <hi>John Baptist,</hi> the Apostles practise and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. 2. If institution or appointment of God must warrant our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise in Gods worship, which you once held in the Sermon cited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>part.</hi> 2. <hi>sect.</hi> 9. then you must shew another institution, else you cannot acquit paedobaptisme from will-worship, and your selfe from <hi>breaking the hedge God hath set about the second Commandement.</hi> But you adde further; <q>And beside it is no where said, that none were baptized but such as were first taught, and what reason wee have to believe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, you have before seene. <hi>Your selfe say presently in the next words,</hi> It is said indeed, that they taught and baptized, and no expresse mention of any other, then of the baptisme of persons taught, and you assigne a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of it.</q> And <hi>page</hi> 35. your selfe paraphrase the institution, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Expresse command there is, that they should teach the heathen, and the Jewes, and make them disciples, and then baptize them:</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is no expresse command for any other; and for the reason you have to beleeve that others are to be baptized which are not taught, it hath been examined in the weighing your virtuall conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, which is grounded upon such a principle, as in time you may see to be a dangerous precipice, how ever for the present the great consent of Doctors in the reformed Churches dazzles your eyes; for my part, I cannot yet discerne, but that your grounds for paedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, are worse then the Papists and Ancients, who build it on <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. But you yet adde. <q>Secondly, it is said indeed, that they taught and baptized, and no expresse mention made of any other: but the reason is plaine; there was a new Church to be constituted, all the Jewes who should receive Christ, were to come under another administration:</q> You say right, therefore none other were to be baptized, but taught persons, because though the invisible Church of the Gentiles were joyned to the invisible of the <hi>Jewes, Rom.</hi> 11.17. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.14, 15, 16. <hi>by faith of the Gospel,</hi> as <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.6. it is expounded: yet the outward estate of the Church is new, and as you say, <hi>even the Jewes who should receive Christ, were to come under a new administration,</hi> even those who were <hi>Jewes</hi> by nature and not proselytes, were to be baptized as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane persons, contrary to their former administration, in which they were onely circumcised; and this is a plaine evidence, that the administration of Circumcision, is not the administration under which wee are now, but that it did belong to that administration which is now abolished, which is enough to overthrow all your vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall consequence from circumcision, to baptisme, and consequently
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:43338:86"/>
all the former dispute of your first argument, in which circumcision of infants is indeed the alone prop of baptizing infants. As for that which you adde, "<hi>And their infants were to come in onely in their right.</hi> This overthrows your second argument; for that is grounded upon this, that infants of believers, and particularly infants of believing <hi>Jewes,</hi> such as those are supposed to be <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.14. were partakers of the inward grace of baptisme, and if so, they came in by their own right. But that one mans right to baptisme, should give another right to baptisme, is a position that the Scripture doth not deliver, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraps sundry errors, which I now omit, because it comes in onely upon the by. But you goe on. <q>And the heathen nations who were to be converted to Christ, were yet without the covenant of grace, and their children could have no right, untill themselves were brought in, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no marvaile though both John and Christs disciples and Apostles did teach before they baptized, because then no other were capable of baptisme.</q> In this perioch, you grant many things which doe yeeld the cause; for, 1. you say, <hi>that both John and Christs disciples and the Apostles did teach before they baptized, because then no other were capable of baptisme</hi>; now by this reason you confesse, 1. that baptizing of infants is not according to <hi>Johns</hi> and Christs disciples and Apostles practise; 2. you say, <hi>then no other were capable of baptisme:</hi> Now this is true, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause then there were no children of believers that might be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed: but that is absurd, that in all the time of <hi>Johns</hi> and the disciples and Apostles ministery, believers had no children to be baptized, and contrary to the allegation of <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.14. and other Texts, or because they had no Commission; I cannot conceive how else your speech can be true: But if <hi>John,</hi> the disciples and Apostles had no Commission to baptize infants, neither have we, and so to doe it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have our Ministers any commission, for we have no other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to baptize then they had. But you thinke to salve it thus; <q>But when once themselves were instructed and baptized, then their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were capable of it by vertue of the covenant.</q> Upon which I observe, 1. If the children were capable when once parents were instructed, and baptized, then they were capable, in <hi>Johns,</hi> and the disciples, and Apostles times, and so this speech overthrowes that before, that <hi>then no other but taught persons were capable of baptisme.</hi> 2. When you say, <hi>the children were capable by vertue of the covenant,</hi> it seems you could produce no institution in the new administration, but the institution of circumcision, the validitie of which hath been considered before.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:43338:87"/>
Besides, the covenant being the same at all times, as your Conclus. 1. holds, the children of believers were as capable in <hi>Johns</hi> time as after. So that your words plainly enterfere. But you put a case to be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. <q>If any in the Jewish Church had received commission to goe and make other Cities proselytes to them, their commission must have run thus, Goe teach and circumcise, would it therefore have followed, that none might be circumcised, but such as were first taught?</q> To this I answer, in this commission the precept of circumcising should have had refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the execution of it, either to the old institution of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. and then they had been appointed to circumcise males at eight dayes old not taught, or to a new institution, and then it would have been told more plainly, what they were to circumcise and whom, and so they might have resolved themselves. But what this makes for baptisme of infants, I see not, unlesse it be supposed that baptisme and circumcision are all one, which like the string in the Lampry is an errour that runs along through your whole Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>

Others of them adde, that under an affirmative command, the negative is to be included, believing is the affirmative, unbelieving is the negative, therefore where believers are commanded to be baptized, unbelievers are forbidden to be baptized: this objection they much glory in, and some of them dare all the world to answer it.</q> The objection framed in this later way I own not, and consequently I may well let passe the answer; for the truth is, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.16. is not a command, but an enuntiation; onely that text, with others, specially that, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 37. where when the <hi>Eunuch</hi> asked <hi>Philip, What letteth me to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed?

               <q>BVt suppose they are capable of the inward grace of baptisme, and that God doth effectually worke in some of the infants of believers, is that sufficient warrant for us to baptize all the infants of beleevers? if wee knew in what infants the Lord did worke, then we might baptize those infants, say some of them: but that he doth not make knowne to us, wee cannot know of any one infant by any ordinary way of knowledge, that they are inwardly baptized with the holy Ghost, and therefore wee may not baptize any of them, but waite to see when and in whom God will worke
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:43338:88"/>
the thing signified, and then apply the signe to them.</q> This that you here put among the objections, is rather an exception to your second argument, grounded on <hi>Act.</hi> 10.47. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.17. In answer to which it is granted, that those who have the inward grace, meaning it actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, are not to be debarred of baptisme, for then they are believers and disciples: But then it is rightly added, that this can make no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary rule for baptizing the infants of believers indifferently; sith there is no certainty that any one infant of a believer, now existent, hath the inward grace of baptisme: and it is certain that all have not, and experience sheweth very many have not when they come to age, nor can it be known who have and who have not, but by extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary revelation, which if given, would be sufficient authoritie to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize those infants, though the ordinary rule be not to baptize infants of believers indifferently. As the extraordinary spirit of <hi>Elijah,</hi> and <hi>Phinehas,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> in killing <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> were sufficient authoritie to them to doe those things which agree not with ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rule. And <hi>this I grant to Mr</hi> Blake, <hi>that those that are thus intituled through want of an institution, are not to be excluded:</hi> for according to this supposition, in this case, the institution is cleare for them; for they are sanctified persons, and so believers and disciples of Christ, and besides the extraordinary revelation for that end, would be an institution of that particular act. But the thing that he and you would infer from this concession, is that we may then make it an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary rule to baptize infants. But that can never be; for <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narium non facit regulam communem, That which is extraordinary, makes not a common rule.</hi> If it did, <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> might call for fire from heaven, as <hi>Elijah</hi> did; a man in his zeale might kill a wicked man without a legall triall, as did <hi>Phinehas.</hi> But let us heare what reply you make to this concession, you say thus; <q>Our knowledge that God hath effectually wrought the thing signified, is not the condition upon which we are to apply the signe, God no where required that wee should know, that they are inwardly and certainly converted, whom we admit to the Sacrament of Baptisme, the Apostles themselves were not required to know this of those whom they baptized, if they were they sinned in bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing <hi>Simon Magus, Alexander, Hymeneus, Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> with others: wee are indeed to know that they have in them the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which must warrant us to administer the signe, not that which makes them possest of the thing signified; fallible conjectures are not to be our rule in adminis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:43338:88"/>
knowne rule of the Word, out of which rule wee must be able to make up such a judgement, that our administration may be of faith, as well as out of charity: In baptizing of grown men, the Apostles and Ministers of Christ administred the signe, not because they conjectured, that the parties were inwardly sanctified, but because they made that profession of faith and holinesse, of which they were sure, that whoever had the thing in truth, were received by Christ into inward communion with himself; and that whoever thus made it, that Christ would have them received into the communion of his Church, though possibly, for want of the inward work, they were never received into the inward communion with Jesus Christ. Indeed, when such a confession was made, Christian charity, which alwayes hopeth the best, and thinketh no evill, bound them to receive them, and think of them, and converse with them, as with men in whom the inward work was wrought, untill they gave signes to the contrary: But this their charity, or charitable conjecture, was not the ground of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them to the Ordinance, but the profession and confession of the party made, according to the Word which they were bound to rest in; yea, I greatly question, whether in case <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> could by the Spirit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, have known that <hi>Ananias</hi> or <hi>Alexander</hi> would have proved no better then hypocrites, whether they either would, or ought to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused them from Baptisme, whilest they made that publique profession and confession, upon which others were admitted, who in the event proved no better then those were; so that I conclude, not our knowledge of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward sanctification is requisite to the admitting of any to Baptisme, but our knowledge of the will of Christ, that such, who are in such and such a condition should by us be received into the communion of the Church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To the assertion here delivered, I assent, that not our knowledge, that the person to be baptized hath inward grace, is necessary; but our knowledge of the will of Christ, and the person to be baptized, his having the condition, which is the profession of faith and holiness, is sufficient warrant to baptize him. And I agree, that a judgement of charity, is not that a Minister is to proceed by in this case, but a judgement of faith, as you speak, and of ministeriall prudence: For a Minister in this case is to act as a Steward, who is to deal according to his Lords will, not his own minde, otherwise his own understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or affection, which are but a Lesbian rule, should be his rule, which would be intolerable. Thus far I agree with you: only whereas in the case by you framed, your resolution inclines to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, I rather incline to the affirmative, and conceive they would
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:43338:89"/>
have refused them, and that they ought; because I conceive the end of such an extraordinary revelation would be to warne them not to admit such persons, and so equivalent to a prohibition; and in that case the baptizing them, would be a plain prophaning the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, which is not to be given to Dogs and Swine: And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that which <hi>Chamier</hi> tom. 4. panstra. Cath. lib. 5. c. 15. Sect. 13. speaks in justification of the scrutiny heretofore made in examining the competentes so strictly, confirms this resolution. But to keep to the present businesse, that which is granted, doth neither prove that upon extraordinary revelation of the present inward sanctification of an Infant, that Infant may not be baptized without staying for its profession: For, though it be true that we are not to stay from baptizing them that professe the faith, because we have not a spirit of discerning to know them to be reall Believers, yet we may, having a spirit of discerning that an Infant that cannot professe the faith, yet hath true faith, or is inwardly sanctified, baptize that Infant without staying for his profession, partly, because of the principle used by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Acts</hi> 10.47. and partly, because the revelation of the faith of that Infant to that end, doth authorize that act: Nor doth this conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion advantage you to prove baptizing of Infants by ordinary rule, which is the thing you and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Blake</hi> aim at. But your words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the knowledge of the will of Christ, as the rule of baptizing, rather advantage the Antipaedobaptists, who know no other rule to baptize by, but the condition you truly propound of profession of faith, and therefore conceive your words a good plea for them.</p>
            <p>But you further say: <q>And in this the rule to direct our knowledge, is as plain for Infants as for grown men, the rule having been alwayes this: that grown men, who were strangers from the covenant of God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, Pagans, Heathens, should upon their being instructed, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on profession of their faith, and promise to walk according to the rule of the covenant, be received and added to the Church, and made partakers of the seal of their entrance, and their Infants to come in with them, both sorts upon their admission, to be charitably hoped of, untill they give signes to the contrary, charity being bound from thinking of evill of them, not bound to conclude certainly of any of them, because they ought to know, that in all ages all are not Israel who are of Israel, and that many are called, but few chosen.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That the rule for baptizing Infants should be so plain, as the rule to direct our knowledge about baptizing grown men, professors of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:43338:89"/>
faith, I wonder you should say it, much more that you should preach and print it; sith your selfe confesse, <hi>pag.</hi> 34. <hi>no expresse command in the new Testament that they should be baptized; no expresse example where children were baptized:</hi> but on the other side, <hi>pag.</hi> 35. you say, <hi>expresse command there is, that they should teach the Heathen, and the Jews, and make them disciples, and then baptize them.</hi> And I hope you do not imagine, that a rule gathered by virtuall consequence is so plain as that which is expresse; it may be as true, but it is not possible it should be so plain. But the truth of that additionall rule of Infants coming in with their parents, hath been examined, and as yet it hath been found to me, neither plain nor true.</p>

thoughts, and neerer consideration conceive this to be the meaning, yet I build not on it, as being doubtfull, and in mine apprehension, it rather notes an effect of Baptisme and the resurrection of Christ, then a prerequisite condition; and there are other plain places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alledged which do prove the thing, that the baptized were to professe and promise; or, to use your phrase, seal (which I deny not to be the phrase of <hi>John Baptist,</hi> Joh. 3.33.) as <hi>Acts</hi> 8.37. &amp;c. So that the objection is the same with the second. Now let us see what you answer: you say thus,</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Infants of the <hi>Jews</hi> were as much tied as the Infants of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers under the Gospel, every one who was circumcised, was bound to keep the whole Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. And these men professe that <hi>Israelitish</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were within the old covenant, when yet they knew not what it meant, nor could have the same use of it with their parents and others of discretion; look what answer they will make for the <hi>Jews</hi> Infants if true, will abundantly satisfie for the Infants of Believers under the Gospel.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, this answer serves turn against those that argue from the generall nature of a covenant; but it is no answer against those that only urge Instituton and Apostolicall practice as our rule. As for that which you here, and all along in your Book, suppose that there is the same reason of the mixt covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> as with the pure Covenant of the Gospel, and of every Believer, as of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of Baptisme, as of Circumcision, it is the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>chief error,</hi> which misleads you throughout your Sermon, and makes you speak and write in a dialect, which in the Scripture is unknown. And for that which you say, <q>
                  <hi>that the Infants of the</hi> Jews <hi>were as much tied as the Infants of Believers under the Gospel</hi>;</q> if you mean it of common duties, of Euangelicall obedience, it is true; if you mean it thus (which alone serves for your purpose) that persons to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized now, are no more tied to make profession of faith before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, then Infants of the <hi>Jews</hi> were tied to make profession of faith afore Circumcision, it is false: For, there is now plain Text for the requiring of it before Baptisme, but not before Circumcision. <hi>But you say,</hi> 
               <q>every one that was circumcised was bound to keep the whole Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.</q> True, and therefore circumcision was in the use of it diametrally opposite to the use of Baptisme. <hi>You say,</hi> 
               <q>and these men professe that the Israelitish Infants were within the old Covenant, when yet they knew not what it meant, and then say, look what answer

they will make for the <hi>Jews</hi> Infants, if true, will abundantly satisfie for the Infants of Believers under the Gospel.</q> If you mean this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the reason why the <hi>Christians</hi> Infants should not be baptized, though the <hi>Jews</hi> Infants were circumcised, this is a true and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory answer, that God commanded the one, but no where the other; and your self say, <hi>pag.</hi> 84. <hi>Our knowledge of the will of Christ, is that which is the only direction we are to follow.</hi>

               <hi>this speech is further to be examined.</hi> 'Tis true, <hi>Jesus Christ is the surety of a better Testament,</hi> Heb. 7.12. <hi>he is the surety of all the covenanters, he doth strike hands, and becomes a surety of the whole co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and of every condition in it, take it in the largest sense, and this of all, both on Gods part and ours, as very rightly and excellently</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Thomas Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> in his Teatise intituled, <hi>Christ set forth.</hi> Sect. 3.

It is a very inconsiderate boldnesse in you, to make every baptized person, or at least every baptized Infant of a Believer a covenanter, for whom Christ is a surety, and one to whom God seals, when the Scripture makes Christ the surety only for his redeemed ones, as may be gathered out of sundry places in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>; but I doubt not but when you have considered it a little better, you will easily espie your error in these dictates, and therefore I passe on to the next objection.</p>

            </p>
            <p>It is true, Baptisme is a worship of God; but Paedobaptisme, for ought yet appears, is but a will-worship. Christs Baptisme, it is true, was of a transcendent nature, as is said before; that children are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for the Ordinance, is not to be imputed to their imperfection, but to the defect of Gods appointment; if God did appoint it, there would be no doubt of their fitnesse. But you adde further:</p>
            <p n="3">3. I answer, <q>The benefit and fruit of it at the present, is very much, both to the parents and to the children: to the parents, first, whilest God doth thereby honour them, to have their children counted to his Church, to his Kingdome and Family, and to be under his wing and grace, whilest all the other Infants in the world have their visible standing under the prince, and in the kingdome of darknesse, and consequently, whilest others have no hope of their childrens spirituall welfare, untill they be called out of that condition, these need not have any doubt of their childrens welfare, if they die in their infancy; nor if they live untill they shew signes to the contrary; God having both reckoned them unto his people, and given them all the means of salvation which an Infants age is capable of.</q>All this passage is but dictates; what, or how much of it is true or false, hath been considered before, only that you say;  <q>
                  <hi>all the other Infants of the world have their visible standing under the prince, and in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of darknesse; and consequently, whilest others have no hope of their
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:43338:92"/>
childrens spirituall welfare, untill they be called out of that condition</hi>;</q> If you mean by <hi>all other Infants,</hi> all that are unbaptized, though the Infants of Believers in the Church, it is a very harsh and unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table speech; and you oppose those that in dispute against the <hi>Papists</hi> concerning the necessity of Baptisme to salvation, do hold that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Believers are holy, and in the Church afore they be baptized, and joyn with <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Papists,</hi> denying it; if you mean on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the unbaptized Infants of <hi>Infidels,</hi> what comfort do you give more to believing parents, that have their children baptized, then belongs to them, though their children were not baptized? And when you say, <q>
                  <hi>that all others have no hope of their childrens spirituall welfare,</hi> 
               </q>if you mean it of believing parents that baptize not their children, it is in like manner an uncharitable speech, and doth border too neer on the opinion of the necessity of Baptisme for Infants to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and when you say, <q>
                  <hi>these need not have any doubt of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens welfare, if they die in their infancy,</hi>
               </q> if you mean it of parents, because their children are baptized, you do speak like one that did hold that Baptisme doth <hi>conferre gratiam ex opere operato, conferre grace by the work done</hi>; but for ought you can shew out of Scripture, a believing parent hath as much ground of hope for his Infant that dies unbaptized as for the baptized, and as much reason of doubt concerning the baptized as the unbaptized. And therefore, what you here speak, doth no whit encourage parents to baptize children, if it be well weighed, except there can be proved an institution and a promise. But you say, secondly, <q>here is much priviledge and benefit to the children, when as (beside what inward secret work God is pleased to work in them) they being members of the Church of Christ, have their share in the communion of Saints, are remembred at the Throne of grace every day by those that pray for the welfare of the Church, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, in those prayers which are made for his blessing upon his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By your parenthesis, you intimate <hi>some inward secret work God is pleased to work in the Infants baptized, by Baptisme.</hi> If you conceive a bestowing of grace, <hi>ex opere operato, by the work done:</hi> or, baptismall initiall regeneration of the elect, supposed to be in the Infants in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, notwithstanding till death they live wickedly, speak plainly that we may know what you mean, and then an answer may be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to your spe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ch. As for <hi>being members of the Church,</hi> if you me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n the invisible Church, neither I nor you can affirm or deny; its in
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:43338:92"/>
Gods bosome alone; if you mean the visible, you must make a new definition of the visible Church afore Infants baptized will be proved members. For <hi>their remembring at the Throne of grace daily,</hi> if you mean it particularly, and by name, I do not finde that to be in use after Baptisme any more then afore, and I think they are remembred by the godly in generall as well afore Baptisme as after; and for the <hi>praying for Gods blessing upon his Ordinances,</hi> if Infant-baptisme be not Gods Ordinance, this prayer in reference to Infant-baptisme at that time might be better spared. <hi>You say;</hi> 
               <q>And lastly, it's no small pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to have that seale bestowed on them in their infancy, which may afterwards plead when they are growne, and come to fulfill the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When, where, and how Baptisme should be pleaded, as you shew not, neither doe I well conceive. It is not Baptisme of it selfe that will yeeld a plea of any force, either <hi>in foro soli, in the Court of earth,</hi> or <hi>in foro poli, in the Court of heaven,</hi> but the promise of God, and the condition of faith in Christ.

The plea of the Apostle will hold, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.31, 32, 33, 34. which baptisme rightly administred doth strengthen, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21.

               <hi>YOu say further;</hi> 
               <q>But if their being capable of the spirituall part, must intitle them to the outward signe, why then doe we not also ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, which is the seale of the Covenant of grace, as well as the Sacrament of Baptisme? And this is ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the rather, because (say they) the infants of the Jewes did eate of the Passeover as well as were circumcised; Now if our infants have every way as large a priviledge as the infants of the Jewes had, then can we not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them the same priviledge which their infants had, and consequently they must partake of the one Sacrament as well as the other.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This argument is good, <hi>ad homines,</hi> against the partie opposite, proceeding upon the Paedobaptists hypotheses or suppositions; to wit, 1. <hi>That those to whom the Covenant belongs, to them the seale belongs</hi>; 2. <hi>That to the infants of believers, the Covenant belongs</hi>; 3. <hi>That the Lords Supper is a seale of the Covenant as well as Baptisme.</hi> And these are your hypotheses. Now then if this be a good argument, children are to be baptized, because they are in the Covenant, and the seale belongs to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:43338:93"/>
those in Covenant, by the same reason they are to receive the Lords Supper, because they are in Covenant, and the seale belongs to those in Covenant. Now this argument is strengthened from other hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theses, as that the Lords Supper succeeds the Passeover, as Baptisme Circumcision, but children not of yeares of discretion had the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, therefore they are to hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Lords Supper. And this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the practise and opinion of the Ancients that gave the Lords Supper to infants, for 600 yeares after Christ as well as bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme. To this you say;</p>
            <p>
               <q>I answer, that infants are capable of the grace of Baptisme we are sure, not sure that they are capable of the grace signed and sealed in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This answer supposeth that there is grace sealed in the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which is not sealed in Baptisme. To me that Sacrament that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes the covenant of grace, confirmes all the promises in it, and therefore if Baptisme be the seale of the covenant, it seales all the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and all the promises in it, and therefore you are as sure that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are capable of all graces annexed to the Covenant, as of one. But you say; <q>For both of them are seales of the new Covenant, yet it is with some difference; Baptisme properly seales the entrance into it, the Lords Supper properly the growth, nourishment, and augmentation of it; Baptisme for our birth, the Lords Supper for our food. Now infants may be borne againe while they are infants, have their originall sin pardoned, be united to Christ, have his image stampt upon them; but concerning the exercise of these graces and the augmentation of them in infants while they are infants, the Scripture is altogether silent.</q>
            </p>
            <p>You spake somewhat to like purpose before, which I examined <hi>part.</hi> 3. <hi>sect.</hi> 15. To me it is yet as a paradoxe, that <hi>Baptisme seales pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the entrance into the Covenant, and the Lords Supper, the growth, nourishment, and augmentation of it.</hi> If you make the entrance at re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins, justification, or mortification; the Lords Supper that seales Christs death, seales the entrance into the Covenant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.28. And for Baptisme, it seales dying with Christ, and rising with Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4, 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not onely the first worke of conversion, but also after-growth and exercise of holinesse. And the Lords Supper, signifies the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Spirit, which Baptisme doth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. And according <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o the doctrine of Protestants, Baptisme seales as well the pardon of other sins, as of originall sin. And so <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 2.38. and <hi>Ananias,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:43338:93"/>

And therefore this difference you put, is a difference which the Scripture makes not; that I say nothing of your strange phraseo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of the growth, nourishment, and augmentation of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. But you say; <q>And what is said concerning the infants of the Jewes eating the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, to which our Sacrament of the Lords Supper doth succeed, there is no such thing mentioned in the Book of God. It is said indeed that the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall families were to eate their Lambe, if the houshold were not too little for it, and that when their children should aske them what that service meant, they should instruct them about the meaning of it, but no word in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning, nor any example witnessing tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Commands were, that <hi>all the males should thrice a yeare appeare before the Lord</hi>; one of which was the Passeover, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.17. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.23. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.16.

               <q>If they say as some of them doe, that those little ones who were able to enquire concerning the meaning of that service, and capable to receive instruction about it, did eate of the Passeover with their parents; I answer, (although the Scripture speaks nothing of their eating, yet if that be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) it is no prejudice to us, because the Gospel prohibites not such young ones from the Lords Supper, who are able to examine themselves and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the Lords body.</q>
            </p>
            <p>True; but children that were to appeare at the Passeover, and to partake of it, were many of them such as might be instructed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the meaning of that service, and yet too young to examine
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:43338:94"/>
themselves, or to discerne the Lords body: so that if the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per succeed the Passeover, and a rule may be drawne from the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over to the Lords Supper, children unable to examine themselves, may be admitted to the Lords Supper.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OUR Paper exhibites an Argument for Infant-Baptisme in this form: <q>That may be said to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, without which, that which is written cannot be true. <hi>This I grant.</hi> But that which is said, <hi>Colos.</hi> 2.11, 12. of the compleatnesse, with respect to Ordinances in the new Testament, could not be true, unlesse Baptisme were to Believers children, as Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision was of old; because it cannot be understood of the compleatnesse that Believers have in Christ for salvation; for that the <hi>Jews</hi> had in Christ in the old Testament; but yet they had a token of the Covenant to their children; <hi>Ergo,</hi> so they must now, or else that cannot be true.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This Argument supposeth sundry things, whereof some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what is true, somewhat false.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is true, <hi>That the believing</hi> Jews <hi>were compleat in Christ for salvation.</hi> For so was <hi>David, Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. who were justified by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:43338:96"/>2. It supposeth, <hi>that the Apostle,</hi> Colos. 2.11, 12. <hi>mentions Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, to shew that we are as compleat as the</hi> Jews <hi>in respect of outward Ordinances,</hi> whereas the Apostle speaks not, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. of compleatnesse by reason of outward ordinances, but sayes, we are compleat in Christ without outward ordinances, and that is his very Argument to disswade them from embracing the Jewish ordinances, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. yea, it is plain, that the Apostle makes the <hi>Jews</hi> incompleat by reason of their outward ordinances; and that it is our compleatnesse that we have all in Christ, without outward ordinances, <hi>vers.</hi> 17. Nor doth the Apostle mention Baptisme, to shew that we are equall to the <hi>Jews</hi> in outward ordinances, (for the Apostles assertion is, that we are compleat in Christ, exhibited without outward ordinances, and so the better for want of them) but to shew how we put on Christ, and so are compleat in him, and therefore he mentions Faith as well as Baptisme; as in like manner he doth. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26, 27. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, &amp;c. Besides, if that by being baptized we are compleat in outward ordinances, then we need no other ordinance, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Lords Supper should be needlesse.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is supposed, <hi>that Circumcision was a token of the Covenant to their children.</hi> But this is ambiguous, in some sense it is true, in some sense it is not true. It was a token of the Covenant made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> to wit, First, that God made such a Covenant with <hi>Abraham.</hi> Secondly, that God required them to keep the conditions of it. But it is not true in these senses. First, that every person circumcised, or to be circumcised, of right had a title to the promises of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. Secondly, that this title to the promises of the Covenant was the reason why they were circumcised.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is supposed, <hi>that if our children have not a token of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant now, as the</hi> Jews <hi>had, that it cannot be true that we are compleat as the</hi> Jews. But there is not a shadow of proof for it in the Text. And it is grounded on these false assertions: First, that the <hi>Jews</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were in the Covenant of Grace, because they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> naturall seed. Secondly, that a Believers children now are in the Covenant of Grace, because they are a Believers children; which things are expresly contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is supposed, <hi>that the</hi> Jews <hi>having salvation by Christ, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a compleatnesse by outward ordinances.</hi> It is true, that compared with the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that served dumb Idols, they were compleat by reason
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:43338:96"/>
of outward ordinanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s: For, their outward ordinances did shadow Christ to come, and so did not the Rites of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> But com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with Christians since Christ manifested in the flesh, so they were incompleat in respect of outward ordinances; and so the Apostle determines, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is supposed, <hi>that without a succession of some ordinance in stead of Circumcision, we are not compleat in Christ, or, at least, not so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat as the</hi> Jews. But this I account to be false, and very dangerous.</p>
            <p n="1">1. False, because it is contrary to that which the Apostle asserts, that we are compleat in Christ alone, because in him is the fulnesse of all that was shadowed in the ordinances of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is very dangerous, because the same reason that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that we are not compleat without a succession of some ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in stead of Circumcision, will conclude, we are not compleat without a succession of something in stead of sacrifices, Temple, Priest, Altar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so after the Popish manner, all Jewish Rites may be reduced under new names, which would overthrow Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie.</p>
            <p>As for our compleatnesse in Christ without outward ordinances, like to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> I distinguish of a twofold compleatnesse.</p>
            <p>First, in all the will of God, <hi>Colos.</hi> 4.12. And thus we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat without such ordinances: we may do all the will of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Christ, without observing any of those ordinances.</p>
            <p>Secondly, of means, <hi>in ordine ad finem, in order to the end,</hi> that is, to the knowledge of God, and obtaining salvation: And so we are more compleat then the <hi>Jews</hi> without those outward ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or any answerable to them.</p>
            <p>First, because they had Christ only promised and assured, we have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hrist exhibited, and fulfilling all things. And surely they that have a promise accomplished, are compleater then they that have it only assured, let it be assured never so firmly.</p>
            <p>Secondly, because they had Christ under shadows, we the body, <hi>Colos.</hi> 2.17. he is the true <hi>Shecinah,</hi> or <hi>Divine Majesty,</hi> in whom the fulnesse of the glory of God dwelt, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9. he was circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, sacrifices, all. And the woman is more compleat that enjoyes her husband in person, then in a picture, messenger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent him. The <hi>Jews</hi> were compleat in Christ as we, <hi>quoad rem, in respect of the thing,</hi> but not <hi>quoad modum, &amp; mensuram rei, in respect
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:43338:97"/>
of the manner and measure thereof.</hi> So that in the Argument, these Propositions are to be denied:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Colos.</hi> 2.11, 12. speaks of compleatnesse, with respect to Ordinances in the new Testament.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it could not be true, unlesse Baptisme were to Believers children, as Circumcision was of old.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That <hi>Colos.</hi> 2.11, 12. cannot be understood of the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that Believers have in Christ for salvation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In some sense it is to be denied that the <hi>Jews</hi> had a token of the Covenant to their children.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In what sense it is to be granted that the <hi>Jews</hi> had a token of the Covenant to their children, in that sense the consequence is to be denied, that we must have a token of the Covenant of Grace for our children now.</p>

                  <hi>Pag. 50.</hi> There are many of the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> to whom the word of promise doth not belong, as <hi>Ismael,</hi> and <hi>Ismaelites.</hi> But if so there be many of the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> to whom the word of promise doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, then the rej<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that promise understood of spirituall blessing, pertaines not to the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but to the spirituall, as the Apostle himselfe hath interpreted it, <hi>Rom. 4. &amp; 9.</hi> For if you understand the carnall seed, now that promise will belong to none of the Gentiles, but to those alone who are begotten of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi> according to the flesh.</p>
               <p>He teacheth also that the promises of God are not tied to the carnall birth; but to belong onely to the believing and spirituall posterity. For they are not the sons of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who are of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the flesh, but who are according to the spirit.</p>

               <p>The believing wife may with a good conscience keep company with the unbelieving husband (for why should anothers conscience defile her?) Therfore it is said, the unbelieving not in himself, but in his wife (that is, in respect of his wife) is holy. The same we are to judge of the other member.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 74.</hi> This is the minde of the Apostle that he may teach, that the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is not to depart from the unbelieving yokefellow, consenting to dwell together. For proving of which an argument from an uncertain event, and by accident is equally unfit as a little before. Hence that opinion is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed that then when the unbeliever shall be converted, holy children will be begotten. For what if that never be?</p>

The Apostle hath said, that if the unbelieving husband be not sanctified in the believing wife, it will be that the children borne from thence are uncleane. Therefore all so borne are uncleane, or else the Apostle spake false. What then? Are all borne of those parents whereof one is not sanctified in the other begotten in the monethly courses? Doe unbelieving husbands never use their wives but in their monethly courses? So it must be verily, or this interpretation is ridiculous.</p>
               <p>Of that Covenant-holinesse what shall I say?

The Apostle hath said, that if the unbelieving husband be not sanctified in the believing wife, it will be that the children borne from thence will be uncleane. Therefore all that are so borne are uncleane, or the Apostle hath said that which is false. What then?

It was knowne to the <hi>Jews</hi> that God hath been wont to give this honour to Prophets, that he would bestow his gifts on others at the Prophets prayers, of which imposition of hands was a signe. It is manifest also from <hi>Gen. 48.14, 15.</hi> that in that rite pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were wont to be conceived for children. Thence it hath been alwayes observed by the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that they would bring children to those, who were believed to excell others in holinesse, to be commended in their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God by laying on of hands: which custome as yet continues with them.
