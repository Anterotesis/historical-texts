            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of your highnes moſt ſingular ornaments
of mynde and body, of arte and nature, of
grace &amp; fortune, I meane not, nor may not.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17471:4"/>
It is too deepe a ſea for me to wade in: too
large a feild for me to walke in. Theirfore,
ſyth therof ſpeake as I ought I cannot: as I
can, I will not. As in the one I acknowledge
it my weaknes and imbecillitie, ſo in the o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
I am lead by diſcretion and iudgment.
For in the reſplendeny of your excellency,
vaine were it in me, &amp; friuelous (in vttering
my ſle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der conceipt,) to light as it were a can<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dle
to diſcouer the Sunne. But whatſoeuer
we can, let vs doe it in your ſeruice: whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer
we may, let vs deuiſe for your ſafetye.</p>
               <p>The ſafetye of your Maieſtie doth moſt
conſiſt in preſeruation of your moſt royall
perſon, and of your eſtat. Your perſon
and eſtate are beſt preſerued by cuttinge off
the perils that would moſt annoy them. The
eſtate of your highnes is a free monarchy, a
ſoueraigne and abſolute power, and authori<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty
inſtituted and ordained of God: for the
defence of the good, and puniſhment of the
euell, and for the gouerment of all in pietie
and Iuſtice.</p>
               <p>This your ſoueraigne eſtat is dangerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
impeached with the perill of your perſon

Prelat: whoſe riches in times paſt, hath bene

our pouertie: whoſe puiſaunce, our terror:
whoſe doctrine, our deſtruction. Theſe are
are they that loath manna, and long for the
fleſhpots of Egeipt: that loue the tongue of
the Caldies, better then the language of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan:
that madded with mallice, or blinded

two thinges, They end whereat they
ſhoote, and the meane they vſe to attaine to
that end.</p>
               <p>The end for which they would advaunce
their tyranny, is, that theirby they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioye
their groues and hill altars, that therby
they might honor againe the wholl hoſt of
heauen, and that therby they might returne
againe to their ſuperſtious Idolatrie &amp; blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
religion.</p>
               <p>The meanes wherby they would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
it, is, the death of your maieſtie, and the
erecting of a fauouring ſucceſſor, whervnto
tend all their deuiſes. This is their drift and
practiſe while there remaineth in them any
ſparke of hope to attaine to this end, or any
conceipt (I will not ſay of probabillitie) but
of poſſibilitie to atchiue it. what law ſoeuer
we make to puniſh them they will ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in theire pernitious practiſſes, and your
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17471:5"/>
maieſties moſt ſacred perſon ſhall ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
in perill. But if your maieſtie cutt off
their hope, and make it apparently impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for theire religion euer to take place in
this realme, their indeuour will forthwith ſur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceaſe,
the ſtate wilbe clere from theire deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and your maieſtie freed from danger.</p>
               <p>The onlye way in mine oppinion to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
their hopes, and theirby theire practi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes,
and ſo conſequently the perill of your
moſt ſacred perſon, is, to eſtabliſh a firme
continuance &amp; perpetuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſubſtance
and ſinceritie of doctrine now profeſſed in
this realme, which me thinkes is ſenſible, and
is to be donne by generall lawes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by generall
league, and by generall oth. To which end it
it would be enacted, that all gentlemen, ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>giſtrats,
and poſſeſſioners within this realme
ſhall take the oth of aſſociation, for the de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fence
and perpetuation of religion now pub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liquelye
profeſſed within this realme. And
that the oth of ſupremacy be miniſtred with
like addition to all men generally within this
realme, from the age of 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yeares vpwards,
twice everie yeare, by the maiors and gouer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ners
of citties, townes, and corporations, &amp;

into ſuch league or oth, that euery ſuch
perſon ſhalbe holden and reputed as ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed,
and ſhalbe theirby diſabled to beare any

and ſhall alſo be bound to his good behaui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>our,
ſequeſtred from all his armour and wea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pons,
and (if he be poſſeſſed of landes within

the fourth part theirof. This payne &amp;
ſuch others as your maieſtie ſhall like of to
indure, during his obſtanacie, and vpon his
conformitie to ceaſe.</p>
               <p>By this meanes, their hope being taken a
way, I make no doubt but their practiſe will
end. But ſo longe as theire hope endureth,
they will neuer giue ouer their deuelliſh at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.
If <hi>Brutus</hi> had not hoped to ſet <hi>Rome</hi>

ſhall eaſilie diſcouer theire ſpite &amp; rancor to

hath ſent out againſt your highnes his flame

of falſhood and furie, of bitternes and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minie.
His will therin hath bene to depriue
your maieſtie of your eſtate, gouerment,

to drawe vnto himſelfe fauorers &amp; followers
within our realme: to diſcharg your ſubiects

yow: to withdraw them from your obeidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

               <p>To this end he ſent, firſt his <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi>

induced ſome to actuall rebellion, &amp; ſome

               <p>Great is the force of truth, and often dri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth
the aduerſarie to acknowledge it. And
great is the ſubtiltie of ſathan, who ſomtims
ſpeaketh that that is true, becauſe he would
be beleeued in that that is falſe. The papiſtes
as vngratious herein as theire grandfather,
doe ſometimes acknowledge your moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler

the more is your perill. Out of theſ 2. and 3.
the increaſe of the 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 4 muſt grow. for
they are as it were two heapes of ſtones that
muſt goe to the buildinge either of Sion or
Babell. Their progreſſes, or diſpoſitions are
wrought or ſtaid, haſtened or ſlowed by cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine
motiues or motiones: &amp; they are of 2.
ſorts, externall or internall. the externall mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiues
on the on ſid be doctrine &amp; diſcipline
the on the word of life, the other the worke
of law: the on the ſheepards voice, the other
the ſheepards hooke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the on in the mouth of
the miniſter, the other in the hand of the
magiſtrat: in the one is contained the preach<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
of the truth, in the other all good lawes
for the eſtabliſhment and maintenance their
of. The externall motiues on the other ſide,
is the doctrine of error and ſuperſtition: the
pollicies and practiſes of impietie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:17471:8"/>
The internall motiues are of two ſortes,
naturall, and ſupernaturall. the ſupernaturall
motiues on the one ſide, is the operation of
the holy ghoſt: on the other ſide, the ſuggeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
&amp; ſubtilties of ſathan. the naturall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
is <hi>appetitio boni.</hi> How the 2 and 3 band,
that is to ſay, the proteſtants of eſtat and pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>piſts
of eſtat, eſtabliſh their <hi>ſummum bonum</hi>
in this world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and define it to be a life lead in
wealth: pleaſure reputation and authoritie.
In the appetition hereof they both agree. In
the acquiſition they varie. For, the papiſts of
eſtat: conceiuing great brittlement and vncer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taintie
in the courſe of this preſent gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which he ſuppoſeth cannot longe laſt,
for that he deſireth to haue his <hi>ſummum bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>
perdurable, he will not haſſard it in this
preſent, but will now laye his foundation
long before, to inioye it in the future. to that
end he will now be a fauourer to papiſtes of
religion: he will retaine ſome of them that be
moſt famous or rather moſt infamous on
this ſide and beyond the ſeaes: he will giue
ſome token of preſent diſcontentment: he
will incur the diſpleaſure of ſome great man
of the eſtate that fauoureth the contrarie,
and he will doe whatſoeuer els may make
him a man of note, whereby he may notably
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17471:9"/>
be accepted off in the future.</p>
               <p>The proteſtant of eſtate (thinkinge it
teadious to tarrie, and frutleſſe to truſt to
dead mens ſhooes,) reſolueth to taſt of the
preſent ſweete, offereth his ſeruice in moſt
dutifull ſorte vnto your maieſtie, frameth
himſelfe vnto the time, aſſocyateth himſelfe
with ſuch as are proteſtantes of religion, in
ſinuateth himſelfe into the fauour of ſome
great man that is fauourer thereof, hopeth
to attaine wealth, reputation and authoritie
therby, &amp; herewith becometh a ſeruiceable
member of the eſtat, though as yet no true
member of the church. But for that he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
himſelfe vnto the externall motiues
it is to be hoped that in time he wilbe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
and effectually called, and ſo made
a member of the miſticall body of Chriſt: for
out of theſe gentiles is gathered the Iſraell
of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as the diſpare of the future and
hope of the preſent produceth proteſtants
of eſtat, ſo diſpayre of the preſent &amp; hope of
the future producerh papiſts of eſtate, now
if the hope of the future be taken away, and
all meanes vſed for the perpetuation of the
preſent, there is no doubt but all papiſts of
eſtate will become proteſtants of eſtate.</p>
               <p>For ſyth they eſtabliſh their <hi>ſummum bonum</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:17471:9"/>
in this world, thether their inward motiue
of <hi>appetitio boni</hi> muſt needes bringe them.</p>
               <p>It is not vnprobable, that of the papiſts in
this land, the 4 part are not papiſts of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The reſt then (being papiſts of eſtate) be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>inge
by this law taken from them, theire po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
muſt needes remaine much weakened
by this leſſeninge of their number. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,

cleane from them the 3. Further, whereas
ſome of them at this preſent, publiquelye

others lye hid as it were in the ambuſh of
their diſſimulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and trenches of treachery
readye through all loope holes of oportuni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie
to annoy vs: we by this law ſhall remoue
the 1, diſcouer the 2, and drawe out both
vnto the open view, where being warned of
them we may be armed for them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, wheras heeretofore they haue caſt

to carry away cattell and goods, and to haue

<hi>Dolman</hi> diuids and diſcribes them) <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi>
viz. ſuch as depend vpon eccleſiaſtical dig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nities,
and <hi>Puritans,</hi> viz. ſuch as pretend perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

the courſe of times, &amp; remember, that when the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17471:14"/>
                  <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> liued, it went for currant,
that all Papiſts were Traitors in action, or affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He was no ſooner dead, But <hi>Sir Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
Hatton</hi> (noted by <hi>Philopater, for publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que,
and bitter invectiues, againſt papiſts, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
one himſelfe)</hi> he bearing ſwaye. Puritans
were trounced, and traduced as troublers of the
ſtate: Preſently after his death, there comes forth
(by meanes of the late <hi>Lord Treaſurer)</hi> a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
and commiſſions throughout the land
to inquire for Prieſts, for their receiuers, recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants:
and ſuch like, leaſt if they were not looked

of prepared papiſts, ſhould proue too true, at
the ſpaniſh ſecond inuaſion then intended.</p>
               <p>But now that that <hi>Lord Treaſurer</hi> is gone,
and the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> through his fatall error,
taken away, the cry is: <hi>Preiſts be tolerable
men,</hi> but <hi>Puritans may not be abidden.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<hi>(I</hi> ſay: and pray) theſe thinges: And
conſider, Whether a Snake lurkes not vnder the
graſſe, and whether there be not ſome crafty <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
of <hi>Sir Chriſtopher Hattons</hi> stampe, (as
it is imprinted by <hi>Philopater)</hi> who maketh
way to theſe <hi>Troian</hi> horſſes, the popiſh Bookes. If
this may be ſuppoſed, I beſeech your Lordſhips
enter into this further conſideration, that if di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17471:15"/>
betwene proteſtants and puritans be avial<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>able
for Popery, the contrary muſt needs be good
for the preſeruation of religion eſtabliſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But
if it may pleaſe your Lordſhips to giue me leaue,
to ſignifie the cauſe, why they thus peſwade the
oppreſſion of puritans, I doubt not, but that yee
will feare his feare, who ſaid: <hi>Timeo Danaos
vel dona ferentes,</hi> and ſuſpect the perſwaſion
of ſuch enimies, as with whom it is a ground of
policie (as well in peace as <hi>in</hi> warr) <hi>Dolus an
virtus, quis in hoſte requirit,</hi> and a <hi>Conſtant
Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that faith is not to be keept with here
tiques.</hi> The cauſe is ſufficiently bewrayed in
the wardword, and anſwer to a Ieſuited gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
to witt: that wheras they take the puritans
to be their grateſt oppoſits, they would haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
(eſpecially knowne profeſſors) to be kept downe.
<hi>Quouſque? while the catholike parttie</hi> (to vſe
their owne words) <hi>may haue ſome ſwaye in
the ballance with them.</hi> In which cauſe, let vs
obſerue three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt they pretend to hold only the puritans
for their oppoſits, As if your Lordſhips could be
content to giue way to their toleration, and yet
they cannot but take knowledge (and that with
ſome ſignification of their feeling) of that worthy
Prelate the Lord Biſhop of Dureſme his godly
exhortation at Pauls croſſe againſt toleration,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17471:15"/>
they cannot but (in their <hi>Quodlibets)</hi> ſcorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
terme the godly ſermon of that reuerend
father the <hi>Biſhop of Cheſter a preachme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,</hi> &amp;
report him to be a <hi>pvritans</hi> for inueighinge a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainſt
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at <hi>Pauls croſſe,</hi> equallyas againſt the
Ieſuits. and they cannot but ioyne (even in theſe
Bookes) <hi>Caluiniſts with Puritans,</hi> Now this
word <hi>Caluiniſts</hi> comprehendeth <hi>Proteſtants</hi>
as well as <hi>Puritans,</hi> So that we may gather,
that (when their time ſerueth) they will ſpeake
out that, which <hi>Briſtow</hi> in his motiues writeth,
viz. <hi>That we are all puritans in hart.</hi> But
your Lordſhips are wiſe to conclude, that if the
<hi>Admirant</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi> ſpared the papiſts no
more then other in the borders of <hi>Germany,</hi> &amp;
if it be true (which the prieſts now report) That
the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Medina</hi> ſaid, that if he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed
againſt <hi>England</hi> with his invincible <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mado.</hi>
He would haue ſpared papiſts no more
than proteſtants, but make way for his maiſter.
Then they will not ſpare your Lordſhips, in their
golden or bloudy day; though ye ſhould plead ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer
ſo earneſtly, that ye are L. Biſhops, and no
puritans.</p>
               <p>To this end is the ſecond note to be obſerued.
to wit, that knowne profeſſors are ſpecially aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at. And here <hi>I</hi> pray yow remember, <hi>that Ed<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward
Squyre</hi> was ſent to poyſon her Maieſtie
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17471:16"/>
(whom God preſerue) as well as the <hi>Earle of
Eſſex:</hi> Is our gratious Queene a puritan? Nay
was the Earle a puritan, who was lead by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
in his ſinnfull attempt, and at his arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
miſliked puritans opinion touching Church
gouernment. No no, it is evident, that all be puri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tans
with them, which stand for the goſpell. And
therefore <hi>Dolman</hi> in his epiſtle, doth cunning<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
inſinuate, &amp; aduiſe to make the Earle away:
as if he had written to this effect. If her Maieſtie
were dead, wee were not a whit the nearer
our purpoſe, ſo long as Eſſex is in place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if
we could be rid of him, there were none of like po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>licy,
valor, reſolution, authority, and ſauor with
the people, to hold the proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts together againſt
the <hi>Infanta<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and popery. According to which in
ſinuation (for a ſigne is as good as a ſentence to
prepared mindes) frendes of <hi>Spayne</hi> (when <hi>Squi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers</hi>
poyſon fayled) working vpon the Earles im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiency,
by meanes and deuiſes drew him to
that attempt of making a forcible way to preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
his ereifes to her Maieſtie. This is held for truth
<hi>S. Robert Cicill</hi> avouching as much at <hi>Cuffes</hi>
arraignment) howſoeuer the anſwerer to the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuited
gentleman dare ſware (contrary to that
which is publiſhed by authority and commonly
knowne) that papiſts partakers in the Earles deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtrous
action, were drawne they knew not wher
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17471:16"/>
vnto, and yet none but papiſts were appointed to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward
the vtter court gate, the hall, and preſence,
and to kepe the Honorable perſonages, whom her
Maieſtie ſent to the Earle, and none but ſuch cry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>kill them, kill them, caſt the great Seale
out of the window &amp;c.</hi> Well the Lord of Lords
preſerue the <hi>L. Mountioy,</hi> from the like diuliſh
practiſes of the frends of <hi>Spayne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third thing to be conſidered (as a moſt da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rous
mater) is, that the papiſts diſcouer ami<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to
make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g enough, to incou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter the Pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
that is, all that stand in their way as hath
bene ſhewed, to which end, their deſignes haue
reſpect, as ſhall be ſome what ſhewed hereafter.</p>
               <p>But it may be obiected, that this contention be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tween
ſecular Prieſts and Ieſuits, cannot but
cauſe a diſ-vnion amongſt the lay Papiſts, and
therefore weaken their party. I would grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the
concluſion, if <hi>I</hi> could beleue the premiſes, viz.
that there were ſuch a contention indeed, &amp; that
therby the lay Papiſts were diuided. It may be,
there was ſome hart burning (at the firſt) occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
by the Ieſuits ambition, and deſire of au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thority
ouer the Prieſts, But now advantage is
made of this pretended continuance by diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion,
that: our fearefull eyes, &amp; troubled thoughts
being ſet vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Ieſuits: the Preiſts may be leſſe
feared, and more fauoured, as <hi>I</hi> am perſwaded
by theſe probabilities.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:17471:17"/>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> if the <hi>Pope</hi> can diſpence with Papiſts
their being miniſters in our Churches, prouided
they maintai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e ſome one poynt of popery or other,
with theire being Magiſtrats in our common
wealth, prouided they (vnder hand) hinder pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
againſt papiſts: and (at the motion of
<hi>Parſons</hi> and <hi>Campion)</hi> with their being (in
ſhew) obedient ſubiects not withſtanding the <hi>Bul
of Pius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Quintus</hi> to the contrary, prouided they
be ready to rebell, when time ſhall ſerue, Is it
vnlikely that he will diſpence with this pretend<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
contention, wher by he may hope to advance
his popery more than by forcible meanes: and
the rather if the Ieſuits aduiſe the ſame, which
(it may be) they haue done. For they be knowne
macheuilliſts, and therfore carcles what they do,
ſo they may bring their pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cipall deſire to paſſe:
they are few in England, and not eaſilie found
out: they know that any thing wilbe receiued a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainſt
them, &amp; yet impaire their credii no more
than it was before, becauſe of the generall preiu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dice
againſt them, and if their credit were here<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by
ſomewhat wounded, they can heale them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues
when they will, and (perhaps) by the Scor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pions
tale that wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded them. But if the <hi>Infanta</hi>
prevaile, they may make accompt to be glorified
for their practiſes againſt this ſtate, as <hi>Thomas
Becket</hi> was, for his treacherous dealing againſt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17471:17"/>
                  <hi>King Henry the ſecond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe I cannot ſee how it can be poſſible,
that Prieſts ſhould be faithfull to the ſinagogue
of Rom, and continue in fauour with the Pope,
and yet (without diſpenſation) publiſh (&amp; that
amongſt vs) theſe volems, wherin their holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
is ſomewbat touched, his darlings the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its
ſhamefully traduced, and all the treaſonable
practiſes of papiſts againſt our state, (in ſundry
Popiſh diſcourſes heretofore refuted as fictions
and deuiſes be now graunted <hi>de facto,</hi> but laif
(forſooth) vpon Ieſuits: and there Ieſuited compli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces,
that is (as time will manifeſt) all Prieſts &amp;
papiſts. For the prieſts themſelues complaine (even
in theſe Bookes) if ye will beleeue them) that lay
papiſts (in a manner) faile them, for the Ieſuits
ſake, and it is ſtrange, that Seminary prieſts, who
in their ſupplication to her Maieſtie, printed <hi>An
no.</hi> 1595. doe glory that <hi>Cardinall Allen</hi> (that
perſwader &amp; iuſtifier of the spaniſh invaſion in
88) was their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der: &amp; that they were brought
vp vnder the Ieſuits, ſhould be now at deadly
feud with them? No no, their exceſſiue writing
(as if they did not beleue themſelues) will ever 
be thought but counterfeite quarreiting, except
by their meanes, the <hi>Archpriſt,</hi> or ſome of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſuits
be brought to their triall. And the rather:
becauſe the Ieſuits, who want nether ſtomach
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17471:18"/>
nor meanes, play mum budget though they be ſo
notoriouſly provoked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly it is to be obſerued, that this deuiſe to
lay all treaſonable practiſes vpon the Ieſuits
was never put in execution before now. Indeede<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
a follower of S. <hi>Chriſtopher Hatton</hi> conceiued
ſuch a matter long ſince, Which, with like deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
may (perhaps) be diſplayed, when all theſe
Popiſh Bookes be abroad, In meane while, may
it pleaſe your Lordſhips to remember: that the Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſuits
(and Father <hi>Parſons</hi> by name) be iuſtified
as by the wardword not long ſince publiſhed by
<hi>H. H.</hi> and not by <hi>Parſons</hi> as I haue credibly
heard: and by ſundry treatizes of particular per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſons,
ſo by the generall commendation of Prieſts
in their ſupplication before mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ed. Wherfore
then (at the fartheſt) it may be vnderſtood, that
the Prieſts (as is confeſſed in the preface to the
<hi>Quodlibets)</hi> were <hi>willing</hi> not onely to <hi>couler
&amp; conceale</hi> but alſo to <hi>make the Ieſuits their
attempts, and practiſes their owne in euery
thing.</hi> Which being ſo, It cannot be true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That
the prieſts diſcarded Ieſuits &amp; their practiſes:
<hi>when they were equally entangled by penal lawes,</hi>
as in the ſaid preface it is inſinuated, but
without prayſe to the prieſts, who ſtucke to the Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſuits
ſo long at leaſt. For all thoſe penall lawes
were in execution before the imprinting of that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17471:18"/>
ſupplication. Nay, ſith by the proclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which
they would refute by that ſupplication, they are
charged with treaſonable practiſes, why did not
they then lay loade on the Ieſuits, to eaſe their
owne ſhoulders? So that it ſeemeth to me more
than evident that this deuiſe is but a new point
of popiſh policy.</p>
               <p>Moreover, It is not to be forgotten. That <hi>Squire</hi>
confeſſed, that <hi>VValpoole</hi> the Ieſuit remitted
him to <hi>Doctor</hi> Bagſhaw (one of theſe Prieſts)
for direction in his poyſonfull affaire, and that
Prieſts (who dare ſware as is aforeſaid) can con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary
themſelues when they will for a purpoſe.</p>
               <p>For when the Scotiſh <hi>Queene</hi> lived, then her ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
was the cleareſt, but after her death none but
the Infanta hath right to this crowne, and <hi>Allen</hi>
(founder of the Seminaries) found fault with
<hi>Saunders</hi> and Briſtow for iuſtifiyng the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the North, by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> his Bull, and yet
the ſame <hi>Allen</hi> iuſtified <hi>S. VV. Stanly</hi> his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
<hi>Deuenter,</hi> by the ſame Bull.</p>
               <p>Laſtly if this contention be hearty and not poli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tique,
I maruell there ſhould be ſo great an agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
amonge the laye Papiſts, conſidering the
pretended contention hath bene longe, and (in
ſhew) is to too vehement, the Ieſuits be few, and
the Prieſts many, &amp; well maintained in priſon,
and abroad (notwithſtanding the ſaid prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded
complaining) the Ieſuits are knowne to be for
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17471:19"/>
the Infanta, and the aide of 30000. Papiſts, is
ſaid to haue bene offered the Scottiſh King, (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they would gull by theſe pamphlets) if he would
promis toleration.</p>
               <p>If <hi>I</hi> be demaunded, what ende beyond the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beareing
of Prieſts (a matter of no great mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t)
may be ſuppoſed worthy a ſtrategeme ſo ſtrange,
myne anſwere is ready, to wit. The Prieſts (not
maintained by the Pope, &amp; ſpaniſh King in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries
for nought) haue promiſed to aide for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
forces (when they ſhalbe landed) with for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty
thowſands: as <hi>S. Robert Cicill</hi> reported this
Parliament. That this may be made good, The
worke of reconciling to the Pope muſt needs be
applied, and theirfore all hands muſt be ſett on
worke, that prieſts therefore, (who are moſt in no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber)
may ply their buſines, and be leſſe looked vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to,
it ſeemeth good in policy, to turne the eyes of
the magiſtrate, and edge of the ſword vpon ſome,
and none ſo fitt as the Ieſuite &amp; Puritan alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in diſgrace with the state. Here (by the way)
it may be inquired, why they ioyne purita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s with
Ieſuits: I anſwere, to fill our heads &amp; hands the
fuller of feare and worke, and peradventure, to
trump in the puritans way, leaſt they be likewiſe
tolerated (as reaſon is) if the papiſts hap (as the
prieſts hope) to obtaine toleration. But to returne
to the matter, I remember a diſtinction in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
poſicon maintained before the late Earle of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17471:19"/>
Huntiugdon: That howſoever Prieſts are execut<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
(indeed) for affirming the Pops primacy, and
reconciling to the Church of Rome (which are
parts of their prieſtly function) yet they are not
executed for theſe parts as they are religious, but
as they be dangerous to the state, in ciuill conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.
The reaſon is evident, For if Dolman
make accompt of country people as of papiſts &amp;
partiza<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, though they be not abſolute papiſts, but

Vdall</hi> preacher of the goſpell who leſſe offended.</p>
               <p>But it is ſaid that ſome of the prieſts be gon to
procure abſolution for her Maieſtie, or the cancel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling

(if it proue not flat treaſon) is offered to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ieſtie.
For be it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

dangerous attempts, to provoke her to graunt

It muſt needs be that the honor of her Maieſtie

and theirby the Pope and spaniard in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged

their credit with her Maieſtie, hope, partly by
feares procured, and partly by conditionall abſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lution,

<hi>The Lion being taken out of the way, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts

haſtened. And the rather this feare may be con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceived,
if it be true, that the prieſts are gone to
<hi>Rome</hi> to ſue an appeale with the privity &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent,
of ſome in authority, as in the ſaid anſwer
it is ſignified with hop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Now your LL. may iudge, whether I may not be
probably perſwaded, that this contention betweene
Prieſts and Ieſuits is diſpenſed with, &amp; tendeth to
the increaſing &amp; not diminiſhing of the popiſh part<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty.
And therfore the due conſideration therof may
draw (rather then divert) your LL. to this perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on:
That by incitting the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t agaiuſt the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi>
they would weaken the party againſt them, &amp;
ſtrengthen their owne: and the rather your LL. may
be thus perſwaded ſith they cannot but intimate
in theſe books that the papiſts haue multiplied, ever
ſince ſome of your LL. haue curbed the Puritans.</p>
               <p>Wherfore (as ye haue a faithfull eye to the meaine
chaunce, &amp; loue the goſpell from your harts) take
heed how any of yow hearten the Papiſts, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag
the Puritan (nay every ſound Proteſttant)

is it good policy to reſtore the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this declining time
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (God wot) the papiſts haue no need of helpe or

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17471:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
betwene you &amp; the <hi>papiſts,</hi> whoſe doctrine is poy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon
in the roote, and treaſon in the fruite? Wheras
the bone which the Divill hath caſt betwene yow
and the puritans, is but of the off alls of the whore
of Babilons peace offrings. I hope I may thus
ſpeake without offence, For I know, that ſome of
your LL. (&amp; I doubt not but moſt of yow, be of
the ſame mind) doe iudg, as I doe, of ceremonies:
about which all this wrangling is. O my Lords?
doth the 50. Iniunction stratly forbid (for peace
ſake) the vſing of theſe termes, <hi>papiſts and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique?</hi>
and is there not gieater reaſon, that ſome
courſe be taken, that Proteſtants may no longer
(without rebuke) reproch one another (to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing
of Papiſts) with <hi>Puritan, and Formaliſt,
Preciſian and Timeſeruer?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here I imagine ſome enemy of the Puritan, &amp;
frend of the papiſt (who often meete in one coate)
will readily anſwer, &amp; ſay: that it was policy not
to provoke the papiſts in the begining of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie
raigne, ſith then: they were many &amp; migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
I reply, &amp; affirme: That for the ſame reaſon, it
is not good in policy to provoke the purita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, in the
declining of her Maieſties age, &amp; raigne: when
it is more than high time, that proteſtants ſhould
vſe their helpe againſt the common aduerſary,
who moſt feareth them: As appeareth by that
which is already ſaid out of the Wardword: And
by that which <hi>Dolman</hi> (one, who throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17471:22"/>
the ſtate of things) affirmeth to wit, that pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritans
be a ſtrong party, for London &amp; good towns,
moſt Lords, gentlemen, &amp; Captaines (that be of the
religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) incline that way, and be men of action &amp;
reſolution. But to leaue the laity, Conſider the cler<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gy,
(whom ye are eſpecially to vſe againſt the pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>piſts)
&amp; (ſetting by <hi>nonreſidents</hi> &amp; dumb dogs)
ye ſhall finde tenne puritans for one formaliſt, and
that one puritan doth more advance the goſpell, &amp;
ſuppreſſe popery, than tenne formaliſts. For he at<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tends
his miniſtery, &amp; not multiplying or exchang<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
of benefices. he preacheth, not once a moneth,
or leſſe, but every ſaboth day, &amp; that, not to pleaſe
the eare, but to moue the hart. How can ye want
the miniſtery of ſuch men? but (bleſſed be God) I
heare, that of late, the mouthes of ſome long ſilenced
be in ſome ſorte opened, continue your favour to
wards them, and incourage others that be ſetled, if
ye deſire <hi>(bona fide)</hi> to prevent toleration, and the
multiplying of papiſts.</p>
               <p>Laſtly. I pray yee to marke and (in your godly

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:17471:23"/>
it is, that the Puritan ſhall overcome the
Proteſtant, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the contrary: For that the puri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tan
buildeth directly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the proteſtants firſt
grounds in religion, and deduceth thereof
clearely, and by ordinary conſequence, all his
concluſions: which the proteſtant cannot deny
by divinity, but only by policy, and humaine
ordination, or by turning to Catholique an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres,
contrary to their owne principles. And
theirefore it is hard for any man, ſincerely to
be a Proteſtant, but that he wil eaſily paſſe on
alſo (more or leſſe) to be a Puritan. And onely
they (in effect) wilbe againſt them, who are in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tereſted
