         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Dutch and the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
ſince the expiration of the
laſt truce, which ended with the
beginning of the yeare 1621. Thou maiſt behold alſo a
true counterpoiſe or comparatiue ballancing of the ſame,
wherein it doth moſt plainely appeare, that the Dutch
haue not onely not beene looſers in theſe latter and time
neerer warres of the Netherlands, but for diuers ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantageous
reſpects, haue beene victorious againſt their
potent and moſt redoubted Enemies, who vnder the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable

partiality and detraction: For my part I know the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour

vnwilling that any knowne truth, though it were in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

moſt remarkable loſſes by the Dutch, in theſe latter and
time-neerer Warres of the Netherlands. In the diluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
whereof I meane not to inſtance in the loſſe of
men, money, munition, and ſhipping, which like our
haire growe out againe vpon euery new reinforcement

ſolid and ſubſtantiall, as the loſſe of Townes, Cities,
Lands, and Territories, which like an arme or legge
cut off, ſildome or neuer growe out againe, to the vſe
and intereſt of their firſt poſſeſſors, eſpecially they being
ſeized by the Dutch or Spaniards, whoſe talents are of
a ſtrong retentiue power, and who know to keepe that,
which they haue once gotten and acquired, as well as
any Nations in Chriſtendome whatſoeuer: ſo that if

the latter, beyond the paralell and degrees of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon.
For the better light and manifeſtation whereof,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7775:6"/>
we muſt vnderſtand thus much, that thoſe parcels
which <hi>Philip</hi> the 4. now holdes in <hi>Cleeue</hi> and <hi>Iuliers,</hi> were
not plumes aunciently belonging to that new ſpread
Eagles backe of <hi>Spaine,</hi> but faſtned on like <hi>Icarus</hi> wings,

fleſh: for notwithſtanding diuers admonitions and
cautions to the contrary from ſome of their faſteſt
friends, who were iealous of their good, and ſtudious
of the common peace and tranquility of their domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
The Newenburger ſtrengthens himſelfe with Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſans

An experience which ſhall proue hurtfull both to the

the Spaniards hauing ſeized vpon <hi>Weezell, Rhinebercke,
Duiſſeldorpe,</hi> and other places of the Dutchie, keepe
them vpon pretence of their charges, and aſſurance of
their Frontier. The Dutch hauing ſurpriſed <hi>Rees, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricke,
Cleeue, Goffe,</hi> and <hi>Gulicke,</hi> man theſe Townes with
their owne Garriſons, vpon the conſideration of the
ſame and other pretences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gulicke</hi> was a thorne in <hi>Albertus</hi> foote, and an eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore
in the Caſtilians light. <hi>Vanderbercke</hi> muſt plucke
this out, being Generall of the Spaniſh Forces in their
Cleuian expedition, which began vnder his command
in the midſt of Auguſt 1622. That yeare being the next
after the expiration of the truce, the Enemies were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſtrong, as hauing three Armies in the field, one in
Flaunders beſieging <hi>Sluce,</hi> vnder the commaund of <hi>Inigo
de Borges,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> another houering
about <hi>Goffe</hi> and <hi>Zantom,</hi> commaunded by the Marquis
<hi>Spinola,</hi> which attended the motions of our Naſſauian
Armie, lying then as in our durtie Quarters of <hi>Dornicke,</hi>
and this third which beleguerd <hi>Gulicke,</hi> vnder the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of the Earle of <hi>Monts,</hi> commonly called <hi>Henry
Vanderberke.</hi> This Citie is the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the Dutchy
of <hi>Iuliers,</hi> vnto which it giues his name ſeated vpon the
Riuer of <hi>Roer,</hi> in a fruitful Cuntry, which ſtretcheth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
thence vnto the bankes of the Dent. It was well forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7775:7"/>
and defended, for beſides the olde fortifications
which were found at the firſt reducement of this place,
there were new Rauelins and halfe Moones made by
the directions of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
there lay fourteene Companies of foote, Engliſh,
Dutch and French within the walls, vnder their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour
Signieur <hi>Pethan,</hi> beſides <hi>Thomas Villers</hi> troupe
of Horſe, which was reputed to be one of the braueſt
in all the Netherlands. But although it were well man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and ſtrongly fortified, yet for want of victuals it
muſt yeeld to the power of the Conquerour: for the
prouiſion and ſtore of the Magazine growing tainted,
by Commiſſion from the States <hi>Pithan,</hi> makes ſale of it,
vnto thoſe Merchants that would giue moſt for it. <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola</hi>
vnderſtanding of this by the Nuntioes of his intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
before it could be re-victualed by the States,
ſends <hi>Henry Vander Barke</hi> to beſiege it with an Armie of
ſixteene thouſand men, both Horſe and Foote, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of diuers Nations, as Italians, Spaniards, French,
and Almaines. Vpon their firſt approches, and before
all the aduenues and paſſages were blockt vp, ſome of
the Captaines, amongſt whom Captaine <hi>Haydon,</hi> and
Captaine <hi>Aiſhley,</hi> were moſt forward, preſented their
ſeruice vnto the Gouernour, and offered him vpon his
leaue to victuall the Towne aboundantly from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſions
of the Country: the ſeaſon of the yeare ſeruing
fitly for it, it being as then about the beginning of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt,
The counſell was good and wholſome, and might
haue wrought the preſeruation of <hi>Gulick,</hi> if it had beene
apprehended and executed in time. But <hi>Pethan</hi> obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
himſelfe too ſtrictly to his Commiſſion, reiecteth
the proffer, pretending that hee durſt not doe it as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7775:8"/>
no Warrant for this Deſigne. In the meane time
Count <hi>Henricke</hi> well husbanding this occaſion, ſits
downe before the Towne, Intrencheth himſelfe ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and drawes his approches cloſe to our vtter Works,
for the better planting of his Cannon. Thus <hi>Pethan</hi>
ſees his errour, and too late ſeekes to redreſſe the ſame.
Then hee reſolues vppon a ſally which might haue
wrought ſome good effect, if it had beene ſooner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprized.
In this conflict our men ſurpriz'd and ſleigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
one of the Enemies Fortifications, charged them
home to their teeth, and hauing got ſome proportion
of ſpoiles and victuals, made their retreat good vnto
the Ports, with the loſſe only of Captaine <hi>Baſſenheime,</hi>
and ſixe and thirty of their Horſemen: amongſt the
reſt young Captaine <hi>Haydons</hi> valour was moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
he was Captaine of a Foote Company, yet vpon
that day he ſeru'd on Horſe-backe. One of the Enemies
aduauncing himſelfe before the groſſe of their troupes,
dares any of our ſide proudly to the Combat. <hi>Haydon</hi>
accepts it, and charging him with his Piſtoll, kill'd the
Challenger vpon the place, and after that being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd
by a ſecond, he falls backe to the body of our
Troupes in ſafety. The fortune of this skirmiſh did but
tye the ſquib to the Bulls tayle, encreaſing our appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
and their anger. Vpon this they batter our Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers
furiouſly with the Cannon, and ſalute the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
with often vollies of their Musket ſhot. Our men
anſwere them with Balls of the ſame mettall. Amongſt
the midſt of theſe Reuolets, paſſing with a doubtfull
ſucceſſe of fortune betweene the beſiegers and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged,
there chanced a caſuall fire to be kindled in the
Spaniſh Quarters. Our Fire-men plye this place with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7775:8"/>
their Shotte both great and ſmall, and worke ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
dammage vpon the Enemies. But theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploites
could not alay the biting ſmart of our hunger,
which now began to rage and raigne in euery Quarter:
For the Towne Prouiſions being ſpent, and the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zins
waſted, things vnuſuall, and vnaccuſtomed to the
palate, were deuoured; as Dogs, Cats and the like. This
inforcement cauſed <hi>Pethan</hi> to demaund a Parlee about
the midſt of Ianuarie: notwithſtanding his firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to <hi>Vander Berke,</hi> that he would not hearken to the
motion of that accord till Eaſter.</p>
            <p>For this purpoſe three Captaines were ſent out of
the Ports vnto their Campe, the one an Engliſh man,
the other two French &amp; Dutch. After ſome difficul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties,
the agreement was conſummated vpon theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
following.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the Spaniards ſhould not bring the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
into the Dutchie of <hi>Iuliers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> nor make any alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in matters of Religion.</p>
            <p>2. That the Captaines and Souldiers ſhould depart
vpon honourable termes, with their Armes fixt, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
flying, Drums beating, and their Wiues, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and Goods.</p>
            <p>3. That their Ordnance and Munition ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
in the Towne.</p>
            <p>4. That their Armourers, Smithes, and Gunners,
might haue liberty freely to depart with the Souldiers.</p>
            <p>5. That the Gouernour and Captaines might haue
Horſe and Waggons, with a ſufficient conuoy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
them to <hi>Nimeghen,</hi> and that their ſick &amp; wounded
might ſtay vntill they were recouered, and then to haue
Waggons to conduct them to the ſame place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:7775:9"/>
6. That the Captaines and Souldiers ſhould haue a
whole yeares liberty, to ſell their lands if they had any.</p>
            <p>7. That the Captaines and Souldiers which were in
any other place of the Dutchie, ſhould haue leaue to
come thither, and bring their Wiues and Children.</p>
            <p>8. That the Armes and Commodities belonging to
the Towne and Caſtle, ſhould be left behinde.</p>
            <p>9. That all Records and auncient Writings in the
Towne and Caſtle, ſhould remaine there ſtill.</p>
            <p>10. That the Souldiers ſhould not be arreſted for
debt.</p>
            <p>11. That the beds which the Souldiers had brought
into the Towne, ſhould be reſtored to their owners.</p>
            <p>12. That the Electour of <hi>Brandeburghs</hi> Officers and
Miniſters ſhould execute their Offices for the ſpace of
one whole yeare then next enſuing.</p>
            <p>13. That the Citizens might depart the Citie, and
diſpoſe of their goods within one yeare.</p>
            <p>14. That there ſhould be two Hoſtages giuen on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, vntill the Articles were performed, all which
being ſigned and ſealed by the Gouernour, hee ſhould
ſend a Copie of it to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and be bound
to yeeld the place, if they were not releeued within 12.
dayes, with 300. Waggons at the leaſt: which time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
expired, and no reliefe comming from <hi>Dornicke</hi> or
elſe-where. <hi>Vanderberke</hi> ſent 600. Waggons to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
their baggage, wiſhing the Gouernour to haſten
his departure: who ſending the keyes vnto the Earle,
departed with all his Goods and Souldiers, leauing
two Hoſtages behinde, vntill the Waggons were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pethan</hi> vpon his comming to the <hi>Hague,</hi> was arreſted
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7775:9"/>
by order from the States, and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was
confined as priſoner to his owne houſe, hauing a Guard
of Muskettiers ſet ouer him, and his dignities which he
enioyed in that Common-wealth, were ſuſpended for
a time, vntill he ſhould cleare himſelfe, and giue a iuſt
account of his actions.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the loſſe of <hi>Gulicke</hi> conquered ſome
fifteene yeares before, by the valour of the States for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
ioyntly with the ſuccours of foure thouſand Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
vnder the commaund of that noble and well expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
commander Generall <hi>Cecill;</hi> and now re-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
by the Spaniards, more by the power of hunger,
then the powerfulnes of their Armes: which loſſe came
not ſolitarie and alone, but was aggrauated with the
ſociety of another, though of leſſe conſequence and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance:
and this was the ſurpriſe of <hi>Lulſtorff, Blanken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge,</hi>
and <hi>Monawe,</hi> ſmall Garriſons held by <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge,</hi>
in the Dutchie of <hi>Iuliers,</hi> and the taking of <hi>Goffe,</hi>
a little Towne in Cleaueland, ſeated vpon the South
ſide of the Rhine, almoſt oppoſite vnto <hi>Rees,</hi> which
makes the ſecond loſſe of Townes or Territories, ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the States, in theſe laſt Warres of the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands.</p>
            <p>This place was of no great importance, onely it
made the Weſterne parts of <hi>Cleeue,</hi> pay ſome ſmall
Contribution to the Electour of <hi>Brandenburge.</hi> It was
meanely fortified, and but weakely manned; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vpon the Spinolians firſt approches &amp; ſummons,
it yeelded to the ſtronger, the Souldiers of the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
departing vpon conditions of honor. Afterwards
by directions from their Counſell of Warre, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7775:10"/>
it with a Rampier, Counterſcarfe, and ſome other
outer Works, ſo that it is now become a peece of ſome
reaſonable defence.</p>
            <p>His Excellencie the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> carying <hi>Argus</hi>
eyes vppon all your Spaniſh proiects; before their
Workes were well ſetled, marcht thither in the latter
end of Summer 1623. intending to take the Towne by
an Onſlate. In his Armie there were my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi>
my Lord <hi>Wriotheſlie,</hi> ſonne to the Earle of <hi>Southampton,</hi>
with diuers other noble Voluntiers from <hi>England,
Fraunce,</hi> and elſe-where. But he dealt with an Enemie,
whoſe eyes were as good as his hands: for they hauing
notice of his comming, fore-layd the paſſage, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued
preuention to the vtmoſt. The Prince viewing
their Forces thus facing of our Armie, and lodged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
in a place of aduantage: after a long <hi>Alto,</hi> wherein
he braued the foes, retired his Troupes from the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
of <hi>Goffe,</hi> which ſtill groanes vnder the yoake of
the Caſtilian gouernement and oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>The third loſſe which the States of the vnited Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces
haue receiued, and that ſince the taking of <hi>Gulick</hi>
and <hi>Goffe,</hi> hath beene the ſurpriſall of <hi>Papenmuch,</hi> a ſtrong
Sconce, built by the Confederates in a certaine Iland
of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> betweene <hi>Coleine</hi> and <hi>Bonne,</hi> an Imperiall
Towne, heretofore ſurprized by Sir <hi>Martin Skencke,</hi> in
the yeare 1587. The Spaniards knew what a bridle
<hi>Skenks Sconce</hi> (a Fort built vpon that nooke of Land)
where the <hi>Rhine</hi> deuideth it ſelfe into two branches,
making the <hi>Peniuſula</hi> of <hi>Grauen worke,</hi> had been to their
projected deſignes vpon <hi>Cleeue, Geldres,</hi> and <hi>Friſeland,</hi>
they could not ſuffer a ſnaffle of the ſame mettall, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7775:10"/>
making, in the mouth of the Biſhop of <hi>Colein,</hi> a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and wholly deuoted to the houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria.</hi>
Beſides, the poſſeſſing of it did concerne them
much, for the tranſportation of their Forces from or
into the lower circles of the Empire, and for victualing
of <hi>Rhineberke, Weezell,</hi> and other places, by the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of the Riuer. Theſe motiues incited <hi>Spinola</hi> to ſend
thither an Armie of ſufficient ſtrength and number, for
the conqueſt of this important Citadell. Theſe troupes
were commaunded by the Prince of <hi>Chimay,</hi> and one
<hi>Bree,</hi> Lieutenant Generall vnto the Prince of <hi>Newen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge.</hi>
They raiſed ſmall Forts, commonly called Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douts
vpon euery paſſage, drew their approches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a conuenient diſtance, and brought ſome Peeces
of the greater ſize from <hi>Iuliers</hi> for the battery: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
they built two ſmall Ships of Warre, not draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much water vpon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to this intent that all
the land paſſages being ſtopt, &amp; the aduenues by water
being alſo ſhut vp, time and hunger (two powerfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,
much made vſe of by the Fabian Generals
of <hi>Spaine)</hi> might worke the conqueſt and deliuerance of
this place. The euent anſwered their expectation: for
the Defendants being preſt with this vnreſiſtable diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
ſurrendred vp the Sconce about the latter end
of the yeare 1622. vpon condition to depart with bagge
and baggage.</p>
            <p>And thus you ſee a full ſuruay of thoſe greater and
more ſubſtantiall loſſes, which the States haue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
ſince the expiration of the laſt twelue yeares
truce, from their ancient and ſworne Enemies of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
The relation of their victories followes, ſuparlatiue to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7775:11"/>
their dammages, both for the reſpect of honour, and
the waight of their importance: and theſe may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
vnto two heads, vnto their victories acquired at
<hi>Riſhame</hi> and <hi>Ormus,</hi> Ilands ſeated vpon the coaſt of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi>
and aunciently belonging to that Kingdome, or to
their Conqueſts in <hi>Braſilia</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> Prouinces of the
new world, diſcouered by <hi>Americus,</hi> from whence it
tooke his name, for the vſe of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi>
their children, heires, and ſucceſſours. For although
in the Conqueſt of the fore-ſaid Ilands, the Dutch as
well as our Engliſh, were but auxiliaries vnto the Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
yet becauſe they were <hi>pars magna laboris,</hi> they had I
ſay a great ſhare in the labour and danger of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit,
by way of reducement, and not improperly, it
may bee fylde amongſt the number of their atchiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
This <hi>Riſhame</hi> or <hi>Rhiſme</hi> is a ſmall Iland, diſtant
from <hi>Ormus</hi> ſome foure leagues, and ſeparated from
thence by a ſmall fret of the Sea, commonly called the
ſound of <hi>Balſora.</hi> The Portingals had built a ſtrong
Caſtle in it, manned with three hundred Chriſtians,
and fiue hundred Negroes, commanded by <hi>Rufero</hi> their
Gouernour. Our Fleete vpon the 24. of Ianuarie 162<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, came within ſhot of the Caſtle, and plied the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
with diuers peales of Ordinance, and by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of our ſhipping and Cannon, gaue meanes to the
Perſian, to land ten thouſand of his Souldiers. Theſe
Mahometan Troupes were commaunded by one of
their Sultans, for ſo they call their Lords, a man of
great valour and conduct, as the ſequele ſhall make
good. Vpon their firſt landing they play the Terriers,
put themſelues into the earth, &amp; bring their approches
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7775:11"/>
within a neere diſtance. <hi>Rufero</hi> terrified with this ſtrait
aſſignement, as being inuironed both by land and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and hauing no Element to helpe him, but the all-common
Ayre, and the fire of his Cannon, demaunds
a parlee: to hinder farther effuſion of blood it was
graunted. But the conditions propoſed were diſlikt by
the Aſſailants: for the Portugall wholy ayming at the
preſeruation of <hi>Ormus,</hi> and ſleighting that of <hi>Rhiſme,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he ſaw no poſſibility to keepe it, offers preſently
to ſurrender the Caſtle, vpon condition that his men,
both Spaniards and Blacks, might haue free liberty to
paſſe ouer vnto <hi>Ormus.</hi> Any man that had but <hi>Poliphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
eye, might ſee through the miſt of this pretence.
Our Captaines, <hi>Blight, Weddall,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Monnox,</hi> men
much honoured for this ſeruice, were apprehenſiue
enough to conceiue the aduantage of this propoſition.
Therefore they reiect it, and fall to their battery againe,
ſo that waighing neerer to the Caſtle, they beſtowe
ſeauen or eight hundred great Shot vpon the Curtin
and Bulwarkes. The Perſians likewiſe from the land
ſide, draw their rowling trenches within a ſtones caſt,
and ply the Caſtellans with vnceſſant vollies of their
ſmall Shot, who anſwered them with the like, and flung
diuers Pots of Wilde-fire and Granadoes into their
Workes, which did them much hurt. The terrour of
this cauſed a ſecond parlee; wherein <hi>Rufero</hi> offers to
ſurrender the place vpon theſe cautions following, that
he might depart to <hi>Ormus</hi> with his Armes and Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and race the walls of the Caſtle downe to the
ground. This ſecond motion being reiected like as the
former, we ſaluted them afreſh with the thunder of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7775:12"/>
ſame curteſie. But the Defendants ſeeing themſelues
thus diſtreſſed on all ſides, yeeld at the laſt vppon
theſe conditions.</p>
            <p>That they ſhould depart with bagge and baggage,
and all other things that they had, their Armes, Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Ordnance expected, and that the Souldiers,
as well Blackes as others, ſhould be tranſported vnto
Muskat, a Towne which the Portingals hold vpon the
Arabian ſhore, onely ſome of the Principals were to be
detayned aboord our Shippes, and to be diſpoſed of as
occaſion ſhould require; ſo the Caſtle of <hi>Rhiſme</hi> was
ſurrendred vnto the Perſians the 30. of Ianuarie 1621.
and all the Articles were performed on both ſides, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
that the Sultan cauſed ſome foureſcore of the
captiue Negroes to be murdered, contrary to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and faith of his promiſe.</p>

was made tributary to the Portugals <hi>anno</hi> 1606. who
taking aduantage of the Perſian troubles, and their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of maritine affaires, fortified themſelues ſtrongly
in this place, which they kept to their great profit and
honour aboue foureſcore yeares, vntill after the death
of <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> and the Conqueſt of <hi>Portugall,</hi> it was vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

landed 3000. of their men, who marched ſtraight vnto
the Towne, which being a place of no great defence,
they tooke it, without any reſiſtance at all; The Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals
&amp; the Moores retiring themſelues into the Caſtle
with their goods and treaſure. Vpon this the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Fleete plies the Forte, and the Enemies Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats
which lay vnder the Lee thereof with their Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance:
and the Mahometans Land their whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
plant their Batteries, and mount their Cannon,
which they had borrowed from the Chriſtians. And
that they might with more expedition and facility,
make themſelues Maiſters of this peece: they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vndermined
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7775:13"/>
the wall at leaſt tenne foote right in,
and placed fortie Barrels of Powder in the Mine,
which being ſprung vpon Sunday, the 17. of the
ſame moneth, made a breach of ſome twentye
foote broad at leaſt. Preſently vpon this, th' Aſſailants
preſent themſelues brauely to the breach, and ſeeking
to gaine their paſſage to the top of the ruines, are as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
repuls'd by the Defendants: Who ſalute
them with Stones, Powderpots, Tarlin, and Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot;
and make good the breach from noone to night,
againſt all commers; notwithſtanding the furie of the
Artillery, and the continuall vollies of Musket bullets,
which fell in as thicke as haile amongſt them. The Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals
loſt two Cullers diſplaid one after another, with
ſome of their forwardeſt men, &amp; their Battlements and
Barricadoes made of Cotton ſackes, were much torne
and defaced with the furie of our Ordinance. The
Perſians loſt not fortie men out-right, but ſome three
hundred or more were wounded and burnt, part of
whom afterwards periſhed. The 20. day in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
there came out of the Caſtle two aged men with
a youth, and three or foure Negroes attending them,
who were preſently conueyed by Sea (to the intent
that they might not view our workes) to the houſe of
<hi>Dabul,</hi> whereas the <hi>Sultan</hi> attended by diuers <hi>Cuſhel
Baſsaes,</hi> and his Guard of Arabians, went to meete, and
treat with theſe Portugals. But this taking no effect,
they deſired leaue of him to goe ouer to <hi>Combreane</hi> to
the <hi>Sophie,</hi> which was granted them. But when they
came ouer, he would condiſcend to nothing without
the conſent of the Chriſtians. The Spaniſh Delegates
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7775:13"/>
being thus diſmiſt, the Perſians ſinke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in their
Mines againe, and after they had made the vault capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
enough, they lodged 55. Barrels of powder in it,
and ram'd vp the hole which gaue entrance to this
Mine, with Timber, Stones, and Morter. It tooke
fire about ſixe of the clocke earely in the morning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the 2. of Aprill, and blew vp moſt of the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne
Bulworke, with ſuch violence and impetuoſitie,
that the ſtones of this worke were blowne at leaſt ſixe
hundred paces from the place.</p>
            <p>This mine was ſprung contrary to the intentions of
the Dutch and Engliſh in the time of the parlee, and
that by the directions of the Perſian Generall, who
was blemiſht with treacherie for doing of this acte.
For at that time there were many Portugals walking
vpon the wall where the blow was giuen; foure or fiue
of whom were blown vp and ſlaine.</p>
            <p>The 14. of Aprill the Perſians blew vp the 3. Mine,
vpon the eaſt ſide of the Caſtle, yet would they not as
yet enter, becauſe they were working of another on
the weſt ſide, which they ſprung the 17. of the ſame
month. The Mahometan ſouldiers vpon this entered,
and poſſeſt themſelues of the weſterne Bulworke, and
ſeeking to force the Portugals Barricadoes, were by
them repulſt with great ſlaughter. The Perſian <hi>Sultan</hi>
ſeing his men retire, comes to the foote of the breach,
and with his ſword in his hand ready drawne, makes
them renue the aſſault againe: In which conflict, the
valour of one Portugall was moſt remarkable, who
with his Sword and Buckler, fought vpon the point of
the breach, and forceably repulſt the aſſailants. But
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7775:14"/>
marke how Fortune proues a Step-dame to his valour:
He charging freely vpon one of them with his Rapier,
thruſt it into one of their wooden Bucklers and before
he could free the point, hee was charged by three or
foure of the Perſians, and cut in pieces by them. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
two or three dayes after this aſſault, the <hi>Sophie</hi> paſſed
ouet from <hi>Combreane</hi> vnto the Iland of <hi>Ormus,</hi> where
he ſhewed that magnificence &amp; munificence (befitting
one of <hi>Iſmaels</hi> ſucceſſors) vnto the ſouldiers and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of the Army.</p>
            <p>The beſiegded ſeeing no hope of ſuccours, and that
themſelues were diſabled in their defences, by Mines,
Batteries, and Aſſaults, yeelded the Caſtle vpon theſe
conditions.</p>
            <p>1 That they might depart with bagge and baggage,
without any armes, ſauing their Swords and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers.</p>
            <p>2 That the ſicke and wounded ſhould be left in the
Towne, and lookt vnto by Chirurgions.</p>
            <p>3 That aſwell theſe as thoſe that were ſound, ſhould
be conueyed vnto <hi>Muskat,</hi> a Mountain town of <hi>Arabia,</hi>
by the <hi>Robert</hi> and <hi>Sherling,</hi> two Engliſh ſhips. Thus this
Caſtle and Iland the 24. of Aprill were yeelded to the
Sophie by the auxiliary meanes of the Dutch and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,
after it had bene poſſeſt by the Portugals and
Spaniards an hundred and eighty yeares.</p>
            <p>The ſecond loſſe which the Spaniards haue ſuffered
ſince theſe laſt warres of the Netherlands, hath beene
the taking of the towne and part of <hi>Todos los Sanctos,</hi>
in <hi>Braſilia.</hi> This Countrey is limited on the South
with <hi>Riedo la Plate</hi> and <hi>Chile,</hi> on the North with <hi>Guiana,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:7775:14"/>
on the Eaſt with the Ocean, and on the Weſt with the
Mountaines of <hi>Peru,</hi> called the <hi>Audes,</hi> which deuideth
the Countrey of <hi>Ieru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

as <hi>Taurus</hi> and <hi>Caucaſus</hi> doe <hi>Aſia.</hi> The people which
inhabit theſe ſteepe and craggie Mountaines, are more
barbarous then other Americans, as being taunie all
ouer their bodies, going altogether naked, and liuing
without houſes or bedding: Thoſe of the vally are
more temperate and ciuill, as partaking the qualities
and temperature of the Climate: The Earth of the
vallies, is fatte, greene, and alwayes flouriſhing; aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with Sugar, Mace, and your Braſilian Wood, vſed
in Europe for your dying of reddes; the Trees wherof
are of exceeding bigneſſe, wherein Nature proues the
Architect, for diuerſe large families which dwell in
the bodies and branches of them. This land was firſt
diſcoueted by <hi>Pedro Aluari Caprioli,</hi> at the expences of
<hi>Emanuel</hi> King of <hi>Portugal, Anno</hi> 1500. afterwards it was
more exactly ſuruayed by <hi>Americus Veſpucius,</hi> next by
<hi>Giouanni de Empoli</hi> a Florentine, <hi>Anno</hi> 1503. Afterwards
by <hi>Iohn Stadius</hi> a Dutch-man, <hi>Anno.</hi> 1554. And by the
Edict of that Monſter of Man-kinde (Pope <hi>Alexander</hi>
the ſixt) it was appropriated to the Portugals; the reſt
of America being allotted to the Caſtilians.</p>
            <p>The chiefeſt Citties of this Prouince are,</p>
            <p>1 Fernambuco.</p>
            <p>2 Aſcenſio.</p>
            <p>3 <hi>Todos los Sanstos,</hi> otherwiſe called St. <hi>Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.</hi>
This towne ſtands vpon a Bay of the ſame name,
vnto which the Riuer of <hi>Reall</hi> diſchargeth it ſelfe, and
hath <hi>Fernambuco</hi> an hundred miles to the northward,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7775:15"/>
and it lyes from the Equinoctiall fifteen degrees to the
ſouthward. It was reaſonable ſtrong, and thought by
the Portugals (who are generally ouer-weening in their
owne conceits, both of themſelues and their owne
ſtrength) to be tenable againſt any forces whatſoeuer.
The journey being reſolued on by the Weſt Indian
Company of the Netherlands, they put to Sea the 22.
of December 1623. from <hi>Texell</hi> a Port of <hi>Holland,</hi> with
a Fleete of thirtie ſhips, well furniſhed with Armes,
Lead, Powder, Ordinance, and other warlike muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Iacob Willeks,</hi> a man of good experience in Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
matters, commanded for the ſea, and the Lord
of <hi>Dorte</hi> commanded all the Land-forces. The Lord
Generall hauing ouer-ſayled the Admirall, had beene
before the towne three dayes before, being the 6. of
May 1624. and hauing exchanged ſome ſhot with the
Caſtle, went to ſea againe, as reſolued to ſeeke out their
Admirall <hi>Willekes,</hi> and the reſt of the company. This
attempt gaue an alarum to the Spaniards, who conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturing
as the truth was, that more numbers followed
theſe, &amp; that for ſome deſigne vpon this p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ce, prepared
themſelues for their defence, with all preuention and
prouiſion poſſible.</p>
            <p>They mounted eight pieces of Ordinance vpon a
Battery of Free-ſtone, the Slaues of the towne (aſwell
Chriſtians as others) were commaunded to the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier,
and raiſed two new batteries by the direction of
the Vize-roy, who was alſo very carefull to ſee the men
muſtered and ezerciſed in their armes according to the
manner of the Caſtilian Diſcipline, the number of
whom amounted to ſome 5500. men, whereof the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7775:15"/>
made 4000. and the ſouldiers 1500. They of the
Land battered our ſhippes furiouſly from the Caſtles,
and vpon one of the three was the Vize-roy himſelfe,
with his ſonne, and the greateſt part of the Gentry.</p>
            <p>Our Admirall in the meane time ſayled vp &amp; downe
in the Bay, reſoluing how hee might land his Troups
with beſt aduantage; for this reſpect, he imbarks 1600.
of his beſt and choiceſt men in foure of the talleſt
ſhippes, and commanding the reſt to follow ſlowely,
he enters the Bay the 9. of May 1624. Comming neare
the Enemies Batteries, he cauſed all their Ordinance to
be diſcharged on their Caſtles and Platformes, and
landing ſome hundred men with their loug-boats, they
took the Batteries preſently: the Marriners doing very
good ſeruice in this aſſault with their Boate-hookes.
Vpon this the Defendants hang out a flagge of truce,
and moſt of them quit the foreſaid places. But the
Vize-roy, perſiſts reſolute in defence of that Breach,
whereupon himſelfe was ingag'd, and though hardly
preſt by the Dutch, he fights it out to the vtmoſt with
ſome of the braueſt Caualeroes of the town. But when
he ſaw at the laſt, himſelfe forſaken of all ſides, he fled
towards his own Pallace: but in the way our Marriners
&amp; ſoldiers ceazed vpon his perſon; who putting his
ſword into his ſheath, deliuered theſe words vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
I haue beene faitbfull vnto my King, and if my men had
not ſo baſely forſaken me, your forces ſhould not haue
taken the Caſtle ſo ſoone. Vpon the ſurrender of the
Caſtle, all the leſſer Forts yeelded themſelues, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
the fortune of the Canqueror; the which
was the more happy in this reſpect, becauſe it was
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7775:16"/>
accompliſhed with little effuſion of Chriſtian blood,
there being not ſlaine aboue forty common Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and one Captaine.</p>
            <p>The tenth day of May, the Netherlanders went to
ſurpriſe the Towne, but when they approached neere
the Ports, they perceiued that it was abandoned by the
Inhabitants, ſo that our Souldiers entred without any
reſiſtance. The pillage was great in Coyne, Plate, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels,
and other rich moueables, which the Souldiers
tooke out of the Houſes, Store-houſes, and Cellars.
Moreouer, there were taken 12000. Cheſts of Sugar,
thirty Ships laden with rich Marchandize, which lay in
the harbour, and eight ſhippes more of the Spaniards,
which arriued there ſince, not hauing notice of the
Dutchmens fortunes and proceedings.</p>
            <p>The third maine loſſe which the Spaniards haue ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained
ſince the expiration of the laſt truce, hath beene
at <hi>Lima,</hi> a famous Emporian and hauen Towne in <hi>Peru.</hi>
This Prouince was firſt diſcouered by <hi>Franciſco Piſarro,</hi>
afterwards Marquis of <hi>Antillo,</hi> and <hi>Diego de Almagro,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
honoured with the title of chiefe diſcouerer
by the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift; to whoſe vſe it was
firſt conquered by theſe aduentrous Spaniards from
<hi>Atapalipa</hi> and his brethren, right pretenders and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritours
of the ſame. It hath on the Eaſt the Perunian
mountaines, on the Weſt <hi>Ma re Pacificum,</hi> or <hi>del Sur,</hi>
on the North <hi>Caſtilia Aurea,</hi> and the Riuer of <hi>Peru,</hi> from
whence the Country taketh his name, and on the South
it hath <hi>Chila</hi> for his borders. The length of it is from
the Citie of <hi>Paſto,</hi> vnto the Prouince of <hi>Chili,</hi> one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
eight hundred leagues, as large as the leagues of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7775:16"/>
               <hi>Caſtilia.</hi> This Land is the ſeate of many wonders:
thence groweth that odoriferous wood, whoſe barke
being incided, diſtils a meruailous ſweet liquor, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
if any annoint a dead body, the carkaſſe corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
not.</p>
            <p>Neere to a cape or point of land, commonly called
<hi>Deſtahelena,</hi> there are found certaine Springs of Pitch or
Tarre, ſeruiceable for the calking &amp; trimming of Ships.
Here are Riuers which runne all day, but ſtand ſtill at
night, the reaſon whereof is, becauſe their current is
maintained by the ſnowe, which melts a day time, but
freezeth againe at night. It rayneth in the mountaines,
but neuer in the Plaines of <hi>Peru,</hi> the aſſigned reaſon
whereof is, that in the Plaines, and neere the Sea coaſt,
there bloweth all the yeare long one only winde which
the Mariners call <hi>Siluester,</hi> which runneth along with
ſuch forcible violence, that the cloudes and vapours
can haue no reſt in the middle Region ouer the plaine
Country. Beſides other ſmall townes which the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
haue in the Plaines, they haue fiue principle Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
The firſt is called <hi>Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>to Veio,</hi> which ſtandeth very
neere the equinoctiall: this Citie is poore, and apt for
diſeaſes, yet hath it ſome Mines of Gold &amp; Emeraulds.
Fifteene leagues within the Maine is another Citie
called <hi>St. Michael,</hi> which in the Indian ſpeech they call
<hi>Pura.</hi> This is a pleaſant ſoile and fruitfull, but there are
no Mines of Golde nor Plate. Threeſcore leagues for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
alongſt the coaſt ſtandeth another Citie in a val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
called <hi>Trugillio,</hi> being diſtant from the Sea two
leagues. This Citie is placed in a plaine plot neere to
the Reuers ſide, and is abundantly prouided of Wheat,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7775:17"/>
Maiz, and Cattell. It is alſo exceeding well built, and
in it there are three hundred houſholds of Spaniards.</p>
            <p>The fourth chiefe Citie is, that of <hi>Aroquipa,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called the faire. The ſoile neere vnto it is health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and aboundant of all kinde of victuals, ſtanding
ſome 12. leagues from the Sea coaſt, vpon a Riuer that
is faire and Nauigable, ſo that Ships of good burthen
may come vp to the walls of the Citie, by which means
it is thought the habitation of this towne will encreaſe.
It doth not onely ſupply her owne neceſſities, but ſerues
the Citie of <hi>Cuſco,</hi> and the Prouince of <hi>Carchas,</hi> with all
things needfull; from which places there is great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort
vnto <hi>Aroquipa,</hi> by reaſon of the frequent contracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
here, t for the golden mettall of <hi>Potoſi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fifth principall Citie exceeding all the reſt in
beauty, ſtrength, and riches, is that of <hi>Luma</hi> ſcituated
in a valley of the ſame name, ſome foureſcore leagues
from <hi>Trugillio.</hi> The Country there-about is plentifull
of Corne, and many ſorts of fruits and cattell: the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of this place is ſuch, that all the ſtreetes doe meete
in a faire large place, from the which a man may ſee
through euery ſtreete into the fields. The dwelling is
meruailous healthfull, becauſe it ſtandeth in a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
climate, not afflicted too much with extremities
of heate and colde: the hotteſt ſeaſon of the yeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more temperate then that of <hi>Spaine.</hi> For in the time
of their Summer heate, there falleth euery day in the
morning a ſweete and cooling dewe, which is not
hurtfull, but rather profitable for the health of man.
For it being vſed by way of Lotion, it is good for the
head aches and other diſeaſes. All Spaniſh fruit grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7775:17"/>
and proſpereth well in this ſoile, eſpecially Oren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Lemonds, Figges, Pomgranates, and Vines, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
there had beene great abundance, if the frequent
broyles and tumults betweene the Spaniſh Souldiers
had not hindred the labour and Plantation of the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen.</p>
            <p>This Citie is iudged to be the moſt pleaſant dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of all the Land, in reſpect of the commodity of the
harbour, the great contractation of Marchants, and the
generall reſort of the people of the maine Land, who
come thither from all parts, and buy their furniture
and prouiſion. From the Mines of this Prouince, is
brought great ſtore of gold and ſiluer. The ſcituation
of it is neere the midſt of the Land as yet diſcouered,
for which cauſe the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, placed
there a Chauncerie royall, and Iudges to decide his
ſubiects cauſes, which alſo doth encreaſe the conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the people. It is ſeated two leagues from the
Roade, commonly called <hi>Callee de Lima,</hi> or the Port of
<hi>Lima. Le Hermite</hi> Generall of a Fleete vnder the States
of the vnited Prouinces, knowing how much the gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this place might accommodate the Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and incommodate the Spaniards, reſolues vpon
the attempt. And being furniſhed with a ſufficient
number of ſhipping, and men befitting ſuch an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe,
he ſets ſaile from the Netherlands, and after a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Nauigation through the Straights of <hi>Magellan,</hi>
arriues at laſt in the South Sea oppoſite vnto <hi>Lima;</hi>
where hee makes his intention knowne to the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
and then aduentures vpon the exploit: wherein
Fortune ſhewed her ſelfe ſo fauourable, that with little
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7775:18"/>
or no loſſe, he made himſelfe Maſter of the <hi>Callee de Lime,</hi>
to the great terrour of the Citie, which as ſome men
report, hath ſince yeelded it ſelfe to the mercy of the
Hollanders. The Conquerours got a great ſpoile in
Shipping, Treaſure, and other rich commodities, and
haue ſince gotten two other places in the Prouince of
<hi>Peruana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you haue ſeene a true Suruay of thoſe moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
loſſes and victories, which haue hapned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the Hollanders and the Spaniards ſince the laſt
truce, which ended with the beginning of the yeare
1621. It followes, that after their expreſſion we ſhould
iuſtly counterpoiſe, and ballance them: which if wee
doe without nationall reſpect or partiall inclination,
wee ſhall ſee the Dutch Acquiſitions to exceede the
Spaniſh, and yet their loſſes to be farre inferiour vnto
the others. For leauing out <hi>Ormus</hi> out of the ballance,
becauſe it is now peculiariz'd vnto the Perſian, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it were won by the ſuccours of the Dutch and
Engliſh: if wee counterpoize the Conqueſt of Saint
<hi>Saluador,</hi> and the part of <hi>Lima</hi> (omitting that of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as doubtfull) with al the new Acquiſitions of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
we ſhall behold theſe to ouerway all thoſe, which this
Nation hath of late acquired in <hi>Cleeue</hi> and <hi>Iuliers;</hi> and
this aduantage doth proceede not from one, but from
diuers conditions and reſpects. For firſt of all, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of <hi>Gulicke,</hi> &amp; of the Dutchie, with their extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
Fees and Contributions, will not amount to aboue
an hundred thouſand Duckats yearely, and allowing
two thouſand Souldiers for the Garriſon of that Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neurie,
and euery man to haue fiue Shillings a weeke for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7775:18"/>
his pay, the annuall reuenue will hardly quit the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
wheras rating the reuenues of <hi>Braſilia</hi> at three mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of Duckats, and allowing one third of this accru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to riſe from <hi>Fernambuco,</hi> &amp; another from <hi>Aſcenſio,
Todos los Sanctos,</hi> with the territorie thereto adioyning,
ſhall by this account bring a million yearely to the
Cantors of the Netherlands.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Papenmuch</hi> with the tolage of the <hi>Rhine</hi> and; <hi>Goffe,</hi>
with the contribution money drawne from the Boores
of Weſt Cleaueland, did hardly pay their owne Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
but the keeping of the Port of <hi>Lima,</hi> may draw
(perhaps) a plentifull Contribution from the golden
Mines of <hi>Chili</hi> and <hi>Potoſi,</hi> beſides thoſe ſpoiles that <hi>Le
Hermite</hi> hath already gotten eſteemed to bee an ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
Maſſe, and worth many Tuns of gold.</p>
            <p>3. The Catholicke King payes foureſcore thouſand
Duckats vnto the Prince of <hi>Newenburge</hi> by Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for the reſignation of theſe two Dutchies, but the
States holde thoſe new Acquiſitions in <hi>America,</hi> by the
tenure of their Sword, and by that <hi>ius acquiſitum,</hi> which
power and fortune haue giuen to the ſtronger.</p>
            <p>4. The Spaniſh King hath other competitours in
<hi>Cleaue</hi> &amp; <hi>Iuliers,</hi> beſides the Confederates of the ſeauen
Prouinces, as the houſe of <hi>Brandeburge,</hi> and (perhaps)
the poſterity of the <hi>Newenburger,</hi> may rowſe themſelues
out of that Lethargie, wherein the Spaniſh Piſtolets
haue put their ſenceleſſe Father, and lay clayme to that
Inheritance, which doth belong to them, or the Brande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burger

yeares together.</p>
            <p>5. The loſſe of <hi>Gulicke, Goffe,</hi> and <hi>Papenmuch,</hi> giues

Embricke,</hi> and <hi>Skenkes Sconce,</hi> betweene that and their

in the Weſt Indies, the one vpon the North, the other
vpon the South Sea, doe euen waſt in the intermediate
Continent of <hi>America,</hi> and giue an entrance vnto thoſe
Prouinces, whoſe golde hath battered the walls, and
opened the gates of the ſtrongeſt Townes of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
for the Spaniards.</p>
            <p>6. And laſtly, the Inhabitants of <hi>Cleaue</hi> and <hi>Iuliers,</hi>
doe not well like the hard and heauy hand of your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilian
gouernment, no more then doe all the lower
circles of the Empire, as well knowing how theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders
haue impaired the Germane liberty, and ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall'd
<hi>Bohemia</hi> and the <hi>Palatinate</hi> almoſt to death: but
the <hi>Braſilians</hi> and <hi>Peruuians,</hi> yea the very Portugals
themſelues would willingly receiue the law from the
Dutch-men, whom they admire as much for their faire
and gentle gouernement, as they hate the others for
their rigour, tiranny, and oppreſſion.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Onourable Profeſſors of Armes,
you may ſee in this Dutch Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uay
or ballance, the ſwelling
fortune of a triumphant State:
You may beholde alſo a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of Netherlanders, with ſome

giue the checke to that
Kingdome, which ſo long hath ſtroue for the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,
Supreame Paramount of all Chriſtendome: Let
this Preſident ſerue for our preſent encouragement;
and withall, let vs conſider, that if thoſe 7. Prouinces
(thought to be but a morſell for the Spaniards mouth,
they being not as bigge as that part of <hi>England</hi> whch
lyes Northward beyond the <hi>Trent)</hi> could make their
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7775:20"/>
partie good for ſo many yeares together, againſt the
Catholique King, and his Pack-horſe the Catholique
Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> What ſhall not the vnited forces
of England, France, Denmarke, and the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
doe againſt Pope, or Emperour, Auſtrian or
Bauarian, or any other Chriſtian Potentate what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer;
The expected bleſſings of God, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
ſupplies of meanes, and the vndoubted Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of a good cauſe concurring therewithall? In the
proſecution whereof, let not the Papall curſes and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
the vncharitable cenſures of your Ieſuitized
Engliſh, nor the fooliſh preſages of the <hi>Speedewels</hi> ill
ſpeed, any thing deterre vs: For that Royall Ship which
ſhould haue tranſported ouer the Count, was caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
by the default of the Pilot, a man not well aquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with thoſe Seas, a ſtranger vnto Fluſhing, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
(as it is thought) with a malicious reſolution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the perſon of Count <hi>Mansfield.</hi> So that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
any coniecture vpon this euent, befitting aſwell
a Colledge of Romane Augurs, as it doth a Conclaue
of <hi>Ignatius</hi> Diſciples, let vs diſcend nearer to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and accommodate our ſelues to the expreſſion of
theſe Motiues, which may confirme the ſtronger, and
ſtrengthen the more doubtfull and weaker ſpirits (if
there be any ſuch) who are vndertakers in this new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
Mansfeldian Expedition. And firſt, concerning
thoſe Motiues, your worthineſſe may vnderſtand that
they may fitly be reduced vnto the number of three.</p>
            <p>The firſt whereof, is the ſufficiency and conduct of
that Generall vnder whom you are to vndertake.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is the meanes of prouiſion and prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7775:20"/>
made for the vndertakers.</p>
            <p>The third motiue, is the cauſe conceaued, though
not expreſſed, for which you are to vndertake and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe
this action. And firſt, concerning the Generall,
you are to fight vnder one whom neuer aduerſity could
deiect, nor euer proſperity could once erect beyond the
temper of true command. You are to fight vnder ſuch
a Commander, whom Piſtolets, promiſes, nor proſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
(the powerfull Inſtruments to ſubiect ſtaggering
reſolutions) could once diuert from the tenour of his
intendments. You are to ſerue vnder his Banners, of
whom we may boldly ſay thus, <hi>Qui cum ab omnibus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertus
erat, ſeipſum tamen non deſerit,</hi> When he was forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the two <hi>Anhalts, Ausberge,</hi> and other Princes of
the Vnion, neuer forſooke himſelfe, nor left the cauſe
of the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> in the ſuds. Are you to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with your Enemies in <hi>Campania?</hi> vnder whoſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
can you ſuſtaine the ſhock of Hoſtile oppoſition
better then vnder his, who beate <hi>Leopoldus</hi> men in their
owne Quarters at <hi>Hagenawe,</hi> killed <hi>Bawer</hi> the Duke of
<hi>Bauariaes</hi> General in his lodging at <hi>Heſeldorff,</hi> &amp; fought
that memorable battell of <hi>Fleury</hi> neere <hi>Namurs,</hi> wherein
fifteene thouſand of his men vanquiſht ſixteene thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
of <hi>Gonſaluo de Cordabaes</hi> troupes, &amp; 20000. Boores
of their party beſides? Are you to make a retrait from
the purſuing enemie? Is not this that braue Conductor,
who made that famous retraite from <hi>Bohemia</hi> into the
<hi>Palatinate,</hi> and from thence vnto <hi>Breda,</hi> a tract of ſixe
hundred Engliſh miles at leaſt? which conſidering the
valour and aduantage of the purſuers, was not inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
vnto that retraite of <hi>Zenophons</hi> from out of <hi>Perſia,</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:7775:21"/>
nor that of <hi>Conons</hi> from <hi>Aquilia</hi> into <hi>Britannie.</hi> Are you
to beſiege Towne or Fortreſſe? Conſider then how
the Count forced <hi>Pilſen,</hi> a principall towne in <hi>Bohemia,</hi>
which <hi>Ziſcha anuo</hi> 1470. could not ſubdue, nor the <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites</hi>
in their ten moneths ſiege, <hi>anno</hi> 1434. could not
conquer; and this he did being weakely accompanied,
and beyond the expectation of humane reaſon. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this beſides, how that after the defeate of <hi>Zablatti,</hi>
he rallied his troupes in the Winter ſeaſon, wonne <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,
Prachalis,</hi> and <hi>Wintenberg,</hi> one after another, and
though detained by <hi>Chriſtian</hi> of <hi>Anhaults</hi> letters, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
<hi>Piſack,</hi> a ſtrong place, &amp; of importance, &amp; wonne
this Towne the ſixth of December, inforcing nature
as the ſaid <hi>Chriſtian</hi> wrote vnto him. Are you diſtreſſed
for want of meanes and victuals, ſo that you haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the ayre and your ſwords to liue by? remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
how yee ſhall martch vnder that Generall, who
maintained an Armie conſiſting of diuers Nations and
different humours, like another <hi>Hanniball</hi> without mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinie,
yet without pay for three yeares together, filling
their panches &amp; their purſes with the plentifull ſpoiles
of <hi>Alſatia, Metz,</hi> and <hi>Triers,</hi> and with the abundant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſions
of <hi>Emden, Munſter,</hi> and <hi>Weſtphalia?</hi> To be briefe,
are you to actuate or endure any thing, remember this
that you doe it vnder the fortune, valour, and good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Count <hi>Mansfield.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond motiue which may ſerue to encourage
vs, is the ſufficient prouiſion of meanes prouided for
this iourney, as men, munition, victuals, and money:
the ſinewes, by which Warre is ſupported, and all
Martial enterpriſes are brought to a happy accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7775:21"/>
Our men are thoſe Laconian walls of bones,
which muſt make good this attempt againſt all oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and theſe are the chiefeſt Nations, and flower of
all Chriſtendome.</p>
            <p>The French haue beene held the beſt Cauallerie of
the world, ſeldome or neuer beaten, except it were by
our Engliſh Bils and Bowes; of theſe we ſhall haue ſixe
thouſand Carbins, and armed Curaiciers. The Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes
were held in the time of <hi>Guichardine,</hi> the beſt
foote of the world, and ſo much redoubted by the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,
that they durſt not encounter with them, except
they had foote companies of the ſame Nation: and of
theſe, we ſhall muſter eight or ten thouſand.</p>
            <p>Our Engliſh in theſe latter times, haue bin reputed
the beſt Battalions of Pikes in all Chriſtendome, and
whom the Spaniards in their ouer-valuing humor, will
acknowledge onely to be ſeconds vnto themſelues; and
of men fit to handle theſe Armes, <hi>England</hi> ſends forth
twelue thouſand. The vnexhauſted Mines of <hi>Britanie,</hi>
will furniſh theſe braue Troupes with Lead and Iron
for their Ammunition: our Magazins will ſupply their
wants with Serpentine and Corn-pouder for Shot and
Batterie, and our friends of the Continent will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
Waggons, Horſes, and other neceſſaries fit for
the conuoy of ſuch a Royall Army. Money will not
be wanting, nor I hope the mutinous ſound of Gelt will
neuer be heard in our Quarters, nor an Electo choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to
reforme the ſame; for beſides the liberall Contribution
of diuers noblemen of <hi>England,</hi> forwarder of this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe,
and the plentifull prouiſion of our Parliament in
that behalfe, <hi>Fraunce</hi> and <hi>Sauoy, Germanie</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:7775:22"/>
contribute towards the charges of this intended iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
But is there any man who doubts the want of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals,
whoſe courage depends vpon his Colon, and
who neuer fights well, but when his paunch is full?
Let this man whoſe thoughts are ſo vnſouldierlike,
knowe, that beſides our owne prouiſions, which I
hope wil be abundant and enough, <hi>France</hi> is contracted
vnto vs with a new alliance, and the frontier of that
Kingdome, againſt the higher and lower <hi>Germanie,</hi>
runneth a tract of fiue hundred miles at leaſt: So that
in all reaſon it cannot be farre from the ſeate of our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And can wee dreame then of want and ſcarcities,
hauing ſuch a plentifull friend to our neighbour, who
without all peraduenture, will furniſh vs with Graine,
Beefes, Muttons, and all other neceſſaries, which are
fit for the maintenance and preſeruation of an Armie?</p>
            <p>In the third and laſt place follow the cauſes, which
may moue and incite vs to this enterpriſe, and theſe
are of two ſorts, either of policie or of Religion. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the politique cauſes, I will enter no farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their myſterie, then duty and modeſty will giue mee
leaue: For I know there is a <hi>ſanctum ſanctorum</hi> of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie;
there is an inner Court of Royall Counſell, into
which no man ought to enter, except <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> put out
the golden rod of his admiſſion. Onely I will giue this
caution to thoſe ſpirits who are ouer-curious after this
Inqueſt, and deliberate continually with themſelues,
whether the recouerie of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> or the reuenge
of the Bauarians and Emperours wrongs be the cauſes
of this expedition, I will giue I ſay that caution which
his Maieſtie gaue in the laſt Parliament: That no man
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7775:22"/>
ſhould queſtion, whether the Empire, <hi>Bauaria,</hi> or any
other determinate place, ſhould be the ſeate of this
Warre, ſince the diſcouery of this particular cannot
chuſe but preiudice the preſent ſeruice: for an Enemie
warn'd is arm'd, ſecrecie is the ſpirit of action, and this
with an expedite deliuery, crownes all warlike exploits,
with ſucceſſe and glory.</p>
            <p>But concerning that point of Religion, I will enlarge
my ſpeech more freely, and boldly maintaine notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
any oppoſition to the contrary; that this
iourney is not <hi>pro focis</hi> alone, but <hi>pro aris,</hi> not for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
reſpects onely, but for conſcience, Religion, and
the propagation of the Goſpell concurring therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
And for the vindication of their wrongs, what
task can be too hard? what danger can be too difficult?
ſo that if we were to martch ouer the ſandy Deſerts of
<hi>Arabia,</hi> ouer the vnpaſſable wildes and woulds of <hi>Scithia</hi>
or the Frozen Slowes of <hi>Swethland</hi> and <hi>Muſcouia:</hi> if we
were to encounter with famine, fire, and ſword, nay
with all the terrours of mortality, and that their feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
conſideration ſhould terribilize their nature and
condition, we ſhould conſider what Chriſt ſuffered for
vs, and ſuffer any thing, yea all things with patience, for
his Religion, Truth, and Goſpell. Our Enemies haue
made Religion their ſtalking horſe, and our backs their
pack-horſe: by which meanes they haue impoſed a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
Florentine tricke vpon our credulous confidence,
and open breaſted, meaning.</p>
            <p>It remaines for vs, that wee ſhould recollect our
ſtrengths and ſpirits, make our reuenge as ſenſible as
our iniuries are prouoking, and martch at length ouer
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7775:23"/>
their bellies, who haue rid pack-ridge ſo long vpon
our backes. And to end, that our actions may pertake
of externall glory here, and after this life of eternall
glorification, let the ſeruice of God, our Country, and
the common cauſe, be the generall bent and ſcope of
all our enterpriſes, fighting for <hi>Dauids</hi> cauſe; let vs arme
our ſelues with <hi>Dauids</hi> reſolution, and let vs come
againſt them, who came againſt vs with ſhield, ſword,
and ſpeare, in the name of the Lord of Hoaſts, the God
of the Hoaſt of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and then hee that teacheth our
fingers to fight, and our hands to wage the Battell, ſhall
breake the cheeke-bone of our Enemies, and make
them become like thoſe Princes which periſhed at
<hi>Endor,</hi> euen durt and dung vnder our feete. <hi>Quod faxit
