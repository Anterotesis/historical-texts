            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>WITH what, and how great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies the Church of <hi>England</hi> now a-days is exerciſed, and with how potent, and likewiſe mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Enemies ſurrounded, we all indeed ſee and grievouſly reſent; but no wonder, conſidering we are well aſſured, that this has been almoſt the conſtant, and perpetual fate of Chriſt's Church, whereſoever conſtituted. For if we peruſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42626:5"/>
all the Eccleſiaſtick Hiſtories, derived down to us from the very times of the Apoſtles, we ſhall find no Age, wherein the Catholick Church has not been mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted, either by Hereticks, or Schiſmaticks, or both together. That is to ſay, Tares are ſown by the Enemy near the Wheat in the Lord's ground, and they'll grow together till the harveſt. But truly ſuch is the love of our God to his Ground, ſuch the benevolence of the Almighty towards his Church, that he'le ne're permit the Wheat to be ſuffocated by the Tares, the Evangelical Doctrine by Hereſy, and Diſcipline by Schiſm. And therefore we have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear our Church's ſuſtaining ſo many Aſſaults of its Adverſaries, ſeeing 'tis buoy'd up by an omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent God, as a pure, and ſound Member of his Univerſal Church. But truly the purer, and ſounder our Church is, and therefore more acceptable to God, the more, and fiercer Enemies it has among Men, who from one ſide to t'other ſet themſelves wholly againſt it, and if they can't deſtroy, at leaſt Endeavour to diſturb it. For on the one hand Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Prieſts, on the other Sectaries traduce, ſlander, and wound it in their words, and actions; they try all ways to obtrude their new Fangles and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies on us, and that ſo they may either utterly pull down, or corrupt our Church.</p>
            <p>But we in the mean while relying on Divine aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, fly to God alone, daily beſeeching him in the name of his only begotten Son, that he wou'd vouchſafe to defend, and maintain a Church of his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42626:5"/>
own making. And he has been ſo propicious to our Prayers, contrary to our Deſerts, in wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delivering Us at leaſt from one ſort of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, to wit, the Popiſh Recuſants, and has given us reaſon to hope, that they'l ne're be capacitated again to moleſt our Church.</p>
            <p>But even now one part remains, who tho' ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly of the ſame Faith, and Doctrin, yet being ſeduced either by Ignorance, or Error, or perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture ſome ſcruple of Conſcience, alledge I know not what crimes againſt the Diſcipline, and Rites of our Church, and for that reaſon refuſe Communion with us in God's Worſhip. And 'tis ſtrange, how great miſchiefs may ariſe from this apparently ſmall beginning? For hence it is that Altars are erected againſt Altars; hence proceed Factious Tumults, and Mutual Hatreds among Brethren; hence 'tis that God's Worſhip is neglected, and the very Sacraments, one being thruſt into corners, the other ſeldom cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated; hence it is, I am amaz'd to ſpeak, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious words are raſhly ſpoken againſt God, and againſt all Religion, as if it rather did afford mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for Diſcord, than Peace; hence laſtly thoſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular calamities, which threaten both Church, and State, and thereupon perpetually diſquiet both.</p>
            <p>Now that ſome remedy at length may be oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely apply'd even to theſe diſeaſes, His moſt Serene Majeſty has been pleaſed, doubtleſs by Divine inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to aſſemble the Biſhops, and whole Clergy of this Kingdom, that they may conſult by what
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42626:6"/>
methods theſe pernicious differences may at laſt be ſo compoſed, our Church looſing nothing of its Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Glory, nothing of its Authority, and Right, that they who diſſent from us, may be reduced to our Holy Communion, or at leaſt remain for ever deſtitute of all reaſons, I don't ſay juſt, which they never had, but of all ſpecious colours, which hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they have pretended for their Separation.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, that this is a great, and very difficult undertaking, but as pious as neceſſary, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore worthy of the utmoſt endeavours of our Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. And how great ſoever the Labour and Work may ſeem, although not leſs than to ſtrive againſt the Stream, yet we muſt not deſpair, if ſo that God be preſent, and influence our undertakings? And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we have ſo ofteen experienced his ſingular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in defending our Church, that we have no reaſon to doubt, but that He will be preſent and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious to our Importunities for it; whilſt all things are directed according to His Divine Will reveal'd to us in Holy Writ: Which both we and our Diſſenting Brethren hold to be the Supream Rule, whereby all Eccleſiaſtical Controverſies are to be judg'd.</p>
            <p>Now if we conſult theſe Sacred Oracles, we ſhall find all things in them neceſſary for the obtaining Eternal Salvation. But not ſo many things touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the external Polity of the Church, much leſs particular Rites neceſſarily requiſite for it: For tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God has left theſe to be us'd in every particular Church, according to thoſe general Rules he has
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42626:6"/>
deliver'd in the Holy Scriptures for that purpoſe: Such are, Let all things be done decently, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; Let all things be done for Edification: And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the like nature, with which the uſual Rites of our Church exactly agree. But what if a Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhou'd ariſe between two Provincial Churches, or between divers Members of the ſame Province concerning any Ceremony, have we no Precept nor Example in the Holy Scriptures to ſtifle it? 'Tis true, we have an Example, which ſhou'd indeed have the force of a Precept, in as much as 'tis pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd by the Holy Spirit of God; and upon this account committed to Sacred Writ, that it might be obſerv'd by all. But leſt I ſhou'd ſeem to ſpeak this for nothing, I think 'twill not be amiſs to explain briefly that of the Apoſtle, which we juſt now cited; eſpecially ſince nothing can be of greater uſe, and more neceſſary to be obſerv'd in all ſuch Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies as are to be decided by this Sacred Synod.</p>
            <p>Therefore in the firſt place you are to take notice, That there were among the Diſturbers of the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> Church newly ſetled, thoſe who held it decent for Men to be converſant in Publick Meetings, with their Heads cover'd, but Women uncover'd: Now the Apoſtle in this Chapter, from the Firſt to the Sixteenth Verſe, copiouſly reaſons againſt this Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, which ſome at that time began to introduce; and ſhews that the contrary ought to be obſerv'd every where. He argues firſt from Divine Teſtimony, not indeed directly, but by implication, for as much
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42626:7"/>
as it appears from the Word of God, that Man is the Image and Glory of God, and the Head of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but the Woman the Glory of the Man, made of Him and for Him. The Apoſtle largely handles this Argument to the Twelfth Verſe, and then takes another from the Law of Nature, and the common Cuſtoms of Men. <hi>Judge in your ſelves</hi> ſays he, <hi>is it comely that a Woman pray unto God uncovered? Doth not even nature it ſelf teach you</hi>? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But in the laſt place, he produces his cleareſt Argument compris'd in theſe words, <hi>But if any Man ſeem to be contentious, we have no ſuch cuſtom, neither the Churches of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which is the ſame as if he had ſaid, But if any Man is ſo contentious, as notwithſtanding theſe Reaſons, ſtill to contend, that 'tis lawful for a Man even cover'd, but a Woman uncover'd, publickly to pray unto God; yet there's one Argument be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, by which both he and all Chriſtians muſt of neceſſity confeſs themſelves convicted, which is this, <hi>That we have no ſuch cuſtom, neither the Churches of God</hi>: Now amongſt us and all other Churches, the quite contrary Cuſtom hath obtain'd, whereby Men are taught to uncover, but Women to cover their Heads when they join in the Service of God.</p>
            <p>I know that theſe words of the Apoſtle are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted a little otherwiſe by ſome: as if he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd thus, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That neither they nor the Churches of God have ſuch a Cuſtom, to contend
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42626:7"/>
about Matters of this nature. But beſides that, admitting this Expoſition, the Apoſtle wou'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict himſelf, becauſe in this very place he ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſputes with the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> Again, if we ſhou'd grant, that the Words may be thus expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it equally makes for our ſide; becauſe 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, even from this very ſenſe of the words, as well as the other, which is the true and genuine, and ſo conſpicuous and manifeſt, that it requires no further explication, that the Apoſtle diſputing concerning an Eccleſiaſtick Ceremony with the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Church, appeals to the Cuſtom of the other Churches of God. Nevertheleſs, this one thing we may note, That theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, are read in ſome <hi>Greek</hi> Manuſcripts in the ſingular Number, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as the <hi>Syrian</hi> Interpreter has it: Which are alſo the words of the Vulgar <hi>Latin</hi> Verſion; and the ſame is to be ſeen in St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and other <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers. But the ſenſe is all one. For <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, in the plural, tho indefinitely put, ſignify all the Churches of which the Univerſal conſiſts. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both ways, recourſe is had here to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church, and the Argument is drawn from her Cuſtom. For this reaſon St. <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſays of it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. This Argument is ſufficient to confute even the moſt contentious; For the Apoſtle ſhews, That not only he, but all the Churches of God think the ſame: So that he that acts contrary, oppoſes
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42626:8"/>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Univerſal Church, as <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylact,</hi> and before him St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> comments upon the place.</p>
            <p>Theſe Words of the Apoſtle being thus conciſely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd, fore-ſhew a plain and ſafe way to us by which we may proceed in the determination of all ſuch Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. But if any Rite us'd by ſome Provincial Church, is controverted, we muſt make a diligent Enquiry into the Sentiments of all other Churches, and ſee whether the ſame has been approv'd by them. For the illuſtration whereof, we muſt obſerve, That in all Ages even from our Saviour's Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſeveral Provincial Churches have been conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in the greateſt part of the World; which all together make that one Church, which we therefore commonly call Catholick or Univerſal. Which doubtleſs, muſt be computed from all the Churches, not only thoſe that exiſt at one and the ſame point of time, but that ever had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Moreover, all theſe in all Ages, and at all times, have agreed with the Church in neceſſary Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith. Now as to the Rites, they have been partly proper, and peculiar to particular Churches, partly common to all. Rites that are proper to one or two Churches, may be abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or retain'd by the ſame, or admitted by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers at pleaſure. For they put on the nature of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42626:8"/>
things indifferent, and therefore are of no force, unleſs what they receiv'd from that Church by whoſe Authority they are eſtabliſh'd. But Rites that have been always common to the Univerſal Church, that is, to all Churches throughout all Ages, or which is all one, to the greateſt part of them, the very ſame ought ſtill to be obſerv'd by every particular Church. For neither is it in the power of every particular Church, either to reject Rites when obſerv'd, or obſerve them when reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Univerſal Church. If any of theſe ſhall do either of the two, 'tis Schiſmatical, disjoining it ſelf from the Body of Chriſt, at leaſt in that particular. But that every Church may be rightly conſtituted, ſo as to be made a ſound Member of the Catholick, 'tis abſolutely neceſſary for her to conform her ſelf to that in all things, as long as it may be done, and religiouſly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace her Diſcipline and Rites, as well as her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin. Which, leſt I may ſeem to ſpeak without reaſon, I'le confirm with the following Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Theſe very Words of my Text ſupply us with one. For certainly the <hi>Corinthian</hi> was a Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Church, into which ſome endeavour'd to bring new Rites. The Apoſtle being aſcertain'd of this, diſputes againſt it in this place; and proves that that Church cou'd by no means admit of it. And his laſt and chief Argument he draws from the Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42626:9"/>
of the Univerſal Church, as we obſerv'd before: Foraſmuch as all other Churches ſhould have no ſuch, but a quite contrary Cuſtom. <hi>But if any man,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſeem to be contentious, we have no ſuch cuſtom; neither the Churches of God.</hi> From which words I thus argue:</p>
            <p>What's contrary to the receiv'd Cuſtom of all the Churches, ought not to be admitted by the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is contrary to the receiv'd Cuſtom of all the Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> was not oblig'd to accommodate her ſelf to, and obſerve the Rites of all the other Churches, this Argument of the Apoſtle would be of no weight. For by this ſuppoſition, that Church might have admitted that Rite, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding 'twas contrary to a Cuſtom Univerſally receiv'd: And therefore the major propoſition wou'd be falſe. But undoubtedly the Apoſtle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued rightly, being divinely inſpired when he penn'd theſe Words: Which is a cogent reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not deceive by the Argument, nor be deceiv'd in the manner of arguing. And therefore a principal reaſon obliges every ſuch Provincial Church, as the <hi>Corinthian</hi> was, diligently to obſerve the Rites of the Univerſal. For if any neglect the obſervance of them, he is by this infallible Argument, convinc'd of a grievous <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Schiſm.</hi> Neither is it poſſible for him to defend himſelf by any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42626:9"/>
ſince God himſelf dictated this Argument to the Apoſtle, and from thence it neceſſarily follows, That 'tis the Will of God that every Provincial Church ſhould conform to the Univerſal: And alſo that we always uſe this way of arguing which he has taught us, to determine all Controverſies of the like nature.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the ſame appears from the very nature and notion of a Church: For the Church generally ſo called, is a vaſt Society, or Congregation of Men profeſſing the Chriſtian Faith in all parts of the World: Whereof all Provincial Churches are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Parts or Members. Now in all ſuch Societies every Part ought to agree with its whole: And conſequently the leſſer with the greater.</p>
            <p>Reaſon tells us this; The Law of nature commands it; and the Univerſal conſent of Mankind judges it neceſſary. So that, if any thing enacted by the greater, obliges the remaining part, much more what is ordain'd by the greateſt part of each Society; which it ought to obſerve if it wou'd continue a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and enjoy the Priviledges of the ſame Society. Which rule, ſince it prevails in all manner of Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ought much more in the Church; which of all things ſhould be the moſt Regular.</p>
            <p>Accordingly Chriſt himſelf is the head of this Church, called Univerſal, who equally diffuſes his
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42626:10"/>
Spirit thro' all its parts. The Apoſtle in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and elſewhere in many places ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains this idea, or notion of the Church. Seeing therefore the Spirit of Chriſt himſelf is diffuſed thrô all the Members of this Body; and both guides, and governs them, whatſoever is performed by theſe Members let it be (as it ought) aſcrib'd to his Holy Spirit. For althô each Member is able, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to ſuffer ſome humane affliction, which yet all have done conjointly at all times, it cou'd ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceed from any thing leſs than a common (if I may ſo ſay) Principle of all things, namely, the Spirit of God which generally actuates all things. And therefore it can't but be neceſſary to be ſtill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd (as much as may be) by every Member.</p>
            <p>The next Argument on this occaſion is fetcht from the Apoſtolical Inſtitution of all ſuch Rites, which are obſerved by the Univerſal Church. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Apoſtles in the firſt inſtitution of the Churches delivered for their obſervation, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly neceſſary to their legitimate conſtitution. For otherwiſe they muſt have appointed ſomething ſuperfluous, which can't be alledg'd againſt the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, conſidering that they have inſtituted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Church, but what was enjoyn'd them by Heaven.</p>
            <p>Which ſince all Chriſtians believe, they agree in nothing more, than that the Apoſtolical Inſtitution
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42626:10"/>
of the Churches is a Rule, and Meaſure, according to which every preſent Church is to be model'd. So that no Conſtitution of any Church can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Legitimate, unleſs it be conſonant thereto. Now this being granted, it follows that no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church is lawfully conſtituted, unleſs it obſerves all the Rites of the Univerſal. For whatſoever ſhe hath obſerved in all ages, muſt be of Apoſtolical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. For how is it poſſible for any one to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that all the Churches diſperſed over the face of the Earth ſhou'd every where uſe the ſame modes, unleſs they received them together with their Faith by Apoſtolick Tradition?</p>
            <p>'Tis very clear, that the Apoſtles went about al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all Parts, and appointed Churches, where ever they came: 'Tis clear that they were conducted by the ſame Spirit: And laſtly 'tis clear, that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd Uniformity in all Churches. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis no wonder, if they have every where or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the ſame Rites: 'Twou'd have rather been a wonder, if they had done otherwiſe. Now if ſuch general Rites were not by Apoſtolick appointment, how cou'd they every where come into Chucrhes ſo far diſtant from each others? Cou'd they from General Councils? For that indeed remains to be ſpoken to. For they muſt of neceſſity either be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the Apoſtles, or by Oecumenical Councils, as Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> obſerves in his Epiſtle to <hi>Januarius,</hi> wherein he ſays, <hi>We preſerve things not written, but
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42626:11"/>
delivered, which are indeed obſerv'd all the World over; whereby we may underſtand, that things recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and decreed either by the Apoſtles, or Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils, (whoſe authority the Church venerates) are retain'd.</hi> Now we in this place ſpeak only of ſuch Rites, as were obſerv'd by the Univerſal Church before General Councils had their being, and which for this reaſon cou'd not be inſtituted by them. It remains therefore, that we attribute them only to Apoſtolical Inſtitution, according to that common rule of the ſame Learned Father, who ſays, <hi>That the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church holds not what's inſtituted by Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, but always retain'd, which being deliver'd only by Apoſtolical Authority, is truly believed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore ſince 'tis neceſſary to legitimate the Conſtitution of every Church, that the Rites in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by the Apoſtles be retain'd: And ſince all the Rites of the Univerſal are appointed by the Apoſtles themſelves, none can doubt, but that the obſerving the ſame is neceſſarily requir'd to the Legal Conſtitution of every particular Church.</p>
            <p>And this indeed is not my private Opinion, but is, and ever was the common Sentiment of all Chriſtians, eſpecially the Primitive. This appears from hence, that in times paſt, if any Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy aroſe concerning any Eccleſiaſtical Rite, which ſome peculiar Church had receiv'd, 'twas always cuſtomary to enquire into the Practice of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal; and her conſtant uſage touching that Rite, and afterwards to give in their Verdict.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42626:11"/>
Examples are very obvious, how ever I'le chuſe one for the preſent. The Primitive Church, you all know, was long perplex'd with a grievous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention concerning the time of the celebration of the Paſsover. For the Church of <hi>Aſia</hi> contended with the <hi>Jews,</hi> that 'twas to be celebrated on the fourteenth day after the appearance of the Moon, let it fall on whatſoever Holy-day of the Week it would. Now all other Churches were wont to faſt, and celebrate that Feaſt only on the day of our Lord's Reſurrection. This controverſie continued for many Years, till at length 'twas complain'd of in the general Council held at <hi>Nice.</hi> Where 'twas prov'd, that all other Churches, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that of <hi>Aſia,</hi> us'd to celebrate that Feaſt on the Lord's day, and for that reaſon all the Fathers, that were preſent at that Synod, thought it fit, and reaſonable, for the <hi>Aſian</hi> Church to celebrate it on the ſame day: As the great Emperor, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> expreſly aſſerts in an Epiſtle to the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es by whoſe command that Synod was ſummon'd. From whence it appears that the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers us'd the ſame arguments againſt the <hi>Aſian</hi> Church, that the Apoſtle do's againſt the <hi>Corinthian,</hi> which he deduces from the Cuſtom of all the other Churches. Alſo St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> has the ſame againſt <hi>Novatian,</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> againſt the Donatiſts: But <hi>Epiphanius</hi> brings it againſt all Hereticks, and likewiſe Schiſmaticks, condemning them all of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, that either in Doctrine or Diſcipline Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42626:12"/>
from the Univerſal Church. I might ſeem too prolix, and tedious, if I ſhould but point out all the Councils, and Fathers, that have us'd this argument; and therefore our Propoſition may well be inferr'd from them. For this Argument, which the Catholick Church has always us'd, takes for granted, that 'tis at leaſt juſt, and rational, that all her rites ſhou'd be every where retain'd.</p>
            <p>Upon which account we have more largely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted this ſubject, becauſe hereby we may the better, when occaſion ſerves, repreſs all the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of our Church; even the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who aſſuming the Name of Catholicks, do inſolently Glory in it. For the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church whoſe Faith, and Cuſtoms all Papiſts are ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engag'd to maintain, hath invented ſo many new Tenets, and lately innovated ſo many ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Ceremonies, either rejected, or unknown to the Univerſal, and is at this day ſo imperious in her commands, that ſhe only deſerves the name of a moſt corrupted, much leſs Catholick Church. For ſhe has nothing common with the Catholick, nothing with all other Churches, but rather all things Diſſentaneous, and Repugnant, excepting, wherein ſhe agrees with ours.</p>
            <p>But omitting theſe things, as not pertinent to this place, let's rather advance thoſe things which we have hitherto diſcours'd, that we may
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42626:12"/>
the better accompliſh the Buſineſs in hand.</p>
            <p>Now then 'tis apparent from what we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready premis'd, how expedient it is, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rites and Manners obſerv'd hitherto by the Univerſal, that the ſame ſhould alſo now be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by every particular Church. Juſt ſo 'tis even in Bodies Politick. As for inſtance, in this very Kingdom there are divers Corporations, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs, and other inferiour Fraternities, all which are impower'd to give Laws to themſelves, and to their Members; Provided always, they neither do, nor enact any thing <hi>Contrary to the Statutes of this Realm, or</hi> (as we ſay) <hi>to the Common Law, or any ancient Cuſtom, that has been introduc'd, and receiv'd in this Kingdom time out of mind, and ſo has obtain'd the force of a Law.</hi> Almoſt after the ſame manner 'tis with the Univerſal Church, which is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt. For this has it's Decrees written in the Word of God, and alſo has as it were a Common Law conſiſting of ſome certain Rites. Which tho' they be not expreſly, and in juſt ſo many words, commanded in the ſaid Decrees, yet are ſo adapted (if I may ſo ſay) to the general deſign and purport of them, and ſo uſeful for the Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Eſtabliſhment of that Religion, which is inſtituted there, that they have been obſerv'd at all times, and every where throughout the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World, and for that reaſon are ſtill to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by all Churches, that are deſirous of holding
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42626:13"/>
a firm Union, and Communion with the Univerſal. For if any Church ſhall aboliſh any one of theſe Rites, or conſtitute any thing contrary to them, the ſame will thereby be depriv'd of that Cuſtom, which all the other Churches of God enjoy. Which thing indeed the Apoſtle charges the <hi>Corinthians</hi> with as a fault. And deſervedly too. Becauſe it can't poſſibly be deem'd a leſſer Crime to diſannul the common Rites of the Univerſal Church, than to violate the Common Law of the Realm. That this is great, 'tis generally acknowledg'd, and ſome to their own Coſt have found it ſo. But perhaps ſome will judge me guilty of a fault, in pleading hitherto for Rites, and not ſhewing what they are, or how to know them. But truly this don't belong to me, who have hitherto deſign'd nothing more, than to demonſtrate, how juſt, and equitable it is, that (for inſtance) our, or any other Provincial Church, ſhou'd religiouſly obſerve all ſuch Rites, which, 'tis certain, all other Churches have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd: Now what peculiar Rites ought to be rank'd here, and from whence that appears, I leave unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided to your Judgments. Perchance ſome of them will be debated here before you: For that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I've forbore mentioning the leaſt of them in this place, for fear I ſhou'd ſeem to anticipate your more diſcerning Judgments in theſe Affairs. But there are ſome general Inſtitutions of the Univerſal Church, which (if I miſtake not) are indiſputable, and yet ſeem momentous to the determining ſuch
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42626:13"/>
caſes as will be laid open, in this Sacred Synod: Therefore I can't quite paſs them by, leſt I ſhou'd ſeem to fall ſhort of performing the duty laid on me.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Therefore all the Churches of God have this Cuſtom, and always had, that in whatſoever Province they are plac'd, the Biſhops, and Paſtors of that Province, as often as occaſion requires, and opportunity permits may ſummon Synods or Conventions to deliberate, and conſult about affairs relating to the Church in the ſame Province. Which Synods therefore are call'd Convocations, or Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Councils. This ſufficiently appears from thoſe huge and numerous volumes of Councils, in which you may ſee ſeveral ſuch like Councils held in all Ages, and all Provinces over the whole Chriſtian world. And far more, doubtleſs, are celebrated, that are neither extant there, nor in any other place at preſent. Which, I thought fit to note here, that any one may plainly ſee, that this our Synodical Convocation is no Innovation. Becauſe nothing was ever more uſual in all the Churches of God than the celebration of ſuch Provincial Councils.</p>
            <p>Add to this, that all Churches every where ſo Synodically congregated, were always us'd to create ſuch Canons, or Eccleſiaſtick Laws, as they judg'd to be Expedient for the better adminiſtration of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42626:14"/>
the publick Worſhip of God, his Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Diſcipline of the whole Church. This alſo abundantly appears from the ſaid Acts of Councils: In which there are divers Canons ſet forth by every Provincial Church, as proper, and peculiar to itſelf. For tho' all the common Churches of God have ſcrupulouſly retain'd the rites of the Univerſal; yet they were always forc'd to add o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the Canons of the Church, that were adapted to the form and modes of that Kingdom or Province wherein each Church was ſituated: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it were almoſt impoſſible for any Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial or National Church to ſubſiſt long in Peace. From hence alſo a common Cuſtom has obtain'd in all the Churches of God, when all ſuch Canons, and Laws are Conſtituted, to have regard not only to the well-being of any private member, but alſo to the Peace, and Tranquillity of the whole Church. And indeed many things are neceſſary to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing this that are not to our obtaining everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing felicity. For which reaſon almoſt all the Canons, publiſhed hitherto by Provincial, or General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils are inſtituted only for ſuch things, that make for the external Diſcipline, and Peace of the Church. And hence 'tis alſo, that never any Church was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, which did not regiſter ſeveral things amongſt their Laws, not againſt, but beſides thoſe things, which are contain'd in holy Writ. Which is ſo clear, and perſpicuous, that I can't enough won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how any one can doubt of the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:42626:14"/>Beſides 'tis cuſtomary in all the Churches of God to ratify ſuch Canons, as they make, with Eccleſiaſtick Penances, to prevent impunity, when they are violated. This likewiſe appears from the Canons of all the Councils, upon which a man can ſcarce caſt his eye, but preſently at the firſt ſight ſee Suſpenſion, or Depoſition, Anathema, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication againſt Lay-men, if they ſhall act o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. For neither has the Church ever eſteem'd thoſe worthy of the Sacred Miniſtry, nor theſe of her Communion, who refuſe to obey Laws writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as well for theirs, as its own advantage.</p>
            <p>Further 'tis evident out of the aforeſaid Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Councils, that all the Churches of God were wont ſo to frame, and temper theſe Laws, which they thought neceſſary for themſelves, that they might be advantageous to, and edifying of the whole Community, and as much as poſſible, inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive. I ſaid, as much as poſſible, by reaſon their ignorance is ſuch, that they ſcarce are ſenſible of any thing: Such is the perverſeneſs of others, that they wreſt all to the worſt ſenſe. And truly 'tis hardly poſſible for any Civil Law, much leſs Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical, to be ſo made, as to be approv'd by all. Therefore there's no reaſon, that the Church ſhou'd be ſollicitous for this ſort of men, unleſs perhaps, that they may be better taught in diſcipline and manners by the force of the Laws. Again, others there are, who endeavour to ſerve God piouſly,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42626:15"/>
and devoutly, and to direct their lives according to his Commands, and yet are of ſo weak, and Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous a Conſcience, that nothing almoſt can be done, that do's not prove offenſive to them, and that too (as we ſhould charitably believe) not from an obſtinacy of will, or ſtiff inclination to any Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but from ſome pious, tho' groundleſs fear, leſt it ſhou'd be diſpleaſing to God. And truly theſe men are to be taken into conſideration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Laws are confirm'd, eſpecially Eccleſiaſtick, leſt, inſtead of eradicating old Scruples, we ſhou'd implant new ones in their minds. And that alſo, whether they, who are thus troubl'd in conſcience, wait on God's Altar together with the Church, or ſeparately from it. For both are to be taken care of; theſe, that they may perſevere in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of our Church, the other, that they may be brought back to it. And certainly this is a work, and labour, deſerving the cares and ſtudies of us all. Which nevertheleſs is to be ſo enterpriz'd that nothing, for their ſakes, may be omitted, that ſhall redound to the Intereſt of the Church, nor admitted, that ſhall prove detrimental to the ſame. For neither reaſon nor the perpetual Cuſtom of the Church ſuffers a part to be preferable to the whole.</p>
            <p>We may add further, That nothing has been more uſual amongſt the Churches of God, than to change Laws, that they've made, to abrogate
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42626:15"/>
ancient ones, and to ſubſtitute others, perhaps quite different, in their room, when a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous time requires it. None converſant in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick Hiſtories can be ignorant of this. For you can find no Church throughout the World, that has all the ſame Laws now, which it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had. Doubtleſs, all ſuch Laws of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Churches, whereof we now ſpeak, are conſtituted <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> (if I may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to ſpeak barbarouſly here) that is, with reſpect to time, and place. When theſe are chang'd, the Laws of Neceſſity muſt be chang'd for their accommodation to the preſent Cuſtoms of every Age and Place. But truly no Church ever did, or muſt do this without cogent Neceſſity. For every unneceſſary alteration in Eccleſiaſtick Laws, ſtigmatizes the Church with inconſtancy; and too much derogates from the Authority given it by our Bleſſed Saviour; it makes Prophane Wretches call Religion into Queſtion, whether or no it depends on the Will of Man? It ſets ſeveral together by the ears; and keeps more ſtill in a dubious expectation of ſome new at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: It renders the minds of others doubtful, and uncertain what to do: It ſtirs up outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Tumults, often diſturbing the Publick Peace. Neither alſo is any one ſo Skilful in the diſpoſal, and proviſion of things, as to be able to foreſee by any Art, what, and how great Miſeries may be ariſing even from the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42626:16"/>
mutation of Laws incommodious. And therefore the changing of inveterate Laws for others, is at all times dangerous, unleſs ſuch Neceſſity may compel, as is otherwiſe inſuperable, and which is ſo manifeſt and apparent to the Eyes of all, that none may ſee a change, without ſeeing great Reaſon, and Neceſſity for it. Now if there be ſuch a Neceſſity, all thoſe Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will be averted, that generally attend on unneceſſary change. Our Church will not loſe a drachm of Honour or Eſteem, that's due to her. For ſhe, and her Authority will be the ſame. And all things will appear more peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, calm, fix'd, and quiet in her, than if they had kept their former State. All the Churches of God are taught this by Experience: And for this reaſon they never Scruple to abdicate Laws of their own Conſtitution, and to Confirm new ones, as often as they ſee occaſion.</p>
            <p>Now whether our Church be oblig'd by ſuch a Neceſſity to alter any thing that's ſetled by her Laws, belongs to Wiſe Men, not me, to determine.</p>
            <p>This only I'le preſume to ſay, that, if it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to bring back wandring Sheep to Chriſt's Fold, if neceſſary, to remove Scruples from the Conſciences of weak Brethren: If neceſſary to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh Hatred, mitigate Anger, and reconcile all Differences, as far as poſſible about Religion: If neceſſary to reſtore Eccleſiaſtick Diſcipline to its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42626:16"/>
vigour: If neceſſary to defend, and maintain the beſt Church on Earth againſt the Efforts of Men, and Devils: I ſay, If any one thinks theſe neceſſary, certainly he muſt likewiſe think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to admit of ſuch Alterations as in his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion are moſt conducive to this purpoſe: Whilſt only thoſe things are chang'd, which our Church has conſtituted by her Authority, not thoſe, which the Univerſal Church has Eſtabliſh'd by her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law. For all the Churches of God, and ours too, have always religiouſly forborn, (let the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence be what it will) the leaſt Alteration in theſe Laws. For to aboliſh, or reject what has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and every where obſerv'd, is not only to change an Eccleſiaſtick Rite, but alſo the Church it ſelf, and render it different from all the Churches of God. Which yet never cou'd, nor, I hope, ever will be ſaid of our Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>For truly ſuch was the care, and diligence of our Reformers, (whoſe happy memory we can never ſufficiently extol, and reverence) ſuch their Piety and Religion, ſuch their divinely inſpir'd Prudence, that, thinking it as neceſſary to keep firm Communion with the Catholick, as to recede from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, renouncing all her Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Innovations, they themſelves religiouſly preſerv'd whatever had been approv'd by all the Churches of God; and ſo ordain'd it in our Church, the moſt illuſtrious Image and Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42626:17"/>
of the Catholick. And hence 'tis that our Church has always been the envy of the <hi>Roman</hi>: But ſo great an honour to all the Reform'd Churches, that I don't doubt, but that they wou'd imitate her pious Examples, were it in their power: So that we muſt not impute it to them, but to the neceſſities of time, and place, that they are not in all things agreeable to us.</p>
            <p>Since therefore God has committed ſuch a Church to our care; and ſince his Vicegerent here has now given us an opportunity to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute all things, that may tend to the peace, and advantage of his Church, let us employ all our powers and faculties for its accompliſhment. Let us leave no means unattempted, to make all Engliſh-men to be of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Let us endeavour all we can, to make her Faith, her Worſhip, and her Diſcipline, if poſſible, the wonder of the whole world, and ſhe her ſelf perpetual, by whoſe guidance we of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom may obtain everlaſting Salvation thro' Chriſt, till his ſecond coming. That all poſterity may laud, and magnifie our God for moving ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious a Prince to aſſemble this Sacred Synod, and aſſigning ſuch a preparation for it to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of this our Church. If this Convocation ſhall be ſo pleas'd, to whoſe diſpoſal all things are left. But whilſt we are conſidering of theſe things, we call to mind the ancient Cuſtoms ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42626:17"/>
by all God's Churches, in the calm and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date Celebration of their Synods: And let ours take example by that. Let us throw off all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced Opinions, preſumptuous Suſpitions, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigious Contentions, which only confound and diſturb ſuch Sacred Councils. But let all be done with that agreement, and conſent, as becomes Chriſtians, Clergy-men, and more eſpecially all us of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when we conſult about the Eſtabliſhment of her Peace. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we do, let it be done by univerſal Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That in this we may truly ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>If any man ſeem to be contentious, we have no ſuch cuſtom, neither the Churches of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whatſoever pains we take for the good of our Church they'l avail not, unleſs adorn'd with good works: Wherefore moſt Reverend Fathers in Chriſt, and dearly beloved Brethren give me leave to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you in the name of Chriſt, ſo to comport your ſelves, as Becomes Fathers, and Sons of ſo holy a Church: <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they ſeeing your good works, may glorify your Father in Heaven?</hi> Let all ſee and admire the eminent Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in producing men moſt holy. By this means we ſhall engage not only men, but God to be of our ſide. Who alone is able to defend, and for ever preſerve a Church firſt of his own building, and then reſtoration, from all the Machinations of its enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:42626:18"/>
               <hi>Let God therefore ariſe, and his enemies be ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd. God grant that our Church may flouriſh and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe daily more and more. God grant that the Gates of Hell may ne're prevail againſt it. Laſtly God grant, that his moſt holy Spirit may guide this Sacred Synod aſſembled in his name, and lead them into all truth, that whatſoever they do, may end in the glory of God, the good and ſettlement of the Univerſal Church, and more eſpecially, this of</hi> England, <hi>through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to whom with the Father, and holy Spirit be aſcrib'd all glory, and honour now and evermore,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
