            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

RIGHT HONOV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RABLE,
the Lords and
COMMONS assembled in the High
Court of Parliament.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>IGHT Honourable Lords, and
worthy Gentlemen, We are all
imbarqued in the ship, the
Common-wealth; and as in a
ship there are divers Agents,
whereof some of the chiefest,
at the sterne to governe; others
of an inferiour rank clime the
Mast, hoysesailes, and doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
workes in it, all of them according to their severall
ranke, as they doe the duties of their severall places; so
have interest in the Common good, and either doe, or ought
to mind the publike welfare of it: And as in building of
the Tabernacle, some of the chiefe sort brought gold, silver
<pb facs="tcp:63456:3"/>
and precious stones, others of inferiour sort, goats haire and
Badgers skins, every man according to his ability, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
unto the same. I, though but of the inferiour rank in
this ship, even the meanest of all others, yet imbarqued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
see not but I ought to endeavour, though but in inferiour
workes the good of it, who though I have not gold, silver, or

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s stones, nor any thing besides my poore prayers to
advance the glorious Tabernacle, yet would with <hi>Ahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maaz,</hi>
run also, as one willing and desirous to doe good, if I
had any ability in my selfe, or opportunity: But having
nothing of my owne, finding this little Manuscript among
the papers of my deare deceased brother, and considering
the troublesomenesse of the times the feares of the better
sort, and hopes of the worse: I have adventured to make
it publike, which though written some time since, and upon
another occasion, yet there may something be gathered out of
it (if I mistake not my selfe) which may bee of good use
for these present times of our feares, and sad apprehensions,
wherin if there be any thing which in your grave wisdoms,
you may thinke fit to put in execution, it shall much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

me, that I brought it to the light, or at least, if it may but
occasion your wisedomes to take into your serious considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the subject matter of it, which is the securing of the
Kingdome against all dangers, that may come to it, and in
your wisedomes to thinke upon better directions, that may
remove the fears and apprehensions of most men in these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous
times, by reason of the Insurrection of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Kingdome, and the just feares we have of these
pestilent enemies of our Church and Common-wealth, The
Papists in this Kingdome, and their Adherents, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates:
Now as concerning my brothers manuscript, as it
was penned in time of a great Sea preparation made by the
<pb facs="tcp:63456:3"/>
French King some ten yeares past, so (as I had it from his
owne mouth) it gained the approbation and good liking of his
Majesty, who commanded him to write his judgement and
opinion of these preparations, and by what meanes (if they
were intended against us) wee might secure our selves, both
for the pesent, and in future; which though for some reasons
was not thought sit to be put in execution, yet I have beene
encouraged by some of good judgement, now to publish it in
these times, wherein wee have some more apprehension of
danger then formerly (partly by the actuall rising of these
many ill affected to Religion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and also those
proud-threatning speeches lately given forth by the Papists
here at home, which if not by some such course, as is here
propounded, bee prevented, may breed more danger then
most are sensible of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eliahs</hi> cloud rose but like a hand, which after orespread
the whole heaven, what this may doe, if suffered to enlarge
itselfe; how farrereach, we cannot directly say; but even
to our owne Horison wee may well presume, if not repelled,
or dispersed by a strong and swift gale The mischiefe
they carry with them cannot bee contayned in the neighbour
Kingdome, if they thus grow in their progresse. What
combination there may be with forrainstates I leave to deeper
judgements, but for my owne part, I shall ever subscribe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the opinion of that noble Lord, concerning an old Enemy
the Spaniard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if he ever find an opportunity, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
against us, hee will not baulke it: I cannot easily
be drawne to a beleefe, that that great Fleet they sent two
yeares since upon our Coast, when wee and our true hearted
brethren, the <hi>Scots,</hi> were ready to enter into a bloody
battle, was to guard only his Souldiers, or treasure; but
that there was a designe in it upon this Kingdome, though by
<pb facs="tcp:63456:4"/>
Gods mercy prevented. Never came such a Fleet upon our
Coast, save in 88. when they intended a reall invasion.
But if it be objected; was he not in league with us? But
alas, what security can we have thereby, in being in league
with him, or any of that Religion: when first they hold
that it is no fault to breake faith with Hereticks. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
If it be? The Popes dispensation will take it away. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if the Pope find it for his advantage hee will so charge
them to breake with us, that so conscience and obedience
shall cure their malice and perfideousnesse: I am bold to
adde to what my brother wrote, what once, long since I
read in a little Treatise, which may something conduce to
this, of that brave Lord, the late Earle of <hi>Essex;</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
in an Apology in the late Queens time of happy memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which may something strengthen my brothers opinion
for making Sea preparations; which with my Brothers, I
humbly offer to your considerations, there being none under
Heaven to whom we can addresse our selves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for power and
fitnesse to correct the malignant aspect of these influences,
besides your honours: And now most noble, and grave Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators,
the true and ever renouned Patriots of your Country,
if my Zeale for my countries freedome and prosperity, have
borne me beyond my bounds, impute it to my errour of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and let your candor close with the good intentions of
him, who is more in wishes, and hearty desires, then in
parts and abilities, for the felicity of his Countrey. And
he shall ever remaine,</p>

friend, Sir <hi>Edward, Harwood</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell
of an English Regiment in the

presse, and ready thereunto, when by Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
providence I coming over (having had much
experience of his worth;) and in some respect,
obliged unto him, was not a little glad to meet with
an oportunity to shew my love and respects to him.
I therefore desired leave of his brother, of whom
I have now obtained it, though with some difficulty,
to offer to the World some Testimony of it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I will forbeare to say what I may, neither is there
need for mee in that kind to say any thing at all, in
respect of those that knew him, and have beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
with him; they have beene eye witnesses
to more then I write, but for their sakes, who did
not know him: I desire a little to acquaint them with
his worth. To the end, that they, who have alove
to that Honourable profession, may have a worthy
example to incite them to imitation.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:63456:5"/>
It being my portion to travell with him one
whole night not loing before his decease; Hee was
(beyond his custome) kept awake all that time by
his owne Spirit, which constrained him to open his
bosome to mee, and to give mee an Epitome of his
time, and Gods dealing with him, of which, and
my owne observations concerning him, you may
please to take this briefe extract.</p>
            <p>His Birth was Gentile, and from a roote fit to
engraft his future education and excellency; fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
hee was with such learning as his age was
capable of, and grew up in an especiall respect unto
the faithfull Dispensors of the Gospell, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
reapt the fruits of it in Gods season.
His spirit (though sad enough) yet accompanied
with much naturall mettall and courage, and look't
above other callings, to that which narrow min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and effeminate men close not with.</p>
            <p>Hee soone attended the Schoole of warre of those
times, where quick and curious designes issued into
dayly action and execution. There my Lord <hi>Veere,</hi>
who could well distinguish of men, cast his eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, by whose favour, exhal'd by his owne
worth, hee was not long ascending the usuall step
whereon the warres placeth reward for its fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers;
as hee grew skilfull in his trade, so was hee
amiable to others: They live who know how deare
hee was to that justly lamented, Prince <hi>Henry,</hi>
who tooke such delight in him, that his closset
thoughts were open to my Noble friend, from
whom that Noble Prince got no smale advantage
in his military way; Hee was also ever precious to
<pb facs="tcp:63456:5"/>
King <hi>Iames,</hi> of blessed memory; so also no lesse
in the esteeme of our now gracious Soveraigne,
witnessing their Royall affection toward him in
severall expressions of their favours. The illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Princesse, the Queene of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> who hearing
of his death, cried out in a great passion! <hi>Oh that uggly
Towne of Mastricht that hath bereeved mee of so faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
a Servant.</hi> Also to that mirrour of his time, the
last Lord <hi>Harrington,</hi> to whom hee was so endeared,
that hee offered to hazard estate, liberty, and life, for
his good, as by divers of his Letters still extant,
appeares. To the late Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who after
the defeat at the Ile of <hi>Ree,</hi> remembring what ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
hee did at <hi>Cadiz</hi> voyage, in bringing of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
cried out! <hi>Oh Ned Harwood, Ned Harwood, that I
had had thee heere.</hi> To the last Lord <hi>Steward,</hi> To the
old Earle of <hi>Southampton,</hi> To the late Earle of <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
To this now Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> And to the now
Earle of <hi>Leycester,</hi> who was sometime his Colonell;
To the Earle of <hi>Warwick,</hi> To the Lord <hi>Carleton,</hi> and
to most of the chiefe Nobilitie of this Kingdome.
Whose Letters found among his papers mention
such reall affection, as is scarcely credible, from men
of their quality. Neither was hee a little deare to
that highly honoured Lord, the Lord <hi>Craven</hi> (who
beside the late reall expression of love to his
Brother, and for his many, great, noble, and pious
workes, deserves to have his name written upon
pillers of brasse) who when hee heard of his death
(as was related to his brother,) cast himselfe on his
bed, cried out, hee had lost his Father, such was his
love and opinion of him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:63456:6"/>
Moreover, when his death was noised in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
there was such a generall lamentation for his
losse, that his Excellency was faine to send speciall
command to still it, least the enemy should take
courage, as thinking it were for some of greater qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
And his Excellency himselfe in my owne hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
I being appointed to goe before his Excellency
after the Hearse, heard him say, to Count <hi>Earnest, He
had lost his right hand, in the losse of Monsieur Harwood.</hi>
To bee briefe his name amongst Souldiours was,
<hi>In omniore, tanquam mel suavis est, &amp; tanquam instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta
musica in convivio lauto.</hi> Hee lived, desired; and
died, lamented.</p>
            <p>Hee soone ascended (in the States service) to the
highest step that <hi>Englishmen</hi> usually tread, &amp; that was
a Collonell; in which condition, I had my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of him: And these things my eye observed,
that Religion, fidelity, and prowesse so met in him,
that there seem'd a constant strife among them,
which should most appeare, and often shewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
together, by which hee brooke the back of
that Proverb: <hi>Nulla fides pietasque viris qui castra se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quuntur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first of these, shewed it selfe in attendance
upon the word, intimate acquaintance with, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
unto the faithfullest dispensours of it; The
exercise of his family therein; His purse standing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to the advancement of every worke of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> Hee gave a large summe
annually to the redeeming impropriations, the ruine
whereof was none of his least griefes, together with
the many soules that suffer by it; His conceipt was,
<pb facs="tcp:63456:6"/>
that nothing lesse then Atheisme and hellish malice
could blast it; Hee kept a diary of his inward man,
wherein hee wrot his owne slips, infirmities, and
Gods severall wayes of providence toward him,
which stood him in no small stead; He was very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in humiliations, and loved those dayes in his
life time, and to his death, being slaine in a publique
day of fasting; In all his actions, hee gave testimony,
that hee thought as much of dying, as of living. For
the second, hee was famous and precious to both the
Princes of <hi>Orange,</hi> in that respect.</p>
            <p>In the quelling the <hi>Arminian</hi> faction, hee alone
was trusted with a message to King <hi>Iames,</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his returne <hi>Barnevell,</hi> went to his last home. In the
leaguer of the <hi>Busse,</hi> hee had the charge of the <hi>Vello<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
when <hi>Picolominy</hi> was in the bowels of the Countrey
with 10000. men. His Excellency intrusting him
with the sole trust, mannaging and ordering of that
service, without limiting his commission, left it,
though a matter of maine concernment to his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and fidelity. In which service, hee watched
30. whole nights on Hor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eback, and never in that
time came in bed, and in conclusion by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and vigilancy discharged that great trust, and
fully secured the Countrey.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Cadiz</hi> voyage Wch was a matter of trust &amp; great
difficultie, hee had imposed on him the Charge of
bringing up the Reare, where the Enemie setting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
many scattered Troupes, hee brought them off
with safety, by an honourable Retreat. For want
of which at the Isle of <hi>Ree,</hi> how many brave Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
lost their lives, and our Nation, much of their
honour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:63456:7"/>
Lastly, his Valour was unstained, as all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
he was in, can beare large testimony thereof.
To be short, He was first hurt by a Granado in the
foot, at <hi>Mastrick</hi> (a sufficient warrant to have exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
him from the Service for that day) yet would
he not leave the prosecution of the designe, though
often disswaded and advised, of the great danger he
adventured, by the worthy Gentleman, Captaine
<hi>Skippon,</hi> now Serjeant Major Generall, for the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of <hi>London,</hi> but going often into the Trenches, to
view the Enemies Workes, in a Scarlet Coate, gave
the Enemy so faire a marke, that he received from
the wall, a sudden shot, out of a small Brasse Piece,
which strucke him through the heart, and was from
thence, by Command of the Prince of <hi>Orenge,</hi>
carryed to the <hi>Hague,</hi> where he was interred, with as
much honour, as ever was any that dyed in those
parts, of his quallitie. In fine, Thus much I must
say of him, He was true to his Principles, (a rare
vertue in this Age) Hee was neither above, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
his Calling, but very aeduquate and true un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it; So sad, serious, and skilfull in his way, that
you may doe well to beleeve what he writes. Hee
was a good man, a good Souldier, a good Christian,
and is now wearing his Crown. Much more I might
have said, but I must not make the Porch greater
then the Building, and therefore I conclude,</p>
            <lg>

            <head>COLLONELL
HARVVOODS advice to King
CHARLES.
OR,
A Discourse on the rumour of the French
Kings Preparation at Sea.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He particulars of his preparations not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
certainely knowne, there is no certain
judgement to be made of them; I will
therefore only take the case, as I suppose
it will be granted. That the French King endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to make himselfe strong at sea, and that by
two meanes, one encouraging his subjects to trade
at sea, giving his Merchants great priviledges, and
immunities, another of his owne proper cost, buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and building many great and good ships, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining
a yearely brave proportion out of his reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
for the increasing, and maintaining his Navie,
as some say 300. thousand l. sterling, others but 300.
thousand crownes, one or other, are considerable,
and may prove of danger to this state: For this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of his argues, that hee intends either to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into a new war, with his Majestie, or at least, to put
himselfe into such a condition, as when he shal thinke
<pb facs="tcp:63456:9"/>
fit, hee may doe so, without his disadvantage. That
this his Arming at sea, must be intended, in emulation
of His Majesties Lordship of the narrow Seas, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall,
ore-top him at sea is probable. For against
whom else? Not against the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> they are his
obsequious friends, desirous of his friendship, feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of his displeasure; not against the King of Spain,
for he can more easily invade him by land, when hee
will, as <hi>Spaine</hi> can him: Besides, the French King
shewes no disposition to enter into open warre with
him, for having taken on him the protection of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi>
and not well dealt with by him in the last trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for <hi>Italy,</hi> making a peace in shew, and yet after
taking his advantage, renuing the warre in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
name, yet doth he not enter into open war
with him, but will only be an assistant, else had it not
beene more facile for him to have invaded <hi>Flaunders,</hi>
or <hi>Artois,</hi> and so by diversion aided the Duke of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi>
then by sending an Army into <hi>Italy</hi> in the winter;
therefore this preparation of the French King, for
the sea, hath his chiefe ayme, in present, or future at
His Majestie. I suppose, not to invade <hi>England,</hi> or it
may be none of His Majesties Ilands, though that is
more then we can be assured of: some of his ships
of warre were this winter on His Majesties coast,
went from Harbour to Harbour, doubtlesse to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
them, and not for any good to His Majestie:
besides, who cantell, since the Ilands of <hi>Garnesey,</hi>
and <hi>Iersey,</hi> are the only remainders of the large Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
His Majesties Predecessors formerly have
possessed in <hi>France,</hi> if hee have not an itching to
joyne them to <hi>France</hi> againe, or if not them, nor
<pb facs="tcp:63456:9"/>
               <hi>Wight;</hi> yet to share the dominion of the narrow
Seas with His Majestie, and that is to take it from
him, if he can; to which hitherto hee hath not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
as not being able to match His Majestie at
Sea, but if he continue these His preparations, and
that His Majestie out of hand prepare not also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, hee will in short time undoubtedly effect
it. It will be said (it may be) hee hath no good ports
or havens? that is an errour; it is true, he hath not so
many good harbours, as His Majesty hath, yet some
he hath, not inferiour to any of His Majesties, it may
be also said that his Subjects are not so proper for the
Sea, nor so affected to Trade, as his Majesties are: it
is true, but if he continue to encourage his Merchants,
turne Merchant himselfe, will not his Princes, great
Lords, and Gentlemen, follow his example? For
Saylors, if he give great pay, and pay well, he will
not want them of other Nations; nay, if his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
owne Subjects have not the like great and good
payment, it is to be feared, he may draw many of
his, to his service, at first, untill there be open warres
twixt the Kingdomes: for doe not, at this present,
many hundreds, I might say, thousands of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Subjects, serve other States at Sea; as the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,
nay, the Turkes, without either leave, or
knowledge of his Majestie.</p>
            <p>Now, if the French King should come to bee as
powerfull, or more, then his Majestie at Sea, he will
be a more dangerous and fearfull neighbour to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
then <hi>Spaine,</hi> whom hitherto this Kingdom have
of latter yeares onely had cause to feare, for that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Spaine,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> will ever bee a good
<pb facs="tcp:63456:10"/>
Bulwarck; who if the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> at any time,
make any great preparations at Sea, will be ever jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
it is intended 'gainst them, and so ever arme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, and be alwaies ready to joyne with, and
to assist his Majestie 'gainst <hi>Spaine,</hi> which may bee
doubted, they will not so readily doe against <hi>France,</hi>
with whom they are in league, and not jealous off.
Besides the King of Spaine hath not so populous a
Countrey, as hee can easily prepare, either a great
Fleet, or Land Army, and much lesse both, without
long time, and so his Majestie may have the more
warning thereof; Then <hi>Spaine</hi> is further from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and so the journey is the longer, and from thence
cannot come many Horse, which are the forces most
to be feared in <hi>England.</hi> Whereas <hi>France</hi> being so
neere us, and so full of Souldiers, both Horse and
Foot, if it once come to be able to equall <hi>England</hi> at
Sea, by sudden and quicke preparations, stealing op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,
he may oretop <hi>England</hi> at Sea, and then
transport such an Army of Horse and Foot, as
we might justly be afraid of: For old Souldiers both
Horse and Foot, <hi>France</hi> abounds in, and the <hi>French</hi>
have a vertue proper to them, that not a Gentleman
thinkes himselfe any thing, untill he have seene the
Warres, learned at least, good and perfect use of his
Armes, and naturally they are all good Horsemen;
their Land affords Horses fit for service, and every
man almost knows to use Pistoll and Carabin: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in <hi>England,</hi> unlesse those, which have beene Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
few or none can use their Armes, and of those
which have bin Souldiers, it may be not all, can well
use their Armes; especially the Musquet, which is of
most offence, which our Nation are not naturally so
<pb facs="tcp:63456:10"/>
prompt to learn the use of, as the <hi>French</hi> are; and for
Horse, this Kingdom is so deficient, as it is a question,
whether or not, the whole Kingdome could make
2000. good Horse, that might equall 2000. <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To redesse these deficiences, In all humility, I here
present my poore and slender advice, under correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and with submission to better judgments.</p>
            <p>First, and principally I would advise that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
would arme at Sea, for that is the surest defence,
for we can never be hurt by a forraigne enemy, by
land, till we be first beaten at Sea; and therein
I cannot give better advise, then to doe what the
French King doth, as to repaire and increase his own
Royall Navie, which is the greatest and best assured
strength of <hi>England,</hi> and to that end, to set apart
some certaine large proportion of his revenue, that
His Sea-men may have good pay, and well paid;
and if there be good and strict courses taken, that
there be no abuses in the Musters, victualling, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of Ammunition (which without good
payment cannot well be executed) His Majesty will
be a Gainer thereby, in matter of profit, besides,
the reputation and advantage of his service; and
it is my opinion, that no Prince nor State, but had
better give 40 in the hundred, for monies to pay his
<hi>Militia</hi> well, then not to pay well: Then to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
his Merchants, and other subjects to trade, and
in making new plantations. For his land-forces,
that His Majestie would take order, that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of trayned men were increased, or rather that
the whole Kingdome from 18. or 20. to 35. or 40.
as many men as were able of bodies were armed, one
<pb facs="tcp:63456:11"/>
third with pikes, and armours, another with mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,
and the third with calivers; that there were
powder, bullets, and match through the whole
Kingdome, magazines thereof in suncry places of
the Kingdome in such a quantity, as if it were inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in one, or divers parts, there be no want of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition
in any place: for it would be then too late
to fetch it else-where, and much worse, then to make
it, or send over Seas for it. That there were care ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
that these men then armed might be well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised;
and to that end, that there be in every hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth,
or wapentake, some old souldier, Sergeant,
or other inferiour Officer, had out of the Low-countries
well chosen, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at might teach men the use
of their Armes, and that there were certaine dayes
set and appointed, for the shewing their Armes, and
exercising them: and if the Statutes which were
formerly for sporting in the Long Bow, were revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
or converted, (with deliberation) for the mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
and Caliver, to practise by shooting at markes
on ordinary Holy-dayes, and such like times, and at
some time some small prize for them, that shoot nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest;
under correction, I thinke it were much
for the strength of the Kingdome: Then that
there were good choyse made of the Mustermasters,
none to be but such as had borne office in some actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
warre of reputation; for better there were none,
and their allowances divi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed unto sundry inferiour
men, then for one to draw a great pay, that either
knowes not to doe, or doth not any thing for it: and
because there is, or may be such as have borne office
<pb facs="tcp:63456:11"/>
in the warres, and yet discontinue so long, as they
have forgotten their trade, or that the fashion of the
warres and exercising bee changed, since hee was
last a souldiour, that every Mustermaster, shall not
onely at his first enterance, bee approved by such as
are able to judge him, to bee fit for that charge, but
to the end hee may continue so, hee bee injoyned
once, in 4 or 5. yeares, to goe personally for the
Sommer time into some actuall warre abroad, if
any bee, to retaine and renew his knowledge, That
the Captaines of the Trained bands, bee injoyned
themselves to passe the Seas, to learne the duties of
their places, or at least, to keepe of his owne charge,
one that can discharge his place, and if neither to
quite their commands to such, as will doe the one
or other.</p>
            <p>By this meanes, his Majesty may have an Army
of foot on a sodaine in any part of <hi>England</hi> to answer
all occasions, without drawing his forces much
farre out of their proper Countries; for an Enemy
may make shew of landing in one place, and having
drawen the greatest strength of the Kingdome thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(windes serving for it) sodainly transport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to another, before that Army can by land
come there.</p>
            <p>Now for horse, wherein this Kingdome is more
defective, then I thinke is any other, it were a worke
worthy of his Majesty, seriously to take it into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
how to amed it, and though on a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine,
it is not to bee hoped to bring the worke to
any great perfection, yet a good foundation once
well layed, in processe of time, it may bee effected,
<pb facs="tcp:63456:12"/>
and for the present bee much helped: it is so great a
worke, and my experience being not so much that
way as in foote, I will not take upon mee to deliver
any certaine grounds for it, but will onely point at
some wayes, whereby I conceive it may bee refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
The defects consists chiefely in want of fit
horses, and fit men to bee horse-men, which I take
to bee the greater want of the two, and can but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that so great a kingdome should bee so defective
in so brave and noble a strength, wherein our nearest
neighbours so abound; in ancient times wee were
not so, it may bee one reason is, that now our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is more addicted to running and hunting horses,
then in those elder times.</p>
            <p>For remedy, under correction, First, that there
where care taken, that there were a stronger breed
of horses through the Kingdome; then that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
would beginne at his Court, and there convert
his bands of Pensioners into a brave troupe of <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rassers,</hi>
there horses at least so ready, as to give and
change a pistoll on, sometimes to exercise them, by
shooting at a marke on horseback with their pistols,
and alwayes to keepe this band so. To admit none
to those places, but such as before, were knowen to
bee horsemen, and could use pistoll on horseback:
Then that the Lords, &amp; others of his Majesties great
Officers, and Councell, did follow this example, and
every one to keep some great horses, to have armes,
and pistols, and some such Servants as were fit to
bee horsemen, and to induce other Lords, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of great estates, to doe to like, and incourage
them thereto; to reserve all personall honours (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb facs="tcp:63456:12"/>
experienced souldiers that had born good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand)
for such Noblemen, and Gentlemen as did
in this conforme themselves to doe his Majesty and
Countrey service, whereby those, which never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to make the warres their trade, might bee
brought so farre as to be enabled to doe something
for the defence of their King and Countrey: if the
Noblemen and Gentlemen would take this to heart,
as they have done, running of races for bels (which
I could wish, were converted to shooting at a marke
with pistols on horseback for the same bell;) they
would bee sufficient for Curassiers. Now for other
kinds of horse, I would that the Trained bands were
increased, and all reformed to Harquebusiers, but
whether their Peeces to bee with Fire-locks or
Snaphaunces, is questionable, the Fire-lock is more
certaine for giving fire, the other more facile for
use. For the present my opinion is, at first, it were
best to take up the Snaphaunce, untill Pistols be
more frequent, which being more difficult to use,
are fittest as before for Gentlemen to begin first to
bring into use: When they have once brought them
to be ordinary, it will be more facile to bring them
into use amongst the inferiour sort; and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
this Kingdome hath not (except in <hi>London,</hi> and
it may bee some few Townes besides) Artificers,
that can make or amend fire-locks: Then I would
have a Muster-master a part, for the horse, as well as
for the foote, well choosen, some old Horseman
out of the <hi>Low-countries;</hi> For that it is scarce possible
to find men that are fit and able for both horse and
foote: The Kingdome thus armed and exercised
<pb facs="tcp:63456:13"/>
an Enemy cannot land in any part of it, but, (without
unturnishing the other parts,) there will bee a
competent Army presently found to make resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
            <p>It may bee said, these Advises will be found not
practiquable, or very difficultly; so are all great
workes at first; but I conceive, if his Majesty would
take it to heart, and give incouragements of honour
and preferrements, to such as conforme themselves
to his pleasure herein, and make this the way of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement,
it would not bee difficult, but if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this way honour and advancement may bee had;
well may many thinke, why should they take such
pains, or be at such charge, for that which may more
easily bee had: And here I cannot but blame our
Nation in the generall, (for I beleeve, the most
gloriousest of our neighbours, will grant, it as Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
a Nation, as is on the Earth,) that they should
not bee more addicted to Armes, but give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for the most, to expensefull pleasures, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unserviceable for King and Countrey: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
there is not a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman, that so soone as
hee begins to write man, but learnes to ride, to use
his armes on foote and horseback, and whether
younger or elder brother, puts himselfe into some
actuall warre for some time, to learne the trade of
a souldier, though hee never intend to make it his
profession. I would further advise, that all the
principall Harbours &amp; good landing places were so
fortified, as farre as is possible, that no Enemies Fleet
should anchour in them, or much lesse land in them,
without remarkeable disadvantage. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb facs="tcp:63456:13"/>
of which places I would have given to none,
but experienced souldiers, and such, as are sound in
Religion, and had borne commands in the warres
for many yeares; and they to reside in them: not
unto Noblemen, or Gentlemen of great estates,
which seldome, or never, come at them; and much
lesse to meaner men that are no souldiers: for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
whereof the charge once <hi>arrested,</hi> to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partite</hi>
them on some revenue neere adjoyning, and
being well paid, to have strict oversight had, that
there bee alwayes such, and so many able Gunners
and Souldiers present in them, as his Majesty payes,
on all occasions to bee used; if lesse will serve,
then why should his Majesty bee charged to pay
more.</p>
            <p>To conclude, if his Majesty would reserve the
places properly belonging to the warres, (whereof
hee hath the fewest of any great Prince of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome;)
as, the Governments of his Ilands, the
keeping of the Forts, and Castles, and places of
command in Zeeland, onely for souldiers, and
worthy souldiers, and men sound in Religion.
It would bee a great incouragement to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to follow the warres, to inable themselves
to doe him service, though to their cost and
charge, when they have to hope, that though they
serve a strange Prince, or State to their no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
yet thereby inabling themselves to doe their
owne King service, they may in time bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for in their owne Countrey; whereas if
charges of commands, advancements of honour
may bee had better cheape, by staying at home

            <head>THE LATE EARLE
OF
ESSEX
His Instructions for Englands
SAFETIE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter I had resolved to publish this <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript</hi>
of my Brothers, I remembred
I had read something, long since, in a
little Treatise, written by that brave
and worthy Commander, the late Earle
of <hi>Essex,</hi> concerning Sea Preparations (though then
written in a time when we had an open Enemie, and
now no such occasion, yet we know not how soone
we may,) Which though but short, yet my Brothers
judgement concurring with it, which was, that the
safest and surest defence for this Kingdome, was our
Navy, and that we could never be hurt by Land, by
a Forreigne enemy, unlesse we were first beaten at
Sea. I thought it not amisse, to annex it to this of my
Brothers, and by that occasion, reading the whole
Discourse from which I had it. I found in it besides,
what concernes this point, which was Directions for
the securing of this Kingdome, some such worthy
<pb facs="tcp:63456:16"/>
expressions, which as they did much affect me in the
reading, so I conceive, they might be of some use al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
for these times; as some for imitation, others, for
other purposes. I thought it not amisse to revive, and
bring them againe to light; some things were spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by that brave Lord of himselfe, some others are
related by him of those Ancient and renowned Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
where we may see a bravenesse of spirit, even
in those that were but Heathen. Now if there were
such brave spirits in them that had nothing but the
light of nature to direct them: What should be then
in Christians that have a Sunne to their Candle, Shal
they come short of them, in love and affection to their
Countrey? Will it not one day rise up in judgement
against us, as our Saviour saith of <hi>Tirus</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi>
that haue such principles, and such encouragements of
rewards above them. They had but honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
I may say, a vaine and windy motive: We
have the Command of God, and a heavenly reward
promised, even a Kingdome, and that everlasting;
and shall we come so short of them, as not to venture
anything for God, his Gospel, and our Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Did a Roman say, he cared not to leave to bury him,
so the Common-wealth might flourish? What shall
a Christian doe for his Countrey? shall he not lay
aside all private respects of his owne, and only seeke
Gods honour, in his care of the Common good.</p>
            <p>Now most noble Lords, and Gentlemen, God
having called you unto it. Let your Countrey see,
and all the World know, that there is more power in
Religion, then in Heathenish Principles; Ioyne all
your forces together to promote his Gospell, and
<pb facs="tcp:63456:16"/>
your Countreyes good.</p>
            <p>O that the reviving of these few sparks that I have
by this occasion brought to light, might adde fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to your brave English Spirits; What though
there be some so degenerate, as to raise their fortunes
and keepe their honours, cares not what becomes of
the Common-wealth, and Gospell of Christ; Yet we
have found there are many, yea many, that still retain
that ancient vertue in them, and doe even at this time
practise it; to such I will say, goe one Noble Lords
and Gentlemen, doe worthily in <hi>Bethelem,</hi> and you
shall be famous in <hi>Ephrata,</hi> set aside all private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
and as you have begun with unwearied
paines and patience (which in all due thankefulnesse
we doe humbly acknowledge) Goe on still to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
your care of us, and our Countries good, and
for all others contrarily minded, the Lord either
convert them, or suddenly confound them.</p>
            <p>In this ensuing relation, I shall onely use that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Lords owne words. I leave their applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to all true-hearted English-men. The heads are
these,</p>
            <p>First, His advice for Sea Preparations, which are
not (as I conceive) un-usefull for this present time.</p>
            <p>Secondly, his Protestation of his affection to his
Country, worthy the imitation of men of his quality.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, his extraordinary affection to Souldiers
and men of Warre, the favouring and cherishing of
whom, will be no small security to this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, his Iudgement concerning Pluralities of
Religion, tollerated in a State, A thing worthy of due
consideration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:63456:17"/>
Fiftly, the sweet harmony betwixt a loving
Prince, and loyall subjects, a desireable and imitable
thing. Lastly, a sweet reprehension of the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
expence of these times, which if some course
were taken therein to limit them: I see not, but it
would make much to the generall good of this
Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>First, for his advise for Sea-preparations, it was
this, that if Her Majestie would be pleased, but to
raise up a summe of a hundred, and fifty thousand
pounds a yeare; and put it into the hands of an honest
and sufficient Treasurer, for the warres, and to bee
issued by a Councell well chosen, would fully and
sufficiently maintaine the warre with <hi>Spaine;</hi> yea,
such a force should be maintained thereby, as Her
Maiesty having a convenient number of her owne
ships, and repairing and furnishing them, as yearely
she doth, the enemy should bring no Fleet into the
Seas for <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> or <hi>Low-countries,</hi> but
should be beaten, nor seeke to gather one into <hi>Spain,</hi>
but the parts of it should be defeated, before the
whole could be assembled, yea, those services
should bee done upon the enemy, that the poorest
Prince or State in Christendome, should have little
cause to feare his malice.</p>
            <p>2. For his Protestation of his affection to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
it was, that the reputation of a most faithful sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and zealous Patriot, with the hazard of his life,
and decay of his estate he had sought to purchase, and
when he was offered by the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> what
Tittle, summe of money, or pension he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
so as hee might be won to take their part, hee did
<pb facs="tcp:63456:17"/>
professe, that if God had not put him back, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested
him by contrary winds and tempests that
summer, he would have taught that proud King, what
effects his proffer had wrought in him, and the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
the will of God, and his Soveraigne did restraine
him, with the greater interest to hope to pay him in
the end, that had sought him out as a fit man to
betray his Queene and Countrey.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, for his respect to Souldiers, and men of
warre, hee profest he did intirely love them. First,
for his owne sake; for hee found sweetnesse in their
conversations, strong assistance in their imploiments
with him, and happinesse in their friend-ship: that
he loved them for their vertues sake, and for their
greatnesse of mind (for little minds, though never
so full of vertue, can be but little vertuous) and for
their great understanding, for to understand little
things, or things not of use, is little better then to
understand nothing at all; That he loved them for
their affections; for selfe-loving men, love ease, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and profit, but they that love paines, danger,
and paine, shew that they love publick profit, more
then themselves: That he loved them for his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
sake, for they are <hi>Englands</hi> best Armour of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and weapons of offence, if we have peace,
they have purchased it; if we should have warre,
they must mannage it; Yea, while we are doubtfull,
and in treaties, wee must value our selves by what
may be done, and the enemy will value us by that
which hath beene done by our chiefe men of action.
Before action, providence made him cherrish them
for the service they can doe, and after action, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
<pb facs="tcp:63456:18"/>
and thankfulnesse made him love them for
the service they had done.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, concerning Plurality of Religion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
in one Estate, that it was against the policy of
all States; because where there is no unity, or order
in the State, it is the manifest ruine of that State; for
as the mingling of poyson with wholesome liquor
in one vessell, doth not correct that which is Lethal,
but corrupts that which is wholesome: so the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
doctrine of those <hi>Hispanioliz'd</hi> Iesuites once
brought in that state, will not indure any profession
(save their owne.)</p>
            <p>Fiftly, for the sweet harmony, betwixt a loving
Prince, and loyall subjects: Thus doth he say, wee,
thankes be to God, have a Queene, who hath never
beene wastfull in her private expence; yet will shee
sell her plate, and jewels in the Tower, ere her peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
shall be undefended: We are a people that will
turne our silken coats into iron Iacks, and our silver
plate into coats of plate, rather then our Soveraign
shall be unserved.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, and lastly, his pleasing reprehension of the
superfluous expences of those times, it is by way of
objection that was made in those times; that they
could neither have a good peace, or jnst warre; and
of two evils, it were better to have a patched peace,
then an unsupportable warre. To which he answers,
that those that did so thinke were injurious; First to
our men of warre (that fight for them, and defend
them) in thinking their armes (which have ever done
honour to our nation, and stricken terrour into the
<pb facs="tcp:63456:18"/>
hearts of our enemies) lesse able to defend our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
then their treaties, which have never beene
free from scorne and disadvantage. Injurious they
are to the Countrey that bred them, which being one
of the bravest, strongest, and happiest States in
Christendome, is judged by these men, to be as weak
as their owne weake hearts. Injurious they are to
her Majestie, who being so great, so glorious, and so
victorious a Queene, shall be judged unable to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
warre, when she cannot have peace, but at the
pleasure of her enemie. Yea, injurious, and most
unthankfull they are to God himselfe (who hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
fought for them) in that (for an unsafe peace,
with an idolatrous, and irrelegious nation) they
would leave an honourable, and just warre. But
when some objections might bee made, that Her
Majesties Treasure was drawne deepe into, and if
there were any weaknesse in our meanes, to make
warre, it was in our Treasure: To this he answers,
that though Her Majesties treasure be drawne deep
into, and the poore Hus-bandman by the late hard
yeares past, hath now left scarce any meanes to live;
yet if our sumptuous buildings, our surfetting diet,
our Prodigality in Garments, our infinite Place, and
costly Furniture of our houses, be well considered,
<hi>England</hi> cannot be thought poore: can we exceed all
nations in Christendome in wastfull vanities, and
can we not arme our selves against one nation (whom
wee have ever beaten) for our necessary defence?
Was <hi>Rome</hi> so brave a State, that the very Ladies
to supply the common Treasure, and to maintaine
<pb facs="tcp:63456:19"/>
the warres, spoyled themselves of their Iewels, and
rich ornaments, and is <hi>England</hi> so base a State, as
that the people therein, will not bestow some part
of their superfluous expences, to keepe themselves
from conquest, and slavery? Did the godly Kings
and religious people, which wee read of in the old
Testament, to maintaine warre, against the enemies
of God, sell the ornaments of the Temple, and the
things consecrated to holy uses? and shall not wee
that have as holy a warre spare those things we have
dedicated to our owne idle, and sensuall pleasures?
Could our owne nation in those gallant former a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
when our countrey was farre poorer, then now
it is, levy armies, maintaine warres, atchieve great
conquests in <hi>France,</hi> and make our powerfull Armies
knowne, as farre as the Holy-Land? And is this
such a degenerate age, as wee shall not be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<hi>England;</hi> no, no, there is yet left some seed of
that ancient vertue. I remember with what spirit
and alacrity, the Gentlemen of England have put
themselves voluntarily into our late actions; there
wil ever be found some valorous, which (so the State
may stand) and flourish care not though they leave
not, wherewith to bury themselves: though others
bury their money, not caring in what case they
leave the state.</p>
            <div type="conclusion">
               <head>The Conclusion.</head>
               <p>THus farre are his owne words, and here I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to have finished this discourse, but my
thoughts prest me to a new taske, and what shall I
<pb facs="tcp:63456:19"/>
say most Noble Lords, and worthy Gentlemen, I
will say to you even as <hi>Abraham</hi> did to God; Seeing,
saith hee: I have begunne to speake unto my Lord,
that am but dust and ashes, <hi>Let not my Lord bee angry,
I will speake but this once.</hi> Seeing, I have taken upon
mee to publish something, that I hope, may tend to
the good of our bodies; give mee leave now to adde
something, (which I hope) may bee no lesse for the
good of soules, and that is this, most Humbly to
crave, that you will bee pleased to take to your
most wise and grave considerations, that noble and
pious worke happily begunne and successefully
proceeded in, of the Feoffees for redeeming in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations,
of which body before it was supprest,
I was (though unworthy) a member, and therefore
can say the more, of which I dare bee bould to say,
it was one of the most glorious workes that ever
was undertaken in this Kingdome of late yeares, and
did more conduce to the spreading abroad of the
glorious Gospell of IESVS CHRIST, then any
I ever understood of, or heard of. Of which I may
truly say, as <hi>Solomon</hi> of the vertuous Huswife, to
those that did contribute to it <hi>Many Daughters have
done vertuously, but thou surmounts them all.</hi> I deny not,
but it is good to give to Hospitals, to repairing of
Churches, setting up of Free-Schooles, building of
Almes-houses and the like; But I have ever thought
such as concerne soules, to bee as farre above them,
as the soule is above the body.</p>
               <p>This Pious Worke it was well approved by his
Majesty, as we were informed, at our first taking of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t; And I am sure of all the best Subjects, onely the
<pb facs="tcp:63456:20"/>
                  <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> speakes of, (<hi>That love Prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence,
and thrust their Brethren out of the Church</hi>)
the Prelates of our time, that never did further, but
ever hinder any good Worke that tended to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of the Gospell of Christ, if it did not
Comply with their ambitions. But of them I will
say no more, (you have said so much, and so wel.)
But for this Pious worke I dare be bound to say, if
it had continued, and not beene supprest, by their
meanes, That by this time most of the Impropriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of this Kingdome had beene brought in, and laid
unto the Church againe. A worke fit for such an
Age as this, that hath enjoyed the Gospell so long,
to have propagated it to the darke corners of this
Kingdome, and this to be effected and done, not by a
forced and strained exaction, but by a free and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
contribution of such as understand the nature
of it, and saw the present good fruits and effect of
it, which adde much to the glory of it. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions
at first were very incouraging, and some
underwrit yearely good summes, others to every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation
we brought certaine summes; but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the time of our unhappy dissolution the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution
grew much greater; for, not a weeke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we were supprest, a Lady, yet living, sent us
word, shee would give a thousand pounds presently
to the furtherance of the Worke, and many wills
have since beene altered that we heard off, that gave
brave proportions to it. I never heard of, nor can yet
see any such way to spread the Gospell to the remote
and blind corners of this Kingdome, neither can we,
for ought I know, ever hope to see Popery quelled,
<pb facs="tcp:63456:20"/>
till a godly painfull Ministry be established, and that
will never be, till competent meanes bee provided:
both these had been effected, and the effects in time,
would have manifested what I have said, and the
benefit thereof would not onely have extended to
the Church, but also to the Common-wealth; for
where a good Ministery is placed in a Towne, there
idlenesse will be abolished, the poore and impotent
children, and vagrant set on worke, and His Majesty
have gained true and loyall Subjects, such as he may
repose himselfe in their loves and fidelities. Its the
glory of our Religion, it was never stained with
those hellish Plots, Massacres, and Treacheries against
their Soveraigne; and if ever Popery bee put downe
to purpose, it must be by the meanes of establishment
of a powerfull Ministry; then shall we see Satan fall
downe like Lightning, It must be the breath of the
Lord that must abolish the man of Sinne. I deny not
but good Lawes doe well, but what through favour,
conniving, and want of execution, we dayly see they
have not such good effect, as were to be wished: that
I am confident, it must be the powerfull consciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Preaching Ministery of the Gospell, that must
especially effect it, and to procure that, nothing wil
more conduce, then a full, free, and plentifull provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for the Dispencers of it, and not for such as doe
least to have most. The Lord in mercy direct you,
blesse and prosper your proceedings, and in his good
time, give us to enjoy the happy fruits and effects of
your great, long, and unwearied Paines.</p>
