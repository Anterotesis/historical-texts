         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A Paper of lyes and ſlanders I have lately ſeen of John
Harwoods with his name at it, which he calls A true and real
Demonſtration why he denyed the Authority of George Fox,
which truly the lyes and the ſlanders are ſo manifeſt falſe reports,
that he hath gathered up, to all men that he hath directed his Book
to, conſidering the unclean actions of the perſon, which are out of and
below civil men, may convince all what a kind of perſon he hath been
for ſeveral years, which is not like that ſuch an unclean ſpirit that
runs into ſuch unclean actions that came into the open view of the
world, when he would have taken away a womans life, and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
his, about uncleanneſs, in the face of a Country, and in the ſight
of the world; and they that believe ſuch untrue Narrations, are
the ſame unclean ſpirits of his, whoſe actions, practice, carriage, have
been ſuch which are a ſhame for modeſty to mention, and he ſo
loathſome and unclean, not fit to come among ſober people, and is not
worth the heeding what he ſaith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſomthing is written to his paper, that none of the ſimple might
be deceived that knows him not, nor his carriage, nor his practice,
who hath diſhonoured God, and his people, and gone into thoſe things,
which are out of the bounds of civil men, ſuch an unclean ſpirit, the
unclean ſpirits may cry up ſuch an unclean ſpirit to be their teacher.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>JOHN HARWOOD, firſt, thou ſayeſt <hi>The truth of God among
friends thou never didſt d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſown.</hi> Oh impudencie that thou ſhouldſt
be ſo impudent! didſt thou own the truth of God amongſt Friends
when thou acted thy uncleanneſs? Thy word is never, I never dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned,
ſayſt thou, but in the fear of the pure God, I declare it;
waſt thou in the fear of God, when thou runs into uncleanneſs? did
not thy fruits manifeſt quite contrary at the Seſſions, that thy pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
denyed both God &amp; his people? Was it not time to turn thee
out from the Aſſembly of the righteous, when thou hadſt turned thy
ſelf from the life and truth: the life turned thee out; now thou
makes a noyſe amongſt ſome like unto thy ſelf: And did not thou
diſhonour God and his teſtimony, and Chriſt and his righteouſneſs,
when thou went into ſuch unrighteous actions? and then when thou
hadſt done thou runs reviling and ſlandering, and ſcandaling and
ſcribling againſt friends, when they could not own thee in thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
actions, who never went to the Juſtice, nor to the Seſſions,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45283:3"/>
to clear truth; &amp; confeſs to them thy abominable actions, how thou
hadſt diſhonoured God and his truth, and owned thy condemnation
amongſt them, and how thou had abuſed his truth.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou charges <hi>G. F. of Capital offences,</hi> which are
offences unto death by thy unclean ſpirits judgment, and there thou
poureſts out thy envy and malice, which no other fruit can be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from thee, but it will fall upon thine own head, &amp; whoever joyns
with thee in this work, they will fall with thee in the ſame pit.</p>
            <p>And thou goeſt about to clear thy ſelf from prejudice and enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and fathers thy lies and ſlanders upon God: Oh blaſphemy,
wickedneſs and impudency!</p>
            <p>And thou ſayſt, <hi>G. F. hath been ſearching after the failings and
offences of others to publiſh them.</hi> This is one of thy lyes. But where
the offences and failings are, and a changing from them, and the
people forſake their offences and failings, that is owned, and that
no uncleanneſs might be amongſt us, nor enter into the Camp; if
there be any, we ſearch that we may find it out. But in this thou
haſt made thy ſelf manifeſt, that would not have offences and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
judged, for he that ſins openly is to be reproved openly.</p>
            <p>And thou ſayeſt <hi>The publication of theſe things</hi> (of thy lyes &amp;
ſlanders and falſe reports) <hi>is at the juſt hand of God and mine.</hi> Thus
thou impudently and blaſphemouſly joyns thy ſelf with God in
publiſhing thy lyes and ſlanders.</p>
            <p>And firſt thou ſayeſt, <hi>G. F. calls himſelf the Son of God,</hi> &amp;c. And
this thou calls a crime; thy actions and fruits hath manifeſted whoſe
ſon thou art, and thy ſelf to be ignorant of the Scriptures and the
Spirit that gave them forth. And as for the eſteem of thee, it was
never much valued, though <hi>G. F.</hi> &amp; many other friends, did exhort
thee, that thou might have been preſerved, as a civil man, &amp; been
kept out of theſe things, which were below many of the World.</p>
            <p>Another of thy lyes, <hi>That G. F. ſhould ſet up himſelf in the high
place, and throw down others.</hi> This is another of thy lyes, for it is
the Lord that ſet him up, and not man, and ſuch wicked unclean
ſpirits as thine is, he doth not own, and ſuch unclean ſpirits as thou
art, are not Gods inheritance; for I do Judge and am above all
ſuch, and ever was, and ever ſhall be. And ſo thou art one fallen
into the divers temptations, and hurtful luſts, but thy heart is given
up to the ſame which is come up to open view.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:45283:3"/>
And what ado haſt thou to talk of God, and his divine glory
and his truth, and his people, whoſe fruit hath manifeſted the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe
of thy ſpirit. What ado haſt thou to take Gods name
in thy mouth, that hates to be reformed? For <hi>Korah</hi> when he
gainſayed <hi>Moſes,</hi> he gainſayed the Law, when he went from truth;
and ſuch inſtruments as thou art, haſt diſhonoured the Lord, more
then ever thou haſt honoured him, and his people, and his truth
and therefore thou rageſt againſt them that have lived in it, and
have kept their garments clean. And ſuch as thou art ſaid Chriſt
was a Devil, though they could find no ſeam in his Garment.</p>
            <p>And what doſt thou talk of <hi>Iſrael</hi> who haſt gone from that which
did convince thee, and now become a railer, and falſe accuſer, and
impudent? and thou haſt been led into open prophaneſs, which God
brought to light, that the very earth could not bear thee, but judge
thee; and therefore doſt thou think that his people would receive
thee? Thou art far off from the fellowſhip of them; if thou hadſt
intended to have got in amongſt the fellowſhip of the Saints in
light, and the heirs of the Goſpel whoſe Converſation is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
thy way had been to have gone to the Magiſtrates, and the
Seſſions, and the Countrey, and have preached thy Condemnation
for ſuch things, in which thou hadſt run out beyond modeſty to
ſpeak of; and I know none but thee, and ſuch as thy ſpirit are, to
uſurp over the Conſciences of people, and enthrone themſelves
with thy unclean ſpirit, who hath long burdened the righteous ſeed
But it is riſen and will eaſe it ſelf, and ſhake you off, like duſt and
chaffe, and brambles for the fire.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſpeakeſt of <hi>Legal Preſcriptions, and to enjoyn
to the performance of external forms and practices.</hi> This is thy ſelf,
and <hi>I.P.</hi> that man thou exalts ſo, which preſcriptions and External
Forms we judge, and therefore ye rage, and God hath abaſed, and
will abaſe, and your end is ſeen and manifeſted; and thou goeſt
and pretends to teach others, and cannot keep thy ſelf as a man,
and thou pretends ſo much peace and love, and manifeſts ſo much
envy as thou uttereſt in thy paper.</p>
            <p>And thou ſpeaks of <hi>G. F. to clear himſelf if he can amongſt
friends,</hi> and he is clear among true friends. Thou art denyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
all true friends, thou haſt nothing to do to come amongſt
them: and before thou ſaidſt it was a true and real demonſtration.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45283:4"/>
And ſo then if he can clear himſelf (thou ſaiſt); here thou queſtions
my own work againe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou ſaiſt that</hi> G. F. ſent a paper with his own hand to it to ſeveral
Churches, into ſeveral Countreys for friends to nominate and appoint
ſuch as were eſteemed, that they might ſit in the place of Magiſtracy,
and to ſend their names to London to be preſented to the preſent Power
to be Comm<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſionated by them. <hi>Thou ſaiſt,</hi> This may truly ſignifie
that I had an end to my ſelf, to exalt my ſelf in the Government of the
Nation, in getting up them to ſit in Juſtice, and I would ſet my ſelf
over them, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>There is not a word of this true, for I was not in <hi>London</hi> when
the paper was ſent, neither was it ordered by me, neither ſent out
by me, neither was I at <hi>London</hi> till after it was ſent forth, neither
did I know of the paper till after it was ſent forth. And thus thou
and all people may ſee thy wickedneſs and envy; and the intent
of the paper, as friends told me, which I beleeve and know it was
the time of great ſufferings and perſecution; when ſufferings were
laid before the Parliament, they told they knew not how to remedy
it, and they told friends that they might nominate ſome ſober men
in the Countrey that would not perſecute them, and to have them
ſent up to the Parliament, and this was the intent of friends ſending
down that paper which thou malitiouſly makes uſe of, in rendring
friends odious, and me to be the Author of it, who knew not that
it was forth, till it was forth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thou ſaiſt,</hi> A Letter went forth in G. F's. name, with his
hand at it, for all that had been Souldiers and Officers in the Army,
that had been put forth upon the account of truth, they might ſend up
their names to London, to be preſented to the preſent Power, that they
might be reſtored into their reſpective places, and there were many
among them that could not take up a carnal ſword; and ſo ſee where
this man would have led theſe people; if he had accompliſhed this thing,
friends had been found in actual Armes at this Powers coming in,
it might have cauſed ruine and deſtruction of many of the innocent:
and this is clearly evident of his uſurping the external Government.</p>
            <p>This is altogether falſe, and proceeds from an envious, malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
lying ſpirit, and a blood-thirſty ſpirit, the ſame that acted
uncleanneſſe with a woman, and then would have hanged her, and
her thee, for which cauſe thou waſt denyed, and art denyed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:45283:4"/>
But as for a Paper given forth for the ſouldiers giving in their
names, which we had many, and others we had not which were
written to, to lay them with others ſufferings before the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but not for them to go into their places again, and to take
Government, that was utterly denyed, and to bear arms again,
that was never in my heart, neither do I believe it was in their
hearts, when that, that thing was laid upon many of them, and was
invited to go to take up arms again into their places, but never
intended by me nor them, as I ſaid before; and this lye and ſlander
thou haſt uttered forth to manifeſt thy wickedneſſe, and further
thy malicious ſpirit.</p>
            <p>And as for <hi>John Hall,</hi> what was writ unto him in a private pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
it was from the womans own mouth; and therefore thou
ſhouldeſt have judged thine own wickedneſſe, for that concerned
thee, and ſo it was not report: and this is another of thy lyes, who
art raging in Hell, and art there digging deep.</p>
            <p>And as for <hi>Jane Stoaks,</hi> ſhe is ſufficiently known, and what her
actions have been; and thou ſayeſt, <hi>G. F. would not ſuffer her to
be aſſiſted in going to Rome,</hi> this is another of thy lyes, for I was
not at <hi>London</hi> at that time, neither did I ſpeak to her when ſhe
went, but was in <hi>Lancaſter</hi> Priſon, <hi>for thou wouldſt not ſuffer her
to be aſſiſted in her journey,</hi> ſayeſt thou; and for this lye and
ſlander of thine, thou ſcoffingly ſaith, <hi>G. F. muſt come downe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his knees,</hi> which was in a Goale neer 200 miles off when ſhe
went, neither did I here of her going till a great while afterwards;

who made a diſcord amongſt Friends, who ſimply did ſuch a thing
once, and no more, and here thou thinkeſt thou haſt ſpyed a great

fault, but doeſt not look into thine own houſe, who art before
finding fault, and judging others for ſeeking into failings, and here
thou haſt condemned thy ſelf out of thine own mouth again, to

            <p>
               <hi>And thou ſayeſt,</hi> G. F. when he was at London, takes upon him
the place of God, and orders thoſe he accounts Miniſters in his will,
and ſends them to the ſeveral meetings about London, and thither
they muſt go, whether they have a command or motion of God to go or
no, and in his abſence leaves one to order the reſt in his place the firſt

thou waſt judged out, and hath been often judged, and few or
none could ever hardly own thy going to any meeting, for when
thou waſt at the beſt ſtate, tender Friends could ſcarce beare thy
ſpirit, many complained to me of thee, and becauſe thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
run up and down in thy will I croſsed thee, and ſeverall were
moved ſo to do, as being a man hardly to be truſted, which ſince thy
actions have manifeſted themſelves; and therefore like <hi>Ham,</hi>
thou ſeekeſt for nakedneſſe if thou couldſt find any, nay worſe
than <hi>Ham,</hi> for he laid open that which was, and thou layeſt open
thy lyes, that thou mayeſt further make manifeſt thy ſelfe, that
all may judge of thee, for we do meet together its known, and
every one takes their motion, and that hath been long that meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

neither do I ſend papers to them, for by the power of God in

thou diſorderly man hath gone out of that, and grieved the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

            <p>And whereas thou ſaiſt <hi>G. F. cauſed John Fritwell and Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher

for if <hi>James Nailer,</hi> or any elſe did, or do condemn upon

wholſomneſs, this is no contradiction, but it is one with the former,
which thou ſcoffingly calls order; but thou would do what thou

therefore declare it in mens meetings, &amp; womens meetings, that is
to ſtop unclean ſpirits like thine, who declared it in the meeting at

an evil perſon thou haſt been, of an evill life and converſation: And
<hi>Gerrard Roberts</hi> ſayes he knows nothing of it, though this paper
was anſwered long agoe to that, what I had of it, moſt of thy lyes
and ſlanders before thou publiſhed it in print, who by this thinks to
viliſie with thy ſlanders and lyes; but this is but to manifeſt thy
ſelf, and to ſink thee more into the pit of darkneſs; for truth is over
thy head and all theſe things, and clears it ſelf, and the Seed reigns,
Chriſt ever was, of which I am in the one Light, before the world
began, and doth not matter what any ſlanderous ſpirit can ſay or
do of me.</p>
            <p>And all Friends, Keep your habitation in the Seed of God before
theſe things was, for lying, ſlanderous, unclean ſpirits, I do and ever
did judge, and can do no otherwiſe, I have unity with none of them,
take them who will, for that I ever denyed them, and do, and ſhall
have a witneſs in every mans conſcience that is pure, and in the
day of their downfall and condemnation, of the lyar, and the ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,
and falſe accuſer.</p>
            <p>And a great deal of lyes and ſlanders are in thy paper, which
are not worth the mentioning nor writing over, which the Seed
runs over them all; for though there be <hi>Judaſes</hi> and falſe Brethren,
and ſuch as cauſes the truth to be evil ſpoken of, and ſeeks to ſow
diſcord amongſt Brethren, and to caſt ſlanders and falſe reports,
and lyes to vilifie the righteous, the innocent, and the pure, and the
ſpotleſs, whoſe garments are pure, and clear, and lives an undefiled
life. This is no new thing to ſee ſuch appear now, for they were
of old for condemnation; and ſo it ſtands upon them, though they
riſe up againſt the righteous, and mount up to Heaven among the
Stars, and ſo fall down to the earth into Hell; this condemnation
of them was ordained of old. The Light is gone over them, in
which is our fellowſhip.</p>

            <p>THE Life and Power of God, in which ye are raiſed, and

Foundation which ſhall never be raſed our, for it is laid of
God, and no man can lay another; and ye that feel the Life and
Power of God in your ſelves, ye feel Chriſt the Salvation, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
and Wiſdome of God, and ſo ye by the power of God
are kept and preserved in ſincerity and integrity to God, and
thereby comes to be eſtabliſhed upon the Rock, which the Gates

ye ſtand and live in that which ſcatters the clouds, and keeps
your eye clear to the Lord God, by which Power ye ſee in a good

the darkneſſe, and by the Power are preſerved out of the<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

and this is the true freedome in the Son, who dyed and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and is riſen again in life, and brought Life and Immortality to

God, and heirs of the everlaſting Kingdome of God, where ye
have a ſure portion in the Joy, and Peace, and Bleſſing of God, in
which ſit ye down and keep your habitation, and the God of life
and peace, and endleſs love, be with you all, and cloath you with
the Garment of everlaſting praiſe, that in all things ye may give
him the Glory, who lives for evermore.</p>
            <p>And Dear Friends, Be ye all watchful in the Light by which ye
were and are convinced, for the Times are perilous Times, yea,
and that amongſt ſuch as profeſſe to one Truth, and by declaration
ſpeak the ſame words; and ſuch there are crept in amongſt Friends
in the truth, who by fair words and ſeeming appearances ſeeks to
ſubvert the ſimple minded, and to beguile the unſtable ſouls, and
ſo would beget a diſlike in the hearts of Friends, againſt ſuch as
Godhath raiſed and exalted in his heavenly Power, Life, and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45283:10"/>
and ſuch Papers there are in Print, which are publiſhed
by <hi>John Harwood</hi> againſt <hi>G.F.</hi> wherein he hath ſlanderouſly report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of him, and falſly accuſed him; and if any ſuch papers come
amongſt you, or that ye may hear a report of them, let not your
minds be haſty to believe, that what is ſo reported is truth, but
weigh the matter in the savoury life, and you will feel that it came
from a very bad ſpirit, and not worthy of any acceptation amongſt
Friends that live in the ſavour of truth, but is to be judged, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d,
and caſt out. And all that live in the truth and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of it, will find a ſufficient anſwer in themſelves, by which
they may receive their ſatiſfaction. And this is ſignified unto
Friends, that no lyes nor ſlanderous reports may reſt upon the
truth, nor remain upon the innocency of Gods anoynted, but with
the true ſpirit of Judgment they may all be cleanſed out from
amongſt the heritage of God.</p>
            <p>And Friends, All that abides in the truth doth certainly know
that <hi>G.F.</hi> was raiſed by the mighty power of God, and hath not
preached himſelf, but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, and himſelf a Servant
for Jeſus ſake; he is a living witneſs of the Reſurrection of the
Juſt, not handling the Word of God deceitfully, nor uſing flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſpeech at any time, but in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity he
hath ſpoken in Chriſt the everlaſting Seed; and his word hath not
been yea and nay, but from the beginning his word and his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hath been unchangeable, and he the ſame in the truth, without
any variableneſſe, and he is grown up in <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the mighty power
of God, and is cloathed with the heavenly wiſdome of God, where
his life is hid from the eyes of his accuſers; and they that love the
truth, and abide in it, do know that he hath ever been dear and
tender over the good in all, and hath judged the evil with righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
judgment; and though there be many riſen, which would
weaken his teſtimony, as if it was not what it had been, yet all that
have received his teſtimony, and continue in his doctrine, have a
more ſure evidence concerning his life, then to be ſhaken or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at the report of falſe accuſers, which in the Light is ſeen to be
that ſpirit which ſtrikes at the Life it ſelf, and ſo would kill and
take poſſeſſion, which ſpirit is to be judged by all Friends in the
truth, and the ſouls of ſuch pitied who with it are enſnared; for
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45283:10"/>
the day of the Lord is to paſs upon it, and it ſhall ſuddenly with<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r
and periſh, and come to nought; and all that give up their belief
unto it, and therein doth abide, they ſhall fall as leaves from the
Tree, when the vertue retires into its Root. But as for <hi>G.F.</hi> the
Lord God hath exalted him, and the Glory of the Lord reſts upon
him, and all that have received his Teſtimony in the love of it, and
the Teſtimony of ſuch as preaches the ſame Word, and therein
doth abide, even the ſame glory in their meaſures doth reſt upon
them, and a ſure defence is ſtretched over it, and the Storms of
reſtleſs Clouds ſhall never blaſt it, nor the waves of the troubled
Sea ſlow over it, the Lord hath ſpoken it. And this is manifeſted
unto Friends in love to the everlaſting truth of God, not ſetting up
a man, or throwing down a man, but in all things giving the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
preheminence, and in dearneſs to the Veſsel that is filled with
the excellency of that treaſure, and alſo beating down the Prince
of the Power of the Air, the ſpirit that worketh in the children of
diſobedience; knowing in the Counſel of the Lord God, that
whatſoever ſuch ſpirits pretend to, or in what likeneſſe ſoever they
do appear, yet the deceivableneſſe of unrighteouſneſs is lodged in
the Root: And therefore my dear Friends, of all ſuch beware,
and love the word of truth, and live in it, that in love, meekneſs,
and peaceableneſs, ye may feel your reſt in the boſome of the
Lamb; and the bleſſing of the Lord God be upon you for
ever.</p>
