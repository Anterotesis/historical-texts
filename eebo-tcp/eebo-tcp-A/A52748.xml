         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

for a Time I my Self was ſo
too, till ſome Cauſes made me to reflect
with an impartiall eye upon the Affairs
of this <hi>new Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon, beginning ſeriouſly to
ſearch into the nature of it, with the
many <hi>Pleas</hi> and <hi>Objections</hi> made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it; And ſuppoſing thoſe learned
men who wrote before theſe Times,
were moſt likely to ſpeak truth, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
un-intereſted in our Affairs, and
un-concerned in the Controverſie, I
took a view of their Reaſons and Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and from thence made ſo many
Collections, that putting them in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and comparing all together, they
<pb facs="tcp:104589:3"/>
ſoon made a <hi>Conqueſt</hi> over me and my
<hi>Opinion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know the high Talkers, the lighter

many a <hi>bitter Arrow</hi> to wound my <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,</hi>
and charge me with <hi>Levity</hi>
and <hi>Inconſtancy,</hi> becauſe I am not obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
like themſelves, againſt Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Right Reaſon, Neceſsity, the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
of all Nations, and the Peace of
our own. But this ſort of men I reckon
<hi>inter Bruta animantia;</hi> among whom to
do well is to hear ill; who uſually ſpeak
amiſſe of thoſe things that they do not,
or will not underſtand. From them
therefore I appeale to the <hi>Great Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi>
where it is known I have in this
dealt faithfully; and to the more ſober
Intelligences, here below, with whom
theſe Papers muſt needs find the more
<hi>free entertainment,</hi> becauſe free from

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:104589:3"/>
And that they may be the fitter to
walk abroad in the world, I have divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them into <hi>Two Parts,</hi> and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated
Them with a <hi>Method,</hi> ſuitable
to thoſe two Parties whereof the world
conſiſts; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Conſcientious</hi> man, and
the <hi>Worldling.</hi> The former wil approve
nothing but what is <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>equitable;</hi>
and therefore I have labored to ſatisfie
him (as I have done my Self) touching
the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of Submiſsion: The latter
will imbrace any thing, ſo it make for
his <hi>Profit;</hi> and therefore I have ſhewn
him the <hi>Inconveniences</hi> and <hi>Dangers,</hi>
that will follow his oppoſition of a <hi>ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
Now, though the other ſhould
continue <hi>obſtinate</hi> in their <hi>erroneous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences;</hi>
yet of this latter ſort, I dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
my Self an abundance of <hi>Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes,</hi>
the greater part of the world being
led more by Appetites of <hi>Convenience</hi>
and <hi>Commodity,</hi> than the Dictates of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:104589:4"/>
And it is a more current way of
perſwaſion, by telling men what will be
<hi>profitable</hi> and <hi>convenient</hi> for them to do,
than what they <hi>ought</hi> to do.</p>
            <p>But Prethee read, and then do what
thou liſt: I have onely one word more;
&amp; that is to our <hi>modern Phariſee,</hi> the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencious
Pretender,</hi> and principall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturber
of the publique Peace. If hee
will not be convinced by ſo clear Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
but raiſe more duſt about our
ears, to amaze the People, it muſt be
concluded; That all this noiſe of <hi>Church-Reformation,
Conſcience,</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> is
a mere malicious Deſigne to drive on a
<hi>Faction,</hi> for the caſting down of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Governers, that they may ſet up
Themſelves in the Seat of Authority.—
<hi>Farewell,</hi> and be wiſe. Being convinced
of the Truth of theſe Things, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
my Self obliged, to ſhew others
the ſame way of ſatisfaction.</p>

                  <p>TO cleare this, we need do no more but take a review of
thoſe Governments mentioned in the former Chapter, in
their Riſe and Revolutions. The World, after the <hi>Flood,</hi> in time
grew more populous; &amp; more exceeding vitious, being inclined
to rapine, ambition, &amp;c. ſo that the <hi>Pater familiar</hi> way of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
being inſufficient to correct thoſe grand enormities,
there was need of ſome one more potent then the reſt, that
might reſtraine them by force.<note place="margin">Vide <hi>Peterium</hi> ſupra Geneſin.</note> Upon which Ground it was,
that <hi>Nimrod,</hi> firſt of all men, complotted a new and arbitrary
way of Government, backing it with Power by a party of his

might be cut off by Compulſion; and that by a power ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in his own <hi>Sword</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> he might oppoſe the wilfulneſſe
of others: But he, afterwards abuſing this power, by ſtretching
his own <hi>will</hi> too far over other men's <hi>wills,</hi> to the prejudice

                  <p>If we look to the Originall of the <hi>Romans,</hi> we find <hi>Romulus</hi>
and his Succeſſors, founding a Kingdom upon the ruins of their
Kindred, Friends and Neighbors. Next, the <hi>Kingly Title</hi> gained
by the Sword and Subtilty, was the ſame way derived to divers
of the 7 Kings, and at length extinguiſh'd in <hi>Tarquin</hi> by the
<hi>Sword of the Senate;</hi> wherewith they drave, and kept him out
of his Dominions, and made a Title to thoſe alſo of other
Nations, ſo far, that in the end they entituled themſelves <hi>Lords
of the whole Earth,</hi> and ſo continued, till <hi>Caeſar</hi> wreſting the
<hi>ſword</hi> out of their hands, became Maſter both of it and them:
Moſt of the Succeſſors of <hi>Caeſar</hi> likewiſe made way by the

of the reſt, by policy, murther, and the Favor of the Soldiery.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104589:9"/>
At length the Sword divided the Empire into <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt,</hi>
and in the ſame manner likewiſe each of them ſuffered many
titular ſubdiviſions, till new Titles were raiſed in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> by
the <hi>Sword</hi> of the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandals;</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> by the <hi>Turks</hi>

                  <p>If this be not obvious enough out of profane Hiſtories, take
a view of thoſe in <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> where you ſhall find the <hi>ſword</hi> the
onely diſpoſer, and diſpenſer of Titles to Common-weals and
Kingdomes. We find <hi>Jacob</hi> on his death-bed, bequeathing one
Portion to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> above the reſt of his brethren; and that was
a Parcell which he took out of the hand of the <hi>Amorite</hi> with
<hi>his Sword,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 48. v. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>and with his Bow;</hi> unto which Parcell the Scripture
mentions not any Title that <hi>Jacob</hi> had, but by his Sword. And
as for the <hi>Title</hi> which his poſterity had unto the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>
though it were allotted them by divine promiſe and
diſpenſation; yet (as to the eye of the world) they were to
lay claime and take poſſeſſion by the <hi>Power of the Sword,</hi> and
ſo accordingly they received commiſſion to ratifie their Title,
by a Conqueſt of the <hi>Canaanites;</hi> after which, <hi>Jure gentium,</hi> it
became for ever <hi>unquestionable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Hiſtory of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> we read, that moſt of
their Titles have been founded upon powerfull uſurpation:
ſuch was that of <hi>Ieroboam;</hi> who though the Kingdome were
deſigned to him by a Declaration from heaven in the mouth
of the Prophet, erred notwithſtanding in his over-ſpeedy inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Soveraignty by force; and that Act of his is branded
with the black Character of <hi>Rebellion.</hi> Yet being thus gotten
into the Throne, God would not ſuffer him to be diſturbed,
ſaying,<note place="margin">1 Kings 12. 24</note> the <hi>Thing was from him;</hi> that is, by his permiſſion; And
ſo he that was a Traytor in <hi>rebellion,</hi> being once inveſted by a
meer permiſſive Act of Providence, came to have a poſitive
Right, to the prejudice of him that was his Soveraigne, and to
the exerciſe of Juriſdiction over thoſe, that had been of late
his <hi>Fellow-Subjects.</hi>

                  <p>After <hi>Jeroboam</hi> reigned his Son <hi>Nadab,</hi> who was conquered

the <hi>French</hi> King's Title to what he holds at home; and if we

to a Period, I ſhall draw nearer home, and make it as
clearly appear likewiſe; that the <hi>Power of the Sword</hi> ever hath
been the Foundation of all Titles to Government in <hi>England,</hi>
both before, and ſince the <hi>Norman Conquest.</hi> Firſt, the Sword
of <hi>Caeſar</hi> triumphed over the Liberties of the poor <hi>Britaines,</hi>

and gave the <hi>Romans</hi> here a Title to their Dominion. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
their Liberty returning again, when the <hi>Roman Empire</hi>
fell to pieces, a new <hi>Title</hi> was ſetled by the <hi>Sword</hi> of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors
the <hi>Saxons,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Chron.</note> who ſubmitted for a Time, upon the ſame

Now, if in theſe nationall revolutions of Government, I ſhould
examine thoſe alſo of the <hi>Regall Families,</hi> we cannot from any

Tranſitions of <hi>Title</hi> from Family to Family, meerly upon the

                  </p>
                  <p>And upon examination it appears, he had no better Title to
<hi>England,</hi> then the reſt before mentioned had at firſt to their

of <hi>Maud,</hi> who, as Heir of his Predeceſſors way of Uſurpation,
Quarter'd the Armes of <hi>England</hi> with the Lordſhip of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
by the <hi>Sword;</hi> as his Succeſſor <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, by the ſame means,

with the Blood of <hi>Leoline</hi> and his Brother <hi>David,</hi> the laſt
of the <hi>Welch</hi> Princes.<note place="margin">See the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles.</note> Next, <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond was forced by
Armes to ſurrender his Right to his Sonne <hi>Edward</hi> the third,
whoſe Grand-child <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond was in like manner by
force of Armes deprived by <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> whoſe Sonne
<hi>Henry</hi> the fifth made good not onely that Title, but craved out
a new one with his <hi>Sword</hi> to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> in defiance
of the <hi>Salick</hi> Conſtitution; and left it ſo confirmed unto his
Sonne <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, that he was Crowned King of <hi>France</hi>
at <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſo continued, till (Fortune turning) his Title was
Cancell'd there by the Sword of the <hi>French,</hi> as it was likewiſe in
<hi>England</hi> by that of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth; whoſe Sonne <hi>Edward</hi>
the fifth left the Crown in the bloody hands of <hi>Richard</hi> the
third, from whence it was wreſted by <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh. This
<hi>Henry</hi> (from whom the late King derived his Claime) came in
with an Army, and (as one hath well obſerved) <hi>by meer Power
was made King in the Army, and by the Army; ſo that in the very
Field where he got the Victory, the Crown was ſet upon his Head,
and there he gave Knighthood to many of his Commanders.</hi> Upon
<hi>this Foundation of Military Power, he got himſelf afterwards ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
Crowned at</hi> Weſtminſter. <hi>And ſoon after, upon Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
thus gotten, he called a Parliament, and in that Parliament
was the Crown entailed upon him and his Heirs. Thus both his
Crown and his Parliament were founded upon Power: As for any
just Title, he could have none; for, he deſcended from a Baſtard of</hi>
John <hi>of</hi> Gaunt, <hi>which (though legitimated for common Inheritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
yet) expreſly was excluded from Succeſſion to the Crown. And
for his Wives Title, that came in after his Kingſhip, and his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
which had ſetled the Crown before upon him and his Heirs.
And he was ſo far from exerciſing authority in her Right, that her
Name is not uſed in any Laws, as Queen</hi> Mary's <hi>was, both before
and after her Marriage with the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, having made it evident out of the Hiſtories of all Times,
our own, and other Nations, that the <hi>Power of the Sword</hi> ever
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104589:13"/>
hath been the Foundation of Titles to Government, it is as
clear likewiſe out of the ſame Hiſtories, that the People never
preſumed to ſpurne at thoſe Powers, but (for publique Peace

Revolutions. But it were vain to raiſe more duſt out of
the Cobwebs of Antiquity in ſo limpid a Caſe, confirmed by the

and never ſo much as blamed for it by the Divines of their
own, or any other Nation. Moreover, none can deny, but that
as <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, and the reſt before mentioned, came into

                  <p>One <hi>Objection</hi> more he hath; how that <hi>a Calling from the
People, being neceſſary and eſſentiall, to a humanely conſtituted
Magiſtracy,</hi> our preſent Governors ought to have ſuch a <hi>Call;</hi>
but not having it, they are therefore concluded guilty of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation.</hi>
This is the ſumm of the <hi>Objection,</hi> though not Syllogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically
deciphered. To which I anſwer: 1. That if only a Call
from the People conſtitute a lawfull Magiſtracy, then there hath
very rarely ever been any lawfull Magiſtracy in the world,
nor among us long before and ſince the <hi>Conqueſt.</hi> The proofe
of this may be confirmed by a Review of thoſe Inſtances ſet
down before in the ſecond <hi>Chapter;</hi> where it is evident, that all
the world over, moſt <hi>Princes</hi> came into the Seat of Authority
not only without a <hi>Call,</hi> but abſolutely againſt the wills of the
People, and ſo, many of them exerciſe the Soveraignty to this
very day: And particularly, here in <hi>England,</hi> moſt of our own
Kings reigned without any <hi>Call,</hi> but made way by their Swords;
there being of thoſe 25 Princes that have King'd it among us,
not above half a dozen that came to the Crowne in an orderly
Succeſſion, either by lineall or collaterall Title: And not any
one of thoſe <hi>halfe dozen</hi> but laid claime to it, by vertue of
their Predeceſſors Uſurpations, without any <hi>Call</hi> from the
People; onely in the Inveſtiture they had their conſent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
out of a love of publike Peace, none would, or out of
Feare, none durſt offer to queſtion their Titles. Now, if the
former part of this Objection were true, that a <hi>Call</hi> were the
only <hi>Eſſentiall,</hi> conſtituting a lawfull Government, then it
would follow, that as all the world, ſo we and our Anceſtors
have lived and paid obedience for the moſt part, under an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
Magiſtracie; which ſure no ſober man will affirm. But
if any will be ſo mad as to ſay it, I only propound to him this
ſober <hi>Quaere,</hi> Why we may not now as lawfully ſubmit to the
preſent Magiſtracy, in caſe it were unlawfull, as our Anceſtors
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104589:16"/>
did heretofore to theirs, for the publike Peace of the Nation?</p>
                  <p>2. As to the <hi>Aſſumptive</hi> part part of this <hi>Objection,</hi> which inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates,
that our preſent Governors have no <hi>Call</hi> or <hi>Conſent</hi>
of the People, I anſwer, That if by the conſent be meant
the Conſent of the Body of the People, or of the major part of
their Repreſentatives, this may hold requiſite in a State not
divided by <hi>Civill War,</hi> but at Peace within it ſelf; where it is
moſt conſonant to reaſon, that in caſe there be occaſion to elect
a ſupreme Magiſtrate, or Magiſtrates, the election ſhould be
carried by the greater number of <hi>Voices,</hi> in ſuch manner as <hi>Voices</hi>
are uſually given in that State; But now in a <hi>Civil War</hi> the caſe is
altered, when the controverſie touching Government is decided
by the Sword: For, <hi>ipſo facto</hi> the <hi>Sword</hi> creates a Title for him,
or thoſe that bear it,<note place="margin">Majeſtatem realem durare conſtat, quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diu, vel vi ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

one <hi>Objection</hi> very frequent in the mouthes of many: That this

civill Diviſions within the ſame Nation, as in war betwixt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Nation: For, where a Nation is ingaged in a <hi>Civill
war,</hi> and divided into parties, the eye of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nations</hi>
looks not on them as one Nation,<note place="margin">In Tract at. de <hi>Legatis.</hi>
                     </note> but as two, according to
that of <hi>Grotius: In Regno diviſo, gens una, pro tempore, quaſi duae
gentes habentur:</hi> In a divided State, one Nation, during the
time of its Nationall Diviſions, is eſteemed as two Nations; ſo
that what preeminence Nation may gaine over Nation by right
of <hi>forein war,</hi> the ſame may be obtained likewiſe by one part of
a Nation againſt the other, by Right of <hi>civill war:</hi> And what
the <hi>forein Conqueror</hi> may doe in changing the Government, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhing

Right and juſt Title to be our Governours; and that this new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment

both thoſe Oaths are <hi>Religious Acts,</hi> as they are ſolemnized
with the Invocation of God, as a Witneſſe; but as all Actions
are qualified from their principall End; ſo the maine end of
thoſe Oaths being Obedience to the Prince in order to the good

an alteration of Affairs ſhall happen as extinguiſhes his Title, I
conceive we are not obliged, in this Caſe, to pay him that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion

And the other which relates to <hi>Religion,</hi> is as to manner of

the pulling down of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> to introduce another Form
more ſuitable to their own ambitious ends, ſince that Form that

that either of them obſerve it with Fidelity to each other. But
the <hi>Scots</hi> have been ſo far from obſerving, that the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <div n="1" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Concerning the Royall Party.</head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Royalliſts</hi> are of two Sorts. <hi>Firſt,</hi> ſuch as adhere to the
<hi>Prince</hi> out of <hi>neceſſity; Secondly,</hi> ſuch as adhere to him out
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:104589:22"/>
of <hi>humor.</hi> The former are Thoſe, who being hopeleſſe of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
or of the recovery of their Fortunes, by way of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement,
are conſtrained to run any hazard abroad with the
head of their Party, and turne every ſtone to over-turn the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Powers here in <hi>England,</hi> that they may ſet up Themſelves.
The latter Sort of <hi>Royalliſts,</hi> are ſuch, as though they ſerved
heretofore under the <hi>Royall Standard,</hi> yet, through the Favour
of the Parliament, have re-gained poſſeſſion of their Eſtates:
And therefore being re-inveſted with their Fortunes, They are
loth as yet to attend the <hi>Prince</hi> in perſon, though they follow
him with their wiſhes, and would be glad to imbrace any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
underhand, or perhaps (when time ſerves) appear here
again in the Field, to make way for his Advancement. Theſe
may (not improperly) be called <hi>humorous Royalliſts,</hi> becauſe
they have only an obſtinate and <hi>vain-glorious humor</hi> for the
ground of their behaviour, without any reſpect of Advantage
to Themſelves, but are ridden by the other to carry on the <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Royall</hi>
deſigne of Particular perſons, and run a new hazard of
their own. To reſtore the ſingle Family of a <hi>Prince,</hi> ſuppreſſed by
the <hi>Almighty,</hi> they ſeeme willing to Venture the deſtruction of
all their own Families; and to ſerve the ends of certain Perſons
about him, men whoſe Fortunes are deſperate, they are apt to
foole themſelves into the loſſe of their owne; as they muſt needs
doe, if the <hi>Prince</hi> miſ-carry in his Enterprize, whereas if he
ſhould carry it with Succeſſe, They will be then but where they
were, They can be but <hi>Maſters</hi> of what they have already. The
<hi>high Ranters</hi> and Fugitives are they that will be look't on at
<hi>Court;</hi> Thoſe <hi>Bell-weathers</hi> of <hi>Royalty</hi> will <hi>bear away the Bell
of Preferment,</hi> whilſt the poore <hi>Countrey-Royalliſts</hi> (both <hi>Gentry</hi>

the <hi>forlorn Brethren</hi> of the <hi>Sword,</hi> the many <hi>yonger Brothers,</hi>
and <hi>Strangers,</hi> which will come in with the <hi>Grandees,</hi> in hope to
purchaſe a Fortune by ſqueezing the Publique.</p>
                  <p>All which being conſidered, it is awonder to ſee, how They
feed Themſelves with Phant'ſies, who pretend in this Nation to
the reſtitution of <hi>Royality;</hi> how their eyes are dazled with that
<hi>Sun</hi> which ſeems to riſe upon their Party, ſuppoſing the <hi>golden

                     </hi> muſt needs return again with him, and that he will climb
up to the <hi>Meridian,</hi> in ſpight of all oppoſition! But to give
them a Cooler for theſe Conceits, I ſhall more particularly,
according to the Method before propounded, ſhew firſt the
Improbability of Succeſſe in the new <hi>Royall Deſignes;</hi> and then,
the grand Inconveniences that would follow ſuch a Succeſſe,
that all miſtaken Perſons may ſee, how far they wander (to the
hazard of themſelves) out of that way, which leads to the future
happineſſe of this Nation.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Improbability</hi> of the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Succeſſe in his Deſigne,
Firſt, he is like to have but a ſlender Supply of <hi>forein Aids:</hi> For,
the Affairs of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> are at this time ſo diſpoſed, that
ſome Princes want leiſure; others ability to aſſiſt Him: And
divers there are which refrain, for particular <hi>Reaſons of State.</hi>
The <hi>Spaniard</hi> hath other <hi>Fiſh to frie,</hi> keeping a ſerious eie upon
<hi>France,</hi> and lying at Catch againſt <hi>Portugal.</hi> Beſides, there are
ſeverall Reaſons (not fit here to mention) which may diſpoſe
him rather to imbrace the Amity of this <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> as it is
now eſtabliſhed; and whereof there is ſome hope (were there
no other ground) in that he hath given our <hi>Agent</hi> a friendly
reception.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe hath the King of <hi>Portugall</hi> too another <hi>Agent;</hi>
and how far he is from neglecting our Friendſhip, may appear
by his Demeanour toward our Fleet, in the Port of <hi>Lisbon,</hi>
where he hath given them the like Freedom and entertainment
as he doth to <hi>Rupert,</hi> carrying himſelfe indifferently between
both, though he ſeem a little to incline ſomewhat more toward
<hi>Rupert;</hi> not out of any good will, but only in regard of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engagement
to that Party.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> hath his hands full enough at home, ſo
that he hath little liſt or leiſure to mind Affairs abroad; being
jealous not only of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but even of his owne Subjects,
by reaſon of their regret at the inſupporrtable Taxes, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents
and Bandyings of his Parliaments in the ſeverall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
and the Partiſans of the <hi>Impriſoned Princes;</hi> all which
ſeem to threaten (if not the <hi>Monarchy</hi> it Self, yet) the Family
of the <hi>Monarch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Denmark</hi> hath hitherto given but a coole Acknowledgment
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:104589:23"/>
of ſo neare an alliance, having been (at the beſt) but a Retiring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place
for <hi>Montroſe,</hi> ſeconding this with ſome other ſlight ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
courteſies; one of the beſt of which was (to rid their hands
of their Gueſt) by lending him a few <hi>Bottoms,</hi> firſt, to ſeek his
better Fortune in <hi>Swethland,</hi> and then to waft him and his <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn
hope</hi> toward their long homes, into <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some ſuch triviall Supplies likewiſe may be expected from
the <hi>Swede,</hi> with a few Complements from the <hi>Emperour</hi> and
<hi>German</hi> Princes, their jealouſies of each other not permitting
them to ſpare their Forces: For, whoſoever conſiders the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes
and Shifts made by the <hi>Emperour</hi> and his party, in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the Articles of Peace; and on the other ſide, the reſolution
of the <hi>Swede</hi> and that Party to have them fully performed (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with thoſe heart-burnings among them, which break out
often into Flames in every Corner) may eaſily imagine the peace
of <hi>Germany</hi> is not long-liv'd, and therefore that neither of thoſe
<hi>Princes</hi> will part with many of their Soldiery.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> eſteem it a ſafe way to conform themſelves
ever to the Prevailing Party in <hi>England,</hi> having Reaſon, above
all others, to prize the Friendſhip and Amity of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Nation. And though ſome common Courteſies are expreſſed
there to the <hi>Prince</hi> by way of entertainment; yet theſe are
done rather to comply with the deſires of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
than out of any inclination or affection to the <hi>Royall Party;</hi>
whereas the Sence of the <hi>States Provinciall</hi> (and in them the
meaning of the whole People) is, to preſerve a ſtrict Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with the Common-wealth of <hi>England.</hi> Nor do they reliſh
thoſe cloſe Combinations between the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and his
<hi>Brother;</hi> fearing ſo great an Alliance may diſpoſe <hi>Orange</hi> to
aſpire, and eſtabliſh a greater <hi>Intereſt</hi> of his own than is meet
for a Member of a Republique, if <hi>Monarchy</hi> come to its height
again in <hi>England;</hi> which they ought by no means to deſire, but
rather that <hi>England</hi> ſhould continue as it is; not onely for the
former Reaſon, but alſo, for that ſuch a <hi>Neighbourhood</hi> would be
concerned in Reaſon, to admit Them into a nearer Friendſhip
and Complication of <hi>Intereſts,</hi> than ever they can hope from a
<hi>Monarchy.</hi>—</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being conſidered, the <hi>Prince</hi> hath ſmall hope of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104589:23"/>
Succeſſe, in regard of any conſiderable Supplies from <hi>Forein
Princes.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Put caſe he can, by the help of the many <hi>fugitive
Engliſh,</hi> the <hi>Scots,</hi> and Supplies drain'd out of the Dregs of
ſeverall Countries, make ſhift to patch up an Army, or two, to
trie his Fortune, yet 'tis ten to one but They ruine his Deſigne.
For, firſt, the introducing of <hi>Forrainers</hi> will ſoone alienate the

by the Aides of other <hi>Princes,</hi> let us ſee whether he have any

a Conqueſt of <hi>England.</hi> As for <hi>Ireland,</hi> he hath but poore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
thence, ſince the <hi>Lord Lieuten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thoſe Adverſaries with the Beſome of Vengeance, and made
way by a continued chain of miraculous Succeſſes, to Shackle
that Rebellious Nation; and doubts not ere long, to <hi>bind their
Princes with Chaines, and their Nobles with links of Iron,</hi> ſince
every month brings in freſh <hi>Laurels</hi> of Victory, to their Terror
and amazement. But <hi>Ireland</hi> being given for loſt, let us ſee next,
whether the <hi>Royalliſts</hi> are like to receive any more comfort
from <hi>Scotland:</hi> Its an old ſaying, <hi>Nullum bonum ex Aquilone,</hi>
No good comes out of the North; and of all others, <hi>Royalliſts</hi>
ſhould be the leaſt apt to beleeve any benefit to come out of that
<hi>Nation,</hi> from whence proceeded the Ruine and Deſtruction of
the late <hi>King,</hi> and all their Party; nor can they hope much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of them in time to come. For, <hi>firſt,</hi> They adhere to the
<hi>Prince,</hi> not out of any love to his <hi>Intereſt,</hi> but onely in hope to
ſettle their own upon his Shoulders; and therefore if they can
make a better Bargain elſewhere, they wil caſt him off, or (if he be
in their power) ſell him off (as they did his <hi>Father)</hi> upon the
firſt occaſion. What elſe can he expect from a Party, whoſe <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi>
was firſt founded upon the ruine of his <hi>Great Grand-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
continued and augmented to the perpetuall vexation of his
<hi>Grand father,</hi> and at length proſecuted to the deſtruction of his
<hi>Father? Secondly,</hi> it is impoſſible to reconcile the two Parties,
<hi>Royall</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> even as impoſſible <hi>(King James</hi> was
wont to ſay) as to reconcile <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Devill. Thirdly,</hi> if
They cannot be reconciled or ſtand together, then whatſoever
Agreemens may be made, it will be but from the Teeth
outward; nor can there be an union betwixt them upon any
deſigne, but in the proſecution thereof they will mind the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of their ſeverall Intereſts, which muſt make them
jealous of each other, divided and partiall in their Counſels, and
cauſe the inward rancor to break out, to the prejudice and
utter ruine of the whole Engagement. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> let the <hi>Scots</hi>
invade us again upon the <hi>Royall,</hi> or what ſcore elſe they pleaſe,
They will never be endured (eſpecially in the <hi>Northern</hi> Parts)
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:104589:24"/>
having heretofore by their perfidious and Tyrannical behaviour,
fixed an odious Impreſſion upon the Spirits of the People, and
quickned the old Antipathy betwixt the two Nations: So that,
if the <hi>Prince</hi> come in with them, or by them, he will fare never
the better (but much worſe) for their Sakes, or their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
<hi>Laſtly,</hi> they come (if they dare come) a moſt naſty,
lowzie, beaten Generation, againſt one of the moſt generous,
beſt accompliſhed, and moſt Victorious Armies in <hi>Chriſtendome;</hi>
an Army that muſt needs be diſhonoured by ſuch an Enemy,
from whom neither Credit nor Advantage is to be gotten; yet
it is meet they ſhould be chaſtized, ſince the <hi>Almighty,</hi> out of
love to the future Peace of our Nation, ſeemes to decree, that
<hi>Belial</hi> and <hi>Dagon, Montroſe,</hi> and the <hi>Kirk,</hi> with her <hi>Worthies</hi>
ſhould be ſent after <hi>Hamilton.</hi> This indeed, would be a fair ſtep
to <hi>Reformation,</hi> by letting out the Corruption of that Country,
which ſticks like a <hi>Scab,</hi> upon the faire Body of this <hi>Fortunate
Iſland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, in the laſt place, to conclude this particular touching the
Improbability of the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Succeſſe, ſince he hath little ground
to hope for any by the aſſiſtance of other <hi>Nations,</hi> let us examine
what hope he hath from our own. Severall Reaſons may be
given to the contrary; As firſt, the People's hatred of <hi>Foreiners,</hi>
and their feare of that Plague, univerſall <hi>Free-quarter,</hi> with their
averſneſſe to War, having taſted ſome time of the Sweets of
<hi>Peace;</hi> And though they are ſenſible of ſome neceſſary Burthens,
yet conſidering another War will increaſe new ones, more exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant,
every man would be content with things as they are; for,
the Common people (as the <hi>Poet</hi> ſaith)

                     </q>
will be ſatisfied with Bread and Quietneſſe, rather than
hazard their Eaſe and Security, to ſerve the Ambition of
others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> They will be the leſſe apt to engage in any new
<hi>Inſurrections</hi> and Parties, ſince the laſt thrived ſo ill, to the
Prejudice and ſhame of all the Undertakers: Examples make
Men wiſe; and though many of them eſcaped without puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in regard this<note n="*" place="margin">See the <hi>new Acts</hi> of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the <hi>Act</hi> for eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing an <hi>High Court of Juſtice.</hi>
                     </note> Government was not then declared; yet
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:104589:25"/>
now that it is <hi>eſtabliſhed,</hi> and Laws are made to defend it againſt
all that offend in time to come, men will beware (I ſuppoſe)
how they meddle, ſince they can expect nothing leſſe after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
War, than the puniſhment of <hi>Traitors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Put caſe the Counties were reſolv'd upon <hi>New Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,</hi>
yet what can be done by unweildy Bodies of raw Men,
taken from the <hi>Streets,</hi> the <hi>Plow,</hi> or the <hi>Harrow;</hi> rude, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted
with <hi>Military Diſciplin,</hi> againſt a well-diſciplin'd
Army of <hi>Old Soldiers?</hi> Conſider what became of thoſe vaſt
numbers in <hi>Kent, Eſſex, &amp;c.</hi> with what eaſe they were diſperſed,
and how ſoon they vaniſhed into nothing!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is not like, that the <hi>Gentry,</hi> men of <hi>Eſtates,</hi> will
ſtir in any conſiderable number, to hazard their Poſſeſſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
yet ſcarce warm in them, after a <hi>Purchaſe</hi> made upon dear
rates of Compoſition; But if any are ſo mad as to venture on
new Deſignes, they might do well to conſider how hard a
matter it is to carry them on without diſcovery, ſeeing the <hi>State</hi>
hath a Party and Friends, in all Countries and Corporations.
Beſides, if They could carry it ſo cloſe, as to bring any petty
deſigne into Action, yet they cannot but be ſnap't, and <hi>nip't in
the Bud,</hi> the <hi>Militia</hi> being ſo well ſetled, and a Party ready in
Armes in every County—Now, all theſe parcells of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
being well weighed together, I leave every mans <hi>Intellect</hi>
to make the Concluſion; what ſlender probability of Succeſſe
there is, by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Foreiners</hi> or <hi>Natives</hi> in the preſent
<hi>Royall Deſigne</hi> againſt <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus, in the former part of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> ſhewn the
Improbability of Succeſſe in the new <hi>Royall enterprrize,</hi> which
were enough to wean Wiſe men from engaging upon that <hi>Score,</hi>
I ſhall (according to the <hi>Method</hi> propounded) in the next place
ſtate thoſe <hi>Grand Inconveniences,</hi> which would unavoidably
follow to the prejudice of the whole Nation, in caſe the <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alliſts</hi>
ſhould proceed with Succeſſe, to the ruine of this <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
The very conſideration whereof ſhould (me thinks) be
ſufficient to ſtartle all underſtanding men, from wiſhing well to
that <hi>Party.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> ſince there can be no <hi>Medium</hi> of Reconcilement
betwixt our preſent <hi>Governours</hi> and the <hi>Son of the late King,</hi> it is
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:104589:25"/>
granted by all, that if ever he come into poſſeſſion, it muſt be
by <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> and the <hi>Power of the Sword:</hi> If ſo, then he will be
as abſolute as was <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conqueror,</hi> and we all muſt be in
the ſame ſlaviſh Condition, as our Fore-fathers were, under the
Tyranny of that <hi>Norman Baſtard.</hi> That Government which
heretofore was called <hi>Monarchicall</hi> will then be exactly <hi>Tyranny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cic. <hi>ad</hi> Art. 7. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 5.</note>
according to that ſaying of prudent <hi>Cicero</hi> in one of his

                     <hi>Henry,</hi> the Son of

wrought an Accommodation betwixt them,<note place="margin">See <hi>Daniel.</hi> in the life of King <hi>Stephen.</hi>
                     </note> upon this Ground,
becauſe <hi>they conceived it dangerous for them, and the whole State, to
have a young Prince get the Maſtery by his Sword:</hi> For, Princes
ever improve ſuch kinds of Victory to an Advantage over the
People, and Succeſſe makes them cruell; withneſſe the ſavage

that he is noted in our <hi>Chronicles,</hi> to be the firſt of all our Kings,

of Butchering the Bodies of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by <hi>Behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and <hi>Quartering.</hi> This may be enough to ſhew, that to
bring any Prince into poſſeſſion by the <hi>Sword,</hi> is to inſtate him
in a <hi>Tyranny.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Though the Prince of himſelf ſhould not be inclined

hope they ſhall be eaſed of <hi>Exciſe</hi> and <hi>Taxes, &amp;c.</hi> if he be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored,
they are exceedingly miſtaken. I remember a Paſſage out
of the Stories of <hi>France;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Du Serres.</note> that the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> having, upon
a difference betwixt him and the King, laid a Tax upon ſome of
the Provinces, by their owne conſent, to maintein his Army;
afterward, allured with fair promiſes, they inclined the <hi>Duke</hi> to
accord with the <hi>King,</hi> hoping to be eaſed of the Impoſition;
but they fell ſhort of their deſires; for, that which they had vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
impoſed upon Themſelves, was ſetled upon Them <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force</hi>
by the King, when he once had them in poſſeſſion: And ſo
that Tax, which was called the <hi>Gabel,</hi> continues upon them to
this very day, as a Token of their folly. Now, let not us flatter
our ſelves here in <hi>England,</hi> that we ſhall fare any better (in point
of <hi>Exciſe,</hi> or other payments) upon the <hi>Prince</hi>'s reſtitution.
If now we have <hi>Burthens,</hi> we muſt then look to have <hi>Furrows,</hi>
made upon our backs: If now we are (through neceſſity) put
to endure a few <hi>whips,</hi> we ſhall then (of ſet purpoſe) be chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with <hi>Scorpions.</hi> It is not an <hi>Exciſe,</hi> or an <hi>Army</hi> that we
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104589:28"/>
ſhall ſcape, but be viſited with whole Legions of <hi>forein Deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does,</hi>
which muſt be fed with greater Payments than ever, and
(God knowes) when we ſhall be rid of them, if the Prince ſettle
upon their ſhoulders. Conſider, how many hungry <hi>Scots</hi> gape
after this <hi>gude Land,</hi> who, with thoſe of other <hi>Nations,</hi> muſt be
Satisfied out of the Purſes of our own, whilſt thoſe that are their
<hi>Leaders</hi> will be gratified, with this, that, and the other Mans
Lands and poſſeſſions. And that this Inſinuation is no Fiction,
but well grounded upon Precedents out of our owne Hiſtories,
in the Practices of our Kings, may appear by the Proceedings of
the <hi>Conquerer;</hi> who being forced to extraordinary Courſes to
ſatisfie his forein Soldiery, made bold ſo frequently with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
of his Subjects, that the great Lords of the Kingdom, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it would come to their Turns at laſt to part with their Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſions,
by way of prevention, ſled out of the Land, ſome into
<hi>Scotland,</hi> ſome into <hi>Denmarke,</hi> and other Parts, <hi>to trie if by aide
from abroad, they might recover Themſelves and their Fortunes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
at home:</hi> But by this means they hapned to loſe all ſo
much the ſooner; for, miſcarrying in the Deſigne, their Eſtates
were poſſeſs'd, and their Offices ſupplied by the <hi>Norman</hi> Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites.
Thus alſo, King <hi>Stephen,</hi> himſelf being a <hi>Foreiner.</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
moſt upon forein Arms to preſerve him in poſſeſſion, was
conſtrained to take the ſame Courſe, for the ſatisfaction of his
<hi>forein Auxiliaries,</hi> which conſiſted moſt of <hi>Flemings</hi> and <hi>Picards,</hi>
whom he eſpecially truſted in his greateſt Actions, neglecting and
oppreſſing the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Thus did <hi>Henry</hi> the third alſo in his wars
with the <hi>Barons;</hi> againſt whom bringing in Foreiners, He, for
reward, inveſted them with others Lands and Honors, and laid
heavy Impoſitions beſides upon the whole Kingdom, to make
Them Satisfaction. And in thoſe variations of Fortune between
the two Houſes of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> as often as either of
Them had occaſion to make uſe of forein Arms to aſſert their
Titles, the Eſtates of the Adverſe Party, and the Purſes of the
People, were ſure to goe to wrack for the Pay of the Soldiery.
From hence then it appears, that if the Prince put himſelfe in
poſſeſſion by Arms, we ſhall be ſo far that way from any eaſe of
our burthens, that they will be doubled, and trebled, yea, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded
upon us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:104589:28"/>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The Prince's Confederation with the <hi>Scots,</hi> and our
<hi>Engliſh Presbyters,</hi> (were there no other Reaſon) might be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to terrifie any ingeniouſly minded People from giving
their aſſiſtance, be they <hi>Royaliſts,</hi> or not: For, if the Kirke be able
to bind the <hi>Prince</hi> to hard Conditions, and prove (like the Sons
of <hi>Zeruiah)</hi> too ſtrong for him, ſo that his <hi>Intereſt</hi> bow to theirs,
then in ſtead of a <hi>Regall</hi> (which is more tolerable) we muſt all
ſtoop to the intolerable yoke of a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Tyranny, that will
prove a plague upon the Conſciences, Bodies, and Purſes of this
free Nation. The <hi>Scots</hi> by this means will effect their Deſigne
upon us, by ſtretching their <hi>Covenant-union</hi> to an equality of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi>
with us in our owne Affairs: And the <hi>Engliſh-Grandees</hi> of
that Party will ſeat themſelves again in the <hi>Houſe,</hi> and exclude
all others, or elſe a New Parliament ſhall be called of Perſons of
their owne <hi>Faction;</hi> ſo that if they ſhould carry the day, all the
Comfort we ſhall have by caſting off the preſent Governers, will
be only that we ſhall have theſe furious <hi>Jockies</hi> for our Riders:
Things (perhaps) ſhall be in the old <hi>Statu quo,</hi> as they were
when the late King was at <hi>Holdenby,</hi> whoſe Son muſt then lay his
Scepter at the Foot-ſtole of the <hi>Kirke,</hi> or elſe they will reſtore
him by leiſure (as they did his Father) into the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty:
By which means we ſhould be brought again, as far as ever
we were, from a condition of Settlement, and the Common-wealth
reduced to Aſhes by endleſſe Cumbuſtions. On the other
Side, put caſe the <hi>Prince</hi> have the <hi>better end of the Staffe</hi> of the
<hi>Presbyters,</hi> (they relying upon his Courteſie, as well as the reſt of
the People) then, in caſe he carry the day, They, and All, are at
his mercy, and no Bar will be in the way to hinder him from an
Aſcent unto an <hi>unlimited Power:</hi> So that you plainly ſee, this
preſent Combination of <hi>Royalliſts</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> (which ſoever
of them be moſt prevalent) muſt of neceſſity put the Nation in
hazard between <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charybdis,</hi> that we cannot chuſe but
fall into one of the pernicious Gulphs, either of <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> or
<hi>Monarchicall</hi> Tyranny.</p>
                  <p>All theſe Particulars being ſeriouſly conſidered; how Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
it is in the firſt place that the <hi>Prince</hi> ſhould goe on with

muſt needs follow ſuch a Succeſſe (in caſe he prevaile) not only
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:104589:29"/>
to the Prejudice of any one Party, but of All, I may undeniably
conclude, that all miſtaken <hi>Royalliſts,</hi> as well as others, who live
now under the Protection of the <hi>preſent Government,</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
out of neceſſity, and in reſpect to their owne well-being
and benefit, to wiſh well thereunto, rather than proſecute the

which that I may the better doe, give me leave to trace them in
their <hi>Encroachments,</hi> from the firſt to the laſt, upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi>

King <hi>James</hi> who being a native <hi>Scot,</hi> out of love to his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
(or rather to himſelfe, that he might keep them quiet, by
ſtopping their mouths with the ſweet morſels of <hi>England)</hi> was
pleaſed to admit many of them into his Court, then into his
Councell, and to be partakers of Honours and Offices, equall to
the beſt of our <hi>Engliſh.</hi> His Son, the <hi>late King.</hi> knowing danger
might come of diſcontent out of the <hi>Northern</hi> Corner, followed
the ſame Courſe that his <hi>Father</hi> tooke, to oblige Them; holding
them in <hi>Penſion,</hi> giving acceſſe to all <hi>Beggars,</hi> with ſuch faire
Entertainment, that moſt of Them ſtaid here, and none returned
empty. This heaping of Favors upon Some, ſtirred up the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
and Emulation of others; who ſeeing themſelves neglected,
and not like to ſhare in any of theſe Enjoyments by the Favor of
the King, bethought them of an other way, to make Themſelves
as conſiderable as the reſt of their <hi>Country-men,</hi> and gain an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
with the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Seeing they could not thrive with the
<hi>Court,</hi> They would trie what They could doe without it.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon, being men of Power in their owne Country, They
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:104589:29"/>
became moſt Zealous Aſſertors of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Diſcipline
againſt the <hi>Epiſcopall,</hi> by which means they gained the Friendſhip
of all the <hi>Religious Party</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> then perſecuted by the
<hi>Biſhops,</hi> who were at <hi>Court</hi> the only <hi>Favourites:</hi> Hereupon, theſe
<hi>Leaders</hi> of the <hi>Scotiſh Presbyterians,</hi> beginning to grow active
and forward in eſtabliſhing their own <hi>Form</hi> at home, and alſo to
propagate it abroad by encouraging their Friends, gave ſuch an
Alarm to the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> that they (to croſſe the Deſigne) fell

                  </p>
                  <p>This happy Succeſſe wrought a very reverend opinion of them,

therein, we ſhall know by and by, by taking a view of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ever ſince, which are the moſt ſure Interpreters: Yet even
at that time,<note place="margin">See the <hi>grand Caſe of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,</hi> ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>ſome men had their eyes in their heads, and many Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
were made at divers Expreſſions in the</hi> Covenant, <hi>and many
Deſires for explanation of ſome Articles more fully.</hi> But the <hi>Scots</hi>
ſtanding ſtiffe upon their owne Terms, and no Conjunction like
to be obtained without the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and the neceſſity of the
Parliaments Affairs admitting no delay, we were glad to take it
as it was offered, without further queſtion or Demurrer.</p>
                  <p>It was no ſooner taken here at <hi>London,</hi> but immediately every
one began to make his Advantage (through the multitude and
ambiguity of Expreſſions) and by it to promote his ſeverall <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt;</hi>
as if it had been made to engage unto a particular Party,
not to unite two Nations in a common Intereſt. But above all
the <hi>Scots,</hi> having had the honor of this Invention, conceived
themſelves much injured by any, that denyed them the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of making an Interpretation; and in matter of Religion,
urged their owne Diſcipline as the only Patern to Reform the
Church by; and their Plea had been fair enough out of the
Covenant, could they have proved it to be <hi>[according to the
word of God;]</hi> which Clauſe was moſt luckily inſerted. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all the Reaſons to the Contrary, the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Module
was ſtill preſſed: The <hi>Scot</hi> was willing to ride, and having (as he
thought) the <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> faſt bridled with a <hi>Covenant,</hi> he began
to ſwitch and ſpur. The <hi>Throne of the Kirke</hi> was the <hi>Stalking-horſe</hi>
to catch <hi>geeſe;</hi> and if that could have been ſetled, then there
had been no denying Them whatſoever they would ask; They
would have ſeated themſelves ſurely in this fat Soile; There
would have been no removing them out of our Councels, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the neceſſity of our Affaires had made them Members and
Partakers. For, had the <hi>Kirk-Intereſt</hi> been once confirmed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us, then by vertue of that Authority which they uſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll
the <hi>Civill</hi> power, the Parliament muſt have been ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient
to all their ends. And ſince it would have concerned the
<hi>Engliſh Clergy</hi> (to make their Party ſtrong, and maintein Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondencies
for their owne preſervation) to have gratified
their <hi>Scotiſh Founders</hi> in all their Deſires, the <hi>Scots</hi> might eaſily
have tranſlated the <hi>Covenant-union</hi> to as good as an abſolute
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104589:30"/>
                     <hi>Nationall union,</hi> by gaining a <hi>Joynt-Intereſt</hi> with us in our Affairs
for ever, and conſequently, in all the Profits, great Offices, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
and Concernments of this Nation.</p>
                  <p>Now, whether this were their Deſigne or not in the Covenant
<hi>ab origine,</hi> I ſhall not determine; but let it be judged by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent
behaviour here among us, after they were admitted to our
Counſells: and therefore in the next place I ſhall examine their
Proceedings, which moſt evidently repreſent them in their Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
—It ſufficed them not; after they were come in, that
they had an equall Power with us in publique Affairs, in the
Committee of both Kingdoms at <hi>Derby</hi>-houſe (which was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
allowed them for a time, ſo far as concerned the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
cauſe of both Nations, in proſecuting the war) but driving
a Powerfull Party in both <hi>Houſes,</hi> They tooke upon them to
meddle with matters relating to the future Peace and Settlement
of this Nation, diſtinct from their owne, and to provide for an
equall Intereſt with us therein. The firſt moſt notable Evidence
of this (though there had been many before) was diſcovered at
the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge</hi>-Treaty, where Propoſitions of both Houſes for
Peace being preſented to the King, it was found the <hi>Scots</hi> had ſo
far Provided for Themſelves by their Party in the <hi>Houſes,</hi> That
in time to come, the ordering of the <hi>Engliſh Militia,</hi> the Power
of making War and Peace, and all other Prerogatives of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
were to be adminiſtred by a proportionable number of
<hi>Scots,</hi> as well as <hi>Engliſh:</hi> A thing ſo ridiculous, and an Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſo palpable, that the King Himſelf, in one of His Anſwers,
took notice of it, and ſaid, He <hi>was not ſo much an Enemy to the
Engliſh Nation, as to ſigne thoſe Propoſitions;</hi> or ſomewhat (I am
ſure) to this Purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond evidence or diſcovery of their Encroachments was
made, upon their delivering in divers Papers to the Parliament,
at ſeverall times, wherein they diſputed their Claim, and ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their <hi>Logick</hi> upon the Letter of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> to prove an
<hi>Intereſt</hi> in diſpoſall of matters meerly relating to our welfare;
which they re-inforced afterwards with new Recruits of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when the King came into their Army.</p>
                  <p>But not knowing well how to maintaine their Arguments,
They were contented for that time, to quit Them and their
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:104589:31"/>
King too, upon ſuch Terms, as are notorious to all the world;
who being at length reduced under the Power of the Parliament
and Army, Propoſitions of Peace were ſent to him at <hi>Hampton</hi>-Court,
wherein no ſuch Proviſion being made for the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
as was in thoſe at <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge,</hi> their Commiſſioners here
proteſted againſt them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> accuſed the Parliament of Breach of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and complained highly in one of their <hi>Declarations</hi> that
they ſhould be ſo neglected. This may ſerve as a <hi>third evidence</hi>
of their <hi>Covenant-deſigne</hi> of Encroachment; whereto may be
added one more, when the King was at <hi>Carisbrooke</hi> Caſtle,
whither the Commiſſioners of Parliament were no ſooner arived
with <hi>Propoſitions</hi> againe, but the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners were at
hand, and for the ſame reaſon proteſted furiouſly againſt Them.
By which inſolent demeanors and expreſſions, from time to
time, and crying up the <hi>Covenant</hi> for their defence, it is clear
enough what their Intentions were when they urged it upon us,
and that notwithſtanding all the ſpecious Pretences of <hi>brotherly
Love,</hi> their Deſigne in it hitherto hath beene, onely to ſcrue
themſelves into an equall Intereſt with us in this Nation.</p>
                  <p>Having ſmelt out their <hi>Project</hi> thus farre, give me leave
to trace them on to the end, as briefly as may be. The <hi>Royall
Party</hi> being totally ſuppreſſed, and ſo no further occaſion to
make uſe of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Army, the Parliament, with ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
made ſhift to ſend them home into their own Kingdome:
But being defeated of their Aims and expectations, they could
not ſo reſt; having failed of their ends by pretending for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
they reſolved next to try what they could do upon the
<hi>Kings</hi> Score, and ſo the <hi>Grandees</hi> turn'd the <hi>Tables,</hi> in hope of
an <hi>After-game,</hi> by cloſing with <hi>Hamilton</hi> upon the <hi>Royall Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt;</hi>
not doubting but if they gained the day this way, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
their Travels with much more Advantage. The <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
like a <hi>noſe of wax,</hi> apt to be turned any way, ſerved this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize
every jot as well as the former, though the Deſigne
were different from what it was, the <hi>great ones</hi> not caring much
what became of the <hi>Kirk Intereſt,</hi> ſince they had agreed for the
ſecurity of their owne; which muſt needs have been very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable,
if they could have redeemed the King, and reſtored
him into the condition of an abſolute <hi>Monarch.</hi> Therefore the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104589:31"/>
                     <hi>Kirk</hi> ſeeing themſelves left thus in the <hi>Lurch,</hi> thundered out their
Curſes amaine upon that <hi>Hypocriticall Engagement,</hi> as deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
to the <hi>Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Grandees</hi> being at a loſſe in this likewiſe upon <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s
Defeat, and followed home to their owne dores by the
brave <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, were glad to cry <hi>Peccavi</hi> to the <hi>Kirk,</hi> and
alſo to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commanders, whom they diſmiſſed with
many promiſes of fair Carriage for the future. Within a while
after, a new dore of hope being opened to them by the ſuppoſed
Succeſſion of the late Kings <hi>Son,</hi> They to ingratiate with him,
proclaime him their King; and here the <hi>Grandees</hi> and the <hi>Kirk</hi>
joyning hands againe, become friends, and offer their Service
for his reſtitution, upon Terms of the <hi>Covenant;</hi> which is their
<hi>Plea</hi> now at this very day: So that the <hi>Covenant,</hi> which was
pretended to be framed at firſt, for the preſervation of this <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
and the <hi>Liberties</hi> of the People, againſt the uſurpations
of <hi>regall Power,</hi> is; now that the <hi>Scots</hi> can ſerve their <hi>deſigne</hi> no
longer that way, become the Ground of their preſent Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
with the <hi>Prince,</hi> and their Presbyterian Brethren in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
for the deſtruction of our <hi>Liberties;</hi> being reſolved this
way, ſince they have failed in all the reſt, to trie whether they
can accompliſh their profane Projects through the <hi>Covenant,</hi> by
inſinuating themſelves into places of Honour, Profit, and Power,
that they may domineere in the poſſeſſions, as their <hi>Phariſaicall
Prieſts</hi> would over the Conſciences of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus having made way, in diſcovering what the deſigne of the
<hi>Scots</hi> ever hath beene, and is at this Inſtant, under the faire Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> certainly, no man that is maſter of an
<hi>Engliſh</hi> ſpirit, but will abhorre the Hypocriticall pretences and
Encroachments of that perfideous Nation. And therefore now
that all men may beware how they be drawne into an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with them, I ſhall (according to my way) manifeſt firſt, the
<hi>Improbability</hi> of their Succeſſe, and then the <hi>Inconveniences</hi>
which muſt neceſſarily follow, in caſe their deſigne be ſucceſſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
effected.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to the <hi>Improbability</hi> of Succeſſe, conſider by way of
Compariſon, the great difference between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and
<hi>Scotiſh</hi> Soldiery. Ours are heightned with extraordinary Pay,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:104589:32"/>
bravely accompliſhed, ſtrong Horſe, well diſciplin'd, veterane
Soldiers, better Spirited by reaſon of a more generous educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and to all theſe add the advantage of being <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi>
and the Reputation of having been ſo long <hi>victorious;</hi> let theſe
conſiderations be laid in the balance againſt the <hi>Scots;</hi> freſh men
(for the main) newly raiſed, a People of farre leſſe generous
Soules, poor in Body, Pay, and other Accommodations, ſave
what they have purchaſed by proguing here in <hi>England.</hi> Judge
then in reaſon what theſe are able to doe againſt ſo brave an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
that contemns and ſcorns Them, as having beaten them
with a handfull (in compariſon of their numbers) home to their
owne dores; an Army, that to all worldly Advantages, hath
hitherto had a ſpeciall Protection from Heaven, God having
Sealed them for his owne by many miraculous victories and
Succeſſes, to the wonder of the whole world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> conſider that our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army are all of a Nation,
Natives, and unanimous eſpecially upon the appearance of any
<hi>Invaders;</hi> whereas the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> will be made up of divers Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>Royaliſts</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> that com in purſuance of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ends; which (for the time that they continue together)
muſt needs be a cauſe of many Confuſions and partialities of
Counſells, to the prejudice of their Enterpriſes and Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
a ſpring of perpetuall Emulations, that will ſoone untwiſt
the Confederacy; ſo that in ſhort time they muſt fall aſunder
like a <hi>Rope of Sand,</hi> and the private Soldiery be diſpoſed to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
thoughts of ſome new Engagement, to the ruine of the
firſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We ſhall not only be provided for them here, if
they dare be ſo unworthy as to invade us; but 'tis like this
<hi>Common-wealth</hi> may find work for them at home, and (to cure
their madneſſe) divert the humour with <hi>Phlebotomie,</hi> by way of
<hi>Revulſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is like they will be farre from running much ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
to gain Succeſſe unto the Deſigne. For, if they provr a little
unfortunate, the humour will alter; one good beating will
make them underſtand, there is another way of Intereſt and
Thriving, than under the wings of <hi>Royalty.</hi> It may chance to
make them remember (becauſe they cannot forget) how long
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104589:32"/>
they have lived without a King in <hi>Scotland,</hi> while the <hi>Grandees</hi>
and the <hi>Kirk</hi> did all; and that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have dealt more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly
to have <hi>no King,</hi> than a Presbyterian <hi>Mock-King.</hi>
One <hi>Rout</hi> (with this conſideration) puts them preſently into
the humour of a <hi>Republique,</hi> as well as <hi>England.</hi> And then they
will have no more work to doe, but to raiſe the <hi>Market,</hi> and
get <hi>Chap men</hi> for their <hi>King</hi> to put him off handſomly, that
they may pay their Army, and goe home again like <hi>Scots.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the <hi>Scots</hi> having no juſt Ground of a Warre againſt
<hi>England,</hi> can hardly be proſperous in the Attempt. The <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
can be none, being extinct, as I have proved in the former
part of this <hi>Treatiſe;</hi> beſides I ſhall adde one Reaſon more:
It cannot in common ſenſe be ſuppoſed to have been intended
as an <hi>eternall</hi> obligation, binding both Nations for ever, or to
bind the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation with an implicite Faith, to whatſoever
the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhould expound to be righteous and neceſſary, to be
done here for ever by way of Government. But it appeares
intended onely for a certain time, for the proſecution of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Ends which were common to both Nations as Affaires
then ſtood; and therefore being of a tranſient nature, becauſe
thoſe Ends (by the alteration of Time, and other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances)
are found either not poſſible or inconvenient, the
obligation expires of it ſelf. This being the ſtate of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
neither the <hi>Scots,</hi> nor any other Party can found a
Warre upon it in Reaſon or Juſtice. If ſo, then having no other
Ground for a Warre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but Covetuouſneſſe, Emulation and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
which (as I ſhewed in the <hi>Preamble</hi> of this Chapter)
have been cloaked under the <hi>Covenant,</hi> in all their Ingagements,
the hand of Heaven will aſſuredly be againſt them for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian

                  <p>To theſe Examples out of profane Hiſtory, let me adde a
few out of the Sacred. You may read 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 15. how <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib,</hi>
the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> mad an impious invaſive War againſt
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> King of <hi>Judah;</hi> the conſequence whereof was the
Confuſion of his Army, and Revenge followed him to his own
home ſo cloſe at the heels, that it was executed upon him by his
owne Sons, while he was at his ſuperſtitious devotion, in the
midſt of his Idols. Nor have wicked Princes onely beene puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for invading the good, but you may read alſo that the good
have had ill Succeſſe in invading the bad.<note place="margin">2 Chron. 35.</note> Thus good <hi>Joſiah,</hi> a
moſt religious Prince, warring without cauſe againſt <hi>Pharaoh
Nicho</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> received his deaths wound at <hi>Megiddo,</hi>
and after his death, the ſame King <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to right himſelf of
the Injury done him by <hi>Joſiah</hi> waged Warre, and by Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
ſubduing the Land, made the whole Nation Tributary,
and took King <hi>Jehoahaz,</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> and carryed him
Priſoner into <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:104589:33"/>
Alſo, another good King of <hi>Judah,</hi> by name, <hi>Amaziah,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
<hi>Jehoaſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Kings 14.</note> a wicked King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> without cauſe, to Battel,
was utterly Routed, the City of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> taken, the Walls
demoliſhed, the Temple ſpoiled, and <hi>Amaziah</hi> himſelf carried
away Priſoner, to ſhew how much the Lord of Hoſts, and God
of Battell, it displeaſed with unjuſt Wars, that he will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper
them, though made by his own People againſt the wicked
that are his Enemies.</p>
                  <p>But there is one example more, which (me thinks) is very
pertinent to our purpoſe;<note place="margin">2 Sam. Chap. 2, 3, &amp; 4.</note> and that is of <hi>Iſhboſheth,</hi> the Son of
King <hi>Saul,</hi> who laying claim to the Kingdome after his Father,
by prerogative of Succeſſion, made War againſt <hi>David,</hi> who
was choſen King by Gods owne appointment: But to ſhew that
<hi>Hereditary Succeſſion</hi> is no Plea to juſtifie a Warre againſt the
Powers that are ordained by him, he placed marks of diſpleaſure
againſt all that took part with <hi>Iſhboſheth,</hi> ſo that in the end <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſheth</hi>
had his Head ſtrook off by ſome Commanders of his
own Party, and brought to <hi>David.</hi> Now, I leave this unto thoſe
that liſt, to make the Application: And withall, they may doe
well to conſider how the <hi>Spaniard</hi> proſpered in 88. in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion
againſt <hi>England;</hi> how ill he hath thrived ever in his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
againſt the <hi>Hollander:</hi> And as for the <hi>Scots,</hi> I ſuppoſe,
that as it concerns them to conſider the ſad example of the late
<hi>Hamiltonian</hi> Invaſion; ſo they and their Adherents may learn
from all theſe together, That God will never proſper them, if
they proceed in their unrighteous Combination.</p>
                  <p>Having ſhewn the Improbability of the <hi>Scots</hi> ſucceſſe, I ſhall
in the next place diſcover the great Inconveniences and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
that our Nation muſt needs undergoe, in caſe it ſhould
happen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> It being evident, that their deſigne in urging the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
upon us, hath been to inſinuate themſelves into an equall
<hi>Intereſt</hi> with us in our own Nation, it is to be ſuppoſed, that
having hitherto been defeated of their long-expected Prey, they
come now to proſecute it with the greater appetite: And it is
to be preſumed they will not ſerve the King with the <hi>Covenant,</hi>
at an eaſier rate than they intended it ſhould have coſt the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:104589:34"/>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is to be feared, this ſo much deſired <hi>Intereſt</hi> of
theirs may (if opportunities fall out right for their Turns) be
driven on farther by the <hi>Sword,</hi> than yet we are aware of. A
<hi>Nationall <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> hath been whiſper'd often among them hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and there's no doubt but they will bid high for it, if ever
they have occaſion; And then it muſt needs be a very fine world,
when we are confounded with a Miſcelany of <hi>Scotiſh</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh;</hi>
when <hi>Scots</hi> ſhall be Competitors with us in point of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,
vie wealth with us in our own Poſſeſſions, Honours, and
Dignities; and either impoſe new Lawes upon us, or alter the
Old, as may make moſt for their Advantage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That theſe things may be, is probable enough, ſince
their <hi>King</hi> having no other rewards to give them, it is impoſſible
he ſhould ſatisfie the <hi>Grandees</hi> and Leaders any other way, than
by promiſing large acceſſions of Intereſt, with other mens Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
and Poſſeſſions; even thoſe men's (perhaps) that are the
<hi>Moderate Sort</hi> of Tranſgreſſors; For, in ſuch Caſes it is uſuall
to ſtretch all Offences upon the Wrack, to ſupply the neceſſities
of the <hi>Conquerour;</hi> and then if this happen, 'tis like a <hi>Scotch
Covenanters</hi> ſtomack, will allow no diſtinction, betwixt <hi>Presbyter</hi>
and <hi>Independent,</hi> but may digeſt the eſtate of an <hi>Engliſh Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanter</hi>
without ſo much as a <hi>Scruple</hi> of Regret, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it is a very great wonder, ſince the preſent <hi>Stage-play</hi>
of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and the <hi>Actors</hi> are brought on this ſide the
Curtain, and we know what they are through all their diſguiſe,
and what they aime at, That yet many of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould be
ſo ſtupid, as to be led away with their Cheates and Pretences for
a <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Reformation:</hi> Alſo, ſince it is evident, that their
chief Leaders and Sticklers gape onely after Profit and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and (according to the Cuſtome of all Forreiners in Arms)
will make no difference between Friend and Foe, ſo they may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
their covetous and ambitious Ends; ſince the whole People
likewiſe muſt of neceſſity be haraſed with innumerable Taxes,
to pay the rabble of their Souldiery; certainly, no true <hi>Engliſh</hi>
heart can be ſo degenerous, as to forward or countenance them,
in their invading this Nation.</p>
                  <p>Now, for a Concluſion to the whole; that theſe Particulars
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:104589:34"/>
may appeare more ſolid then mere Inſinuations, give me leave
to confirme them by many Authentick examples; it being an
ordinary Caſe in the world, That<note n="*" place="margin">Ab iſtis exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citibus, quos de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendendi ſui causâ attraxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, evertuntur.</note> Commonwealths and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes

                  <p>And now I would faine know of the Admirers of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi>

what aſſurance they can have, that they ſhall not ſerve us
the ſame ſauce, as their Anceſtors did the <hi>Picts,</hi> and as ours did

of the whole, by the <hi>Power of the Sword.</hi> By reaſon of
this neceſſary and magnanimous Act, it is, that they have made
Themſelves ſo many Enemies to the <hi>Presbyterian Party:</hi> For,
the <hi>Scots,</hi> being defeated of their <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt, the <hi>Secluded
Members</hi> of their Hopes and Priviledges, and the <hi>Clergie</hi> of their
<hi>Kirk-domination,</hi> incline all immediately to face about to the
<hi>Prince,</hi> and to hedge in him and his Intereſt with their owne, as
well as they can, in hope of private Revenge and a Recovery,
without any regard at all to the good and peace of the Publique.
Then <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> if they prevaile, ye will be but in the old poſture
again, As You WERE; yea, and far worſe than you were, ſince
all thoſe Church-uſurpations which were then but in deſigne,
muſt needs be confirm'd by a new alteration.</p>
                  <p>For this Cauſe it is, there are ſo many <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Juglings in
private, ſuch Murmurings abroad, and ſo many Mutinies in the
<hi>Pulpit;</hi> ſuch wel-acted Lamentations for the glory of the <hi>Kirke,</hi>
and the loſſe of their <hi>Diana,</hi> that every <hi>Prayer</hi> is a <hi>Stratagem,</hi>
moſt <hi>Sermons</hi> meer <hi>Plots</hi> againſt the State, and upon their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.
Thus the Nature of their Deſigne being diſcovered, give
me leave in the next place to manifeſt the Vanity of their Hopes,
that if men will not forbeare for ſhame of its hypocriſie, they
may yet, in conſideration of the many ſad Conſequents which

                     <head>As to the Improbability of their Succeſſe,</head>
                     <p>Firſt, our <hi>Engliſh Presbyterians</hi> are very inconſiderable now
in <hi>England,</hi> becauſe above three Parts in four are fallen off, ſince
they were able to ſee through the Pretences of the <hi>Grandees</hi>
of their Party, ſo that the ſmall Remainder can doe little of

Reed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> As their Party is but ſmall of its Self; ſo there is
ſmall likelyhood of an Increaſe, becauſe all the Reſt of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are Oppoſite to them and their waies, being either <hi>Common-wealths-men,</hi>

to draw in the <hi>Royall Party</hi> to their own, yet it can never be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
by reaſon that the old <hi>Antipathie</hi> will revive upon every
little occaſion. For, the <hi>Royalliſts</hi> looke upon them ſtill, as the
Authors of their Miſery; and the <hi>Prince</hi> (who is Head of that
Party) though He may feed Them with fair Promiſes, can never
cordially imbrace them, being the old Enemies of his Family:
Nor will he count them any whit the leſſe guilty for their hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall
proteſting againſt the Death of his <hi>Father;</hi> For, They
reduced him <hi>Diminutione Capitis,</hi> into the condition of a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
They ſpoil'd him as a <hi>King,</hi> before others executed him

were more courteous in ſending him to an heavenly. In ſhort, I

that the Prince could forget old Injuries, and that the neceſſities
of the chiefe of his Party ſhould bring down their Stomacks to
a compliance with <hi>Presbyterie;</hi> yet the main Body of that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

                     <p>But to illuſtrate this a little, give me leave to cloſe up this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
with a notable example—It hapned that <hi>Clearchus,</hi>

                        </note>
the Tyrant of <hi>Heraclea,</hi> was by a Conſpiracy of the <hi>Grandees</hi>
driven out of his Dominions, they hoping when he was gone
to have all power in their owne hands; but there ſtarted up a
Party of the People, which prevented them, and ſetled the State
in a condition of Liberty and Freedome. Hereupon, the <hi>Grandees,</hi>
in diſdain and revenge againſt this new Party, conſpired againſt
the Common-wealth, and brought back <hi>Clearchus</hi> into poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The <hi>Tyrant</hi> being thus reſtored, inſtead of gratifying them
that had a hand in his reſtitution, conſulted to ſatisfie both
his owne Revenge upon them, for having oppoſed him at
firſt, and alſo the diſcontents of the People againſt them, for
their having deprived them of their late Liberty: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the reward they received for bringing him back was, that
he Sentenced them all to a moſt ſhamefull Execution. This is

of King <hi>James,</hi> when the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> ruling all as

is only this; That they would not have a <hi>King</hi> ſo much as in

                  <p>In the mean time, that you may know what They are, and
how they came to be diſtinguiſhed by this Title, give me leave to
trace Them from their Originall, and manifeſt how they were
divided in Affection from the <hi>Parliament;</hi> which appears to be
occaſioned only by a meer misinterpretation or miſtake of ſome
Paſſages in divers <hi>Declarations</hi> of the <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Army</hi>
touching the <hi>Liberties of the People;</hi> wherein they profeſſed, <hi>That
the compleat Settlement of the Liberties and Peace of the Nation is
that bleſſing of God, than which, of all worldly things, nothing is more
dear and precious in their Thoughts.</hi> From this, and the like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
a certain Sort of men, of buſie parts, and that have a
mind to ſeem Sombody, immediatly tooke upon them to frame
ſuch Comments, and <hi>Chimaera</hi>'s of Liberty, as might fit their own
Ends and Phantſies; And in time, diſſeminated ſuch ſtrange Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of pretended <hi>Freedome,</hi> among the common Sort of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery
and People; that it became evident to all the world, they
ſought not <hi>Liberty</hi> but <hi>Licentiouſneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the firſt time that they began to appear conſiderable in
view, was in the year 1647, when that memorable conteſt hapned
betwixt the Army, and the <hi>corrupt Party</hi> then prevalent, in both
<hi>Houſes</hi> and the <hi>City:</hi> At which time, though they did good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
in helping to reduce the one, and purge the other; yet no
ſooner had the Parliament recovered it Self into a State of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
and Freedom, and begun to act in ſuch a way, as they
conceived neceſſary to eſtabliſh the liberties of the Nation, but
theſe men made bold to carp at their Proceedings, and crie out
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:104589:40"/>
againſt them and the ſuperior Officers of the Army, as perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and betrayers of the <hi>publique Intereſt;</hi> becauſe Themſelves
(a hot headed Rabble, and the meaneſt of the People) might not
have it ſetled after their own humor.</p>
                  <p>From whence it appears, the firſt Cauſe of the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Parliament and Them, was their bold and impudent
behaviour, in preſuming to direct their wiſdome what to doe,
and taking upon them, <hi>Dictator</hi>-like, to define what is <hi>Liberty,</hi>
and what not, and how it ought to be eſtabliſhed; as if Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

                  <p>Yet it is a wonder to ſee, how lightly men prize this invalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Jewell of <hi>Liberty,</hi> which hath coſt the Common-wealth ſo

                     <hi>Florentine</hi>'s ſubtile diſcourſes upon <hi>Livy;</hi>
who compares ſuch as have been educated under a <hi>Monarchy</hi>

alll their lives in a Den, where they ſeem to live in as much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,

likewiſe, by education and Cuſtome from the <hi>Cradle,</hi> even upon
men that are endued with reaſonable Souls, that they chuſe to
live in thoſe Places and Cuſtomes of government, under which
they have been bred, rather than ſubmit to better, which might
make more for their Content and Advantage. Hence it is, that
thoſe poore Slaves under the <hi>Turk, Perſian, Tartar, Muſcovite,

they admire their own condition above all others, and (like the

                  <p>But beſides <hi>education</hi> and <hi>cuſtom,</hi> under another <hi>Form,</hi> there is

by luxurious Courſes, when a Nation is even ſwallowed up with

become the more eaſily inſlaved unto the Luſts of another. The

long time, that no Relations or Conſiderations whatſoever
of former merits, could availe with them to ſpare thoſe that

found guilty of a conſpiracy, to bring back the <hi>Tarquinian</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
They condemned them to death, and their own <hi>Father</hi>
was as forward as any, to bring them to Execution: So the
famous <hi>Manlius</hi> likewiſe, to whom <hi>Rome</hi> owed both her ſelfe
and <hi>Liberty,</hi> being by him preſerved againſt the <hi>Galls,</hi> in the

his after-Intent to ſurprize their <hi>Liberty,</hi> thrown headlong
down the <hi>Tarpeian</hi> Rock, within view of the <hi>Capitoll</hi> which he
had ſo nobly defended. By which Actions you may perceive,
that when <hi>Rome</hi> was in its pure eſtate, vertue begat a deſire of
Liberty, and this deſire begat in them an extraordinary Courage
and Reſolution to defend it; which three walked a long time
hand in hand together, and were the Cauſes, that the firſt Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

their <hi>Liberty,</hi> and an <hi>Empire</hi> over the world; being
ſoftned in their manners, and conquered by their vices whoſe
Dominions they had conquered, they ſoon bowed under the

yoke of <hi>Imperiall Tyranny;</hi> And though there appeared after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſome ſparks of ancient courage and love of liberty among
Them, when They took off <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelfe, <hi>Caligula, Nero,</hi>
and in the end rid Themſelves quite of that Tyrannicall Stock

                  <p>But one great Argument of exception (I perceive among

and that it is not agreeable to the Word of God. To

of opinions in matter of Religion could never be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

they ſeverely puniſh ſuch as offer to diſturb their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours

they ſuffer not that Religion to be evill ſpoken of, which is
publiquely profeſſed by the <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>State:</hi> whereby it is
implyed, that a <hi>Toleration</hi> of different opinions in Religion,
can be no prejudice to the Peace of a Nation, ſo long as
theſe Rules are obſerved; but rather a grand Preſervative of
publique Quiet; whereas perſecutions for matter of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
have ever been all the world over the great Incentives of
Sedition. And ſince it is of unavoidable neceſſity, that (while
the world ſtands) there will be diviſions of Opinion, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
ſuch a courſe muſt needs be moſt rationall, which ſhall
provide waies of remedy againſt ſuch Inconveniences as may
follow them, rather than Inventions of Torture and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to thwart and ſtifle Them; becauſe the <hi>understandings</hi> of
men can no more be compelled than their <hi>Wills,</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
what they like not. So that from hence it appears
plainly, the great pretenders of <hi>Nationall <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
thoſe high imperious <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity-mongers,</hi> that would
have men take meaſure of all Opinions by their own, are the

or <hi>voluntarily</hi> by their own conſent. Both theſe wayes they
are conceived to quit their own power, and transfer it irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably
to him (or them) that take them into protection. And
though ſuch as are ſubdued by Arms loſe their power by <hi>force,</hi>
yet being neceſſitated to yeeld ſubmiſſion to the <hi>Victor,</hi> he is
ſuppoſed to rule over them by their own <hi>conſent.</hi> Moreover, it
is to be obſerved, that in this caſe, not all thoſe which yeeld to
the conditions of an unjuſt peace impoſed by the enemies, but
thoſe only that bare Arms, are underſtood to be the <hi>Conquered
Party:</hi> And becauſe the reſt that never bare Armes are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained

a Compact or Agreement (though it ſeem ſomewhat unjuſt)

Tribute? Was he a good and lawfull Prince? Or, was he
not rather a cruell <hi>Tyrant,</hi> both in the uſurpation, and exerciſe
of his Power? It was <hi>Tiberius</hi> that then reigned, who by the
practiſes of his Mother, poſſeſſed himſelfe of the <hi>Empire,</hi> to
which he had no right, and ſecured it by the ſubtile ſleights
and wickedneſſe of a woman, while the right Heire was exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
Having invaded the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> as a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> as a <hi>Tyrant</hi>
he ruled; yet ſince <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf ſo freely and willingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
himſelf, did he not in ſo doing ſignifie by the Doctrine
which he delivered, and commanded his Diſciples to publiſh
to all Nations, That he deſired not any change of that form
of Government, which was then eſtabliſhed? And did not his
Apoſtles delare to their Succeſſors, and recommend unto the
people, the very ſame Doctrin which they received from their
Lord and Maſter? <hi>Peter,</hi> in that his Epiſtle generall, which he
wrote to the Jewes, ſcattered in all Nations, cammanded them
to ſubmit to <hi>every Ordinance of Man;</hi> by which (according
to the beſt interpretation) is meant all Principality, or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy
whatſoever. To whom accords <hi>Paul</hi> in his 13. to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
where, according to the old <hi>Greek</hi> Copies, we read,
<hi>[To all ſuper-eminent Powers]</hi> and in the old Latin <hi>[Be ye
ſubject to all higher Powers]</hi> as it is read alſo by <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and
<hi>Ambroſe</hi> in their Commentaries. And whereas <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith,
<hi>[To every ordinance of man]</hi> it is meant to every Power which
is ſet over men, to all Magiſtrates, as well as to Kings, and
whereas he ſaith, <hi>to the King as ſuper-eminent,</hi> it is to be noted,
that Epiſtle was written from <hi>Babylon;</hi> and ſo the ſubjection
muſt be meant then of the King of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> to whom he
willed the Chriſtians in the Provinces of that Countrey to be
ſubject; and whereas it was ſuper-ſcribed to the converted
<hi>Jewes</hi> that dwelt in <hi>Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynia,</hi>
thoſe things ſpoken by <hi>Peter,</hi> may be meant likewiſe of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:104589:54"/>
the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour. And who was <hi>Emporour</hi> at that time but
<hi>Nero?</hi> no ordinary Tyrant, but the moſt notorious cruell Tyrant
in the world: ſo that in all times ſince his name hath been made
uſe of, by all Nations, as an ordinary Appellation for the worſt
of <hi>Tyrants.</hi> But whether it were to the King of the <hi>Parthians,</hi>
or to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, or whatſoever <hi>Tyrant</hi> beſides, <hi>Peter</hi>
affirms there is a debt of Subjection due unto them from the
People. So likewiſe doth <hi>Paul,</hi> in his fore-mentioned Chapter
to the Romans, and gives the reaſon, why we ſhould ſubmit to
all ſupereminent Powers;<note place="margin">Non eſſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testatem niſi à Deo.</note> becauſe <hi>There is no Power but of God;
the Powers that are, are ordained of God:</hi> And from thence he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,

               <hi>reſiſts the Ordinance of God, and
they that reſiſt ſhall receive damnation.</hi> Laſtly, he ſaith, ſubjection
muſt be yielded, not only for fear of the anger of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
but alſo for <hi>Conſcience ſake:</hi> As if we could not preſerve
a Conſcience pure and upright before God, except we paid the

               <hi>Pag.</hi> 113. <hi>Paul</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> ch. 2. exhorts that
<hi>Prayers and Supplications be made for all that are in Authority,
that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty;</hi>
becauſe godlineſſe and honeſty cannot well ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
peace and tranquillity; and there can be no peace and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe
without the ſafety of our Governers. But what were
thoſe Governers which the Apoſtle commanded us to pray for?
Certainly, they were <hi>Tyrants</hi> by Uſurpation, that ruled in a
tyrannicall manner, haters of the true Religion, Perſecutors and
Idolaters. Yet this was the Rule, this the Law, this the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.
And, as he obſerves, <hi>Pag.</hi> 197. <hi>Christ</hi> himſelf was
content to be born, to live and pay obedience, to acknowledge
their Authority in matter of Tribute and Judicature, and at laſt
to be condemned injuriouſly, and ſuffer death moſt ſhamefully,
under a tyrannical uſurped Government.—Much more he
hath to the ſame purpoſe; but let this ſuffice out of one of their
own <hi>Oralces,</hi> to ſhew; That if the preſent power were uſurp't,
(as our <hi>Antagoniſts</hi> would ſuppoſe, though as yet they never

guilt of that <hi>Treaſon,</hi> wherein they muſt needs involve Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,

when it cometh to paſſe, that the Power of a Common-wealth or

            <p>Theſe things conſidered,<note place="margin">Sect. 11.</note> it will eaſily appear, that under the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Power of a Chriſtian Common-wealth, there is no danger
of Damnation from ſimple Obedience to human Laws: For, in
that the Soveraign alloweth Christianity, no man is compelled to
renounce that Faith, which is enough for his Salvation, that is to
ſay, the Fundamentall Points. And for other Points, ſeeing they
are not neceſſary to Salvation, if we conform our actions to the
Laws, we do not only what we are allowed, but alſo what we are
commanded by the Law of Nature, which is the moral Law taught
by our Saviour himſelf. And it is part of that Obedience which
muſt concur to our Salvation.</p>

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:104589:56"/>
his Conſcience, is ſin; yet the Obedience in theſe Caſes is
neither ſin, nor againſt the Conſcience. For, the <hi>Conſcience</hi> being
nothing elſe but a mans ſetled Judgement, and Opinion, when his
Right of Judging is once transferred to another, that which ſhall
be commanded, is no leſſe his Judgment, than the Judgment of that
other. So that in obedience to Laws, a man doth ſtill according to
his own Conſcience, but not his private Conſcience. And whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is done contrary to private Conſcience, is then a ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the
Laws have left him to his own Liberty, and never elſe.</p>
