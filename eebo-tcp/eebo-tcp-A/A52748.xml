            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

with an impartiall eye upon the Affairs
of this <hi>new Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon, beginning Å¿eriouÅ¿ly to
Å¿earch into the nature of it, with the
many <hi>Pleas</hi> and <hi>Objections</hi> made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t
it; And Å¿uppoÅ¿ing thoÅ¿e learned
men who wrote before theÅ¿e Times,
were moÅ¿t likely to Å¿peak truth, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
un-intereÅ¿ted in our Affairs, and
un-concerned in the ControverÅ¿ie, I
took a view of their ReaÅ¿ons and Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and from thence made Å¿o many
Collections, that putting them in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and comparing all together, they
<pb facs="tcp:104589:3"/>
Å¿oon made a <hi>ConqueÅ¿t</hi> over me and my

            </p>
            <p>I know the high Talkers, the lighter
and cenÅ¿orious part of People, wil Å¿hoot
many a <hi>bitter Arrow</hi> to wound my <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,</hi>
and charge me with <hi>Levity</hi>
and <hi>InconÅ¿tancy,</hi> becauÅ¿e I am not obÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
like themÅ¿elves, againÅ¿t ConÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Right ReaÅ¿on, NeceÅ¿sity, the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tome
of all Nations, and the Peace of
our own. But this Å¿ort of men I reckon
<hi>inter Bruta animantia;</hi> among whom to
do well is to hear ill; who uÅ¿ually Å¿peak
amiÅ¿Å¿e of thoÅ¿e things that they do not,
or will not underÅ¿tand. From them
therefore I appeale to the <hi>Great Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi>
where it is known I have in this
dealt faithfully; and to the more Å¿ober
Intelligences, here below, with whom
theÅ¿e Papers muÅ¿t needs find the more
<hi>free entertainment,</hi> becauÅ¿e free from
partiality, and the leaÅ¿t tincture of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:104589:3"/>
And that they may be the fitter to
walk abroad in the world, I have divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them into <hi>Two Parts,</hi> and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated
Them with a <hi>Method,</hi> Å¿uitable
to thoÅ¿e two Parties whereof the world
conÅ¿iÅ¿ts; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>ConÅ¿cientious</hi> man, and
the <hi>Worldling.</hi> The former wil approve
nothing but what is <hi>juÅ¿t</hi> and <hi>equitable;</hi>
and therefore I have labored to Å¿atisfie
him (as I have done my Self) touching
the <hi>JuÅ¿tice</hi> of SubmiÅ¿sion: The latter
will imbrace any thing, Å¿o it make for
his <hi>Profit;</hi> and therefore I have Å¿hewn
him the <hi>Inconveniences</hi> and <hi>Dangers,</hi>
that will follow his oppoÅ¿ition of a <hi>Å¿ettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
Now, though the other Å¿hould
continue <hi>obÅ¿tinate</hi> in their <hi>erroneous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences;</hi>
yet of this latter Å¿ort, I dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿e
my Self an abundance of <hi>ProÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes,</hi>
the greater part of the world being
led more by Appetites of <hi>Convenience</hi>
and <hi>Commodity,</hi> than the Dictates of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:104589:4"/>
And it is a more current way of
perÅ¿waÅ¿ion, by telling men what will be
<hi>profitable</hi> and <hi>convenient</hi> for them to do,
than what they <hi>ought</hi> to do.</p>
            <p>But Prethee read, and then do what
thou liÅ¿t: I have onely one word more;
&amp; that is to our <hi>modern PhariÅ¿ee,</hi> the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ciencious
Pretender,</hi> and principall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿turber
of the publique Peace. If hee
will not be convinced by Å¿o clear TeÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
but raiÅ¿e more duÅ¿t about our
ears, to amaze the People, it muÅ¿t be
concluded; That all this noiÅ¿e of <hi>Church-Reformation,
ConÅ¿cience,</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> is
a mere malicious DeÅ¿igne to drive on a
<hi>Faction,</hi> for the caÅ¿ting down of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent

ThemÅ¿elves in the Seat of Authority.â
<hi>Farewell,</hi> and be wiÅ¿e. Being convinced

At length the Sword divided the Empire into <hi>EaÅ¿t</hi> and <hi>WeÅ¿t,</hi>
and in the Å¿ame manner likewiÅ¿e each of them Å¿uffered many

onely diÅ¿poÅ¿er, and diÅ¿penÅ¿er of Titles to Common-weals and
Kingdomes. We find <hi>Jacob</hi> on his death-bed, bequeathing one
Portion to <hi>JoÅ¿eph,</hi> above the reÅ¿t of his brethren; and that was
a Parcell which he took out of the hand of the <hi>Amorite</hi> with

though it were allotted them by divine promiÅ¿e and
diÅ¿penÅ¿ation; yet (as to the eye of the world) they were to
lay claime and take poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion by the <hi>Power of the Sword,</hi> and
Å¿o accordingly they received commiÅ¿Å¿ion to ratifie their Title,
by a ConqueÅ¿t of the <hi>Canaanites;</hi> after which, <hi>Jure gentium,</hi> it
became for ever <hi>unquestionable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the HiÅ¿tory of the Kings of <hi>IÅ¿rael,</hi> we read, that moÅ¿t of

Right, to the prejudice of him that was his Soveraigne, and to

both before, and Å¿ince the <hi>Norman Conquest.</hi> FirÅ¿t, the Sword
of <hi>CaeÅ¿ar</hi> triumphed over the Liberties of the poor <hi>Britaines,</hi>

and gave the <hi>Romans</hi> here a Title to their Dominion. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
their Liberty returning again, when the <hi>Roman Empire</hi>
fell to pieces, a new <hi>Title</hi> was Å¿etled by the <hi>Sword</hi> of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors
the <hi>Saxons,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Chron.</note> who Å¿ubmitted for a Time, upon the Å¿ame

                     <hi>Swords,</hi> to recover their own Title againÅ¿t the <hi>DaniÅ¿h</hi> Tyranny.

                  </p>
                  <p>And upon examination it appears, he had no better Title to

<hi>Henry</hi> the fifth made good not onely that Title, but craved out

of the <hi>Salick</hi> ConÅ¿titution; and left it Å¿o confirmed unto his
Sonne <hi>Henry</hi> the Å¿ixth, that he was Crowned King of <hi>France</hi>
at <hi>Paris,</hi> and Å¿o continued, till (Fortune turning) his Title was
Cancell'd there by the Sword of the <hi>French,</hi> as it was likewiÅ¿e in
<hi>England</hi> by that of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth; whoÅ¿e Sonne <hi>Edward</hi>
the fifth left the Crown in the bloody hands of <hi>Richard</hi> the
third, from whence it was wreÅ¿ted by <hi>Henry</hi> the Å¿eventh. This
<hi>Henry</hi> (from whom the late King derived his Claime) came in
with an Army, and (as one hath well obÅ¿erved) <hi>by meer Power
was made King in the Army, and by the Army; Å¿o that in the very
Field where he got the Victory, the Crown was Å¿et upon his Head,
and there he gave Knighthood to many of his Commanders.</hi> Upon
<hi>this Foundation of Military Power, he got himÅ¿elf afterwards Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
Crowned at</hi> WeÅ¿tminÅ¿ter. <hi>And Å¿oon after, upon Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
thus gotten, he called a Parliament, and in that Parliament
was the Crown entailed upon him and his Heirs. Thus both his
Crown and his Parliament were founded upon Power: As for any
just Title, he could have none; for, he deÅ¿cended from a BaÅ¿tard of</hi>
John <hi>of</hi> Gaunt, <hi>which (though legitimated for common Inheritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
yet) expreÅ¿ly was excluded from SucceÅ¿Å¿ion to the Crown. And
for his Wives Title, that came in after his KingÅ¿hip, and his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
which had Å¿etled the Crown before upon him and his Heirs.
And he was Å¿o far from exerciÅ¿ing authority in her Right, that her
Name is not uÅ¿ed in any Laws, as Queen</hi> Mary's <hi>was, both before
and after her Marriage with the</hi> SpaniÅ¿h <hi>King.</hi>

                  <p>Now, having made it evident out of the HiÅ¿tories of all Times,

                  <p>One <hi>Objection</hi> more he hath; how that <hi>a Calling from the
People, being neceÅ¿Å¿ary and eÅ¿Å¿entiall, to a humanely conÅ¿tituted
MagiÅ¿tracy,</hi> our preÅ¿ent Governors ought to have Å¿uch a <hi>Call;</hi>
but not having it, they are therefore concluded guilty of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿urpation.</hi>
This is the Å¿umm of the <hi>Objection,</hi> though not Syllogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tically
deciphered. To which I anÅ¿wer: 1. That if only a Call
from the People conÅ¿titute a lawfull MagiÅ¿tracy, then there hath
very rarely ever been any lawfull MagiÅ¿tracy in the world,
nor among us long before and Å¿ince the <hi>ConqueÅ¿t.</hi> The proofe
of this may be confirmed by a Review of thoÅ¿e InÅ¿tances Å¿et
down before in the Å¿econd <hi>Chapter;</hi> where it is evident, that all
the world over, moÅ¿t <hi>Princes</hi> came into the Seat of Authority
not only without a <hi>Call,</hi> but abÅ¿olutely againÅ¿t the wills of the
People, and Å¿o, many of them exerciÅ¿e the Soveraignty to this
very day: And particularly, here in <hi>England,</hi> moÅ¿t of our own
Kings reigned without any <hi>Call,</hi> but made way by their Swords;
there being of thoÅ¿e 25 Princes that have King'd it among us,
not above half a dozen that came to the Crowne in an orderly
SucceÅ¿Å¿ion, either by lineall or collaterall Title: And not any
one of thoÅ¿e <hi>halfe dozen</hi> but laid claime to it, by vertue of
their PredeceÅ¿Å¿ors UÅ¿urpations, without any <hi>Call</hi> from the
People; onely in the InveÅ¿titure they had their conÅ¿ent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e
out of a love of publike Peace, none would, or out of
Feare, none durÅ¿t offer to queÅ¿tion their Titles. Now, if the
former part of this Objection were true, that a <hi>Call</hi> were the
only <hi>EÅ¿Å¿entiall,</hi> conÅ¿tituting a lawfull Government, then it
would follow, that as all the world, Å¿o we and our AnceÅ¿tors
have lived and paid obedience for the moÅ¿t part, under an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
MagiÅ¿tracie; which Å¿ure no Å¿ober man will affirm. But
if any will be Å¿o mad as to Å¿ay it, I only propound to him this
Å¿ober <hi>Quaere,</hi> Why we may not now as lawfully Å¿ubmit to the
preÅ¿ent MagiÅ¿tracy, in caÅ¿e it were unlawfull, as our AnceÅ¿tors
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104589:16"/>
did heretofore to theirs, for the publike Peace of the Nation?</p>
                  <p>2. As to the <hi>AÅ¿Å¿umptive</hi> part part of this <hi>Objection,</hi> which inÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates,
that our preÅ¿ent Governors have no <hi>Call</hi> or <hi>ConÅ¿ent</hi>
of the People, I anÅ¿wer, That if by the conÅ¿ent be meant
the ConÅ¿ent of the Body of the People, or of the major part of
their RepreÅ¿entatives, this may hold requiÅ¿ite in a State not
divided by <hi>Civill War,</hi> but at Peace within it Å¿elf; where it is
moÅ¿t conÅ¿onant to reaÅ¿on, that in caÅ¿e there be occaÅ¿ion to elect
a Å¿upreme MagiÅ¿trate, or MagiÅ¿trates, the election Å¿hould be
carried by the greater number of <hi>Voices,</hi> in Å¿uch manner as <hi>Voices</hi>
are uÅ¿ually given in that State; But now in a <hi>Civil War</hi> the caÅ¿e is
altered, when the controverÅ¿ie touching Government is decided
by the Sword: For, <hi>ipÅ¿o facto</hi> the <hi>Sword</hi> creates a Title for him,

one <hi>Objection</hi> very frequent in the mouthes of many: That this

is ingaged againÅ¿t Nation; but in one Å¿ingle Nation within its
Å¿elf it cannot; becauÅ¿e (Å¿ay they) it Å¿eems unreaÅ¿onable that a

                     </label> To this I anÅ¿wer,that warlick AcquiÅ¿itions hold as good in
civill DiviÅ¿ions within the Å¿ame Nation, as in war betwixt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Nation: For, where a Nation is ingaged in a <hi>Civill
war,</hi> and divided into parties, the eye of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nations</hi>
looks not on them as one Nation,<note place="margin">In Tract at. de <hi>Legatis.</hi>
                     </note> but as two, according to
that of <hi>Grotius: In Regno diviÅ¿o, gens una, pro tempore, quaÅ¿i duae
gentes habentur:</hi> In a divided State, one Nation, during the
time of its Nationall DiviÅ¿ions, is eÅ¿teemed as two Nations; Å¿o
that what preeminence Nation may gaine over Nation by right
of <hi>forein war,</hi> the Å¿ame may be obtained likewiÅ¿e by one part of
a Nation againÅ¿t the other, by Right of <hi>civill war:</hi> And what

                     <hi>Thus by all the PremiÅ¿es it is undeniably evident, in a way of

Right and juÅ¿t Title to be our Governours; and that this new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
erected by them, to the Å¿ubverÅ¿ion of the old, is as valid

both thoÅ¿e Oaths are <hi>Religious Acts,</hi> as they are Å¿olemnized

are qualified from their principall End; Å¿o the maine end of
thoÅ¿e Oaths being Obedience to the Prince in order to the good

                  <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Concerning the Royall Party.</head>
                  <p>THE <hi>RoyalliÅ¿ts</hi> are of two Sorts. <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> Å¿uch as adhere to the
<hi>Prince</hi> out of <hi>neceÅ¿Å¿ity; Secondly,</hi> Å¿uch as adhere to him out
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:104589:22"/>
of <hi>humor.</hi> The former are ThoÅ¿e, who being hopeleÅ¿Å¿e of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
or of the recovery of their Fortunes, by way of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement,
are conÅ¿trained to run any hazard abroad with the
head of their Party, and turne every Å¿tone to over-turn the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent
Powers here in <hi>England,</hi> that they may Å¿et up ThemÅ¿elves.
The latter Sort of <hi>RoyalliÅ¿ts,</hi> are Å¿uch, as though they Å¿erved
heretofore under the <hi>Royall Standard,</hi> yet, through the Favour
of the Parliament, have re-gained poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of their EÅ¿tates:
And therefore being re-inveÅ¿ted with their Fortunes, They are
loth as yet to attend the <hi>Prince</hi> in perÅ¿on, though they follow
him with their wiÅ¿hes, and would be glad to imbrace any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igne
underhand, or perhaps (when time Å¿erves) appear here
again in the Field, to make way for his Advancement. TheÅ¿e
may (not improperly) be called <hi>humorous RoyalliÅ¿ts,</hi> becauÅ¿e
they have only an obÅ¿tinate and <hi>vain-glorious humor</hi> for the
ground of their behaviour, without any reÅ¿pect of Advantage
to ThemÅ¿elves, but are ridden by the other to carry on the <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Royall</hi>
deÅ¿igne of Particular perÅ¿ons, and run a new hazard of
their own. To reÅ¿tore the Å¿ingle Family of a <hi>Prince,</hi> Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿ed by
the <hi>Almighty,</hi> they Å¿eeme willing to Venture the deÅ¿truction of
all their own Families; and to Å¿erve the ends of certain PerÅ¿ons
about him, men whoÅ¿e Fortunes are deÅ¿perate, they are apt to
foole themÅ¿elves into the loÅ¿Å¿e of their owne; as they muÅ¿t needs
doe, if the <hi>Prince</hi> miÅ¿-carry in his Enterprize, whereas if he
Å¿hould carry it with SucceÅ¿Å¿e, They will be then but where they
were, They can be but <hi>MaÅ¿ters</hi> of what they have already. The
<hi>high Ranters</hi> and Fugitives are they that will be look't on at
<hi>Court;</hi> ThoÅ¿e <hi>Bell-weathers</hi> of <hi>Royalty</hi> will <hi>bear away the Bell
of Preferment,</hi> whilÅ¿t the poore <hi>Countrey-RoyalliÅ¿ts</hi> (both <hi>Gentry</hi>
and <hi>Yeomen)</hi> Å¿hall be glad to drudge and plow, to pay thoÅ¿e
yet unknown <hi>Taxations,</hi> which muÅ¿t needs be collected, to Å¿atiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the <hi>forlorn Brethren</hi> of the <hi>Sword,</hi> the many <hi>yonger Brothers,</hi>
and <hi>Strangers,</hi> which will come in with the <hi>Grandees,</hi> in hope to
purchaÅ¿e a Fortune by Å¿queezing the Publique.</p>
                  <p>All which being conÅ¿idered, it is awonder to Å¿ee, how They
feed ThemÅ¿elves with Phant'Å¿ies, who pretend in this Nation to
the reÅ¿titution of <hi>Royality;</hi> how their eyes are dazled with that
<hi>Sun</hi> which Å¿eems to riÅ¿e upon their Party, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing the <hi>golden

                     </hi> muÅ¿t needs return again with him, and that he will climb
up to the <hi>Meridian,</hi> in Å¿pight of all oppoÅ¿ition! But to give
them a Cooler for theÅ¿e Conceits, I Å¿hall more particularly,
according to the Method before propounded, Å¿hew firÅ¿t the
Improbability of SucceÅ¿Å¿e in the new <hi>Royall DeÅ¿ignes;</hi> and then,
the grand Inconveniences that would follow Å¿uch a SucceÅ¿Å¿e,
that all miÅ¿taken PerÅ¿ons may Å¿ee, how far they wander (to the
hazard of themÅ¿elves) out of that way, which leads to the future
happineÅ¿Å¿e of this Nation.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Improbability</hi> of the <hi>Prince</hi>'s SucceÅ¿Å¿e in his DeÅ¿igne,
FirÅ¿t, he is like to have but a Å¿lender Supply of <hi>forein Aids:</hi> For,
the Affairs of <hi>ChriÅ¿tendom</hi> are at this time Å¿o diÅ¿poÅ¿ed, that
Å¿ome Princes want leiÅ¿ure; others ability to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t Him: And
divers there are which refrain, for particular <hi>ReaÅ¿ons of State.</hi>
The <hi>Spaniard</hi> hath other <hi>FiÅ¿h to frie,</hi> keeping a Å¿erious eie upon
<hi>France,</hi> and lying at Catch againÅ¿t <hi>Portugal.</hi> BeÅ¿ides, there are
Å¿everall ReaÅ¿ons (not fit here to mention) which may diÅ¿poÅ¿e
him rather to imbrace the Amity of this <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> as it is
now eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed; and whereof there is Å¿ome hope (were there
no other ground) in that he hath given our <hi>Agent</hi> a friendly
reception.</p>
                  <p>So likewiÅ¿e hath the King of <hi>Portugall</hi> too another <hi>Agent;</hi>
and how far he is from neglecting our FriendÅ¿hip, may appear
by his Demeanour toward our Fleet, in the Port of <hi>Lisbon,</hi>
where he hath given them the like Freedom and entertainment
as he doth to <hi>Rupert,</hi> carrying himÅ¿elfe indifferently between
both, though he Å¿eem a little to incline Å¿omewhat more toward
<hi>Rupert;</hi> not out of any good will, but only in regard of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engagement
to that Party.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> hath his hands full enough at home, Å¿o
that he hath little liÅ¿t or leiÅ¿ure to mind Affairs abroad; being
jealous not only of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but even of his owne Subjects,
by reaÅ¿on of their regret at the inÅ¿upporrtable Taxes, the DiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents
and Bandyings of his Parliaments in the Å¿everall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
and the PartiÅ¿ans of the <hi>ImpriÅ¿oned Princes;</hi> all which
Å¿eem to threaten (if not the <hi>Monarchy</hi> it Self, yet) the Family
of the <hi>Monarch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Denmark</hi> hath hitherto given but a coole Acknowledgment
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:104589:23"/>
of Å¿o neare an alliance, having been (at the beÅ¿t) but a Retiring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place
for <hi>MontroÅ¿e,</hi> Å¿econding this with Å¿ome other Å¿light Å¿uper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
courteÅ¿ies; one of the beÅ¿t of which was (to rid their hands
of their GueÅ¿t) by lending him a few <hi>Bottoms,</hi> firÅ¿t, to Å¿eek his
better Fortune in <hi>Swethland,</hi> and then to waft him and his <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn
hope</hi> toward their long homes, into <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some Å¿uch triviall Supplies likewiÅ¿e may be expected from
the <hi>Swede,</hi> with a few Complements from the <hi>Emperour</hi> and
<hi>German</hi> Princes, their jealouÅ¿ies of each other not permitting
them to Å¿pare their Forces: For, whoÅ¿oever conÅ¿iders the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes
and Shifts made by the <hi>Emperour</hi> and his party, in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the Articles of Peace; and on the other Å¿ide, the reÅ¿olution
of the <hi>Swede</hi> and that Party to have them fully performed (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with thoÅ¿e heart-burnings among them, which break out
often into Flames in every Corner) may eaÅ¿ily imagine the peace
of <hi>Germany</hi> is not long-liv'd, and therefore that neither of thoÅ¿e
<hi>Princes</hi> will part with many of their Soldiery.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> eÅ¿teem it a Å¿afe way to conform themÅ¿elves
ever to the Prevailing Party in <hi>England,</hi> having ReaÅ¿on, above
all others, to prize the FriendÅ¿hip and Amity of the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi>
Nation. And though Å¿ome common CourteÅ¿ies are expreÅ¿Å¿ed
there to the <hi>Prince</hi> by way of entertainment; yet theÅ¿e are
done rather to comply with the deÅ¿ires of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
than out of any inclination or affection to the <hi>Royall Party;</hi>
whereas the Sence of the <hi>States Provinciall</hi> (and in them the
meaning of the whole People) is, to preÅ¿erve a Å¿trict CorreÅ¿pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with the Common-wealth of <hi>England.</hi> Nor do they reliÅ¿h
thoÅ¿e cloÅ¿e Combinations between the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and his
<hi>Brother;</hi> fearing Å¿o great an Alliance may diÅ¿poÅ¿e <hi>Orange</hi> to
aÅ¿pire, and eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h a greater <hi>IntereÅ¿t</hi> of his own than is meet
for a Member of a Republique, if <hi>Monarchy</hi> come to its height
again in <hi>England;</hi> which they ought by no means to deÅ¿ire, but
rather that <hi>England</hi> Å¿hould continue as it is; not onely for the
former ReaÅ¿on, but alÅ¿o, for that Å¿uch a <hi>Neighbourhood</hi> would be
concerned in ReaÅ¿on, to admit Them into a nearer FriendÅ¿hip
and Complication of <hi>IntereÅ¿ts,</hi> than ever they can hope from a
<hi>Monarchy.</hi>â</p>
                  <p>TheÅ¿e things being conÅ¿idered, the <hi>Prince</hi> hath Å¿mall hope of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104589:23"/>
SucceÅ¿Å¿e, in regard of any conÅ¿iderable Supplies from <hi>Forein
Princes.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Put caÅ¿e he can, by the help of the many <hi>fugitive
EngliÅ¿h,</hi> the <hi>Scots,</hi> and Supplies drain'd out of the Dregs of
Å¿everall Countries, make Å¿hift to patch up an Army, or two, to
trie his Fortune, yet 'tis ten to one but They ruine his DeÅ¿igne.
For, firÅ¿t, the introducing of <hi>Forrainers</hi> will Å¿oone alienate the
Affections of the <hi>EngliÅ¿h,</hi> as experience hath proved in all times.
<hi>Secondly, Auxiliatores conducti ex diverÅ¿is locis, nec diÅ¿ciplinÃ¢ inter
Å¿e, nec affectione conÅ¿entiunt.</hi>

                  <p>To paÅ¿Å¿e by the TeÅ¿timonies of many other <hi>States men,</hi> we have

Princes with Chaines, and their Nobles with links of Iron,</hi> Å¿ince
every month brings in freÅ¿h <hi>Laurels</hi> of Victory, to their Terror
and amazement. But <hi>Ireland</hi> being given for loÅ¿t, let us Å¿ee next,
whether the <hi>RoyalliÅ¿ts</hi> are like to receive any more comfort
from <hi>Scotland:</hi> Its an old Å¿aying, <hi>Nullum bonum ex Aquilone,</hi>
No good comes out of the North; and of all others, <hi>RoyalliÅ¿ts</hi>
Å¿hould be the leaÅ¿t apt to beleeve any benefit to come out of that
<hi>Nation,</hi> from whence proceeded the Ruine and DeÅ¿truction of
the late <hi>King,</hi> and all their Party; nor can they hope much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of them in time to come. For, <hi>firÅ¿t,</hi> They adhere to the
<hi>Prince,</hi> not out of any love to his <hi>IntereÅ¿t,</hi> but onely in hope to
Å¿ettle their own upon his Shoulders; and therefore if they can
make a better Bargain elÅ¿ewhere, they wil caÅ¿t him off, or (if he be
in their power) Å¿ell him off (as they did his <hi>Father)</hi> upon the
firÅ¿t occaÅ¿ion. What elÅ¿e can he expect from a Party, whoÅ¿e <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereÅ¿t</hi>
was firÅ¿t founded upon the ruine of his <hi>Great Grand-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
continued and augmented to the perpetuall vexation of his
<hi>Grand father,</hi> and at length proÅ¿ecuted to the deÅ¿truction of his
<hi>Father? Secondly,</hi> it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible to reconcile the two Parties,
<hi>Royall</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> even as impoÅ¿Å¿ible <hi>(King James</hi> was
wont to Å¿ay) as to reconcile <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Devill. Thirdly,</hi> if
They cannot be reconciled or Å¿tand together, then whatÅ¿oever
Agreemens may be made, it will be but from the Teeth
outward; nor can there be an union betwixt them upon any
deÅ¿igne, but in the proÅ¿ecution thereof they will mind the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of their Å¿everall IntereÅ¿ts, which muÅ¿t make them
jealous of each other, divided and partiall in their CounÅ¿els, and
cauÅ¿e the inward rancor to break out, to the prejudice and
utter ruine of the whole Engagement. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> let the <hi>Scots</hi>
invade us again upon the <hi>Royall,</hi> or what Å¿core elÅ¿e they pleaÅ¿e,
They will never be endured (eÅ¿pecially in the <hi>Northern</hi> Parts)
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:104589:24"/>
having heretofore by their perfidious and Tyrannical behaviour,
fixed an odious ImpreÅ¿Å¿ion upon the Spirits of the People, and
quickned the old Antipathy betwixt the two Nations: So that,
if the <hi>Prince</hi> come in with them, or by them, he will fare never
the better (but much worÅ¿e) for their Sakes, or their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
<hi>LaÅ¿tly,</hi> they come (if they dare come) a moÅ¿t naÅ¿ty,
lowzie, beaten Generation, againÅ¿t one of the moÅ¿t generous,
beÅ¿t accompliÅ¿hed, and moÅ¿t Victorious Armies in <hi>ChriÅ¿tendome;</hi>
an Army that muÅ¿t needs be diÅ¿honoured by Å¿uch an Enemy,
from whom neither Credit nor Advantage is to be gotten; yet
it is meet they Å¿hould be chaÅ¿tized, Å¿ince the <hi>Almighty,</hi> out of
love to the future Peace of our Nation, Å¿eemes to decree, that
<hi>Belial</hi> and <hi>Dagon, MontroÅ¿e,</hi> and the <hi>Kirk,</hi> with her <hi>Worthies</hi>
Å¿hould be Å¿ent after <hi>Hamilton.</hi> This indeed, would be a fair Å¿tep
to <hi>Reformation,</hi> by letting out the Corruption of that Country,
which Å¿ticks like a <hi>Scab,</hi> upon the faire Body of this <hi>Fortunate
IÅ¿land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, in the laÅ¿t place, to conclude this particular touching the
Improbability of the <hi>Prince</hi>'s SucceÅ¿Å¿e, Å¿ince he hath little ground
to hope for any by the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of other <hi>Nations,</hi> let us examine
what hope he hath from our own. Severall ReaÅ¿ons may be
given to the contrary; As firÅ¿t, the People's hatred of <hi>Foreiners,</hi>
and their feare of that Plague, univerÅ¿all <hi>Free-quarter,</hi> with their

                     </note> upon this Ground,
becauÅ¿e <hi>they conceived it dangerous for them, and the whole State, to

that he is noted in our <hi>Chronicles,</hi> to be the firÅ¿t of all our Kings,

of Butchering the Bodies of the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> by <hi>Behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

in a <hi>Tyranny.</hi>
                  </p>

hope they Å¿hall be eaÅ¿ed of <hi>ExciÅ¿e</hi> and <hi>Taxes, &amp;c.</hi> if he be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tored,
they are exceedingly miÅ¿taken. I remember a PaÅ¿Å¿age out
of the Stories of <hi>France;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Du Serres.</note> that the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> having, upon
a difference betwixt him and the King, laid a Tax upon Å¿ome of
the Provinces, by their owne conÅ¿ent, to maintein his Army;
afterward, allured with fair promiÅ¿es, they inclined the <hi>Duke</hi> to
accord with the <hi>King,</hi> hoping to be eaÅ¿ed of the ImpoÅ¿ition;
but they fell Å¿hort of their deÅ¿ires; for, that which they had vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
impoÅ¿ed upon ThemÅ¿elves, was Å¿etled upon Them <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force</hi>
by the King, when he once had them in poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion: And Å¿o
that Tax, which was called the <hi>Gabel,</hi> continues upon them to
this very day, as a Token of their folly. Now, let not us flatter
our Å¿elves here in <hi>England,</hi> that we Å¿hall fare any better (in point
of <hi>ExciÅ¿e,</hi> or other payments) upon the <hi>Prince</hi>'s reÅ¿titution.
If now we have <hi>Burthens,</hi> we muÅ¿t then look to have <hi>Furrows,</hi>
made upon our backs: If now we are (through neceÅ¿Å¿ity) put
to endure a few <hi>whips,</hi> we Å¿hall then (of Å¿et purpoÅ¿e) be chaÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed
with <hi>Scorpions.</hi> It is not an <hi>ExciÅ¿e,</hi> or an <hi>Army</hi> that we
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104589:28"/>
Å¿hall Å¿cape, but be viÅ¿ited with whole Legions of <hi>forein DeÅ¿pera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does,</hi>
which muÅ¿t be fed with greater Payments than ever, and
(God knowes) when we Å¿hall be rid of them, if the Prince Å¿ettle
upon their Å¿houlders. ConÅ¿ider, how many hungry <hi>Scots</hi> gape
after this <hi>gude Land,</hi> who, with thoÅ¿e of other <hi>Nations,</hi> muÅ¿t be
Satisfied out of the PurÅ¿es of our own, whilÅ¿t thoÅ¿e that are their
<hi>Leaders</hi> will be gratified, with this, that, and the other Mans
Lands and poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ions. And that this InÅ¿inuation is no Fiction,
but well grounded upon Precedents out of our owne HiÅ¿tories,
in the Practices of our Kings, may appear by the Proceedings of
the <hi>Conquerer;</hi> who being forced to extraordinary CourÅ¿es to
Å¿atisfie his forein Soldiery, made bold Å¿o frequently with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tates
of his Subjects, that the great Lords of the Kingdom, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it would come to their Turns at laÅ¿t to part with their PoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eÅ¿ions,
by way of prevention, Å¿led out of the Land, Å¿ome into
<hi>Scotland,</hi> Å¿ome into <hi>Denmarke,</hi> and other Parts, <hi>to trie if by aide
from abroad, they might recover ThemÅ¿elves and their Fortunes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
at home:</hi> But by this means they hapned to loÅ¿e all Å¿o
much the Å¿ooner; for, miÅ¿carrying in the DeÅ¿igne, their EÅ¿tates
were poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s'd, and their Offices Å¿upplied by the <hi>Norman</hi> Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites.
Thus alÅ¿o, King <hi>Stephen,</hi> himÅ¿elf being a <hi>Foreiner.</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
moÅ¿t upon forein Arms to preÅ¿erve him in poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion, was
conÅ¿trained to take the Å¿ame CourÅ¿e, for the Å¿atisfaction of his
<hi>forein Auxiliaries,</hi> which conÅ¿iÅ¿ted moÅ¿t of <hi>Flemings</hi> and <hi>Picards,</hi>
whom he eÅ¿pecially truÅ¿ted in his greateÅ¿t Actions, neglecting and
oppreÅ¿Å¿ing the <hi>EngliÅ¿h.</hi> Thus did <hi>Henry</hi> the third alÅ¿o in his wars
with the <hi>Barons;</hi> againÅ¿t whom bringing in Foreiners, He, for
reward, inveÅ¿ted them with others Lands and Honors, and laid
heavy ImpoÅ¿itions beÅ¿ides upon the whole Kingdom, to make
Them Satisfaction. And in thoÅ¿e variations of Fortune between
the two HouÅ¿es of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>LancaÅ¿ter,</hi> as often as either of
Them had occaÅ¿ion to make uÅ¿e of forein Arms to aÅ¿Å¿ert their
Titles, the EÅ¿tates of the AdverÅ¿e Party, and the PurÅ¿es of the
People, were Å¿ure to goe to wrack for the Pay of the Soldiery.
From hence then it appears, that if the Prince put himÅ¿elfe in
poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion by Arms, we Å¿hall be Å¿o far that way from any eaÅ¿e of
our burthens, that they will be doubled, and trebled, yea, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded
upon us.</p>

                     <hi>LaÅ¿tly,</hi> The Prince's Confederation with the <hi>Scots,</hi> and our
<hi>EngliÅ¿h Presbyters,</hi> (were there no other ReaÅ¿on) might be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to terrifie any ingeniouÅ¿ly minded People from giving
their aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance, be they <hi>RoyaliÅ¿ts,</hi> or not: For, if the Kirke be able
to bind the <hi>Prince</hi> to hard Conditions, and prove (like the Sons
of <hi>Zeruiah)</hi> too Å¿trong for him, Å¿o that his <hi>IntereÅ¿t</hi> bow to theirs,
then in Å¿tead of a <hi>Regall</hi> (which is more tolerable) we muÅ¿t all
Å¿toop to the intolerable yoke of a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Tyranny, that will
prove a plague upon the ConÅ¿ciences, Bodies, and PurÅ¿es of this
free Nation. The <hi>Scots</hi> by this means will effect their DeÅ¿igne
upon us, by Å¿tretching their <hi>Covenant-union</hi> to an equality of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereÅ¿t</hi>
with us in our owne Affairs: And the <hi>EngliÅ¿h-Grandees</hi> of
that Party will Å¿eat themÅ¿elves again in the <hi>HouÅ¿e,</hi> and exclude
all others, or elÅ¿e a New Parliament Å¿hall be called of PerÅ¿ons of
their owne <hi>Faction;</hi> Å¿o that if they Å¿hould carry the day, all the
Comfort we Å¿hall have by caÅ¿ting off the preÅ¿ent Governers, will
be only that we Å¿hall have theÅ¿e furious <hi>Jockies</hi> for our Riders:
Things (perhaps) Å¿hall be in the old <hi>Statu quo,</hi> as they were
when the late King was at <hi>Holdenby,</hi> whoÅ¿e Son muÅ¿t then lay his
Scepter at the Foot-Å¿tole of the <hi>Kirke,</hi> or elÅ¿e they will reÅ¿tore
him by leiÅ¿ure (as they did his Father) into the <hi>exerciÅ¿e</hi> of Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty:
By which means we Å¿hould be brought again, as far as ever
we were, from a condition of Settlement, and the Common-wealth
reduced to AÅ¿hes by endleÅ¿Å¿e CumbuÅ¿tions. On the other
Side, put caÅ¿e the <hi>Prince</hi> have the <hi>better end of the Staffe</hi> of the
<hi>Presbyters,</hi> (they relying upon his CourteÅ¿ie, as well as the reÅ¿t of
the People) then, in caÅ¿e he carry the day, They, and All, are at
his mercy, and no Bar will be in the way to hinder him from an
AÅ¿cent unto an <hi>unlimited Power:</hi> So that you plainly Å¿ee, this
preÅ¿ent Combination of <hi>RoyalliÅ¿ts</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> (which Å¿oever
of them be moÅ¿t prevalent) muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity put the Nation in
hazard between <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charybdis,</hi> that we cannot chuÅ¿e but
fall into one of the pernicious Gulphs, either of <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> or
<hi>Monarchicall</hi> Tyranny.</p>
                  <p>All theÅ¿e Particulars being Å¿eriouÅ¿ly conÅ¿idered; how Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
it is in the firÅ¿t place that the <hi>Prince</hi> Å¿hould goe on with
SucceÅ¿Å¿e in his <hi>DeÅ¿igne;</hi> and then, what <hi>miÅ¿erable Inconveniences</hi>
muÅ¿t needs follow Å¿uch a SucceÅ¿Å¿e (in caÅ¿e he prevaile) not only
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:104589:29"/>
to the Prejudice of any one Party, but of All, I may undeniably
conclude, that all miÅ¿taken <hi>RoyalliÅ¿ts,</hi> as well as others, who live
now under the Protection of the <hi>preÅ¿ent Government,</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
out of neceÅ¿Å¿ity, and in reÅ¿pect to their owne well-being
and benefit, to wiÅ¿h well thereunto, rather than proÅ¿ecute the

They make ThemÅ¿elves ConÅ¿iderable by being troubleÅ¿ome,
it will not be amiÅ¿Å¿e to Å¿ound the Depth of their preÅ¿ent DeÅ¿ign;
which that I may the better doe, give me leave to trace them in
their <hi>Encroachments,</hi> from the firÅ¿t to the laÅ¿t, upon the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi>
Nation. Not to mention thoÅ¿e of elder date, let us begin with
King <hi>James</hi> who being a native <hi>Scot,</hi> out of love to his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
(or rather to himÅ¿elfe, that he might keep them quiet, by
Å¿topping their mouths with the Å¿weet morÅ¿els of <hi>England)</hi> was
pleaÅ¿ed to admit many of them into his Court, then into his
Councell, and to be partakers of Honours and Offices, equall to
the beÅ¿t of our <hi>EngliÅ¿h.</hi> His Son, the <hi>late King.</hi> knowing danger
might come of diÅ¿content out of the <hi>Northern</hi> Corner, followed
the Å¿ame CourÅ¿e that his <hi>Father</hi> tooke, to oblige Them; holding
them in <hi>PenÅ¿ion,</hi> giving acceÅ¿Å¿e to all <hi>Beggars,</hi> with Å¿uch faire
Entertainment, that moÅ¿t of Them Å¿taid here, and none returned
empty. This heaping of Favors upon Some, Å¿tirred up the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
and Emulation of others; who Å¿eeing themÅ¿elves neglected,
and not like to Å¿hare in any of theÅ¿e Enjoyments by the Favor of
the King, bethought them of an other way, to make ThemÅ¿elves
as conÅ¿iderable as the reÅ¿t of their <hi>Country-men,</hi> and gain an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereÅ¿t
with the <hi>EngliÅ¿h.</hi> Seeing they could not thrive with the
<hi>Court,</hi> They would trie what They could doe without it.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon, being men of Power in their owne Country, They
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:104589:29"/>
became moÅ¿t Zealous AÅ¿Å¿ertors of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> DiÅ¿cipline
againÅ¿t the <hi>EpiÅ¿copall,</hi> by which means they gained the FriendÅ¿hip
of all the <hi>Religious Party</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> then perÅ¿ecuted by the
<hi>BiÅ¿hops,</hi> who were at <hi>Court</hi> the only <hi>Favourites:</hi> Hereupon, theÅ¿e
<hi>Leaders</hi> of the <hi>ScotiÅ¿h Presbyterians,</hi> beginning to grow active
and forward in eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hing their own <hi>Form</hi> at home, and alÅ¿o to
propagate it abroad by encouraging their Friends, gave Å¿uch an
Alarm to the <hi>BiÅ¿hops,</hi> that they (to croÅ¿Å¿e the DeÅ¿igne) fell
foule upon all of <hi>the Opinion</hi> here in <hi>England;</hi> and not onely Å¿o,
but preÅ¿Å¿ed the <hi>King</hi> to eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h an <hi>EpiÅ¿copall <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>niformity</hi> in both
Kingdoms, even in <hi>Scotland</hi> as well as <hi>England.</hi> The forcing of
this upon the <hi>Scots</hi> was a CauÅ¿e of the Commotions in that
Kingdom; whereupon a war enÅ¿ued betwixt the King and Them
through the inÅ¿tigation of the <hi>BiÅ¿hops;</hi> which was Å¿oon ended, to
the Advantage of the <hi>Scots</hi> in Money and Credit, and to the diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor
of the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>EpiÅ¿copall Party.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This happy SucceÅ¿Å¿e wrought a very reverend opinion of them,
in the hearts of the <hi>well-affected Party</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> who Å¿tood for
the <hi>purity of Religion,</hi> and <hi>a liberty of ConÅ¿cience,</hi> againÅ¿t <hi>EpiÅ¿copall
power</hi> and <hi>Innovations;</hi> as alÅ¿o for the <hi>Lawes and Liberties of the
Nation,</hi> invaded by the <hi>Prerogative.</hi> And for redreÅ¿Å¿e of theÅ¿e
things the King was neceÅ¿Å¿itated to call a <hi>Parliament;</hi> who not
obtaining Å¿uch Reliefe of Grievances as they expected by reaÅ¿on
of a <hi>Corrupt Councell</hi> of <hi>BiÅ¿hops</hi> and others about the <hi>King,</hi> which
alienated him from his great Councell the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
cauÅ¿ed Him to breake out into a warre againÅ¿t Them, were
conÅ¿trained likewiÅ¿e to take Armes, in defence of our <hi>Liberties.</hi>
Hereupon, recourÅ¿e was had to the <hi>Scots</hi> for their aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance; who,
having the Å¿ame Enemies at <hi>Court,</hi> and being equally involved in
the Å¿ame common Danger, it was Å¿uppoÅ¿ed they were concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in ReaÅ¿on to joyn with the Parliament, without any DiÅ¿pute
or Scruple. But They, conÅ¿idering now was the Time to make
their Markets (if ever) and their owne intereÅ¿t as much <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi>
as might be, came not off Å¿o roundly as was hoped, but fell to
bartering like <hi>Hucksters,</hi> and no Bargaine would be (forÅ¿ooth)
without a <hi>Covenant.</hi> They would not joyn, except They might
be (in a manner) all one with us, and this <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>nion</hi> muÅ¿t be Å¿ealed
with that <hi>Å¿olemn League and Covenant.</hi> What their meaning was
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:104589:30"/>
therein, we Å¿hall know by and by, by taking a view of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ever Å¿ince, which are the moÅ¿t Å¿ure Interpreters: Yet even
at that time,<note place="margin">See the <hi>grand CaÅ¿e of ConÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,</hi> Å¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>Å¿ome men had their eyes in their heads, and many Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
were made at divers ExpreÅ¿Å¿ions in the</hi> Covenant, <hi>and many
DeÅ¿ires for explanation of Å¿ome Articles more fully.</hi> But the <hi>Scots</hi>
Å¿tanding Å¿tiffe upon their owne Terms, and no Conjunction like
to be obtained without the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of the
Parliaments Affairs admitting no delay, we were glad to take it
as it was offered, without further queÅ¿tion or Demurrer.</p>
                  <p>It was no Å¿ooner taken here at <hi>London,</hi> but immediately every
one began to make his Advantage (through the multitude and
ambiguity of ExpreÅ¿Å¿ions) and by it to promote his Å¿everall <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereÅ¿t;</hi>
as if it had been made to engage unto a particular Party,
not to unite two Nations in a common IntereÅ¿t. But above all
the <hi>Scots,</hi> having had the honor of this Invention, conceived
themÅ¿elves much injured by any, that denyed them the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of making an Interpretation; and in matter of Religion,
urged their owne DiÅ¿cipline as the only Patern to Reform the
Church by; and their Plea had been fair enough out of the
Covenant, could they have proved it to be <hi>[according to the
word of God;]</hi> which ClauÅ¿e was moÅ¿t luckily inÅ¿erted. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding
all the ReaÅ¿ons to the Contrary, the <hi>ScotiÅ¿h</hi> Module
was Å¿till preÅ¿Å¿ed: The <hi>Scot</hi> was willing to ride, and having (as he
thought) the <hi>EngliÅ¿h-man</hi> faÅ¿t bridled with a <hi>Covenant,</hi> he began
to Å¿witch and Å¿pur. The <hi>Throne of the Kirke</hi> was the <hi>Stalking-horÅ¿e</hi>
to catch <hi>geeÅ¿e;</hi> and if that could have been Å¿etled, then there
had been no denying Them whatÅ¿oever they would ask; They
would have Å¿eated themÅ¿elves Å¿urely in this fat Soile; There
would have been no removing them out of our Councels, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of our Affaires had made them Members and
Partakers. For, had the <hi>Kirk-IntereÅ¿t</hi> been once confirmed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us, then by vertue of that Authority which they uÅ¿e to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll
the <hi>Civill</hi> power, the Parliament muÅ¿t have been Å¿ubÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient
to all their ends. And Å¿ince it would have concerned the
<hi>EngliÅ¿h Clergy</hi> (to make their Party Å¿trong, and maintein Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿pondencies
for their owne preÅ¿ervation) to have gratified
their <hi>ScotiÅ¿h Founders</hi> in all their DeÅ¿ires, the <hi>Scots</hi> might eaÅ¿ily
have tranÅ¿lated the <hi>Covenant-union</hi> to as good as an abÅ¿olute
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104589:30"/>
                     <hi>Nationall union,</hi> by gaining a <hi>Joynt-IntereÅ¿t</hi> with us in our Affairs
for ever, and conÅ¿equently, in all the Profits, great Offices, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
and Concernments of this Nation.</p>
                  <p>Now, whether this were their DeÅ¿igne or not in the Covenant
<hi>ab origine,</hi> I Å¿hall not determine; but let it be judged by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olent
behaviour here among us, after they were admitted to our
CounÅ¿ells: and therefore in the next place I Å¿hall examine their
Proceedings, which moÅ¿t evidently repreÅ¿ent them in their Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
âIt Å¿ufficed them not; after they were come in, that
they had an equall Power with us in publique Affairs, in the
Committee of both Kingdoms at <hi>Derby</hi>-houÅ¿e (which was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
allowed them for a time, Å¿o far as concerned the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
cauÅ¿e of both Nations, in proÅ¿ecuting the war) but driving
a Powerfull Party in both <hi>HouÅ¿es,</hi> They tooke upon them to
meddle with matters relating to the future Peace and Settlement
of this Nation, diÅ¿tinct from their owne, and to provide for an

the <hi>

Peace being preÅ¿ented to the King, it was found the <hi>Scots</hi> had Å¿o
far Provided for ThemÅ¿elves by their Party in the <hi>HouÅ¿es,</hi> That
in time to come, the ordering of the <hi>EngliÅ¿h Militia,</hi> the Power
of making War and Peace, and all other Prerogatives of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
were to be adminiÅ¿tred by a proportionable number of
<hi>Scots,</hi> as well as <hi>EngliÅ¿h:</hi> A thing Å¿o ridiculous, and an Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Å¿o palpable, that the King HimÅ¿elf, in one of His AnÅ¿wers,
took notice of it, and Å¿aid, He <hi>was not Å¿o much an Enemy to the
EngliÅ¿h Nation, as to Å¿igne thoÅ¿e PropoÅ¿itions;</hi> or Å¿omewhat (I am
Å¿ure) to this PurpoÅ¿e.</p>
                  <p>A Å¿econd evidence or diÅ¿covery of their Encroachments was
made, upon their delivering in divers Papers to the Parliament,
at Å¿everall times, wherein they diÅ¿puted their Claim, and ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their <hi>Logick</hi> upon the Letter of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> to prove an
<hi>IntereÅ¿t</hi> in diÅ¿poÅ¿all of matters meerly relating to our welfare;
which they re-inforced afterwards with new Recruits of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when the King came into their Army.</p>
                  <p>But not knowing well how to maintaine their Arguments,
They were contented for that time, to quit Them and their
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:104589:31"/>
King too, upon Å¿uch Terms, as are notorious to all the world;
who being at length reduced under the Power of the Parliament
and Army, PropoÅ¿itions of Peace were Å¿ent to him at <hi>Hampton</hi>-Court,
wherein no Å¿uch ProviÅ¿ion being made for the <hi>ScotiÅ¿h</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereÅ¿t,
as was in thoÅ¿e at <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>xbridge,</hi> their CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners here
proteÅ¿ted againÅ¿t them<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> accuÅ¿ed the Parliament of Breach of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and complained highly in one of their <hi>Declarations</hi> that
they Å¿hould be Å¿o neglected. This may Å¿erve as a <hi>third evidence</hi>
of their <hi>Covenant-deÅ¿igne</hi> of Encroachment; whereto may be
added one more, when the King was at <hi>Carisbrooke</hi> CaÅ¿tle,
whither the CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners of Parliament were no Å¿ooner arived
with <hi>PropoÅ¿itions</hi> againe, but the <hi>Scots</hi> CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners were at
hand, and for the Å¿ame reaÅ¿on proteÅ¿ted furiouÅ¿ly againÅ¿t Them.
By which inÅ¿olent demeanors and expreÅ¿Å¿ions, from time to
time, and crying up the <hi>Covenant</hi> for their defence, it is clear
enough what their Intentions were when they urged it upon us,
and that notwithÅ¿tanding all the Å¿pecious Pretences of <hi>brotherly
Love,</hi> their DeÅ¿igne in it hitherto hath beene, onely to Å¿crue
themÅ¿elves into an equall IntereÅ¿t with us in this Nation.</p>
                  <p>Having Å¿melt out their <hi>Project</hi> thus farre, give me leave
to trace them on to the end, as briefly as may be. The <hi>Royall
Party</hi> being totally Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿ed, and Å¿o no further occaÅ¿ion to
make uÅ¿e of the <hi>ScotiÅ¿h</hi> Army, the Parliament, with Å¿ome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
made Å¿hift to Å¿end them home into their own Kingdome:
But being defeated of their Aims and expectations, they could
not Å¿o reÅ¿t; having failed of their ends by pretending for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
they reÅ¿olved next to try what they could do upon the
<hi>Kings</hi> Score, and Å¿o the <hi>Grandees</hi> turn'd the <hi>Tables,</hi> in hope of
an <hi>After-game,</hi> by cloÅ¿ing with <hi>Hamilton</hi> upon the <hi>Royall Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt;</hi>
not doubting but if they gained the day this way, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
their Travels with much more Advantage. The <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
like a <hi>noÅ¿e of wax,</hi> apt to be turned any way, Å¿erved this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize
every jot as well as the former, though the DeÅ¿igne
were different from what it was, the <hi>great ones</hi> not caring much
what became of the <hi>Kirk IntereÅ¿t,</hi> Å¿ince they had agreed for the
Å¿ecurity of their owne; which muÅ¿t needs have been very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iderable,
if they could have redeemed the King, and reÅ¿tored
him into the condition of an abÅ¿olute <hi>Monarch.</hi> Therefore the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104589:31"/>
                     <hi>Kirk</hi> Å¿eeing themÅ¿elves left thus in the <hi>Lurch,</hi> thundered out their
CurÅ¿es amaine upon that <hi>Hypocriticall Engagement,</hi> as deÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
to the <hi>Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Grandees</hi> being at a loÅ¿Å¿e in this likewiÅ¿e upon <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s
Defeat, and followed home to their owne dores by the
brave <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Army, were glad to cry <hi>Peccavi</hi> to the <hi>Kirk,</hi> and
alÅ¿o to our <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Commanders, whom they diÅ¿miÅ¿Å¿ed with
many promiÅ¿es of fair Carriage for the future. Within a while
after, a new dore of hope being opened to them by the Å¿uppoÅ¿ed
SucceÅ¿Å¿ion of the late Kings <hi>Son,</hi> They to ingratiate with him,
proclaime him their King; and here the <hi>Grandees</hi> and the <hi>Kirk</hi>
joyning hands againe, become friends, and offer their Service
for his reÅ¿titution, upon Terms of the <hi>Covenant;</hi> which is their
<hi>Plea</hi> now at this very day: So that the <hi>Covenant,</hi> which was
pretended to be framed at firÅ¿t, for the preÅ¿ervation of this <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
and the <hi>Liberties</hi> of the People, againÅ¿t the uÅ¿urpations
of <hi>regall Power,</hi> is; now that the <hi>Scots</hi> can Å¿erve their <hi>deÅ¿igne</hi> no
longer that way, become the Ground of their preÅ¿ent Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
with the <hi>Prince,</hi> and their Presbyterian Brethren in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
for the deÅ¿truction of our <hi>Liberties;</hi> being reÅ¿olved this
way, Å¿ince they have failed in all the reÅ¿t, to trie whether they
can accompliÅ¿h their profane Projects through the <hi>Covenant,</hi> by
inÅ¿inuating themÅ¿elves into places of Honour, Profit, and Power,
that they may domineere in the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ions, as their <hi>PhariÅ¿aicall
PrieÅ¿ts</hi> would over the ConÅ¿ciences of the <hi>EngliÅ¿h.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus having made way, in diÅ¿covering what the deÅ¿igne of the
<hi>Scots</hi> ever hath beene, and is at this InÅ¿tant, under the faire Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> certainly, no man that is maÅ¿ter of an
<hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Å¿pirit, but will abhorre the Hypocriticall pretences and
Encroachments of that perfideous Nation. And therefore now
that all men may beware how they be drawne into an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with them, I Å¿hall (according to my way) manifeÅ¿t firÅ¿t, the
<hi>Improbability</hi> of their SucceÅ¿Å¿e, and then the <hi>Inconveniences</hi>
which muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily follow, in caÅ¿e their deÅ¿igne be Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿eful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
effected.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> As to the <hi>Improbability</hi> of SucceÅ¿Å¿e, conÅ¿ider by way of
CompariÅ¿on, the great difference between the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> and
<hi>ScotiÅ¿h</hi> Soldiery. Ours are heightned with extraordinary Pay,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:104589:32"/>
bravely accompliÅ¿hed, Å¿trong HorÅ¿e, well diÅ¿ciplin'd, veterane
Soldiers, better Spirited by reaÅ¿on of a more generous educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and to all theÅ¿e add the advantage of being <hi>EngliÅ¿hmen,</hi>
and the Reputation of having been Å¿o long <hi>victorious;</hi> let theÅ¿e
conÅ¿iderations be laid in the balance againÅ¿t the <hi>Scots;</hi> freÅ¿h men
(for the main) newly raiÅ¿ed, a People of farre leÅ¿Å¿e generous
Soules, poor in Body, Pay, and other Accommodations, Å¿ave
what they have purchaÅ¿ed by proguing here in <hi>England.</hi> Judge
then in reaÅ¿on what theÅ¿e are able to doe againÅ¿t Å¿o brave an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
that contemns and Å¿corns Them, as having beaten them
with a handfull (in compariÅ¿on of their numbers) home to their
owne dores; an Army, that to all worldly Advantages, hath
hitherto had a Å¿peciall Protection from Heaven, God having
Sealed them for his owne by many miraculous victories and
SucceÅ¿Å¿es, to the wonder of the whole world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> conÅ¿ider that our <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Army are all of a Nation,
Natives, and unanimous eÅ¿pecially upon the appearance of any
<hi>Invaders;</hi> whereas the <hi>ScotiÅ¿h</hi> will be made up of divers Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>RoyaliÅ¿ts</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> that com in purÅ¿uance of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ends; which (for the time that they continue together)
muÅ¿t needs be a cauÅ¿e of many ConfuÅ¿ions and partialities of
CounÅ¿ells, to the prejudice of their EnterpriÅ¿es and Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
a Å¿pring of perpetuall Emulations, that will Å¿oone untwiÅ¿t
the Confederacy; Å¿o that in Å¿hort time they muÅ¿t fall aÅ¿under
like a <hi>Rope of Sand,</hi> and the private Soldiery be diÅ¿poÅ¿ed to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
thoughts of Å¿ome new Engagement, to the ruine of the
firÅ¿t.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We Å¿hall not only be provided for them here, if
they dare be Å¿o unworthy as to invade us; but 'tis like this
<hi>Common-wealth</hi> may find work for them at home, and (to cure
their madneÅ¿Å¿e) divert the humour with <hi>Phlebotomie,</hi> by way of
<hi>RevulÅ¿ion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is like they will be farre from running much ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
to gain SucceÅ¿Å¿e unto the DeÅ¿igne. For, if they provr a little
unfortunate, the humour will alter; one good beating will
make them underÅ¿tand, there is another way of IntereÅ¿t and
Thriving, than under the wings of <hi>Royalty.</hi> It may chance to
make them remember (becauÅ¿e they cannot forget) how long
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104589:32"/>
they have lived without a King in <hi>Scotland,</hi> while the <hi>Grandees</hi>
and the <hi>Kirk</hi> did all; and that the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> have dealt more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouÅ¿ly
to have <hi>no King,</hi> than a Presbyterian <hi>Mock-King.</hi>
One <hi>Rout</hi> (with this conÅ¿ideration) puts them preÅ¿ently into
the humour of a <hi>Republique,</hi> as well as <hi>England.</hi> And then they
will have no more work to doe, but to raiÅ¿e the <hi>Market,</hi> and
get <hi>Chap men</hi> for their <hi>King</hi> to put him off handÅ¿omly, that
they may pay their Army, and goe home again like <hi>Scots.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>LaÅ¿tly, the <hi>Scots</hi> having no juÅ¿t Ground of a Warre againÅ¿t
<hi>England,</hi> can hardly be proÅ¿perous in the Attempt. The <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
can be none, being extinct, as I have proved in the former
part of this <hi>TreatiÅ¿e;</hi> beÅ¿ides I Å¿hall adde one ReaÅ¿on more:
It cannot in common Å¿enÅ¿e be Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to have been intended
as an <hi>eternall</hi> obligation, binding both Nations for ever, or to
bind the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Nation with an implicite Faith, to whatÅ¿oever
the <hi>Scots</hi> Å¿hould expound to be righteous and neceÅ¿Å¿ary, to be
done here for ever by way of Government. But it appeares
intended onely for a certain time, for the proÅ¿ecution of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Ends which were common to both Nations as Affaires
then Å¿tood; and therefore being of a tranÅ¿ient nature, becauÅ¿e
thoÅ¿e Ends (by the alteration of Time, and other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tances)
are found either not poÅ¿Å¿ible or inconvenient, the
obligation expires of it Å¿elf. This being the Å¿tate of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
neither the <hi>Scots,</hi> nor any other Party can found a
Warre upon it in ReaÅ¿on or JuÅ¿tice. If Å¿o, then having no other
Ground for a Warre<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> but CovetuouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, Emulation and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
which (as I Å¿hewed in the <hi>Preamble</hi> of this Chapter)
have been cloaked under the <hi>Covenant,</hi> in all their Ingagements,
the hand of Heaven will aÅ¿Å¿uredly be againÅ¿t them for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriÅ¿tian

of Battell, it displeaÅ¿ed with unjuÅ¿t Wars, that he will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿per
them, though made by his own People againÅ¿t the wicked
that are his Enemies.</p>
                  <p>But there is one example more, which (me thinks) is very
pertinent to our purpoÅ¿e;<note place="margin">2 Sam. Chap. 2, 3, &amp; 4.</note> and that is of <hi>IÅ¿hboÅ¿heth,</hi> the Son of
King <hi>Saul,</hi> who laying claim to the Kingdome after his Father,
by prerogative of SucceÅ¿Å¿ion, made War againÅ¿t <hi>David,</hi> who
was choÅ¿en King by Gods owne appointment: But to Å¿hew that
<hi>Hereditary SucceÅ¿Å¿ion</hi> is no Plea to juÅ¿tifie a Warre againÅ¿t the
Powers that are ordained by him, he placed marks of diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure
againÅ¿t all that took part with <hi>IÅ¿hboÅ¿heth,</hi> Å¿o that in the end <hi>IÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boÅ¿heth</hi>
had his Head Å¿trook off by Å¿ome Commanders of his
own Party, and brought to <hi>David.</hi> Now, I leave this unto thoÅ¿e
that liÅ¿t, to make the Application: And withall, they may doe
well to conÅ¿ider how the <hi>Spaniard</hi> proÅ¿pered in 88. in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaÅ¿ion
againÅ¿t <hi>England;</hi> how ill he hath thrived ever in his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
againÅ¿t the <hi>Hollander:</hi> And as for the <hi>Scots,</hi> I Å¿uppoÅ¿e,
that as it concerns them to conÅ¿ider the Å¿ad example of the late
<hi>Hamiltonian</hi> InvaÅ¿ion; Å¿o they and their Adherents may learn
from all theÅ¿e together, That God will never proÅ¿per them, if
they proceed in their unrighteous Combination.</p>
                  <p>Having Å¿hewn the Improbability of the <hi>Scots</hi> Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿e, I Å¿hall
in the next place diÅ¿cover the great Inconveniences and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
that our Nation muÅ¿t needs undergoe, in caÅ¿e it Å¿hould
happen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> It being evident, that their deÅ¿igne in urging the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
upon us, hath been to inÅ¿inuate themÅ¿elves into an equall
<hi>IntereÅ¿t</hi> with us in our own Nation, it is to be Å¿uppoÅ¿ed, that
having hitherto been defeated of their long-expected Prey, they
come now to proÅ¿ecute it with the greater appetite: And it is
to be preÅ¿umed they will not Å¿erve the King with the <hi>Covenant,</hi>
at an eaÅ¿ier rate than they intended it Å¿hould have coÅ¿t the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:104589:34"/>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is to be feared, this Å¿o much deÅ¿ired <hi>IntereÅ¿t</hi> of
theirs may (if opportunities fall out right for their Turns) be
driven on farther by the <hi>Sword,</hi> than yet we are aware of. A
<hi>Nationall <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>nion</hi> hath been whiÅ¿per'd often among them hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and there's no doubt but they will bid high for it, if ever
they have occaÅ¿ion; And then it muÅ¿t needs be a very fine world,
when we are confounded with a MiÅ¿celany of <hi>ScotiÅ¿h</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿h;</hi>
when <hi>Scots</hi> Å¿hall be Competitors with us in point of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,
vie wealth with us in our own PoÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ions, Honours, and
Dignities; and either impoÅ¿e new Lawes upon us, or alter the
Old, as may make moÅ¿t for their Advantage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That theÅ¿e things may be, is probable enough, Å¿ince
their <hi>King</hi> having no other rewards to give them, it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible
he Å¿hould Å¿atisfie the <hi>Grandees</hi> and Leaders any other way, than
by promiÅ¿ing large acceÅ¿Å¿ions of IntereÅ¿t, with other mens Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
and PoÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ions; even thoÅ¿e men's (perhaps) that are the
<hi>Moderate Sort</hi> of TranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ors; For, in Å¿uch CaÅ¿es it is uÅ¿uall
to Å¿tretch all Offences upon the Wrack, to Å¿upply the neceÅ¿Å¿ities
of the <hi>Conquerour;</hi> and then if this happen, 'tis like a <hi>Scotch
Covenanters</hi> Å¿tomack, will allow no diÅ¿tinction, betwixt <hi>Presbyter</hi>
and <hi>Independent,</hi> but may digeÅ¿t the eÅ¿tate of an <hi>EngliÅ¿h Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanter</hi>
without Å¿o much as a <hi>Scruple</hi> of Regret, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paÅ¿Å¿ion.</p>
                  <p>LaÅ¿tly, it is a very great wonder, Å¿ince the preÅ¿ent <hi>Stage-play</hi>
of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and the <hi>Actors</hi> are brought on this Å¿ide the
Curtain, and we know what they are through all their diÅ¿guiÅ¿e,
and what they aime at, That yet many of our <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Å¿hould be
Å¿o Å¿tupid, as to be led away with their Cheates and Pretences for
a <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Reformation:</hi> AlÅ¿o, Å¿ince it is evident, that their
chief Leaders and Sticklers gape onely after Profit and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and (according to the CuÅ¿tome of all Forreiners in Arms)
will make no difference between Friend and Foe, Å¿o they may Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
their covetous and ambitious Ends; Å¿ince the whole People
likewiÅ¿e muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity be haraÅ¿ed with innumerable Taxes,
to pay the rabble of their Souldiery; certainly, no true <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi>
heart can be Å¿o degenerous, as to forward or countenance them,
in their invading this Nation.</p>
                  <p>Now, for a ConcluÅ¿ion to the whole; that theÅ¿e Particulars
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:104589:34"/>

what aÅ¿Å¿urance they can have, that they Å¿hall not Å¿erve us

and Bodies. All which being conÅ¿idered, you may Å¿ee, how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
we are obliged to our preÅ¿ent Governers, that they
Å¿trove Å¿o mightily againÅ¿t the Å¿tream to prevent Them all in their
Å¿everall DeÅ¿ignings; and what neceÅ¿Å¿ity lay upon them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
that <hi>corrupt IntereÅ¿t</hi> out of Parliament, and to follow the
CounÅ¿ell of the <hi>Poet,</hi> in cutting<note n="*" place="margin">Immedicabile vulnus EnÅ¿e re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidendum eÅ¿t. <hi>Ovid.</hi>

of the whole, by the <hi>Power of the Sword.</hi> By reaÅ¿on of
this neceÅ¿Å¿ary and magnanimous Act, it is, that they have made
ThemÅ¿elves Å¿o many Enemies to the <hi>Presbyterian Party:</hi> For,
the <hi>Scots,</hi> being defeated of their <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> IntereÅ¿t, the <hi>Secluded
Members</hi> of their Hopes and Priviledges, and the <hi>Clergie</hi> of their
<hi>Kirk-domination,</hi> incline all immediately to face about to the
<hi>Prince,</hi> and to hedge in him and his IntereÅ¿t with their owne, as
well as they can, in hope of private Revenge and a Recovery,
without any regard at all to the good and peace of the Publique.
Then <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> if they prevaile, ye will be but in the old poÅ¿ture
again, As You WERE; yea, and far worÅ¿e than you were, Å¿ince
all thoÅ¿e Church-uÅ¿urpations which were then but in deÅ¿igne,
muÅ¿t needs be confirm'd by a new alteration.</p>
                  <p>For this CauÅ¿e it is, there are Å¿o many <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Juglings in
private, Å¿uch Murmurings abroad, and Å¿o many Mutinies in the
<hi>Pulpit;</hi> Å¿uch wel-acted Lamentations for the glory of the <hi>Kirke,</hi>
and the loÅ¿Å¿e of their <hi>Diana,</hi> that every <hi>Prayer</hi> is a <hi>Stratagem,</hi>
moÅ¿t <hi>Sermons</hi> meer <hi>Plots</hi> againÅ¿t the State, and upon their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.
Thus the Nature of their DeÅ¿igne being diÅ¿covered, give
me leave in the next place to manifeÅ¿t the Vanity of their Hopes,
that if men will not forbeare for Å¿hame of its hypocriÅ¿ie, they
may yet, in conÅ¿ideration of the many Å¿ad ConÅ¿equents which
may follow.</p>

                     <p>FirÅ¿t, our <hi>EngliÅ¿h Presbyterians</hi> are very inconÅ¿iderable now
in <hi>England,</hi> becauÅ¿e above three Parts in four are fallen off, Å¿ince
they were able to Å¿ee through the Pretences of the <hi>Grandees</hi>
of their Party, Å¿o that the Å¿mall Remainder can doe little of
ThemÅ¿elves, and all their hope leans upon <hi>Scotland,</hi> that <hi>bruiÅ¿ed

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> As their Party is but Å¿mall of its Self; Å¿o there is
Å¿mall likelyhood of an IncreaÅ¿e, becauÅ¿e all the ReÅ¿t of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

or <hi>RoyalliÅ¿ts.</hi> And though they uÅ¿e all Indeavours

by reaÅ¿on that the old <hi>Antipathie</hi> will revive upon every
little occaÅ¿ion. For, the <hi>RoyalliÅ¿ts</hi> looke upon them Å¿till, as the
Authors of their MiÅ¿ery; and the <hi>Prince</hi> (who is Head of that
Party) though He may feed Them with fair PromiÅ¿es, can never
cordially imbrace them, being the old Enemies of his Family:
Nor will he count them any whit the leÅ¿Å¿e guilty for their hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall
proteÅ¿ting againÅ¿t the Death of his <hi>Father;</hi> For, They
reduced him <hi>Diminutione Capitis,</hi> into the condition of a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
They Å¿poil'd him as a <hi>King,</hi> before others executed him

that the Prince could forget old Injuries, and that the neceÅ¿Å¿ities
of the chiefe of his Party Å¿hould bring down their Stomacks to
a compliance with <hi>Presbyterie;</hi> yet the main Body of that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
will never comply, in a courÅ¿e Å¿o deÅ¿tructive to every mans
IntereÅ¿t of ConÅ¿cience and Liberty; nor venture their Lives and
EÅ¿tates to eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h a <hi>Faction,</hi> which they beleeve to aÅ¿pire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
an intolerable Tyranny, over MagiÅ¿trates and People.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>LaÅ¿tly,</hi> the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> ThemÅ¿elves may doe well to conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

                     <p>But to illuÅ¿trate this a little, give me leave to cloÅ¿e up this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
with a notable exampleâIt hapned that <hi>Clearchus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">This Story is recorded by <hi>Machiavel,</hi> in his firÅ¿t book <hi>de Repub.</hi>
                        </note>
the Tyrant of <hi>Heraclea,</hi> was by a ConÅ¿piracy of the <hi>Grandees</hi>
driven out of his Dominions, they hoping when he was gone
to have all power in their owne hands; but there Å¿tarted up a
Party of the People, which prevented them, and Å¿etled the State
in a condition of Liberty and Freedome. Hereupon, the <hi>Grandees,</hi>
in diÅ¿dain and revenge againÅ¿t this new Party, conÅ¿pired againÅ¿t
the Common-wealth, and brought back <hi>Clearchus</hi> into poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The <hi>Tyrant</hi> being thus reÅ¿tored, inÅ¿tead of gratifying them
that had a hand in his reÅ¿titution, conÅ¿ulted to Å¿atisfie both
his owne Revenge upon them, for having oppoÅ¿ed him at
firÅ¿t, and alÅ¿o the diÅ¿contents of the People againÅ¿t them, for
their having deprived them of their late Liberty: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the reward they received for bringing him back was, that
he Sentenced them all to a moÅ¿t Å¿hamefull Execution. This is
the <hi>Story,</hi> and now I leave thoÅ¿e <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> that dreame

And in proceÅ¿Å¿e of time, this heat of Presbytery proved Å¿uch an

is only this; That they would not have a <hi>King</hi> Å¿o much as in

                     <p>

                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> that I may give you a little more light in theÅ¿e Things,
conÅ¿ider, that the ReaÅ¿on why the <hi>Presbytery</hi> contended for is

in helping to reduce the one, and purge the other; yet no
Å¿ooner had the Parliament recovered it Self into a State of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
and Freedom, and begun to act in Å¿uch a way, as they
conceived neceÅ¿Å¿ary to eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h the liberties of the Nation, but
theÅ¿e men made bold to carp at their Proceedings, and crie out
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:104589:40"/>

                  <p>From whence it appears, the firÅ¿t CauÅ¿e of the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Parliament and Them, was their bold and impudent
behaviour, in preÅ¿uming to direct their wiÅ¿dome what to doe,
and taking upon them, <hi>Dictator</hi>-like, to define what is <hi>Liberty,</hi>
and what not, and how it ought to be eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed; as if Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves

Freedom,</hi> and the Parliament Å¿uch, as either regarded it not,

carrying on the work of <hi>Freedom</hi> to this height, wherein we

Them in their Proceedings, as OppreÅ¿Å¿ors of that <hi>Liberty</hi> which

yet it wants not (of it Å¿elfe) thoÅ¿e many Advantages, above all
other Forms, which render it moÅ¿t convenient to promote the
Peace, wealth, and honour of the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Nation.</p>
                  <p>Yet it is a wonder to Å¿ee, how lightly men prize this invalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Jewell of <hi>Liberty,</hi> which hath coÅ¿t the Common-wealth Å¿o

their Feet, like <hi>Swine;</hi> Å¿o that the Parliament meet now with
as many difficulties to preÅ¿erve, as ever they had to purchaÅ¿e it.
But for this, there are two Å¿peciall ReaÅ¿ons, which may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected

                     <hi>Florentine</hi>'s Å¿ubtile diÅ¿courÅ¿es upon <hi>Livy;</hi>

as other BeaÅ¿ts that are abroad; and if they be let looÅ¿e,
yet they will returne in againe, becauÅ¿e they know not how to
value or uÅ¿e their <hi>Liberty:</hi> So Å¿trong an ImpreÅ¿Å¿ion is made
likewiÅ¿e, by education and CuÅ¿tome from the <hi>Cradle,</hi> even upon
men that are endued with reaÅ¿onable Souls, that they chuÅ¿e to
live in thoÅ¿e Places and CuÅ¿tomes of government, under which
they have been bred, rather than Å¿ubmit to better, which might
make more for their Content and Advantage. Hence it is, that
thoÅ¿e poore Slaves under the <hi>Turk, PerÅ¿ian, Tartar, MuÅ¿covite,
RuÅ¿Å¿ian, French,</hi> and <hi>Spaniard,</hi> with other <hi>EaÅ¿tern, Northern,</hi>

they admire their own condition above all others, and (like the
<hi>Indians)</hi> adore the <hi>Devill</hi> which torments them, becauÅ¿e they
are ignorant of a better Deity to protect Them.</p>
                  <p>But beÅ¿ides <hi>education</hi> and <hi>cuÅ¿tom,</hi> under another <hi>Form,</hi> there is
a <hi>Å¿econd ReaÅ¿on</hi> why men are Å¿o degenerous in Spirit, as to vaÅ¿Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
ThemÅ¿elves, and neglect the maintenance of their <hi>Liberty;</hi>
and that is, a <hi>generall Corruption and Depravation of manners,</hi>
by luxurious CourÅ¿es, when a Nation is even Å¿wallowed up with
Riot and Luxury; Å¿o that being Slaves to their owne LuÅ¿ts, they
become the more eaÅ¿ily inÅ¿laved unto the LuÅ¿ts of another. The
Truth of this may be obÅ¿erved in the variation of the <hi>Roman</hi>
State; which in its primitive innocence, was Å¿o Å¿enÅ¿ible of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi>
that when <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Colatinus</hi> had once expell'd the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quins,</hi>
the People all moÅ¿t readily joyned with then as one man,
in defence of their <hi>Freedom;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Florus.</note> yea, they were Å¿o zealous of it for a
long time, that no Relations or ConÅ¿iderations whatÅ¿oever
of former merits, could availe with them to Å¿pare thoÅ¿e that
attempted ought againÅ¿t it: For, when the Sons of <hi>Brutus</hi> were
found guilty of a conÅ¿piracy, to bring back the <hi>Tarquinian</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
They condemned them to death, and their own <hi>Father</hi>
was as forward as any, to bring them to Execution: So the
famous <hi>Manlius</hi> likewiÅ¿e, to whom <hi>Rome</hi> owed both her Å¿elfe
and <hi>Liberty,</hi> being by him preÅ¿erved againÅ¿t the <hi>Galls,</hi> in the
greateÅ¿t extremity, was notwithÅ¿tanding, upon a diÅ¿covery of
his after-Intent to Å¿urprize their <hi>Liberty,</hi> thrown headlong
down the <hi>Tarpeian</hi> Rock, within view of the <hi>Capitoll</hi> which he
had Å¿o nobly defended. By which Actions you may perceive,
that when <hi>Rome</hi> was in its pure eÅ¿tate, vertue begat a deÅ¿ire of
Liberty, and this deÅ¿ire begat in them an extraordinary Courage
and ReÅ¿olution to defend it; which three walked a long time
hand in hand together, and were the CauÅ¿es, that the firÅ¿t Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of their <hi>Freedome</hi> had Å¿o little difficulty, in maintaining
themÅ¿elves, againÅ¿t thoÅ¿e InvaÅ¿ions which hapned afterward, by
the <hi>Tarquins</hi> and their <hi>Royall Confederates.</hi> But in proceÅ¿Å¿e of
Time, when the <hi>Romans</hi> had loÅ¿t that ancient vertue, which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaÅ¿ed
their <hi>Liberty,</hi> and an <hi>Empire</hi> over the world; being
Å¿oftned in their manners, and conquered by their vices whoÅ¿e
Dominions they had conquered, they Å¿oon bowed under the

yoke of <hi>Imperiall Tyranny;</hi> And though there appeared after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Å¿ome Å¿parks of ancient courage and love of liberty among
Them, when They took off <hi>CaeÅ¿ar</hi> himÅ¿elfe, <hi>Caligula, Nero,</hi>
and in the end rid ThemÅ¿elves quite of that Tyrannicall Stock
of the <hi>CaeÅ¿ars</hi> yet (I Å¿ay) becauÅ¿e thoÅ¿e <hi>Sparks</hi> were kindled
only in a few of the more noble Soules, and the generallity cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt

                  </p>
                  <p>It is obÅ¿ervable alÅ¿o in all times, the <hi>Northern</hi> and more manly
People, that have no Acquaintance with luxurious Diets and
Apparrell, nor care much to obtain Them, nor to taÅ¿te of thoÅ¿e
melting Enchantments of more wanton Nations, are endued
with a greater courage and Sence of Liberty; whereas thoÅ¿e
People that inhabit the delicate parts of the world (as in <hi>AÅ¿ia,</hi>

They ever have lived, and do (for the moÅ¿t part) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue

that Å¿ince they had accepted the <hi>Regall</hi> or <hi>Imperiall</hi> Form of

him blindly from the hand of Chance or Fortune: Nor doe I

taking Governers at Adventure, without reÅ¿pect of wiÅ¿dome or

of it, that it is the only way to prevent the Inconveniences

Å¿ince it hath cauÅ¿ed ten thouÅ¿and times more bloody DiÅ¿putes

of the Family. The <hi>Turk</hi> (we Å¿ee) alÅ¿o allows an equal Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to <hi>ChriÅ¿tians</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> yet his Empire hath long continued

the Å¿ame likewiÅ¿e in Å¿everall <hi>ChriÅ¿tian</hi> dominions; as <hi>Poland,
TranÅ¿ylvania, Hungary,</hi> and even in the ProteÅ¿tant Dominions
in <hi>Germany.</hi> Yet the experiment is brought nearer home to us

Å¿uch a meaÅ¿ure of Peace, Plently, and Liberty, as is not to

they Å¿everely puniÅ¿h Å¿uch as offer to diÅ¿turb their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
about any matter relating to <hi>Religion. Thirdly,</hi> becauÅ¿e
they Å¿uffer not that Religion to be evill Å¿poken of, which is
publiquely profeÅ¿Å¿ed by the <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>State:</hi> whereby it is
implyed, that a <hi>Toleration</hi> of different opinions in Religion,
can be no prejudice to the Peace of a Nation, Å¿o long as
theÅ¿e Rules are obÅ¿erved; but rather a grand PreÅ¿ervative of
publique Quiet; whereas perÅ¿ecutions for matter of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
have ever been all the world over the great Incentives of
Sedition. And Å¿ince it is of unavoidable neceÅ¿Å¿ity, that (while
the world Å¿tands) there will be diviÅ¿ions of Opinion, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
Å¿uch a courÅ¿e muÅ¿t needs be moÅ¿t rationall, which Å¿hall
provide waies of remedy againÅ¿t Å¿uch Inconveniences as may
follow them, rather than Inventions of Torture and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to thwart and Å¿tifle Them; becauÅ¿e the <hi>understandings</hi> of
men can no more be compelled than their <hi>Wills,</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
what they like not. So that from hence it appears
plainly, the great pretenders of <hi>Nationall <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>niformity</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
thoÅ¿e high imperious <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>niformity-mongers,</hi> that would

to Å¿ubmit to <hi>every Ordinance of Man;</hi> by which (according

where, according to the old <hi>Greek</hi> Copies, we read,
<hi>[To all Å¿uper-eminent Powers]</hi> and in the old Latin <hi>[Be ye

<hi>[To every ordinance of man]</hi> it is meant to every Power which
is Å¿et over men, to all MagiÅ¿trates, as well as to Kings, and
whereas he Å¿aith, <hi>to the King as Å¿uper-eminent,</hi> it is to be noted,
that EpiÅ¿tle was written from <hi>Babylon;</hi> and Å¿o the Å¿ubjection
muÅ¿t be meant then of the King of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> to whom he
willed the ChriÅ¿tians in the Provinces of that Countrey to be

affirms there is a debt of Subjection due unto them from the
People. So likewiÅ¿e doth <hi>Paul,</hi> in his fore-mentioned Chapter
to the Romans, and gives the reaÅ¿on, why we Å¿hould Å¿ubmit to

without the Å¿afety of our Governers. But what were
thoÅ¿e Governers which the ApoÅ¿tle commanded us to pray for?
Certainly, they were <hi>Tyrants</hi> by UÅ¿urpation, that ruled in a
tyrannicall manner, haters of the true Religion, PerÅ¿ecutors and
Idolaters. Yet this was the Rule, this the Law, this the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.
And, as he obÅ¿erves, <hi>Pag.</hi> 197. <hi>Christ</hi> himÅ¿elf was
content to be born, to live and pay obedience, to acknowledge
their Authority in matter of Tribute and Judicature, and at laÅ¿t
to be condemned injuriouÅ¿ly, and Å¿uffer death moÅ¿t Å¿hamefully,
under a tyrannical uÅ¿urped Government.âMuch more he
hath to the Å¿ame purpoÅ¿e; but let this Å¿uffice out of one of their

(as our <hi>AntagoniÅ¿ts</hi> would Å¿uppoÅ¿e, though as yet they never
