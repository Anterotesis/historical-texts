            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>You take care, that the building ſhould be well ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated; and for the foundation, I may preſume by what hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready paſt between you and me, that we are long ſince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed.</p>

               <p>That the threefold Balance or Diſtribution of Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, is the cauſe of the triple way of Government, I fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with you; as alſo, that the Balance now in <hi>England</hi> is in the people plainly, and excluſively, both to a King and Lords.</p>

               <p>It is true, that if they can have nothing elſe, they muſt at length have a Commonwealth; but though they can have nothing elſe to be holding, yet they will be trying other things.</p>

               <p>VVhy then there is not ſuch difference between the growing of a Plant and of a Commonwealth, as you thought; ſeeing a Commonwealth knowing as little, doth no leſs.</p>

               <p>With no more addition, then that the people in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſtinct diviſion elect annually two Knights and ſeven De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties.</p>

               <p>I dare ſay the people would never ſtick at this.</p>

               <p>Come, I will have you try ſomething of this kinde, and begin upon ſome known principle, as this, <hi>All power is in the people.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>Content. But the diffuſive body of the people (at leaſt in a Territory of this extent) can never exerciſe any power at all.</p>

               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>That is, the people of themſelves being in a natural incapacity of exerciſing power, muſt be brought into ſome ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial or political capacity of exerciſing the ſame.</p>

               <p>Right, Now this may be done in three ways; as firſt, by a ſingle perſon.</p>

               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, I am not likely to trouble you much upon this point: but as you were intimating very now, there are Royaliſts who derive the original right of Monarchy from the conſent of the people.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>There are ſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>And theſe hold the King to be nothing elſe, but the Repreſentor of the People and their Power.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>As the Turk.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, as the Turk.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>The peoples power at that rate comes to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſlavery.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>You ſay right; and ſo it may at other rates too.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>As how?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>Why as I was about to ſay. The power of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may be politically brought into exerciſe three ways: by a ſingle perſon, by an Aſſembly conſiſting of a few, or by an Aſſembly conſiſting of many.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>Or by a mixture.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, I pray you let that alone yet a while: for which way ſoever you go, it muſt come at length to ſome mixture, ſeeing the ſingle perſon you named but now, without his <hi>Divan</hi> or Council to debate and propoſe to him would make but bad work even for himſelf. But as the Government cometh to be pitched fundamentally upon one of theſe three, ſo it differ's not only in name, but in nature.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>I apprehend you, as Monarchy, Ariſtocracy and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, you are out with your learning, when you have forbidden it me. But in Countries where there is not a Nobility ſufficiently balanced or enriched, there can be none of your Ariſtocracy; and yet there may (as long as it will laſt) be a Government in a few.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>What call you that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, what ſay you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>Come, it is Oligarchy: when all is done, ſome words of Art we muſt uſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>I thought you would come to it; and yet ſeeing I have promiſed, I will be ſparing. But with your pardon, you
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114992:6"/>
have diſordered my Diſcourſe, or by this I had ſhewed, that if the Power of the people be committed to a ſingle Perſon, the common intereſt is ſubmitted unto that of a Family; and if it be committed to a few, it is ſubmitted to the intereſt of a few Families.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>Which ſo many times as they are more then one, is ſo many times worſe then Monarchy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>I am not ſorry that you are of that mind. For there is no ſuch thing as a Commonwealth, or as you ſay Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy in nature, of it be not pirched upon a numerous Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the people.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>What call you numerous?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>Why an Aſſembly ſuch for number, as can neither go upon the intereſt of one ſingle Perſon or Family, nor the intereſt of a few Perſons or Families.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>How will you conſtitute ſuch an Aſſembly?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>Commonwealths for the conſtitution of their Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Aſſemblies, have had two waies. The firſt by inrolling all their Citizens, and ſtating the <hi>Quorum</hi> in ſuch ſort, that all to and above the ſtated number repairing at the time and place appointed, are impowered to give the Vote of the whole Commonwealth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>The Athenian <hi>Quorum</hi> was ſix thouſand; which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the latter end of that Commonwealth, came to five.</p>

               <p>Put the caſe I ſhould ſay, ten thouſand?</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>I would not go above five thouſand.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>Mark you then; they only that are neareſt, would come; and ſo the City of <hi>London</hi> would give Law unto the whole Nation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>Why really that ſame now is clear; but would there be leſs danger of it, in caſe you ſtated your <hi>Quorum</hi> at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>You ſhall ſee preſently.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>Of what number will you have this Repreſentative?</p>

               <p>Why thus: let the people in every Precinct or Shire at Election chuſe four, under one hundred pounds a year in Lands, Goods or Money, together with three at or above that proportion.</p>

               <p>How do you order your changes?</p>

               <p>It doth ſo. But to reſpite that a little, I ſhould be glad, before I ſtir farther, to know which way the Vote of a Repreſentative thus conſtituted, can go one hairs beſide the common and publick intereſt of the whole diffuſive body of the people.</p>

               <p>No Humane Ordinance is infallible; and what is done through meer ignorance or miſtake, at one time, will be

               <p>A thouſand men, and ſix to four of the lower ſort, perpetually extant! this muſt be a grievous charge to the moſt of them; it will be hard to bring them, and impoſſible to hold them together.</p>

               <p>Not, with the reſt of the Pomp of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, unto three hundred thouſand pounds a year.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Why? the Kings have rarely had above ſix.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>I muſt confeſs the quarrel grew, when they would not be contented with ſo little.</p>

               <p>Now if <hi>England</hi> never did, nor needed grudge a King of ſix hundred thouſand pounds a year, to be ſpent among Courtiers; why ſhould we imagine ſhe ſhould grudge a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of three hundred thouſand pounds a year, to be ſpent among Magiſtrates?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>But Parliament-men have taken nothing.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>Have the people given nothing?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>That was for the maintenance of Armies.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>And whether had you rather maintain Armies or Magiſtrates?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>But putting the caſe, that this Aſſembly needed not to be perpetually extant, this charge in the whole or in the far greater part might be abated.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot tell: for how often think you fit that this Aſſembly ſhould convene?</p>

               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>If they had been perpetually extant, there would have been no King.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>No truly, except in name only.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>Therefore the popular Aſſembly in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, ought not to be perpetually extant.</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>Mock not; or what other guard of liberty is there in any Commonwealth, but the popular Aſſembly?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Come, let them aſſemble twice a year upon their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary guard.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>How much will this abate of their neceſſary charge, or of the Salaries? And how much better were it for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative to lead the life of States-men then of Carriers?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>Commonwealths, whoſe Aſſemblies have been of the former kind, have called them no otherwiſe then at ſtated times, or upon extraordinary occaſions.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>But then their Aſſemblies were not equal. Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, but conſiſted of ſuch as being next at hand were ſtill ready upon any occaſion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>That makes indeed a conſiderable difference. But were this Repreſentative always extant, I cannot ſee but it would have nothing to do.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>And in caſe it be not always extant, you imagine that it may have ſomething to do.</p>

               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>Yes.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>Then whether goeth it better with the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth when the Repreſentative hath ſomething to do, or when it hath nothing to do?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>This is very quaint.</p>

               <p>No truly, <hi>Valerius,</hi> it is plain, that the guard of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty perpetually extant, in doing nothing, muſt do much; and not perpetually extant, in doing much may do nothing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>I am affraid that having nothing to do, they will make work.</p>

               <p>Nay, I am not ſo wide. A civil Council and a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Army muſt needs have intereſts much more diſtinct, then two civil Aſſemblies; and where there is not like cauſe, I know well enough there cannot be the like affect.</p>

               <p>Nay, it is you that put me to it; for you will be preſuming that this Aſſembly can have nothing to do, before we come to conſider what are their proper buſineſſes and Functions.</p>

               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>Why ſurely no ſmall matters: for in every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth truly popular, it is inſeparable from the Aſſembly of the people, that firſt they wholly and onely have the right of reſult in all matter of Law-giving, of making peace and War, and in levying men and money. Secondly, that the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Reſult in Judicature lie unto them; and thirdly, that they have right to call unto account, and to puniſh their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates for all matter of Male-adminiſtration of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <p>Certain it is, that in ſome Commonwealths the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Aſſembly by this means, hath been perpetually em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.</p>

               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>It might; but I do not think it would: However, if it be in the undoubted right of the popular Aſſembly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt their Magiſtrates for Male-adminiſtration, would you leave it upon the hand of thoſe Magiſtrates, whether this Repreſentative ſhould aſſemble or no?</p>

               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>Come, you have ſaid enough, it were not prudent: but as to the matter of Appeals it is certain that in <hi>Iſrael</hi> the ultimate reſort was to the Sanhedrim or 70 Elders.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I know it very well: nevertheleſs you ſhall find that the Congregation judged <hi>Benjamin;</hi> and if you mark the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114992:9"/>
appeal unto the 70 Elders, you ſhall find that it was not an appeal of the party for relief, but of the Judges in inferiour Courts for further light and direction in difficult caſes of the Law.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Let me but know in what manner this Aſſembly is to perform theſe Functions, and I have done.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>Why as to matter of Law-giving, I told you that they wholly and onely have the right and power of reſult.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>But to Reſult, there muſt neceſſarily go precedent Debate; ſeeing a man, much leſs an Aſſembly, reſolveth not upon any thing without ſome Conſiderations, Motives or Reaſons thereunto conducing, which ought to be firſt order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and maturely debated: and how will you bring a thouſand men, eſpecially being ſix to four of the lower ſort, to debate any thing with order and maturity?</p>

               <p>And I ſaid true.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Yet this debated: why may not one thouſand men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate as well as five thouſand men?</p>

               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>As well! Nay <hi>Publicola,</hi> if they debate no better in your Commonwealth then they did in that, you may know what will become of it. And to tell you true, I do not think that one thouſand men can debate any whit more orderly and maturely then five thouſand.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>So there muſt be a Senate; which amounts unto thus much, without a Senate there can be no Commonwealth; and with a Senate, there will always be practiſing upon the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the people.</p>

               <p>They would not derive ſo immediately, nor riſe ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually from the people, as choſen in the precincts; becauſe this way every Shire cometh neceſſarily to have a ſhare in the Senate: beſides, wiſe men and underſtanding are better known in their Tribes, then they can be in an Aſſembly out of their Tribes; eſpecially while they are new comers: nor will the popular Aſſembly afford ſo good choice as the whole people.

               <p>I hear them talk of making a co-ordinate Senate firſt, and without the people, and then of aſſembling a Parliament in the old way to govern with that Senate.</p>

               <p>Then to reaſon. I ſay, That the Senate aſſuming power, the popular Aſſembly falls immediately to debate; and the popular Aſſembly debating, the Senate is <hi>ipſo facto</hi> depoſed, there being no other neceſſary uſe or function of the Senate, but debate only.</p>

               <p>Nay, if there be ſome occaſion in which you allow that the popular Aſſembly muſt and ought to debate, there will hardly be any in which they will be perſwaded that they may not. So this will come to the pulling down of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, as often as the people pleaſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>Which is ſo much the rather to be feared, becauſe you ſhall never find that popular Aſſembly, which did ever actually depoſe their Senate.</p>

               <p>I little doubt but there is in your form a full ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unto the people of their liberty; but do you think that there is in it any full ſecurity, that the people ſhall not caſt off this form?</p>

               <p>What is it then that any Government can be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently founded or balanced upon, but ſuch an intereſt as is ſufficiently able to bear it?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>Good Sir, a Government ought to be founded upon Juſtice, I take it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>Right: and is not that Government which is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon an Intereſt not ſufficiently able to bear it, founded upon injuſtice?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>I ſuſpect whither this will go. A Government foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the over-balance of propriety, is legitimately foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? and ſo upon Juſtice; but a Government founded upon the under-balance of propriety, muſt of neceſſity be founded upon force, or a ſtanding Army. Is not this that which you mean by Intereſt ſufficient or not ſufficient to ſuſtain a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment?</p>

               <p>Riſes me up one of the Senators, and ſaith, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> This Nation hath been long in labour, but now through the mercy of God, the child is not only come to the birth, but there is alſo ſtrength to bring forth: in the number of Counſellours there is ſtrength; the number of this Houſe is good (far better then hath uſually been of late) and their Election hath been very free and fair. Here is alſo, I know not how (but the inventions of men are over-ruled by the providence of God) an extraordinary and exceeding great confluence of honeſt men, who are not ſo well here; and if you determine any thing that is good for your Country, will go home and pray for you. Now Sir, (to be brief) ſince our Government conſiſted of King, Lords and Commons, the antient, the only, the moſt happy Government that this Nation, nay, that the World ever knew, it is but too well known, that we have had no Government at all: wherefore my opinion is, that we propoſe (as they call it) unto theſe honeſt men (who you need not doubt will receive it with glad hearts) the reſtitution of right, and of the Government in this Nation by King, Lords and Commons. As ſure as you live, <hi>Publicola,</hi> thus much being ſaid, your whole Senate will immediately agree to propoſe it unto the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative: and thus much being propoſed unto the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, thoſe people will throw up their Caps for joy, and forthwith return unto their houſes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>But <hi>Valerius,</hi> thus much hath been ſaid in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when the houſe was fuller; when they who were for this reſtitution, were backed by a ſingle Perſon in actual poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Throne; when over and above the zeal of Presbyterians, there were parties that knew no other means of ſelf-preſervation; as without Divines adoperating the Oak
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114992:14"/>
of every Pulpit; and within, Lawyers and Salary-men: yet was it ſo far from being carried, that the ſingle perſon hath been forced to diſſolve Parliaments, and that through appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent danger of being over-run by the principles of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth not in being. But if this were ſo when a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth could ſcarce be hoped, what will it be when the Commonwealth ſhall be in ſuch a condition as cannot be withſtood? for the Senate can never come to propoſe any thing unto the people, without firſt agreeing upon debate, what it is that they will propoſe; nor is it poſſible that ſuch debate ſhould be brought unto any end, but by reaſons thereunto conducing: now it muſt not only be impoſſible to find reaſons for the reſtitution of Monarchy, but the reaſons why Monarchy ought not to be reſtored, muſt be obvious; not only in regard that it is quite contrary to the intereſt of the Nation, and of theſe Aſſemblies, but to the intereſt ten to one of every particular man in either of theſe Aſſemblies: nor are or have the reaſons been leſs obvious, or leſs venti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in Parliament, why Monarchy as to this Nation is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible in itſelf.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>Will you ſay the like for liberty of Conſcience?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; becauſe without liberty of Conſcience, civil li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty cannot be perfect; and without civil liberty, liberty of Conſcience cannot be perfect.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>Theſe things are true, but they will never ſee them, never, <hi>Publicola:</hi> you your ſelf ſay, That the people cannot ſee, but they can feel.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>I meant that of the diffuſive body of the people, not of the people under good Orders; in which caſe they are the ſharpeſt ſighted, of any kind of Government whatſoever: and therefore it is not modeſt, that you or I, or any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man or party, blinded with ſelf, ſhould pretend to ſee with ſuch a conſtitution; or ſhew me that eye under the Sun, that ſees like that of <hi>Venice.</hi> But putting the caſe it were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe as to ſeeing, theſe things are plainly palpable or obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto feeling.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>I have indeed obſerved, that in Commonwealths there are very few that ſee or underſtand them, and yet their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114992:15"/>
affection unto that way of Government is exceeding vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>Whence then can this otherwiſe be, then from feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? But one thing, <hi>Valerius,</hi> I take at your hands extream heavily.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>What is that, <hi>Publicola?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>That you with one little ſpeech of a ſingle Senator, ſhould run ſo regardleſly over theſe two Aſſemblies, without taking any notice at all of the neceſſary courſe of them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>What courſe, <hi>Publicola?</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>Why you might eaſily have thought, that among three hundred Senators there might have been at leaſt one hundred as good Speakers as yours.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>Have I ſaid any thing to the contrary?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>And do you or I what we can, ten to one of them will be longer winded then you have allowed.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>For that matter, let them pleaſe themſelves.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>I but then you ſhould not have made an end of your debate in a minute.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>What is all this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>Why I ſay, They would have been debating upon that point at leaſt a fortnight.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>Well, and when that had been done, would never have agreed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>No.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>Did not you ſay that before?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but I am now upon another point; that was to the matter in debate, this is to the manner of proceeding: imagine the matter had been ſuch upon which they could have agreed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>VVhat then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>Then ſuch an agreement had been a Decree of the Senate.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>Is a Decree of the Senate binding?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>If it be upon Law made, it is binding; if upon Law to be made, it is to be propoſed unto the people. Now every Propoſition to the people is to be promulgated, that is, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and publiſhed to the whole Nation, ſix weeks before the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114992:15"/>
time that the Repreſentative is to aſſemble and give the Vote of the Commonwealth, or that teſt without which no ſuch Propoſition can be any Law.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>By this means it muſt follow, that the whole people both by diſcourſe and letters, debate ſix weeks together up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>You are right.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>How is it then that you ſay, The Repreſentative of the people muſt not debate? allow you unto theſe leſs privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, then unto the whole people?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>No leſs, nor in this point any more.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>Yet amounteth this to debate in thoſe that are of the Repreſentative.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>You ſay well, but not unto any debate at all in the Repreſentative.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>Why this Repreſentative is nothing elſe but an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument or Method, whereby to receive the reſult of the whole Nation, with order and expedition, and without any manner of tumult or confuſion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>And is that any thing the worſe?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>No; but I am glad you have told it me: for, that thoſe of the Repreſentative would one way or other have debate, I knew certainly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>In ſum, are you ſatisfied, that the ſpirit of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the people, however they may now under no form at all, and in deteſtation of ſuch as having governed them by force, will let them ſee no way out of confuſion, deſire their old Government, as having never yet known any other; yet under ſuch a form as is propoſed, can never go about to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce Monarchy, without obvious diſcovery, that as to their intereſt, it is quite contrary, and as to it ſelf impoſſible?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>The ſatisfaction is pretty good.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>Pretty good! give me but half ſo good, that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Army, not formerly obedient unto Parliaments, and now dreading or deſpiſing them, muſt apprehend the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Monarchy to be quite contrary to their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>You ſurprize me: for if the Army will have no Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114992:16"/>
and a King reſtored can now in <hi>England</hi> without an Army have no Government, they may imagine this their only way unto greatneſs and continuance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>Had not the Oligarchy then, if they meant well, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have uſed ſober expreſſions, and minded what thoſe true and real intereſts are, which in the foundation and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of every kind of Government are Paramount, then to have overcaſt them with the miſt of new affected phraſes, and fallen on conjuring up ſpirits?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>You have conjured up a ſpirit will keep me waking.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>Set him on pulling down the Law and the Miniſtry; when that is done, let him blow-up <hi>Winſore</hi> Caſtle, <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, and throw <hi>Whitehall</hi> into the <hi>Thames.</hi>

                           <p>I Say not that the form contained in the Petition (if we had it, and no more) would be perfect; but that without thus much (which rightly intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, introduceth the reſt) there neither is, was, nor can be any ſuch thing as a Commonwealth, or Government without a King and Lords, in Nature.</p>
                           <p>Where there is a co-ordinate Senate, there muſt be a King, or it falleth inſtantly by the People; as the King failing, the Houſe of Peers fell by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
                           <p>Where there is a Senate not elective by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, there is perpetual feud between the Senate and the People, as in <hi>Rome.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>To introduce either of theſe cauſes, is certainly and inevitably to introduce one of theſe effects; and if ſo, then who are Cavaliers, I leave you to judge hereafter.</p>
                           <p>But to add farther reaſon unto experience. All civil power among us (not onely by Declaration of Parliament, but by the nature of propriety) is in and from the people.</p>
                           <p>Where the power is in the people, there the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> can Legitimately be no more unto the Popular Aſſembly, then my Counſel at Law is to me, that is, <hi>(auxilium, non imperium)</hi> a neceſſary aid, not a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titor or rival in power.</p>
                           <p>Where the aids of the people become their rivals
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114992:18"/>
or competitors in power, there their <hi>Shepherds</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Wolves; their Peace, diſcord; and their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ruine. But to impoſe a ſelect or co-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Senate upon the people, is to give them rivals and competitors in power.</p>
                           <p>Some perhaps (ſuch is the temper of the times) will ſay, That ſo much humane confidence as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, eſpecially in the Petition, is Atheiſtical. But how were it Atheiſtical, if I ſhould as confidently foretel, that a Boy muſt expire in non-age, or become a man? I Propheſie no otherwiſe; and this kind of Prophecie is alſo of God, by thoſe Rules of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which in the known Government of the World are infallible. In the right obſervation &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of theſe, conſiſteth all humane wiſdom; and we read <hi>(Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 14.) that a poor man delivered a City by his wiſdom; yet was this poor man forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. But if the premiſes of this Petition fail, or one part of the concluſion come not to paſs accordingly, let me hit the other mark of this ambitious Addreſs, and remain a fool upon Record in Parliament to all <hi>Poſterity.</hi>

               <p>Well, I will ſay it in Engliſh then. Though there neither be any houſe of gold, nor ever were any houſe of gold, yet there may be an houſe of gold.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>That I can, now you have taught me. If there were no ſuch thing as gold in nature, there never could be any houſe of gold.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>

               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>That which I have long ſince proved, and you gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; The balance: the diſtribution of propriety, and the power thence naturally deriving; which as it is in one, in a few, or in all, doth neceſſarily diſpoſe of the form or frame of the Government accordingly.</p>

               <p>Be the foundation or materials of an houſe what they will, the frame or ſuperſtructures may be diverſly wrought up or ſhapen; and ſo may thoſe of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>

               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>True: but let an houſe be never ſo diverſly wrought up or ſhapen, it muſt conſiſt of a roof and walls.</p>

               <p>Why then the preſent poſture of the earth is other then it hath been, yet is the earth no new thing, but conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of Land and Sea, as it did always; ſo whatever the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent poſture of the Heavens be, they conſiſt of Star and Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, as they did always.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>Why I ſay, If it conſiſted of the ſame matter with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Stars, it was no new thing in nature, but a new thing in <hi>Caſſiopoeia;</hi> as were there a Commonwealth in <hi>England,</hi> it would be no new thing in nature, but a new thing in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

               <p>The Star you will ſay in <hi>Caſſiopoeia,</hi> to have been a new thing in nature, muſt have been no Star, becauſe a Star is not a new thing in nature.</p>

               <p>At <hi>Putzuoli</hi> neer <hi>Naples,</hi> I have ſeen a Mountain that roſe up from under water in one night, and poured a good part of the Lake antiently called <hi>Lucrine</hi> into the Sea.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
               <p>VVhy that the new and extraordinary generation of a Star, or of a Mountain, no more cauſeth a Star, or a Mountain to be a new thing in nature, then the new and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary generation of a Commonwealth, cauſeth a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth to be a new thing in nature. <hi>Ariſtole</hi> reports, that the Nobility of <hi>Tarantum,</hi> being cut off in a Battel, that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:114992:19"/>
Commonwealth became popular. And if the Powder-Plot in <hi>England</hi> had deſtroyed the King and the Nobility, it is poſſible that popular Government might have riſen up in <hi>England,</hi> as the Mountain did at <hi>Putzuoli.</hi> Yet for all theſe, would there not have been any new thing in nature.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>Some new thing (through the blending of unſeen cauſes) there may ſeem to be in ſhuffling; but nature will have her courſe, there is no other then the old game.</p>

               </gap>, an Horſe and no Horſe, with the Tayl ſtanding where the Head ſhould ſtand: which when all came to all, was a Mare, with her Tayl ty'd to the Manger; the lively Emblem of an Oligarchy. Mr. <hi>Stubbe</hi> pretending to ſhew his Learning, takes thoſe things (as it were changing the ſex of them) which I have written, and in his writings turns their tails unto the Manger. Now this, as to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned Reader, is that upon which it is to no purpoſe to move any controverſie; and as to the learned, I need no more then appeal, whether in their proper ſtables, or in the beſt Authors, the heads of them ſtand, as I have ſet them, or the tails as Mr. <hi>Stubbe</hi> hath ſet them. Only let me ſay, That as to a ſelect Senate (underſtanding thereby a Senate not elected by the people) there is no more of this in all ſtory, then the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> only. Whence it is undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by any man of common underſtanding, that a ſelect Senate bringeth in a ſelect intereſt, that a ſelect intereſt cauſeth feud between that ſelect intereſt, and the common intereſt, and ſo between the Senate and the popular Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; which coal in <hi>England</hi> it is fitter for ſuch as Mr. <hi>Stubbe</hi> and his Patrons to blow, then for ſuch as underſtand ſtory, Government, or common honeſty. But their Reaſons who decry the poſſibility or plauſibility of ſuch Acts or Orders as theſe, it pleaſeth him to call high <hi>Rodomontado's.</hi> Now which are the higher <hi>Rodomontado's,</hi> theſe, or thoſe which he uſeth in flouriſhing <hi>the Juſtitia of Anagon,</hi> (a patch in a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, which his deſign is to tranſlate by <hi>a ſelect Senate,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Commonwealth) I leave any man to judge, even by the teſtimony of his own Authour <hi>Blanca,</hi> and in a place ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by himſelf, though not ſo well rendered. <hi>Our anceſtors</hi> (ſaith <hi>Blanca) have three ways ſecured our liberties; by the Juſtitia, by the great POWER of the Ricos hombres</hi> (now he ſpeaks) <hi>and by the priviledge of the union. The firſt was a civil and forenſick curb</hi> (a gown) <hi>the ſecond was a domestick, and more restraining one</hi> (I think ſo the purſe, and thence the

power) <hi>the third popular and warlike,</hi> an excellent Militia, Now let any man ſay, even after <hi>Blanca,</hi> if without the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, in whom was the balance of this Monarchy; and their retainers and dependants, of which conſiſted the Militia, this Court of the poor Gown-man called <hi>Juſtitia,</hi> muſt not have been a very likely thing to reſtrain a Prince; or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether without this ſame Mummery of the <hi>Arragoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> Houſes of Peers and of Commons in other Monarchies, have not every whit as much reſtrained their Kings, and more, ſeeing this toy (as at every election of the Magiſtrate called <hi>Juſtitia,</hi> it received not breath but from a King) was blown away by a King. His other inſtances, as the thirty ſix <hi>Curators of the Publick</hi> appointed unto <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh of <hi>France,</hi> by the three Eſtates, and the <hi>twenty five ſelect Peers,</hi> given unto King <hi>John</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> were like ſhifts, and had leſs effect. Security in Government muſt be from entireneſs of form; and entireneſs of form, muſt be from ſoundneſs or rightneſs of foundation. But Mr. <hi>Stubbe</hi> founding himſelf upon the Authority of <hi>Ariſtotle, That the Weſtern parts are not capable of a right Commonwealth,</hi> is declaredly for a wrong Commonwealth in <hi>England.</hi> He minds not, that <hi>Venice,</hi> for the capacity, is a righter Commonwealth then was ever any in <hi>Greece;</hi> nor that the preſent State of <hi>England,</hi> is of a far different, if not a quite contrary nature to that of the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern parts, in the time of <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi>
