            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I am not worthie to be compared with the least ofthe seruants of God, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at that time, in which he powred the giftes of his holy spirit from heauen so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly. Howbeit, as it pleased him to rayse Steuen to <hi>dispute with some of the Iewish Synagogue</hi>: so hath he vouchsafed me of this fauour, that I should be called to conferre with certaine ofthe Popish Seminaries. Of whom, one, contented to proceede farther therin then the rest; by writing, not by word onely: hath giuen occasion ofthis, which here I publish. Wherein how indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he hath bene dealt with: himselfe hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ehold (gentle Reader) the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which thou hast so long loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for, betweene M. Rainoldes and me, at length ended: as also it had beene more then twelue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes since, had not my selfe hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of it foorth, when it was nigh readie to be deliuered to the Printer. For it is now aboue two yeares ago, that the right honorable, Syr <hi>Francis Wal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>singham,</hi> as he had shewed me great fauour from the time that I was apprehended, in graunting me libertie of conference at home, first in mine owne countrie, and afterwarde in prison: so, when the sentence of death was past vpon me, hee ceased not still to offer me the same fauour if I would admit it. VVhich I, grounding my selfe vpon the most certayne foundation of the Church so strengthened by God that it shall stand for euer, did gladly yeeld to, and (as became me) accepted of it with all dutie. VVherevpon his Honour sent for <hi>M. Rainoldes</hi> to conferre with me: taking order also that I should be furnished with whatsoeuer bookes I did neede thereto. But after we had spent certayne
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:15991:6"/>
weekes together in conference by word of mouth, and I continued still in my former mind: he desired to haue the summe thereof in writing, that he might see the groundes on which I stood. And to this intent we set downe together breefe notes of the points that we dealt in: I shewing my reasons with the places of the autours whose iudgement and learning I rather trusted too, then to my owne skill; and <hi>M. Rainoldes</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them in such sort as he thought good. Howbeit, those notes being so short (as pointing to thinges ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then vnfolding them) that they could not well bee vnderstood by any, but our selues onely, vnlesse they were drawne more largely and at full: my selfe being troubled then with more necessary cogitations of death, (as altogether vncertaine when I might be called to yeeld vp mine account before God and man,) requested <hi>M. Rainoldes</hi> to take paines to penne them according to our notes thereof. Promising him that I would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use it when he had doon it, and allow of it, if it were to my mind; or otherwise correct, if I misliked ought in it. This paines he vndertooke, and sending me the partes thereof from time to time as he finished them, I noted such thinges as I would haue added, or altered therein, and he performed it accordingly. But when I perceiued that it was prepared to be set foorth in print: I sought meanes to stay it all that I could, for some considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:15991:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which seemed to me very great and important. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry since that againe vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding it to be his Honours pleasure that it should go forward, wherevnto he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me also by speciall warrant the vse of such bookes as I should call for to helpe my selfe withall: I set afresh vpon it, &amp; by letters written vnto <hi>M. Rainoldes</hi> &amp; receiued from him, I had mine owne speeches &amp; reasons perfitted, as I would. VVherefore, I acknowledge that he hath set downe herein a true report of those things which past in conference betweene vs, according to the grounds and places of the autours, which I had quoted &amp; referred my self too.

               </note> in one place, that <hi>I haue told him, that my opinion is, the Pope may not depose Princes</hi>: in deede I told him so much.

VVherevpon I gather as a certaine conclusion, that the opinion of them, who holde the Pope to be a temporall Lord ouer Kings &amp; Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is vnreasonable and vnprobable altogether. For he hath not to meddle with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or theirs ciuilly, much lesse to depose them or giue away their kingdomes: that is no part of his commission. He hath in my iudgment the Fatherhoode of the Church, not a Princehood of the world: Christ himself taking no such title vpon him,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:15991:7"/>
nor giuing it to Peter, or any other of his disciples. And that is it which I meant to defend in him, and no other soueraintie. Humbly desiring pardon of her Maiestie, my gratious soueraine Lady, for my plaine dealing in that, which (so Christ helpe me) I take to be Gods cause, and the Churches only. As I do also most willingly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my selfe to the curteous correction of all men, who, through greater skill, and perfitter iudgement, see more then I doe in the depth of these matters whereof I haue conferred. Farewell, gentle Reader: and now that I haue shewed thee my dealing herein, let me obtaine this little request at thy handes, that thou be not too hasty in giuing thy iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, before thou hast weighed all things sincerely and vprightly. </p>

               <p>In deede I did signifie so much to M. <hi>Secretarie:</hi> neither am I vnwilling to do that I haue promised. Howbeit, I wish rather, that if a conference be purposed, the learned men of our side, whome we haue many beyond sea, might be sent for hether, of riper yeares, and sounder iudgement. As for mée: the condition of conference with you is somewhat vn-euen. For I lie in prison, and am adiudged to dye: the closenesse of the one, &amp; terror of the other, doth dull a mans spirits, and make him very vnfitte for study. I neither am of great yeares, nor euer was of great reading: and yet of that which I haue read I haue forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten much, by reason of my long restraint. I am destitute of bookes: we are not permitted to haue any at all, sauing the <hi>Bible</hi> onely. You of the other side may haue bookes at will: and you come fresh from the vniuersitie: whereby you are the readier to vse them and alleage them. These are great disaduantages, for me to enter into conference with you. Neuerthelesse, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as I haue said, to do it: so that my wantes may be supplied with furniture of bookes, such as I shall desire.</p>

               <p>This conclusion hath neither foundation, nor head.

                  <hi>the wall had twelue foundations, and in them the names of the Lambs twelue Apostles.</hi> Then séeing that the church was built vpon euerie one of those twelue, as vpon <hi>Iames</hi> by name, and <hi>Peter</hi> was a part of the church: it foloweth that <hi>Peter</hi> was built vpon <hi>Iames</hi>; and so was <hi>Iames</hi> his foundation.

               <p>But we do imagine, that in this building of the church

               <p>Indéede you doo imagin it. And you consider not that your imagination is crossed by it selfe, not onelye by the truth.

ioint-foundations of the church, laid on Christ, the onely and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular foundation, to speake of a foundation properly.

For the onely person that the church is built on, as on a foundation (by the strength and vertue whereof it is vpholden) is <hi>the sonne of God,</hi> our Sauiour <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>: beside whom <note n="z" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11.</note>

               <p>I haue weighed them, and I find them to light. The marchant, whom you praise, is rich, I denie not: but sure he vseth false weights, and abuseth the simple, who take their wares vpon his credit. Poore men, conceiuing well of them whom they fansie, thinke him to deale vprightly for that he raileth at others, saying that <hi>they are deceauers, because they will not be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest dealers, and good children of the weale publike.</hi> But let his words go: and haue an eie to his weights. If you shoulde tell a yoong beginner in shooting that they who looke at the marke and louse directly towards it do not alwaies hit it: your speech were a truth. But if you should say that all naughtie archers which are, or euer were, haue fowlly missed the marke in aiming at it most straightly: he might suspect either your skill, or your will, who traine vp archers so. What may we thinke then of him
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:15991:50"/>
who to perswade men that conference of scriptures is a deceitfull way to hit their right sense, doth say that <hi>all heretikes both of this and of all ages, in conferring the scriptures most dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently togither yet haue erred in the sense of the scriptures most shamefully?</hi> For though they might erre in conferring of them: yet the fault thereof must be, not in conferring them <hi>most diligently,</hi> but in not conferring them diligently enough. And this is the last of your Doctors reasons. The next before it is no better. He saith, that <hi>there are many places in the scripture, which haue not any like wherewith you may conferre them.</hi> The proofe he bringeth of it, is, that <hi>there are sundry speeches in S. Paule, which are in no Prophet, nor Apostle beside him: as</hi> (for example sake) <hi>to put of the olde man, and put on the newe.</hi> Which proofe is like the point whereof it maketh proofe. For, if the same speeches be not in any other, yet there are speeches lyke them, whereby they may be vnderstood. Or, if not in others: yet in <hi>S. Paule</hi> himselfe, who lightneth so his owne speeches. Or, if not in him: yet conferre them with the drift and circumstances of the text; the course of thinges and wordes will open what is meant by them. And so alleage what place of scripture you list, the darkest that you can: let a man expound it after our rules, and it will neuer leade him into heresie. For either it hath plaine pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to expound it, and being expounded according vnto them, it is farre from heresie: or if it haue no such, it hath no danger of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, because all things required to beliefe and life are set downe plainely in the Scriptures. The daunger all lyeth in your first and second point: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one, touching sayinges, <hi>that mens corrupt affections may iudge vnlike or like, when in truth they are not so:</hi> the other touching <hi>wordes, that may bee mistaken through mens ouersightes, as signifying the same thing, or sundry, which they do not.</hi> And by these meanes we grant that the scriptures, may be (and are of many) expounded amisse: to the verifying of that which <hi>S.</hi>

Nay, so much the more should we labour and trauaile to search it most diligently, and wisely to conferre it: to wrest by that meanes their <hi>sword</hi> out of their handes, and kill their owne errour with it.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:15991:56"/>
both the powers, not onely of iurisdiction but of order too. And that may be gathered (it seemeth) by the text. For it is said as generally to the Apostles, What things soeuer ye shal bind: as it is to Peter, What thing soeuer thou shalt bind.</hi>

               <p>No. But he bringeth your opinion in deede by way of an obiection, and frameth thereunto an answere, and so resolueth to the contrary. For thus he goeth forward. <hi>What? Is that giuen then to all the Apostles, which was promised to Peter? Caietan (in his treatise of the Popes authority) saith that the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, and the power of byndyng and loosing, are not all one: for that to bynd and loose is lesse then to open and shut. But this doctrine seemeth to be more subtill then true. For it is a thing vnheard of, that there are in the Church any other keyes then the keyes of order and of iurisdiction. And the sense of those wordes, I will giue thee the keyes, and whatsoeuer thou shalt bind and loose, is plaine: that first, a certaine power and authoritie is promised; afterward, the function of it is declared. Now the function of these keyes is declared by the wordes to bind and loose, not by the wordes, to shut and open: that we may vnderstand they be metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall and borowed kindes of speeches; neither heauen is ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned properly, but it is said that heauen is opened then with these keyes when men are loosed and dispatched of the difficulties and infirmities which shut them out of heauen,</hi> and so forth.

               <p>God forbid. To great purpose: though not to yours. For he giueth him therein a commandement, though not a commission.

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:15991:74"/>
                  <hi>now one brother helped an other</hi>: the king calling to mind his brother <hi>Alfreds</hi> death, whom the Earle had slaine, beheld him with a displeased countenance, and said, <hi>So might my brother also haue holpen me, if thou hadst not beene.</hi> In the which storie, <hi>the cup-bearer</hi> who stumbled, doth shew that one foote may strengthen an other, and stay them both that they fall not: <hi>the Earle,</hi> who obserued therein a brothers duetie, doth shewe, that the younger may strengthen the elder, or the elder the yoong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: <hi>the king,</hi> who remembred his owne estate by it, doth shewe that the inferior may strengthen the superior, yea the member the head.

For I shewed that the former argueth his weaknesse; the later openeth his duetie; but neither proueth any preeminence at all, saue a preeminence in frailtie. The truth is, that Christ in those wordes dooth thrée things: whereof one is a byle, and therefore you touch it not.

               <p>This testimonie of <hi>Chrysostome</hi> dooth stand on two branches: the one, what Peter doth, as the Scripture shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; the other, what he might haue done, as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth.

But it proueth not the supremacy. <hi>He remembreth his duetie; hee speaketh first of all; he doth all things by the common aduise and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Disciples, and nothing by his owne authoritie.</hi> Thus much I saide of <hi>Peter,</hi> and did explane it out of <hi>Duaren.</hi>

In <hi>Duaren</hi> you thought that it made against you, and therefore refused him. Dooth it make for you, when it is in <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> that you bring him against <hi>Duaren</hi>? Or, is this the reason, why you accept the one and refuse the other, because the wordes of <hi>Chrysostome</hi> yelding a certaine <hi>primacy</hi> to Peter, may deceiue the simple, as though he meant <hi>that primacy</hi> which you call <hi>the supremacy:</hi> but the wordes of <hi>Duaren</hi> put so plaine a difference betwéene the two primacies, that, which Peter had; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which the Pope hath, or would haue; that a blinde man may sée that Peters primacy was not a Popes supremacy.

               <p>This answere doth not weaken the strength of mine argument.

But <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> as I take it, as <hi>Paule</hi> gaue it to <hi>Peter,</hi> is vsed in his proper sense: to signifie a reuerence, the which an inferior doth owe to a superior, a subiect to him that is in power aboue him.</p>

               <p>The <hi>honor</hi> which <hi>husbands</hi> are bound <hi>to giue vnto their wiues, as to the weaker vessels,</hi> doth signifie an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest care and regard of bearing with their weakenes, prouiding for their wantes, and shewing all husbandly loue and duetie to them. Such a reuerence as you mention it doth not signifie, I graunt: yet doth it signifie a reuerence which is implied in the loue and duetie that their husbands owe them. <note n="q" place="margin">

the authoritie of the teachers: they said, it was the doctrine of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and <hi>the rest, the chiefe of the Apostles, the pillars</hi> of the Church.

We must with great heede obserue and remember the doctrine of this place: that when we see words of the Prophets or Apostles brought foorth by any men against the Catholike faith, we way be assured by this great example of the authoritie of the Gospel, that the Deuil doth speake by them.</hi> Thus saith that auncient Father, <hi>Vince<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>You may not cary so the wordes of <hi>Vincentius</hi> away in a cloude. For, though he may séeme to haue meant in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall by <hi>[the tradition of the Church]</hi> the expounding of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures according to the rule of their right and Catholike sense, which the Pastors of the Church deliuer: yet comming to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars he frameth that rule, not out of the scriptures, but out of the opinions which the Church holdeth in matters of religion. For, <note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vincent. Lirin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cap.</hi> 38.</note> he asketh him selfe, <hi>when heretikes pretend scriptures, what shall the Catholikes doo? How shall they discerne the truth from falshood in the scriptures?</hi> Whereto he maketh an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that <hi>they must take the scriptures in the sense of the Church: and therein they must folow, vniuersalitie, antiquitie, consent.</hi> By the which <note n="k" place="margin">

                     <hi>and</hi> 4.</note> thréefold meanes to trie the truth, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structeth vs that <hi>we must hold that, which the church of our time doth hold through all the world vniuersally. If a part of Christendome diuide and cut it selfe from the faith of the whole: then are we bound to folow the whole, and not the part. If the whole in our time be stained with any error: then must we haue respect to the former time, and cleaue to anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie. If all in antiquity agreed not about it: then looke too consent; as, what a generalll Councell did decree therof</hi>; or, <hi>if no such decree be, what all the Fathers thought, or if not all, what the most, euen they who continued in the faith and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of the Catholike Church.

               <p>I liked his iudgement in the generall point,

touching <hi>the sufficiencie and perfitnes of scriptures</hi>: which (I know) you like not, though you make greater semblaunce of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him, then I. If in the particulars I mislike somewhat, let the blame be laid vpon the blame-worthy: not me, who stand to that which he hath spoken well; but him, who falleth from it. For, laying his foundation as it were, on a rocke: he buildeth vp his house beside it, on the sand. That <hi>scripture is sufficient, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, against heretikes, so that it be taken in the right sense, expounded by the rules of the Catholike faith</hi>: this hath hée well auouched, as on the rocke of Gods word. But, that <hi>the rules of faith, and sense of the scripture must be tried and iudged by the consent, antiquitie, and vniuersalitie of the Church</hi>: this hath he added not so well, as on the sand of mens opinions.

               <p>But the circumstance of the place doth rather import it to be the very same.

vnlesse he did it of purpose, to shew, what now <hi>the Romanes</hi> be: or some corrector chaunged it, least wee by this circumstance should find the place of <hi>Cyrill.</hi> For, this <hi>[where he expoundeth the epistle to the Romanes]</hi> is a great argument, that the Councell meant the place in the twelfth booke: where <hi>Cyril</hi> doth handle such pointes of <hi>that epistle</hi> as concerned the matter that he had in hand. Which that he should doo againe, in the same worke, with the same sentence, touching the same matter: they who know <hi>Cyrill,</hi> will not thinke it likely. The lesse, because it is an vsuall thing with the Grecians, to diuide bookes otherwise then the Latins doo. As, in the Gréeke testament, <hi>the gospell of S. Marke</hi> hath more then fortie chapters, which hath not twentie in the Latin: and yet notwithstanding the Latin hath the whole, as well as the Gréeke. Which is the more likely to haue béene the difference betwéene the Gréeke <hi>Cyrill,</hi> alleaged by the Councell, and our Latin <hi>Cyrill</hi> translated out of Gréeke, because that our Latin hath also other sentences in the tenth booke, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged <note n="q" place="margin">

               <p>That sense is the right sense of the scriptures, which the holy Ghost, the author of them, meant. Now, the holye Ghost hath vttered them in such sort, that not the wordes onely do signifie things, according to their naturall sense: but the things also expressed by the wordes do signifie other things, according to the Lordes ordinance, who shadowed that by figures in the olde Testament, which is performed in the newe. As, for example, it is writen in <note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.46.</note> the law of <hi>Moses, you shall not breake a bone of him.</hi> These wordes are spoken touching the lambe of the passeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer:
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:15991:121"/>
and signifie, as they sound, that the Iewes should dresse it whole, without breaking any bone thereof. But this thing doth signifie a fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ther thing in secret: to wéete, that when <note n="k" place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>Christ,</hi> who was represented &amp; figured by the lambe, should suffer death to saue vs, <hi>a bone of him should not be broken.</hi> Thus, of one place there are two senses: the former called <hi>literall,</hi> because the letter, as it were that is the very wordes, being vnderstood aright, do import it; and the later, <hi>mysticall,</hi> because the thing imported and meant by the letter, doth betoken a déeper mysterie. Of these, the literall sense is knowne to be the meaning of the holy Ghost. For wordes were made to open the conceites of our mind: and so are they vsed by the holy Ghost to shew the will of God vnto vs. The mysticall is known to be his meaning also, when him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe reuealeth it: as he hath done in that touching <hi>the lambe.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise it is not. For men may deuise many mysticall senses of a place in scripture, and them, one contrarie to an other: as often times they doo. Which all could not be meant by the Spirit of truth: and whether any of them were, who can say? We haue no assurance then of mysticall senses: which may be mens fansies. Onely the literall sense, which is meant vndoubtedly by the holy Ghost, is of force to proue the assured truth, and therefore doth binde in matters of beliefe.

               <p>I know that the misticall senses of the scripture are of no strength to conuince an aduersarie. But the literall sense of that which I alleaged doth proue the point in question. For there lyeth often times, within the literall, an other sense hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: which is not directly vttered, and plainely, but is gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and inferred by the force of argument. As, for example, <note n="s" place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.6.</note> God said to comfort <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Israelites, I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob.</hi> These wordes in the first sense, doo signifie the couenant that God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and with <hi>Abrahams seede,</hi> whom hée chose to be <hi>his seruants,</hi> and promised he would bée <hi>their God.</hi> But <note n="t" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.32.</note> Christ alleageth them to proue (against the <hi>Sadduces</hi>) the <hi>resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the dead.</hi> Which he doth conclude by conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of reason. <hi>God is not the God of the dead, but of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</hi> He is <hi>the God of Abraham</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> is <hi>not dead. Abraham</hi> is a man consisting of two partes, the soule and the bodie.

               <p>Yes: and is of force to proue the point in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie. For whatsoeuer followeth necessarily of the literall sense: that is as true and sound as the sense, whereof it followeth. But how will you gather so the Popes supremacie from the

               <p>By a reason, which I ground vpon the likenes and proportion of the Church of Christ to the children of Israell. For if the Israelites had a <hi>high Priest</hi> to be their <hi>iudge</hi> in matters of difficultie and doubt, <hi>betweene blood and blood, betweene cause &amp; cause, betweene plague and plague:</hi> why should not we semblably haue a hie Priest to bée the iudge in our causes?</p>

               <p>This reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is drawn from a similitude: that, as it was amongst the Iewes in the olde Testament; so must it bée amongst Christians in the new.

               <p>It is probable enough, as Father <hi>Robert</hi> handleth it.

               <p>The <hi>Councell</hi> declareth that there were some copies of a former Councell, that had bene corrupted by heretikes among the Greekes. But, as euill dealing doth still leaue steppes behind it, whereby it may be traced out, <note n="o" place="margin">

Father <hi>Robert</hi> did dreame out of <hi>Onuphrius,</hi> that hee had said so. But, although <hi>Onuphrius</hi> say more in that point then truth did afford: yet he saith not that.

For the learned Catholikes, albeit they graunt that <hi>Honorius</hi> was an heretike and condemned iustly by the sixth generall Councell: yet they hold that <hi>Christ prayed</hi> for the Pope, and that therefore the Pope cannot erre; but how?

So, the Pope is priuileged from falling into errour by the prerogatiue of his office, through the ordinance of Christ: that would haue all Bishops and Pastors of the world to depend on him for their confirmation in faith and ecclesiasticall regiment.

The which that wee may receiue, that is, <hi>learne,</hi> God hath giuen vs two senses: the hearing, and the sight. Wee heare wordes: we sée déedes. The ministers of Christ, whom he hath ordeined <hi>to teach</hi> the wisedome of his Father, the way to life eternall, ought <hi>to teach</hi> by both: that men maye be edified by their wordes, which they heare; and by their déedes, which they sée.

Because thou shewest me the worke so, as if it could not be done. For I thinke with my selfe, if thou who spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest so great things, doost them not: much more am I to be excused, who speake no such thing.

               <p>That reason holdeth not. For many speake the truth, who can lye, if néede be: and many speake the truth in some thinges, who in all thinges doo not. Christ respecteth that which the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharises</hi> did ordinarily: they read the law in the Synagogues; they willed the people to obserue it; yea, in outward thinges, as ceremonies, tithes, purifyings, and sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats, they did exact it most straitly.

Now, to punish the wicked, is to doo them good, For (as naturall reason taught <note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Plat. in Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia.</hi>
                  </note> a Philosopher) vices in the mind, are, as diseases in the bodie; and punishments, as medicines. So that, as for a sicke man to drinke a bitter po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or to be launced, or seared, it is good, though it be grieuous: in like sort, to be punished, is for a lewd person. Therefore when the Israelites did punish and <hi>destroy the inhabitants of Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>: they did not <hi>hate</hi> them in so dooing; at least they were not charged to hate them. For, <hi>to hate</hi> a man, is to wish him euill. To punish an offender, is to doo him good. The charge of the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites was that they should punish them. In that they were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore charged to <hi>destroy</hi> them, they were not charged to <hi>hate</hi> them. And this is yet plainer by the new Testament. Where, though <note n="m" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44.</note> we be charged to hate no man liuing, but to <hi>loue</hi> all: yet <note n="n" place="margin">

And so did they too, when they taught, that euill and sinfull affections are not forbidden by the law. You say they taught lesse therein then the law, but they taught not against it.

                  <hi>the lawful succession was disordered then</hi>: he meant that it was broken but in some sort, as it were; or (to say the truth) rather brused, then broken; not interrupted, but disturbed.

               <p>There were many tumultes and schismes in the Church, chiefely through the Emperours meanes, before that the matter could be brought about to that perfection and ripenes which it is now at. But things began to mend from that time of disorder. For by the vertue of <hi>Leo</hi> the ninth, and the Popes folowing, that vsurpation was taken from the Emperor <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth, although with great sturres. And so was the Sée A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolike of Rome restored to her auncient brightnes and beauty. Whereof our owne daies haue séene the proofe and triall in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good Popes, elected lawfully, no doubt: <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth, and him who raigneth now, <hi>Gregorie</hi> the thirtéenth, a most louing father of the Churches children.</p>

               <p>The matter is so great, that the tracke thereof will find vs out that, which by this distinction you séeke to steale away.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Rainoldes.</speaker>
               <p>Because <hi>a Prince is, as it were, a physician of the common wealth: and a physician can not erre, as physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. For in that he erreth, he misseth of his arte. Wherefore, by want of physicke he erreth, not by physicke. And so (to speake exactly) no artificer can erre: at the least he cannot erre as an artificer. For he which erreth, erreth because he hath not skill enough, and not because he hath skill.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hart.</speaker>
               <p>But yet an artificer may erre in practise of his arte: as a physician, in curing sicke men: a Prince, in ruling the common wealth. And therefore, me thinketh, that shift is but a quidditie. For an artificer may be iustly saide to erre as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer, when he doth erre in that which he dealeth with in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his arte. At least, if he erre not therein as an artificer, he erreth as an euill artificer.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Rainoldes.</speaker>
               <p>That is true, as an euill artificer.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Hart.</speaker>
               <p>Then your man in <hi>Plato</hi> must amend his spéech: and say, that a Prince may erre as an euil Prince, though he cannot, as good; and a magistrate, as an euill magistrate.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Rainoldes.</speaker>
               <p>And of a physician he must amend it too: and say, that a physician if he cure not the sicke wel, doth erre as an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill physician.</p>

               <p>Likewise if an auditor doo misse in casting of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts: he erreth as an euill auditor.</p>

               <p>True: and likewise the like.</p>

               <p>Is not the Pope a Bishop? the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> I trow.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hart.</speaker>
               <p>I thought that hether you would at last. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I did purposely except him by name. For it is true in all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, saue in the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Rainoldes.</speaker>
               <p>I know you did except him: but with what reason? For if it be true in generall of Princes, that they may erre as Princes; it foloweth in speciall that any Prince may erre as Prince: the Quéene of <hi>England,</hi> as Quéene; the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as King; the <hi>German</hi> Emperour, as Emperour; and so forth all the rest, whose office is Princely. This you graunt. Doo you not?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hart.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, it is so in Princes, I graunt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Rainoldes.</speaker>
               <p>Then, in like sorte, if it be true of Bishops that they may erre as Bishops, it foloweth that any Bishop may erre as Bishop: the Patriarke of <hi>Venice,</hi> as Patriarke: the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of <hi>Alba,</hi> as Cardinall; the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> as Pope; and so forth all the rest, whose office is Bishoply. Doth not reason teach you, that you must graunt this also?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hart.</speaker>
               <p>No. Because the state and condition of Bishops is not like to Princes in this consideration. For amongst Princes there is none priuileged by vertue of his office not to erre, as Prince. But amongst Bishops the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is priuileged not to erre, as Pope.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Rainoldes.</speaker>
               <p>The date of this priuilege is out, <hi>M. Hart</hi>: it cannot serue you now. For your selfe misliked <hi>Thrasymachus</hi> in <hi>Plato</hi> as shifting with a quidditie, for saying that <hi>a Prince cannot erre as Prince.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hart.</speaker>
               <p>And I mislike him still.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Rainoldes.</speaker>
               <p>You confessed also, that an artificer may be iustly said to <hi>erre as an artificer,</hi> when he doth erre in that which hee dealeth with in respect of his arte.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hart.</speaker>
               <p>I did so. What then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Rainoldes.</speaker>
               <p>And you thought it méete, that we should say <hi>a
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:15991:180"/>
Bishop erreth as Bishop,</hi> when he erreth in a peint of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops dutie.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Hart.</speaker>
               <p>And this I graunt too.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Rainoldes.</speaker>
               <p>How can you deny then, but the Pope may iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be saide to erre as Pope, when he erreth in a point of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes duty? And sith a point thereof, is, <hi>to diuide the word of truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,</hi> belonging to him, as to all Bishops, by the <hi>chaire</hi> &amp; seate, that is, the office of teaching, wherin God hath set them: the Pope is not priuileged by vertue of the chaire from erring as Pope, more then all Bishops are priuileged as Bishops. That, if an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bishop may erre notwithstanding as Bishop, which you graunt: you must néedes graunt the Pope may also erre as Pope. Yea, though all Popes were <hi>pastors</hi> or <hi>hirelinges,</hi> and none of them <hi>theeues</hi>: yet might they erre as Popes too. For <hi>S. Austin</hi> and <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> erred, as Bishops. Yet they were <hi>pastors</hi> both.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hart.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, the Pope certainly can not erre as Pope, that is to say, in office: though he may in person, as Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> did.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Rainoldes.</speaker>
               <p>Nay in Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> you are cast certainly. For I haue proued now that he wrote that as Pope, which he was condemned for: and therefore erred as Pope.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hart.</speaker>
               <p>It may séeme he wrote it as Pope, &amp; so erred. But that is not enough to proue that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope may erre in office, as I take it.</p>

               <p>I speake not of their doctrine now, but of their office. In two pointes whereof you graunt that they may erre. The third is as manifest.

               <p>Nay, if he be sicke, it is his duetie then not to preach by him selfe. God hath layed an other duetie vpon him, to

looke to his health that he may do his former duetie: or, (if his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time be fulfilled,) to thinke vpon a higher duetie. But by this reason no Christian is bound to come to Church by him selfe. For he is not bound if he be sicke extremely. Neither hath the Pope néede to preach by others.

and specially of his domesticals: he hath denyed the faith, and is worse then an infidell.</hi> Wherefore you must consider that the Pope susteineth a double person as it were: the one of a Prince, the other of a Bishop. As a Prince, he gouerneth his temporall dominion: as a Bishop, his spirituall. His spirituall charge is all the churche of Christ: his temporall, a part of it. And so, though both of them concerne after a sorte the state of the Church: yet his affaires spirituall, which stretch through all Christendoom, doo differ from his temporall, which touch the Church of Rome chieflie. For example, <note n="q" place="margin">

                  <hi>Leo</hi> the ninth, a verie good Pope, aboue fiue hundred yeares since, when the <hi>Normans</hi> spoiled the land of the Church and he had cursed them for it, but could not conquer them by curses: he got of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror a strong band of soldiours, whom he lead in person himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the varletes, and met them in the field manfully. At the same time <hi>Michael the Patriarke of Constantinople</hi> denyed the supremacie of the Church of Rome, and claimed it to his own Sée. Whereof when Pope <hi>Leo</hi> heard, he sent thrée legats to Constantinople, to root out that heresie. Now the former of these thinges he did as Prince, against the <hi>Normans,</hi> who set vpon his temporall dominion with armes: the later, as Bishop, against the <hi>Patriarke,</hi> who taught heresie, a point of his spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all charge. Affaires of this later sort let me name (for difference sake) <hi>the Church-affaires</hi>; the former, <hi>the affaires of state.</hi> And so it shall appeere, what iniurie you doo them, whom spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully you call <hi>Herodes.</hi> For you say that <hi>the affaires which they are busied about, are their affaires of state.</hi> Whereas in verie truth <hi>the affaires of the Church</hi> doo busie them a great deale more: to sée that the Catholike religion be taught, that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors be suppressed; to prouide dioceses of good and learned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and parishes of able pastors: to heare appeales, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine causes, receiue supplications, excommunicate the wicked, absolue the repentant: to doo the whole function of supreme heades of the Church. And may not these <hi>affaires</hi> so weightie in charge, in number so manie, bee a iust excuse for them if they preach not?

When Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Leo</hi> the third, desirous to abolish the worship of Images (which then was créeping in) had caused them to be defaced, and thereupon did punish some who withstood it: <note n="s" place="margin">

For, as <hi>Samuell,</hi> when the <hi>Israelites</hi> would haue <hi>a king to rule them,</hi> (as other <hi>nations</hi> had,) <note n="i" place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.11.</note> tolde them that <hi>the king, who should raigne ouer them,</hi> would play the king with them, and theirs; <hi>hee would take their sonnes and appoint them to waite vpon him, to bee his horsmen, footemen, captaines, to eare his land, to reape his haruest, to make him instruments of warre, &amp; instruments to serue his charets; he would take their daughters to dresse him sweete ointments, and be his cookes, and bakers; hee would take their fieldes, and vineyardes, and oliue trees, the best, &amp; giue them to his seruants; yea the tenth of their seede, and of their vineyardes, &amp; giue it to his courtiers, and to his seruants; he would take their men, their maydes, their youth, their cattel, &amp; put them to his worke; he would take the tenth of their flockes; and, to conclude, they should be his seruants</hi>: euen so, when the Pope had gotten the kingdome, that is, the suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, ouer the Israelites of God, that is, Christians; he tooke their sonnes &amp; daughters, nay their fathers and mothers, who should beget them in the gospell, and féede them with the milke of life, and appointed them to serue him, to be his Chauncellors, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers, Secretaries, Maisters of requestes, Clerkes of the Esche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, Legates, in peace to goe on embassages, in warre to looke vnto his armies; he tooke their bishoprickes, and benefices, and prebendes, the best, and gaue them to his seruants, yea the first fruites and tithes of their liuings, and gaue them to his Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

and to his seruants; he tooke their pastours, their doctours, their elders, their deacons, and put them to his worke; hee tooke the tithe of their Churches, nay their whole Churches; and, to conclude, both they and theirs were made to serue him. If you, <hi>M.

But let it be eightie, seuentie, sixtie: let it be fiftie: or, if that séeme too much, let it be fortie.

<pb n="392" facs="tcp:15991:197"/>
censures, if the Courtisans, (who pay tribute for license to bee common whoores) &amp; other farmers of holy rents, kepe not touch in bringing in. And because these censures haue not preuailed alwayes to atchieue their purposes: therefore as they enlarged them against ciuill powers to purchase somewhat thence, (as from the king of <hi>England,</hi> beside his Peter-pence, a thousand markes yearely, which yet was but a pety-larceny:) so they strengthned them against ecclesiasticall by the <hi>othe</hi> of fealty (which they haue woon of Prelats,) <hi>to maintaine the Papacie and royalties of S.

But the head of all, whereby those wilde boares haue made the chiefest wast of the Lordes vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yarde, is the fifth and last point: their making and establishing of the Church-lawes. For if they had doon, and onely doon these vilanies: they might séeme to haue doon them, as men, not as Popes; and it might be hoped, when one tyrant were gone, the next would gouerne well. But they haue confirmed the dooing of them by their lawes, and procured those lawes to be receiued as canons &amp; rules of the Church-gouernment: their <hi>Decretals,</hi> their <hi>Clementines,</hi> their <hi>Extrauagants,</hi> in déed extrauagant, their <hi>constitutions Apostolike,</hi> and their vnruly <hi>rules of the Apostolike chauncerie.</hi> The grosse intent and practise where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is so palpable, that <hi>Budaeus,</hi> a learned lawier, the French kinges secretarie, making a complaint of the great disorder of the Popes, and clergie, doth lay the blame thereof vpon their lawes and iurisdiction. <note n="e" place="margin">

                           </note> I must loue you the better for your plaine dealing in so weightie a matter. That you doo not see how the Pope may be iustified, (I speake not of his naughtie and corrupt maners, but of his supreme and soueraine authoritie, which is, as I take it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Scripture, and Christes owne appointment:) it séemeth to me that your errour herein procéedeth of a wrong per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, that he had not that authoritie by right, but vsurped it. Which is not so: as I haue alreadie shewed in part, and now will proue vnto you farther. For it is so farre off from being v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped authoritie, that if we will weigh thinges but with indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie and in equall balance, you shall well perceiue that both Emperours, and other Princes adioyning vnto him, haue rather vsurped of his, then he of theirs. In so much that a <hi>good autour</hi> doth write that <hi>through the Popes negligent looking vnto
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:15991:199"/>
it, S. Peters patrimonie is greatly diminished.</hi> Yea, perhaps, it is much lesse now at this time, (how great or how lordly soeuer it seeme in your eye,) then it was in the very best times almost thirtéene hundred yeares since. For, to beginne with the dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, he, (as <hi>Eugubinus</hi> writeth) <hi>resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to S. Syluester Pope and to his successors the citie of Rome with all his Imperiall roabes, and ornaments,</hi> him selfe rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where he abode as in his Imperiall seate, as also many other Emperours after him for many yeares togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did, kéeping still either at <hi>Constantinople</hi> in the east, or els at <hi>Milan</hi> and <hi>Rauenna</hi> in the west. And this to be a certaine storie of the gift of <hi>Constantine</hi> to the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> besides very many witnesses which here I could cite for proofe therof, as <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> a heathen, who was sorie to sée it, <hi>Photius Constantinopolitanus,</hi> no fauourer of the Pope nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and a <hi>Grecian</hi> borne, <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> and many moe besides, as you may reade in the <hi>Chronicles: S. Damasus,</hi> who liued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the same time, and saw <hi>Constantine</hi> himselfe, doth write of the said donation and gift of the Emperour. Which gift more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, to put it out of all doubt, was confirmed a hundred yeares after by the Emperour <hi>Iustinian,</hi> by <hi>Arithpert</hi> king of the <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardes,</hi> by king <hi>Pipine</hi> of <hi>Fraunce, Charles</hi> the great, holy king <hi>Lewes,</hi> and lastly by <hi>Otho</hi> the great at a Councell holden at <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenna,</hi> as your owne men in their <hi>Centuries</hi> doo graunt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse. For although they say withall that <hi>this encrease of wealth in the Church of Rome began after S. Gregories time</hi>; yet are they notably disproued by <hi>S. Gregorie</hi> himselfe, in whose reigne, (as it may probably be thought,) the Churches possessions were more then they be now at this present. And this appee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by sundry of his epistles, where he maketh expresse mention of <hi>S. Peters patrimonie</hi> in <hi>Africke,</hi> in <hi>Naples,</hi> in <hi>Campania,</hi> in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> in <hi>Italie,</hi> in <hi>Sicilia,</hi> in <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and in many other countries. Now then whereas for this which is the gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atest part, so good proofes may be made: there is no doubt but for sundry other very great and large giftes of diuers Princes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nobles, men and women, which were bestowed vpon that Sée, the Bishops thereof can shew very good euidence when nede shall require.

               <p>I: least the Pope growing dayly mightier by reason of wealth, and bordering vpon him, should encroch on somewhat of his vpon occasion. As Princes now adayes are wont to

               <p>Embassadours or Agents perhaps they may haue in realmes or cities néere them.

               <p>Yea, and that directly: as by his wordes you shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue. <hi>S. Gregorie about the sixe hundreth yeare of Christ doth shew in his epistles that the Church had ample landes and possessions, farre and wide through the west. At the which time S. Isidore in his storie (as Nauclerus citeth in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuenth age of his Chronicles) Constantine, saith he, did yeelde the citie to the Pope, and the imperiall ornaments, that is to say, the crown,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:15991:207"/>
and the white palfrey on the which he rode. Altogither as Photius of Constantinople, though otherwise an enimie of the See of Rome, auoucheth in his Nomocanon about the yeare eight hundred and sixtie.</hi>

               <p>Nay: no more of <hi>Photius.</hi> For it is not he (as I haue shewed) who saith it, but <hi>Balsamon</hi> who commenteth on him. And <hi>Balsamon</hi> is later by thrée hundred yeares.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Hart.</speaker>
               <p>Yet he was a Grecian too, and an enimie of the Sée of <hi>Rome</hi>: and therefore not likely to vouch it, if it were not true.</p>

               <p>But <hi>Genebrard</hi> hath graunted that to be false which he voucheth.

               <p>You are the writer, <hi>M.

fallen to the Turke. But whatsoeuer right these reasons may afforde to the Pope now: they acquite him not from hauing doon wrong to the Emperours heretofore, in that he got his tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall dominion from them by treason and rebellion. And this is the first point, wherein you went about to cléere his suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. The next, is his tyrannie in spirituall things. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your defense of him is so tempered, that although you cannot choose but acknowledge his faute in those excesses which I laide open: yet doo you smooth them as abuses onely of lawfull autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and not vnlawfull actes of vsurped power. For you say, that <hi>if any of the Bishops of Rome abused their wealth to any euill purpose, or els their autoritie, in any of the pointes mentioned by me: you are so farre off from iustifying them therein, that rather you rew to see it, and you condemne them therefore.</hi> A short and sclender answere to all their crimes that I touched. Howbeit, if you speake vnfainedly, <hi>M.

In all the which pointes if you condemne their doinges as <hi>abuses of their autoritie</hi>: you condemne the practise of their whole supremacie as nothing els in grosse but an heape of <hi>abuses.</hi>

               <p>Not of their whole supremacie. For though some of them <hi>abused</hi> their autoritie in sundrie pointes which you mentioned: yet others haue not doon so. As we had experience in Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes: wherein there were not so many Church-liuings bestowed in <hi>England</hi> vpon <hi>Italian</hi> Pastors, as you spake of vnder <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ninth, or <hi>Innocentius</hi> the fourth. But howsoeuer they dealt with practise of their power, which they abused I graunt: the <hi>power</hi> it selfe must not be ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought vnlawfull; nor was it <hi>vsurped</hi> because it was <hi>abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</hi> For Princes abuse their power oftentimes in oppressing

               <p>Neither doo I say that the Pope <hi>vsurpeth</hi> his Bishoply power, but <hi>the supremacie.</hi> The <hi>vsurping</hi> whereof you go about to hide with the mist of <hi>abusing</hi>; while you distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish not betwéene a lawfull power vsed vnlawfully, and an vnlawfull power. King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth did put to death <hi>Burdet</hi> (a marchant of <hi>London</hi>) for saying merily to his sonne, that <hi>he would make him inheritour of the crowne:</hi> miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struing his wordes, as though he had meant <hi>the crowne</hi> of the realme; where he meant his house at the signe of <hi>the crowne.</hi> Herein the king abused his power, and not vsurped it: because God had giuen him the sworde to execute iustice and iudgement on his subiect; though he vsed it vnlawfully against an innocent.

But if he presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to excommunicate other kings, or to depose the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour: the power that he practised therein was vnlawfull, and he vsurped it. Which example of his dealing with the ciuill state, obserueth the tenour of the same disorder in the ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. For if he <note n="*" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22.</note> laide handes rashly vpon a man whom he had right to ordeine: his power was lawfull, though abused. But if he tooke vpon him the right of making Pastors, or of giuing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices and Bishoprickes through all the world: hee did vsurpe vnlawfull power. Wherefore sith the tyranny wherewith I charged him in spirituall things was of the supremacie ouer all Christendome, not of Bishoply power ouer his owne diocese: the power of spiritual rule which he practised ouer both the states ecclesiasticall and ciuill, is not abused, but vsurped. Neither can you salue it with laying the blame on <hi>some</hi> of the prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours: as if the successours now were guiltlesse of it. For, though they doo not all commit the same excesse in the execution

of their vsurped power: yet they all maintaine the libertie of dooing it, and doo it when they list. As since Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes one of your best Popes, <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth, hath shewed: <note n="b" place="margin">

                  </gap>hop, and knew to be a Bishop that helde the catholike faith; which praise by that title of <hi>the rocke</hi> he giueth him. In <hi>Afrike,</hi> they were troubled with other heretikes named <hi>Donatistes</hi>: a sect which despised the communion of Saintes, and rent them selues a sunder from the assemblies of Christians, because <hi>there were some euil men amongst them</hi> (as they said) <hi>whose felow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship defiled them. S. Austin</hi> wrote <hi>a Psalme</hi> for the Catholiks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these: wherein, hauing proued first out of the scriptures, that we must not leaue the communion of the Church for that there are some euill men in it, sith Christ hath declared that there should be so, as <hi>tares</hi> with <hi>corne, in the field</hi>; as <hi>chaffe</hi> with <hi>wheate in the floore</hi>; as <hi>badde</hi> with <hi>good, in the nett</hi>; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth this doctrine by the consent &amp; iudgement of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whose Bishops euen from <hi>Peter</hi> had imbraced it still, and constantly maintained it, the gates of hel in vaine assaulting them. So the wordes of <hi>Austin</hi> and <hi>Ierom</hi> doo import a since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of faith in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> &amp; the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops against the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Donatistes</hi>: but neither of their wordes import the supremacie, which is a soueraintie of power.</p>

               <p>An honest mans worde is as good as his oth. For as he will not forsweare: so neither lye. The <hi>Fathers</hi> must not therefore be the lesse beleeued, because they are not sworne.</p>

               <p>Good words, <hi>M. Hart.</hi> Your plaister, of <hi>media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of intercession and saluation,</hi> is too narrow for this soare. Your pang doth make you not to sée it.</p>

               <p>Nay: no whit to narrow. For the <hi>mediation</hi> which we giue to <hi>Saintes,</hi> is so farre inferiour to the diuine and singular <hi>mediation</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> that whereas we say to them, <hi>Pray for vs,</hi> we say not so to him, we doo not thinke of him so basely, but wée desire him <hi>to haue mercy vpon vs.</hi> Wherefore, we make him onely <hi>mediatour of saluation</hi>; and them, <hi>of intercession.</hi>

               <p>As when a Greeke writer is translated into Latin, the translator maketh him sometimes to say that which he neuer meant. And before printing, the scriueners, who co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied out bookes with hand, committed sundrie scapes. Which
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:15991:250"/>
likewise befalleth vnto printers now. So there may be a faute in an autour without the autours faute, through ouersight of printers, or scriueners, or translators. For example, in the story ecclesiasticall of <note n="i" place="margin">

               <p>No: but their <hi>epistles</hi> are like to that booke in sundrie respectes. It is ancient: it was printed aboue a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares ago. And he, who set it foorth, saith that <hi>Ouid wrote it in his old age, and willed it to be laide vp in his graue with him: in the which graue it was found at length by the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the countrey who sent it to Constantinople, and the Emperour gaue it to Leo his principal notarie, who did publish it.</hi> A smooth tale, to make men beleeue that it is <hi>Ouids.</hi> Of whom though it sauour no more, then these <hi>epistles</hi> of the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi>: yet if your <hi>Diuines</hi> could finde some antike verse there that were an euidence for the Popes supremacie, I sée my former reasons would not disswade you from beléeuing but <hi>Ouid</hi> wrote the booke. For, to the barbarousnes and base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>style,</hi> if I should vrge it, you might answere that <hi>Ouid</hi> wrote so for two causes: that he might not séeme to be vaine gloriously giuen, and that his repentance might bee knowne euen to the simplest. To the silence of <hi>witnesses,</hi> that no man maketh mention of it amongst his workes, you might answere that it lay hidden in his graue. And this you might answere with greater shew of likelyhood, then that the Popes <hi>epistles</hi> lay hidden in the Popes librarie.

               <p>I: but <hi>Turrian</hi> saith that when these epistles were first set abroad to the vse of the Church that they might come to all mens knowlege, then was it thought good (because <hi>S.

               <p>Because sundrie sentences, which in them are cited out of the Prophets, would better fit the purpose if they had béene cited according to the other which was out of the Gréeke, then according to <hi>S.

               <p>Whether it doo, or no: it is plaine that the autour meant not so to cite it.

               <p>You still suspect the worst. It might be the <hi>correctors</hi> faute and not the <hi>Censours.</hi> Or if the <hi>Censour</hi> did it, he did it of a good minde, because he thought that <hi>Contius</hi> was deceiued in it.</p>

the rest too, if he had béene the dooer: as it is of the <hi>Censour,</hi> who suffering not the <hi>preface</hi> to passe to the print for the Popes sake, may iustly be suspected that he would straine an ynch farther to helpe the Pope. But, you say, <hi>he did it of a good minde.</hi> But good mindes must learne to vse good meanes also. At least, he should haue doon as Frier <hi>Surius</hi> did: who, whereas in the olde edition of the Councels there were certaine thinges noted out of <hi>Cassiodore, Marianus Scotus,</hi> and <hi>Gregorie Haloander,</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the yeares of the <hi>Consuls</hi> who are named in the dates of those <hi>epistles</hi> of the Popes: <hi>Surius</hi> (in his new edition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) hath left out all those notes, <note n="o" place="margin">

                  <hi>as appeereth by Marianus Scotus &amp; others, yea, euen by the notes added to those epistles in the Tome of Councels.</hi> Which wordes might worke discredit to the <hi>Centurie-writers</hi> with them who sée the Councels in no edition but the last: for there are no such <hi>notes.</hi> And <hi>Surius,</hi> in leauing them out, hath answered well that reason of the <hi>Centurie-writers.</hi> Though he should haue answered it a greate deale better, if he had left out also the <hi>epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> them selues. For as long as they are extant: we shall not néede the <hi>notes</hi> vpon their dates to control them. Yet as he dealt wisely in leauing out the <hi>notes,</hi> so he shewed honestie in telling men of it: that they may know there were <hi>notes</hi> before, which impaired the credit of the <hi>epistles</hi>; and if they list to sée them, they may seeke and finde them too. But <hi>the Censour,</hi> who fell vpon the <hi>notes</hi> of <hi>Contius,</hi> hath shewed no such honestie. For neither hath he giuen any signification that he caused <hi>the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> to be left out; neither hath hee tolde vs of an other edition where it might be found; and, that which is the worst, he hath made <hi>Contius</hi> to speake in maintenance of that which him selfe
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:15991:262"/>
knew and had declared to be forged. All the which pointes it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooueth the iury to consider off; and not to weigh only the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Contius,</hi> or <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> or <hi>Cusanus,</hi> for the disproofe of those counterfeits on which you ground the Popes supremacie: but to thinke with them selues how many more of likelihood euen in the middest of Poperie haue spoken against them; yea, sundry peraduenture, who, (as their writings are printed now,) speake for them. For if in these dayes when men doo sift their dooings, <hi>Surius</hi> durst aduenture to leaue out <hi>notes</hi> already printed, and <hi>the Censour</hi> to suppresse things in printers hands that they may neuer come to light, yea, to write <hi>notes</hi> in the names of autours flat contrarie to their iudgement, &amp; print them as their own too: what is it to be feared they did in former times, when there were few that would espie them?

               <p>Your speech is absurd, and doth confute it selfe, in séeking to confute the Pope. For if he had but <hi>a diocese,</hi> how was he an <hi>Archbishop</hi>?

And so the first reason is gone. The second foloweth: which is no sounder then the former.

               <p>Why? Because the text of the Prophet <hi>Malachie</hi> saith that <hi>there is offered a cleane oblation,</hi> or <hi>offering,</hi> as you call it. And <hi>offering</hi> is spoken of one, not of many. For els he should haue saide, <hi>offerings,</hi> not <hi>offering.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Masse</hi>? No. He meant <hi>the hostes and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> of the old law. For they are the wordes of the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> spoken of the legall and carnall sacrifices of the Iewes.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Iewes?</hi> Nay: the text of the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> saith that <hi>God mislyked host and oblation</hi>; it saith not, <hi>hostes and oblations.</hi> Wherefore sith he speaketh of one, not of many; and the carnall sacrifices of the Iewes were many, but the sacrifice of the Masse is one, as you say: it séemeth he should meane that.

               <p>Our adoration of the <hi>host</hi> is good, in spite of all here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, and not reproued by the Prophet.

               <p>They are not like to <hi>D. Allens.</hi> But the fifth reason doth put the matter out of doubt. For, (in the iudgement chiefly of heretikes,) <note n="1" place="margin">

For here in our testament, they can not choose all the best to them selues, and offer to the Lord for sacrifice the féeble, the lame, and the sicke, as before in the old: because there is now one sacrifice so appointed, that it can not be changed; so cleane, that no worke of ours can distaine it.</p>

               <p>And thinke you <hi>M. Hart,</hi> that <hi>the workes of Christians</hi> can not be the <hi>offering</hi> which the Prophet speaketh
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:15991:301" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of, because <hi>they are defiled, howsoeuer they seeme bewtifull</hi>? Thinke you thus in déede? Then you consent yet in the chiefest point of Christian religion (which God graunt you doo) with <hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes,</hi> as you terme vs. For, if <hi>our workes be defiled, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they seeme bewtifull, chiefly as heretikes iudge</hi>: then are men iustified by faith, not by workes. If <hi>our workes bee defiled, howsoeuer they seeme bewtifull:</hi> then fulfill we not the law of God perfitly, much lesse super-erogate. If <hi>our works be defiled, howsoeuer they seeme bewtifull</hi>: then are they me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious of euerlasting death, but euerlasting life it is impossible they should merit.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Hart.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, I meant not so. For though they be <hi>defiled,</hi> as they are of our selues: yet as they are of Christ, whose grace wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in vs, they are pure and perfit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Rainoldes.</speaker>
               <p>Then, as <hi>they are wrought by the grace of Christ,</hi> so they may be the <hi>offering</hi> which the Prophet speaketh of. For they are <hi>pure and perfit</hi> so, and therefore <hi>cleane</hi> by your owne opinion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hart.</speaker>
               <p>But the Propheticall <hi>offering</hi> is <hi>cleane of it selfe.</hi> Our workes are not cleane of them selues, but of Christ: and therefore can not be that <hi>offering.</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>of it selfe,</hi>] to make his reason serue: the Prophet saith no more but that <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.11.</note> the <hi>offering</hi> is <hi>cleane.</hi> Wherefore sith our workes are cleane and vndefiled; chiefly as Papistes iudge: our workes might be meant by the Propheticall <hi>offering,</hi> howsoeuer they be vnperfit and impure of them selues.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hart.</speaker>
               <p>What? And doo you thinke, <hi>M. Rainoldes,</hi> that <hi>our workes,</hi> though <hi>vncleane of them selues,</hi> yet <hi>as they are wrought by the grace of Christ,</hi> are <hi>cleane and vndefiled</hi>?

               <p>If you bring such witnesses to proue the Popes supremacie: I must request the iury to haue an eye to the issue.

               <p>The case is not like. For it was the personal wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, vertue, lerning, or faith of these men, which made them to be sought to. But that, which made the Fathers séeke to the Popes, was the prerogatiue of their office:</p>

Wherefore the <hi>scripture</hi> doth not onely teach the <hi>Church,</hi> but also amply and plentifully teach it, all things behoofull to saluation. For although the substance of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith be single and the same, wherewith as with meate the seruants of God are fedde to life eternall: yet, as the ages of the seruants differ, and in ages different their cases differ too; so was it méete there should be sundry sortes and waies to diuide that meate, and as it were to season it, for ech one his part as it might best agrée with him. Whereof that we might haue a true &amp; liuely paterne set foorth by Christs owne spirit in the word of life for the féeding of the faithfull: therefore hée gaue sundry woorke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (so to terme them) and writers of his faith, that although they deliuered all the same foode, yet they did not dresse it all in one sort. And so it cometh to passe, that, in those writers of the faith of Christ, both the vnitie of doctrine in the diuersitie of deliuering yeldeth a swéete tast in the spirituall mouth of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minde; and the manifold vse ministreth holesome nourishment to euery mans stomake; &amp; the euident plainnesse in the groundes of faith maketh that euen they who are of deintiest mouthes can not refuse it for the toughnes; and the hidden wisedome in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes of scripture both trieth the strongest, and satisfieth them
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:15991:351"/>
who are sharpest set; and (to say that in a word which no wordes can expresse enough) the infinite treasures bring infinite fruits to the faithfull, to procure them a blessednes that is exceeding great and infinite. Wherefore it is a thing so cléere, and so sure, that those secretaries of the holy Ghost (ioyned togither) doo open to the Church in the holy scriptures all things behoofefull to saluation: that he, who knoweth it not, may be iustly counted ignorant; hée who acknowledgeth it not, lewde; hée who dissembleth it, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull; hée who denieth it, more then wicked.

But let vs (right woorshipfull) who know that the <hi>dials</hi> and <hi>clockes</hi> doo mysse often, but the course of the <hi>sunne</hi> is certaine and constant, let vs make more account of the <hi>sunne,</hi> then of a <hi>diall</hi>; of heauen, then of <hi>Plinie</hi>; of the <hi>Zodiake</hi> circle, then of the field of <hi>Flora</hi>; of God, then of men; of <hi>Christ,</hi> then of <hi>Pighius</hi>; of the <hi>holy scripture,</hi> then of the <hi>church.</hi> For God forbid there should be any (amongst vs) so beastly a monster in the shape of man, as to set vp Antichrist in the temple of God aboue God: and to attribute more to any, either man, or multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of men, then to the Lord of maiestie. But so doo they, no dout, who haue the <hi>Church</hi> in greater regard then the <hi>scripture.</hi> For the voice of the <hi>scripture</hi> is the voice of God: the voice of the <hi>Church</hi> is the voice of men. Then if it be impious to set vp men aboue God: doubtlesse, to set vp the <hi>Church</hi> aboue the <hi>scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> it is Antichristian.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vnto many, that through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and consolation of the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture the church might reape some fruite of them. Howbeit as <hi>Apelles</hi> was wont to set forth his pictures at his stall, that, if any fault were found, he might amend it, before they were deliuered to such as they were drawen for: the like haue I done with mine, (though not like his,) by keping the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin at home as it were, that, if any thing were iustly blamed in them, it might be corrected, before I sent them abroad to English men. In the which respect, though I could hardly resist the importunate desire of sundry frendes, of whom some had translated them, requesting that I would translate them my selfe or suffer theirs to be printed: yet I resisted it, &amp; hope they tooke it in good part. But now being otherwise enforced to publish my conference with <hi>M. Hart</hi>: I haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

So that, seeing he brake off conference thereon, and would not put the faith of his church to that triall, to which he had put the Pope, the head of it: the godly, who will wish that also had bene handled to the confusion of all Poperie, may for want of larger repast take this sclende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
