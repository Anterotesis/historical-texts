            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>COuld either
my desires, or
endeavours have
prevailed for the
suppressing of the
following <hi>Letter,</hi>
it had been buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the same
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64860:3"/>
Grave with her to
whom it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress'd.
But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fallen into the
Hands of her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
after her
Death, many <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies</hi>
were disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
before my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into <hi>England,</hi>
and thereby a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
put upon
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64860:3"/>
me either to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
it my self, or
to have the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfaction
of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
others do it,
for me.</p>
            <p>This being the
true account of
the <hi>Edition</hi> of this
short Treatise, I
shall need the less
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64860:4"/>
Apology, if there
seem nothing in it
for which it should
be exposed to a
publick view. It
was writ as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Letter, to a
person of more
Piety, than Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity;
and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any prospect;
nay I may add
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64860:4"/>
more, upon an
assurance that it
should never come
to any ones sight
but her own. And
therefore it ought
not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
if it appear
with all the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and freedom,
which an <hi>Episto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary</hi>
Stile and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64860:5"/>
required.
For the rest, as I
can sincerely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that it was no
principle of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that led me
first to write it,
so much less does
any such Motive
induce me now to
publish it. It was
to serve a greater
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64860:5"/>
and better end, I
both then did, and
now do design it:
And if those who
shall hereafter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use
it, do it but
with the same pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
that she did
for whom it was
composed, I am
perswaded neither
they nor I shall
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64860:6"/>
have any cause
to repent us of
our Labour.</p>

               </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE <hi>Address</hi> I
here make you,
how meanly so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I have performed it;
is yet so suitable to your
circumstances, and so
well befits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my character;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64860:7"/>
that I make no doubt
but you will accept it
with the same charity
that I have designed it.
And therefore instead of
making <hi>Apologies</hi> for
my undertaking, I will
rather send it to you with
my hearty Prayers, that
those few directions I have
here put together, may
be as truly useful to you,
as I do assure you they
were really by me inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for your service.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:64860:7"/>
You are not, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
to expect in this
short draught any thing
but what you have often
already heard, and, I
perswade my self, have
long practised. <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
is none of those
things that <hi>change
with the Fashion,</hi>
and accommodate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the <hi>mode:</hi>
And though we have of
late met with some who
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64860:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have endeavoured upon
the foundations of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi>
to erect a new
Scheme of <hi>Court-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,</hi>
by making the
way to Heaven both
broader and smoother
than it is: yet both the
projectors and those that
follow them will sadly
find themselves mistaken
in the end; when the one
shall perish for betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Master, and
the others be condemn'd
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64860:8"/>
for not rejecting their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Madam,</hi> if
you find nothing new in
the <hi>matter,</hi> I am sure
much less will you have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing in the <hi>Stile</hi> and
<hi>Method,</hi> but what is
plain and easie. In such
discourses as these, he
seems to me to speak
most properly, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
himself most clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Some things indeed I
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64860:9"/>
should have added; others
have changed, and have
dress'd the whole with
greater care; but I had
little time, and much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
business, which I
am sure you know to be
more than <hi>pretence.</hi>
The rules yet I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
are sound and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and may as they are,
serve your devotion;
But if your abundance
of better helps frustrate
that design, yet at least
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64860:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you will be pleased to
esteem it an undoubted
testimony of that sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with which I am,</p>
            <closer>
               <salute>Madam,</salute>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THERE is nothing
hath proved more
fatal to that due <hi>Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
we ought to make
for <hi>another life,</hi> than our
unhappy mistake of the
nature of <hi>this.</hi> We are
brought into the World,
Children, Ignorant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
Impotent; we grow up
in vanity and folly; and
when we come to be
Men, we are but very
little more prudent and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64860:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
more considerate. The
whole of our <hi>Reflections</hi>
terminates in this, what
course we are to take
to pass our time; some
to get, others to spend
their Estates; and when
Interest or Inclination,
Friends or Fortune have
determined the choice,
we are then entred in,
and our remaining busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is to pursue this end
to the best advantage,
for our present ease and
our future establishment.
Thus are our thoughts
and our desires wholly
tied to this World; we
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64860:11"/>
vainly project a settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in it, nor look we
any farther than the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Interests and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
thereof engage
us.</p>
            <p>2. I AM sure, <hi>Madam,</hi>
I need not say much to
convince you, who have
had so many opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to settle this <hi>Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
upon your own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
and who, I am
perswaded, have so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably
employ'd them,
that this is the just cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of the far greater
part of Mankind: And
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64860:11"/>
for the unhappy influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of it to the <hi>Decay</hi> of
<hi>Christianity,</hi> I think it is
not to be doubted that 'tis
the tying of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
so much to this
World, that above any
thing indisposes us to
think of another. Whilest
we set up our Hopes and
our Establishment here,
we either altogether for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get,
or at least do not
so vigorously consider,
That God has provided
another and better place
for us, whither we shall
in a very little time be
transferred by him, and

               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:64860:13"/>
for which therefore the
great affair of our whole
lives now should be to
provide.</p>
            <p>3. IS IT possible to
be imagined that we
should see such num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
engage their lives
and Labours, some to
heap together <hi>A little
dirt</hi> that shall bury them
in the end; Others to
gain an <hi>Honour,</hi> that at
best can be celebrated
but by an inconsiderable
part of the World, and is
envied and calumniated
by more than 'tis truly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64860:13"/>
given; Most to pursue
the pleasures (as they
call them) of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
which begin in
sin, are carried on with
Danger, and end in bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness;
and scarce one
that troubles himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Blessings of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
or at least lives as if
he did so; would Men
seriously perswade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
that they have here
<hi>no abiding place, no City
to dwell in:</hi> but are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in their passage to
the heavenly <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
their <hi>City which is above,</hi>
where alone true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64860:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is to be found, and
upon which therefore
their thoughts and their
endeavours ought chiefly
to be employed.</p>
            <p>4. CAN we behold the
vices and debaucheries of
many; the carelessness
and irreligion of almost
all; and believe that the
<hi>Christian World</hi> is seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
convinced of those
great truths their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
teaches them of A <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
life,</hi> and <hi>A vast Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
of rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,
according as
we observe or neglect the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64860:14"/>
Duties it commands in
<hi>This?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. How shall we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that those Men are
perswaded of the true
business of this Life, that
'tis the time of tryal, that
God has thrown us into
this World as into A Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
to exercise our selves
in it, and receive the
<hi>Crown</hi> if we come off with
Victory, who so shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
decline the <hi>Combat;</hi>
and are so far from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the victory, that
we are scarcely to be
brought but even to do
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64860:15"/>
any thing towards it.</p>
            <p>6. IN a word; were
it possible that the
thoughts of <hi>Eternity,</hi> but
especially the near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
of it, by a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
age, a crasy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
or a violent
sickness, should amaze
so many as we find it
does, make them so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to go to Christ,
and receive the <hi>Reward
of their Labours;</hi> had
they ever truly conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
all these things; and
not rather with old <hi>Sime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
sing their <hi>Nunc dimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:64860:15"/>
with comfort and

to deal with any
other than your self, these
and the like considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
would engage me,
before I entred on the
following prescriptions,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64860:16"/>
to dispose your mind to
a reception of them, by
shewing you the great
interest we have in <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi>
That our Lives are
uncertain, to be sure can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be long here, and
that therefore we ought
to hasten all we can, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it be too late, to
examine our Souls, and
provide for futurity.
That all the little Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
we now pursue, for
which our ease, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
nay our very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
it self is sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
by us, are but vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and trifles, neither
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64860:16"/>
worthy in themselves,
nor satisfying in their
enjoyment; But, <hi>Madam,</hi>
your vertue, and your
prudence, make all such
preparations unnecessary
formalities, and instead
of opening the way to the
following <hi>Address</hi> by
such insinuations, I ought
rather to apologize for my
indiscretion in the whole
undertaking, which your
piety prevents, and which
your dayly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> practice
shews you already to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
beyond any
thing I am able to offer
for your assistance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:64860:17"/>
8. NEVERTHELESS
since it has pleased God
to an excellent natural
disposition to add yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Obligations, and by
the troubles of this Life
to draw you to himself;
to shew you worthy of
his favour, and I trust
more highly to reward
you in the next; be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to give me leave
this way to congratulate
with you those Evils,
which so many are wont
to lament, and which
no one more sincerely
wishes (if it please God)
to see you free from,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64860:17"/>
than my self; and as you
have done me the honour
to command my atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
whilst you were
with us here, pardon
me if I intrude upon
your meditations a few
of my most serious <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,</hi>
to supply my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;
and be a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of that real respect
wherewith I honour
you now in your retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

yet is it really some satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64860:18"/>
to me, that I am
not now wholly liable to
that Censure, which is
so usually made on these

any Man when he is well to

God, for the rashness per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps

to speak at all. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

Mercy in the Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and if it please him
altogether to silence me,
so, That I shall not only,

will give me grace even
in my <hi>thoughts</hi> to praise
him; To consider the
justice of his proceeding
with me, and to implore
his pardon of what my

            <p>2. IT cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
but that this is an
exercise of the most diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
Nature, and the

considerations there are

            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:64860:20"/>
3. AND the first of
these both in our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
and this Discourse
ought to be, <hi>To look up
to that Hand that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts
them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is our great unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
when any calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
fall upon us, that we
are uneasie and dissatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and our whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
and project is,
how to remove them,
not to consider from
whence they come.
Sometimes indeed, if the
cause be visible, we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64860:20"/>
of it as of a <hi>chance</hi>
or a <hi>misfortune,</hi> but we
stop at the instrument,
and never pass on to
him that directed it;
the second cause we
know, but trouble our
selves no further to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
to the first: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
would we seriously
consider, * that the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God orders
all the affairs of the World;</hi>
* that <hi>without his assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
we can no more get
quit of our Affliction,
than but by his permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
we first fell into it;</hi>
* that <hi>this unquietness
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64860:21"/>
therefore is a murmuring
against his justice, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
against his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
upon whom alone
we ought to rely;</hi> and
<hi>whose mercy we should by
all imaginable submission
implore;</hi> We should then
acquiesce in his dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
till it pleased his
goodness to remove our
evils; cry out with old
<hi>Eli,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 3. 18.</note> 
               <hi>It is the
Lord, let him
do what seemeth him good:</hi>
and as we dayly pray
that <hi>his will may be done in
Earth,</hi> so by our submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
shew that we truly
desire it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:64860:21"/>
4. <hi>LET us to this add,</hi>
Secondly; <hi>That</hi> God
delights not to afflict,
nor ever willingly
grieves the Children of
Men.</p>
            <p>* IT may be we suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in our calamity the
punishment of our sins,
and then let us not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
at that which is the
just reward of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servings.
* Perhaps God
proves us in this life, that
he may the more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously
reward us in the
next; and how then
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64860:22"/>
shall we repine against
his mercy, which makes
these <hi>light af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
that are
but for a moment,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 17.</note> 
               <hi>work out
for us a far more exceeding
and eternal weight of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
To be sure if we
make that use of them
which he intends, if we
repent seriously, submit
contentedly, and serve
him faithfully, they shall
turn to our advantage:
tho' the passage be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome,
yet is it secure,
and shall in a little time
bring us ease and quiet,
and peace at the last.</p>

5. FOR let us not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the goodness of God,
nor imagine that because
he smites us, therefore we
are forsaken by him, but
let us consider rather,</p>

               <hi>Thirdly;</hi> 
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>That 'tis the
very Condition of all his
promises, through much
Tribulation to bring us
to his Kingdom;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That blessed place
where all evils shall be
removed,</hi>

                  <hi>and</hi> there

sorrow, nor crying, nor
pain.</p>
            </q>
            <p> 
               <hi>We have a full
account of this, Heb. 12.
A place so satisfactory,
that I will transcribe only
one passage, to engage
you to recur your self to
the rest;</hi> My son despise
not thou the
chastning of
the Lord,<note place="margin">v. 5. 6.</note> nor faint when
thou art rebuked of him;
for whom the Lord loveth
he chastneth, and scourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
every son whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth.
<hi>But,</hi> Fourthly;</p>
            <p>6. <q>Let us look into the Ages
that have gone before
us;</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:64860:23"/>
LET us consult our
own experience in the
present; we shall find
the observation of our
<hi>Apostle</hi> ever to have been
verified, that the best
men generally fall under
the severest pressures,
Our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> was
our forerunner in this
trial, as well as in the
reward that accompanies
it: He began as we
ought to follow after,
and <hi>for the joy which was
set before him
endured the
cross,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 2.</note> 
               <hi>despising the shame.</hi>
Which of his holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64860:24"/>
escaped this trial;
What numbers of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Saints were under
the perpetual persecution
of the most malicious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
that Hell could raise
against them, for many
hundred Years. <q>
                  <hi>They
were stoned, they were
sawn as under, were slain
with the sword,
they wandred
up and down in sheeps skins
and Goats skins,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute,
afflicted, tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
and yet were these
the Men, <hi>of
whom the world
was not worthy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">—38.</note> whom
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64860:24"/>
we ought with comfort
to look up unto, <hi>and
run with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
the race
that is set before us.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 1.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>7. THESE considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
though I have (as
I ought) proposed in
general terms, yet I am
sure, <hi>Madam,</hi> you will not
fail by a particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to bring them
home to your own
concerns; and for your
easier performance I will
go on if you please to
make yet a reflection or
two that may fortifie you
in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:64860:25"/>
8. IN enquiring into
the goods that you have
lost, or the evils, you ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fear or suffer; I
shall not trouble you
with an Enumeration of
that which I know you
despise, the <hi>flatteries,</hi> the
<hi>courtship,</hi> the other <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities</hi>
of the World;
The very loss of these
is a happiness almost e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to what you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
for it. And though
that Beauty, which yet
others, I perswade my
self, valued too more
highly than your self,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64860:25"/>
was a Blessing which
you owed much to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for; yet the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
ornaments you
have hereby the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of making to
your Soul, will in the
end give you a more solid
satisfaction, and as much
chain to you the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the good and
wise, as the other at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
the eyes of the
rest.</p>
            <p>9. FOR your present
distemper; it is, God be
thanked, neither so trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
for the present,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64860:26"/>
as to take you off from all
satisfaction; nor, I am
willing to perswade my
self, shall it prove so
dangerous in its conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
as to deprive
you of all hope of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your self again in
your former health, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
disciplined and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
not utterly cut
off by sickness.</p>
            <p>10. HOWEVER, let
us suppose now, as well
as fear the worst; Is
there any thing parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
in dying young?
Do not thousands every
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64860:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
day do it? And have
you known none in
health and vigour, who
have pitied your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and behold they
are themselves gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you, even since
you fell into this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper:
And what is
the harm then of this?
that you have fairer
warning than others,
who are unexpectedly
cut off, and so have a
better opportunity, as
well as greater engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to cultivate your
Soul, and provide for
your latter end? To
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64860:27"/>
dye is no pain, to leave
this World is only to
get quit of a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
place, where you
could never find any
ease or quiet, any solid
satisfaction and comfort.
To go to Heaven is to
be transferr'd to that
Kingdom you have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
long'd for; to enjoy
all the glories of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
to become compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
for Saints and Angels,
and behold the Blessed
presence of God, <hi>in
whose presence there is
fulness of joy, and at
whose right hand there
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64860:27"/>
are pleasures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11. THE truth is,
the greatest part of your
misfortune is founded
on the opinion of the
World: we fools esteem
these things evils, and
this makes others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
they really are so.
But the good Christian
who considers them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as necessary passages
to <hi>a glorious immortality;</hi>
that through this dark
<hi>scene</hi> of fansied horror
sees a <hi>Crown</hi> and a <hi>Throne,</hi>
and <hi>everlasting blessings</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:64860:28"/>
prepared for him; joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
receives his Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
as he has long
impatiently expected it:
goes off out of the
World as contentedly
as the <hi>Actor</hi> when the
Play is ended leaves the
<hi>Stage.</hi> His only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
is, whilst he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
upon it, so to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean
himself, that he
may have a <hi>Plaudite</hi> at
last; and then 'tis all
one whether his part
ended in the <hi>Third Act,</hi>
or continues on to the
very last <hi>Scene.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:64860:28"/>
12. SUCH, <hi>Madam,</hi> are
your Obligations to this
first Duty, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of them will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
engage you to
these three things;</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Never despair ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Gods blessings here,
or of his reward hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi>
but go on as you
have begun; fulfil your
duty as he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded;
embrace his
promises with Faith and
assurance; and for the
rest, leave it in his hands;
as in the hands of a most
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64860:29"/>
merciful Saviour, who
himself became Man,
and suffer'd Death upon
the Cross for our sakes,
and by that stupendious
act of Mercy, has taught
us ever to rely in all
things upon his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Murmur not at your
sickness,</hi> for thereby you
will sin against God's
Providence and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
but submit
with peace to what you
suffer, and pray for
your deliverance. I do
not say you should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64860:29"/>
a rude insensibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
Sighs and Groans
and mournful expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
this is the sick
Mans proper language;
David <hi>roared for
the disquietness of
his soul;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ps. 38. 8.</note> our blessed
Lord himself in his last
and sharpest pang of
sorrow, <hi>cryed out
with a loud voice,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matthew xxvii 46.</note>
before <hi>he gave up
the ghost.</hi> There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in this but what
is innocent; and though
too much of it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
your weakness, yet
whilst you keep still a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64860:30"/>
resignation to God's dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal,
it cannot be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to you for any
sin.</p>
            <p>3. TAKE heed of
that, which is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
fault of sick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and which a long
disorder almost unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
brings with it,
and that is <hi>Peevishness.</hi>
This will but render
you uneasie to your self,
and to those about you;
it troubles your repose,
without doing you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
good; and is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be avoided both
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64860:30"/>
for the folly, and for the
sin.</p>
            <p>13. I SHALL close this
reflection with one neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
remark, which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
you to apply to all
the following; That in
speaking thus to you,
I am so far from charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you as guilty in
this matter, that I can
sincerely say, I believe
the exhortation wholly
needless, only it was
my duty in so impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
a concern to omit
nothing that might any
way be thought neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64860:31"/>
and it will be
your satisfaction to see
how far you are advanced
in your duty; and your
engagement to pursue
that very little, which
you may perhaps find
to be still wanting.</p>

think of, how much
more to enter into? But
for him who has lived
well, and who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
relies on God's
mercies for an <hi>eternal
Salvation,</hi> to shew this
concern, it betrays ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
much weakness or
great doubt, and either
his faith, or his hopes,
or both, are less firm
than they ought to
be,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64860:32"/>
               <q>HE therefore that
will not <hi>fear to dye,</hi>
must <hi>first</hi> be careful
<hi>to live well.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>2. THE stroak of death
is nothing; Children en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
it, and the greatest
Cowards find it no pain:
But when to this we
shall add the certain ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of its being
the gate to an <hi>eternal
life,</hi> then may we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to say, we have
wholly conquer'd this
<hi>King of terrours,</hi> and
sing the <hi>Epinikion</hi> of St.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64860:33"/>
Paul, 1 Cor. 15. <hi>O death
where is thy sting!</hi>
               <note place="margin">—v. 55.</note>
               <hi>O grave where
is thy victory!</hi>
               <note place="margin">—v. 57.</note>
               <hi>Thanks be to God who gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth

            </p>
            <p>Secondly; <hi>He must</hi> take
off his Affections from
this world.</p>
            <p>3. IT was the reflection
of the Son of <hi>Sirach
Ecclus 4. 1. O death, how
bitter is the remembrance
of thee to a Man that
liveth at rest in his possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to the Man that hath
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64860:33"/>
nothing to vex him, but
hath prosperity in all
things.</hi> Whilst we please
our selves with the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
we enjoy here, we
cannot expect but that it
must needs be a trouble
to us to be divorced from
them: But let us only
change the <hi>scene;</hi> instead
of these earthly, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient
goods; let us raise
our Souls to the Heavenly
and Eternal: then shall
we begin to think the
time long, that we are
divorced from them, and
wish for that end, we
before feared. <hi>Tully</hi> tells
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64860:34"/>
us that <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> was
so taken with this spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
that having on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
read in <hi>Plato</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures
of that great
Man concerning the <hi>state</hi>
of the <hi>Soul after death,</hi>
he had not patience to
tarry the tedious course
of nature, but by a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
death cut the thread
himself, that he might
immediately enjoy what
he so infinitely desired.</p>
            <p>4. NOR may we forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
our selves much less a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the fear of
death, <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:64860:34"/>
               <q>From the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>those evils it
frees us from,</hi> than of
that happiness it
transfers us to.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When the Great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
of <hi>Persia</hi> wept over
his Army upon this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
that within
the revolution of a single
Age, not a Man of all
that innumerable conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
would be left alive;
<hi>Artabanus</hi> standing by,
improved his meditation;
by adding, that yet all
of them should meet
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64860:35"/>
with so many and great
evils, that every one
should wish himself
dead long before that. It
is the true character of
our lives which
<hi>Job</hi> once gave.<note place="margin">Job 14. 1.</note>
               <hi>Man that is born of a
Woman hath but a short
time to live, and is full
of trouble.</hi> It is the
great blessing of Heaven
that as our lives are very
miserable, so are they ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
short too, and what
we usually complain of
as our misfortune, we
ought rather to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate
as our happiness.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64860:35"/>
Had <hi>David</hi> died a little
sooner, How much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
had he escaped which
now he endured, in the
rebellion and death of his
own Son, and all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
of a Civil War that
was raised against him.
Let any Man consult his
own experience, and say,
how many sorrows he
had miss'd, had God called
him to his rest but a few
years before; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whether the promise
he has made to <hi>deliver the
just from the evils to come,</hi>
ought not to be made our
dayly prayer for its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64860:36"/>
rather
than fill our Souls with
terror at the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> fourthly: <q>Death
do's not only free us
from misery, but sin
too.</q>
            </p>
            <p>5. THE life of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
is a continual war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
full of dangerous
conflicts and doubtful
consequences: Our lusts
sollicit us, the World
encourages, the Devil
tempts us; we fall often,
and are never secure.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64860:36"/>
But <hi>Death</hi> frees us from
all danger, sets us safely
on Shore in our long-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<hi>Canaan,</hi> where
there are no temptations,
no dangers, no possibility
of falling; but eternal
purity, and immortal joys
secure our happiness for
evermore.</p>
            <p>6. THERE is yet an
advice which may use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
be added here, and
it is this,</p>
            <p>
               <q>That since the time of
our dying is uncertain,
we should every day ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64860:37"/>
what every hour
may bring to us:</q>
            </p>
            <p>IT is our great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happiness
in this matter
that though we live ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so many years, we
are still surprized. We
<hi>put the evil day far
from us,</hi> and then it
catches us at unawares,
and we tremble at the
prospect. But let us
stand on our guard, let
us live like those who
expect to dye, and then
we shall find these ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
very much lessen,
and that we fear'd
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64860:37"/>
Death only because we
were unacquainted with
it. <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi>
had a Page con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
attending in his
Chamber to tell him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
morning as soon
as he awaked, <q>
                  <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
O King, that thou
art mortal.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>7. BUT to quit you
wholly of this fear, and
that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I may close this
point too with something
particular, give me leave,
<hi>Madam,</hi> to desire you,
instead of a thousand
arguments, to recur only
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64860:38"/>
to your own experience;
you have already lookt
death in the face, you
are acquainted with it,
what have you found so
terrible in it as to disturb
the repose of a good
Christian, <hi>i.e.</hi> of such
a one as your self. I
cannot without satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
remember the
calm, the quiet, the
peace you were then in;
when every hour seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to tell you 'twas
your last. <hi>Death</hi> is an
enemy you have already
met, and already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd;
you have pull'd
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64860:38"/>
out his sting, by the
preparation you have
made for it, and you
know he has nothing
now remaining that can
injure or affright you.
Only maintain your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
by securing your
innocence; and working
out your Salvation, and
then you may with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
undervalue that
which so much terrifies
the world, and which
yet all, even those who
the most dread it, must
in a little time meet
whether they will or
no.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. That you ought to be
careful to provide
for another World.</head>
            <p>THIS is the great
duty of our lives,
and ought to be the
chief business of us all
every day of them. No
Man knows what the
next hour may bring
forth, and to put our
Salvation, and the hopes
of eternity to so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64860:39"/>
a hazard as we do,
when we procrastinate
(though never so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle)
our <hi>working of it
out with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,</hi>
is to shew either
a very unwarrantable
presumption upon God's
goodness, or a very light
esteem of our own
Souls.</p>
            <p>2. OUR lives depend
on so many curious parts
and organs, so many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
assail them every
moment, so many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
may take them
from us, that we can
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64860:40"/>
never say the next mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
is our own; and
that he therefore who
neglects his salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to day, may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
danger put it off
to to morrows conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
God has told
us that his Spirit shall
not alway strive with
Man, but as he offers
to every one a space to
<hi>repent,</hi> so there is a time
too (if we omit that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity)
when there
<hi>shall be no longer any
space for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:64860:40"/>
AND how can any
of us tell that this hour
is not the last wherein
God will give us his
grace for so great a
work; so that though
we should live to see
the next, yet that then
our sentence shall not
be found already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
and we shall
not be able to repent,
though we never so much
desire it.</p>
            <p>3. SUCH obligations
therefore have we all

our ways,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 55.</note> 
               <hi>and turn
our feet to God's
testimonies:</hi> But, <hi>Madam,</hi>
it has pleased his great
goodness to lay more
than ordinary ties upon
you, to do this: He has
taken you off, by a
peculiar instance of his
Mercy, from the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and tempations of the
World: He has disabled
you from falling into
many sins; and calls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you to watch against
the rest; He has brought
you to an early know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of your self, and
of him, at an age when
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64860:41"/>
most others are the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of sin, and
creatures of vanity.
He has given you op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
from the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
and conversation
of the best Men, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
your duty,
your danger, and your
interest: And, <hi>Madam,</hi>
what you ought above
all things to bless him
for, he has given you a
heart too, to receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
and that is
desirous of his glory;
and though after so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
better means as you
have had of informing
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64860:42"/>
your self how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in this important
business; after the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
you have attain'd,
and the progress you
have made, there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
need for me to add
any thing on this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
yet I know I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
better satisfie your
piety, or discharge my
own duty, than by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before you, in a short
view, a prospect of your
labours, through which
you have so long been
travelling, and are now
so nearly come, to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:64860:42"/>
4. AT the first <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi>
when God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Man upon the Earth,
he planted in him a
Law teaching him his
<hi>whole Duty,</hi> he gave
him besides, a <hi>positive
Law</hi> not to eat of the
<hi>fruit of the tree
of Knowledge;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 17.</note>
and to perform
this, he added a perfect
strength and ability
whereby he might for
ever have lived without
the least sin; had <hi>Adam</hi>
done this, his perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(the <hi>Knowledge</hi> and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64860:43"/>
               <hi>Ability</hi> God created in
him) had still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
and after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
period of years,
which God should have
determined, he had been
rewarded with an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
to eternal fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.</p>
            <p>5. THIS is that which
is usually called THE
FIRST COVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NANT,
which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
fatally breaking by
his disobedience, soon
forfeited; and came short
of that Glory which
God had prepared for
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64860:43"/>
him: yet it pleased the
Lord to enter into a
SECOND with him,
the tenour of which was,
That <hi>the Seed of the
Woman should
bruise the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's
head:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> i. e. That
<hi>Christ</hi> taking our nature
upon him, and so becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>the seed of the Woman,</hi>
should perform that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of <hi>unsinning obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
which <hi>Adam broke,</hi>
and yet being fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
undergo a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and ignominious
death for him and his
Posterity; and so <hi>bruise
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64860:44"/>
the Serpent's head;</hi> i. e. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
us from the power
of the Devil, who by
this transgression had got
the dominion over us.</p>
            <p>6. AND this is that <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>
we now live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
the <hi>Promises</hi> of which
are * pardon of sins
through the blood of
Christ; * strength and
grace to perform the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
* and eternal
glory to reward our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
This is what
<hi>God</hi> on his part has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to us; for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisites
on ours, what
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64860:44"/>
we must do to obtain
these blessings, that is the
great business of us all to
know, and the peculiar
design of this place briefly
to consider.</p>
            <p>7. WHERE, first, I
must lay down this for
your encouragement, that
we are no longer now
tied to the heavy yoke of
a perfect, unsinning Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
not to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
any <hi>deliberate</hi> sin,
nay or even to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
in a <hi>habit</hi> and <hi>course</hi>
of it; but it is, * a sincere
endeavour to perform
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64860:45"/>
whatsoever God enables
us; * an unfeigned Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the whole Gospel
of Christ: and * a hearty
bewailing of our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
as often as we
come short of it; with
* a real<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> desire, and *
true endeavour of doing
better for the future.</p>
            <p>8. To enter on a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
consideration of this
would engage me to lay
before you a <hi>Summary</hi> of
the whole Gospel of
Christ: But, <hi>Madam,</hi> this
were to exceed the limits
of my design, &amp; you have
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64860:45"/>
abundant assistances for
this Knowledge, in those
excellent books which
you have chosen for the
companions of your Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels.
Only because cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it is that the very
best of us come short of
our duty, and stand in
need of God's pardon, and
forgiveness; I will briefly
lay before you the <hi>method</hi>
you are to take to obtain
this, in the particular
consideration of those
two great duties of <hi>Faith</hi>
and <hi>Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:64860:46"/>
               <head>Sect. I. Of Faith.</head>
               <p>TTHERE is scarce
any duty which
ha's been so obscured in
the writings of learned
Men as this. I will not
enter here into any of
their disputes, but briefly
say, what I think fit for
your practice and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of it.</p>
               <p>2. FAITH then is an
<hi>assenting to, or believing
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64860:46"/>
* the whole word of God,
but especially of his Gospel,
and of the</hi> * Commands <hi>&amp;</hi>
* Threats <hi>and</hi> * Promises
<hi>therein contained.</hi> This
is the nature of that
<hi>Faith</hi> which is required
of us, and it is then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
when it affords to
every one of these that
assent which is proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
to it, viz. 1. A firm
assent to whatever the
Gospel has revealed: 2.
an obediential submission
to the Commands: 3.
An humble fear and awe
of the Threats: and 4. a
fiducial relyance on the
promises of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:64860:47"/>
3. To have the first
of these you must in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
firmly believe, that
whatever God hath
said, is infallibly true; and
though in particular,
there be many revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which you cannot it
may be understand the
possibility of; as that
<hi>God became Man, was born
of a Mother still remaining
a Virgin; that he suffered
and died, and yet lives for
ever;</hi> yet must you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
conclude, that
since he has plainly told
you these things are so,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64860:47"/>
you ought firmly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him, seem they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so repugnant other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to your apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <p>4. To have the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi>
you must in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>assent</hi> to God's <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi>
that they are most
fitting, just, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
and that all men
therefore ought diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to fulfill them; and
in particular you must
resolve that by the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Heaven you
your self will.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:64860:48"/>
5. FOR the <hi>third</hi> you
must <hi>believe</hi> stedfastly
that these <hi>threats</hi> shall
certainly, as most justly
they ought, be executed
upon all those impenitent
Sinners against whom
they are denounced, and
that except you take care
to work out your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,
and get out
of the number of these
unhappy creatures, you
shall certainly find your
part in them.</p>
               <p>6. FOR the <hi>last</hi> you
are infallibly to <hi>believe</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:64860:48"/>
what God has <hi>promised;</hi>
especially that he will
<hi>give pardon of sin, and
everlasting salvation to all
humble and repenting sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi>
and for what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
to your own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
you are confidently
to rely upon his word,
that if you perform your
part, Christ will never
fail in his; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you ought to fulfill
those duties, which he
commands, and to which
alone this <hi>promise</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is given.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:64860:49"/>
7. IT is a question
which my little experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
lets me know do's
oftentimes trouble very
good Men, that certainly
their <hi>faith</hi> in this last in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
is not right, because
they still find it accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with <hi>fears and
doubts</hi> of their own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
But, <hi>Madam,</hi> you
must consider that the
<hi>faith</hi> which God requires
in this matter is only this,
<hi>That he will certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
all those that believe
in him, and obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments;</hi>
This we are
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:64860:49"/>
undoubtedly to assent to;
but now for the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
application of this
<hi>Faith</hi> to our selves, that
deserves no more of our
assent, nor can indeed
warrantably have it, than
what is founded on the
serious consideration of
our own performances.
Now though our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
bearing witness to
our sincerity, may give
us great cause to <hi>hope</hi> we
are in <hi>a State of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
yet is it no part of any
man's <hi>Faith</hi> undoubtedly
to <hi>believe</hi> it; Nay rather
some degree of <hi>fear</hi> and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64860:50"/>
                  <hi>trembling</hi> mixt with it
may be a good means to
secure us in our duty;
whilst a confident depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
is very often ill
grounded, and may cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
such a negligence as
will certainly ruine us.</p>
               <p>8. LET your endeavour
therefore be to fulfill
God's commands, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
as often as you fail
of it, and to hope for
pardon and acceptance of
him. Infinite reason you
have for all this; and
this will be sufficient for
your present comfort,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:64860:50"/>
and for your future ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance.
But if still, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
* the greatness of
the danger, or * glory
of the reward; * either
your desires of becoming
better, * or a true and
humble sense of your own
unworthiness (which is
almost the perpetual case
of the best persons) keep
your Soul under an awe
and a concern, and will
not suffer you to rise up
to that <hi>confidence,</hi> which
some Men, I fear, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantably
themselves
pretend to, I am sure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantably
require of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:64860:51"/>
others; Assure your self,
that whilst you firmly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce
in the general be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
<hi>That God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
all them that love
him, and doubt of</hi> your
self only because you <hi>fear</hi>
whether you do this so
well as you ought; this
<hi>doubting</hi> shall prepare
you to receive the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of your <hi>Humility,</hi>
but never bring you in
danger of any punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for your <hi>infidelity.</hi>

               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:64860:51"/>
               <head>Sect. II. Of Repentance.</head>
               <p>REPENTANCE is
usually defined to
be <hi>a change of mind, an
absolute entire conversion
of our Souls from sin to
God.</hi> It is not a thing to
be done at certain times,
as when we <hi>give an Alms,</hi>
we exercise a particular
<hi>act of charity;</hi> but 'tis a
<hi>state of life,</hi> and consists
in a continual sincere
practice of all those
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:64860:52"/>
duties which God has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
and a hearty sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
confession, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of better obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as often as we vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
any of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
               <p>2. THE passage to it
is difficult and uneasie;
It contains many steps
which the habitual sinner
will find it hard to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass.
I shall here consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
only <hi>four</hi> of the more
principal, and which are
ever found in that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
who truly lives in a
<hi>State</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:64860:52"/>
3. <hi>THE</hi> first <hi>is,</hi> To have
a true sense of sin, of
its Odiousness, and of
its danger.</p>
               <p>i.e. YOU must firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be convinced that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sin you commit,
sets you at enmity with
Heaven, and will (if not
forsaken) render you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of it: That to
persevere in any evil
course, is the way to
make you unhappy in
this Life, and shall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
throw you into
everlasting torments in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64860:53"/>
the next: Of all this you
must seriously perswade
your self, and that not
lightly and in general,
deceiving your own Soul;
but bringing it home to
your particular concern
in it; affecting your
mind, and engaging your
utmost endeavours to
avoid that evil, which
is thus odious to God, and
thus dangerous to your
Everlasting Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THE</hi> second <hi>step to this
Duty, is,</hi> To have a
hearty sorrow and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for your sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:64860:53"/>
4. AND this you must
endeavour after, not by
being <hi>frighted</hi> and <hi>terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi>
and so upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>troubled,</hi> as often
as you reflect on those
infinite evils your sins
are like to bring upon
you. There is no Man
living so wicked, but
would do the same; But,
<hi>Madam,</hi> you must really
sorrow that you have ever
sinn'd; That you have
provoked so loving and
merciful a Father; That
you have disobey'd so
gracious a Redeemer, and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:64860:54"/>
all to gratify your passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in some baser in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
which you ought
to abhor upon these
grounds alone, though
there were no punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
awaiting your
transgressions.</p>
               <p>5. NOR must this
<hi>sorrow</hi> and <hi>contrition</hi> be
only for the grosser evils
of our unregenerate
estate, but even when we
live best we must repeat
it as often as we trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
the divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
nay we should em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
it too, even upon the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64860:54"/>
                  <hi>weaknesses,</hi> the <hi>frailties,</hi>
the <hi>pollutions</hi> of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
our very <hi>proneness</hi>
and <hi>inclination to sin:</hi> for
however these (uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to) are no actual
transgressions; yet are
they matter of sorrow
and grief to every true
Christian, and therefore
ought to be part of his
<hi>humiliation</hi> also.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>third</hi> preparatory
to this Duty, is, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. AND this so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to our pardon, that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64860:55"/>
we have no promise of
any forgiveness without
it: To fulfill this you must
not satisfy your self to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
in <hi>general,</hi> That
you are a sinner; but you
must carefully remark,
and particularly enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
also, at least the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>kinds</hi> of sin whereof
you know your self guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
You must shew your
sense of them by <hi>aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating</hi>
them with all the
unhappy circumstances,
and heightning accidents
of them; and for the
rest, you must comprise
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64860:55"/>
your unknown and les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
sins under some such
general confession as
that of the holy <hi>David,
Who can tell how
oft he offendeth?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 19. 12.</note>
                  <hi>O cleanse thou me
from my secret faults.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. YOU will, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
doubtless expect
that I should here add
somewhat of another
sort of <hi>Confession,</hi> which
I have sometimes had
the honour to discourse
with you about; I then
told you that unless
some Accident rendred
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64860:56"/>
it so, I did not esteem
it <hi>absolutely necessary.</hi>
The expediency of it,
I must confess, I ever
much approved, and
have often wish'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
would do so too;
and the reasons I have
at large given you may
be summed up into
these: 1. That St. <hi>James</hi>
has advised us to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess</hi>
our <hi>faults one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
Chap. 5. 16. and
pray one for another.</hi> 2. If
we have injured ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then we ought to
go and <hi>confess</hi> our fault
to him, as ever we mean
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64860:56"/>
to obtain the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God. 3. But
if our sin belongs only
to him, yet to <hi>confess</hi>
to his <hi>Minister</hi> is in some
sort a fuller satisfaction
to his justice; It declares
our greater detestation
of that offence, for
which we are content
to commit this violence
upon our selves. It
gives us this comfort
too, that thereby we
get the opinion of our
<hi>Spiritual Guide</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the <hi>state</hi> of our
<hi>Repentance;</hi> and his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
and assistance for
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64860:57"/>
the perfecting of it;
and if we desire his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
absolution, we
must then make our
confession to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we can obtain it.
What force these mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
may have upon
you, I cannot tell; but
for the present you are
passing into a place
where you will have
little opportunity to
practise it, and should
therefore resolve to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
it, by a more due
and careful performance
of it to <hi>God Almighty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:64860:57"/>
THE <hi>last</hi> thing prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory
to a true <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi>
is, <hi>A firm
resolution and vow
of a new life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. THAT you will
immediately quit all
your <hi>Sins,</hi> and all the <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions</hi>
that are wont to
lead you into those sins;
That you will wholly
resign your self up to
the guidance of <hi>Christ;</hi>
and perform whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
you know to be his
<hi>will;</hi> and this do truly
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64860:58"/>
and sincerely all the
days of your life.</p>
               <p>9. AND here, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
behold in short the
duties that are required
of you: This is what
you must do to inherit
<hi>eternal Life;</hi> And if
you have (as I make no
doubt) already come
up thus far, you are
then firmly to persevere
in it unto the end; If
you fulfil this <hi>Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
though you * fall
sometimes by <hi>infirmity;</hi>
* are betrayed by <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
* or surprized
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:64860:58"/>
by some <hi>sudden,</hi> and
<hi>dayly incurring temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi>
* Nay, though you
should be so unhappy
as to fall into some
greater <hi>Act,</hi> even of
<hi>deliberate sin,</hi> which you
might have avoided, and
which you presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
by confession and
amendment, you are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
in a <hi>regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
estate,</hi> you live the
Life of a Christian here,
and shall inherit the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
that is promised
to him, in a glorious
Immortality hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:64860:59"/>
10. I SHALL close
this with my earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
which not any
doubts of your goodness,
but my real concern
for your welfare, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort
from me; that you
will seriously consider
your own state as to
this affair; Flatter not
your self, * neither a
<hi>transient sorrow</hi> that you
have sinned, * nor a
<hi>wish</hi> that you had not,
* neither a faint and
general, <hi>God be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
to me a sinner;</hi>
* nor an <hi>imperfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:64860:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not to be so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
longer; * not an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving,
for the rest, the
<hi>whole Law,</hi> if you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
your self but in
any one <hi>habit</hi> of sin;
* not praying to God
to give you his <hi>grace;</hi>
without your own sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
endeavours of using
it; nothing but a steady
<hi>resolution</hi> brought to
practice; God's grace
used, his commandments
obey'd as far as your
infirmities will permit,
and his pardon begg'd
where you have not;
This is that which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64860:60"/>
must save your
Soul, and carry you on
to that glorious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
him to give you
for his Son <hi>Jesus Christ's
sake.</hi>

            <p>I THOUGHT, <hi>Madam,</hi>
here to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

excellent and useful
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64860:61"/>
               <hi>Treatises</hi> you have so
wisely provided for that
purpose; But they speak
in <hi>general,</hi> and though
I know the care you
take to apply them to
your self, yet I cannot
but beg leave to add
two or three considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that may more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
be accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
to your particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
circumstances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That you duely
implore the blessings
of Heaven by your
constant <hi>Prayers</hi> to
God <hi>Almighty</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:64860:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I NEED not tell you
that you have * many
wants to be supplied,
* many blessings to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
* many sins to be
forgiven, and that there
is nothing can obtain all
these for you but your
prayers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or were you so
all-sufficient as not to
need the influences of
Providence to support
you, yet would sure
every day bring to your
remembrance slips and
infirmities to be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd</hi>
to him, to be sure
blessings and mercies to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64860:62"/>
be gratefully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
in a perpetual
return of <hi>praises</hi> and
<hi>thanksgivings</hi> to the
great Donor. Upon all
which accounts there can
never be any pretence
for your neglect of
that duty, which so
many continual engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
oblige you to.</p>
            <p>2. LET me to this,
add the great assistance
it will afford you in
the performance of all
the rest of your duty;
whilst thus you have
your <hi>conversation in
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:64860:62"/>
Heaven,</hi> all the
little goods here
below will seem
poor and inconsiderable
in your sight;<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 20.</note> this will
strengthen your <hi>patience</hi>
in bearing your calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
whilst with faith
you contemplate the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
end to which they
lead; It will raise in
your Soul the greatest
care of fulfilling the
divine will, lest you
lose so excellent a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
in a word; this
exercise will call down
the favour of Heaven
upon you, either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:64860:63"/>
those afflictions
you now labour under,
from you, or you from
them; will bring you
peace, and comfort, and
satisfaction in this life,
and an everlasting peace
and repose in the next.</p>
            <p>3. IT has been the
great discouragement of
some Christians in the
exercise of this <hi>duty,</hi>
that they do not find
these great <hi>Benefits</hi> of
their devotion: That
they are told indeed of
the mighty influences of
prayer: and have read
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:64860:63"/>
how that by it <hi>Joshua</hi>
changed the order of
nature, and made the
<hi>Sun stand still in the
midst of the Firmament;
Elias</hi> tied up the
<hi>Windows of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
that it rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
not <hi>for three
whole years in Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Josh. 10. 12. 1 Kings 17.</note>
               <hi>Hezekias</hi>
added <hi>fifteen years
to his life;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Kings 20. 6.</note> The <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
gave <hi>feet to the
Lame, Eyes to the Blind;</hi>
and <hi>even life to the
Dead;</hi> But themselves
are so far from working
such <hi>miracles,</hi> that they
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64860:64"/>
cannot so much as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the supply of those
ordinary wants they
very often labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>4. BUT, <hi>Madam,</hi> we
must not for all this
think either that the
Arm of the Lord is
shortned, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
or his will alter'd
that he should not hear
us, as well as he did
them; indeed for such
miraculous effects, we
have now no longer
need of them, and it
would therefore be a
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:64860:64"/>
fond presumption in us
to expect them; But
for the rest there are
two considerations which
Men would do well to
reflect on before they
charge God foolishly.</p>
            <p>1. WHETHER we do
not very often receive
the benefit of our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
when yet ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
we charge Heaven
with denying our Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>2. IF our Requests
are really deny'd, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the fault do's not
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64860:65"/>
ly at our own doors
that they are so.</p>
            <p>5. FOR the <hi>former</hi>
of these we may very
easily be mistaken, and
I doubt very often are
so: Did we indeed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
know the state
of our own condition,
and what was most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and convenient for
us, we might then have
some reason to conclude
our Prayers were not
heard, if our desires were
not answered: But now
that such is our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that though we
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64860:65"/>
are sensible enough of
the evils that lie upon
us, yet we cannot say
either whether they are
fit to be removed at
all; or when, or by
what means; or for
what state; we ought
to be very wary in our
thoughts of God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and not rashly
pronounce what we can
never be sure of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>6. SHOULD you
now, for instance, your
self, <hi>Madam,</hi> pray to
God for a <hi>recovery from
this sickness;</hi> how rash
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:64860:66"/>
would it be to accuse
God of not hearing your
Prayers, because you
found your Disease to
continue still? * It
may be he sees it has not
yet perfectly wrought
in you all those good
effects he intends; That
if you should at this
time recover your health,
it might occasion your
return to the sins and
follies of your age. *
It may be he intends
yet longer to prove your
vertue, that so he may
afterwards more plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
reward it; * Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:64860:66"/>
he punishes your
sins by it in this Life,
that he may spare you
in the next. Now if
these or the like are
the causes of your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
certainly you
could not have a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
injury done you, than
the removing of your
distemper: and those
Prayers you make for
a recovery are to be lookt
upon as best heard by
God, and best answer'd
for you, if they move
him to a longer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of your sickness.
Again: * Though God
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:64860:67"/>
does not answer your
requests in the very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
of your distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
it may be yet he
shews their efficacy in
supporting you with
strength and patience to
bear it; Infinite are the
methods of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and impossible
it is for us to trace
them all, and though
we are not able to
point out the very mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
which our devotion
has obtained, yet this
God has promised, and
we must therefore firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believe and rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:64860:67"/>
it, <hi>That if we ask,
we shall, we do, receive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. BUT here my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
consideration must
come in, St. <hi>James,</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the ineffectualness
of some mens Devotion,
tells them, <hi>Ye ask, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
not, because
ye ask amiss;</hi>
               <note place="margin">James 4. 3.</note> and
that I fear is too often our
condition; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that you may be able
both to know and avoid
this, I will beg leave,
<hi>Madam,</hi> to give you only
a short Catalogue of what
qualifications seem to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:64860:68"/>
me more immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
to render your
Devotion prevalent.</p>
            <p>1. TAKE heed that
the things you desire be
such as are fit for God to
give, and you to receive;
Let not any instances of
<hi>sin</hi> defile your requests;
and even in the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
matters, rather
beg in general the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
of God which he
knows requisite, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for your Soul or Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
than descend too
much to the particulars
your self, and prescribe
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:64860:68"/>
to him, who so little
understand your own
wants.</p>
            <p>Secondly BEFORE you
<hi>pray,</hi> clear your Soul from
all those sins which you
know displeasing to God
Almighty; for till that
be done he regards you as
his Enemy; and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
therefore expect that
he should reward you as
his servant.</p>
            <p>Thirdly PREPARE
your Soul with all those
necessary <hi>Graces</hi> that are
more immediately requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64860:69"/>
to this performance:
with <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;</hi>
with <hi>Faith</hi> in his
power and <hi>Hope</hi> of his
mercy, with <hi>Love</hi> and
<hi>Charity</hi> towards God and
towards your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
All which will
infinitely dispose him to
give, and prepare you to
receive.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, WHEN you
pray, let it be with <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,</hi>
with <hi>fervency,</hi>
with <hi>perseverance;</hi> To
which end I should think
it better that your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
were <hi>short</hi> and <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,</hi>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:64860:69"/>
than over long;
which only make them
tedious and uneasie to
you in your present state,
but never the more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God; who
delights not in mens
words, but requires their
hearts; and hears the
shortest <hi>ejaculation,</hi> as
certainly as the longest
prayer.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, IN a word:
Having pray'd, leave the
issue contentedly in his
hands: Let it satisfy you
that you have his promise
for your security, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:64860:70"/>
that if thus you make your
requests to him, you shall
sooner or later most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
find that
<hi>your labour has
not been in vain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 58.</note> 
               <hi>in the
Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A SECOND <hi>duty,</hi> that
I must more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
recommend to
you is <hi>Charity:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A GRACE That has
more promises annext to
it than any other moral
or theological vertue, St.
<hi>Paul</hi> prefers it even to
<hi>Faith</hi> it self, 1 Cor. 13.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:64860:70"/>
And could we have every
other vertue which the
Gospel enjoyns in the
highest perfection, yet
he plainly assures us that
without this, they would
all avail us nothing.</p>
            <p>2. CHARITY taken
in its largest extent is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but, <hi>The sincere
Love of God and our
Neighbour:</hi> The former
of these requires not only
your highest esteem of
him, your desires of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him, and filling
your self with his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
but also a sincere
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:64860:71"/>
endeavour to please and
obey him, to fulfill his
commands, and hate all
those things that he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes,
and may any way
set you at enmity with
him.</p>
            <p>3. THE latter enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
you to a universal
<hi>love</hi> of <hi>all Men,</hi> even
your very Enemies; to
retain no malice nor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
against any; to be
ready to do them all the
kindness you are able, by
reproving the Vicious,
instructing the ignorant,
relieving the poor; for
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:64860:71"/>
all which, you have the
peculiar promise of God
for your engagement;
and shall receive the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of your sins, and
everlasting glory for your
Reward.</p>
            <p>I MUST now hasten
to a conclusion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
will presume to add
only this one caution
more,</p>
            <p>I THIRDLY, that you
would take an especial
care <hi>how you employ your
time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:64860:72"/>
IT is not, <hi>Madam,</hi> for
me to divine what op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
you may have
for this, nor can I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
advise you any thing
in particular: Only let
me beg you to lose no
occasion of doing all the
good you can; which
whatever the issue of
your present sickness be,
is to be sure your duty,
and shall prove your bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
either in this World
or another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:64860:72"/>
2. I NEED not desire
you to spend the hours
you may have for your
friends and your diversion
innocently, but if I may
presume to speak my
thoughts in a matter of no
great importance, I should
perswade you not only to
do this, but even to deny
your self somewhat of
that full liberty which
others do usually allow
themselves; the Wise man
has told us, that <hi>Mirth
is not proper in the time
of sorrow;</hi> since it has
pleased God to lay his
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:64860:73"/>
inflictions upon you, You
ought so far (I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
said in civility to
him) to comply with
your circumstances, as
to be a little more reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
than otherwise were
needful, and though not
to fly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the other extreme
(which, I rather ought
to disswade you from)
yet to keep in such a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
as may both speak
you sensible, as you ought,
of your condition, and
yet not discontented at
God's dispensations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:64860:73"/>
3. BUT, <hi>Madam,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
your employs be,
let no day pass without
some time to retire into
your self, and either by
reading, meditating, or
some other pious exercise
to feed your zeal, and
confirm your devotion.</p>
            <p>4. LASTLY, in your
most busy occupations,
when you are never so
much taken up with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
affairs, yet steal now
and then a minute to the
<hi>thoughts of Heaven,</hi> send
up an <hi>Ejaculation</hi> to the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:64860:74"/>
God of your Salvation;
This is a piece of thrift
that by frequent exercise
will do you much good,
and yet never injure any
other business. <hi>Augustus
Caesar</hi> is highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the ancient Poet,
that in the midst of his
most troublesome occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations
he could still find
time to look up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and consider the
frame, and contemplate
the parts and motions
of it. How much
more should we always
be at leisure to reflect on
him that framed both
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64860:74"/>
that and us; to whose
<hi>Providence we owe</hi> every
minute of our lives,
and whom therefore we
ought, above all other
things, incessantly to
praise for his unspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Mercies.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="conclusion">
            <pb n="144" facs="tcp:64860:75"/>
            <head>CLOSE.</head>
            <p>AND now, <hi>Madam,</hi>
that I may close
with what I begun, after
so long an intrusion upon
your Meditations, with
these reflections, which
I am confident make a
great part of your dayly
entertainment; The only
thing that can render ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
these Papers or their
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:64860:75"/>
recommendations accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
unto you; that can
secure you against sin,
and endear Vertue and
Religion to your practice,
will be to raise your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
above this World,
by seriously considering
the excellence and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of another life;
and how vain and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient,
indeed how trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and unsatisfying are
the highest felicities of
this.</p>
            <p>2. I HAVE not here
time to delineate to you
the glories of God's hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64860:76"/>
Kingdom, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
could I tell you (if
I had) what the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of that place is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be, <q>
                  <hi>where all tears
shall be wiped from our
eyes, and there shall be no
more death, nor sorrow,
nor crying, nor pain;</hi>
               </q>When our Bodies shall be
freed from every disease;
our Souls from every
trouble; those shall be
chang'd into incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and immortal sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
these be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
with the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
and ravishing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and both continue
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:64860:76"/>
to be thus unspeakably
happy throughout all
Eternity, without the least
danger of either losing
or lessening their enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>3. BLESSED <hi>God!</hi>
How contrary is this to
our melancholy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable
portion here
below? a place, where
not a day passes, but we
eat our Bread with
sorrow and cares; The
present troubles us, the
future amazes us; and
even the past fills us with
grief and anguish. I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:64860:77"/>
to mention the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
evils which every
Man best knows by his
own experience: If we
look abroad upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
face of the World,
What do we see in the
several Kingdoms about
us, but Wars and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
all things running
to ruine, and destruction,
to the confounding and
devouring of each other.
If we consider the <hi>Church,</hi>
that holy Mother of us
all, how do her unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Children rend and
tear her sacred bowels
by their contentions?
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:64860:77"/>
What <hi>Schisms,</hi> What
<hi>Heresies,</hi> what <hi>Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
is there in it? On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Sin and Impiety we
agree on all sides; here
there is neither Jew nor
Gentile; but all are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in a monstrous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy
against God and
our own Souls.</p>
            <p>4. IF we contract our
view, and confine it to
our own sinful nation; It
has pleased God to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
us yet in peace, to
see if we will repent and
anticipate his Judgments;
But alas! his hand is
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64860:78"/>
lifted up to strike, and
we do nothing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the blow: and
what can we expect but
that it should at last fall
upon us to our confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>5. PARDON me,
<hi>Madam,</hi> if I freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
to you my fears, that
I tremble to think what
shall be the issue of so
great an Impenitence, as
we have now these many
years shew'd under all the
various methods of God's
Providence to redeem us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:64860:78"/>
6. HE has sent the
sword, both of civil Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and publick War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, and it has been
deeply stain'd in the
blood of the best and
chiefest of our strength;
Our <hi>Princes have been
forced into Captivity;
Our Church been chased
into the Wilderness; The
breath of our nostrils,</hi> the
<hi>Anointed of the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> has</hi>
been cut off by the vilest
of his Subjects, yet have
we not return'd, nor
sought our God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:64860:79"/>
7. THE <hi>Fire</hi> has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
our dwellings, the
<hi>Plague</hi> destroy'd its <hi>Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
and ten thousands in
our Streets,</hi> yet behold we
are still incorrigible, we
go on as before in the
ways of our own hearts,
and speak peace to our
souls even in the midst
of all these dangers.</p>
            <p>8. GREAT certainly
is our sin, and fatal, I
fear, shall be the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of it, and what
shall we do, (for, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
I must here beg
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:64860:79"/>
leave to joyn my self in
this reflection) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
our part in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
destruction? Let
us take heed that we
have no share in their
sins, and then by God's
mercy we shall have none
in the punishment. Let
us live as those who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
such trials, and
then he will either be
pleased to <hi>take us from
the evil to come,</hi> or <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us with his hand in
the midst of it:</hi> He will
to be sure with the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
make a way for us
to escape; and being
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64860:80"/>
past through this short
storm, will bring us to
that Port where we shall
find <hi>everlasting Rest,</hi> and
a <hi>consummated felicity;</hi>
               <q>Those blessings, <hi>which
neither Eye has seen,
nor Ear heard, nor does
it enter into the Heart
of Man to conceive;</hi>
               </q>
but <hi>which God has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for them</hi> that <hi>love
him:</hi> Among which bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
number that you
may then be found, as
it was the only inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of these reflections
to prepare you, so shall
it ever be the hearty
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:64860:80"/>
prayer of him who
with all imaginable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
and sincerity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,</p>
