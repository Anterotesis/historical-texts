            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>And the abundance of the earth, &amp;c.</hi> The husbandman by his tillage and <note place="margin">Doctrine 1.</note> labour hath abundance: whence we learne the fruite and profite of honeſt labour and husbandrie; it yeeldeth plentie and abundance. He which tilleth the land ſhall be ſatisfied with <note place="margin">Prou. 26. 19.</note> bread, but he that followeth the idle ſhall be filled with pouertie, viz. he that painfully trauelleth in his lawfull calling, to maintaine and vphold the ſtate wherewith God hath bleſsed him, ſhall haue abundance of all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsarie and good things: but ſuch as are idle ſhall be poore and miſerable, <note place="margin">Prou 23. 21.</note> for beggerie is their end. The ſower went out ſow, and although his labor <note place="margin">Math. 13. 23.</note> and ſeed were the ſame, yet the ſoyle


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21259:9"/>
was not alike, but the good ground made him amends, that his trauell was not in vaine, where ſome one corne yeelded an hundred fold, ſome ſixtie, ſome thirtie: for he that ſoweth <note place="margin">2. Cor. 9. 6.</note> liberally ſhall reape plentifully. And thoſe that break vp the fallow ground and ſow in righteouſneſse, ſhall ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reape after the meaſure of mercie: and God will raine downe a bleſsing vpon their paines, as the Prophet tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Hoſ. 10. 12.</note> alludeth and applyeth it to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall indeauours.</p>
            <p>One reaſon hereof is Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> vpon his owne ordinance, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpering both the worke &amp; the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. The bleſsing of the Lord (ſaith <note place="margin">Prou. 10. 22.</note> Salomon) maketh rich, not mans wit, and labour, nor any other meanes. And he onely ſhall with ioy eate the <note place="margin">Pſal. 128. 2.</note> fruite of his hands that feareth God, and is bleſsed: for otherwiſe it is in vaine to riſe early, and to lie downe <note place="margin">Pſal. 117. 2.</note> late, and to eate the bread of ſorrow:


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21259:10"/>
our paines are to no purpoſe, our carke and care to no end: though we eate and fret our hearts with worldly griefe, for the bettering of our eſtate: all the meanes we can vſe ſhall be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpent &amp; vnprofitable, without Gods ſpeciall bleſsing be present with vs. He that planteth and he that watereth <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 7.</note> are nothing of themſelues, but God alone, who by his gracious bleſsing giueth a moſt happy increaſe. For as the earth is the Lords, and the <note place="margin">Pſal. 24. 1.</note> fulneſse thereof: ſo he maketh it barren and fruitfull at his pleaſure. Beware therefore (ſaith Moſes to Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael) leſt thou ſay in thine heart, My <note place="margin">Deut. 8. 17. 18</note> power and the ſtrength of my owne hands hath prepared me this abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, but reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that it is the Lord thy God that giueth thee power to get ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the ſtate and condition of the earth is ſuch, by the meanes of <note place="margin">Reaſon. 2.</note> Gods curſe vpon the ſame, for mans


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21259:10"/>
ſinne, that now by nature it is ſo bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and fruitleſse, that except Adam and his brood get their bread with <note place="margin">Gen 3. 17, 18 19.</note> the ſweate of their browes, the earth will yeeld them nothing but briers &amp; brambles, thornes and thiſtles, &amp;c. Force it they muſt by their great toile and trauell, or elſe it will not be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. So that now the hand of the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <note place="margin">Prou. 10. 4.</note> maketh rich, but a ſlothfull hand maketh poore. Such onely as with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and honeſt labour go about their buſineſse and affaires, God will bleſse: but ſuch as are giuen to idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse and ſloth (neglecting their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or truſting to vnlawfull and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect courſes) ſhall ſurely want and come to nought. I paſsed (ſaith Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon) by the field of the ſlothfull, and <note place="margin">Prou. 24 30, 31. 32.</note> lo it was growne with thornes, and nettles had couered the face thereof; I conſidered it well, I looked vpon it, and receiued inſtruction. See the confuſion that idleneſse worketh, and


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21259:11"/>
the bitter fruits thereof, barrenneſse to the ground, and beggery to the perſon, euen to ſuch as haue the meanes and vſe them not.</p>
            <p>Therefore as the ſight hereof was for Salomons learning, ſo let it be for <note place="margin">Vſe. 1.</note> our inſtruction: that we vſe all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and induſtrie in our places and callings, vpon the poore meanes that God hath lent vs to that end. Let vs as Gods ſtewards be painfull &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in our places, vſe his gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 11.</note> well, employ our talents to his gaine and glory, and ſo to our owne <note place="margin">Mat. 24. 5.</note> good. For to him that hath ſhall be giuen, and to him that is negligent &amp; <note place="margin">Math. 25. 29.</note> careleſse, and ſo wanteth and hath not, ſhall in the end that litle be taken away which he hath. And ſeeing that the hand of the diligent maketh rich, and that God promiſeth a bleſsing to his owne ordinance, and hath ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied all lawfull meanes for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the curſe, let vs be carefull


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21259:11"/>
thus to auoide it, and obtaine a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: for God the good houſholder cannot abide to ſee any man ſtand i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle <note place="margin">Math. 20. 34.</note> in the market place of this world, but thruſts them out, and ſends them into his vineyard, ſo that they that <note place="margin">2. Theſ. 3. 10.</note> will not worke muſt not eate.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it reproueth thoſe that <note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> thinke their owne induſtry ſufficient to make them rich, and procure them food: whereas all the meanes in the world is in vaine without his bleſsing and care.</p>
            <p>And here let thoſe of the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> learne, that as their office and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is a ſpirituall husbandry and a painfull plow, ſo it muſt be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 9.</note> followed: for who ſo ſlacketh his <note place="margin">Luk. 9. 62.</note> hand from his plough, and looketh backe in this buſineſse, ſhall quickly make balkes, and ſo procure a barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse of his ſoyle. And as Gods word <note place="margin">Math. 13.</note> is the onely ſeed that they muſt ſow: ſo let them be carefull for the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21259:12"/>
and preſeruation of the ſame in the hearts of the people. And then let them not be diſcouraged, but comfort themſelues (in this thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſse calling to the world) by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and experience of the poore husbandman, that if they do their dutie they ſhall haue abundance of fruit by Gods bleſsing. And although the ſoyle of mens ſoules by nature be both barren and fruitleſse of good: yet their labour ſhall not be in vaine in the Lord. The husbandman muſt <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 58. 2. Tim. 2. 6.</note> labour before he receiue the fruites, he muſt plow and ſow, &amp;c. before he can looke for his crop and happy har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt. He muſt waite for the precious <note place="margin">Iam. 5. 7.</note> fruite of the earth: he goth forth wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <note place="margin">Pſal. 126. 6.</note> (as it were) to low his ſeed: but at the appointed time returneth with ioy, and bringeth his ſheaues; he may ſow in teares, but he ſhall reape in ioy.</p>
            <p>Secondly, abundance of fruite <note place="margin">Doctrine 2.</note>


               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:21259:12"/>
being attributed to the earth, it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teacheth vs: that the earth vſed in the kind is very ſufficient to relieue all the inhabitants thereof.</p>
            <p>God no ſooner had made man, but he prouided meate out of the earth for man; yea for men and beaſts and all liuing creatures in their kind. Firſt, God gaue man life vpon the <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 30 31.</note> earth, and then gaue him liuing out of the ſame. So carefull was God for mans ſuſtenance, that the things which ſhould maintaine him were made before him, and produced out of the earth for his prouiſion. See Gods wonderfull and particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence herein for all liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. God ſendeth the ſprings into <note place="margin">Pſal. 104. 10. 11.</note> the vallies, which run betweene the mountaines, to giue drinke to all the beaſts of the field, and to quench the wild Aſses thirſt: where likewiſe the fowles of the heauen do dwell, and ſing among the branches. He maketh


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21259:13"/>
alſo graſse to grow for the cattell, and hearbes for the vſe of man, that ſo he being ſtrengthned by the vertue of thoſe herbes and fruite of trees (his firſt appointed food) might bring <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 20.</note> foorth by his labor and trauell, bread and all manner of ſuſtenance out of the earth (husbanded and tilled in the ſweate of mans face) that ſo both ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 18. 19.</note> and beaſt may haue all manner of food miniſtred vnto them out of the ground, for the maintenance of their life. Yea God prouideth wine (ſaith <note place="margin">See Tremel.</note> Dauid) to glad mans heart, and oyle <note place="margin">Pſal. 104. 15.</note> to make his face to ſhine, and bread to ſtrengthen his heart. No prouiſion is wanting, either for his neceſsitie, pleaſure, or profite: for all the earth is filled with the fruite of his workes: So much as the birds haue their neſts and foode in the high trees and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars of Libanon, and the Storke her <note place="margin">Ver. 17. 18.</note> dwelling in the Firre tree. The Goats Roes, Does, and Conies, are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten: <note place="margin">23. 24. 27. 28. 31.</note>


               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:21259:13"/>
for whom he hath made the mountains and rocks for their refuge &amp; reliefe. Thus is the whole earth ful of thy riches, ô Lord, all creatures in their kind waite vpon thee, thou gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt them meate in due ſeaſon, and they gather it: thou openeſt thy hand and they are filled with good things, Glory be to thee for euer.</p>
            <p>Now the reaſon why God hath <note place="margin">Reaſon.</note> made the earth ſo plentifull for all kinde of prouiſion, is, for that as he hath ordained it to be (as it were) the mother of al liuing creatures here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: ſo likewiſe hath he fitted and furniſhed it to be as an able and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der nourſe to suckle them (as I may ſo ſpeake) with her breaſts, to bring them vp and ſuſtaine them. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when through drought and dearth it fails therin &amp; deceiueth the inhabitants, Men (ſaith the Prophet) ſhal lament for the teats, euen for the <note place="margin">Eſay. 32. 12.</note> pleaſant fields and the fruitfull vine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:21259:14"/>
Which doctrine ſerueth, firſt, to confute the muttering and murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> of wicked &amp; vnreaſonable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that blame the earth for her bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſse, and cry out of the vnkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse of the times and ſeaſons. But miſery (ſaith Eliphaz to Iob) cometh <note place="margin">Iob. 5. 6.</note> not out of the duſt, neither doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction ſpring out of the earth; but man is born to trauel as the ſparks fly vpward. The cauſe then of all wants and defects in the earth, is not in it, but in vs, who haue angred the Lord by our ſinnes: for as ſparkes come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hote fire, ſo doth ſinne proceede from our corrupt nature, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth Gods curſe vpon the whole earth and our ſelues. So ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: A fruitfull land God maketh <note place="margin">Pſal. 107. 34.</note> barren, for the ſins of them that dwel therein. And he threatneth by Moſes that for the ſinnes of the people, the <note place="margin">Deut. 28. 23.</note> heauens that are ouer their head ſhall be braſse, and the earth that is vnder <note place="margin">Agge 1. 10.</note>

Againe, it is many times mans idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse and ſlothfulneſse that cauſeth barrenneſse and want: and the cruelty of oppreſsors in decaying of needfull tillage, that procureth penury.</p>
            <p>This point alſo ſerueth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne <note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> all wretched Atheiſts, who ſo mightily cry out and complaine of the increaſe of mankind, ſuppoſing the earth cannot ſuffiſe them; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtil for plagues, that ſo they might haue plenty. And what is this elſe but to raile againſt heauen, and ſo helliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to blaſpheme the Lord God of hoaſts himſelfe? and to make the earth (ſo kind and fruitfull) as an vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall mother and ſtepdame to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</p>

               <hi>Is ouer all:</hi> That is, excelleth all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther increaſe. Whence we learne in <note place="margin">Doctrine 3.</note> the third place, that there is no world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bleſsing to the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fruit of the earth by meanes of tillage. Now to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit many thouſand commodities which the ground bringeth forth, &amp; to come to our bread which the earth procureth by corne and grain ariſing from husbandry and tillage: what is able to weigh with this bleſsing in the ballance, which is ſo neceſsary for the life of man, that our Sauiour tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches vs to pray eſpecially for it, not ſo <note place="margin">Math. 6. 11.</note> much as once mentioning any other thing? For what are gold and ſiluer, pearls and pretious ſtones to this our daily bread? And therfore it is rightly called the ſtaffe of bread, being the <note place="margin">Leuit. 26. 26.</note> ſtay of our life, as the ſtaffe to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; aged; which God threatneth <note place="margin">Eſay 3. 1.</note> to breake when he will puniſh a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked people, ſo that they ſhal eate their bread by weight with care: and on <note place="margin">Ezeck. 4. 16.</note>


               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:21259:15"/>
the contrary, that he will bleſse the bread and water of thoſe that ſerue him: ſo that they ſhall eat their bread <note place="margin">Exod. 23 26. Leuit. 26. 15.

Therefore ſaith the Prophet, when the vallies ſhall be couered with corne, men ſhall ſhout for ioy and ſing; yea and all the creatures ſhall clap their hands (as it were) in their kind, and reioyce with mirth, when our garners and corners <note place="margin">Pſal. 144. 13.</note> of our houſes are ful with diuers ſorts of ſtore (the want whereof cauſeth the husbandman to be aſhamed:) <note place="margin">Ioel 1. 11.</note> this is a bleſsed thing euen in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Gods Prophet.</p>
            <p>Now the reaſon why this plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <note place="margin">Reaſons.</note> kind of increaſe is ſo incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is, for that it is welnigh the life &amp; liuing of man and beaſt.

bread, and take my birthright: what is it to me being almoſt dead? And how pitifull is Ieremies complaint for his deſolate people in the famine, for want of food? All the people ſigh <note place="margin">Lam. 1. 11.</note> (ſaith he) and ſeeke their bread, they haue giuen their pleaſant things for meate, to refreſh their ſoule. The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and ſucklings ſwoone in the ſtreets, they haue ſaid to their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, where is bread and drink, when <note place="margin">Cap. 2. 11. 12.</note> they gaue vp the ghoſt in their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers boſome? They that did feede delicately, periſh in the ſtreets: they <note place="margin">Cap. 4. 5.</note> that were brought vp in ſcarlet, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the dung. The Nazarites that were purer then the ſnow, whiter <note place="margin">Verſe 7.</note> then the milke; that were more rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in body then the red pretious ſtones, and like the poliſhed Saphir; their skin, now for want of food, <note place="margin">Verſe 8.</note> cleaueth vnto the bones, and withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth like a ſtocke, their viſar is now blacker then a coale; ſo that they that

are ſlaine with the ſword, are better then they that are killed with hunger, <note place="margin">Verſe 9.</note> for they fade away as they were ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken through for the fruits of the field. So ſharpe are theſe euill arrowes of <note place="margin">Ezeck. 5. 16.</note> famine for want of food and fruits of the earth. Hunger pierceth the heart of man with as ſenſible a pain as doth the ſharpe point of a dagger or dart, becauſe it directly fighteth againſt the life of man, and he dieth a moſt painfull death (though not ſo violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) whoſe deadly wounds do longer pricke him. A ſhorter puniſhment (though heauier) doth not kill the heart ſo much as that which is of lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger continuance, though lighter. Therefore to auoide this extremitie of famine, the poore people are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained <note place="margin">Nehem. 5. 3.</note> to gage their houſes &amp; their vineyards and their land, to take vp corne for their family. And the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians gaue to Ioſeph for corne and <note place="margin">Gen. 47. 15.</note> bread, not onely all their money that

they could make, but ſold to him their Horſes, Aſses, Sheepe, &amp;c. yea them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues as ſeruants and ſlaues to Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh for want of bread. And Elies ſonnes will bow for a morſell of <note place="margin">1.

            <p>The vſe is, to teach vs: firſt, that whenſoeuer God pincheth vs with <note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> the want of this bleſsing of bread and ſtore of the fruits of the earth, that then in anger he threatneth the taking away of our liues, ſhooting his euill arrowes of famine to wound our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Ezeck. 5. 16.</note> ſoules.

ſo neceſsary, &amp; ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the king &amp; his ſubiects: we learn in the laſt place, <note place="margin">Doctrine 6.</note> that there is no ground or field ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsary and fruitfull as that which is in tillage. The ſeed which the ſower <note place="margin">Math. 13. 18.</note> went out to sow in good ground (by his good husbandry, labour, and Gods bleſsing vpon the ſame) for one corne yeelded an hundred fold, for ſome other, ſixtie fold, and for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thirtie. And it is reported of <note place="margin">Gen. 26. 12.</note> Iſaacks crop of ſowing ſeed, in the land of Abimelech king of the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that he reaped the ſame yeare an hundreth sold by eſtimation: ſo the Lord bleſsed him, ſaith the text. And indeed, who is able to reckon vp the great increaſe of corne and graine that God doth raiſe out of the earth, by this his bleſsed ordinance of til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage and good husbandrie, filling our houſes, barnes, and garners, beſides our rickes, houels, ſtackes, &amp; heapes of graine without number and meaſure,

            <p>The reaſon why ſuch abundance <note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> of fruite proceedeth of tillage, is firſt, the naturall barrennes of the earth, in regard of Gods curſe vpon the ſame, by the meanes of mansſinne, which now without painfull plowing will not be profitable and plentifull.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the bleſsing of God vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his owne ordinance, when man <note place="margin">2.</note> doth diligently and chearefully ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelfe vnto the ſame, in the Chriſtian vſe thereof, as more largely was ſhewed before in the reaſons of the ſecond doctrine.</p>
            <p>Which ſerueth to confute the


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:21259:32"/>
proud conceite of many graceleſse Graziers, and the preſumptuous reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of many greedie decayers of tillage, which ſet their acres decayed at ſuch an incomparable valuation, ſo exceedingly multiplying their rents and reuenewes. Their great ſtockes and ſtore of all kind of cattell, ſo eaſily heeded, and maintained, without great charge or toile, makes now their preſent ſtate (as they ſuppoſe) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matchable: ſo that now they ſcorne at Iobs wealth (like Atheiſts) being farre beyond him, in oxen, ſheepe, &amp; all kind of cattell. Yet here (I aſsure them) is ſome difference, that his land cried not out againſt him, nor <note place="margin">Iob. 31. 38. 39</note> the furrowes thereof made any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint in his conſcience: and that he neuer eat the fruites thereof without ſiluer, nor grieued the ſoules of the maiſters thereof, as theſe men do in euery place.</p>
            <p>Their innumerable tods of wooll,


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21259:33"/>
their heards and droues of fallings ſufficient for the ſeruice of Court and countrey, they eſteeme to be an incomparable credit, and gaine.

            <p>Theſe kind of men (perhaps) rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon well for their owne perſons and places: but where is their care for the Prince, and Gods people; for the Church and commonwealth? Their fields (I confeſse) find many beaſts, but the field that is ſowne, feedeth both men and beaſts. And here note thy charitie toward thine owne fleſh: Thou careſt for cattell, and art care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſse <note place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 9.</note> of Chriſtians. Thou art kinde to thy ſelfe, and regardeſt not the ſtate of the king and his ſubiects, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt by the field that is tilled. But let the very beaſts conuince thee, the Bees, and all creatures in their kinde who are not made for themſelues, but for the common good. The ſheepe yeeld both fell and fleſh, the birds and beaſts, their yong ones and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues;


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:21259:34"/>
the Bees their honey, the Oxe treadeth out the corne, and the horſe <note place="margin">1.

            <p>But admit thou hadſt thine owne will, in turning commons into pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, and tilled fields into cloſing for thy cattell; where in the end wold be thy bread, without plowing and ſeedes time? Therefore when God would take away the curſe of the world, he bringeth in this bleſsing, that ſeedes time and harueſt, cold and <note place="margin">Gen. 8. 22.</note> heate, ſommer and winter, day and night ſhould not ceaſse, whileſt the earth remained. But theſe men by their crueltie would bring all to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, that the world cannot ſtand,


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:21259:34"/>
if they be not ſtayed. And ſo iuſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre the curſe of God, and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: for as a bleſsing ſhall be vpon the <note place="margin">Pro. 11. 26.</note> head of him that ſelleth corne: ſo he that withdraweth it, the people will curſe him: for as the one prouideth for their neceſsitie, ſo the other mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſse men (by decaying of tillage, and keeping in of corne) do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure poore mens miſerie. Now if it be ſuch a curſed ſinne, to withdraw the corne in the daies of dearth, to make it dearer, that ſo men may vtter the very reffuſe of their graine at any <note place="margin">Amos. 8. 5. 6.</note> rate: as thoſe tyrannous oppreſsours did in the daies of Nehemia, who cauſed their brethren to gage their <note place="margin">Neh. 5. 3. 5. 8. 9</note> lands, vineyards, and houſes, yea to ſell their ſonnes, and themſelues as ſlaues, for corne: how much more intollerable an oppreſsion is it, to take away all neceſsary meanes of proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by tillage and husbandry? For if theſe men might preuaile, no corne


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21259:35"/>
would be come by for any coine, for any ſuite or ſeruice, for any pricke or priſe. For where no oxen are, there the crib is emptie, but much increaſe <note place="margin">Prou. 14. 4.</note> cometh by the ſtrength of the oxe. Where the means of good husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is neglected, there is want of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsaries, but by the diligent tilling of the land by teames and ſtrong cattell fit for plowing, there is plentie and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce both for man &amp; beaſt. How can ſuch men pray, Giue vs this day our daily bread, that daily take away <note place="margin">Math. 6. 11.</note> the meanes of bread?

how theſe vnnaturall oppreſsours of their brethren, cauſe the people (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times) to murmure againſt their God, and to blaſpheme his name. Beſides the ſtrange rebellions, and outragious vproares and vpriſings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Prince and countrey. But is it not a wonder (to vſe the words <note place="margin">Lib 1.

And is it not vnnaturall (ſaith another) to turn men out to bring in ſheep? Yet if they wil needs maintaine large paſtures, and ſtocke them with ſheepe, remember what God ſaith by Ezechiel: The ſheepe of my paſture are men, &amp; we <note place="margin">Ezech. 34. 31.</note> are his people and the ſheep of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; and the image of God in one <note place="margin">Pſal. 95. 7. &amp; 100. 3.</note> man is more worth then al the ſheepe in the world.</p>
            <p>Therfore to conclude with exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <note place="margin">Concluſion.</note> let ſuch as beare the face and haue the feature of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ceaſse now to be ſuch monſters any more: let not thoſe that are called, and would needs be accompted Chriſtians, be worſe then Cannibals.
