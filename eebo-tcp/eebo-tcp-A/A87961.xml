            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Letter from SCOTLAND,
Giving a full and impartiall Relation of the ſcattering of thoſe
Forces riſen againſt the Parliament; Being all taken Priſoners by Lievtenant-Generall
<hi>David Leſly,</hi> and now remaining in his
hands at Mercy. With a true Accompt of all thoſe Officers of State removed
which had a hand in the late Engagement againſt <hi>England:</hi> With the Names
of thoſe placed in their roomes by the Parliament of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AS with you ſo with us divine diſpenſations are wonderfull; albeit for a while in the Lords manifold wiſdome he is pleaſed to
let men more unrighteous perſecute his owne People, yet his anger is but for a moment; an earneſt whereof we in this poore
Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> have often taſted, and eſpecially now in the midſt of many both feares and dangers, He hath given us
wherewith to ſay, <hi>verily there is a God that judgeth the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This day Letters are come from the Generall-Lievtenant <hi>David Leſly</hi> out of the North, ſhewing us that by the good hand of
Gods Providence upon our Forces of the Parliament, the very conſiderable Forces of that rebellious late inſurrection are diſſipated
and ſcattered, and the Leaders thereof all taken, and are at this time Priſoners at Mercy.</p>
            <p>And that which fils up the meaſure of the Mercy, in all this there was not one drop of bloud ſpilt. I ſhall not for the preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to give you the particulars, only a briefe and ſhort accompt: That is to ſay, in the Generall, <hi>Pluskardy,</hi> Brother to the Earle of
<hi>Seaforth,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Cromarcy,</hi> Maſter <hi>Montroe</hi> of Lemlaire, and Collonell <hi>Fraſer,</hi> having by their power drawn a very conſiderable
Body together, did thereby much encourage thoſe of their Faction, eſpecially in that part of the Country, to joyne with them.
But the Lievtenant-Generall approaching towards them, the Lord ſtrucke them with ſuch feare and terrour, that of themſelves they
mouldred away to nothing: Inſomuch that their Leaders were neceſſitated to ſecure themſelves with their owne Followers at the
next ſafe Paſſages; where they were all ſurpriſed by the Lievtenant-Generall, and are all now (as I ſaid before) his Priſoners at
Mercy. In this we behold a Morning-Star appearing, which gives us hopes of a glorious Riſing-Sun, and yet we ſee more, and look
upon this as an omen of Gods diſpleaſure, againſt all ſuch troublers of his People: And for any others, whatſoever they are, that
ſhall threaten Invaſion of this Kingdome, It is the reſolution both of Church and State to keep cloſe to their Covenant, and never
to vary from their firſt principles, truſt in that God with the iſſue, who hath owned them from the beginning, and hath delivered
them from the troubles of their owne People, bred in the bowels of their owne Nation, will alſo deliver them from the violence of
others: Nay, I dare aſſure you they feare not their feare.</p>
            <p>No doubt but ye have heard of the pious and honourable Proceedings of our preſent Parliament againſt the late Ingagers for the
invading our Brethren of England. I ſhall at this time give you but a ſhort and briefe accompt thereof.</p>
