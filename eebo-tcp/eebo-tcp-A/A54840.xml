         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Now whether these words, <hi>Rejoyce
evermore,</hi> which are confessedly <hi>Apostolical,</hi>
contain a <hi>Precept,</hi> or an <hi>Advice;</hi> they prove
it <hi>possible</hi> and <hi>lawful,</hi> for a Follower of CHRIST
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34977:3"/>
to be <hi>still Rejoycing.</hi> For were it <hi>impossible</hi> to
be done, St. <hi>Paul</hi> would be so far from <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding</hi>
the practice of it, that he would not
so much as <hi>commend</hi> it to us: and were the
practice of it <hi>unlawful,</hi> he would neither <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend</hi>
nor <hi>recommend</hi> it, but severely stigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize,
and forbid it rather. It follows then that
we <hi>can,</hi> and that we <hi>may</hi> Rejoyce always in
all Conditions; that is, with such a <hi>true</hi> joy
as St. <hi>Paul</hi> alludes to, which is not <hi>Carnal,</hi> but
<hi>Spiritual;</hi> not an <hi>Outward,</hi> and <hi>Superficial,</hi>
but an <hi>Internal</hi> and <hi>solid</hi> Joy: Not the Joy
of a Worldling, or of Riotous Debauchee, which
stands in temporary Fits of sport and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
(For a vicious Man may <hi>laugh</hi> with an
<hi>heavy Heart;</hi>) But the <hi>never-failing Ioy</hi> of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely

Joy, which alone is real, is nothing else
but the <hi>serenity and satisfaction of a Man's
mind;</hi> ever at peace within it self, because it
does <hi>nil conscire sibi,</hi> hath no false dealing, or
Unsincerity to disturb it,<note place="margin">Acts 24. 16.</note> as being <hi>void of all

<hi>True Ioy;</hi> Joy which will be <hi>True to us;</hi> on

St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorted his Converts to <hi>Rejoyce,</hi> and
<hi>to rejoyce evermore,</hi> when they were under
the <hi>Persecutions</hi> of <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gnosticks. Then</hi>
it was when he exhorted them to <hi>Rejoyce in

he saw there was no <hi>true</hi> Rejoycing. So said
he touching himself, in the 10. Verse of that
Chapter, <hi>But I rejoyced in the Lord greatly.</hi>
He rejoyced in the Lord with a <hi>Christian</hi> Joy;
with a Joy, whereof the Lord CHRIST was the
only Author, and so he rejoyced <hi>through the

those Heathen Goddesses of <hi>Ioy</hi> and <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>
which he derided, were still at odds, and
impatient of an Agreement, <hi>God</hi> (says the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thologist)
<hi>ty'd them together by the Necks;</hi> that
if they would not be friends, they might be
forced to be <hi>Companions. A Fable</hi> I should
not here mention, but for the <hi>Pertinent
Moral</hi> of it; That God is able to reconcile the
greatest Opposites in Nature; Pain and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
Joy and Sorrow, Prosperity and Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in the Soul of any Prudent and Pious
Man. And accordingly, when 'twas said by
the Royal Prophet,<note place="margin">Psal. 94. 19.</note> That <hi>in the multitude of
the sorrows which he had in his heart, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of God did refresh his soul;</hi> he spake and
acted as Inspired by the <hi>Holy Ghost the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter.</hi>
Comforts he had in the <hi>midst</hi> a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of sorrows; and in the midst of <hi>those</hi> sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
which he had in his <hi>Heart</hi> too: wherein
the Comforter from above did not only <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh,</hi>
but <hi>Delight</hi> his Soul, (for so our New
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34977:5"/>
Translation hath it.) And even the Carnal
Man will grant, that the <hi>Pleasure</hi> of <hi>the Soul</hi>
is <hi>the Soul of Pleasure.</hi> I say, St. <hi>Paul</hi> might
have profited by some of those Heathen Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
whom he professeth to have perused: But
'twas by <hi>Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 11, 12.</note> and <hi>Christ alone,</hi> by whom he
grew <hi>perfect</hi> in his Lesson, to be content in all
Cases. A Lesson he had <hi>learned</hi> (he tells us
plainly) and been throughly <hi>Instructed</hi> in; It
was not got without <hi>Study,</hi> nor yet without
going to School to his <hi>Master Christ;</hi> who did
not only enrich him with <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
of all his Duties, but (which <hi>no other</hi>
Master could do) gave him <hi>Ability</hi> to <hi>perform</hi>
them. For having told us what he had <hi>learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
and how far he had been <hi>instructed, every
where, and in all things both to be full, and to
be hungry, both to abound, and to suffer need;</hi>
He immediately added, that all his sufficiencies
were of <hi>Christ;</hi> not of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> or of <hi>Zeno,</hi>
or of any other Teacher, or of himself: But,
saith he,<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>I can do all things through Christ that
strengtheneth me.</hi> As our Rejoycing must be
<hi>in him,</hi> so <hi>by him</hi> and his <hi>strength,</hi> shewing it
self in our <hi>Weakness;</hi> through him and his
<hi>wisdom,</hi> shewing it self in our Folly; with his
<hi>Power</hi> and <hi>All-sufficience,</hi> shewing it self in our
<hi>Wants</hi> and <hi>Imperfections;</hi> we can <hi>rejoyce ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,

Lastly, he who can say with <hi>Christ Himself</hi> in

because <hi>the love of God is shed abroad in our
