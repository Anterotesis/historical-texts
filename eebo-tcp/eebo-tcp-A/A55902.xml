         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Worſhipful
Sir RICHARD BROWN,
Eldeſt Clerk of his Majeſties moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Privy Council.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IF it be a ſolid Pleaſure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
on thoſe Portions of our
Life, not only which have paſt
away in a ſmooth tenour of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted
Felicity, but rather on
ſuch as have been exerciſed with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous
Sufferings, which have been
undertaken with Juſtice, ſuſtained
with Courage, and crowned with an
happy deliverance: I hope you will
not be offended at my preſuming to
call you to a review of the twenty
<pb facs="tcp:101520:3"/>
years of Cardinal <hi>Mazarines</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
in this Piece pretending to ſome
more curious Remarks on the late
<hi>French</hi> Hiſtory. You were then ſet
to maintain a difficult Station in that
Court, during our Civil Wars, and
Tragical Confuſions. It was no mean
Province to withſtand the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a prevailing Faction: to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
an <hi>entire King</hi> under almoſt a
<hi>total Eclipſe</hi> of Majeſty: amidſt the
Spoils of your own Fortunes ſuperad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the Invaſion of your Maſters
Revenue, to retain <hi>Splendour, Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,</hi>
and <hi>Beneficence,</hi> of which I
muſt ever bear an honourable and
grateful Teſtimony. But, Sir, how
you could ſue to that <hi>Purple</hi> which
owes nothing to the Welfare of thoſe
Powers that would never <hi>adore</hi> it;
how you could appear before <hi>His
Eminence,</hi> not having made way by
the Tributes paid to <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants;
<pb facs="tcp:101520:3"/>
and could ſometimes convince
him in a Royal Cauſe, without co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Arguments fetched from both
the <hi>Indies,</hi> is a dexterity of Addreſs
above my comprehenſion. Then
was your Houſe the Roof under
which that Ark which was born be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Soveraign in all his Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
ſojourned, and you like <hi>Obed-Edom</hi>
found it a Bleſſing to your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.
And at length ſuch was the
Iſſue of your Negotiation, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſeen the Divine Goodneſs tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
over the oppoſite Powers and
Policies of men both at home and
abroad, in the Reſtauration of our
Rightful and Natural King, you
were by him called home to the reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fruits of your patient conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
in Duty, in the Exerciſe of
your former Charge of being near his
Sacred Perſon, and attending on his
Privy Council.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101520:4"/>
Here, Sir, although your conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſtand upon the moſt firm Bottom
of ſo tryed a Faith to ſo gracious a
Prince, yet you well comprehend
what is a Paradox to the ſecurely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,
that in this Scene of Life, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
is more fugacious than Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fity:
for, diſcounting the Period of
Death common to all, the Happy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
many Enemies, whilſt the
Miſerable find but few Friends; or
rather becauſe our own degenerate
Nature is more ſoft to comply with
the Charms of Pleaſure from ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding
Plenty, though they have a
tendency to our certain Ruine; than
it is daring to put forth the Efforts of
Induſtry under the diſcouragements
of Want, which might cooperate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
our Preſervation: you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being aviſed that Sublunary
Happineſs is not unmovable, arm
againſt future Contingencies, and
<pb facs="tcp:101520:4"/>
ſtand in a Poſture of the ſame Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
Self-denial, Compaſſion, and all
thoſe other amiable Vertues, which
are the Fruits of a well-born Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>Since therefore none is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
to the Secret of <hi>France,</hi> as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been ſo long exerciſed in the
Policy and Civility of that Nation,
be pleaſed to aſſiſt at this diſſecting
of the Soul of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> and perhaps
you may from thence divine the Fate
of <hi>Europe.</hi> This Author is no <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſt;</hi>
for he looks upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Religion as an Innovation of
no long Continuance, he means for
the future; but a <hi>Venetian Catholick
grafted into the Gallican Church.</hi> In
the point of Supremacy ever jealous
of Power, leſt the Secular ſhould
Lacquay whilſt the Eccleſiaſtick rides.
The main Subject of this Treatiſe is
an high Commendation, and without
<pb facs="tcp:101520:5"/>
Exception, but upon prevaricating
Topicks; whilſt he introduces a
Church-man ſucceſsful in embroil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the World, and Victorious over
the moſt Catholick Arms to advance
the moſt Chriſtian Intereſt. To ſay
the truth for or againſt other Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

            <p>
               <hi>Non eſt de tetricis, non eſt de magna

a Cavalier, ſo Reverent to Superiors,
as ſtill without violation of Truth:
and therefore ſuſpenſe, Oracular,
pregnant with two Senſes through
the Ambiguity of Phraſe, or Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
with a ſingular Artifice of

the Tranſlation, whereby you
will encourage the Endeavours of
him, who, as ever bound, daily prays

SERENE DUKE,
AND
AUGUST SENATE
OF THE
Republick of VENICE,
BENJAMIN PRIOLO
Wiſhes Proſperity, Victories, Triumphs.</head>
            <p>THis is the firſt Monument of my
Wit, <hi>Moſt Serene Prince</hi> and
<hi>High Lords,</hi> which I readily
and thankefully conſecrate to
your renowned Name in that
Language, which was once the Band of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and now continues the Repertory of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.
It is the Miniſtry of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> an
<pb facs="tcp:101520:6"/>
Hiſtorical Abridgment of our Affairs from
the Deceaſe of <hi>Lewis XIII.</hi> to this very day,
and the Dawn of this moſt bleſſed Age, wherein
the Sun-ſhine of Peace hath riſen upon us. It
borrows Luſtre and Protection from you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Detraction and Envy. Owne it, My
Lords, and communicate of your Brightneſs to
it: For this is within the Verge of your Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
who are able to extol or depreſs with the
ſingle Reputation of your Judgments. Vpon
a manifold Title doth this Book lay claim to
your Patronage, who will diſcover in our late
Tranſactions the Tracks of your Prudence.
For when our Country was embroiled in the
Tumults of civil Diſſenſion, that Commander
who recovered us from a moſt unquiet to a moſt
glorious State, was Honourably Enfranchiſed
by You, who are ſo united with us by an eternal
League and common Intereſt of State, that
our Adverſities have always been an Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to your Republick; and ye have with
joy received the News of this Empires good
ſucceſſes, ever ſince the Foundation of both
Nations that are contemporary. This Work
being full of Politick Maxims and Preſidents,
to whom ſhould it more juſtly addreſs than to
the moſt Politick Stateſmen? Whom doth it
better ſuit than thoſe who are the Pattern to all
the World of a perfect Government? The

whole Subject, Vertues, or Sloth. Them we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
by relating; and you are a great
inſtance, who have, and always have had
them. This we decry, which in all Ages you
have been clear of, either by avoiding, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming
it. Plainly Rivals of thoſe, who
having been daunted with no wound of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunc,
after <hi>Trebia, Thraſymen,</hi> and <hi>Cannae</hi>
held out stoutly, you never ſunk under miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes;
but have obliged the <hi>Turk,</hi> the

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt Potent of Empires in the World, ſo often
to retreat before your Forces, and the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
which attends your Arms; whileſt the
chief Monarchs of <hi>Europe</hi> were bloodily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
againſt one another, upon trivial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
to the ruine of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> whoſe
Bullwark and Admiration you are. Nor
doth the matter only invite and ſollicite
your Authority, to grace the Front of this
Labour, being ſmall in Bulk, though perhaps
that ſhall be eternal in duration; but much
more my grateful mind, which preſents you
with your own gifts. In like manner, as
when we Sacrifice and bring oblations to God,
it is for our own, and not his benefit. For if I
am ſome-body, my <hi>Lords,</hi> if a Candidate of
Fame, if enrolled in the Catalogue of them, who
do not promiſe, but confer immortality; thanks
be to you, in whoſe Boſome I have been edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.
<pb facs="tcp:101520:7"/>
Firſt of all, That your City Founded
by <hi>Antenor,</hi> my Nurſe, the ſweet Mother of
Arts, the Fruitful Seminary of Induſtry,
the Fat Soil of Vertues, implanted in me her
Principles: Which how greatly you eſteem,
we collect from hence, becauſe that one Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
of <hi>Padua,</hi> hath more Schollars in it,
then whole Kingdoms beſides. This taught
me to look down from the lofty Tower of a
rightly informed judgment, upon Vulgar Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors;
and to diſcover upon true Grounds,
with what groſs darkneſs the ſeeming light of
frail mortality is Eclipſed. After that I
Travelled to <hi>Venice,</hi> the joy and darling of
Heaven, the Shop of Policy, the School of
Wiſdom; where I ſearched into the Myſtery
of your Government. This doth not deliver
a Prince to be made up of wicked Plots,
falſhood, and a dedolent Spirit hardned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all remorſe of Conſcience; not of ſubtle
Devices, or Craft, but of Sincerity and Faith;
whoſe venerable Name holds out among you
her right hand, the Security of the Worlds
Peace. A Republick happy in its Orders,
with which, as with Ligatures, it ſtands un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken
without fear of fall; boaſting of its
duration for 1300 years. And what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
when ſo many Vertues are the Poles upon
which that Immortal Frame is rolled? Laws
<pb facs="tcp:101520:8"/>
you have few and good; as Medicines, which
ſhould neither be many nor divers. Suing
at Law, which is very ſubject to abuſe, is
more reſtrained with you, then any where elſe
in the World; none are vexed with long Suits.
You have wonderful Concord one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
with which Cement your State holds;
and I have confidence will hold to the Worlds
end. Superiors manifeſt their Greatneſs
only in extending Favours; and Inferiors
without grudging, render Obedience, and
rejoyce in your <hi>Grandeur.</hi> Private quarrels
you paſs by for the Publick, benefit, and remit
offences in view of your Country. There is
no Contention but who ſhall love, that moſt

No where if ſo great a price ſet
upon faithful keeping of Counſel, Nor are
Secrets any where preſerved with ſuch ſtrict
ſilence; ſo that as other People have a great
itch of ſpreading reports, at <hi>Venice</hi> they
have unmovable affectation of holding their
peace; which is almoſt incredible in their
noble Youth, who condemn talking much, as
the companion of lying, by an inward prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of ſound judgment, and by the rules of
their Education. Whilſt Candidates, they ſtand
at the doors of the Court, and are admitted to
a ſight of the Publick Counſel, before a Voice
<pb facs="tcp:101520:8"/>
in it. From the firſt entrance of their Age,
they are by degrees uſed to their Honours,
which you ſharing equally, and judging of
Vertues, deprive none of their due; nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a colour of preferment, do you exhauſt the
worthy Pretendants in the Purchaſe. Such as
are advanced to Places of Honour, bring in
humility, not ſcornfulneſs; and as it proves
all the world over, find what they bring:
When private, you obey without Servility;
and when advanced, you command with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.
Young Men dive into the depths of
Prudence, becauſe they hearken to the Old;
concealing great Abilities, under an obſtinate
temperance of Words. Afterwards the avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of youth being caſt off, when they muſt
put on after glory; and being uſed to improve,
they find nothing strange or new. Ye are
covetous for the Publick Money, ſparing of
your own, which you do not get to ſcatter, but
to maintain your ſtate; In habit, not only
indifferent, but plain; you think it decent ſo
to diſcover the Modeſty of your minds. And
in truth, Silks and Gold Lace are not Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of brave Men, but Arguments of light

Servants doth not clamour after you. With
<hi>Athenian</hi> Severity you puniſh Luxury, which
plundering great Eſtates, ingenious to deſtroy
it ſelf, drives on furiouſly after its own Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
being withal the Bane of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths,
and Ruine of States. Thoſe that are
empty of ſolid goodneſs, gliſter in that bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
appearance, and bare of Worth ſpread
in Pomp, and ſumptuous Diſhes, rather exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
than ſatisfying the Appetite. How ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
is it, that you who are (upon more
accounts than one) Kings, ſhould condeſcend
in your whole Furniture to the plainneſs of
Fellow-Citizens, and ſhould ſhrowd the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Princes, as you all bear, under an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Garb. But that Majeſty which you
carry about every where, eſpecially by your
Ambaſſadors, who being Noble in Birth, do
every where repreſent the Dignity of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick,
hath its Source from your internal
Greatneſs, and is that Mother of the Honor and
Reverence due, and deferred to you; which
Glory accompanies, that inflames gallant
Souls, being peculiar to the immortal God, or
his immediate Repreſentatives, as you are.
All theſe things do adorn you, but the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
and <hi>Baſis</hi> of your State is Religion, by
which Subjects are made better, and more
peaceful. You have an ancient Doctrine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
<pb facs="tcp:101520:9"/>
in you, and received by Tradition
from your Anceſtors, that all our Enjoyments
are beſtowed upon us by God, and by him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to us. To believe this is commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but ſo as you believe it, that is, avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Irreligion and Superſtition, both of them
great miſchiefs. The inſultations over mens
weakneſs, which were prevalent in times of
Ignorance, are received by you only in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
who do not compel men to Faith
againſt their wills, but are of opinion, that a
right Judgment in Holy matters is inſinuated
by God into mens minds, and that the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which doth not proceed from the choice of
the heart, is unacceptable to God; but that
falſe Opinions are ſubdued by length of time,
not by the violence and commands of ſuch as
being choſen into the Sacred Miniſtry, do
exaſperate all things, and retain nothing of
that Office beſides the Name and Revenues.
You do not take theſe men into your Counſels,
being aware, that ſuch are for the moſt part
unſound at heart, and for audaciouſneſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable:
of no moderation, but dangerouſly
inquiſitive into the Deſigns of Princes, and
Secrets of State. Ye are indeed devout in
Religious Worſhip, but do preſcribe its Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
a meaſure of Church-Poſſeſſions. There is
a Prohibition in your Laws for the Augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:101520:10"/>
of Church-Livings without leave from the
Senate. For you think it an irreligious thing,
pious Liberalities ſhould be alienated, and the
laſt Wills of dying Perſons turned to ends, for
which they did not leave them. Between an
open neglect of Gods Service, and a ſlaviſh
fear of God, as between two Rocks, you ſail
happily. From hence flouriſhes among you
that unmoveable and ſtedfaſt Vprightneſs of
Juſtice in distributing every one his own,
without the trifling delays and captious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of the practice in corrupt Courts of
Judicature; by this means ſo many people are
united under equal Laws into your Empire and
Juriſdiction. This you ſuperadd to your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Cuſtoms; nothing among you is bought
and ſold. Publick Offices are the Rewards of
Vertue; and if there be any contrary inſtance,
it hath been introduced through the neceſſity
of hard times. Your moderate Revenues,
without crying up or down the price of money,
almoſt the higheſt and loweſt equally contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute.
The ſum growing from thence is not
conſumed and loſt before the true uſes are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
for which is was levied, by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Collectors, and by profuſe gratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
whilſt each do ſtop ſome as their own,
and give away more lightly, as being none of
their own. You cajol them to part with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb facs="tcp:101520:10"/>
money for great Occaſions, never constrain
them; which is a handſom ſleight in mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
matters. So that there are no complaints
in the caſe; or if there be, the Senate never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amines
them, having no inclination to convict
miſinformers. They neither hear the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers,
nor puniſh the accuſed; thinking it diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
to give ſatisfaction without occaſion:
and that it is only the part of a bad Prince to
force the Conſcience to Honesty. This is to be
attributed to your ſingular Policy, with which
as it were the Top of your Vertues, foreſeeing ſo
many imminent dangers, ye have driven off
the threatning Clouds; always Vmpires of
the diſagreeing World, courted even when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed;
and have in your Adverſities per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
that there is more relief to be had in
your Friendſhip, than in the ſpacious promiſes
of many Kings. And all this who would not
admire to be done with an Outlandiſh Army
and General. It is the Art of your Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to truſt Strangers, not an Evidence of
your own Valours, being decayed. How warily is
this provided? it appears, leſt any of your Own
puffed up with Martial Glory, ſhould aim at
that which heretofore confounded the <hi>Roman,</hi>
your parallel State, of which in other matters
you are cloſe Followers, eſpecially in inſtances
of Mercy. That was contented with one Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb facs="tcp:101520:11"/>
and that often empty: I lived with you
ſeven years, and ſaw but one poor Malefactor
executed, over whom the Judge groaned, and
cryed. No Prince loves to inflict more gentle
puniſhments, and this he doth honourably. For
it is not Majeſty whoſe Object is Dread, but
Cruelty; and nothing is more gallant for
Men in Dignity, than to grant pardon for
many things, to ask and need it for nothing.
We <hi>French</hi> had happy proof of this. For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
read or heard of ſo much meekneſs as we
have found. It is now above eighteen years
ago, ſince we have not ſeen the Sword drawn
but againſt Enemies amidſt ſo many provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of ſeverity. He that was ſupreme Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
among us, and that managed the Reins of
the Publick Fate, was ambitious rather to be
thought to have found us good, than to have
made us ſo. Thus did he ſeal the Publick
Peace with ſhedding no high Blood: nor was
he inſtrumental, that for ſecuring his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<hi>Executions</hi> of rich Delinquents ſhould
upon their Attainder be <hi>eſtreated</hi> into the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer.</hi>
By gentleneſs he ſhamed men into
Obedience: whereupon proſperous Fortune
did ſucceed all his Attempts to the Envy of the
aſtoniſhed World. This is he whoſe many Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories,
many good Services ye have often
heard of; but eſpecially in the bleſſed Aſpect of
<pb facs="tcp:101520:11"/>
this time, wherein the ſecurity of <hi>France,</hi> and
ſo many honourable Advantages are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to have been received from him
next under God; whom as the Top of your
Glory you have enrolled in the Liſt of ſo many
<hi>Heroes,</hi> whoſe Names mounted in the Chariot
of Fame and Honour, ſhall flye through the
remoteſt Regions: who have founded your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty

the Sea; who have made the <hi>Pelaſgi</hi> and

ſuch ſtubborn fighting, tributary to you. O

heat of Spirit allayed with no tincture of a

Fancy, I could not equalize in worthy ſort the
Honours of that excellent Nation, which being

            <p>HAving arrived at reſt of mind from many
dangers and troubles, I am reſolved to paſs
the reſidue of my days free from medling any more

as may poſſibly, the rather becauſe my mind
rallying againſt the inſults of Fortune, is now fully
ſet at liberty from hope and fear, and taking part
with any of the Princes. The retirement that I
had determined, could not appear under a more
fair pretext, nor did any ſubject occur either more
copious for acquiring praiſe, or more durable to
tranſmit to late memory; beſides that the work
appeared ſuitable to my Age now upon the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and ſome expectations and favourable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions

am not ignorant how odious it is, to repeat theſe

others by ſullen Truth which always goeth to
the quick, when it proceeds with uncorrupted
Faith and undaunted freedom of Speech.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſhall compriſe in this Decade with

            <p>1. After that <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. took <hi>Armand Richlien</hi>
for prime Miniſter of State, the Debates both of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101520:13"/>
Peace and War were carried on more fortunately
and with better faith. The name of <hi>Armand</hi> was
renowned all over <hi>Europe:</hi> all buſineſs applied to
him as Sharer in the Kingdom. He was the only
perſon in the eye of the City, of the Provinces, of
the Armies, not by ſecret workings but openly,
none contradicting. The better any ſtood affected
to him, he was the more advanced in Wealth and
Honours; and the moſt eminent, were the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeſt
to be at his devotion. All the world cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
never was ſuch a rare Creature, nor ever would
be again. Then were his Actions repeated in
particular.</p>
            <p>The cruſhing of the Rebels, the frighting <hi>Rochel</hi>
the Head-quarters of the Sectaries, chaining up the
Ocean, and the Kingdom ſetled: that by the relief of
<hi>Caſaille,</hi> reſtoring the D. of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> and bringing
the <hi>Savoyard</hi> to extremities, Laws were given to
<hi>Italy:</hi> that to the aſtoniſhment of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> he
had ridden in Triumph over the <hi>Alpes</hi> and <hi>Pyrenaean:</hi>
had eaſed the <hi>German</hi> Princes from the incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Empire, and broken the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi>
in many Parts. This was the Tamer of the <hi>Danube,</hi>
this of the <hi>Rhyne.</hi> The Pale of <hi>France</hi> was the Ocean,
and remoteſt Rivers. That the Armies, Provinces,
Fleets, all were compact within themſelves by his
means; that Juſtice was planted amongſt the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and awfulneſs umidſt the Confederates, the City
it ſelf was improved in ſtately Buildings, and enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
Somewhat indeed had been carried with a
high hand, but only to keep the reſt in quiet.</p>
            <p>All this was reported of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> and believed
by the World. But becauſe things arrived at the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101520:14"/>
higheſt pitch, do not long hold there, nor can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
ever ſupport it ſelf, he begun to ſink under
his own greatneſs. Then was death to have been
called for when by Providence it came: and by
Fate preventing the turn of Fortune, his laſt day ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated
the dangers that were imminent. A Fiſtula
in the Fundament preſented <hi>Armand</hi> this timely
d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th. To whoſe end before I come, it will not
be impertinent to premit a word or two.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lewis</hi> being grown weary of a Favourite that
lay ſo heavy upon him, had without doubt made
many and grievous complaints of the carriage and
pride of <hi>Richlieu.</hi> There was one <hi>Henry D'Effiat
de Cinque-Mars</hi> in great Vogue at Court for the
Kings ſpecial Favour, and certain Qualities reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
Vertues. He was obliging to his Friends
with his intereſt, and by relieving them with gifts:
towards ſtrangers too affable and courteous. He
had alſo advantages of Fortune in a graceful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.
But far from gravity of manners, or ſtaid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe.
He was airy and gallant, as is ordinarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
to that Age which had not yet arrived at
twenty two. Having therefore ſearched into the
Kings jealouſies of and diſtaſts againſt <hi>Richlieu,</hi> he
ſeveral times had an inclination to have made an
attempt upon him, whether unguarded, which was
rarely, or amidſt attendance, that were admirers of
ſuch a comely perſonage. Theſe thoughts ſpur'd
on his youthful mind, had not that which is the
bane of all great undertakings, a deſire of paſſing
unpuniſhed amidſt the ſweets of Vice, pulled him
back. And beſide he durſt not attempt that alone,
which ſome would cenſure for an hainous act, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101520:14"/>
thers would magnifie as an excellent ſervice. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he took in to his Counſel the Duke <hi>de Bouillon,</hi>
a perſon of an excellent Fame and temper of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
a mighty aid for ſo great a deſign: drew in <hi>de
Thou</hi> and others. In the firſt place, it was judged,
the ſafeſt way to truck with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> by the
concurrence of whoſe Arms the Party in <hi>France</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Richlieu</hi> begun greatly to advance; Now
when Affairs proved unſucceſsful, it was concluded
the King would ſoon forſake and throw off a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, ſufficiently diſguſted by him; and there was
no other means to ruine him ſafely. That <hi>Lewis</hi>
had ſo great an affection for his Kingdom, as that
he would never move him as long as his Eſtate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered
by his Service. This Intrigue was ſoon
diſcovered, either by the practices of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> or
becauſe the <hi>French</hi> can never keep Counſel, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to the King by <hi>Chavigny,</hi> a great Creature
of the Cardinals. At that time was the King
abroad at <hi>Narbo,</hi> whither he had travelled in very
ſtormy and rainy weather, it being but the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>February.</hi> The pretence was the Siege of
<hi>Perpignan,</hi> which <hi>Richlieu</hi> the prime Miniſter had
adviſed to get the King out of the way, and for
diverſion of the Enemy. Cloſe Guards being left
at <hi>Paris</hi> to watch the Queen and the young Princes.
This Plot then was diſcovered to His Majeſty, when
his Eminence not well in body, but worſe in mind
was upon his way homeward. The paſſage is
ſtrange, and ſcarce to be credited by the Readers,
that the King diſpleaſed with <hi>Richlieu,</hi> and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
affection towards <hi>D'Effiat,</hi> when once informed
that he held intelligence with die <hi>Spaniard,</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101520:15"/>
putting away all tenderneſs conſented to
the death of his ſpecial Favourite, ſuch influence
had either the love of his Kingdom, or the fear of
the Cardinal.</p>
            <p>Thereupon were <hi>Cinque-Mars</hi> the Grand Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable,
and <hi>de Thou</hi> late Maſter of Requeſts appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
at <hi>Narbo,</hi> the very day that the King had
but in the morning, embraced and kiſſed <hi>Cinque-Mars,</hi>
and had talked very courteouſly to <hi>de Thou:</hi>
having naturally that quality, and being practiſed
to diſguſt his anger under fine language. The King
being glad when the matter was over, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
till it was put in execution, parts from
<hi>Narbo.</hi> The ſame was done to <hi>de Bouillon</hi> at <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailles.</hi>
The Priſoners are brought to <hi>Lyons,</hi> where
by choſen Judges that were reſolved to do <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu</hi>'s
work before ever they heard the impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they are condemned to loſe their lives. <hi>De
Bouillon</hi> got off by the Surrender of <hi>Sedan, Cinque-Mars</hi>
and <hi>de thou</hi> pay dear for their deſtructive
friendſhip with the loſs of their lives. Whether
<hi>Cinque-Mars</hi> practiſed <hi>de Thou</hi> to draw him into
the Plot, or whether <hi>de Thou</hi> was contented enough
to be wrought upon, doth not appear. However
both were upon a Scaffold beheaded, with great
compaſſion of the Standers by, and lamentation of
all the Country. <hi>De Thou</hi> bore his condition not
ſtoutly, but with a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſenſe was long and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
at his prayers, which now might receive no
comfortable return. No Criminal hath been
known to ſuffer with more pity of the Beholders.
<hi>D'Effiat</hi> received his Fate reſolutely in the prime of
his Youth, by his own vertues and others vices run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101520:15"/>
headlong upon Fame. The King was then
onward in his Journey on the way to <hi>Paris, Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu</hi>
that was ever ſatisfied with puniſhment, never
with repentance, ordered the execution, and almoſt
looked on to ſee it done; and as if he took content
to hear their dying groans, was loth to depart from
<hi>Lyons,</hi> certified the King by Letter, that <hi>Perpignan
was taken, and his Enemies cut off.</hi> Which was an
unhandſom expreſſion. Reaſon indeed there is to
blame for ingratitude and indiscretion <hi>D'Effiat</hi>
eſpecially, who might eaſily have compaſſed by
time only, what he attempted with over-haſtineſs,
and by ill practices againſt the Laws both of God
and man. The two poor men are worthily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for being Traitors: but the principal
cauſe of their death was, becauſe they could not
brook with a ſlaviſh tameneſs to avow the fatal
baſeneſs of their Country. The one was Son to a
Mareſhal of <hi>France:</hi> The other received a great
addition to his ſplendor from <hi>James Auguſtus Thua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
our moſt eminent Hiſtorian, of an Illuſtrious
Family among thoſe of the long Robe, prime Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> a perſon renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
of great vertue, and by his ancient Linage al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
to many honourable Houſes of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richlieu,</hi> either haunted or ſtung in conſcience at
the remembrance of ſo many Executions, never
free from diſcontent, gives out that the tenderneſs
to his Country imported him beyond all private
affections. And now more like a Sceleton than
his Eminence, being carried upon the ſhoulders of
men, hath houſes broken down to make him room
to come in at, ſo much <hi>French</hi> blood loſt at home,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101520:16"/>
ſo much ſhed in the field diſquiets and dejects his
ſpirit now impriſoned in a languiſhing body. I
have but one requeſt to make the Readers of this
Story, that they would not ſuffer ſo many Noble
men executed to paſs off in oblivion, as though
they ſtole out from the Stage of the World. Let
Perſons of Honour challenge this Priviledge, that
as they are diſtinguiſhed from the Vulgar by their
Funerals, ſo they may receive, a peculiar memorial
in recording their fall, I mean the <hi>Vendoſmes,</hi> the
<hi>Ornani,</hi> the <hi>Marillaes,</hi> the <hi>Montmorancies,</hi> upon
whom I judge it beſt not to dilate the <hi>Cramaillaes,</hi>
the <hi>Baſſompeirres,</hi> the <hi>Viſtries,</hi> the <hi>Chaſtelneufs,</hi> with
innumerable others baſely impriſoned.</p>
            <p>At length this ſcarcely breathing Corps, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
benefited by the Waters of <hi>Borbogne,</hi> is brought
to <hi>Paris,</hi> carrying about it the incentive of its own
pain in a ſpirit more exulcerated than the body.
Many marks of exaſperation, formerly ſmothered,
then burſt out. Diſtruſt of the King: a deſire to
remove ſuch as were not Confidents: impoſing
upon his Maſters ear by <hi>Chavigny,</hi> growing daily
fierce through an habitual and implanted arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
whilſt <hi>Lewis</hi> ſuſpected <hi>Armand, Armand</hi> did no
leſs ſuſpect <hi>Lewis.</hi> A matter of Scandal!</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Richlien</hi>'s diſtemper grew up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him. Many diſcourſed of the benefits of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
The greateſt number paſt their cenſure who
were likely to ſucceed in favour: all called for
Peace; cryed out againſt Wars which had been
commenced againſt the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> not ſo
much out of deſire to enlarge the Empire, or upon
any conſiderable expectation, as for the eſtabliſhing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101520:16"/>
the power of <hi>Richlieu.</hi> Some few days before his
laſt, His Majeſty came to Town to viſit the ſick
Cardinal. Many tears paſt on both ſides, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
of affection. The King thought it his beſt
courſe to lay aſide his diſpleaſure, and not to grate
the memory of a dying man with any diſguſtful
words. Therefore during the whole time of his
ſickneſs, he viſited him by Meſſengers oftner than
Kings are wont, and ſent to him his principal Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians; were it out of care, or to obſerve his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
The laſt day frequent intelligence was
brought of his declining. No body imagining he
would be ſo curious to enquire, what he ſhould be
ſorry to hear, yet His Majeſty put on his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
an appearance of ſadneſs, when he was ſure
that his grudge was ſatisfied: and conceiving he
might now be ſafely kind, conſtrained himſelf to
let fall a tear, and forced groans from a joyful
breaſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Armand du Pleſſis Richlieu</hi> was born at <hi>Paris,</hi> of
a noble and untainted Extraction; his Father was
<hi>Francis du Pleſſis,</hi> his Mother <hi>Suſanne du Port;</hi> he
had a fair Eſtate which he waſted. Firſt an Abbot,
afterwards Biſhop. No excellent Preacher, having
fed upon the Chimaera's of the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the more polite Learning, while the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſ
<hi>d'Ancres</hi> was in favour, Secretary to the Queen
Mother. Then confin'd to <hi>Avignon.</hi> Recalled
from thence by her means, was made prime Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of State. Shortly after the poor Lady found
her favours over-haſtily heaped upon him; for ſhe
being by his means chaſed out of the Kingdom, an
Exile, having wandered thorow <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:101520:17"/>
without any certain abode, at length in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne,</hi>
broken with afflictious, changed an unhappy
life for a deſirable death. But this by the way.
To return to <hi>Richlieu,</hi> whole ſhape, if Poſterity
ſhall be ſo curious as to enquire, was comely and
tall; nor wanted he gravity tempered with a
graceful aſpect. He lived 57 years: was in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
18. Having paſſed a middle age, in reſpect
of glory, and eternal fame may be judged to have
run the longeſt period of life. For he had obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
whatever could be wiſhed for. What could
Fortune heap upon one ſo ſucccſsful and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed?
What was more bleſſed than for him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
in Honour, flouriſhing in Fame, to ſecure
future Events, ſeeing that nothing in Nature is ſo
fickle as Power that depends upon anothers plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure?</p>
            <p>After the deceaſe of <hi>Richlieu</hi> the Cabinet-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to the King were Cardinal <hi>Julius Mazarine,</hi> a
Roman by birth, <hi>Leo Bouthillier Chavigny</hi> and <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet
Noyer</hi> both Secretaries of State. This Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virate
did not agree. Some courting by ſecret ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
the Queen, others Monſieur, others the
<hi>Dauphin,</hi> as the riſing Sun.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soublet</hi> a paſſionate man, ſomewhat fierce, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
the Jeſuitical Poſition, that vertue requires
no other reward but that of a good conſcience,
which ſets a generous luſtre upon actions, under
that veil diſguiſed his ambition: a man of blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
conversation; for wiſdom and judiciouſneſs
but indifferent, having ſuch an eſtate, as he did not
increaſe by any unworthy practices, though he
wanted not opportunities to have done it, in that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101520:17"/>
point highly to be commended that he made not
uſe of them. Greatly in <hi>Richlieu</hi>'s favour for his
obſervance and induſtry; one that ſo reſpected his
friends in proſperity, as never to forſake them when
they declined.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leo Bouthillier</hi> had contracted pride from <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu,</hi>
whoſe ſupport now failing, he thought it more
ſeaſable to get into be the ſecond, than to aim at
the prime Miniſtry. Therefore did he put <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>
forward, but ſo as himſelf a while to paſs for
his equal, not as acting under him afterwards
would have ſupplanted him; of which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mazarine</hi> whether by Fate or ſome peculiar Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
won upon Inferiors, upon Equals, upon Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors,
by variety of applications. He had a
comely Perſonage, but was moſt renowned for an
acute and ſubtile wit, for experience in buſineſs, for
vaſt deſigns, and equal ſucceſſes; one who never
gave Counſel, or laid Plot that did not prove effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual.
To this was joyned ſuch a diſcreetneſs of
carriage, that though he had got above many, he
was equally dear to all, charming envy by an Art
of converſation. From theſe and ſuch like qualities
it was evident to ſuch as can skill the Court, that
he was the one man that muſt ſhortly carry all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him. Nor did it prove otherwiſe. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
imployed in the managing our State, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
almoſt all <hi>Europe,</hi> he brought thoſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes
to paſs, which this day put the whole
World in admiration.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty now wholly intending Peace, had
reſolved to ſend Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> his Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101520:18"/>
to the Treaty of <hi>Munſter,</hi> whereof I ſhall ſpeak
afterwards: but altering his mind. thought it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to uſe him as his prime Miniſter. Then firſt of
all was <hi>Mazarine</hi> had in open Honour among us
by being admitted to be God-father to the <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin,</hi>
whom he named <hi>Lewis</hi> that is now the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth,
who ſhall be the Theme and Subject of our
Work.</p>
            <p>About this time the King falls ſick at S. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains.</hi>
Prayers are made for his recovery. The
Princes, the Nobility, and Commons attend the
Iſſue of his weakneſs. He being ſollicitous at the
approach of death, had many debates in his mind,
He thought it unſafe to truſt the Queen with the
Government, (Madam <hi>Cheureuſe,</hi> which was her
great Confident, then kept in <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſecret In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
by Letters paſſing between them, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
his Majeſty) To Monſieur he was never
truly reconciled. Therefore it is reſolved to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the Government to neither: but that ten Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
be choſen to bridle both their powers. At
length His Majeſties Will is made and ſealed.</p>
            <p>Each preſently ſtrive to inſinuate themſelves into
the Queens favour by divers practices, eſpecially
<hi>Noyer</hi> that aſſumed to himſelf the glory of making
the Will. He is ſupplanted by <hi>Chavigny,</hi> quits the
Court, and asks leave to retire: ſoon after pines
and frets himſelf to death; no Rules of Wiſdom
ſufficing to ſtill or ſuſtain his Spirit. <hi>Chavigny</hi>
ſtayed behind but as a ſhadow or empty appearance
of buſineſs, <hi>Mazarine</hi> leaving no means unaſſay'd,
got the ſole Management. Which Prize having
obtained, after much deliberation, having carefully
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101520:18"/>
weighed his own and his Competitors intereſts, he
let ſlip no kind of deference poſſible towards any,
either in publick or private. All came in, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
the Biſhop of <hi>Beauvais, Beaufort,</hi> and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
<hi>Cheureuſe</hi> now returned to the French Court,
that were afterwards turned all out of Favour, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been the Contrivers of their own diſgrace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Majeſty ſometimes a little cheered, then anon
ſpent, when his death approached, ſpoke to the
Queen, ſupported by her two Sons, and the Nobles
ſtanding by him, much to this purpoſe.</hi> Seeing
that decay of Nature doth now bring my life to an
end, I haſte the few words that I am to ſpeak will be
the more ſacred with you, the nearer I am entring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thoſe places of which Divines ſpeak ſuch glorious
things. By this right hand which this day lays down
the Scepter and tranſmits it to this your King (<hi>point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at his Son and Heir</hi>) I adviſe and adjure you ever
to pay him unſpotted Loyalty. Reverence him, and
do your diligence that ſuch a proſperous State may
not be impaired by my untimely death, and his tender
age. I leave you a Kingdom firm and flouriſhing, and
unleſs it offer, violence to it ſelf by Civil diſſenſions,
that can never come to other ruine. Not Armies, nor
Treasures are the Pillars of this Empire, but Counſel
and Concord.</p>
            <p>More he ſaid, which having been then publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I forbear to transcribe hither. Looking upon
<hi>Conde, Your Son</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>hath won a brave Battel</hi>
Now the D. <hi>d'Enguien</hi> was General in the Borders
of <hi>Champaigne,</hi> and a little while after gave the
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> laying an untimely Siege to <hi>Rocroy,</hi> a
great Defeat; and having raiſed the Siege, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101520:19"/>
them chaſe, went far up into their Country,
and laid it waſte. This glimpſe the King gave,
before he expired, rather after a prophetical ſort,
then that he was not perfect in his ſenſes. He
ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly adviſed <hi>Gaſton</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to amend his
life. Turning to the Duke of <hi>Engouleſmes</hi> ſaid, that
<hi>All things leaning only upon pleaſure. are but fading;
and repentance would follow ſpeedily, or more late.</hi>
Many other excellent ſayings he uttered according
to the Chriſtian Doctrine of the Hope of a better
life, and ſuch ſweet Conſolations of Mortality that
is very loth to think of coming to an end; which
being ſo often thundered out in Pulpits, I here
wave. No mortal man, either ancient or late, did
ſo couragiouſly receive the aſſault of death.</p>
            <p>At length <hi>May</hi> 15. 1643. he dyed an eaſie
death. Lamented by ſome of his intimate friends,
but worthy to have been followed with a larger
mourning of all <hi>French-men,</hi> had he choſen to act
by himſelf what he could well have done, rather
than by Colleagues to whom he was all his life time
obnoxious, to his own and Countries great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.
He was ſingularly courteous to all about
him. Free from pride, yet retained Majeſty and
Gallantry of Spirit. Moderate in pleaſures; entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
loving his Kingdom: and had he been allowed
a longer ſpace of life, would have proved the beſt of
Kings. Many obſerved that which perhaps is of
no great importance, that the ſame day he came to
the Empire, was the laſt of his life; for his Father
<hi>Henry</hi> was murdered on the very ſame day of <hi>May.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The Princes and Nobles came all up to
Town: and none made a greater ſhew of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101520:19"/>
than they that were moſt glad at it. His Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
were performed in ſuch order as is proper for
Kings: and the expoſing in State being over, his
Corps is interred amongſt his Predeceſſors at S. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>
without any pomp, or but very little. Such
directions had he given when he ordered concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Burial.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Lewis</hi> was dead, every one begun to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſerious thoughts of his own eſtate. I judge it
therefore ſeaſonable, before I compile the intended
ſtory, to declare how the Princes, the Parliament,
the Eccleſiaſticks, the Provinces, the Armies ſtood
affected; what were the Bounds of the Empire;
how firm the Allies; and in ſum, what was the
ſtate of our Affairs; what Parts in the Government
were ſtrong, what again weak; So that not only
the Products and Events of Actions, which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
are but contingent, but the reaſon too and
cauſes of them may be known.</p>
            <p>The Death of <hi>Lewis,</hi> as it was joyfully taken at
the firſt heat by thoſe that were tranſported with it,
ſo did it ſtir up divers thoughts and affections not
only in the City and Parliament, but likewiſe in the
Provinces, and amidſt the Armies and Officers.
The Followers and Friends of the Baniſhed and
Impriſoned begun to hold up their heads. The
King towards his later days, whether ſtung in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
or to throw an <hi>Odium</hi> upon <hi>Richlieu,</hi> and
that he might lay at his door the cruelty of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
had recalled the Baniſhed, and releaſe
thoſe that had long lain in priſon.</p>
            <p>3. The Princes of the Blood were joyful, as is
uſual upon change of Government, reſuming pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101520:20"/>
their liberty with intention to uſe their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
more licentiouſly, as having to do with, a King
but five years old, a Spaniſh Woman, and <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>
an Italian. For the Biſhop of <hi>Beauvais</hi> did
not long continue in favour, as one inſufficient to
draw in ſuch a yoke, as his Rivals would make
believe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gaſton</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> the Kings Uncle, who
had neither love, nor hatred, but as they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt:
all his life time ſubject to the Tuition of his
Counſellors, did at that time lead a life free
from cares under the Conduct of the Abbot of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieres,</hi>
whoſe Counſels tending to Peace, he did not
always follow to his own great damage. Then
ſpent he his days in jollity, his nights in dancing,
and drew money to bear theſe expences out of the
Exchequer, which as long as it ſtood open to him,
he never troubled himſelf about the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conde</hi> was a profound Politician. He had a
ſtrange Art of living. Men coming new from the
Plough, or Ship-broad, might find him neither
ſtately nor guarded, and he would freely confer
with them. He was open to all, and enquired into
every thing, know every thing. He minded all
affairs great and ſmall; and ſo by theſe ways, more
than the claſhing of Arms, raiſed his Eſtate to vaſt
Wealth, which he was the firſt <hi>Conde</hi> that every cared
to heap up, and in that being very conſiderable
and abounding, deſired that nothing but the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Kingdom, and the Publick Welfare
with his private Gains.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Enguien</hi> his Son leaving all care either of State or
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101520:20"/>
Family to his Father, then only affected Martial
Glory. And at that age a ſucceſsful daring had in
him the place of Valour: but when his parts attain
to maturity, he ſhall come to the higheſt pitch of
perfection. What he came afterwards to be, the
order of the Story will inform. His Brother <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>newly</hi>
come from School, did ſcarce write man, of
an excellent diſpoſition, which afterwards inclined
to Religion, not that which conſiſts in diſputing,
but in living, having the ſap of good works: in
ſeriouſneſs; not out of oſtentation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Longueville</hi> Son in Law to <hi>Conde</hi> ſailed in <hi>Condes</hi>
Bottom, yet would meddle with all, but favoured
none, ſave the ſtrongeſt Party: if they came to be
low, would ſlip his neck out of the Collar. After
the Kings death, he had propoſed to get all the
ſtrong Holds in <hi>Normandy</hi> under his Power, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<hi>Havre de Grace;</hi> that ſo ſecured againſt the
<hi>Normans,</hi> ſecured againſt the King, he might play
<hi>Rex</hi> in that Port.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vendoſme</hi> the natural Son of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. by <hi>Gabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elle
d'Eſtres,</hi> having his Eſtate conſumed by ſo long
adverſities, ſolaced his mind grown ſavage by ſuch
continued Exile, either with the ſingle remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of his former Fortune, or with the hopes of
a better: nor did he plot any thing elſe, but how
by all poſſible means to repair the Breaches of his
decayed Family. The Duke de <hi>Mercoeur,</hi> his eldeſt
Son lived in quiet. <hi>Beaufort</hi> his younger, did up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his own head prepare himſelf a way to the
prime Miniſtry, for which attempt he afterwards
was impriſoned, beſides that he had ſomewhat to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o with <hi>Mombazon.</hi> I am certainly informed,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101520:21"/>
that his late Majeſty before his death, did very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
recommend theſe Youths to the Queen.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> reſembling his Anceſtors in
Courage and Gallantry (with different ſucceſs)
came not up; but ſacrificed his time in the <hi>Low-Countries</hi>
upon courting and following his <hi>Amours</hi>
to the expence of Reputation. The two younger
Brothers inherited the popularity inherent to their
Anceſtors. At this juncture of Affairs, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Progeny of ſo many Heroes, that heretofore
durſt try for the Kingdom by Arms, now finds not
place for ſo much as a wiſh, pretending to nothing
more at this time than a thing very eaſie to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs,
that is, not to ſtir.</p>
            <p>A Branch of the Houſe of the <hi>Guiſes, Elboeuf</hi> and
<hi>Harcourt</hi> depreſſed in their Eſtates, had no deſigns.
This latter a ſtout and daring Souldier, afterwards
toſſed in variety of Fortunes: about whom I ſhall
have occaſion hereafter to ſpeak not a little.</p>
            <p>Thoſe of <hi>Nemours</hi> made <hi>French</hi> from a <hi>Savoy</hi>
ſtock, of a numerous male Line were but two left;
the Elder of which had a great ſpirit in a ſmall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
but his thred of life being ſoon cut off, left his
Brother Succeſſor, who held nothing of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Houſe but their blameleſs manners. Such
were our Princes, not any either willing or able to
work an Alteration. All of them ſubſcribed to the
preſent Government, beating their heads about
many things to no effect. This is the Quality of
the <hi>French,</hi> eſpecially Courtier, to make much ſtir
that preſently vaniſhes in the air. To bind one
another in deceitful bonds, afterwards to flye off,
and betray one another. A Crafts Maſter will eaſily
break through ſuch Cobwels.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:101520:21"/>
4. Now the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> they do not
diſlike the preſent State. This is a great Body
compounded of divers Humors. At a certain ſum
of money (which is undecent) they purchaſe this
Degree, <hi>For themſelves and their Heirs.</hi> Moſt of
them live above their Eſtates, and having waſted
their means, either by their Wives, or their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens,
or their own prodigality long after a
Change. Their Office, if the matter be lightly
ſcann'd, is <hi>to preſerve every mans propriety, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
differences, to mitigate the increaſe of Taxes, and
retrench ways of Oppreſſion that have been invented
more grievous than Taxes; to encourage Trade: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all, to advance the Kings Honour; to teach the
people that by their own good example; never to claſh
with nor diſpute the Kings Commands: but humbly
petition him; and hold the Princes Will for the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Law.</hi> This ought to be the Temper of the
Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> which hath been heretofore
the Rule of Right, the Bound of Equity, and the
Pillar of Law: to which, as to an Oracle, all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
came from every part to be reſolved: but, as
all things grow worſe by length of time, ſo is that
fallen from its ancient Glory. I ſpeak of the moſt,
not of all. For that Court even to this day, can
produce brave men, who maintaining their State
with integrity, do bear up that tottering Fabrick:
and who being carried away with the ſtream of the
Seditious, have groaned over their own Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
That purple Aſſembly hath and will yet add
great weight to the Kings not only Decrees, but
Actions alſo. Therefore after the deceaſe of <hi>Lewis,</hi>
it was ſtrictly obſerved which way the Scale would
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101520:22"/>
turn. By the conſent of <hi>Orleans, Conde,</hi> and the
Parliament the whole Government was committed
to the Queen under the name of Regent. Then
was it not objected againſt <hi>Mazarine</hi> his being an
Alien. Nay ſoon after he is counted worthy to be
choſen, and that with the Applauſe of the Senate
for the man to whom the Hopes and Helm of the
Kingdom ſhould be intruſted, that the Competition
among the Princes might by that expedient be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.
This the Soul of <hi>Lewis</hi> now in Heaven

            <p>5. <hi>Mazarine</hi> caſting with himſelf what is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and what profitable, paſt this Sentence upon the
Clergy: Theſe are his words counſelling the Queen
Regent. <hi>The Sacred Order for theſe many years
hath had but a thin harveſt of excellent Perſons, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it come to paſs. Men follow after nice Queſtions,
live idly, do not embrace ſerious Studies. All is
done with Pomp, nay if any Sermons be to be made,
and the very venerable Sacrifice offered. Of their
Office they lay claim to nothing, but their Rents: the
Duty of Preaching, which is the principal Dignity of
a Biſhop, they quit to any one, though never ſo inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.
They think themſelves Biſhop enough, if they
can but ride in fine Coaches, with their Arms ſet on,
outvy one another in rich Liveries and Lacquais; and
puniſh with rigour thoſe that tranſgreſs in the leaſt
matters. Perpetual Haunters of Ladies Couches, not
without undervaluing the Paſtoral Staff. This is for
the moſt part, for there are ſome that lead holy and
unreproveable lives; He that ſhall take offence, will

So much power hath Religion over the minds of men,
that as often as amongſt men in holy Orders any eminent
Vertue hath got up, and overcome the common attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and the vices of mankind, it is adored like a
Deity. At that time that Company was of no weight
nor moment in France, ſaid Mazarine</hi> I am trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and in a manner unwilling to write this; but
plain dealing and faithfulneſs doth at preſent of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
thoſe that it meets with, afterwards it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
and commended.</p>
            <p>There was <hi>Francis Paul Gondy,</hi> by Extraction a
<hi>Florentine,</hi> but born in <hi>France,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Rhetz,</hi>
afterwards Coadjutor to the Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Corinth;</hi> one that, if occaſion had offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
would have aſpired high, as Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi>
confeſſed he was perſwaded. Over and above an
honourable Family, he had Eloquence and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with promptneſs of Spirit. Very free of other
mens money; not careful to pay his debts, though
his Creditors were in the greateſt neceſſities, but
rather forward to beſtow courteſies. He regarded
more to engage many, than to ſeek that any ſhould
make him requital; of a lofty mind: had many
deſigns in his head: catching at opportunities,
waited for ſome alteration only to advance his
Honour.</p>
            <p>6. The Provinces being waſted, torn, and haraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with Taxes, Impoſitions, and Free-Quarters,
cryed out for nothing elſe but Peace; yet in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs
to couch under greater burdens. So great is
their Obedience and Loyalty to their Soveraign.
Their Governors were men engaged, that would
hear the yoke quietly. There were then no <hi>Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morencies</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:101520:23"/>
nor <hi>Les Diguieres,</hi> which heretofore at
their leaſt motion, would make the Court ſhake.
That <hi>Rohan</hi> who for fourteen years together trod
upon the Bowels of the State, to maintain by Arms
the new Profeſſion, was long ſince gone out of the
world, and had left none behind him that could
anſwer the reputation of ſuch a mighty Name.</p>
            <p>The Innovators (for that name I ſhall uſe) wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with Wars, their Head being taken off at the
winning of <hi>Rochel,</hi> the Seat of the Rebellion, pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
after nothing but to be at quiet; which is
wonderful at that change. And becauſe that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion

<hi>Calvin</hi> ſet up Rites contrary to the Divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and as a principal Doctrine inſtilled into his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101520:23"/>
Followers, that the ſanctifying Wafer, the ſacred
Bread is not turned into Chriſt by the muttering of the
Prieſt, which I tremble to mention: the ſupreme object
of their Worſhip is not kneaded by the Bakers hands,
nor changeable, nor ſubject to corruption; they vilifie
the Sacrifice of the Maſs, and Prayers for the Dead.
That there is a Heaven and Hell: they are perſwaded
but not at all that there is a Purgatory. That
the Pope cannot make Saints, and as to them, that
Heaven is never the fuller. They give the Virgin but
little honour: and only ſuch as is far leſs than her
Sons. Prayer, they ſay, is not to be made to her.
Reliques and dead Bones of Saints they make a jeſt of.
Indulgences for buying of ſins at a certain ſum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to be paid: they ſlight and confidently affirm men
might imploy their money better. The Pope they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe,
as a meer Phantoſm and empty appearance: do
not dread his Bulls the Vatican Thunder-bolts: affirm
it to be a Sword whoſe edge conſiſts in bare imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
To empty the ſink of ſin into the cars of the
Prieſt, they take for a principal argument of a weak
underſtanding. The load of Confeſſion, they call a
Pack of Humane Conſtitutions. To diſpleaſe ones ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
with fiſh and dry meats in <hi>Lent,</hi> Phrenſie; as
alſo empty ones ſelf with mortifying Faſts at that
time, becauſe no leaf in the Old or New Teſtament en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns
it. And when the year renews, and the floating
humors begin again to work, then to be tyrannized
over two whole months, and the youth of the year to be
clouded with ſadneſs, and when Nature deſigns this
that our bodies being purged from unwholeſom hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,
ſhould be repleniſhed with new juyces, that to
have them corrupted with meer putrefactions, and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

meats, and that by the doting of them, who touch no
ſuch things themſelves, but enjoyn ſolemn Faſts, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly
abſtaining. This they ſay of our <hi>Lent.</hi> In
other things always pretend the Bible, quote Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures;
in Diſputes tire our ſtrongeſt, diſſatisfie thoſe
of middle parts, catch not a few. Their Teachers
they call Miniſters, not diſtinguiſhed in habit from the
Laity. And becauſe they have like paſſions as other
men, they allow them to marry wives of their own,
counting that better than for them to corrupt other
mens; which they malignantly charge upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married
and chaſt Order. Their Temples are naked
and cenſed with Prayers. They have their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
with a cruſt of Bread, and ſip of Wine on certain
days in memory of the Lords Supper. That God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a pure Spirit, is to be worſhipped with a pure ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
not with Beads, which they call in deriſion the
Serpents eggs. They diſlike Monaſteries where, they
ſay, innumerable happy Wits are unhappily ſtifled and
buried alive, which might have been choſen Veſſels of
the Lord, had they with judgment taken to a courſe
agreeable to their nature: thus they ſpeak. <hi>Geneva</hi>
the Head of the Religion, a City of the <hi>Allobroges,</hi>
was under the Government of their own Biſhops, but
hath now flung off their yoke, and continues as yet a
free State. Vnder the Walls the <hi>Rhoſne</hi> runs free,
and with its own waters through the <hi>Lacus Lema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
A Lake of a vaſt compaſs, like a Sea roars and
raiſes billows. The City is ſituate on high, and
ſtrengthned with Works and Banks. The Walls take
in two Hills, artificially bending or winding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
of a pleaſant proſpect, and delightful to the
Beholders. In that place men and women are alike
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101520:24"/>
obſtinate, and all do conſtrue that they have ſo great
aſſurance of God, that they do not turn to truth even in
adverſity, as if ſo be they ſhould be forced to receive the
Catholicks, they would ſtand more in fear of life than
death.</p>
            <p>I have ſomewhat the more largely diſcourſed
about that Sect, becauſe an opportunity hath offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and no others did more largely contribute
heretofore to the Rebellion: by the Example of
<hi>Tacitus</hi> that digreſſes ſomewhat freely in the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of the <hi>Jews:</hi> but eſpecially of <hi>Polybius,</hi> who
being a chief Maſter in theſe caſes ſlackens the reins
of Hiſtory with far greater digreſſions. There is
no more certain Argument of ignorance and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhneſs,
than to refuſe knowledge, and aſſume an
ability of Judgment after ſuch eminent men.</p>
            <p>Therefore that Party which had ſo often been
prevalent to the ruine of <hi>France,</hi> after the death of
<hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. either ſubdued, or quiet of themſelves,
gave no diſturbance, although they had reaſon to
be proud of <hi>Thurenne</hi> and <hi>Gaſſion,</hi> being brave men
both of whom had a worthy Name, but with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>The former would wiſely pitch upon the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of ground; often gain a Victory without
blood or mourning. Curb the Enemy, by delay
ſeldom venturing a Battel, with good advice for
Peace or War by conduct and providence, inſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of glory; and ingroſſing to himſelf all the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
of the Battel, would ſecretly charge upon his
Fellow-Officers all the errours or misfortunes,
would protract Wars out of Art, or deſign of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
long in Commiſſion. Having a natural
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101520:25"/>
pride of his Nobility; comparable to ancient Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,

<hi>Portugal</hi> torn from <hi>Spain,</hi> depended on the looks of

            <p>Our Nobles, all of them wholly ſet upon what

to think themſelves dull and negligent of

Prince, from whom they think they are to draw as
from a Torrent that will not always run; eſpecially
by reaſon of the Miniſters foreignneſs, which they
were confidently perſwaded they might eaſily baffle.
Even many private perſons were craving. <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>
granted every one that for which he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned,
and ſpared for no coſt, ſo he might but
render them engaged and faithful to the Queen:
won whomſoever he could at that time, by gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.
In the mean while the poor Exchequer
was pillag'd by Court-Leeches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mazarine</hi> foreſaw much, that time would be
when the heaping up of money would occaſion
miſchief. Nothing at that time did ſo much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
his thoughts. The ſafety and Honour of the
Kingdom he deſired; could not attain this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Arms, nor Arms without pay; nor pay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Taxes, nor Taxes without vexation, nor vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
long without complaints, in a State condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every thing, and to be feared for its exceſs:
that is not to be ſatisfied but by ill practices, which
draw dangerous conſequences. Proſperity had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101520:26"/>
debauched their minds: Wealth was in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
poverty accounted a reproach. After Riches
Luxury, and Covetouſneſs its attendants, with
pride had broke in: they tore, they waſted, they
built Houſes and Villa's like Cities. What ſhould
I go on to mention that which will be ſcarce credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to poſterity? They ſo far abuſed their ill gotten
riches, that very many Receivers, (Partiſans they
call them) the Wens of Mankind, have levelled
Mountains, and raiſed Plains to Mountains, have
built them houſes, with which for habitation may
compare neither Kings nor Emperors. To furniſh
their Table, they ſearch all that may be got by Sea
or Land. They purchaſe luxury by gains, Rapines
by luxury: and it is their higheſt value for an
Eſtate, to laviſh an Eſtate. Hereupon when their
means fail, they ſet upon Change of Government,
to get more to ſpend. It was ordinarily pleaded,
<hi>That by the increaſe of the Kingdom private mens
Eſtates were come to fuller growth. That money is
now at another rate than heretofore in the Kingdom,
when ſmall, where the houſes were but little; That
nothing is over-much, where is power; all things
are to anſwer the Poſſeſſors fortune.</hi> A confeſſion of
Vices, and the likeneſs of Delinquents eaſily was
conſented to under plauſible names.</p>
            <p>10. <hi>Thus was it in</hi> the City fruitful for engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
miſchiefs, and that is of ſo great moment, that
whitherſoever it lean, thither do all things in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
bend; becauſe in it the ſtrength and hopes of the
whole Kingdom are placed; and becauſe the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
divides from them all abroad. It diſpenſeth to
all the Provinces, Officers intruſted with Arms and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101520:27"/>
Laws: it receives into its boſom all ſorts of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:
and cheriſheth mankind upon a commonty, not
like a Dame, but Mother, whom it receives, it calls
Denizens; and obligeth to it ſelf in a bond of natural
affection thoſe that are in the remote parts of the
world. Let not ancient <hi>Rome</hi> compare her ſelf, nor
all the Illuſtrious Cities in the Eaſt. It will iſſue out
four Cities without any loſs of the people exhauſted, it
will ſet out 100000 Souldiers: and yet the ſtreets
cram'd. It will nobly entertain four Kings coming on
a ſudden; and the Citizens have plenty, being cut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

            <p>Preſently upon the death of <hi>Lewis,</hi> it was quiet

            <p>
               <hi>Mazarine</hi> was unable to ſatisfie ſo many luſts,
the Treaſury being almoſt already drawn dry.
Every one thinks himſelf conſiderable for buſineſs:
and thereafter expects wages, gaping after reward:
hence iſſue out Spies and Trapans, the main concern
of whoſe life is to know and to be unknown, that
Gang of Informers ſwarms in teachy times: a
Tribe inſatiable, ſubtle, falſe, that will at all times
condemn, and at the ſame times will be cheriſhed.
<hi>Orleans, Conde, Mazarine, Longueville, Seguier,
Bryenne, Bouthillier, Chauvigny,</hi> his Son, and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vienne</hi>
went for the Counſel of State: But at that
very time Fame gave out that <hi>Mazarine</hi> was all in
all, the reſt but ſhadows, that went along with
him, and moved at his motions; for the Queen
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101520:27"/>
concluded with him all matters of importance, as
with her only Cabinet-Counſellor: the reſt taken
to ſit at the board for Pomps ſake, that they might
debate things reſolved before-hand, and might
pleaſe themſelves with an empty appearance of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
And to ſay the truth, <hi>Mazarine</hi> did
then openly preſent <hi>Richlieu</hi> riſen from the dead.
Which two, becauſe ſo lucky an occaſion is offered,
I have not thought fit to paſs over, without decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Nature and Qualities of both, as far as
my weak parts can reach.</p>
            <p>11. In the much that I have read, and have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
it is evident from the firſt foundations of the
Kingdom to theſe preſent times, that the excellent
vertue of a few have done all the great Actions.
Among them two perſons have been moſt eminent
for their tranſcendent merits, <hi>Armand Richlieu,</hi> and
this our <hi>Julius Mazarine,</hi> differing in qualities, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
in Country: both of the ſame rank in the
Church, both of Illuſtrious Extraction. Their
Age, Eloquence were alike, Courage equal; alſo
their Glory: but other advantages each had to
himſelf in particular. <hi>Armand</hi> was accounted great
for his magnificent Works: <hi>Julius</hi> ſurpaſſed him
in ſplendour of life. The formers ſeverity made
him awful: The latters gentleneſs and mercy made
him renowned. <hi>Richlieu</hi> by laviſhing and by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing;
<hi>Mazarine</hi> by pardoning and wary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing
obtained glory. The ones eaſie and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
bounty was commended: The others ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in giving was condemned. Thoſe that offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Richlieu</hi> were certain to be deſtroyed: <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines</hi>
Enemies took Sanctuary in <hi>Mazarine</hi> himſelf.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101520:28"/>
That other carried all with a high hand: This
with an imperious ſtilneſs; that was well verſed in
the <hi>French</hi> Kingdom: This acquainted with the
States of the World. That dyed in the heat of
Wars, uncertain of events. This after peace ſetled
ſecure of ſucceſs. That to the joy of his King;
this, while his King wept over him, expired in his
Arms. However the Relation contained in this
Book is neceſſary, and as I hope not ungrateful, that
What perſons the Reader is to ſee engaged with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety

            <p>For whereas all Hiſtory conſiſts of Men and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
I have judged it fit, more to inſiſt upon
them than theſe; becauſe it hath more influence
upon humane life in reference to the example, for
one to know what were the ſeveral diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of men, than for heads to be filled with inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant
Stories. The principal matter is, to be read
in men. Fortune having taken much away from
me, hath left me the converſation of the <hi>French</hi>
Natures, which I do here in a manner limbe. This
in truth is more profitable than to be informed of
bare particular occurrents. I compoſe and write
what another Age will read. Our own diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it ſelf, as having left off to do commendable
Actions, thinks it impertinent to be praiſed or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſed,
and defies Images, becauſe it dreads them.
As to <hi>Mazarine,</hi> I ſpeak not of his Fortune, but of
himſelf; who was known to me not for any obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
but many wrongs, that I received from
him; ſince my whole family is beholding to him
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101520:28"/>
ſingly for its calamities. Nevertheleſs ſuch is the
power of truth, that I cannot ſlothfully ſuppreſs
the praiſes of ſo great a Perſonage, but am over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled
to give them their due <hi>Encomium,</hi> leaving to
others to dilate in flattering Diſcourſes.</p>

               <p>The CONTENTS. Of the Actions at Home, and in the Field, during the

            <p>IN ſuch a State of Affairs, although flouriſhing,
there is no queſtion to be made, but that the
Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> would have lifted up their
head, many amongſt us having already plotted a
Rebellion, and got together by divers practices,
fuel for the Combuſtion, had not <hi>Mazarine</hi> (his
Envyers carp at it, the ends being ſecret) obviated
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101520:29"/>
the imminent dangers, by entertaining the quieter
ſort of men with hope, gifts, and the ſweetneſs of
eaſe; and by ſcattering the active and military
men through <hi>Germany, Flanders, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi>
upon hard and deſperate Services towaſte and repel
the Enemy, leſt he ſhould be hindered by inteſtine
diſſenſions to carry on his Plot at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
            <p>[What would have been the conſequent if ſuch a
multitude of idle perſons having got head under a
minor King, and caſting of the Princes awe, ſhould
have been ſollicited to raiſe Civil Diſturbances: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the pledges of the Kingdom were grown to
full age, and the dearneſs of their Soveraign which
is made habitual by time, had cemented their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits?
The Eſtate not yet firmly ſetled, would have
been broke to pieces with diſcord, which his gentle
moderation did cheriſh for five years, and brought
to ſuch perfection, that being grown to full
ſtrength, it could bear any ſhock, though the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignancy
of the <hi>French</hi> Fate ſhould charge it never
ſo furiouſly.]</p>
            <p>Therefore waving Occurrents rather ordinary
than worthy the relating, I ſhall write only thoſe
paſſages, whoſe knowledge hath influence upon life,
counting it more eligible to edifie the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
than to feed the Fancy with an empty Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of Proceedings. Here is not to be expected
any Journal to give a particular account of Actions
with their Circumſtances: but you will find ſecret
Advices refined from vulgar Errours, ſhort and
myſtical: ſo that I confeſs he had need have a
piercing Judgment that can reach and fathom my
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101520:30"/>
meaning. He that is not provided of that, let him
not offer to meddle with my Book, but go about
ſome other buſineſs.</p>
            <p>The firſt Eſſay of the new King was the Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Rocroy. Roc-Roy,</hi> (or the Royal Rock) is a
Garriſon at the Entrance of the Foreſt of <hi>Ardenne,</hi>
fortified with ſtrong Works. Hardly any foot of
arable Land is near it. All the parts round about
it are over-run with Heath and Bryars. The place
is of ſuch importance, that the Garriſon which
holds it, may freely march up as far as <hi>Paris,</hi> and the
vaſt Plain of <hi>Champaigne</hi> lies open to be ſcoured
over by the Scouts from <hi>Rocroy.</hi> Nothing was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
more adviſable among the Officers of the
Army in the <hi>Low-Country,</hi> after the death of <hi>Lewis,</hi>
than to reduce that Frontier: Therefore <hi>May</hi> 12.
1643. <hi>Rocroy</hi> is cloſely beleaguered, the Out-works
are preſently ſtormed, the Defendents which were
about 500, not being able to make good ſuch a
Line againſt ſo furious an Attaque. The <hi>Spaniards</hi>
lodge in the neighbouring Quarters, more like
Conquerors than Combatants, <hi>Don Franciſco Melo</hi>
was Captain General. The Count <hi>Iſſemburgh,</hi> Duke
<hi>Albuquerque,</hi> and Count <hi>Fuentanon</hi> Lieutenants.
The Army conſiſted of 20000 men. Intelligence
being brought of this, <hi>Enguien</hi> who was quartered
in <hi>Picardy,</hi> united his Infantry which lay upon the
<hi>Auſe</hi> with his Cavalry lying upon the <hi>Oyſe,</hi> and
immediately ſent away <hi>Gaſſion</hi> with 500 Horſe to
ſcout, and do ſuch farther Execution as the matter
ſhould require. <hi>Gaſſion</hi> giving the Enemy perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Alarms, whilſt he and a Party are engaged,
conveys a 100 choice Muſquetiers into the beſieged
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:101520:30"/>
Caſtle, no ſmall relief to the Garriſon, that was
now ſorely diſtreſſed. <hi>Enguien</hi> with hard marches
having drawn together the whole of his ſtrength
on the 17. of <hi>May,</hi> quarters at <hi>Boſſue,</hi> a Town four
miles diſtant from <hi>Roc-Roy.</hi> Hither comes alſo
<hi>Gaſſion.</hi> A Counſel of War is called about the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
of <hi>Rocroy.</hi> There were ſome of opinion,
that they needed not give Battle, but only ſend in
ſuccour: the prevailing advice was to put it to a
pitched Field. There were narrow Lanes and By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paths
to be got over before the Forces could come
to draw up on even ground. That part is gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly
performed, and with notable ſucceſs. The
<hi>French</hi> could hardly be kept in from running upon
the Enemy, even at the very break of day. That
was the fiery courage of the <hi>French:</hi> yet there was
this farther conſideration: that a <hi>French-man</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
over from the Enemy, had informed that
<hi>Beke</hi> was upon his march, drawing near with a
Recruit to re-inforce the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> (Now <hi>Beke</hi>
was of no mean eſteem among both <hi>Wallons</hi> and
<hi>French.</hi> Such reward being given the Informer,
as his condition required, all things are prepared
for the hazard of a final deciſion. And now the
whole order of the future Engagement is brought
under the eye. All things are marſhalled with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
care and providence on both ſides: and
ſuch preparations made that night, as though a
Battel had been bid againſt the next day. <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guien</hi>
judging it better to ſtay till broad day-light,
encouraged them, and afterwards ſent them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh
themſelves. when this was done, he went
about the Companies ſtanding to their Arms, with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:101520:31"/>
the Field-Officers and his Attendants, inſpiring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Troops of Souldiers a fortitude worthy of
their ancient Glory and paſt Monuments. He
could neither endure to ſtand ſtill, nor would relieve
his wearied body with ſleep. The Army had at
no time ſeen the General ſo ſprightly: and did
readily draw from his undaunted looks an aſſured
conjecture of Victory. At length when the clear
light diſcovered ours and the Enemies Battalia, <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guien</hi>
rejecting the advice of his cautious friends,
clapt on a ſleight Breaſt-plate, and no Helmet, that
his face might be open, and manifeſt to the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
during the whole Engagement.</p>
            <p>The Battel was thus ſet in array, <hi>Gaſſton</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the right Wing, <hi>Hoſpital</hi> the left, with <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre.</hi>
The Wings were inforced with the reſerve
of <hi>Eſpenan. Enguien</hi> turned his quick eyes to the
right and to the left, preſuming upon Victory,
while the Event was yet in ſuſpenſe. Never was
Fortune braved with a more forward joy: yet
there were called to prayers for obtaining Victory,
the Prieſts a generation, believed by alas! too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a uſeleſs burden of the earth. The Conflict was
ſharp, and the Diſpute maintained with a ſtiff ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy.
Our left Wing came to a ſad misfortune.
<hi>Seneterre</hi> diſcharging manfully the part both of
Commander and Souldier, was ſhot and cut. He
having had his Horſe killed under him, was carried
off, and ſoon after came in again. The Enemies
too were poſſeſſed of our Ordnance, which the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling
valour or <hi>Hoſpital</hi> recovered: but when he
was wounded in the Arm, were loſt again, and
turned upon us: the fortune of the day was chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101520:31"/>
by <hi>Syrot</hi> who charged gallantly, and came to
ſuccour the left Wing that was in apparent danger,
and almoſt trampled down. The <hi>Wallons, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
and <hi>Italians</hi> being ſlain, the hardeſt part of
the work was behind to deal with a Regiment of
<hi>Caſtillians</hi> ſtout and invincible. The Infantry of
the right Wing had often charged, but always
without any ſucceſs. At length <hi>Gaſſion</hi> being not
ignorant of what importance that Regiment was,
bringing up with him the Horſe of the right Wing,
broke in upon the cloſe Ranks, and routed them.
Preſently the Enemies Army was totally defeated.
The cruel rage of our <hi>Switzars</hi> diſcharged their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
upon the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who counted it brave to die
before the face of their Commanders, rather than
to take Quarter. <hi>Fuentes</hi> the Maſter of the Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
in the Enemies Camp avoided the diſgrace
of flight, by dying in the Bed of Honour. Their
<hi>Switzars</hi> affected the reputation of having their
Colonel killed: who, during the Engagement, was
carried about in a Sedan: he had made oath never
to fight againſt the <hi>French,</hi> neither on Horſe-back,
nor on foot. The Count of <hi>Iſſemberg</hi> accounting
that there was leſs danger in running away, than in
being made Priſoner, eſcaped away wounded, and
a little after dyed of his wound. <hi>Melo</hi> (leaving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him his Commanders ſtaff, which came after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
into the victorious hands of <hi>Enguien,</hi> having
rid full eight miles by the ſwiftneſs of his Steed,
hid himſelf within the Town of <hi>Mariemburgh,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by a few that bore him company in his
flight, having abandoned his whole Army; and it
was a confeſſed truth, that the Souldier that day
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:101520:32"/>
fought like a moſt valiant General: and the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
run away like a moſt cowardly Souldier; only
the renown of <hi>Enguien</hi> gave him the glory of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been vanquiſhed by ſo great a Perſon. It was
now no longer a fight, but a mixt Carnage. A
ſlaughter here of one, there of whole Companies.
Limbs of men lye ſcattered about upon the ground:
Souldiers maimed and disabled, yet would not
leave graſping their Arms; till through the expence
of much blood, they ſunk down and dyed. Some
fled the ſhorteſt way; others got into the oppoſite
Wood, and paths unknown to the Purſuers. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men encounter with ſuch as are armed, and the
wounded with ſuch as are whole. As is the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
when fear poſſeſſeth the ſpirit. <hi>Enguien</hi> would
no longer purſue them upon the flight, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
their weary hands, their thirſty bodies,
their blunted Arms to be quiet: and having gone
through a buſineſs of ſingular danger, entred <hi>Roc-Roy</hi>
in Triumph. Now he owed this Victory more
to his Valour than Fortune. For he both drew up
his Army moſt skilfully, fought couragiouſly, and
with excellent judgment deſpiſed the loſs of his
great Guns, knowing that the main concern was
the keeping the Army in order, and holding the
field. Then what is rare in that heat of Paſſion,
and Age. He purſued them upon the flight, with
more prudence than eagerneſs. All that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
confeſſed that <hi>Hoſpital, Seneterre, Gaſſion, Syrot,
Eſpenan</hi> deſerved to have <hi>Enguien</hi> for their General,
and <hi>Enguien</hi> to have ſuch Officers. This hath been
too large in the Relation, but ſo many following
Engagements ſhall be all comprehended under this
one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:101520:32"/>
               <hi>Roc-Roy</hi> being relieved, <hi>Thionvilles</hi> Attaque is
reſolved upon. [It is a City of the Dukedom of
<hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> cut by the <hi>Mazelyn</hi> in two parts; the
one looks towards <hi>Metz,</hi> the other <hi>Triers:</hi> for it
hath two Gates, ſituated in a Valley, fortified with
Trenches and Bulwarks incomparably well.] At
that time judged to have been of great importance,
not ſo much to expiate the ſlaughter of <hi>Fequier,</hi> by
putting it to the Sword (which had been a quarrel
ſuiting our bravery) but that the <hi>French</hi> Territory
might be enlarged by ſuch an Acquiſt. Therefore
having waſted the Country, and reduced ſome few
Villages, on the thirtieth day after the Battel at
<hi>Rocroy,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Army came within view of <hi>Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onville,</hi>
with the ſame puſh of fortune carried.
<hi>Guere</hi> and <hi>Gaſſion</hi> went before to take up the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Quarters. <hi>Conde</hi> with prodigious ſwiftneſs
by the fourth days march came to <hi>Metz,</hi> and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit
of new-raiſed men being taken on there, his
Army was compleated in numbers. By the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
of the Commanders, by the works, activity, and
patience of the Souldiers, by the valour of <hi>Enguien,</hi>
within four months time after the Siege was laid,
there came into our hands that City famous to the
memory of poſterity, for the antiquity of its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
and frequent varieties of Fortune, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
eſcaped many caſualties, now as it were reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the new Peace cheriſhing all, doth reſt quietly
under the protection of the <hi>French</hi> clemency. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there had been aſſaults with variety of ſucceſs,
and many men loſt before it, when News came to
<hi>Paris,</hi> that <hi>Thionville</hi> was taken, there was infinite
rejoycing; the Churches were full of thoſe that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:101520:33"/>
give God thanks for the Victory: the Entry too of
<hi>Enguien</hi> being more celebrated than is the cuſtom
by the people, running in multitudes out of Town
to meet him, exceeded the uſual meaſure, of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>

At length as is the uſual Fate of Martial

weeping, gave an appearance to the Army looking

after he had given all his orders, as though he had

fell ſpeechleſs. The <hi>Germans</hi> contend in lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Gravity, each in equal weight. A Prudence
worthy of the ſtronger Sex, an aſſiſtance of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
care; oftentimes mounting on Horſe-back
to reſtrain Mutiniers. Not with Beads, or an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty
oſtentation of piety in kneeling before Altars,
but with a ſtout heart. Did not equal, but exceed
her Husbands cares. She loved the happy, defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

it was in Bounty. (Now what is more honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

thoſe petty Cities upon the <hi>Rhyne</hi> about <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacque,</hi>
were left under our Juriſdiction, which was

and their Leader <hi>Merck</hi> an old Commander and

that was then come to <hi>Saverne,</hi> certified by <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi>
of the Enemies Attempt, haſtens to <hi>Benfield</hi>
and thence to <hi>Briſack,</hi> where having conferred with,
<hi>Thurenne,</hi> he made no reſolution till he had firſt
viewed the ſtate of the matter upon the place. But
by this time the <hi>Bavarians</hi> had reduced <hi>Friburg to</hi>
neceſſity of Surrender, having come upon them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were expected. Afterwards having
drawn up their Army upon a rugged and ſteep
Mountain, and barricado'd within fell'd Trees, and
entrenched round, they conſulted in ſecurity what
courſe they ſhould take. <hi>Enguien</hi> in that boyſtrous
Current of Age, boiling with an ardent deſire to
fight, was of opinion to fall down-right upon the
Enemy; ſome judged that an oblique Compaſs
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:101520:37"/>
ſhould be fetched. He inſiſted that, Artifices
ſhould be let alone, and they muſt conquer with
valour that conquers all things. Never was, ſcarce
ever will be a more eager ardour of fighting. <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guien</hi>
himſelf, leaping off his Horſe, puſhed amidſt
the thickeſt of the Enemies. <hi>Thurenne</hi> fell upon
the Rear. It was judged more advantagious to be
united: ſo the two Camps were made one. They
fought eight hours, which is rare, with doubtful
ſucceſs, by reaſon of the continual rain. The night
came in good time to the Souldiers that were wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with their Coats ſoaked through with wet.
By the break of the next day, they are alarm'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:
the <hi>Bavarian</hi> not knowing to give ground,
but ſtill renewing the fight. At length it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that the Enemy endeavoured not a flight,
but Retreat. No men ever ſold their lives at ſo
dear a rate. That day opened the <hi>French</hi> a Road
into <hi>Germany,</hi> which <hi>Enguien</hi> ſo ranged over with
Victories, that by the attendance of Fortune, and
guidance of Valour, he reckoned ſo many ſucceſſes
as days. After <hi>Merck</hi> was conquered, no body was
aſhamed to be conquered: only <hi>Flesburg</hi> gave a
check to his rapid courſe. The firſt ſtorm diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
it ſelf like a clap of Thunder, with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
fury upon that, which being taken, the <hi>French</hi>
Troops pouring along upon both Banks of the
<hi>Rhyne,</hi> brought under their power <hi>Spira,</hi> the place
of the Imperial Diet, <hi>Mentz</hi> the Electors Seat, and
the pleaſant <hi>Worms.</hi> Hitherto ours dealt but with
ſingle Cities: afterwards fell upon all that lay in
their way in general, without ſo much as regarding
the ſituation of Places. This War proved unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:101520:38"/>
to the expectation of the <hi>German</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whoſe valour heretofore victorious over the
<hi>Romans,</hi> at this juncture appeared to have been ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perannuated.
At the ſame time <hi>Enguien,</hi> ſcarcely
having a beard, and but newly writing man, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
both to have diſpatched <hi>Germany,</hi> and to enter
upon Triumphs in all places, rowing along the
conquered <hi>Rhyne.</hi> Like fire, which having preyed
upon the obvious Wood, is checked by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of a River.</p>
            <p>The Inroad a while ſtopped at <hi>Mariandale</hi> (the
neighbouring Inhabitants call it <hi>Mergenſtheim.</hi>)
There <hi>Thurenne,</hi> [<hi>Enguien</hi> was a great way off]
being ſtraightned for proviſion, had diſperſed his
Forces for Forrage: whilſt himſelf ſecure of the
Enemies, conſulted what was to be done. The
<hi>Auſtrians</hi> and <hi>Bavarians</hi> under the Conduct of
<hi>Merck,</hi> and <hi>Hans Werth,</hi> ſuddenly aſſault him.
He gathering together what Forces the preſſing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
would permit, refuſed not to ſtand the utmoſt
tryal. <hi>Thurenne</hi> acting the part both of Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Souldier, ſtoutly ſeconded by <hi>Roſa,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the Enemy, charging with deſperate rage,
and at length when he could not be ſafe, even in
<hi>Merindol,</hi> leaving behind him his Baggage and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillary,
retired to the parts about the <hi>Main</hi> with his
Horſe. <hi>Trac</hi> did gallant ſervice, in heartning the
Souldiers. The reſt of ours eſcaped towards <hi>Fleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi>
and having paſſed the <hi>Rhyne</hi> at <hi>Spire,</hi> got ſafe
to <hi>Mentz,</hi> to joyn with <hi>Thurenne. Enguien</hi> being
certified of this unfortunate Engagement, obliged
<hi>Coniſmark,</hi> the <hi>Swede</hi> and <hi>Guez,</hi> Colonel of the
<hi>Heſſians</hi> (although they were averſe, and preſſed
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:101520:38"/>
after returning home into their Country) to tarry
but ſo long with him, till he had got a paſs upon
the <hi>Nicer. Glen</hi> was come up to re-inforce the
Enemies Army, not a little puffed up with their
ſucceſs at <hi>Merindol. Enguien</hi> having left all his
Baggage at <hi>Wiſloque,</hi> deſigned to ſurpriſe <hi>Hailbrun</hi>
between the <hi>Danube</hi> and <hi>Rhyne.</hi> The Enemies
which had a ſuſpicion of ſome ſuch intention, march
with unwearied haſte; and pitch upon a Hill not
far off from the Walls of <hi>Hailbrun,</hi> lying ſo, that
the <hi>Nicer</hi> running before them, ours could neither
enter <hi>Hailbrun,</hi> nor aſſail the Enemy. Therefore
it is reſolved to march on towards <hi>Frankendale</hi> and
the <hi>Danube. Coniſmark</hi> left our Army, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
his own deſigns. The <hi>Heſſians</hi> endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to do the like, but being restrained and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the <hi>Landgravinne,</hi> ſtayed with us. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
many Propoſals debated on all ſides, it is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to beat the Enemy up as far as the <hi>Danube:</hi>
and return to <hi>Hailbrun,</hi> but both Armies each day
marching in a parallel line, there were not wanting
light Skirmiſhes. A long time they ſhot their
Guns off in view of each other. A Moor lying
between hindred their engaging. Ours bent their
courſe towards <hi>Norling,</hi> the Enemies towards <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navert.
Enguien</hi> had an intention to turn for
<hi>Hailbrun,</hi> when of a ſudden he is informed that the
Enemy came on eager upon fighting, and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the River of <hi>Weran</hi> and our Army. <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guien</hi>
might eaſily have avoided it, had he not been
reſolved for the Encounter.</p>
            <p>His cheerfulneſs filled the hearts of all with hope.
Never was he more undaunted, never more ſecure:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:101520:39"/>
both Armies fell to prayers after a laudable cuſtom,
to encourage the Souldiers, who having performed

               </gap>ight, the Victory was publiſhed, nor were there
hidden the imminent ſigns of the deſtined ſucceſs.
The like hath been heretofore remarked among
the <hi>Romans.</hi> A Village with a Caſtle lying between
both Armies, was furiouſly battered with our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.
Thither came down the Enemies from the
top of the Hill, and ours at the ſame time. The
Diſpute ſeemed to have been about the ſurpriſing
a paultry Dorp. <hi>Enguien</hi> was every where conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
in his moſt noted Coat of Armour: and rid
among his Troops commending or reproving, as
every one merited, and ſtoutly inforced what parts
were weakned by the Enemies execution. When
our Army ſeemed to decline, <hi>Grammont</hi> comes in,
who having reſtored the day, is with <hi>Chatre</hi> taken
Priſoner, and carried to <hi>Muncken,</hi> the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of
<hi>Bavaria.</hi> The right Wing had bin utterly loſt, unleſs
new courage had been infuſed into the Souldiers by
the valour of <hi>Thurenne,</hi> who commanded the left.
Thither alſo comes up <hi>Enguien,</hi> twice wounded, and
having had two Horſes killed under him. The

Enemy having ſhewed what ſtubbornneſs they
could, were compelled to retire towards <hi>Donavert,</hi>
which Town having plundered, they paſt the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube;</hi>
never thinking themſelves ſafe, till they had
got on the other ſide. It was not judged pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to purſue: Their Guns and Baggage were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
the evidence of a compleat Victory. <hi>Merck</hi>
the General was ſlain. <hi>Glen</hi> taken, and the Duke

            <p>About the expiring of the year 1646. <hi>Henry
Bourbon,</hi> Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> not yet ſixty years old,
dyed an eaſie death. Lamented by <hi>France</hi> in ſuch a
juncture of Affairs, as one who by his Prudence and
equal Juſtice, did ſtay the State running into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions.
[He was born at S. <hi>Egers</hi> in <hi>Xantoigne,</hi>
after his Fathers death, who was poyſoned, by ill
practices. Henry IV. having no Iſſue, had trained
him up with all diligence, as his future Heir, having
weaned his Spirit in his tender years from the new
Religion, which he had ſucked in with his milk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
from his Father and Grandfather, in hereditary deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent:
He was ſo nurtured in the Catholick Rites,
that afterwards when he was grown up, he affected
the reputation of being a Capital Enemy to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novators,
in an empty oſtentation; which would
have been uſeful, as he conceived, if occaſion had
ſerved. But this is always beneath a great Prince,
who ought not to love, nor yet hate any ſuch thing
too much, and whom a lofty and gallant Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes,
ſlighting matters of that nature. His Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
with <hi>Charlotte Mommorancy</hi> had almoſt been
his ruine. For to avoid the being rivalled by King
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:101520:44"/>
               <hi>Henry,</hi> he fled into the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> for a Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his Wives chaſtity. From hence through
<hi>Germany</hi> he travels to <hi>Millan,</hi> with a ſmall Retinue,
to Count <hi>Fuentes.</hi> After that <hi>Henry</hi> was killed,
when the impious World did juſtly fear an eternal
night, <hi>Conde</hi> returning into <hi>France,</hi> unhappily took
the part of the Mutiners. (It is an ordinary practice
in <hi>France</hi> thus to diſturb the Minority of Kings;
by Rebellion unpuniſhed, and therefore frequent.
The diſorders being compoſed, which <hi>Conde</hi> had
headed, when he ſuſpected not the Kings venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
he is haſtily thrown firſt in the <hi>Baſtille,</hi> and
then into <hi>Vincennes.</hi> The tireſom condition of

bore him company, of whom he had <hi>Anne,</hi> married
to the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> then after his releaſe
from this place <hi>Enguien</hi> and <hi>Conti.</hi> Firſt Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of <hi>Guyenne,</hi> then of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Bourges,</hi> he
changed his courſe of life, and minded the raiſing
his Eſtate. The Families of Princes formerly rich,
and honourable, fell into decay by a delight in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificency:
the richer Furniture and Attendance
any one had, the more reputation and reſpect he
found in his Country and among his Tenants. That
Gallantry, and Fame for Generoſity, proving rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
to the Nobility, turned <hi>Conde</hi> to a wiſer courſe:
who having been formerly pinched with want,
brought into his houſe good husbandry, having
been the firſt Horder of his Family; and arrived at
old age, improving his money. Some did believe
that he was not ſordid, but only made as though
he had been ſordid. No better Maſter, no better
Servant, that is, more obſequious to ſuch as were
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:101520:45"/>
in power. He was moſt lively and ſpirituous: a
marvellous ſweetneſs, marvellous gayety in his
humor: Would ſeaſon his pleaſures with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition
of ſtudies, lengthen his entertainments
with cheerful diſcourſe, and be pleaſed with trifles,
but not taken: having laid upon his carriage this
law of humility, that he would never ſeem to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
He converſed with others, not ſo as to
require them to think that he left an obligation
upon them in condeſcending to admit them into
his company. Nothing was more methodical
than the whole courſe of <hi>Condes</hi> life: Every action
had its proper ſeaſon; and each year they return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their due periods, as by a Kalendar. Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
couragious, when under apprehenſions from
the Court, timerous.]</p>
            <p>The King fell dangerouſly ſick, which gave no
unjuſt ground of fear. The ſmall Pox came out, a
ſad contagion; an humor boils with a fiery Fever;
that preys upon all the graces of the face. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
preserving his Majeſty, and with only a
few prints of the diſeaſe left. In the mean time he
grew up under the Inſtructions of <hi>Hardovin Perefix,</hi>
Abbot of <hi>Beaumont,</hi> a man of a pleaſant gravity and
wiſdom, afterwards Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> who
might have been ſtyled the Kings <hi>Seneca,</hi> but that
he happened upon a <hi>Trajan.</hi>

after the <hi>Caſtillian</hi> faſhion, proudly. The people
complain, that are not ſatisfied. The Sedition was

thinking of nothing leſs than of getting a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
He is invited by the Republick of <hi>Naples,</hi>
being but newly come into the World (for ſo it

that he ſhould be ſought to, poſting away with
all his might, broke out of Town, and committed
himſelf and all his Fortunes, to a ſmall Bark. [How

arrives happily, although through a thouſand dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
received with popular, that is, immoderate
applauſe, (for in ſuch things they have no meaſure.)
The vaſtneſs of the ſwelling Sedition paſſeth all
bounds; they flouriſh in their Trophies, that they
may appear not to be more huge than forward
The new General having been toſſed with variety
of Fates, rejoyces at the unuſual Honour. Now
he eſtimates what is his power, but especially what
is the pleaſure of <hi>France,</hi> whoſe aid more than once
he in vain implores (whether that that Kingdom
were encumbred with other occaſions, or upon

end of his life, he grew to be diſguſted by the
Court. Taxed of <hi>Cromwelliſm,</hi> as though he had
thoughts of paſſing into <hi>England,</hi> and offering his
Service to that Tyrant. Some ſaid, to the <hi>Holland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
At laſt he died of his wound. <hi>Perhaps it is

            <p>About that time the <hi>Venetian</hi> Republick oppreſt
by the Great <hi>Turk,</hi> in vain implored the ſuccours of
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes. This was the occaſion of the
War. A Knight of <hi>Malta</hi> met a Galley of <hi>Rhodes</hi>
in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> and made Prize of it. In this
there was a <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> who being carried off to <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
was original of theſe miſchiefs. The <hi>Muſulman</hi>
ſtormed, complaining to our Ambaſſadors of the
Affront received, as though the Order of <hi>Malta.</hi>
were at our controul. But his eſpecial Complaint
was to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſador, becauſe the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
Gallies had not relieved his, when it was in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity.
He debates about invading <hi>Malta;</hi> and
when the difficulty of the Enterpriſe was ſuggeſted,
he thought of <hi>Sicily,</hi> then of <hi>Calabria:</hi> at length
the fury of his vengeance flamed out upon poor

tolerated among the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> nay, even
by the High-Prieſt. And that the Common-wealth
never concerned it ſelf what this or that body did with
her skin; that there is puniſhment enough in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ſuch a ſcandalous profeſſion. <hi>Thus was pleaded
among the idler ſort. Some more inſolent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
thus far:</hi> That therefore were Prieſts main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and ſo many crews of Cordeliers, and Capucins
to attone God for incurrent ſins. That ſuch neceſſary
evils were uſeful to mankind, for avoiding worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents.
That a Whore, if the queſtion be rightly
ſtated, is nothing elſe but a kind, innocent Creature,
ready to bring men content, that long after them at all
hours. That they think this a more happy life, than
to work in Shops, or toil in the fields. But that by
Bawds the hearts of mortals were linked; that young
men are not called off from their buſineſs, by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing,
but are ſet forward in a quicker diſpatch.
<hi>Theſe and ſuch like ſpeeches were given out in the
City, and Court eſpecially. But as falls out uſually
amongſt us, theſe Laws ſeverely executed at firſt, at
the concluſion vaniſhed into neglect, through a
ſlack inquiſition.</hi> For Lovers are not cruel, nor do
men moſt grievouſly puniſh what they moſt commonly
practiſe. (I think ſuch to be the moſt perfect, who ſo
pardon others, as though themſelves did daily offend:
and ſo abſtain from offending, as though thy pardoned
no body. Therefore it is a good rule to hold through
the whole courſe of our life, the being implacable to
our ſelves, and exorable to all others. He that hates
vices, hates men. The excurſions of luſt, and the like
furies, are with great watchfulneſs and ſpecial endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to be reſtrained by counſel and perſwaſion, from
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:101520:50"/>
the breaſts of Noble-men and Women: Becauſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
that Houſe, that State, that Kingdom will
eaſily be maintained in eternal Honour, where the
diſorderly love of Women bears the leaſt ſway. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever
that moſt aſſured bane of mankind inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
it ſelf, there infamy rings, and injury reigns.
Therefore we muſt keep at a great diſtance from theſe,
and purſue courſes contrary to ſo dreadful vices. <hi>It
was a ſhameful thing to ſtir thoſe matters, which
having been ſtirred, would have ſtunk filthily; and
to be fierce againſt poor Whores, when noble La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
did proſtitute themſelves without puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>)</p>
            <p>There was then in propoſal, whether for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating
the floods cauſed by the <hi>Seyne,</hi> the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
ſtreams by which that River is ſwelled,
ſhould be diverted another way; or whether by
cutting a Chanel himſelf, ſhould be abated. At
length, either becauſe the difficulty of the work de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
or to avoid charges, nothing was altered:
(Nor ever will be altered, till the <hi>French</hi> are out of
their Wits. <hi>Nature the common Mother, hath beſt
provided for mans uſe, in laying out the months of
Rivers, their courſes, their home, and ſource, after a
due line.</hi>) Thus doth the <hi>Seyne,</hi> neither (ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in his Chanel, nor rob'd of his auxiliary waters,
not ungloriouſly flow with his former Pomp.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mazarine,</hi> that he might not be thought to mind
the Wars only; furniſhed a Library in favour of
the Studious, with Books to be read over in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ages: amongſt all which, none will be more
eminent than that which ſhall contain the mans
own Acts. One might behold ſhelves raiſed up
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:101520:50"/>
to the top of the Roof, where through a luxury of
Literature, was ſet up a learned Pile, not as Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of a <hi>Palais,</hi> but Inſtruments of Wiſdom, not
ranked for a ſhew, but for uſe; to which the Repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitories
of ſo many Volumes, ſet up by the Kings of
<hi>Pergamus</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> with great emulation
may not compare; nor that of <hi>Pollio,</hi> who firſt
ſetting up a Library at <hi>Rome,</hi> made mens Wits a
matter of publick Commerce. He provided far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all ſorts of Horſes; one might have ſeen ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the rich Mangers whatſoever breeds the moſt
generous Studds had produced in a long Race.
Being ſumptuous in Building, as in other matters,
he furniſhed a <hi>Palais</hi> with Houſhold-ſtuff, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
rich; with Pictures, Images, Statues, as
though he would have tranſported <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Paris.</hi>
In a Royal converſation, neatneſs, and Spirit, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the Paterns of great Kings. But in the
procuring and purchaſing ſuch things, left <hi>France</hi>
ſhould return to its old rudeneſs, he expended thoſe
means, which others hoard up for their particular
uſes, to the entertainment of the preſent Age, and
Poſterity. But who would have thought that ſo
diſmal times would ever have overtaken us, as that
all theſe things, through ignoble envy, ſhould by
Act of Parliament be ſold at a publick Out-cry.
Nor are Jewels to be paſſed over, in heaping up of
which, I know not whether he had more Bravery
or Fortune. To be ſure the Fame of them ſpread
through the remote Countries of the World, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Grand <hi>Mogol,</hi> who is Lord over all the
Northern <hi>Indies,</hi> to give out by his Merchants in
this place, that he was ready to purchaſe whatſoever
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:101520:51"/>
precious ſtones ſhould be tranſported from <hi>Paris To
Agra</hi> (after that <hi>Mazarines</hi> occaſions were fully
ſatisfied) that is the Metropolis of that great Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.
<hi>The</hi> Mogor <hi>envying the celebrated Vineyard of</hi>
Preſter John <hi>the Emperor of the farther</hi> Aethiopia,
<hi>that is of the</hi> Abiſſines, <hi>would himſelf alſo be glorious
in a like Gallantry, ſo that the winding branches of
his likewiſe might twine about beaten maſſie gold:
and that not on dwarfed ſtakes, at is the</hi> Abiſſines,
<hi>but high Poles; the cluſters might ſhine with Saphirs
and Carbuncles: the Walks paved with bright Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,
and bordered with the Green of Emraulds.
From the barren Land comes no Vintage; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
bearing increaſe, it bleſſes the Vine-dreſſer, and
never fails his hope, being content with being gleaned
by the eye only.</hi> There was at this time a Staple, ſo
that many of our Merchants went over to <hi>Agra,</hi> and
came back in a bleſſed condition.</p>
            <p>There were alſo <hi>Operas</hi> for Comical Scenes, ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly
built, and Actors fetched from all parts.
Nothing was happier than <hi>Paris</hi> at that time. It
triumphed abroad, fearing nothing at home. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſchiefs
of Factions, no cruelty of Plots, the ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Court being clouded by no diſcontent.
The Queen-Mother not yet exerciſed by the Fates,
through their clemency, found by experience, that
nothing was more delightful than her Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>Mazarines</hi> Juſtice appeared in determining
of Cauſes, and his ſingular affability towards thoſe
who brought their Complaints and Requeſts to
him. Every hour he admitted to Audience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ſurly Introducer: would never interrupt
any one in his Speech, till the modeſty of the Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:101520:51"/>
warned him to be ſilent. His glory was yet
unſpotted with any ſlander. He healed whatever
was wounded, not rip'd up: nor would examine
ſtrictly every trivial matter, that he might be
thought to have found, and not made us good.
Money flew about him plentifully in the City; for
<hi>Julius</hi> was not yet given out to think of the hoard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up of it; who though he were naturally tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
acquired a reputation of bounty by a nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly
way of giving. He had not as yet avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
abandoned himſelf to a deſire after Wealth.
He ſeemed to poſſeſs, not to be poſſeſſed.(As malice
and envy afterwards ſpoke falſely of the man.)
Publick Charges, Eccleſiaſtical and Secular Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
not diſmembred, not with a large portion of
them intercepted were the rewards of only vertue.
The faith of the Courtiers was not yet engaged by
Bribes. Who would think of ſuch a ſudden, that
all ſhould change, and this Summer-calm turn into
ſtorms more grievous than Winter-tempeſts.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all the Tribe of the Scholars to whom yet
he had founded and dedicated his Library, jear and

This hath been obſerved, that almoſt nothing hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from the Wits of that Nation, which promiſes
immortality: whereas in other things</hi> France <hi>is one
of the moſt famous Countries of the whole World, and
fruitful in ſo many Commodities; it is barren in this
only. Spirits naturally inclined to Drollery and
Jeſt: a faculty of talking</hi> extempore, <hi>with ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
perhaps of raillery. They haunt great mens
Tables, wander about their Academies, trick and trim
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:101520:52"/>
their native tongue without end, and boaſt of having
refined their Language: they trot about this way
and that way to make Viſits, do not delight in ſecret
ſolitude, which is the only ferment of ſtudies. They
contend in moſt barbarous Emulations, whereupon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth

Scholars in tongue, would uſe detraction upon
their Couches, and in their Circles; they would
curiouſly unravel the Government, watch the

and more and more queſtion the mans Honeſty.
Some of them proſtitute themſelves, to ſearch our
ſome State-ſecret, infect their Husbands unawares
with the malignancy. Theſe were the means that
gave birth, theſe that gave growth to the diſtempe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>At that time four not ill-humor'd, but ſuch as

when their deſigns failed, as is uſual, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemning
themſelves, turned Nuns by a falſe
diſſembling of Religion, and a groſs ſuperſtition,
the door being ſhut to their vices grown out of

Looking-glaſs, by its own peremptory ſentence,
doth dread it ſelf. It is a high task not to fight

The people watching for Changes and
Troubles follow their Examples, as is common.
Openly, that <hi>Mazarine</hi> muſt be removed, by whom
the work of Peace was obſtructed: that the ſubtle
man loved War, that ſo he might conceal his
Robberies.</p>
            <p>The Princes under-hand abetted him, yet did
the like by their Creatures and Emiſſaries; nay,
even gave out, that they would not have <hi>Mazarine</hi>
removed, but awed, that ſo they might fiſh from
him, kept in fear, what they liſted, that they could
not have a more able Miniſter: they muſt take
heed, leſt baniſhing away the <hi>Italian,</hi> they ſhould
come into the hands of ſome bold <hi>French-man,</hi> who
would reſtrain their unreaſonable Suits, which were
infinite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mazarine</hi> took no notice of all this, and by a
prudent moderation withſtood the ſtorm: Scattered
all about embers covered with aſhes, upon which
they like blind men, and not well verſed in Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
walked, as the iſſue proved. I do not think
that ever any Inſurrection, ſupported by ſo great

There were not wanting that took encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to enter upon theſe troubles from the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi>
who proſpered, although they had revolted
from their King. <hi>Charles I.</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
over three Kingdoms, with the affections of his
Subjects. Not being contented with this happy
ſtate of Affairs, he would innovate ſome things in
Worſhip, that ſo <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> which is ſapleſs and
ſlovenly, might look fine in a handſom dreſs, trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
up with the Ceremonies. <hi>Scotland</hi> firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
the new Liturgy, which the Parliament of

Religion, (<hi>Popery</hi> they call it;) the ſame way
alſo did the <hi>Scotch</hi> Parliament lean. Theſe were
the firſt beginnings of the Trouble. Nothing is
more certain, then that neither the King, nor Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Primate of <hi>England,</hi> had any

ſeemed ſo eſtablished in multitude of Succeſſors, that
there was no room, nor creviſe even for the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous

turn Power into Licentiouſneſs. But there is ſome
occaſion too given by Subjects, who are refractory, and
perverſe, and unthankeful towards the beſt. Princes
reſent that with trouble and diſdain, and ſo by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
take off their affections; the more, if there be
Sedition, or Rebellion, or Plottings: Then they think
they have juſt title to oppreſs and afflict, All ſmart
for the guilt of the major part. <hi>Bleſſed we, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

the Sword drawn but againſt the Enemy! For this
reaſon the Publick Felicity ſeems to have ſingled
out</hi> Mazarine <hi>to bring him to this Government,
who hath ſo principled the young King. For how
great mildneſs have we found in his life time, how
great do we enjoy ſince his death, from the beſt and

            </p>
            <p>But neither did favours, nor clemency work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
men to alter their minds. The ſtorm every
day more furiouſly diſcharged upon <hi>Mazarine.</hi> The
Grandees rejoyced, provided to be ſtill craving,
who accounted former conceſſions, not a ſtop, but
a ſtep to farther Petitions. A man of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
and then admitted with favour to the
Cardinals ear, adviſed him to fortifie his Intereſt
with potent Friendſhips and Alliances; that he
was therefore undervalued, becauſe he had not ſure
footing in <hi>France;</hi> that he ſeemed as though he
had thoughts of returning into his Country, when
he had made his Fortunes: that theſe and the like
words were given abroad; that great ſums of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
were tranſmitted to <hi>Rome;</hi> he had there
bought and furniſhed a Houſe; forgetting our
Eſtate, had Banks of money out at uſe in <hi>Venice</hi> and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:101520:55"/>
               <hi>Genoua. Mazarine</hi> hearkened to the Counſel, as
appeared, beneficial, as the iſſue proved, afflictive.</p>
            <p>Therefore firſt of all he thought of matching his
Nephew <hi>Mancini</hi> with the only Daughter of the
Count <hi>d'Ales,</hi> the Couſin Germain of <hi>Conde.</hi> [How
much ſpirit did he think was in <hi>Conde,</hi> whoſe Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
he eſteemed the remedy of his Troubles! In
truth <hi>Conde</hi> ſtood in <hi>Condes</hi> own light, or elſe he
might have carried all in <hi>France</hi> before him. I am
aſſured, that it was the top of <hi>Mazarines</hi> ambition,
to have been ſerviceable to him as his Maſter.] The
Princes mind, in this particular miſtaken, refuſed the
offer; being able to acquire, as he thought, of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
more glory, than if he ſhould ſeem to depend
on an odious Miniſter. (Not in this point only,
but every where elſe he forfeited great opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and equalled not his vaſt Succeſſes with any
prudence.) <hi>Conde</hi> ſeemed to ſlight ſuch a Match,
which <hi>Mazarine</hi> made uſe of me to ſue for. <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueville</hi>
being certified of the whole buſineſs, as he
was greedy to find occaſions, voluntarily interpoſes
himſelf; promiſing his effectual aſſiſtance, not
without a reward. [For he, that needed nothing
but quiet, thought it a diſparagement in troubleſom
times to get nothing: and when a fire was kindled
not to warm his own fingers. And being ſeriouſly
adviſed, that in a bad Age he would dare to be
good, could never be brought to put off that humor
of traſſicking.] <hi>Whereas no ſort diſpoſiton ſtands
upon ſo unſteady ground, looking over with a readineſs
to precipitate into folly and vanity, but it may eaſily
be managed by the rein of prudence, to return into the
ſtraight path; only our Princes, incapable of any, but
ſuborned advice, draw againſt it.</hi>)</p>

               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:101520:55"/>
Therefore did <hi>Longueville</hi> require the Command
of <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> as the reward of <hi>Mancinis</hi> Match,
againſt all conſcience and reaſon: whereas upon
that ſole account of having the Government of
<hi>Normandy,</hi> he ought to be debar'd from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of a Caſtle, purpoſely built to bridle that
Governor. The Cardinal anſwered me, when I
requird <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> that it was not at his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal;
and he wondred in this ſtate of Publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
he would preſs ſuch an unſeaſonable Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that was declined by <hi>Orleans</hi> and <hi>Conde,</hi> as
diametrically oppoſite to the Kings Intereſts. <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueville</hi>
replies, he would not have the ſtrong Hold
for his own uſe, but that it might be a Sanctuary
for the King in diſtreſs, and <hi>Mazarine</hi> himſelf
would ſhortly be obliged to quit <hi>Paris,</hi> and flye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Normandy,</hi> which unleſs the Caſtle of <hi>Havre de

Sedition. <hi>Well,</hi> ſaid Mazarine, <hi>go carry the Duke
word, that I will do my endeavour to give him abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
ſatisfaction.</hi> This I related word for word.
<hi>Then,</hi> ſaith Longueville, <hi>I ſhall have</hi> Havre de
Grace: <hi>Mazarine,</hi> ſay I, <hi>ſaid not ſo: but pray, go to
his Eminence your ſelf, and there your Grace may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his full meaning. I will not do it,</hi> replies Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueville,
<hi>I like the ambiguouſneſs of the promiſe.</hi> In
the mean time he boaſts, that <hi>Havre de Grace</hi> was
promiſed him. This <hi>Mazarine</hi> denies; <hi>Longue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
affirms. I am called in as Witneſs in preſence
of <hi>Orleans</hi> and <hi>Conde.</hi> I report the matter faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
as it was. Both of them are condemned by
<hi>Orleans, Longueville,</hi> that he had taken in too ſtrict
a ſenſe words of a large import. <hi>Mazarine,</hi> that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:101520:56"/>
he had deluded <hi>Longueville</hi> with vain hopes in uſing
ſuſpenſe, terms of which he had always infinite in
ſtore. The injury of ſcorning his Alliance, and
this conteſt occaſioned a difference, from whence
afterwards grew diſtaſte, malice, and at laſt impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment,
and innumerable troubles, of which I ſhall
ſpeak in the next Book.</p>
            <p>Here follow the Civil Commotions, whoſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
were therefore the more violent, becauſe unjuſt.
The Nation valiant in Arms, of a vaſt Bulk within
it ſelf, not to be managed, only able to effect its
own deſtruction, happy if it could endure to expect
with patience, as it is forward to conceive ſudden
hopes, without the diſturbance of an unadviſed and
eaſie inclination to change, could no longer reſt in
the Harbour of Happineſs. This muſt be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
added, that Families exhauſted with Luxury,
Debts contracted, Eſtate and Credit conſumed, and
decays of Fortunes neither reparable by empty Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
nor Gifts extorted from the Court, were the
effectual incentive of Civil war.</p>

City, the grounds and cauſes of Civil Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions;
which ariſing upon ſeveral occaſions,
were delightful to our Enemies, ſucceſsuful to our

the King. <hi>France</hi> made of it ſelf a ſad ſpectacle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Here <hi>Mazarine</hi> making head againſt the aſſaults of
Fate, laid all his hopes to ſtake: and bearing in his
mind the whole Scheme of the Government, ſo
maintained the Authority of the young and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
King, that in five years time the ſtouteſt Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
were ſubdued, and he received the State weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Civil diſſenſions under his peaceful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.
The truth of Hiſtory will be queſtioned, when
it ſhall perſwade Poſterity, that this Peace was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
without any great Execution: and that only
gentleneſs wrought a bluſhing to offend. This
Book with the five following, will be full of variety
of Events, cruel in Battels, and jarring with Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
You will every where meet with Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers

            <p>It was 1648. which year the Aſtrologers did
prognoſticate would prove unlucky to the State of
<hi>France.</hi> [Whether their predictions be vain, and
it is but our credulity to invade future Events; or
whether it be our errour to miſinterpret the great
deſign of the Fates: to be ſure many Prodigies on
Earth and in the Heavens, were ſome denunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the celeſtial wrath.] <hi>France</hi> being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with its high ſucceſſes, had turned the eye
of the aſtoniſhed World upon it. The more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperouſly
our Aflairs ſucceeded, the more ſpeedily
the diſaffected thought their intentions of raiſing
Civil Commotions were to be executed; pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what is ordinary in ſuch caſes, the Publick good.
<hi>That the grievances of the people were intolerable;
The Provinces were pilled, by Exciſe-men; and the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:101520:57"/>
City it ſelf groaned under the burden of Taxes: That
the Treaſury was drained; and the French money to
the aſtoniſhment of the</hi> Spaniard <hi>conveyed into</hi> Italy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Michael Particelli,</hi> a <hi>Luceſe</hi> by birth, called <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
Emery,</hi> was Superintendent of the Finances, or
Receiver General. An able perſon, and eſpecially
an expert Chequer man, but voluptuous. He had
uſed himſelf to eaſe; tender over his body; but
never minding Religion, as an unneceſſary buſineſs.
His body, clog'd the vigour of his mind, which by
his intemperance he brought to the grave before its
time. The publick ſtorm fell hard upon him. It
was not <hi>Emery</hi> was ſought after, but under him an
occaſion of riſing. I cannot deny but that he, like
a ſubtile man, transferred the publick miſchiefs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> to ſave himſelf from the
imminent dangers: would cry up his prudence and
wit; he only wanted Experience of the <hi>French</hi>
State. Such ſort of Praiſers, are the moſt pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Tribe. Then <hi>Particelli</hi> was of advice, that the
Statute of <hi>Paulet</hi> ſhould be repealed, that is, a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
for Parliament men, paying the King a
certain annual Rent, to continue that Office in their
Families. <hi>[Paulet</hi> under <hi>Henry</hi> IV. was the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of that device. Before <hi>Francis</hi> I. Publick Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
were not bought and ſold, but were the rewards

the Parliament would be bridled, and ranged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
its duty. But by threatning this from time to
time, he provoked the Parliament, that was greedy
after Changes, and incenſed it againſt himſelf.
From hence aroſe Complaints, Reproaches, Debates,

Therefore he ſeemed fit to be made the ſubject of
the tinkling Cymbal to ſound for the publick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content.
The ſeeds of Civil diſcord are fomented
every day more than other. The Maſters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
publiſh a Libel very derogatory to the Kings
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:101520:58"/>
Authority. They unite with the Parliament, and
joyn together in diſobedience to the Kings Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
They agitate about the male-adminiſtration
of the Kingdom;</hi> That the publick money was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>employed
to private uſes, thereupon there was no Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury,
no Common-wealth; that burdens were laid
upon the people, ſuch as they were no longer able to
bear; That there was an end of the French Empire:
ſome perſon muſt be found out to relieve the diſtreſſed
State. Now if any one thought the Kings Revenue too
ſmall, it would have the defect ſupplied, not by oppreſſing
the Subject, but by good husbandry, that every one ſhould
limit his expences, not after his luſts; which are unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,
but according to his means. That it was but
a pretended complaint, that the Kings Revenue was
not ſufficient for his Disburſements: whenas ſo many
former Kings have lived upon them with credit and
ſplendour, have been renowned in the Field, and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to their Enemies both in Peace and War. <hi>The
more ſtrictly theſe Meetings were prohibited, the
more often were they held.</hi> Blammeny, Charton,
<hi>and</hi> Brouſſel, <hi>ſpeak more boldly than the reſt.</hi> That
in the Minority of the King, the Charge of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
lay upon the Parliament; time would, come, as,
heretofore hath fallen out, that the King coming to
Age, and entring himſelf upon managing the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
would call the Parliament to an account for the
miſ-government of the State of <hi>France.</hi> Therefore

Blood ſhould be ſo tame, as that none of them ſhould

And, what is more ſcandalous, that the <hi>Italian</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters

            <p>All this was ſaid, and much more bitter ſpeeches,
which becauſe they were thrown abroad in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
talk, I forbear to ſet down in this place. At
length the matter came to that paſs, as that when
the prohibited Meetings were held againſt the
Kings Will in uſual manner, and the diſcontents
daily grew higher: it was judged convenient to
imitate the wiſdom of Mariners, who, when a
tempeſt is riſen, lighten the Ship by throwing!
over-board the burden which might endanger all.
So it was thought convenient to diſmiſs <hi>Emery,</hi>
which gave a Preſident of very ill conſequence.
From thence did not come the end of their boldneſs,
but a farther ſtep. <hi>Mazarine</hi> did not like it at all:
but being over-born with much difficulty, was
drawn to comply with ſuch as gave unſound Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:101520:60"/>
He knew all, but could not act all that he
ſaw needful, waiting for the proper ſeaſon, which
no man did more wiſely imploy, than his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence:
he would work by gentle means, what
others perſwaded him to carry by rough. Bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in promiſes, by which he brought over not a
few; rendred others of mad, ſtark mad: while
they reported to the people, that they had been
tamper'd withal by Bribes to deſert the Kingdom
oppreſſed under a grievous weight; but would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
loſe their lives, than betray their truſt. The
Commons grow more and more inſolent. The
City is rent into Parties. Thoſe which adhered to
the King are called <hi>Mazariniſts:</hi> ſuch as pretended
in idle words to maintain the Publick Good, <hi>Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deurs</hi>
or <hi>Slingers.</hi> [It hath been a conſtant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
in all memory, that ſuch as attempt new alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations

Nick-name, as deſcretive of their Party.] <hi>Slingers</hi>
they were called, becauſe they had reſolved like
<hi>David</hi> to bring down the Giantlike greatneſs of
<hi>Mazarine.</hi> In the mean time the Tumults did not
aſſwage, but grew higher; becauſe the Grandees
having ſearched into the apprehenſions of the
Court, revealed all their intentions to the Faction.
No man could be ſecure of another. Wherein the
ſupereminent parts of <hi>Mazarine</hi> did out-ſhine and
ſurpaſs all: that being betrayed by his moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
friends, he could by his proper Judgment and
piercing Counſel ſcatter ſuch a thick Cloud of
Troubles. It was weighed in the Privy Counſel
with a ſcrupulous ſcale of debate what courſe was
teſt to be taken, whether to yield to the time and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:101520:61"/>
riſing ſtorm, or to reſtrain the Seditious by making
ſome terrible Example. <hi>Mazarine</hi> was of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<hi>That they ſhould ſail with a ſide-wind and

which being by many diſliked, at laſt proved bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial

any Judge think much to lend hit ears to honeſt

can be concealed. In truth the ſhews of</hi> Mazarine

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:101520:63"/>
ears. The beſieged in the <hi>Louvre</hi> and the Beſiegers
had their different fears. The Citizens threatned
by their Arms what the <hi>Spaniard</hi> durſt not have
preſumed. The Spirits of the honeſt party were
overwhelmed with pity and care: but, what is
always wont to fall out in ſo great Conſternation,
every one would be giving of counſel, few would
undertake what had danger.</p>
            <p>This menacing night, and offering to break out
into ſome horrid outrage, the carefulneſs of <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>
did allay. He walked the Rounds undaunted,
not in Robes ſuited to his Dignity, but having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed
the gracefulneſs of his looks in a Perruque:
Sets Sentinels and Guards at ſeveral places here and
there, giving this charge, <hi>Neither to fright, nor be
frighted: but watching all motions to reſtrain vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
not provoke it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When it was day <hi>Peter Seguier</hi> Chancellour of
<hi>France,</hi> is diſpatched to the Parliament, to carry
them the Kings Orders: or in truth to try what
was their intention. The Common-people did
not go forth in duty and reſpect to meet and wait
upon him: but received him with ſowre menaces,
and looks that declared more of obſtinacy, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
The Chancellour paſſed on with a
countenance formed to gentleneſs, beckning all the
way as he went to the people to keep ſilence. They
roared with fierce exclamations: Raſcals thronged
about the Coach: ſometimes there was a confuſed
murmuring: other times a terrible out-cry, as
their passions varied in height: they beſet the
Coach, examining him, <hi>Whither he was going? that
he too might croſs the peoples intereſts after his old
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:101520:64"/>
wont?</hi> At once they ruſh upon him, and threaten
to tear up the ſtones that the ſtreets are paved with.
And he was now ready to be crowded to death
with the violence of the preſs, when he was ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
by getting to the <hi>Hoſtel de Luyne:</hi> which as
it was the place of his Birth, was his Mother and
almoſt his Grave. Theſe being concealed from the
fury of the Rout, which filled the Houſe with ſwag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering
and menaces, he eſcaped through the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of God by the errour of the Searcher. How
nearly, you may judge by this, that he had no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
thoughts or coming off with life, but how to
die decently. Thus was that place ennobled by
having concealed him who is worthy to be ſhewed
to all poſterity. Through the ſingular favour of
Fortune, which permitted the hope of the Laws,
over-born by corrupt Manners to lie hid in ſafety.
When the Court came to hear of this, the Queen
was much concerned, left the life of ſuch an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Perſon ſhould fall into the hands of baſe Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.
So <hi>Meilleray</hi> on Horſe-back with <hi>Dort,</hi> break
through the ſeditious Crew: and having reſcued
the Chancellor from that imminent danger, convey
him back ſafe to the Queen in a Coach half torn:
the Guard being frighted, and ſome of them ſlain.
The Sedition breaks out farther, and the madneſs of
the people riſes to higher exaſperation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>F. Paul Gondy</hi> deſigned Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi>
(commonly ſtyled Coadjutor,) in his Pontifical
Robes, carrying with him a Veneration as he paſſed
along the ſtreets, moderated the people with Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
and Geſture; <hi>He would treat about their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals;
the King was neither without clemency, nor
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:101520:64"/>
yet ſeverity.</hi> Some there were that taxed <hi>Gondy,</hi> as
if his heart he had been ſomewhat favouring Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
However the matters were in truth, that
was the firſt day of <hi>Gondy</hi>'s withdrawing, and the
cauſe of all thoſe evils, which that Prelate eminent
in mind, birth, and merits, fell into afterwards;
from this time he ſhall be ever after called the
Archbiſhop of <hi>Corinth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At length the Parliament ſent the choiceſt part
of their Body to his Majeſty, to requeſt the releaſe
of their Fellow-members. They proceeded, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalled
two and two in long Files on foot, graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
nodding upon the Commoners as they paſſed
along. <hi>Mole</hi> the prime Preſident of the Parliament
(who never wanted a dextrous application in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
any buſineſs) with freedom and gravity
thus addreſt to her Majeſty. <hi>That thoſe had been
evil Counſels to rend out of the Parliament honeſt men
and good Patriots, charged only for maintaining the
Liberties of their Country, and that on a day of moſt
ſolemn Rejoycing, all ſuſpicion of it being blinded by
occaſion of the publick Feſtival. That nothing is more
pernicious, nor to the diſhonour of the French Nation,
than to handle violently what with time and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
hath always found good ſucceſs in our State. That
thoſe who gave ſuch advice, were the men that raiſed
the Tumults, and continued ſo to do day after day.
That here was no need of long deliberation, but the
Priſoners to be releaſed: nor muſt the Kings Honour
or Authority be pretended; but that the ſafety of the
Kingdom is the ſupreme Law. That what he ſays
were no illuſions or pretences, that 100000 men in
Arms attended for Monſieur</hi> Brouſſel. <hi>That when
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:101520:65"/>
men had Arms in their hands, they were allowed any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
when before they were denied reaſon. For Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance,
Duty, Reverence there was an end of them.
Theſe were all trodden under foot. He trembled to
relate the ſad courſes that he ſaw taken.</hi> To this
the Queen anſwered in ſhort; the Chancellor ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
larger, <hi>That the Privy Council would take care
that their Propoſals ſhould be ſatiſfied, &amp;c.</hi> As they
went back in the ſame Rank and File as they came,
the people meets them, and asks, <hi>What was done in
the buſſinſs.</hi> Then <hi>Mole</hi> nodding, ſignified <hi>all was
well.</hi> When one hot-headed Fellow flying out,
preſents his Sword to his breaſt, and bids him, <hi>Go
back again; Is this the ſetting</hi> Brouſſel <hi>at liberty?
Are our Requeſts thus diſappointed? Are you thus
returned without obtaining leave to do us any good?</hi>
Some of the Parliament men ſlipt away for fear:
<hi>Mole</hi> not at all affrighted, returns back again to the
Court, and preſſeth earneſtly, that the Priſoners
muſt be immediately releaſed, or elſe all given for
loſt.</p>
            <p>Upon ſo great a diſtraction, the Queen having
ſummoned her Counſel, inquires what Expedient
could be found in this ſo great difficulty. It is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
on both ſides by violent ſpeeches, that it
would be a dangerous ſeverity, or pernicious cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,
if either nothing, or if all were granted the
people: yet Reaſons being then weighed one againſt
the other, it was reſolved to ſet at liberty <hi>Blamme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
and <hi>Brouſſel</hi> at that time, the Darling of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people, and an empty ſhadow of their liberty.
The Parliament (a thing never before heard of)
being aſſembled in the Gallery of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:101520:65"/>
giving their Votes, Letters are written for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſing
<hi>Brouſſel</hi> and <hi>Blammeny;</hi> whereupon the
Rings Coaches are inſtantly lent to bring them
thither; of ſo great importance is the ſafety of the
State in extremity. [<hi>Mazarine</hi> who had ſtoutly
withſtood the former bad proceedings, did more
ſtoutly oppoſe theſe very low conceſſions. But
what could he do when affairs were in a condition
rolling down-hill? Warily he conſiders all things,
and looks forward upon the future. Maintains
the Honour of his Majeſty, as much as the irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the times and ill ſucceſs of buſineſs admit.]
The Sedition was a little pacified; yet they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to keep to their Arms out of a proud Bravado;
ſecretly giving out, as if there were ſome deſign
in the bottom. [Oh! how miſerable are thoſe
that live without the compaſs of Religion and Law!
what once they have deſerved, they always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.]</p>
            <p>That evening <hi>Blammeny</hi> returned: <hi>Brouſſel</hi> came
home the next morning with joyful acclamations,
to ſee his rejoycing Children and dear Friends.
From that day forward he lived as before, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
tenour of honeſt converſation, innocent in his
carriage: that heat of popular affection being
ſomewhat cold: one bounded within his rank. A
perſon of no ill deſign, over-born by the ſtream of
the Factious through the publick ſtorm, to run up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Shelves and Sands: [To teach poſterity how
vain and failing a ſtay it is, to lean upon ſuch Props
as will always be condemned, and continued to the
perpetual ruine both of high and low.]</p>
            <p>It was a ſhame for the King, in a manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaguer'd
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:101520:66"/>
to tarry any longer in the City. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Mazarine</hi> took care to have him conveyed to
<hi>Ruel,</hi> two miles out of Town, upon pretence of
taking the air. The Ring-leaders of the Sedition
fretted, and could not digeſt to have the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcued
from their fury. And now there began to
be a great alteration in the Rout: for after there
came certain news that ſuccours were coming,
which had been drawn out of <hi>Condes</hi> Army, and
were on the way marching thither haſtily, many
were frighted into their Wits again. Then they
began ſoberly to reflect how preſumptuouſly they
had carried themſelves againſt the King. An ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
ſeized them under this fright, that there
were now come thoſe who would call them to an
account for their high Treaſon. And this conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of ſpirit found grievous tokens of enſuing
miſery in all, even thoſe of the meaner ſort. What
increaſed theſe fears, was a wondrous cheerfulneſs
in <hi>Mazarine</hi> who had great aſſurance of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Forces.</p>
            <p>Here I firſt begun to be acquainted with divers
tranſactions as being employed in them (but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been carried away by the diſſenting Party, did
many things upon which I reflect with grief.) The
more credit ought to be given me who ſhall offer
to Poſterity nothing but what I have been an Eye
and Ear-Witneſs of, free from inclination to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
as from ill affection to the Governours.
Whatever hath been tranſacted in ſecret: and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
over with an artificial gloſs, as far as cometh
within the reach of my knowledge, I ſhall expoſe
to the open view of the noon-day light. The
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:101520:66"/>
Ages to come diſengaged from hope and fear, will
applaud the good, and hiſs out the contrary
actions.</p>
            <p>That ſo great a Body of the Mutineers ſhould
be ſhaken by ſo very few, was the ſport of Fortune.
<hi>Blammeny</hi> and <hi>Violet</hi> were then the principal Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
The injury of their late Impriſonment ſunk
deep into their ſpirits, and particularly the great
fall of their Uncle the Biſhop of <hi>Beavais.</hi> What
could Fortune have added to <hi>Violet?</hi> He had a
plentiful Eſtate, an honourable place in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
although he could not obtain the Office of
being the Queens Chancellor. Only that reſtleſs
ſpirit of his ſtrived to compaſs by means of the
troubles, what he could not preſume to hope for in
peaceable times.</p>
            <p>The firſt remarkable act of the retirement to
<hi>Ruel,</hi> was the impriſonment and baniſhment of
<hi>Chavigny.</hi> He was apprehended at <hi>Vincennes,</hi> and
conveyed over, through by-Lanes, and wild Foreſts
to <hi>Havre de Grace.</hi> There a ſtrict Watch attended
upon him when he was aſleep. This was hard to
one that had never been pinched with cares or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.
while he was yet ſcarce in the prime of
his youth, he had arrived at thoſe preferments,
which would have ſatisfied many men of great
Name to have held in their old age. For through
the high favour of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> during his time, he
run a race of unimpeached Honour. Uncapable of
ſuffering adverſity with patience, becauſe he bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not at the being conſcious of any former mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Thus miſſing thoſe reſpects that had been
conſtantly paid him, he was aſtoniſhed at the firſt
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:101520:67"/>
blow of Flortune, having fed himſelf with a ſtrong
conceit of being uppermoſt. He bears <hi>Mazarine</hi>
a ſpleen, and never leaves turning all things, till he
could overturn him. The Mutineers catch up a
new occaſion of complaining in publick, <hi>That Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
was perverted, and the Laws trampled upon in
the caſe of</hi> Chavigny: <hi>That no perſon might be held
in priſon, but for a certain ſpace of time, and that very
ſhort, without declaring his Crime, and having his
defence heard in the Houſe;</hi> ſuch new Ordinances,
and thoſe that follow. <hi>That Strangers ſhould be
removed from bearing Offices in the State: The op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
Provinces mull be eaſed, and</hi> Paris <hi>groaning
under the exceſſive burden of Taxes: the King <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

be brought home to his principal City.</hi> Theſe are the
chief Heads that were diverſly controverted, both
at <hi>Ruel</hi> and at S. <hi>Germains,</hi> between the Court and
Parliament, the Judgments ſometimes of <hi>Orleans,</hi>
ſometimes of <hi>Conde,</hi> leaning either this or that
way: upon ſecret ends, and that were ready to
burſt out into farther diſſenſions.</p>
            <p>Here begins a general ſtorm to gather over <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine,</hi>
againſt whom openly, as againſt a Rock,
the ſeditious Billows break their ſtrength. <hi>Orleans</hi>
ſteps in as Mediator between Court and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
He would make up the differences, yet was
heartily glad they were made; ſuppoſed by that
means to promote the Intereſts of the Abbot <hi>de Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieres,</hi>
that was deſigned for a Hat at <hi>Rome. Conde</hi>
returned from the Campagne, elated with his freſh
Victory, at firſt dealt roughly with the Senate; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
flattered their Leaders: entertained <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
moderate thoughts, pretended at leaſt to Conſtable,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:101520:67"/>
or Admiral. <hi>Longueville</hi> inſtigated his Brother in
Law, boaſting that he had obtained <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi>
the famous ſtrength of <hi>Normandy.</hi> Although in
truth there were no ſuch promiſe made him, yet

Archbiſhop of <hi>Corinth</hi> put <hi>Longueville</hi> on to ſuch
courſes upon a vain expectation: as if he ſhould
be declared by an Act of Parliament, <hi>Prince of the
Blood,</hi> as we call them. And becauſe what the
mind deſires, it is eaſie to perſwade it ſelf, ſhall
come to paſs. He cheriſhed ſuch vain dreams in

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his thoughts with a pleaſing credulity. <hi>Anne Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi>
the Wife of <hi>Longueville,</hi> was of great moment
to the Faction: ſhe carried along with her the
Archbiſhop of <hi>Corinth,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Retz,</hi> her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Conti,</hi> with <hi>Rochefoucault,</hi> who was then that
Ladies Cabinet-Counſellor. A Woman of a high
Spirit, and ſhrewd Wit, that could turn her Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
into a thouſand ſhapes: could not turn her
own violent inclinations. Turbulent without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage:
expecting nothing from the Confuſions,
bur the bare confuſions. She too pretended, <hi>the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and private Good, as the reſt did: that their Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
muſt be abated with Arms, who had put the
King upon cruel Counſels, and rendred the Princes
odious to him, and ſuſpected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amidſt theſe matters, the Queen having always
a ſmoother brow than publick ſtate of Affairs
did deſerve, ſeeth her ſelf manifeſtly ſtruck at
through the ſides of <hi>Mazarine.</hi> She compoſeth
her face to cheerfulneſs, recollecting her thought
how to provide for the future. She bridles her
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:101520:68"/>
grief, nor imparts the knowledge of it to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident.
The ſecret loftineſs of her ſpirit over
power'd her look: tempering her geſture and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
in a conflict between diſſimulation and a j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
the Mutineers. Nor was more dangerous plotting
in the Town, than in the Camp. Politickly taking
no notice of all this, he applied his mind to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
accommodation. Although he believed, <hi>that theſe
bold outrages are to be feared at the firſt heat, where
they have taken time, abate of themſelves: and as the
Faction grows ſtale, utterly fall. That when people are
glutted with perpetual new fancies, they always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the Reverence of their lawful Sovereign; and
is Repentance extorted from them, though againſt their
wills.</hi> Theſe and the like things being debated in
his mind, and ſeeing that the Grandees were ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affected to the Tumults; he thinks it not ſafe to
make uſe of hands, ſuſpected of prevarication, in
an Engagement that might ruine all. That there
were but a few about the King, and thoſe of ill-affected
and perverſe Judgments, that took indeed
this Party, but would fight on the oppoſite ſide, if
occaſion offered. This ſenſe of <hi>Mazarine</hi> was
diſliked by many underſtanding men, who were of
opinion, <hi>That the diſtreſs of the young King would be
a caſe raiſing the deteſtation of all Nations, whoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
can never be quiet, if their Subjects may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul
them in the choice of their Miniſters, or enſnare
them for their honeſty. Therefore it were better to
preſs cloſe upon the Faction now ſtartled: that loyal
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:101520:68"/>
Subjects have always fought with more courage for
their King, than others will for their evil deſign.
Mazarine</hi> adhered to his reſolution, that his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
ſhould return to the City, and their Propoſals
ſhould be granted: As though greater evils might
have bin feared, had he not yielded to be deceived.</p>
            <p>Here were it ſuperfluous to tranſcribe the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
ſet out in the publick Gazette. The ſubſtance
of them amounts to this, as I have already ſaid;
<hi>That many Taxes were to be abated in Towns and
Country, the Provinces were to be eaſed of them by
the Maſters of Requeſts; no man might be kept in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
above the ſpace of one natural day, without anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his charge in the Houſe:</hi> which was eagerly
diſputed, and approved even by the Court-party,
every one thinking his own private Concernment
lay in the Caſe. <hi>Chavigny</hi> is releaſed and turns
aſide to <hi>Tours:</hi> where looking down upon the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of the Court, as from the lofty Tower of a
contented mind, he applied his thoughts to the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of wiſdom: in which reſolution how long he
perſevered, the ſequel of the Story will declare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Frances de Lorraine,</hi> the Dutcheſs of <hi>Vandome,</hi>
exhibited a Petition in the behalf of her Husbands

            <p>Theſe matters being thus compoſed, about the

Faction not at all ſtruck with fear or grief for their
Riot, cannot abandon its unquiet diſpoſition: but
having got ſtrength, through his Majeſties Royal
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:101520:69"/>
Clemency, and the obtaining their Petitions, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now eſtabliſhed by Law, maketh the former
Conceſſions but a ſtep to higher Demands. The
Parliament not yet fully calmed, boiled up with
new deſigns. The ſtorm of Envy diſchargeth it
ſelf upon <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who in ſo ſuipicious a time,
jealous of every thing, did certainly look for great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Troubles. It is openly cryed out, <hi>That the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

muſt be laid to the root: the Stranger muſt be expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
out of the Kingdom:</hi> as though that were the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cure for the publick Diſtemper. Reverence every
day abated more than other, every body would
preſume to adviſe, and to be giving directions how
to govern the State. The confuſion of impolitick
Guides began to ſwell as high, as the rage of the
common People. Approaching danger might be
read in the faces of the Courtiers.</p>

way to vindicate his Sacred Majeſty: whatever
were the occaſion he frowned at the words that
were then thrown out againſt <hi>Mazarine. That
Fate was to be blamed, not</hi> Mazarine. <hi>He aimed
chiefly at the Kingdoms happineſs: nor did proudly
vaunt in ſo high a Fortune. Why ſhould it be matter
of offence to any, that the vertuous qualities of that
Eminent Stranger, might in their paſſage impart their
luſtre</hi> to France? <hi>That the Queen by order of her
deceaſed Husband, had taken him on to ſuſtain part of
her cares: ſeeing her own neck could not bear up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſuch a preſſing load, unleſs ſhe found out this aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
Nothing could be condemned in him, but his
happineſs. He did not ground any ſtrength upon Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons,
nor upon Caſtles: did not intereſt his Majeſties
Treaſure. That the Queen did not ſo much recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
his paſt fidelity with Honours and Gifts, as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
it for the future. That the King could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reproach abandon him to his Enemies, but might
maintain him with Honour and Conſcience, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any danger to his Eſtate. Mazarine</hi> anſwered
ſeveral times, <hi>That he would be gone, ſo that he were
neither way-laid nor aſſaulted. That he longed for
nothing more after ſo many obligations, than a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
departure.</hi> It began then to be questioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
ſome of the prime Nobility, which way he
might be moſt ſafely conveyed away, and in what
diſguiſe. A Lady of great Quality promiſed ſhe
would in the evening furniſh him with a Habit
proper to that purpoſe. But all theſe paſſages were
but ridiculous: for he never intended to go away:
nor if he had, was there need of any Mask or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:101520:70"/>
The Queen fearing to provoke the fierceneſs of

cleared <hi>Mazarine</hi> of all Cenſure; only doubted
this, leſt by his indulgence to the Grandees, he might
have expoſed his Dignity to contempt and injuries.
It was evident, that he had not occaſioned the
growing Troubles of <hi>France</hi> by any miſ-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or miſdemeanour of his. <hi>Mazarine</hi> at the
ſight of the raw and angry ſores of the Body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
always looking at the main chance and end,
took care that the Kingdom might be reſtored to
perfect and durable ſoundneſs: and upon the
breaking out afreſh of ſo many cicatrized boyls,
(having found in the malignant humor the ſtrength
of Fortune) relying upon his skill, never queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a proſperous iſſue by patience, gentle uſage, and

<hi>That the City ſhould be cloſe beſieged, and the Rebels

the Power againſt them. And leſt words ſhould
be rumoured by delay, that very day it was reſolved
in the <hi>Palais Royal</hi> to depart ſecretly, and at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
leave the City immerſed in wine and good
chear. Beſides the Queen and <hi>Mazarine, Orleans,
Coude, Meilleray, Villeroy, Grammont, Telleir,</hi> and
the Abbot of <hi>Rivieres</hi> agreed in this reſolve. <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
had given him in charge to convey away the
King, Queen, and the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> which he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
happily: for with his uſual Policy he eſcaped
the ſtrict Watches of the Faction at a Poſtern. <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi>
with <hi>Mazarine,</hi> was got clear by another by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Road.
At the midſt of <hi>Queens Courſe,</hi> on the way
to <hi>Chaliot,</hi> was the general <hi>Rendez-vous.</hi> Through
ſharp froſts and rugged ways, having travelled alt
the dark night, by break of day they arrive ſafe at
S. <hi>Germans. Conde</hi> tarried a little behind, to bring
off with him his Mother, Brother, and Siſter. His
Mother and <hi>Conti</hi> ſets forth in compliance with
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:101520:71"/>
him: the Dutcheſs of <hi>Longueville</hi> refuſed, alledging
for excuſe her fear of miſcarrying, in that ſhe was
near her time: but in truth keeping in mind the
engagement at the meeting of <hi>Noes,</hi> ſhe had far
other deſigns in her head. The Guards early in
the morning march out to overtake and wait upon
the King. Not a few Nobles go ſpeedily after,
whether out of Duty, or Policy. <hi>Orleans</hi> is made
General, <hi>du Pleſſis Praſlin</hi> takes up Quarters at
S. <hi>Denis,</hi> three miles out of the City. <hi>Grammont</hi> at
S. <hi>Clouds: Corbeil</hi> is immediately invaded. The
Queen rejoycing that all her deſigns, through the
Divine bleſſing ſucceeded, and that forces to take
her part, were coming up from every place, treats
<hi>Conde</hi> courteouſly in remembrance of his paſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
and the ſenſe of her preſent neceſſity, to make
uſe of him, doubling all expreſſions of kindneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him. Nor was he wanting to deſerve her
good word, behaving himſelf with all reverence to
the Queen in a becoming modeſty.</p>
            <p>In the Town of <hi>Poiſſie,</hi> and the neighbouring
places, a ſtrict prohibition is made, that no Victuals
ſhould be carried into the City. The Country
about <hi>Paris</hi> is made waſt by the rude Souldiers.
Hoſtility is acted openly; all dangers and ſhapes of
Fortune appear terrible. The City is frighted, leſt
taken in her actual Rebellion, ſhe ſhould ſuffer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne
puniſhment: they were conſtrained by fear,
that had not been wrought upon by favours. The
miſcarriage of a few threatning deſtruction to all,
whilſt puniſhment was inflicted upon the far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Body of the ſpreading Delinquency. By
the ſhortned ſupplies of one day, it was ſeen that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:101520:72"/>
mans life is ſuſtained by freſh meats: and Cities be
the bringing in proviſions from abroad. Troops
are in all parts levied. Raiſing Souldiers is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
upon Prieſts and Magiſtrates; nothing is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
from Contributions: the Authors of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
being but few, the conſequent deſtruction in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
all.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time the <hi>Seyne</hi> ſwelling upon Rains
and a ſudden Thaw, had overflowed the flat parts
of the City. Several houſes were born down, and
men drowned. That inundation was looked upon
as a Prodigy, as if the very Rivers aſſaulted <hi>Paris;</hi>
[Fools taking that which is Chance or Nature, for
Fate, or the Divine Wrath.]</p>
            <p>In the mean time ſpreading ſame had diſperſed
all abroad the News of the Cities calamity. The
moſt faithful Peers in their mutual Conference, did
not touch upon the wretchedneſs of the times. Her
Majeſty keeping all paſſages carefully in memory,
diſtinguiſhed from the reſt ſuch as were worthy for
her to truſt alone. The King by Letter to the <hi>Provoſt</hi>
of the <hi>Merchants</hi> (that is an Office at <hi>Paris</hi>) recites
curſorily the cauſes of his Retirement; <hi>the fickleneſs
of the Faction, Plots laid againſt his Perſon; and that
he could not with ſafety continue any longer in the
City. Orleans</hi> and <hi>Conde</hi> under their hand profeſs
themſelves to have been the Adviſers of the Kings
Retirement. The Parliament is charged by the
Kings Writ to adjourn to <hi>Montargie.</hi> The City
was affrighted at that, which is in a night of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
unleſs the King and Parliament ſhine upon
them. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Corinth</hi> ſummoned by
the Kings Letter, ſhews himſelf ready to obey.

Gets into his Coach, as if he were juſt upon quitting
the Town. The common people flock about him
offering to ſtop his Horſes by the reins. He had
before engaged the affections of all to him. The
throng was violently moved with earneſt paſſion
towards him. All kiſſed his Hand, or his Scarlet
Gown. He choſe rather to follow the Careſſes
land Applauſes of the common People, than the
Kings Commands. [In ſuch diſtreſs to attract the

            <p>
               <hi>Talor, Bignon,</hi> and <hi>Melian,</hi> which are called the
Kings Proctors in the Parliament, are ſent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
to his Majeſty. They come back again
without having Audience, or ſo much as being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into his Majeſties preſence. <hi>Conde</hi> chiefly
laboured it might be ſo: upon deſign to advance
his glory by the Troubles then in being. Such
things as were ſuitable to the preſent occaſion, were
conveyed to <hi>Paris.</hi> It is ſcarce credible, what a
plenty of all manner of proviſion flowed in: and
with what ſcarcity they ſtruggled in the Leagure
without. The Peaſants run any hazard, ſo they
may but ſuccour the beſieged. Every one had full
liberty to come in: all are ſtopped from going out
again; to the end ſure, that the Court might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
at ſo many pledges and relations. Several
perſons in diſguiſes ſlip away from the deſtruction
of the ruined City, for they expected no leſs. The
Kings Souldiers and Officers are by expreſs Act of
Parliament, prohibited from entring into Towns,
Cities, and Caſtles: they are to be repulſed from
all parts, as Enemies of their Country. A Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:101520:73"/>
is put out. <hi>That none ſhould relieve the</hi> Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riniſts
(<hi>ſo were the Royaliſts called) with Proviſion,
Arms, or other Ammunition: or if any ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
ſo to do, they ſhould be liable to the ſame pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
as Mazarine.</hi> An unreconcileable rage of
malice appeared upon this turn of Fighting or
Treating.</p>
            <p>A few days paſſed on after this rate, ſtill remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
by ſome new emergency. At length the
Thunder-clap broke over the head of <hi>Mazarine.,</hi>
He is voted in a full Houſe, <hi>guilty of high Treaſon,
and the Diſturber of the publick Peace. Every Age,
Condition, Sex is commanded to aſſault, ſhoot, or ſtab
him: whoever harboured him in the ſame houſe with
them, ſhould be guilty of the ſame Crime with him.</hi>
He comforted himſelf in the conſcience of his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
which can neither deſerve diſgrace, nor it was
ſhould happen, can ever be overthrown: but went
on in the practice of his former gentleneſs, with a
reſolution impaired by no violence: always ſo
putting up injuries, that he might be thought not
to have reſented them. Never did courage more
undauntedly perform her part, then in that, the
heighth of his Spirit diſowning to regard affronts,
nay or juſt fears. I am certainly informed, it was
the advice of ſome, that four or five of the prime
Ring-leaders of the Faction ſhould be executed:
and when they were taken off, that the reſt would
fall in pieces. <hi>Mazarine</hi> oppoſed; affirming that
the common people would contend more earneſtly
for avenging them, when they were dead, than to
advance their Honour whilſt they were alive.</p>
            <p>Here they declare in a great Train, that would
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:101520:73"/>
take the Parliaments part. Firſt <hi>Elbaeuf</hi> ſlips from
the Court, and relying on his three Children, offers
the Parliament his Service: not without good
hopes, as he gave out, to draw the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi>
into his party: which device ſoon after came to
nothing. <hi>Bouillon,</hi> laying off his Mask, with a
voice pretending to truth, ſwears to be at the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
devotion, preſents his Wife and Children
as Hoſtages to be ſureties for that word, which was
never certain. So much could <hi>Madame de Longue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
prevail, that ſhe brought over to the Party her
Brother <hi>Conti,</hi> her Husband, with <hi>Rochefoucault,</hi>
and <hi>Mermont,</hi> though to her great danger. The
people triumphed in mirth for the coming of ſo
many Grandees. The Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> was
fretted at the Honour ſo haſtily done <hi>d'Elboeuf</hi> in
the Parliament: and at that very moment, thought
of his Government of <hi>Normandy,</hi> whither he reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
ſhortly after, having made many fair offers of
ſervices; only with a deſign of getting ſomewhat
from the King: and left off to ſtickle for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
which he never followed with any earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
None was more eaſily drawn to take up a
Party: none did with leſs regret lay it down again.
<hi>Beaufort,</hi> who had eſcaped being impriſoned by
keeping ſecret, rides into the Town on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back:
with ſo great applauſe, that the common
People run along by his ſide, as once they flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
after the Duke of <hi>Guiſe. Mareſchal de la Motte,</hi>
either through the inſtigation of the Duke of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueville,</hi>
to whom he was much obliged; or
through the memory of his Impriſonment at <hi>Lyons,</hi>
joyned with the Faction. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:101520:74"/>
was more powerful than any of them in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents,

followed that inclination, which is the moſt ſweet
in Nature: her modeſty always ſurvived her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
though Fame was not afraid to be lye her;
which ſhe afterwards enjoyed unſtained to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing

               </gap>
came from the one and the other ſide forward and
backward to treat of an Accommodation. Again
troubleſom Conteſts were renewed: ſome were of

longer haraſſing. In the City came out divers Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
againſt <hi>Mazarine.</hi> In the Court men did not
confute thoſe reproaches with words, but blows.</p>
            <p>The face of preparations on both ſides were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalled
matched. Here were a throng hudled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and new-raiſed Forces. All full of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
mens looks either fearing or deſigning ſome
barbarous attempt. Deſpair hurried them into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions
of horrour, whilſt they reflected upon the
obſcurity of their Souldiery. Far other was the
appearance of the Royal Camp. Majeſty, the
Cauſe, ſo many Princes, ſo many Dukes Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
with more warrantable Commiſſions gained

reverence. Great hopes in <hi>Conde,</hi> as one renowned
for Martial experience, and not inferiour in Wit,
being come to maturity in prudence for counſel,
did advance the reputation of the Royal Party by
the Excellency of his Name. Intent upon every
imployment, even the meaneſt, laid claim to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of his high Birth, but his Spirit; hazarding
his perſon for the publick ſafety. The Mutineers
thought they could carry all with more eaſe, if he
were taken off, or withdrawn. His Siſter the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs
of <hi>Longueville</hi> within the Town, was as active
and couragious as her Brother in the oppoſite part.
She renders herſelf in the Parliament Houſe, and
her Boy born in the troubles newly dropt into the
world, as pledges of her faithfulneſs. Preſently
reſtoring a countenance to the party, which her
pangs, whilſt ſhe was in labour, had ſwallowed up.
The Officers and common Souldiers ſtood promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuouſly

artificially diſpenſes her ſmiles and glances, that no
one in that great confluence might think himſelf
neglected or diſregarded. Their ſpirits broken
with the publick Confuſions, yet did not deſiſt from
a ſtubborn defence. In the mean time the <hi>Baſtille</hi>

ſuit their induſtry to any courſe of life; and have
parts not tranſcendent, but to whatſoever imployment
they turn themſelves indifferent. There is no where
a greater readineſs to put up injuries, ſo they may be
ſecured from want, and have the leaſt glimmering hope
of advantage. The Nobility burdened with numerous
Dependents, cannot long maintain its State in a-like
Equipage; therefore it is greedy after Changes, but
ſuch as may prove beneficial. The Neighbourhood of

They were ſcarce come to <hi>Irviz,</hi> four

ſome lurk in holes, many ſlink away ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Theſe halted behind their fellow-Souldiers;
others drew them on. They kept neither Rank
nor File, but ſtraggled all abroad. Sometimes they
went to the City, the fartheſt way about; anon in

voices ſurfeited by exceſs; and the hoarſe drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the tippling Rout interrupted the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

Your Majeſty ſent us a Herald to try our Allegiance

We had not ſo far forgot our ſelves, as to ſtand upon

If you range us in co-ordination with them, we have
reaſon to deſire herein to be excuſed and diſclaim an
Honour above our Rank, affecting only the glory of
Loyality, and having no higher pretences than of being
dutiful. If we have done amiſs, we ſubmit, condemn

taking advantage of <hi>Charles</hi> his temper, and of the
weakneſſes and errours in the Government, poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and corrupts all the parts of the Kingdom.
Hereupon Phrenſie and Ambition take up Arms
againſt the King, and when he was brought low,
lay violent hands upon him. The King awakned
too late, began to aſſert his Honour and Cauſe, but
was now debarred of his Liberty; a Prince for
Gallanty of Spirit inferior to no King; and that
could not have been over-reached but by his exceſs
of Goodneſs; was driven by the Villany of others
to exert his own Vertues. <hi>Cromwell,</hi> a Perſon bold,
and of a deep reach, that had fair words at will to
carry on his own deſigns, ſecond to no man living
in Cruelty and Pride, whenſoever he might exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe

by Fate, or the corruption of the Times, that upon
the Scaffold (as is notorious to all) King <hi>Charles</hi> in
a pretended form of Law, by Sentence of a High
Court of Juſtice, in the view of his Subjects, had
his Head cut off, by the wicked hand of the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
Thus much by the by, becauſe I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

Army, ſcarcely eſcaped with his life, diſcompoſed
with the ill ſucceſs of his undertakings. Hereupon
turning aſide into by-ways, with a ſmall Retinue,
he bore the puniſhment of his indigeſted Plot. One

ſeeming reſpect towards <hi>Mazarine. Beaufort,</hi> the
Head of the <hi>Slingers</hi> in the Town, delighted in the
popular Applauſe. The Duke of <hi>Vendoſme, and
Mercoeur</hi> his eldeſt Son, being tired out with trouble
that had lain long and heavy upon them, avowed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
courted the Favour and Alliance of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> as
the only remedy of their diſtreſſed eſtate. The
Dutcheſs of <hi>Mancini</hi> his Niece, occaſioned this
diſturbance, whilſt ſome were for the matching her
with <hi>Mercoeur,</hi> others drew againſt it. From hence
came that ſeed, which afterwards grew into a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
crop of troubles. <hi>Mazarine</hi> perceiving the
affections of all Parties ſo unſound towards him
was reſolved to confirm his intereſt by ſome potent
Alliance; and that the rather, becauſe the Queens
pleaſure ſtood that way inclined. Here it was
judged fit to advance in Offices and Wealth <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coeur,</hi>
that firſt offered himſelf, being of the Blood
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:101520:84"/>
Royal. The Queen was at the preſent inverted in
the Admiralty, ever ſince the death of <hi>Breze,</hi> for
the avoiding of quarrels between the Competitors.
She is content to deveſt her ſelf of that, in favour of
the Match; whether the charge were beſtowed on
<hi>Vendoſme,</hi> or his Son <hi>Mercoeur. Beaufort</hi> the more to
endear himſelf to the people, decrys the purpoſe of
both the Father, and his eldeſt Son: the Father was
glad that he had a double ſupport in his two Sons.
The Abbot <hi>de la Rivieres</hi> prevailed upon <hi>Orleans</hi> to
give his conſent to the Match; whereupon <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>
carrieth it on with the confidence; ſuppoſing
too that he had been ſure of <hi>Conde.</hi> For he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
that without asking his conſent, much leſs
in deſpight of him, he might not once aſpire to
that Match with young <hi>Mercoeur:</hi> nay, without
<hi>Beanſorts</hi> conſent, he refuſed to proceed any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that ſo he might curb his youthful ſpirits apt
to flye out, and might carry off from the Mutineers
one of their great Supporters. He had no other
deſign in matching his Nieces, but that of the
<hi>French:</hi> and did it more to advance the publick
Peace, than his private Fortunes; ſince he might
have had better offers at <hi>Rome,</hi> or in <hi>Italy,</hi> than in
<hi>France. Conde</hi> did for ſome time demur before he
would openly declare his Judgment. Not a few
perſons, rather imported by their own paſſions,
than tender of the Princes Honour, did ſpur him on
day and night, adviſing him not to let Fortune,
which now offered it ſelf ſo fairly to him, ſlip out
of his hands, and had rather have all things again
thrown into confuſion, than that he ſhould reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
in an offer of certain quietneſs: nor were

there Flatterers wanting, who would have puſhed
his generous mind and ſpirit, raiſed up in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of great preferment, but unwary of bad Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices,
to purſue fairer hopes. The general diſtant
of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> and indignation of being enthralled
to a Foreigners Uſurpation, got him many friends
The Duke <hi>de Bouillon</hi> and <hi>Chavigny</hi> were the chief:

the licentiouſneſs of ſo many dangerous Pamphlets
<hi>Orleans</hi> is moſt inſtantly requeſted, that his Majeſty
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:101520:85"/>
might be induced to return with all convenient
ſpeed to his Capital City, that this Article was of
indiſpenſable neceſſity to preſerve the publick quiet,
and the earneſt prayer of all the honeſt party. <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>
could not digeſt that his Majeſty ſhould abide
there, where at the turning of the tide, the waves of
the late Sedition did yet roll.</p>
            <p>At that time <hi>Mareſchal d'Hoquincourt,</hi> under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
that a Plot had been laid for him in the Camp,
of a ſudden withdraws himſelf from the imminent
danger, as he pretended; and keeping cloſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>Peronne,</hi> gave ſome <hi>umbrage,</hi> as though he had
been wavering. <hi>Mazarine</hi> had thoughts of the
Government of <hi>Picardy;</hi> but whether he could not
agree with <hi>d'Elboeuf</hi> about the price, or whether he
were uncertain of gaining himſelf the fortified
Towns in that Country, waving that intention, he
thought upon ſome others. Now ſuch a value he
had for <hi>Hoquincourt,</hi> that he declared himſelf to
have an ambition for his friendſhip. Both on a
certain day meet at an appointed place: and as if
they had been to engage in a Duel, are both attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with an equal number of Souldiers. There
were ſtrict Articles agreed on, which held for ſome
time, but afterwards the agreement broke, and they
fell into extreme diſſenſions.</p>
            <p>During this time the Army growing ſoft by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe
of Action, and pillaging the Country where it
lay idle, it was reſolved ſpeedily to put them upon
ſome conſiderable imployment; to the end both
of giving the Enemy terrour, and getting them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
amidſt the Rebels. The Kings Counſel
were divided about the matter of the Expedition.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:101520:86"/>
Some adviſed <hi>Doway;</hi> others <hi>Aviennes. Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>
preſſed that <hi>Cambray</hi> rather than any ſhould be
attaqued, having at that time but 500 men in Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,
as certain information had been brought. It
is a Frontier Town upon the Border of <hi>France,</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
in a manner a Free-State, but Homager to the
<hi>Empire;</hi> ruled by its <hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> under certain
Laws: ſtanding on the right ſide of the <hi>Scaldy or
Eſcault.</hi> A City eyed jealouſly, as being of great
moment to which ſide ſoever it belongs. The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralſhip
is proffered to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> upon
his refuſal <hi>Harcourt</hi> accepts it: who beleaguers
<hi>Cambray,</hi> but without any effect; for upon the
conveying in of ſuccours, one night in a fog by the
negligence of the Sentinels, the Siege was raiſed
before it was well laid; at which the Faction laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and not a few of the Courtiers were well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
<hi>Mazarine</hi> was thought to have taken up that
reſolution, that he might have made the Town his
own, after it had been taken. So had it been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
granted <hi>Balagny,</hi> and having been loſt by his
negligence, is at this day held by the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in
right of Conqueſt.</p>
            <p>Amidſt theſe Affairs, the War not being cloſely
purſued, Convoys paſt freely on all parts. The
Courtiers ſpend their time in Feaſts, and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one another. And becauſe there is no chear
without it be made in <hi>Paris,</hi> thither <hi>Jarcey, Jerzy,
San-Megrin,</hi> and divers others poſte up. Theſe
being at Supper with <hi>Candale</hi> at <hi>Renards</hi> were very
merry, when of a ſudden <hi>Beaufort</hi> comes in upon
them, as they were in their Jollity, and gives <hi>Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zey</hi>
threatning language (nay ſome ſay farther, that
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:101520:86"/>
he baſtonado'd him.) The Company diſſolves;
the Board is tumbled down; you would have
thought it the Fray of the, <hi>Lapithae.</hi> It was given
out, that the matter could no ways be made up, but
in a fair Duel. But after the <hi>French</hi> wont, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the quarrel is hot, but the end flags, their
tempers being eaſily wrought upon. Much Broth
was ſpilt on the Table-cloth, but no blood-ſhed,
and after ſuch a ſharp bickering, all preſently were
made very good friends.</p>
            <p>Two things did moſt afflict <hi>Mazarine;</hi> the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
attempt upon <hi>Cambray,</hi> and the Borders laid
waſte by Free-quarters, where a general dearth was
very ſore. Then to delude melancholy, he goes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>French</hi> Camp, accompanied with the chief
of the Courtiers, as though he would treat with
<hi>Pignoranda</hi> at <hi>Valenciennes</hi> about Peace. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible,
with what Art, Eloquence, and ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Language he aſſwaged the moſt unruly; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
the <hi>Alemans</hi> whom he promiſed, and at
length gave leave to make an Incurſion into the
Enemies Country. All parts were there laid waſte,
to no leſs damage, than terrour; the Cattel driven:
the Souldier ſatisfied. <hi>Harcourt,</hi> that he might
not be thought to have done nothing all that <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne</hi>
ſtorms <hi>Conde,</hi> a Town ſituated in a Plain on
the <hi>Scheldt,</hi> and the <hi>Aon. Mazarine</hi> returns to
<hi>Compiegne;</hi> where the Prince is reported to have
uſed many arguments to perſwade the <hi>Queen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,</hi>
That <hi>his Majeſty could not be kept any longer out
of the City; that many evil conſequences would come
upon it,</hi> which muſt all be imputed to the <hi>male-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration</hi>
of <hi>Mazarine. Orleans</hi> came over to

give the ſame advice. Both of them joyntly were
not as before when ſeveral, ſubmiſſive, but impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
<hi>Orleans</hi> as the Kings Uncle, bearing great
ſway. In <hi>Conde</hi> reſided the ſupreme Command
and Glory of the Martial Power. Therefore it
was concluded the better courſe to comply with
their advice, thaw by drawing <hi>Counter,</hi> to give the
Faction advantage.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>Auguſt</hi> 16. in the year 1649. his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
is welcomed into the City. His Entry was
remarkable for all expreſſions of joy. The City in
great Companies went out to meet him: all the
adjacent Country rung with acclamations: Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires
burnt all night: and drunken Revellings were
held in the ſeveral quarters. The King ſitting in
the one Boot of the Coach, between his Uncle and
Brother, was pleaſed with the Applauſes of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
in the oppoſite, <hi>Conde</hi> had by his ſide Cardinal
<hi>Mazarine,</hi> who ſate as the multitude ſcouled
upon him, all the while undaunted. The Queen
Regent, with the eldeſt Daughter of the Duke of
<hi>Orleans,</hi> and the Mother of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> ſate
in the end of the Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch. The more ample Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Majeſties proceeding may be fetched from
divers Records: what is ſufficient for an Hiſtory, I
have delivered; for I neither write Journals not
<hi>Gazettes.</hi> The face of the City was then cheerful,
all perſons returning to the obedience of their Liege
Lord. No longer did the Military right prevail
to the contempt of the Magiſtrate. On S. <hi>Louys</hi> his
day, the King attended by a great number of Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
rode through the City on Horſe-back, that he
might gratifie his Subjects longing to ſee him, all
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:101520:87"/>
all the way from the <hi>Louvre</hi> to the Church of
S. <hi>Louys.</hi> A little before him, <hi>Mazarine</hi> had gone
thither in a Coach without any Attendants
though the high Streets: diſcovering not any ſign
of fear, though he had received ſeveral Advices not
to ſtir forth. Guarded by his conſcience, and the
favour of his Prince, he dreaded no vain brutes, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing
in the affections of the honeſt party with
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> better Train: hated of none, but ſuch as rejoyced
at the publick miſery, and thinking they ſhould
thereby eſcaped puniſhment, laid the foundations of
repairing their private fortunes in the common
Delinquency. Which State-Policy of theirs, the
iſſue afterwards declared.</p>
            <p>The Treaty of Marriage with the Duke <hi>de Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ur,</hi>
that had been intermitted during this appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of publick Accommodation, began to be ſet a
foot afreſh. The Son compliant to his Fathers
pleaſure, would voluntarily quit the Admiralſhip,
ſo that at the deceaſe of his Father, the charge
might devolve upon him. But the Match is again
diſturbed, becauſe <hi>Mazarine</hi> was unwilling to have
it concluded againſt <hi>Condes</hi> will. <hi>Right and reaſon
might permit that</hi> Conde, <hi>the ſole Heir of</hi> Breze,
<hi>ſhould be promoted to all the advantages of his Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
at leaſt that the Father of</hi> Breze, <hi>Mareſchal of</hi>
France, <hi>no contemptible man, ſhould ſucceed his decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Son, for the conſolation of his childleſs condition.</hi>
Theſe things were commonly given out but in an
unſeaſonable time. All this while <hi>Beaufort</hi> doth
not give off ſiding with the diſaffected party; yet
comes to Court, waits upon his Majeſty, pays there
his duty, but never offers to viſit <hi>Mazarine.</hi> The
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:101520:88"/>
Queen teſtified how ill ſhe took that, by her cold
reception of him: which again turned to his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
with the party. AH the talk is, <hi>That whil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>,
everyone looks after his private concern, no body minds
the Publick Good. Mazarine</hi> to no effect tryes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
means of winning over the Youths ſpirit to
eſpouſe his party, even by the perſwaſion of both
his Parents. He haughtily rejects all, chuſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to gratifie the pleaſure of Madam <hi>Mombazon,</hi>
with whoſe eyes he was enthralled. Such influence
had a Miſtreſs! He thought himſelf ſufficiently
happy, ſo he were but cryed up for a brave <hi>Slinger,</hi>
no <hi>Mazariniſt</hi> (thus were the <hi>Royaliſts</hi> nick-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.)
In the City mens minds ſtood diverſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.
All Politicians, and that were Maſters in
Court-craft, preſaged ſome great alteration in the
State. And becauſe <hi>Mazarines</hi> power was at that
time moſt reſtrained, he was forced to give way to
comply with plauſible ſhadows of reaſon, rather
than adhere to ſolid connſels. Many were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by diſcontent, becauſe they thought they
were not rewarded proportionably to their merits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
All exceſs is venial in a multitude of Delinquents
amidſt Tumults that miniſter confidence.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time <hi>Michael Particelli</hi> L. of
<hi>Emeri,</hi> that had been turned out of the Treaſurers
place, was reſtored again to his Office; but the
eſpecial meditation of <hi>Conde;</hi> whether it were to
ſhew his greatneſs, or to procure matter of new
Tumults, or in remembrance of friendly offices for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
performed him, or upon expectation of any
to be performed him hereafter. Many in their
Speeches in the Parliament inveighed againſt the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:101520:88"/>
former life of <hi>Emeri,</hi> ſaying: <hi>Pimps and Paraſites,
Fiddlers and Strumpets were no proper inſtruments
for a Miniſter of State: but that perſons of lewd and
d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in Peace, deteſtable to all honeſt men; and
procured nothing but calamity and deſtruction.</hi> Now
the Houſe of <hi>Emeri</hi> ſtill roared with ſuch ſinks of
looſneſs. This reſtored charge was fruitleſs to
<hi>Conde,</hi> deſtructive to <hi>Emeri,</hi> comfortable to neither.
For beſides that <hi>Particelli</hi> having loſt his good
parts, was now ſunk in ſottiſhneſs, being reſtored
to his place, he had his mind diſſolved, and his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
enervated with the inveigling allurements of
pleaſure; ſo that he cloſed his loathed Miniſtry,
and looſe life with a miſerable Cataſtrophe. As if
the Royal Treaſure had ſome infection of luſt; ſo
that the Venereal diſtemper were fatal to all Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers.</p>
            <p>Now the ſame Malignancy raged with an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical
Contagion all over <hi>Provence</hi> and <hi>Guyenne.</hi>
In <hi>Provence</hi> this was the ſtate of Affairs. It was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
for a new deſign of getting mony to increaſe
a Parliament at <hi>Aix,</hi> with new Counſellors that
were to divide the Juriſdiction, every ſix months,
for a certain ſum, which every one was to give.
This was highly offenſive to the old Members, to
have their Authority thus divided, and of perpetual
made temporary. From hence was the ſource of
the Troubles, which ſpringing from a ſmall riſe,
prevailed almoſt to the deſtruction of the Province.
The Inſtructions from Court were: <hi>That way muſt
be given to the popular fury: That the Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
ſtill gains by delay; but the ill Plots of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:101520:89"/>
are always defeated by time: That the Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of limiting the Authority to ſix months, for a
while ſhould be kept under Deck; the Mutineers
ſhould in due ſeaſon be puniſhed: In the execution of
all this, there muſt be a fair carriage and ſecre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>.</hi>
Theſe private Articles are committed to the ſingle
fidelity of the Governor, who not being able to
keep counſel, imparts his Majeſties Inſtructions to
one, and then another, and they to more; ſo by
ſpreading farther, the myſtery was revealed: for
which openneſs the Count <hi>d'Ales</hi> afterward ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſeverely. For of a ſudden the Faction takes
fire, and that Parliament votes againſt <hi>Mazari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>;</hi>
as plotting the ruine of the Province: it joyns with
the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> that <hi>Mazarine</hi> muſt be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed;
the Count <hi>d'Ales</hi> turned out of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
and ſuch other particulars as their fury
did dictate. The Count <hi>d'Ales</hi> doth not conceal
his reſentments, but breathing out revenge, gives
order that the <hi>Nobleſſe</hi> which were his friends, and
all his Creatures ſhould take up Arms; caſts ſome
of the Mutineers in priſon, without conſidering,
<hi>That he ſhould not have diſobliged thoſe, whom he
could not deſtroy.</hi> Farther, upon a conteſt, one of
the Parliaments Meſſengers was killed by a Souldier
of the Governors. Hereupon the Tumult ſwelled,
eſpecially becauſe upon a Holy-day, when they
were going in Proceſſion to S. <hi>Sebaſtians,</hi> which
ſtands without the Town, a Peaſant cryed out,
that the City-gates were a ſhutting, to keep the
Burgers out from returning to their houſes. The
Count <hi>d'Ales</hi> with 5000 Foot, and 500 Horſe, and
no ſmall number of the Gentry, aſſaults and takes

the neighbouring Towns. At length draws up to
<hi>Aix,</hi> and of 200 that ſallied out, a Piquering cuts

and Amneſty for what hath paſt is ſeaſonably
offered; and an Agreement being made, every one
returns to his wonted imployment; and the ſix
months grievance is aboliſhed for ever. Thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
obſtructions of the publick Peace, through the
diſcontents of <hi>Provence,</hi> were removed by the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Conduct of <hi>Mazarine:</hi> much againſt the
ſtrain of <hi>Noſtradamus</hi> his Prophecies, who by the
contrary event is convicted to have given lying
predictions to his Country-men. [This Impoſtor

the madneſs of credulous men, that they ſtick not

            <p>But the Star of the <hi>Bourdelois</hi> did ſtrangely ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolize

Hoſtility is acted on both ſides. <hi>D' Eſpernon muſt

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi>
who bore in mind his Predeceſſors that had

cheriſh the commotions, particularly in <hi>Bourdeaux<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
and aimed at bringing the Queen Regent at length
to that paſs, as to renouunce <hi>Mazarine,</hi> and take in
either himſelf or <hi>Chaſteaunoeuf</hi> to the prime Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.</p>
            <p>In the mean while poor <hi>Guyenne,</hi> always averſe
from quiet courſes, was torn with inteſtine rage.
Nor did the violence of diſpleaſure againſt <hi>Eſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
abate. They fell one upon another with all
extremity; and the Kings Souldiers plundered the
neighbouring Towns, as if it had been the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
or Enemies Country. The <hi>Bourdelois</hi> would
reſtrain them from pillaging, and ſometimes pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
themſelves: they engaged oftentimes with
ſucceſs, always couragiouſly, although the giddy
multitude had divers Leaders. How tough the
hatred was, you may learn by this, that the Peaſants
upon the places adjacent to the City, beſieged in
their Caſtles, choſe rather to be burnt alive, than to
come by Surrender into the hands of the Royaliſts.
Whoſover from a moderate principle bethought
themſelves how great a crime was acted, were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:101520:92"/>
Enemies of the State, and baniſhed out of
Town. Letters from the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
ſeeds of War, who promiſed all help to the
Aſſembly of the Parliament of <hi>Bourdeaux. Tholouſe</hi>
that was ever unſpotted with treaſonable deſigns,
being invited to an Union, ſtoutly denied, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
its utmoſt ſervice to appear as an Interceder
in procuring a Pacification; and that by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
too of <hi>Candale.</hi> But all this was fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs:
nor was it eaſie to part men deſirous to fight,
and vaunting the ſtrength of their Party. Nor
did they any longer conteſt with Declarations, but
came to blows. <hi>Argenſon</hi> is ſent thither to treat as
Commiſſioner, who after divers endeavours, when
he thought he had brought all into ſafe Harbour,
was driven back by new billows again into the
open Sea. I will not be prolix, nor dwell any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
upon this Whirlpool of Sedition, whenas very
many have delivered theſe things out of vanity in
too tedious repetitions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argenſon</hi> firſt went to viſit <hi>Eſpernon</hi> at <hi>Cardillac</hi>
(a pleaſant Seat of the <hi>Eſpernons</hi>) though <hi>Bourdeaux</hi>
was not well pleaſed at his ſo doing. There what
was ſaid in Conference, was to this purpoſe: <hi>That
he muſt relieve the Garriſon at</hi> Trompet <hi>with provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
which they ſtood in much need of.</hi> [The <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delois</hi>
had ſo cloſely blocked it up, that nothing
could be conveyed into it.] <hi>That the Fort begun
at</hi> Libourne <hi>muſt be compleated;</hi> from thence
ſprung the Revolt, and all thoſe troubles that enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
were upon that occaſion. <hi>Argenſon</hi> paſſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the hoſtile Troops on the one ſide and the
other begged of them both, <hi>to return home, nor to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:101520:93"/>
cruſh the hopeful beginnings of compoſing matters with
too haſty counſels.</hi> They promiſe, <hi>they will obey his
Majeſties Commands;</hi> Eſpernon <hi>declared he required
nothing but the ſettlement of the Country.</hi> Not a
word of all which was true. Yet by the conſent
of both Parties, theſe Articles were ſigned. <hi>Neither
Party to revenge paſt wrong: neither to inſtigate their
followers to fight; neither adviſedly to violate the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Peace; no Quarrels to be permitted between
the Townſmen and Souldiers, which ordinarily break
out againſt the will of their Superiors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Bourdelois</hi> grown more moderate, kept
within the terms preſcribed, and, according to
agreement, Meal was conveyed into the Garriſon at
<hi>Trompette. Eſpernon</hi> thought he had well ordered
the preſent ſtate of Affairs, ſo that the Caſtle of
<hi>Trompette</hi> were preſerved from taking, and the Fort
at <hi>Libourne</hi> were built up to curb the <hi>Bourdelois.</hi>
Therefore he ſees that the Work be haſtened for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
a Garriſon, and two great Guns, with ſtore
of Powder and Bullet be put in. Whereupon the
violence of the Faction which was abating, broke
out af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſh. Nor did <hi>Argenſon</hi> eſcape cenſure, being
openly cryed out againſt, as one of <hi>Eſpernons</hi> party,
and an Enemy of <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> Never were Spirits
more embittered. This is obſervable, that as in
the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> the worſhipful old men
were carried away with the ſtream of the young;
ſo on the contrary in that of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> the Elders
in the Aſſembly hurried away the Youth, implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ill principles in them. <hi>Eſpernon</hi> having now
ſet the Caſtle of <hi>Trompette</hi> in ſafety, which was relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with Proviſion, ſupported the courage of his
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:101520:93"/>
Followers with ſmall pay, but great promiſes. Nor
ſeemed he ſo much to aim that the King ſhould
conquer, as that himſelf might not be conquered,
reſolving to ſtand to no Articles; but with an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
pride, plotted ſecret means of revenge.
There is no doubt but the Peace had been then firm,
had not he been unſtedfaſt in his promiſe.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Argenſon</hi> and his Son fell into
manifeſt danger from the common People; the
Archbiſhop in vain labouring to appeaſe them: out
of whoſe houſe, as not being ſafe, he went and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red
himſelf in the Garriſon of <hi>Ha,</hi> an old Caſtle,
either to avoid violence, or to put himſelf there as
an Hoſtage. However the matter were, there was
he obliged to write a Letter to the Governor of
<hi>Libourne,</hi> wherein he was required <hi>to demoliſh that
building which gave cauſe of jealouſie.</hi> Though <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſon</hi>
knew this would be ineffectual, as he had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to believe; having no authority over the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
of <hi>Libourne;</hi> yet he did it to pacifie the
Sedition, for a ſmall ſpace ſtilling with a temporary
remedy that anger which would break out more
violently. The Son of <hi>Argenſon</hi> rides to <hi>Libourne,</hi>
carrying with him his Fathers Orders, which were
not obeyed. But <hi>Argenſon</hi> by ſome means or other
getting free, prefently waited on <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to do his endeavour, that the Sconce at <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourme</hi>
might ſpeedily be razed to the ground.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Bourdelois</hi> not brooking any delay, nor much
confiding on the word of <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> levying freſh
Forces, draw up again in Arms; and lead out of
the City all the ſtrength they could draw together,
to make the greater appearance. I find there were
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:101520:94"/>
7000 men in Arms ſet in array in the field. They
march towards <hi>Libourne;</hi> and encamp not far from
the Town, without raiſing any Works.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eſpernon</hi> rejoycing that he had a deſired oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of giving Battel to the Faction, no longer
ſhelter'd within Walls, but expoſed in vaſt Plain;
directly leads the Kings Souldiers and his own Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
with the band of the Gentry againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels.
At firſt there were light Skirmiſhes engaged
with variety of Fortune. The valour of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
made for <hi>Eſpernon</hi> the number for the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineers,
which could not carry it. For upon a charge
made after the Rules of Martial Diſcipline; the
Companies of new-raiſed Souldiers were routed,
and put to flight. Some ſlain; others ſwallowed
up in the gulf of the <hi>Dordonne.</hi> Their Leader
<hi>Chambaret</hi> ſighting ſtoutly, died; the Priſoners
were brought to <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> who not riſing his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
with ſufficient moderation, grew much ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
in his ſpirit: and drawing towards <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi>
made a halt at <hi>Grave,</hi> two miles off the
Town. There the Archbiſhop and certain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
of the Town treated with him in fair
terms of Application, about the ſubmiſſion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of the Town, to which he was invited.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eſpernon</hi> through the great perſwaſions of <hi>Argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
reſolves to enter the City, ſo he might have a
reception ſuitable to his Dignity. The Burgers
agree to it: not the Parliament, which always
ſtood off from any treating with <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe.
Therefore the Barricadoes of the Streets being
taken away, and <hi>Luſigniac,</hi> who ſupplied the place
of <hi>Chambaret</hi> lately ſlain, being turned out of the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:101520:94"/>
Town with his Souldiers, <hi>Eſpernon</hi> finds all things
at his diſpoſal. No where did ever appear more
evident hopes of compoſing differences. They
ſeemed mutually to blame their diſaſter, which had
induced ſuch a neceſſity of miſunderſtanding.
<hi>Eſpernon</hi> having ſpent but few days at <hi>Bourdeaux</hi>
with a ſhew of reconciliation, retired to <hi>Cadillac,</hi>
meditating rather revenge, than to be quiet. But
had he longer continued in perſon with them that
were froward, yet ſo as they might have been
brought over with fair uſage; they would all have
come into their obedience. But as much of thoſe
miſchiefs is to be imputed to the unquiet diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the people, ſo more to the arrogancy of
<hi>Eſpernon:</hi> into whoſe receſſes the Faction prying,
could eaſily diſcover a bottom, ulcerated with ſtudy
of revenge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eſpernon</hi> being out of the reach of the ſtorms at
<hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> diſpatched <hi>Argenſon</hi> the Son to the
Court, which was then at <hi>Amiens,</hi> that he might at
large relate the whole matter to get the people par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned;
but the Parliament ſuſpended. Whilſt
this is ſix months debating in the Privy Council,
the Faction gathers ſtrength by delay. [Theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
paſt Ages it hath been obſerved, that amongſt the
<hi>French</hi> beneficial Counſels are ſlow, but hurtful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
quick in their diſpatch.] The Court re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
at the ſucceſſes of <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> willingly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
his advice, and ſends <hi>Guitald Cominges</hi> with
two Purſuivants, wearing the Badge of a Chain,
that in the Kings Name ſhould ſuſpend the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> from all Juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eſpernon, Argenſon,</hi> and <hi>Guitald</hi> enter the Palace,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:101520:95"/>
keeping cloſe to themſelves the matter about which
they came. But as the mind of the Faction was
watchful, they thought that to be which they fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
would be, and eaſily perceived the matter.
Therefore theſe were denied entrance into the
Houſe. <hi>Eſpernon</hi> attempts by his Followers to
break open the door; which turned to be unlucky.
For the common People, whether of their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
or by the inſtigation of any other, broke
out into a ſudden rage, and gave an Alarm over all
the ſtreets.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eſpernon</hi> thought it his ſafer courſe to go away,
than ſtand the dangers that were imminent. He
quits the Town, and gets him to his Seat of <hi>Pui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paul,</hi>
and afterwards went to <hi>Cadillac;</hi> at laſt to
<hi>Agennois,</hi> where he lingered, unhandſomly caſting
about to work his revenge. I can ſcarcely reach
in words with what ſcorns he was vilified, with
what reproaches affronted, when he left <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finding all the effects of a popular indignation,
in the moſt outragious wreaking of their inveterate
ſpleen. Some ſecretly pitied him, but their kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
would do no good. Then ſurely appeared
evidently the truth of that Maxime; <hi>That Honour
void of merit vaniſhes in a moment. Cominges</hi> aſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to make up all breaches, loſt his labour. <hi>Argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
politickly got leave to be diſmiſſed, not having
found any fit opportunity of doing the ſervice he
deſired. The Faction is now no more at variance
with it ſelf in diverſity of Judgments. The Corps
of the Parliament and City are united together, and
make it their whole buſineſs to contrive way<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:101520:95"/>
               <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> who reſiding at <hi>Agennois,</hi> with making
Entertainments, purchaſed a reputation among his

Now he would make ſumptuous Feaſts; anon
by ſaving of a little money; but all the while pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal
of his fame.</p>
            <p>Word being brought to Court of this ſo notable
a change of Affairs, it is reſolved by any means to
aſſwage the new Tumult; and to releaſe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> that were kept in cuſtody at
<hi>Senbis,</hi> ſending them home to promiſe in the Kings
behalf all juſt condeſcenſions to the Parliament and
Burgers of their Town, provided they would but
heartily return to their duty.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Guinet,</hi> weary of his Office (he
was Captain General of the Forces of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi>)
had reſigned up his Commiſſion in favour of <hi>Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beuf.</hi>
Firſt he had made offer of it to <hi>Bouillon,</hi> who
preſently communicated it to <hi>Conde. Saubeuf</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gracious with the people, watched for the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of ſome Stirs, that he might come into
Honour. Hs was no mean perſon, who had taken
the party of <hi>Orleans</hi> with <hi>Montmorency;</hi> afterwards
was Lieutenant General to the Duke of <hi>Parma.</hi>
Under the Conduct therefore of this <hi>Saubeuf</hi>
are new preparations for War made, both by Sea
and Land. Several ſorts of Veſſels are made, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the <hi>Bourdelois</hi> might be rendred Maſters of the
<hi>Garonne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The News of this at Court increaſed the perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xities
of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who foreſaw the only remedy
of theſe diſtractions to be in the Revocation of
<hi>Eſpernon:</hi> and he could not be revoked without
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:101520:96"/>
the ſubſtituting <hi>Conde</hi> in his place; of whom the
whole Faction was fond, as a perſon ſuitable to the
preſent ſtate of Affairs. Therefore <hi>Mazarine,</hi> as
hath been already ſaid, could by no means <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
brought to it: reaſonably fearing worſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
from their exceſſive affection to <hi>Conde,</hi> than
their hatred of <hi>Eſpernon.</hi> Some thoughts were of
ſending <hi>Orleans</hi> thither, who carried ſo much dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
as might ſerve to appeaſe the diſorders. The
Propoſal did not pleaſe <hi>Orleans,</hi> whether it were
that he doubted of the iſſue, or out of an inbred af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to his eaſe. Nay it was debated, whether
the Kings Majeſty ſhould go thither in Perſon: but
the State of <hi>Paris</hi> required his Royal preſence. At
length <hi>Praſlin du Pleſſis</hi> received this difficult Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
            <p>He did not go ſtraight to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> leſt he
ſhould diſtaſt <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> nor to <hi>Cadillac,</hi> leſt he
might offend the <hi>Bourdelois:</hi> but made a ſtop at
<hi>Lormont:</hi> where in Conference with the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
both from the City and the Parliament, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to reſtore the City and <hi>Guyenne</hi> to its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
quiet. Then was the Fort at <hi>Trompet</hi> cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beleaguered, from the Siege of which he could by
no Arguments prevail to withdraw the <hi>Bourdelois:</hi>
nay, the more he inſiſted upon that unſeaſonable
Article, the more eager was the Siege preſſed, till at
length it had that ſucceſs, as we ſhall afterwards
mention. The iſſue of the Treaty, was <hi>Eſpernon</hi>
muſt be removed; or the incenſed City would
ſtand it out to the laſt. And when <hi>Praſlin</hi> ſpoke of
Moderation, he was hiſſed by the moſt, and called
in deriſion <hi>Argenſon,</hi> as though he trod in his ſteps.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:101520:96"/>
               <hi>Lavieu</hi> returns again to the Court, to relate his
own and his Countries Adventures: <hi>That neither
the Parliament nor</hi> Bourdeaux <hi>did deny to diſcharge
their duty; that the Townſmen were all ready to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
their Loyalty, ſo they might not be in ſubjection
to</hi> Eſpernon, <hi>whom they called the Stone of ſtumbling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lavieu</hi> promiſed his faithful Service, in reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them at the Council board; when he was got
to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> his performances were not agreeable
to his promiſes. Certain it is, he always ſuggeſted
turbulent inſinuations, and oppoſed any accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
ſecretly practiſing <hi>Conde</hi> above others to
ſtand by <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> in this Juncture of Affairs; to
undertake the Patronage of the diſtreſſed City,
which choſe him as the Protector and Recoverer of
its Liberty. He bids <hi>Lavien</hi> be of good courage, he
would ſtand or fall with them. Which afterwards
<hi>Lavieu</hi> when he came home, reported with more
ample circumſtances to put his Townſmen in hope,
and encourage the Faction with vain promiſes,
wherein he was always a main Inſtrument.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Candale</hi> did by a certain Confident move
<hi>Conde,</hi> that he would not abet the diſorderly Riots
to create a feud between himſelf and the Houſe of
<hi>Eſpernon;</hi> they report that the Prince ſhould make
anſwer, <hi>He would do all that lay in his power to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the</hi> Eſpernons, <hi>ſo he might be ſecured of their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and faithfulneſs to him, which wayſoever mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ſhould turn. Candale</hi> rightly interpreting that
ſpeech to tend towards the diminution of his Faith,
that was due to his Soveraign only, neglected to
purchaſe <hi>Conde</hi> at ſuch a rate. Theſe paſſages co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to light, and reported at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> might
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:101520:97"/>
have been ſufficient to have removed any hopes on
<hi>Conde,</hi> had not an unbridled rage blinded the poor
Burgers: who, though they had often received
warning, that nothing was to be expected from
<hi>Cande,</hi> yet would always place their confidence of
being protected on him. So eaſie and obvious a
thing is it under any Mask to bewitch the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
All this time the Caſtle of <hi>Trompette</hi> being
diſtreſſed with the want of all neceſſaries, could no
longer hold out upon hopes of relief: from whence
it came, that thoſe of the Garriſon being pinched
with hunger, drove certain beaſts that grazed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
into their Works. Which proved not their
ſuccour, but their ruine; for presently the Caſtle
was ſtraightly begirt, and battered with Artillery
of all ſort. Thoſe of the Garriſon diſcharge their
Guns. Open Hoſtility is acted on every ſide. <hi>Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beuf</hi>
with <hi>Luſignan</hi> quarter Souldiers in the adjacent
parts, from whence the Garriſon being in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
might have been ſuccoured, and fill the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
too with Guards. They ſeize upon <hi>Podenſac,</hi>
and S. <hi>Georges</hi> Iſle. They rifle the Houſes and
Farms of ſuch as out of moderation would not joyn
with the Faction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eſpernon</hi> with as great ſtrength as he could make,
ſtanding on the other ſide of the River, appeared to
give the beſieged ſome flattering hopes of relief:
for thinking it not ſafe to march forward, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated.
Hereupon the beſieged, reduced to ſome
80 tattered and torn men, were put into extreme
deſperation; having their Turrets battered, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
conſumed, and water corrupted. After two
months defence, <hi>Haulmont</hi> the Governor ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:101520:97"/>
the Caſtle to <hi>Saubeuf,</hi> upon condition of bare
quarter for himſelf and the remnant of Souldiers
that ſurvived with him; rendring the reſt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.
Preſently the common People, like wild
beaſts, flye upon the rubbiſh and ruines of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
Caſtle. The rich Furniture of <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
there for ſecurity, being put to ſale by order, is
made away at inconſiderable prizes. The Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
are drawn away to the Parliament Houſe
door; not only with the applauſe of the people,
but alſo the principal Citizens, provoking every
one to ſhare in the Publick rejoycing. Men were
invited all about the ſtreets to make merry. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
Fajard,</hi> an eminent Counſellor, ſate aſtride up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one of the great Guns, having on his head a
Garland of Ivy and Vine-leaves, reſembling a <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
bearing ſuch branches, in manner not at all
becoming the gravity of his Gown; and drinking
himſelf, ſerved all comers with wine. The <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delois</hi>
with ſtrong ſallies lay the Country waſte far
and near. There were four thouſand Foot (moſt
of them that had left the Kings Colours) and eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
hundred Horſe in the Rebels pay. Having
taken <hi>Pondenſac,</hi> they threaten to ruine <hi>Cadillac;</hi>
but in vain, for there was the flower of <hi>Eſpernons</hi>
Forces. They batter <hi>Langon,</hi> aſſail S. <hi>Macaire.</hi>
The neighbouring Towns fall under the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
Then doth <hi>Doignon,</hi> the Governor of
<hi>Brouage,</hi> enter the <hi>Garonne</hi> with eight Men of War,
moſt of them Fire-ſhips, and not a few leſſer Veſſels
filled with old Souldiers; and lands at <hi>Roche Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont.
Saubeuf</hi> with <hi>Girart</hi> attaque him ſo vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly,
that the Kings Souldiers were forced to get
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:101520:98"/>
again a Ship-board, hardly ſaving their Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
After this were Skirmiſhes with various
ſucceſs. The <hi>Bourdelois</hi> were forced to retire,
by reaſon of ſtrong ſuccours ſent in from all parts
to the Kings Army, the only effectual perſwaſive
to induce the Faction to more ſober courſes.</p>
            <p>Therefore they come to a ſerious Treaty of
Peace. <hi>Alvimar</hi> had brought Articles, which
<hi>Praſlin</hi> ſweetned; as he was wont in Peace and
War to adviſe to a prudent moderation. The
Treaty proceeding, of a ſudden the high ſwellings
and great Conflicts were compoſed upon theſe
terms, <hi>That the Caſtle of</hi> Trompet <hi>ſhould abide in
the ſtate wherein it was at preſent, that is, demoliſhed,
till the Kings coming to be of Age: That the publick
Taxes ſhould be abated; eſpecially that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
Crowns Impoſt upon every Tun of Wine carried out of
the City, ſhould be aboliſhed: that the Conſuls of
every Borough-Town have free liberty of Appeal to the
Parliament of</hi> Bourdeaux. All theſe Conceſſions
were of no great weight; but had they been deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
perhaps poor <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> muſt have been ruined:
the Court-prudence granted the Requeſts.</p>
            <p>Nor yet was their factiouſneſs ſatisfied, who
made their own advantages of the publick Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
or deſigned ſo to do. One of which ſort was
<hi>Mottadelais,</hi> diſpatched to <hi>Madrid,</hi> to ſue for aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
againſt the Royal Forces, and the Tyarnny of
<hi>Eſpernon.</hi> There were divers opinions in the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
Council: of which this was the prevailing, That
<hi>Vattevil Governor of the Province:</hi> Guipuſcoa, <hi>ſhould
in perſon go to</hi> Bourdeaux, <hi>to view all matters, and
after inquiry, report upon what bottom the</hi> Spaniſh
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:101520:98"/>
               <hi>Providence might ſafely build. Vattevil</hi> embarques
at S. <hi>Sebaſtians,</hi> and after a proſperous Voyage, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives
at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> a very few days after the Peace
was proclaimed. He walking abroad, openly guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Train, would aſſiſt at the Publick
Councils, <hi>Praſline</hi> much proteſting to the contrary,
but in vain, for all Ages, Sexes, Ranks were <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaniolized.</hi>
Nor ſeemed this a Ceſſation of Arms, but
a paſſing forward to more deſperate Councils.
There was no end of reviling <hi>Eſpernon.</hi> Thoſe
that had been baniſhed for their moderation, were
not re-admitted. <hi>Villemont</hi> that came thither by
the Kings Order, is aſſaulted. His Coach torn:
and had he not ſtepped into the Fort at <hi>Libourne,</hi> in
his return from <hi>Agennois,</hi> that prudent man had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed.
The Kings money is ſeized; and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benters
contracted for carrying on the ſeditious
War, are paid off. Thus was aſhes raked over the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>embers, which muſt ſhortly break forth again into
flames. Thus much may more than ſuffice to have
ſpoken of <hi>Bourdeaux:</hi> where was a reſpit indeed
from Hoſtility and Arms; but an unfound Peace,
and a grudging indignation breaking out of minds
full ſwollen, which ſeemed to be hatching ſome far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unexpected miſchief.</p>
            <p>During this time the Abbot <hi>de la Riviere</hi> mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Purple Gown, as if that had been the only
concern of the State, put the Court in trouble. Now
what was more difficult than to compaſs that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the good will of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who though he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to do him all good offices imaginable, yet
by certain counterworking ſprings in the mind of
the Pope, undid again all that he ſeemed to be ſo
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:101520:99"/>
earneſtly a doing. The Abbot of <hi>Riviere,</hi> either
never ſounded thoſe depths, or made as if he had
not. He allowed of Congratulations, as though
he had been Cock-ſure of the Promotion; which
no body thought of but himſelf, nor the Taylor
born, who ſhould cut out his Cardinals Gown; yet
was he admitted among the Miniſters of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave,
a conſolation of the Robe long in coming:
and to the end that <hi>Orleans</hi> might be brought
home again to Court, from his Seat at <hi>Limors,</hi>
whither <hi>Riviere</hi> had carried the Duke, making an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
a colour for his luſt: who threatned worſe
matters, as to retire to <hi>Oxitan,</hi> unleſs the promiſes
were made good to <hi>Riviere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conti</hi> at the ſame moment openly teſtified, that
he was reſolved to take Orders, and ask a Cap of
the Pope: begged of the Queen, that ſhe would
pleaſe to intercede for him; whether out of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to cut the Queen out work; or whether theſe
were the Artifices of his Siſter <hi>Longueville,</hi> and
<hi>Rochefoucault</hi> to oblige <hi>Riviere</hi> to them, if he ſhould
ſtand by. All theſe Incidents greatly perplexed
the Court. And the induſtry of <hi>Mazarine</hi> moſt
eminently appeared, in that he ſo neatly could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
ſuch growing intanglements.</p>
            <p>The cauſe of all theſe diſſafections was <hi>Conde,</hi>
who at every turn fell foul upon <hi>Mazarine.</hi> Though
he had given conſent to the Match of <hi>Merc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>r,</hi>
would again croſs it: would draw off <hi>Vendoſme</hi>
with fair promiſes to his party; he would ſee that
he ſhould get the Admiralſhip without ſtooping to
ſuch an unequal affinity, that was wholly unworthy
a Prince of the Blood: would tamper to win <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile</hi>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:101520:99"/>
too over to his Party, who courted the other
Niece of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> ſo that he might put him off
from the Match: he would encourage the <hi>Bourde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois</hi>
not to recede at all from the rejection of <hi>Eſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non:</hi>
the Marriage of <hi>Candale</hi> could not be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
unleſs <hi>Eſpernon</hi> were maintained in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Guyenne,</hi> and the <hi>Bourdelois</hi> ranged
under obedience; whom <hi>Conde</hi> did openly favour
in the Privy Council. Then on the other ſide, he
contended that the <hi>Provenzals</hi> were to be ſeverely
chaſtiſed, and the Count <hi>d'Ales</hi> his Couſin German
not to be deſerted in a juſt cauſe. And when as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could ſo effectually put <hi>Vendoſme</hi> off from that
Alliance, as the denial of the Admiralſhip: <hi>Conde</hi>
ſets his Father in Law <hi>Breze</hi> to ſet his own pretence
on foot to ſue for the Admiralſhip for himſelf; as
though he had not been more than ſatisfied to
comfort himſelf in the loſs of his Child with that
piece of money which had been on that account
beſtowed on him. He induces him too now draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards death, to ſell the Government of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou</hi>
to <hi>Chahot Rohan,</hi> a Dependent of his, that ſo at
the deceaſe of his Father in Law, he might diſpoſe
of that Province at his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Whenas <hi>Conde</hi> was by many arguments diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to aſpire, it ſeemed a wonder to ſuch as dived in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſecrets of the Court, that he did not earneſtly
eſpouſe the <hi>Slingers</hi> Intereſts. Eſpecially ſince
that after his coming from <hi>Compeigne</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> the
minds of all were ſtrangely affected to him. In
truth, then, if ever, he had fortune at his diſpoſal,
ſo that he might have reached with his hand the
top of Authority; and there ſeemed to have been
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:101520:100"/>
nothing wanting to the obtaining the ſupreme
Power, but the taking in the <hi>Slingers</hi> party; by
the awe of whom he might have commanded the
Parliament and City, being the only man then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnified
in the Armies and Provinces. The Prince
let go this opportunity; either queſtioning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
of the <hi>Slingers,</hi> or through the gallantry of
his Spirit, diſliked craft, nor thought it neceſſary to
take ſuch a compaſs; being a deſpiſer of falſhood,
as of all dangers. His Heroical Spirit, ſlighting
<hi>Mazarine,</hi> as well as <hi>Corinth,</hi> expected all good
ſucceſſes from the Event of Affairs, which he
thought could not turn but to his advantage. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi>
who took himſelf to be capable of any For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and plainly was Head of a Party, courted <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine</hi>
ſecretly, and <hi>Conde</hi> openly, with a deſign of
cruſhing one by the other, that ſo himſelf might at
length arrive at the heighth of preferment. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine,</hi>
that more ſubtilly than any man living,
pierced into thoſe Cabinet-counſels, would cleanly
elude thoſe <hi>Corinthian</hi> Arts, yet ſo as he ſeemed not
to underſtand them. <hi>Corinth</hi> perceived the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of <hi>Mazarine:</hi> therefore he was ſeriouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to joyn with <hi>Conde,</hi> by his means to pull
down <hi>Mazarine,</hi> that ſo he might the eaſier pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the ruining <hi>Conde</hi> himſelf. And herein
<hi>Conde</hi> is not to be blamed, who, whatever himſelf
was, ſtill had a jealouſie of <hi>Corinth,</hi> though he made
large proffers. Whilſt this <hi>Triumvirate</hi> plot the
deſtruction of one another, yet the face of the Court
ſeemed calm, when of ſudden this feigned ſerenity
over-caſts, and breaks out into a ſtorm.</p>
            <p>It was a ſmall occaſion. There is four miles off
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:101520:100"/>
               <hi>Rouen</hi> a kind of a ſlight Sconce, which goes over
the <hi>Seyne</hi> with an arched Bridge, and is thence cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Pont arche:</hi> proper for the exacting a paultry
Tell upon Bolts and Barges that go down, or are
rowed and towed up the River with Horſes. When
the Pacification was concluded at S. <hi>Germans,
Longueville</hi> pretended this Fort was promiſed him,
and that by <hi>Conde,</hi> who had requeſted it of <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi>
in favour of his Brother in Law <hi>Longueville.</hi>
[The Cardinal had this wont, that when he was
loth to deny importunate Petitions, he would give
his aſſent, either by a nod, or for the moſt part in
ſuſpenſe terms; which afterwards, when he ſaw
his opportunity, he would more plainly deliver. In
the mean time purchaſing thus much as to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged
from the preſent preſſure. Whenever he
promiſed down-right, without any circumlocuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he never was worſe than his word, if ever plain.
But in ſuch a confuſed ſtate, every one interpreted
the leaſt look of <hi>Mazarine</hi> for a promiſe. From
which miſunderſtanding divers ſorts of inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emces
aroſe: till having got the quiet poſſeſſion of
the Government, he taught the <hi>French</hi> afterwards
better to underſtand his meaning.] Therefore
<hi>Conde</hi> requires that <hi>Pontarche,</hi> as promiſed to him:
<hi>Mazarine</hi> asks day. <hi>Longueville</hi> preſſes <hi>Conde,
Conde Mazarine.</hi> This was a fair opportunity to
him that deſired to break. The buſineſs was not
of any moment to <hi>Longueville,</hi> but he ſought to get
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t, only to hav it ſaid in <hi>Normandy,</hi> that there never
was any ſtir in <hi>France,</hi> but that he got ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>he Cardinal, unleſs it were to gratifie ſome poor

Suitor with it. <hi>Conde</hi> avows himſelf an Enemy to
<hi>Mazarine;</hi> and that he will never come to wait
upon his Majeſty, nor enter into the Court as long
as that Stranger was over the <hi>French</hi> State. The
confluence of all the Nobles is at <hi>Condes</hi> Houſe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the humor of the <hi>French,</hi> that always hunt after
novelties. At the apartment of <hi>Mazarine</hi> in the
Kings Palace, no body appearing near it. None
made any queſtion, but that the breach was incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
The <hi>Slingers</hi> rejoyced; yet did not offer
to aſſociate with the Prince the firſt day, who took
it ſomewhat unkindly, that they ſtood upon the
Ceremony of being asked. Therefore he draws

piece of buſineſs; there being nothing that could
fall out more to the advantage of <hi>Beaufort</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi>
than this breach; who judged that by joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Intereſts with <hi>Conde,</hi> they could eaſily
heave <hi>Mazarine.</hi> The Prince joyfully gave ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to the Heads of the <hi>Slingers;</hi> promiſing to

with advantage. They engage to one another <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

mutual promiſes: all which was preſently carried
to <hi>Mazarine</hi> by <hi>Chabot,</hi> a perpetual Spye of all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets.
This is certain, that <hi>Beaufort</hi> and <hi>Corinth</hi>
did upon this account oblige themſelves to the
Prince, that <hi>Mazarine</hi> ſhould be baniſhed, and not
abide in his Miniſtry, though rendred lame and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled.
<hi>Condes</hi> mind was not ſo, but he would
have the Cardinal broken and maimed, not taken
off, nor baniſhed. Therefore having ſounded the
intention of the <hi>Slingers,</hi> he thought it more advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeable
to oblige <hi>Mazarine</hi> to himſelf than them.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:101520:101"/>
Thus growing more moderate in his paſſion, and
placable, he yielded to be wrought upon by <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>
within few days; whoſe breaſt then firſt of all
did entertain a firm and unmoveable reſolution of
throwing <hi>Conde</hi> into Priſon, from whom there was
no better to be expected, than an imperious courſe
of life, whereby he would hold the prime Miniſter
under his devotion (not as his Servant, but as a

which being highly derogatory to the King and
Queen, the Cardinal could not digeſt. To put this
in execution, ſecrecy and ſubtility were needful:
principally muſt <hi>Orleans</hi> be made a Party; and the
<hi>Slingers</hi> brought in by any means. But before we
relate the whole train of this action, ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
remain to be recited. In the firſt place <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>
makes his peace with <hi>Conde,</hi> deſcending to the
moſt humble ſatisfactions. <hi>Pontarche</hi> is promiſed
<hi>Longueville</hi> within two months; for which <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
paſſeth his word. Other Conceſſions too were
made, which are not proper to mention here. <hi>Conde</hi>
puffed up with this proſperous ſucceſs, judges the
ſame courſe is to be taken for the future of extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
what could be deſired from <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who
muſt fear, or elſe would be feared. It is commonly
given out by the Flatterers of <hi>Conde,</hi> that the Prince
had found out the true way of handling the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
by dealing roughly with him.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> the grand Nephew by the

a place for conſummating the work. None

<hi>That none of the Nobles may marry, without firſt by

he was, that could advance or depreſs at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;

               <hi>Corinth,</hi> the Head of the <hi>Slingers,</hi> in nothing
ſluggiſh, but always intent upon every occaſion,
having got a lucky and fit accident, dextrouſly che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes the matter of new troubles ſpringing forth
upon occaſion of the Rents yearly payable to the
Creditors of the City, that is, ſuch as let out their
monies in the Chamber of the City at a certain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
and the Principal ſecured, as having <hi>Part</hi>
mortgaged for it. The perſons intereſſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining

was choſen of ſix eminent Citizens, who

broke out into ill language; and particularly <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
who was ordered to be arreſted by the Purſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
which attempted in vain to do it. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
aroſe divers murmurings. But nothing ſeemed
a fitter opportunity to the Mutineers for riſing, than
if any one of the <hi>Bouttefeux</hi> were ſlain, or at leaſt
wounded. Therefore as <hi>Joli</hi> was riding in his
Coach <hi>Chartons</hi> houſe, he is ſhot without draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any blood; a Piſtol is diſcharged by a ſuborned
Fellow, who having pierced the Coach-leather
with a harmleſs Bullet, immediately gallopping
away, vaniſhed out of ſight. <hi>Joli</hi> crys out, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been much againſt his will ſtruck at, but
through his own falſhood: <hi>That good Patriots
were murdered: that this was the effect of</hi> Mole'
<hi>s menaces. Charton</hi> highly reſented the attempt, as
making it his own caſe: though both were ſecure
enough, both from the danger of expecting or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
received any harm. All this was but mumme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to make the City take up Arms. The Heads of
the <hi>Slingers</hi> were, glad, and made their advantage
of <hi>Joli</hi>'s wound, murmuring, <hi>that honeſt men ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up ſtoutly for their Countrys good, ſhould have
ſuch violence offered them. What ſecurity was there
in the City? it was no longer</hi> Paris, <hi>but a Den of
Thieves.</hi> They conſult who is the fitteſt perſon to
ſet the City in an uproar. The moſt likely man to
do the feat is pitched upon, one <hi>Eſchalart Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laye,</hi>
a very popular perſon, and one that was in
great reputation, for having conveyed proviſions
into the City, in the time of the Siege. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:101520:104"/>
incites them with language, geſture, affection
to take up Arms; adviſes to ſhut up their Shops
draw the Chains croſs the Streets, and all other
like actions of a Town running frantick. Whether
it were that <hi>Boulaye</hi> out-run the popular fury; or
that the Citizens were not in that fit troubled with
the overflowing of the gall, all was huſht and quiet.
[That beaſt is not always in the humor; nor can
the common People at every moment fall into its
frenzy fits. This Criſis ſoon paſſes over, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to none but old Crafts-maſters in the trade of
Rebellion, to nick thoſe Articles of time.] Yet
their ſtomachs ſwelled, and one might have ſeen
flocks of diſſatisfied perſons at an evening in the
Lanes and Streets, whiſpering one with another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conde,</hi> after his reconciliation to <hi>Mazarine,</hi> ſo
far kept his word to the Queen, as to exerciſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
Hoſtility both againſt the <hi>Slingers</hi> and all
other Mutineers, making it his principal buſineſs to
caſt down whatſoever ſtood up in oppoſition to the
Court: yet in ſuch a manner, as that he might
ſeem the prime Actor, not a Miniſter to execute
what he was ordered. So at once he both highly
diſtaſted the <hi>Slingers,</hi> and in maintaining the Royal
Authority, eclipſed it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Slingers,</hi> before they rendred themſelves,
and intereſts to <hi>Mazarine,</hi> for the pulling down of
<hi>Conde,</hi> ſtrive rather to win the Prince over to their
Party, to make him inſtrumental for the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing
of <hi>Mazarine.</hi> But the Prince receiving
them coldly, and deſiring to be rid of them, as moſt
unwelcome Gueſts: then the <hi>Slingers,</hi> having
abandoned all hopes of prevailing upon <hi>Conde,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:101520:104"/>
to ſurrender themſelves to <hi>Mazarine</hi> upon the
honourableſt terms they can get. What thoſe were
having heard them diverſly related, I can therefore
write no certainty. Some ſay <hi>Corinth was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
a Cardinals Cap:</hi> Beaufort <hi>the Admiralſhip af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Fathers death, paſſing by</hi> Mercoeur: <hi>and a

conſidered in proportion to his being ſerviceable. The
Duke of</hi> Orleans <hi>his Daughter to be married to the
King,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Whilſt this Intrigue is managed with great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy,
and <hi>Conde</hi> acts more fiercely againſt the heads
of the <hi>Slingers,</hi> there fell out, or was contrived a
new Stratagem, the moſt proper one as could have
been invented to exaſperate the Prince, and incenſe
him againſt the <hi>Slingers:</hi> which was the only aim
<hi>Mazarine.</hi> For whilſt the two Factions were
implacably divided, without controverſie, his cauſe
proſpered. Therefore is oyl by a notable device
poured upon the fire already kindled. <hi>Conde</hi> being
in the <hi>Louvre,</hi> is adviſed to look to himſelf, that
there were a knot of men with Arms upon <hi>Pont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeuſ</hi>
in the way to <hi>Condes Palais:</hi> that he was wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for there with ſome miſchievous intention;
therefore that he ſhould decline that Road; but
yet to try the concluſion, that his Coach might be
let go that way. It was done accordingly: Some
Rogues ſetting him there, aſſault the Coach; and
kill his Lacquay that happened to ride in it. The
Prince that lay behither the Bridge, at a Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers,
receiving advice of the attempt made upon
his Coach, falls, into choler. He crys out for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
and due execution of the neglected Laws.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:101520:105"/>
               <hi>Mole</hi> Preſident of the Parliament, who always took
<hi>Condes</hi> part, ſtoutly maintains his quarrel. <hi>Orleans</hi>
that was now diſſaffected to <hi>Conde,</hi> comes yet to the
Parliament, and performs him all exterior offices of
a ſpecious kindneſs. At every turn importunes the
Judges in his favour. The Queen and <hi>Mazarine</hi>
openly deteſt the Fact. Some were of the opinion
that <hi>Mazarine</hi> did not work this deſign; but <hi>Conde</hi>
himſelf with intention of overthrowing the <hi>Slin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi>
whom he might this way moſt eaſily ruine.
Others repute it to have been a meer accident. Now
if there had been a perfect underſtanding between
all other parties, he might then indeed moſt readily
have deſtroyed them that way: yet certain it is,
that Witneſſes examined upon Oath, did depoſe,
that they had heard more than once ſecret whiſpers
and broken words about the killing of <hi>Conde.</hi>
However the matter were, <hi>Mazarine</hi> now ſure of
the breach made irreparable, thinks of ripening the
deſign of his Impriſonment. And ſome little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling
of it was got forth by I know not what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
which the Prince looked upon as groundleſs,
who fancied himſelf <hi>Mazarines</hi> great Favourite,
eſpecially being put into ſtrong confidences by <hi>Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,</hi>
and ſure of <hi>Orleans</hi> by the means of <hi>Riviere,</hi>
which was now quite out of favour, and worn
about him in the falſe reputation of being a man of
buſineſs. <hi>Mazarine</hi> diſliked the ſpreading ſuch a
ſuſpicion, and for the removing of it, preſſes <hi>Conde</hi>
to apprehend <hi>Couture,</hi> expreſſing that many diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
might be racked out of him, by which the
<hi>Slingers</hi> would be quite and clean confounded,
which was the mark he pretended to aim at. The
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:101520:105"/>
Prince thanked him; and undertakes the buſineſs
of providing Troopers and Dragoons, becauſe <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>

Therefore at firſt he admits but very few;
afterwards more, to whom, he imparts the ſecret,
iſſues out Orders for the Execution. Prefixes a

peremptorily he denies it.) But now the Fates
prevailed againſt any Counſels, and had utterly

ſome diſpleaſure againſt him, viſits him, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to over-reach by his ſleights the moſt diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perſon in the world. <hi>Mazarine</hi> made ſhew as
if he believed all that was ſaid, appearing not only
pacified, but friendly: <hi>Spare,</hi> ſaith the Cardinal,
<hi>all this, and let us ſee what courſe is beſt to be taken,
that you may find the Queens grace.</hi> Then he filled
with large promiſes his eaſie credulity, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
embraced ſhadows for ſubſtances. At length
came the deciſive day (it was the 18. of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1650.)
on which I waited after my uſual manner, very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on <hi>Mazarine,</hi> in the behalf of the three Princes,
to deſire ſomewhat of no very great moment; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
comes in <hi>Conde,</hi> who whilſt I make my
addreſs to the Cardinal, and diſpatch my buſineſs,
ſtood whiſpering ſomewhat or other familiarly
into <hi>Lionnes</hi> care; as I was going away, <hi>Conde</hi>
ſpeaks to me to deſire <hi>Longueville</hi> to come thither,
becauſe the apprehending of <hi>Conture,</hi> being under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation,
he might appeaſe the riſing, if any ſhould
be by means of his Couſin and friend <hi>Corinth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I went to <hi>Chaliot,</hi> a little way out of Town
[where <hi>Longueville</hi> lived, to keep at diſtance from
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:101520:107"/>
his Wife.] When I had plainly told him
my obſervation of the approaching danger; he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
me calmly, <hi>That it was poſſible Prince
might be apprehended; but it was to no purpoſe to
warn him that would not, as well as his Siſter, take
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> advice; as for himſelf, having but the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made his peace with the Cardinal, he feared no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
We came to <hi>Paris,</hi> whither he was bound in
all haſte, at the requeſt of <hi>Beveron,</hi> who had deſired
<hi>Longuvilles</hi> interceſſion to <hi>Mazarine</hi> for his Son to
ſucceed in the Government of <hi>Normandy,</hi> To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the evening, <hi>Conde</hi> waits upon the Queen
after his uſual manner: and having heard of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viere,</hi>
unacquainted with the deſign, that the Duke
of <hi>Orelans</hi> would not be there, ſomewhat ſtartled
at it, he ſoon conceived that the defence of his
cauſe in the Parliament was deſerted. He did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly
abſent himſelf, either with intention of
compoſing the ſtorm that was expected, or that he
might not look on the Fact. <hi>Conti</hi> and <hi>Longueville</hi>
meet in the Council-Chamber; where was preſent
the Chancellor, <hi>Servienne, Tellier,</hi> and ſome other
honourable Perſonages of his Majeſties Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.
<hi>Mazarine</hi> was retired into his Chamber, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
carried off the Abbot <hi>Riviere</hi> with him. <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talil,</hi>
Captain of his Majeſties Guards, came earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into the Council-Chamber, and bowing himſelf
to <hi>Condes</hi> ear, charges him in the Queens Name to
go along with him as his Priſoner. <hi>Cominges</hi> doth
the like to <hi>Conti, Creſſy</hi> to <hi>Longueville. Conde</hi> at
firſt ſeemed to laugh at it. Afterwards finding
<hi>Guit ald</hi> to ſpeak in earneſt, he then turned to the
perſons preſent, and ſaid, <hi>The Queen arreſts me by
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:101520:108"/>
this</hi> Guitald; <hi>my dutifulneſs, my loyalty hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

deſerved this; not to mention, my ſervices. I have
not only hopes, but aſſurance in her Majeſies Juſtice.
I deſire you to bear witneſs of my moderation.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he intreats the Chancellor to go to the Queen
in his behalf, and obtain, if it were poſſible, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of her for him. He deſires <hi>Servienne</hi> to do
the ſame with <hi>Mazari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> in his favour. Both of
them obey the Prince. The Chancellor returns,
having in vain attempted to ſpeak with her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty;
<hi>Servienne</hi> came no more back. <hi>Mazarine</hi>
being certified by him, that the work was done,
declares it to <hi>Riviere:</hi> who muttering, as if <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi>
would take it ill, was then plainly told, that
nothing was done but by the approbation of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans.</hi>
He went away, much ſtomaching it; and
when he offered to ſpeak to <hi>Orleans</hi> after his uſual
manner, he had a flat denial: And then was he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
aſſured of his being undone. In the mean
time <hi>Guitald</hi> returns, bringing with him twenty
Souldiers, who ſcouling upon <hi>Conde,</hi> looked as
though they were prepared for ſome bold attempt.
The Prince goes along quietly: but <hi>Conti</hi> could
not digeſt the diſgrace, but fretted, and well-nigh
threatned. <hi>Conde</hi> pacified his Brothers impatience
with advice and his own example. Being carried
down the Privy Stairs without any ſtir, they are
put in a Coach, <hi>Conde, Conti,</hi> and <hi>Longueville;
Cominges,</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Guitald,</hi> never ſtirring
from beſide them; a few of the Kings Horſe being
at firſt in company. <hi>Mioſſain</hi> waited at the <hi>Porti
Richlieu</hi> with a more numerous Troop. Thus are
they conveyed through by-ways, and in the dead of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:101520:108"/>
night to <hi>Vincennes,</hi> without any commotion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing,
although the Coach overturned, and threw
the Priſoners to the ground, rather frighted at their
dangerous fall, than thinking to make any eſcape.</p>
            <p>[I am not ignorant, that it will ſeem like a Fable,
that there ſhould have been ſo much courage in
<hi>Mazarine,</hi> as that in a City greedy after diſſenſions,
where the friends of the Princes were ſo powerful,
he ſhould take the boldneſs, not only to deſign, but
to put in execution a work ſo full of nice hazard:
and that he laid all his project with ſo ſubtle and
ſhrewd forecaſt, as that there was no diſturbance in
the effect. That ſo many Dependents of <hi>Conde,</hi> ſo
many of <hi>Conti,</hi> ſo many of <hi>Longueville,</hi> ſhould all
be wrapped up in ſuch darkneſs, as to ſleep ſluggiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
over their miſeries, not once daring to ſtir, after
having ſo often vapoured of the ſtrength of their
Party.] The <hi>Slingers</hi> run in ſcattering Troops
about the City, as though they had obtained a great
Prize; <hi>Beaufort</hi> with the principal. The ſtreets
were all over light with Bonfires, in token of the
publick Joy: in memory, they would be thought,
of the Siege of <hi>Paris;</hi> whenas <hi>Conde,</hi> unaware of
the Fates, without any preſage of mind, girt in with
a ſtraight Leagure, ſo friendly, ſo favouring a City,
and waſted the neighbour Villages, driving all the
Paſtures, and laying the Country deſolate. The
Queen ſitting up till late that night, waited for the
iſſue of the Action, and reckoned upon every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vement,
as being in a doubtful ſtate betwixt hope and
fear. The ſame did <hi>Orleans.</hi> When the work
was done, the greatneſs of its nature was perceived.
At length comes News of their ſafe arrival at <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cennes,</hi>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:101520:109"/>
where being thruſt into a Tower, all three
Princes in one Chamber, had lain all night ſupper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
on the floor, unleſs <hi>Rantzow</hi> (thrown thither
before by <hi>Condes</hi> means) forgetting the old grudge,
had ſent them in some Bottles of Wine, ſtore of
which he never was without; and ſome Victuals
or other. Walls on the left hand damp, and of a
loathſom ſcent, to make the place of a ſtrength not
to be forced. The Vault is bound with ſtone Arches,
hideous for darkneſs; the room naſty and horrible.
The Princes lying awake, as is uſual in ſuch a caſe,
held divers diſcourſes; <hi>How</hi> Mazarine <hi>had put a
trick upon their credulity: not only that the impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment
was grievous, but the diſgrace joyned with the
reſtraint; ſo many hopes cut ſhort; and the inſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Enemies.</hi> Here <hi>Longueville</hi> put in a
true prophecy. <hi>The Sling,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath thrown as
in hither, and the Sling will fetch us out again.</hi> The
ſame night was <hi>John Perauld</hi> taken, and ſhortly
after caſt into the ſame Dungeon, ſuffered for his
unſpotted faithfulneſs, having this acceſſion of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that having been a true Servant of the Royal
Family, whoſe Intereſt he had always made his
own, ſharing in their fortune, he was involved in
the ſame Fate. My ſelf too, I ſuppoſe, eſcaped becauſe
I was beneath their anger, while they were taken
up in Actions of the higheſt nature. When word
was brought to <hi>Condes</hi> Mother of her Sons diſgrace,
ſhe was overwhelmed with ſuch paſſion of heart, as
ſhe almoſt fell down dead in the hands of the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders-by.
A Lady born of the great <hi>Montmorancy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
carried about her the haughtineſs of their Spirits, &amp;
having been exerciſed with variety of Fortunes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:101520:109"/>
ſhe could not have looked for ſuch a Croſs,
neither could ſhe ſtand up under it. After divers
eſſays to procure her Childrens liberties, at length
broken with affliction, never more coming to the
fight of them, within a few months ended her days
with diſcontent. The Dutcheſs of <hi>Longueville</hi>
tranſported more with grief for her Brothers than
her Husband, hearing of the misfortune, fell on the
ground, and did farther with her lamentations de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file
that night, which had been stained with ſo
cruel an action. The Mother and Daughter were
both perſwaded, that fatal and extreme danger
hung over the Priſoners: and that they would not
have preſumed to go ſo far as this, who had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to proceed to the uttermoſt. The Queen
commands <hi>Condes</hi> Mother to depart the Town:
and confines <hi>Madame Longueville</hi> to the <hi>Palais
Royal.</hi> The former having obtained leave, ſhuts
her ſelf up three days in the <hi>Carmelites</hi> Cloiſter;
from hence ſhe retires to <hi>Chantilly</hi> with her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in Law, and <hi>Enguien, Condes</hi> Son, The latter
is conveyed away by the artifices of the Keeper of
the <hi>Palais,</hi> and with <hi>Rochefoucault</hi> her Guide,
eſcapes into <hi>Normandy</hi> to her Husbands friends to
try their conſtancy. The Mother had reſolved
that black night, to go about <hi>Paris,</hi> to practiſe her
Sons Partiſans, and raiſe the City: but hearing that
all runs croſs; that <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Beaufort</hi> went tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing
about the Town; that Bonfires Were
kindled in teſtimony of the publick Joy; ſhe could
not hold crying. Grievouſly ſhe complained of
the Queen: but the Queens heart being inflexible
and obdurate againſt all prayers, Madam <hi>Condes</hi>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:101520:110"/>
tears were ſhed in vain. A deep Lethargy had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
ſo many Nobles, that had ſo often made fair
promiſes to the Prince. [Never was it evidenced
by ſuch clear proofs, how unſafe are all Court-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidences:
while men are in favour, they are highly
complemented; if once fallen under a Cloud, all
tyes are broken, and they tamely forſaken.] Bouil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon
ſlips away from the preſent danger, and buries
himſelf in the retreat of his Territory of <hi>Thurenne</hi>
His Brother <hi>Thurenne</hi> riding all night through
ſtrange ways, arrives in ſafety at <hi>Stenay: Mouſſay,</hi>
and the other Retainers on the afflicted Family, ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
one one way, and another another: at length
<hi>Stenay</hi> was the <hi>Rendez-vous</hi> of all of them, and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
to others that fell off from the King. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
Longuebville</hi> tryed many means at <hi>Rouen,</hi> but
none offered her their aſſiſtance. The very <hi>Beve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi>
that held the City and old Palace, and were
Lieutenants in that Province, baniſhed her that
Country, and oblige her to go for <hi>Diep,</hi> from
whence, how ſhe came forth, I ſhall afterwards
relate.</p>
            <p>This was the Poſture of the State, upon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning
of the three Princes: none offering to
ſtir, nor ſo much as to bemoan. <hi>That</hi> Conde <hi>ſi
often victorious, that had done ſo many ſignal ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
ſhould be mewed up in a Dungeon! Who would not
admire his Fate, that after ſo many Triumphs, ſhould
fall into ſuch hands? a Perſon, then whom few have
been more worthy of the chief Command ſince</hi> Charles
<hi>the Great, whether you conſider his good ſucceſſes, or
his great courage, or his Spirit equal to any Fortune.
The</hi> French <hi>Nation would have been judged too power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:101520:110"/>
if theſe great endowments had not their allay of
contrary qualities. He had no violence to revenge
wrongs; nor any care to requite courteſies. None was
more obliging in expreſſion, when his need prompted
him: after the danger was over, and his turn ſerved,.
all kindneſſes were utterly forgot.</hi> The Spirit of
<hi>Conti</hi> was ruled by his Siſter <hi>Longueville.</hi> The Duke
of <hi>Longuevilles</hi> humor was full of ſhifts: he would
taſte ſuperficially of all things. There could no
Party riſe, but he would ſide with them. Scarcely
could he get in, but he would draw his foot back,
which would fit a thouſand ſhoes. He might have
ſunk ſeveral times; but he happened by turnings
and windings, to get off clear. He would renounce
his former friendſhips, and apply to new ones, ſo
he had any hopes of advantage by them. Would
court men in proſperity, abandon them in diſtreſs.
Could never deceive any one twice, his cunning
was ſo palpable. Covetous after gain, to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that he might appear to have been a gainer.
He imbaſed the endowments of his mind with vain
Plots. To be ſure he might have kept far enough
from the diſquiet of a Gaol, had not he been a
Turn-coat, and by being true to neither ſide, had
gone about to oblige or to delude both.</p>
            <p>Yet was not the Age ſo wholly barren of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
as not to produce ſome inſtances in that kind
too. <hi>Grammont</hi> went to the Queen, and not deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his paſſion, frankly avowed to her Majeſty, that
he was afflicted for the ſufferings of <hi>Conde:</hi> mixing,
withal ſome other expreſſions, worthy of his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
boldneſs: which he afterwards adviſedly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt,
becauſe of the Oath which he had taken to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:101520:111"/>
the King. That was to him eſſential, always to
act gallantly; having a cheerful, yet weighty bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.
<hi>Mole</hi> alſo favouring the Prince, ſpoke words
of like nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cominges</hi> that remained at <hi>Vincennes,</hi> being called
home, <hi>Bar</hi> is ſet over the guarding of the Priſoners,
who diſcharged his Office, as imperiouſly, as unwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily.
To ſtop the cenſures of Fame, that were very
violent, the Queen ſends a Remonſtrance to the
Parliament to this effect: <hi>that</hi> Conde <hi>did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean
himſelf any longer like a Subject, but a King;
that his increaſing boldneſs was no longer tolerable.</hi>
Conti <hi>grew high upon his Brothers Greatneſs: there
was no end of</hi> Longuevilles <hi>Suits, he muſt have what
he asks, and muſt have it at a day certain; farther,
that no heed was to be given to his word: and that
he was held in priſon, left under colour of</hi> Conde, <hi>he
ſhould make any Stirs in</hi> Normandy. To this the
Parliament agreed. <hi>Mazarine</hi> brings into ſight
his Nieces, that had been locked up in a Nunnery
to pacifie <hi>Conde.</hi> The Wife of <hi>Bouillon</hi> concealed in
an inſecure corner, is taken and ſhut up in the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtille,</hi>
having the liberty of the Garriſon; and kept
there till the Articles concluded with her Husband
at <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> Theſe paſſages were in the City.</p>
            <p>In the Provinces, <hi>Mazarine</hi> watches ſtrictly: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
diſpatched <hi>Vendoſme</hi> into <hi>Burgundy; Harcourt</hi>
into <hi>Normandy; Hoſpital</hi> into <hi>Champaigne;</hi> S. <hi>Ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guan</hi>
to <hi>Bourges,</hi> to ſecure the publick Peace. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſein,</hi>
General over the <hi>French</hi> Forces at <hi>Barcellons,</hi>
being of the Princes Dependants, is taken and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to <hi>Perpignan:</hi> a Perſon experienced in Martial
Affairs, of great reputation, at firſt making ſome
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:101520:111"/>
offer of reſiſtance, bore his hand to his Hilt, upon
ſuſpicion of ſome rudeneſs. Afterwards having
ſtilled the diſorder of his mind, he yielded himſelf
with all obedience to <hi>Joſeph Margarite</hi> and <hi>John
Marcand,</hi> to whom the Kings Orders were ſent.
All care for the promotion of <hi>Riviere</hi> is ſtopped at
<hi>Rome.</hi> So he miſſing the hopes of a Hat, goes out
of the Town, increaſed in wealth, and rich bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices:
having been at firſt in favour with <hi>Orleans,</hi>
for the pleaſantneſs of his humor; he joyns policy
with facetiouſneſs; ſo ſteering the mind of his
Lord, that he never miſcarried through any advice
of his. He never put the Duke upon any difficult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
knowing that he had not abilities to go
through with him. Wiſe men have admired by
what conduct he could ſo long dwell in ſo fickle
and changeable a favour. At length the Womens
inſinuations againſt him defeated all his diligence;
at laſt his affection to <hi>Conde</hi> overthrew him: if
that may be called a ruine, which is a glorious har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of reſt and honour.</p>
            <p>The Queen being certified of <hi>Madame Longue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villes</hi>
intentions (who was reſolved not to ſtir from
<hi>Diepe,</hi> but there to prepare for a ſtout defence, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
hired Souldiers to that purpoſe, with money
by all means raiſed) concludes to go into <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
which lay open for her Entrance, With ſufficient
Forces to reſtrain the attempts of <hi>Madame Longue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville.</hi>
The whole Court comes to <hi>Rouen</hi> through a
Country obnoxious and ſubmiſſive, diſſembling a
friendlineſs, and prone to take whatſoever ſide,
where ſecurity and profit is offered. Every ones
intereſt in that Quarter is the ſad bane of true affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:101520:112"/>
Amongſt ſo many friends of <hi>Longueville,</hi>
purchaſed at ſo dear a rate, and with ſuch artifice,
not one ſtirred. The Parliament of <hi>Rouen</hi> freely
renders to his Majeſties pleaſure. So great is the
peoples policy, that all rejoyced at the fall of
<hi>Longueville,</hi> who had never wronged any one. In
the mean while his Wife endeavours, not with fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
lamentations, but with all her power, by pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
counſel, and language, to put <hi>Montigny</hi> the
Governor and the <hi>Diepois</hi> into a poſture of ſtout de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
The people refuſe; and affrighted by the
Kings approach, who was now drawing nigh in
Perſon, and by the awful Preſence of Majeſty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
upon a Surrender. <hi>Montigny</hi> himſelf talked
of nothing but obedience, as he ſaid, due to the
King. Commiſſioners are ſent to treat on the way,
and offer their Allegiance, declaring that they own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no friend, againſt whom his Majeſties Trumpets
ſhould be blown. <hi>Pleſſe Belliere</hi> is made Governor
of <hi>Diepe, Montigny,</hi> now laying down his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.
The Dutcheſs of <hi>Longueville</hi> thus abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſhifts for her ſelf, and flyes, making her eſcape
ſecretly, riding on a pitiful Jade through by-ways,
without either hope or help. As ſhe rid along by
the Sea-ſide, ſhe lights upon ſome Veſſel accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
on which ſhe embarques with ſome hazard.
Having been likely to be drowned, and hardly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
at length ſhe ventures to Sea: and after the
being toſſed by Fates and Billows, arrives at <hi>Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
in <hi>Holland,</hi> diſtreſſed with the want of all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>cearies;
at a hard ſeaſon of the year, and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous
Sea. Her body brought up tenderly, could
hold out all this. From hence dated comes from
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:101520:112"/>
her a long Epiſtle to the Queen, <hi>That ſhe was
through infinite dangers arrived at</hi> Holland, <hi>having
been obliged to venture her life on the waves for avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the cruelty of</hi> Mazarine, <hi>who ſought her ruine at</hi>
Paris, <hi>and now newly in</hi> Normandy, <hi>breathing out
the deſtruction of the</hi> Condes <hi>Houſe. She beſeeches her
Majeſty to pity her condition and ſinking Family; that
if there be any room for Petition, ſhe would be intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to conceive a good opinion of her, and not ſuffer her
ſelf any longer to be inchanted by the deluſions of the
Cardinal.</hi> In ſuch like terms did this afflicted Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
now come to Harbour, disburden her oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
mind, as is the cuſtom of grief. But, finding
no opportunity of advancing her Cauſe in <hi>Holland,</hi>
ſhe pawned her Jewels, and having raiſed a ſum of
money, went up the <hi>Maze</hi> towards <hi>Stenay.</hi> Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
when ſhe was come, ſhe adviſed about making
a League with the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> Before the King left
<hi>Normandy,</hi> he changed every thing after his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
The awe of him ranged all under obedience.
The Governors of Caſtles, that had been <hi>Longue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villes</hi>
Creatures, were turned out. Caſtles are no
ſuch ſtrong Bars, as the Nobles of <hi>France</hi> take them
to be; They are firm againſt a little commotion,
but flye aſunder at a great Choque. In the Borders
againſt us are not contemptible; but in the Inland
Countries of no uſe. <hi>Harcourt</hi> is made Governor
of the whole Province.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richlieu,</hi> preſently after the Contract of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
had ſhrouded himſelf and his Lady in the

to ſtand by him. The King ſummons him to <hi>Rouen;</hi>
and when he ſought demurs, <hi>Mazarine</hi> not forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

The Caſtles and Cities newly at the

plainly appeared, that our Noble men take a very
ill courſe, when they are ſo importunate to extort
places fortified, which have no ſtrength but with
his Majeſties pleaſure. This practice ſo often
condemned, is always retained. By this means
their Creatures are preſerved from ſtarving; after
that by a miſerable ſervitude, they have purchaſed

and the reſt ſummoned to the Court, do
not come in. And are thereupon declared guilty of
High Treaſon by the uſual way of Proceſs with us.
At the ſame time <hi>Beaufort Corinth, Brouſſel, Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>

            </p>
            <p>So great was the power of the <hi>Slingers,</hi> that they
brought the Queen to comply with all their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts.
The very principal of their Deſigns was, to
make ſtrong applications, that <hi>Seguier</hi> might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
and <hi>Chaſtelneuf,</hi> being weary of his long
confinement, might be reſtored to the keeping of
the Great Seal. He had been Vice-chancellor fifteen

            <p>At the beginning of the Spring, his Majeſty at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by his Nobility marches into <hi>Burgundy,</hi>
where he is received with ſo great applauſe, as was
never to this day known in the memory of man.
[What elſe is practiſed, eſpecially in this part of
<hi>France,</hi> but that Princes, and Grandees ſhould relye
upon their Dependencies, and be deſerted by them
in time of need, as on the contrary for Princes in
their diſtreſs to make large promiſes, and being
once enlarged, to forget nothing ſooner, than obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations

            <p>In <hi>Burgundy</hi> the Parliament, Nobleſſe, Garriſons
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:101520:114"/>
lay down the Colours of the Faction at his Majeſties
feet: and rejoycing at the preſence of their lawful
Soveraign, come to receive his Orders; forgetting
<hi>Condes</hi> Family, as already buried. Only <hi>Tavan</hi> had
put into <hi>Seurrie</hi> with <hi>Colline</hi> and <hi>Sammicault</hi> 500
Foot and 400 Horſe, making ſhew of a ſtout De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
[<hi>Seurrie</hi> is a fortified Town upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Saven</hi> on the Border of <hi>Franche Comté,</hi> now
known by the name of <hi>Bellegarde.</hi>] The Kings
Army, under the Command of <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> cometh
before it. All things are prepared for a regular
Siege. A Line is drawn, which the King out of
youthful Bravery would view, whilſt <hi>Mazarine</hi>
ſhewed it him. The Rebels are enjoyned a Truce
of ſhooting, till his Majeſty having ſurveyed the
Works, was returned again into his Royal Tent.
[In the greateſt Hoſtilities this is a cuſtom with the
<hi>French,</hi> to preſerve that Loyalty to their Liege
Lord.] As ſoon as ever the King was out of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
ſhot, the great Guns were let flye, and ſome
killed by the very ſide of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who continued
to give Orders amidſt thoſe dangerous roarings of
the Canon. The Commanders in the Garriſon
are ſummoned to a Rendition, and agree to it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
within a prefixed number of days Relief ſhould
come, which failing, they ſurrendred the City to
the King.</p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe buſineſſes were acted in <hi>Burgundy,</hi>
the Mother of <hi>Conde</hi> poſtes into <hi>Paris,</hi> and there lay
<hi>incognito</hi> in a private houſe in the <hi>Palace-yard:</hi> till
unexpectedly failing down at the feet of <hi>Orleans</hi>

ſhe would moderate her grief, and not prejudice her
Sons and her own intereſt by unſeaſonable applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
that the remedy of all was to be expected from
time only.</hi> The like did <hi>Beaufort</hi> and <hi>Corinth.</hi> Thoſe
thoſe that are <hi>Curieux</hi> in Court-affairs were from
that day forward aſſured of the future liberty of the
Princes. The Princeſs Dowager of <hi>Conde</hi> preſents
a Petition to the Parliament by <hi>Lande Payen,</hi> who
couragiouſly read it in the Houſe. The ſubſtance
of it was a charging <hi>Mazarine</hi> upon divers Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
and ſtriking at the Queen through his ſide.
She is commanded by Act of Parliament to leave
the Town: but petitioning for the reſpit of three
or two days to put her affairs in order for her laſt
parting, nay at the laſt of one, and having obtained
that, ſhe goeth for <hi>Berne:</hi> from whence alſo being
baniſhed by Order from the King, ſhe lodged at the

that is, a weak aſſiſtance, pompous indeed for

            <p>Theſe things paſt on the Borders of <hi>Champaigne;</hi>
whilſt <hi>Bouillon</hi> and <hi>Rochefoucault</hi> drive on no leſs
deſigns at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> which was another Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarter
of the aſſociated Provinces. And as <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi>
influenced the Counſels of Madam <hi>Longue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
ſo his Brother <hi>Bouillon,</hi> the chief Confident of
the Princeſs of <hi>Conde,</hi> diſpoſed of the Affairs in
<hi>Guyenne</hi> at his pleaſure: the reſt were but proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
He having drawn her and her Son <hi>Enguien</hi>
from <hi>Monterotondo,</hi> conveyed them through <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergne</hi>
(whilſt <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> and the <hi>Chevalier Valet,</hi> in
vain oppoſed their paſſage) upon the diſadvantage
of grounds, either cunningly giving the Go-by, or
ſucceſsfully fighting, till they came too near <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux.</hi>
It was diſputed, whether they ſhould be
admitted into the Town: At length remembring
<hi>Conde,</hi> the principal cauſe of whoſe Impriſonment
was attributed to his taking the part of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi>
they open their Heart and Gates to <hi>Enguien</hi> and his
Mother, letting in none beſides their menial Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.
Within a little while the City was ſet open,
keeping out none, not ſo much as the <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
who rejoycing to dreſs his wounds at the fire kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in <hi>France,</hi> poured in oyl, and laid fuel upon the
flame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mazarine</hi> turning his watchful eyes on every
ſide, daily ſuffered growing inconveniencies at
<hi>Paris;</hi> apprehending more danger to the State
from the Artifices of the <hi>Slingers,</hi> than from the
Confederates, or any foreign force. The Cardinal,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:101520:116"/>
under colour of repelling the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
the King to <hi>CompiegNe,</hi> with deſign of reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him from the jaws or the <hi>Paris</hi> Faction, which
was plotting more dangerous miſchiefs than the
former. <hi>Rochefoucault</hi> began firſt to act in open
Hoſtility. <hi>Saumur,</hi> where is a Bridge over the
<hi>Loire</hi> (a paſs always regarded at the breaking out of
Civil Wars) had been beſtowed upon <hi>Cominges,</hi> as
a reward of his good ſervice in the apprehending
of <hi>Conde. Dulmont</hi> Governor of the Caſtle of <hi>Sonmur,</hi>
loth to reſign, acquaints <hi>Rochefoucault,</hi> that if
he would ſend him in Auxiliary Forces into the
Fort, he would afterwards ſtoutly hold it for <hi>Condes</hi>
Party. <hi>Rochefoucault,</hi> who was now preparing for
his March into <hi>Guyenne,</hi> having gathered out of his
Lands at <hi>Poictiers</hi> and <hi>Engouleſme</hi> a Band of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
under pretence of ſolemnizing his Fathers
Funerals, marches away ſpeedily for <hi>Saumur;</hi> but
the haſte of <hi>Dulmont</hi> in reſigning up the Caſtle, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
all their deſigns. <hi>Rochefoucault</hi> failing of
that hope, turned his thoughts to the buſineſſ of
<hi>Guyenne,</hi> and to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> deſigning to gain to
himſelf S. <hi>Simon,</hi> the Governor of <hi>Blaye.</hi> Who
thinking with himſelf, how much he was indebted
to the late King; upon which obligations he had
promiſed an unſpotted faithfulneſs to his Son; and
withal how full of hazard theſe attempts were,
ſtopped his ears. <hi>Rochefoucault</hi> joyning with
<hi>Bouillon,</hi> having dextrouſly enchanted the Spirits
of the <hi>Bourdelois,</hi> enters the Town, and preſently all
Viſors are caſt off, and <hi>Enguien</hi> is declared Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
in Chief of all the Forces, and <hi>Bouillon</hi>
with <hi>Rochefoucault</hi> his Lieutenants. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:101520:116"/>
ſuccour is openly implored by certain Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and the fire of Civil War raiſed, only <hi>Eſpernon</hi>
and the <hi>Chevalier Valet</hi> being in Arms for the
King. For even <hi>la Force</hi> with his Children, having
long demurred; not upon the matter, but upon
money, at length took to the diſaffected Party.</p>
            <p>Hitherto have I related what paſt on the one and
the other ſide after the impriſoning of the Princes
in their favour. Now to return to the Priſoners.
The firſt eight days paſt over them, as though they
had been buried alive. From that time, every hour
were they informed of all paſſages; either by a
falſe Ink, which was rendred legible, by being held
to the fire: or by Notes put into Crown pieces,
which were by a rare Art made hollow for that
purpoſe, the metal being no ways conſcious: or by
a Prieſt, who whilſt he was ſaying Maſs, inſtead of
the Liturgy, read them a new Goſpel; or whether
it were that <hi>Barre</hi> did ignorantly deliver the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were on the back-ſide, and innocently betray
himſelf, although he were very vigilant, ſo as to
enquire nicely into all the circumſtances; and free
from any corruption, only contenting himſelf with
his Gaolers Fees. The Cardinal and <hi>Slingers</hi> fell
to be greatly at odds, ſo as to betray one another,
and treat with the Priſoners, about Marriages, and
in a manner ſharing the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>About this time ſuch a Plot was diſcovered at
<hi>Vincennes:</hi> the Garriſon conſiſted of 200 Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
forty of which did with one conſent conſpire
againſt <hi>Barre.</hi> As he was at prayer in the Church,
it was reſolved to double-lock the door on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,

ſwallowed, as people are always more ready to
give credit to the worſe ſurmiſes. Nor did the

the Principal men argued after this manner. <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi>
being eaſie of belief, and now incenſed againſt

               <hi>Mazarine</hi> contrived what he afterwards put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,
by the inſtigation of his Wife chiefly, who
rejoyced at the impriſonment of <hi>Conde,</hi> upon the

means come to be Principal in the management of
the State: which when ſhe ſaw proved otherwiſe,
ſhe choſe rather to have <hi>Conde</hi> an Equal, than <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine</hi>
Superior. <hi>Orleans</hi> being deſired to go Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
General in the Expedition into <hi>Guyenne,</hi> not

lain in a naſty Priſon, and reſtored to the

no other aim, but to ſhape a ſafe courſe, ſo as to
diſoblige, neither party. He perſwades <hi>Orleans</hi> to
conceal his mind, and not to be openly violent;
that time produces many things, from thence he
ſhould expect whatever he deſired. In the mean
while he might do well to wait on the Queen, who
would deny him nothing. Her Majeſty adheres
to her reſolutions, and ſo the Journey proceeds.
<hi>Orleans</hi> being left with a full power between the

of Stratagems to vouch their deſigns; the
thoughts of the Common-people working without
end. The honeſt Party at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> mixt with
the factious, did what they could to moderate their
boldneſs, and the violent courſes of thoſe who
thought it no leſs diſhonour to yield, than to be
conquered. <hi>D'Ognion</hi> keeping cloſe in his Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

<hi>Sanſimon</hi> at <hi>Blay</hi> continued loyal, and that was
all: Commiſſioners and Mediators of Peace went
forward and backward, from one to the other
ſide.</p>
            <p>All which the miſchance of <hi>Richo</hi> and <hi>Canoul</hi>
broke off. The former was Governor under the

up at <hi>Libourne</hi> for that purpoſe, though for ſome
hours he had been held in falſe hopes of pardon by

the Common-people of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> broke out againſt
<hi>Canoul.</hi> He having been taken at S. <hi>Georges</hi> Iſle,
which he held for the King, was held Priſoner of
War at large, till the Execution of <hi>Richo</hi> being

hold on in its Rebellion begun, until by publick or
ſecret Articles, they might fiſh out ſomewhat to
make for their private advantages, which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually

            <p>This Pageantry ſometimes ſmilingly flattered

was aſhamed of the egregious Impoſture. How
beneath her Spirit, was this Fortune! The Pattern
of rare Gallantry which ſhe held forth, was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
by the obſtinacy of the Faction. Only the
two Commanders were comforts to her diſgrace,
that is the dignity of the Delinquents. She young
Lady was ſcarce entred upon the Luſtre of the
Court, when of a ſudden ſhe was overthrown by
the great fall of her Husband, from whom ſhe
might have preſumed to have had no other but a
title to unqueſtionable happineſs. In the mean

the State, our Souldiery over all the Quarter of

and without money. The Garriſon-Souldiers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

the neighbouring Territory, and when they had
pillaged all, would tear from them as it were their

An</hi> 1650. with a great Train for War: the Army
conſiſted of 12000. choice men; the Captain was
<hi>Praſlin,</hi> a perſon always ſtout and loyal (yet I know
not whether he ever received rewards ſuitable to his
actions, farned all abroad.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Siege of</hi> Rhetel <hi>is reſolved upon. It is a
City upon the</hi> Auſne, <hi>famous for variety of Fortune,
more than any thing elſe. It hath ſo often changed
one Maſter for another, and one Enemy for another, as
a Ball banded to and fro. Happy in the fruitfulneſs of
the ſoil: There is ſtill the firſt Camp upon falling
out. The rough flints, with which it is paved, prove
it to be naturally warlike. John Delipont, a</hi> Napo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan
<hi>held the Garriſon with 200 Horſe, and 1500
Foot, but the</hi> French <hi>attaquing it, preſently pierce
the Suburb, and batter the Walls falling with age
And neglect. Three days after</hi> Delipont, <hi>not able
to ſuſtain ſo furious an Attaque, ſigned Articles of
Surrender, and marched out before the day accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
In ſo great a fright was he, although there
were hope of</hi> Thurennes <hi>coming: who having ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
towards his relief, upon hearing the Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at</hi> Tugny, <hi>retreated. The Cardinal ſpeedily
came to</hi> Rethel, <hi>that he might in perſon upon the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:101520:130"/>
place encourage and adviſe them.</hi> Praſlin <hi>was by
this time got up to Thurenne</hi> reſolved to try it out
in a pitched Battel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurenne</hi> was vexed to be thus put by his Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-quarters,
and left at uncertainties whether to
betake himſelf, then what fretted him worſe, was
the ſhameful loſs of <hi>Rhetel,</hi> the work having been
carried only by two Regiments; for the groſs of the
<hi>French</hi> Army ſlighting the Siege, in long and late
Marches hunted out the Enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Praſlin</hi> is certified by <hi>Hoquincourt</hi> and <hi>Roſe</hi> the
<hi>German,</hi> that <hi>Thurenne</hi> was not gone far, but drew
himſelf up for fight in the next Valley of <hi>Bourg,</hi>
which he had ſignified to his Souldiers by a three-fold
diſcharge of his Guns. Shortly, that is, about
an hour after, both Armies marched in parallel
Lines; each ſeeking an advantagious ground. <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi>
waited for the <hi>Lorrainers,</hi> by whoſe coming
up, being ſtrengthned, he ſtood off no longer, but
committed the main tryal to the Fortune of a
Battel.</p>
            <p>The day was the 15. of <hi>December, Anno</hi> 1650. in
cloudy Weather. The Village next to the Plain
where the fight was, is commonly called <hi>Somp,</hi> one
might better call it a heap of Cottages. <hi>Thurennes</hi>
Cavalry were about 5, his Infantry about 4000;
the <hi>Lorrainers</hi> were led by <hi>Ligneville</hi> and <hi>Fouge</hi> the
<hi>Savoyard,</hi> the <hi>Wallons</hi> by <hi>San-Maria,</hi> the <hi>Germans</hi>
by <hi>Lanaw.</hi> There were alſo <hi>French</hi> Rebels; The
<hi>Croats</hi> Dragoons led the Forlorn (like the <hi>Roman
Rorarii</hi>) that with their light-ſhot begin the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
as the ſmaller drops are wont to fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it rains down-right. It the <hi>Van</hi> were ſix great
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:101520:130"/>
Guns placed ſo, that it may paſs for a fair pitched
Battel.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Battalia was skilfully drawn up, and
was the very flower of the old Souldiers, among
which were moſt eminent <hi>Villequier</hi> and <hi>Hoquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,
Navaille, Manichamp, Pradeau, Inville,</hi> and
not a few others of long Experience of War; the
whole Body amounted to above 10000; and had
their Pieces of Artillery too, but lighter ones. <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlin</hi>
appearing in the Head of the right wing, gave
out his Orders. <hi>Thurenne,</hi> after his uſual manner,
led his left Wing. The hotteſt of the Engagement
was upon our right ſide, where the Son of <hi>Praſlin,</hi> a
very hopeful young Gentleman, was loſt. <hi>Dur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi>
and <hi>Bouteville</hi> with <hi>Beauvoſſe</hi> and <hi>Montolier,</hi> at the
firſt charge broke through our whole Wing, and
came up to the very Train of Artillery. <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>champ</hi>
firſt routed the <hi>Lorrainners: Villequier</hi> came
up alſo, and gave a great turn to the wavering and
uncertain Victory. <hi>Lanaw,</hi> who commanded five
<hi>German</hi> Regiments, being made Priſoner after his
Horſe was killed under him, gave terrour to his
Party; and here the face of the day, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doubtful, began to alter. At the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were take <hi>Ligneville</hi> and <hi>Fouge,</hi> which gave
the <hi>Lorrainers</hi> under them occaſion to give back.
Then the Victory turned manifeſtly to the <hi>French</hi>
ſide. For <hi>Thurenne</hi> having his Horſe wounded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him, could no longer be preſent to give quick
Orders in the ſudden Emergencies at ſeveral parts;
nay, he was near the being taken Priſoner, and ſo
he had been, unleſs he had been lent a Horſe to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
on, and had got clear by paſſing for a <hi>French</hi>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:101520:131"/>
man. All on both Wings of <hi>Thurenne</hi> were either
taken or ſlain, and only his own Regiment ſtood it
out to the laſt. There were taken Priſoner <hi>Boutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,
Gamarra, Ligneville, S. Quintine,</hi> and <hi>Hocourt,</hi>
and the Kettle-drums and Colours loſt. In the
<hi>French</hi> Army, beſides the Son of <hi>Praſlin, Alvimar,
Corvald, Valey, Brenſe,</hi> and the Brother of <hi>Roſa</hi> were
loſt, and about 500 common Souldiers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurenne</hi> retired by <hi>Barleduc</hi> to <hi>Stenay</hi> to Madam
<hi>Longuevilles,</hi> who made acquainted with the loſs

triumphed, even to envy, which immediately
pouring in, overthrew all <hi>Mazarines</hi> Proceedings,
ſo Prudence is for the moſt part wont to ſink under
Fortune.</p>
            <p>For adorning the Victory, and procuring more
Creatures, the Office of Mareſchal was made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and as it were promiſcuouſly diſpenſed. <hi>Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quier,</hi>
afterwards ſtyled <hi>d'Aumont, Hoquincourt, St<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neterre,</hi>
and to gratifie <hi>Orleans, Ferte Imbauſſe,</hi> were
preferred to that Dignity. <hi>Grancey</hi> being offended
that he was not taken into the crowd of Mareſchals,
withdrew to his Government of <hi>Gravelin,</hi> giving
out high Words, by reaſon of which afterwards at
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:101520:131"/>
the interpoſition of <hi>Orleans,</hi> he compaſſed his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
leſt otherwiſe <hi>Gravelin</hi> might have been in
ſome danger, which was the Top and Crown of the
Triumphs of <hi>Orleans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was grown a faſhion to extort all things by
threats, nor was there, at that time, any readier way
to Riches and Honours. Not ſo much the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Age, had introduced this and the like ill
uſages into <hi>France,</hi> as the unbridled liberty of the
Court, eſpecially taking upon them at that time.
<hi>Mazarine</hi> under conſtraint would promiſe any
thing only for that little moment, till he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
himſelf out of the preſſure of his Exigents,
having a tender forhead to deny any one any thing.
And as water on a ſmooth board or ſtone eaſily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
which way ſoever the fingers draw it: ſo did
he comply with every Petition, which were infinite.
As often as the <hi>French</hi> man feels the weight upon
his back ſit light, he abuſes without meaſure the
gentleneſs of his Rider, taking a licentiouſneſs of
offending from a preſumption of pardon. That
airy people is not to be fixed but by fear: nor was
any man in the world more inwardly acquainted
with the temper of his Country than <hi>Armand Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lien,</hi>
who firſt rid <hi>France</hi> with a curbed Bit, and
brought in terrour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mazarine</hi> encountred more ſad difficulties upon
the Victory, than in the Battel. The Faction at

They blab out nothing any where, or ſpeak with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
premeditation; every where was profound
ſilence, or diſſembling words more dangerous than

gives the moſt unavoidable blow, the counterfeiting
a friendship more pernicious than any malice, only
to gain more credit to malignant ſuggeſtions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
amidſt ſpecious Applauſes; a venom to be
feared, eſpecially from thoſe that our Confidents,
and lodge in our very boſoms.</p>
            <p>The diſcerning Cardinal perceived thoſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
but either the Queens indiſpoſition, or the
malignancy of his Fate brought him back into the
City on the laſt <hi>December,</hi> 1650. where only the
Liſt of his Succeſſes was his overthrow, as theiis at
<hi>Athens,</hi> who were baniſhed by the <hi>Oſtraciſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament which hitherto had kept within

            <p>Every ſuch general Commotion is always fatal,
nor can ever be ſuppreſt or regulated by any Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.
The colour of their diſſaffection was the
enlargement of the Princes, which every Party
wiſhes, but with different pretences. <hi>Corinth</hi> was
then the vital Spirit, which the whole Combination
drew. He only ſtrove not that the Princes might
be ſet at liberty, but removed to <hi>Paris,</hi> and kept in
leſs cloſe confinement, that afterwards when <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi>
was expelled, at pleaſure, either he might him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
releaſe them, or keep them in cloſer reſtraint;
that ſo he might inſinuate himſelf into the <hi>Sling,</hi> the

            <p>
               <hi>Orleans</hi> requeſted the Senate, for the moſt part
by <hi>Corinth</hi> his Deputy, and ratified what he deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his Name, although ſometimes they were bold
words, and ſuch as neither agreed with the gravity
of the Hearers, nor the Character of the Speaker.
Nay, would exaſperate the Aſſembly againſt <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi>

for being, as he ſaid, the Author of all the publick
Troubles; taking always the Engagement of the
Princes for a Cloak. Such Aſſemblies were often
forbidden by the Queen; but always retained and
more frequented. <hi>Orleans</hi> in perſon, not regarding
Wife and Children, nor minding his Dinner, would
abide whole days in the Parliament-Houſe, preſſling
the Baniſhment of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> and the Releaſe of the
Princes without end. Nay, kept at diſtance from
the Queen, which he had not hitherto done, would
make more addreſſes to her, nor could be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
upon by any intreaties, to come to a private
Conference with her, till the Princes were ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:101520:133"/>
and <hi>Mazarine</hi> in good earneſt expelled out
of the <hi>French</hi> Dominions. The Parliament by
humble Petitions and Adviſes inculcated the ſame
into the Queen, but <hi>Mole,</hi> the Premier Preſident of
the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> made this grave and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Speech to her Majeſty. <hi>There might not be
any longer ſhifts, nor alledging dilatory excuſes; the
excellent Priſoners muſt be releaſed, and could no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
be detained in a dark Dungeon, without forfeiture
of the</hi> French <hi>Allegiance, whoſe very appearance now
poſting away, was ready to break, forth into open Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
unleſs the imminent miſchiefs were timely
provided againſt. It was not equitable nor ſeemly
for the Kings Uncle to give way to a Foreigner. One
of them muſt be gone. Now it were better for a
Stranger, the cauſe of all the diviſions, before any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
be offered him, to go away without ſuffering
harm, than for the Duke of</hi> Orleans <hi>to come no more to
Council, and all the State run to confuſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When this was heard there were no more debates
about the Cardinals departure. The Leading-men
of the Royal Party offered their ſervices, as though
<hi>Mazarine</hi> were to be maintained by force of Arms,
and drawing up Souldiers into the City; but he
judged theſe to be but flaſhes. Nor will a wiſe
man ever depend upon ſuch promiſes in adverſity
always vaniſhing into the air.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Cuboville,</hi> which is a Town of <hi>Normandy,</hi>
not far off <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> was a Letter written by
the three Princes, and delivered to the Parliament,
wherein the Illuſtrious Priſoners implored the
Laws trampled under feet, and Statutes unexecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Petitions alſo from the Princeſs of <hi>Conde,</hi> and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:101520:133"/>
the Daughter of <hi>Longueville</hi> were preſented to the
Parliament, which was then Umpire of the <hi>French</hi>
differences. The Princes followers took courage
from the ſucceſs, and held, which is ſtrange, ſecret
Treaties, in a City that keeps no Council, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of which was; <hi>That the Princes by all means
be releaſed; that a Match be procured between</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guien
<hi>the Son of</hi> Conde, <hi>and</hi> Alencon <hi>the ſecond
Daughter</hi> of Orleans; <hi>as alſo between</hi> Conti, <hi>and the
only Daughter of Madam</hi> Chevreuſe, <hi>a Hat for</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth:
and what is the principal Article, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine
be <hi>exterminated.</hi> All this did <hi>Corinth</hi> get
ſubſcribed by <hi>Orleans,</hi> without the knowledge of
<hi>Beaufort,</hi> who would otherwiſe have let forth all
the ſecret into <hi>Monbazons</hi> boſom, which afterwards
having been ſearched into by the ſubtility of the
Cardinal, would utterly have overthrown the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
before their Releaſe, and themſelves while
they were entring upon the Intrigue.</p>
            <p>All theſe Tranſactions were carried every hour
to <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> and the anſwers of the Princes
brought back to <hi>Paris,</hi> as though the Princes were
already at full liberty by correſpondence, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
but unrevealed, the Servants, Doctors, and
Keepers of the Princes, being bribed, whilſt <hi>Bar</hi>
was very careful, but altogether ignorant, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a great ſtir to no purpoſe. Who would not
wonder at ſo great cloſeneſs in a babling Nation:
and that which will make the miracle ſurpaſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
all to be managed by Women, not only Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curers
of pleaſure, but Platonick Lovers, which
proved yet moſt faithful in this buſineſs. A prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
thing! for what ſteadineſs can be imagined
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:101520:134"/>
in ſo ſlippery a Sex, amongſt ſo many Burglars of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens Beds, and complemental Flatterers, which
are the moſt effectual motives to female minds?</p>
            <p>The Queens aim was to delay and ſpin out the
time, till the Kings coming to Age, at which all
proceedings ſhould be either ratified, or diſannul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
<hi>Orleans,</hi> his Dutcheſs, and elder Daughter,
their deſigns were to enlarge the Priſoners, for the
restraining, not taking off <hi>Mazarine:</hi> the ſame
was the ſenſe of the Parliament and <hi>Sling.</hi> Only
<hi>Corinth</hi> was for ruining utterly <hi>Mazarine,</hi> and by
acquiring a Hat, to be Lord of all. <hi>Chaſteaune<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

upon every occaſion, more ſtudious to perform his
duty, than advance any private Intereſt of his own,
and whoſe Priſon was more honourable than his
Succeſſors Empire, could not digeſt the diſhonour
of her Majeſty; therefore having invited all the
Princes friends, he propounded to them equal
terms upon which they might be beholden to the
King only for their Liberties, and not the Faction.
Theſe were admitted, and very well accepted of
out of fear, leſt <hi>Orleans</hi> having expulſed <hi>Mazarine,</hi>
and entred upon the Government, by the counſel
of <hi>Corinth,</hi> ſhould not earneſtly promote the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement
of the Priſoners, counting it perhaps
better in what matters he ought to be prime and
alone, not to take on <hi>Conde</hi> for his Colleague.</p>
            <p>But all this was to no purpoſe, becauſe the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
perhaps by too precipitate an haſte, as ſome
would have it be, prevented all, and went and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased
the Princes of himſelf, as ſhall be more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
related in the following Book.</p>
            <p>Now nothing did more effectually incite <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:101520:134"/>
to depart than the face of the City in an Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar.
That Sea of tumultuous people did ſwell:
and in theſe, as in paſt Seditions, ſuch was the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Commonalty, as to be of great weight in
every occaſion. This therefore muſt be the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
that it be never raiſed ſince, when it is once
raiſed, it can be ruled by no Reins. But a Stranger
will be inquiring, What is that which in this place
is called the Commonalty, which is called the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
It is that multitude which is ſeen in <hi>Paris,</hi> that
the infinite number of houſes there can ſcarce
hold. The greateſt part of that throng lives out
of their Country; they are Natives of other Lands.
Order all theſe to be ſummoned, and ask every one
of them, what is his Country? you will ſee that
they have left their habitations, and are come by
throngs into that City, which denying none, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the common Country of all the World, by a
certain Plaiſter well tempered, becauſe in that Town
are great Rewards propounded to Vertues, and
greater to Vices.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>The CONTENTS. After the Releaſe of the Princes, and the Departure of
Mazarine, there followed not bleſſed Proſperity, as
was expected: Nor were the Troubles of the State
compoſed, but all grew worſe. Conde finds fault
with the Management of the State, and removes
the Miniſters. Extorts the Government of Guyenne,
rejecting his preſent one of Burgundy: ſo chuſing a
fit Scat for his future Inſurrection. He withdraws.
The Civil Commotions break out afreſh; and a
third Bourdeaux War ariſeth. Hereupon Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
is revoked, upon this ground to ſuccour the King
that was again diſtreſſed by the Faction. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
hath Honour procured him by his Enemies,
inſtead of diſgrace.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE Counſels of the honeſt Party being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verborn
by violence, <hi>Mazarine</hi> preferring
what was neceſſary before that which was
plauſible, withdrew himſelf from the preſent Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of Affairs. It was a great Victory to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that they had chaſed him out of <hi>France,</hi> as
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:101520:135"/>
the Perſon, who by the greatneſs of his Genius had
hitherto advanced the Royal Intereſt, and upon
whoſe death or abſence they hoped any thing
might be more eaſily gained from the Queen.
Hereupon throwing off all reverence, men revolted
from their Loyalty, not by degrees, but running
headlong; the State turning to all licentiouſneſs,
ſo that what they thought they might get by force,
they cared not to ſue for.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Feb. 6. An.</hi> 1651. in a night without Moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine,
the Cardinal, <hi>incognito,</hi> diſguiſed in a habit
unſuitable to his Eminency, guarded by about 200
Horſe, riding himſelf a Horſe-back, retired to S.
<hi>Germans, Harcourt</hi> beating the way, who was the
perpetual Executioner of Court-commands; there
he tarried a day. Divers advices and reports that
came from <hi>Paris,</hi> he heard and ſlighted; but pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues
his Journey to <hi>Havre de Grace</hi> through the
midſt of <hi>Normandy,</hi> with a pompous Train gazed
at by all the people, as he paſſed along. The ſame
command over his countenance which he had in
his Grandeur went along with him at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<hi>Nor it there any more certain Symbol of a brave
Spirit than not to ſhrink at the charge or encounter
of any adverſe Fortune.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He took order for diſpatching what was to be
diſpatched, without any oſtentation of buſineſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of conditions ſo tempered, between active and
mild, as that none did more affectionately deſire a
calm, or was more able to weather out a ſtorm.
When the matter required ſitting up late, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
wakeful. But Fortune towards the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
was in ſuch extremes, that he who lately
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:101520:136"/>
thought he wanted Land for Victory, now wants
place for Refuge and Sanctuary. And what may
be accounted incredible, amongſt ſo many as he
had obliged, finds the relief but of few. So it is; <hi>Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nce
thinks that any obligation holds in force to the
Afflicted, or retains the memory of paſt kindneſſes from
one, now, in Adverſity: or when did Faith not depend
upon Fortune?</hi> whoever had reaped any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
by him, turned the <hi>Odium</hi> upon the Giver, and
judged it equitable to keep what he had received of
<hi>Mazarine,</hi> but let <hi>Mazarine</hi> who had beſtowed it,
be baniſhed or deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>Nor yet would <hi>Paris</hi> think it ſelf ſafe, if the
name of the Cardinal in his greatneſs did any where
continue. All apprehended him, as though he
were ſtill ready to come upon all of them: and that
he might be rendred more odious; fear was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited.
Therefore the Parliament made terrible
Ordinances to have him quite exterminated out of
the Kingdom; and branded the memory of him,
as he departed by daily impeachments with perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
marks of Infamy. The Common-people tore
him continually with popular Rage. Thus do
Quarrels riſing upon partial Factions out-laſt the
fears upon which they are grounded: for now
there were no farther apprehenſions of him. The
firſt attempt was; The clapping a ſtrict Guard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the King and Queen, under colour that they
might not by any ſleight get out in a ſecret way to
follow after <hi>Mazarine. Orleans</hi> was now in the
higheſt power, who could not be prevailed upon
by any intreaties of the Queen Regent to be preſent
at Council, ſtiffly denying to yield to it, till the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:101520:136"/>
Princes were firſt enlarged; which for ſome days
he punctually obſerved; whether it were <hi>Corinth</hi>
that fortified the reſolution of <hi>Gaſton,</hi> in other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
ſickle, or <hi>Gaſton</hi> himſelf having ſo often ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for his inconſtancy, had now put on a ſtoutneſs
for a few days. <hi>Chevreuſe</hi> practiſed a thouſand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes
in favour of the Priſoners, as though in Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be thereby Mother in Law, upon the Match
of her Daughter, ſometimes would wooe <hi>Orleans</hi>
her ſelf, ſometimes by <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Chaſteauneuf;</hi> at
other times would proſtrate her ſelf to <hi>Mazarine,</hi>
of whoſe departure ſhe was the greateſt occaſioner,
inſinuating this to be the moſt proper lenitive to the
Spirit of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who always received ſatisfaction
in compliance either to relax or endear him. Thus
was the <hi>French</hi> Court governed at that time. The
Cardinal, more than any man living, pierced into
theſe and the like Intrigues, and at length compaſſed
his ends by a profound ſounding of ſuch diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harcourt</hi> came back from S. <hi>Germans</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi>
where he had like to have been cruſhed by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
fury, not ſo much for having ſerved <hi>Mazarine</hi>
with care and faithfulneſs, but for having treated
with Sea-men, a moſt rude generation of people,
about hiring a Veſſel; who divulging the matter,
raiſed no ſmall Uproar, as though there were a Plot
about conveying away the King and Queen;
wherein I'le warrant you the Mariners were much
concerned. <hi>Mancini,</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Mazarine,</hi>
overtook his Uncle. His Nieces ſtole away pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately,
being committed to the care of <hi>Hocquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi>
and were brought to <hi>Peronne,</hi> as though the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:101520:137"/>
ruines of ſuch a Houſe could not lye in one place;
but muſt be ſcattered all the World over.</p>
            <p>Yet was not the Age ſo barren of Examples, but
that ſome diſcovered a ſtubborn loyalty kept entire
to the King and Queen, for whoſe cauſe eſpecially
it was, not <hi>Mazarines;</hi> out of the motives of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
intereſt, as the event teſtified: but the
Queen had made offers by <hi>Mazarine</hi> to all, even
the ſeditious, whatever the one and the other did
ſtrive to get, whether ſecretly, or by Mutinies, if
they would but have been quiet. <hi>But the French
have no patience to ſtay for whatever hopes they have
upon any grounds conceived, therefore they ſoon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

from ſtraight to indirect ways, then to crooked courſes,
and at laſt fall into precipices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Cardinal proceeded on his <hi>Norman</hi> Journey,
not environed with that Train, nor guarded with
ſuch a Troop as he was wont. Yet there attended
him <hi>d'Eſtrades, Pleſſe, Belliere,</hi> and about twenty
other Perſonages, not of the loweſt rank of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
with a Squadron of 200 Horſe, commanded
by <hi>Palvauſſe.</hi> Other Attendants uninvited with

both <hi>Bouillons,</hi> and all that retained upon that

the principal place, the Princes are declared to have
been wrongfully impriſoned. It is the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> to make Nocents
innocent, and again Innocents, nocent, that is, to
make and unmake Laws; and in one day declare
the ſame perſons Enemies of the <hi>French</hi> Court, and
admit them to be Confidents; boyſtrous Waves, and
immediately a Calm. From the beginning of its
being a Nation, theſe things have been, and will be.
The Elements do not change; and by theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
does our Kingdom ſtand, and will ſtand to the

of Parliament, not only foreign, but home-born
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:101520:144"/>
Cardinals, and Eccleſiaſticks in whatſoever degree
dignified, are rendered incapable of being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Members of the Kings Council, according to the
cuſtom of the wiſeſt of Stateſmen (who does not
underſtand the <hi>Venetians</hi> to be meant?) which cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly
and politickly bar ſuch from medling
with their Government. <hi>No man can pay a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Allegiance to his natural Sovereign, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of</hi> Rome; <hi>for Cardinals, if the account be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
caſt up, are but Curates in Purple; they ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the Conſiſtories, Biſhops the Charge of their flock,
which cannot be neglected without hazard of ſouls,
Corinth</hi> drew againſt the Bill, that only Foreigners
ſhould be excluded from the Government, leſt his
expected Hat, not being lined with that Miniſtry,
to which he aſpired, might be depreſſed by his
meaner contemplations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obuſſon</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Yverdon,</hi> in behalf of the
Clergy, made an eloquent Oration for the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of the Church; but without ſucceſs, becauſe
it was evident by whoſe inſtinct and impulſe he
ſpoke. Yet the Reputation of <hi>Obuſſon</hi> grew by this
means higher, and paved him a path to future pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments.
The main ſcope of his Oration lay in
amplifying the obligations that Cardinals had laid
upon <hi>France,</hi> whoſe good ſervices were conſpicuous
all over the World. The Parliament made anſwer;
<hi>They knew all that already; But withal, that the
ſame Cardinals were inſatiable in Ambition and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs
This</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>is incident to Eccleſiaſtical
Dignities, a ſlighting of heavenly matters, and an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation
of domineering on earth, and Eminency over
great Princes, and if it might be Kings; in all which
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:101520:144"/>
they write after the Copy, and come as near as they can
to the</hi> Roman <hi>Court, overcoming all in the World in
pride. How were it elſe poſible that a Frame built
non ſuch tottering Foundations, by ways contrary to
the Founders Insſtitution, could have been raiſed to that
height? That although it be plain, that it is riſen
by the Bounty of Princes, yet is their carriage more
evident, that they turn the greatneſs that they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
againſt their very Benefactors, and aim at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
leſs by their Canoniſts and Emiſſaries, than the
total depreſſion of the Secular Power. That theſe
Particulars having been ſufficiently marked by moſt
able men, can never be enough inculcated to check their
immoderate advance: which if it proceed, the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Presbyters and Church-men will become Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
of the World, and the Secular Power muſt be its
Lacquay, which is ſcandalous.</hi> The Parliament of
<hi>Paris</hi> can never be commended enough, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
boldly ſtands up againſt Eccleſiaſtical En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments,
and reſtrains the ſpreading thoſe Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacteries
too wide. Excepting the Senators of
<hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> all the reſt of the World bows in
ignorance to vain Superſtition.</p>
            <p>Such was the Fate of <hi>France</hi> at that time, as that
mens minds ſwelled with diſcontent, and the
whole State was griped with Inteſtine Seditions.
The <hi>Nobleſſe</hi> too had their Cabals and private
Meetings, writ Letters into the Counties, and
as it were ſounded an Alarm, and ſet up the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard
to fill up the meaſure of the new Faction;
<hi>That the publick Deſtruction muſt be prevented; that</hi>
France <hi>was run to ruine, the Government diſſolved;
that the States of the Kingdom muſt be ſummoned as
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:101520:145"/>
the only relief of the utter deſolation that was imepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
over the Land.</hi> The Queen tolerated theſe and
ſuch like diſorders, doubting more than need was
to meddle. <hi>Orleans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and <hi>Conde</hi> allowed and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
them; the Parliament condemned them as
prejudicial to their Authority. The Princes could
not well digeſt the hardineſs of the Parliament of
<hi>Paris,</hi> who interpoſed as Arbitrators of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in all State-affairs, under colour of a Supreme
Power. Hereat the great Leaders of the Houſe
grumbled, and interpreted it as a diminution of
their Priviledges.</p>
            <p>This Council of the Nobles would not leave
meeting, but ſlighted both Court and Parliament,
and joyned with the Clergy. Theſe flatter each
the other with mutual Remonſtrances, as if it were
both their grand Concerns, that the Kingdom
ſhould not be at all impaired. But the third Eſtate
which is of the-Juſticers and Lawyers drawing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, nor coming in, the Aſſembly of the
Nobles or the <hi>States General,</hi> as they are in our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
called, vaniſhed away, after great Conteſts
having already choſen their place of Aſſembling at
<hi>Tours,</hi> and in order to that already provided for
abating the price of Corn in that Country.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>Longueville</hi> had brought along with her
from <hi>Stenay</hi> the Furies of Revenge, by whole means
all the Country that was before her in perfect quiet,
broke out behind her with the Dragons and <hi>Hydras</hi>
of a moſt cruel War. One of her firſt publick Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
was the reſcinding the Articles of Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
her Brother <hi>Conti,</hi> and the Daughter of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Chevreuſe.</hi> Madam <hi>Chevreuſe</hi> had delivered
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:101520:145"/>
               <hi>Conde</hi> at his return the Paper wherein he had enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
his Promiſe for the future Marriage; withal
generouſly profeſſing, that ſhe would not go to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort
ſuch matters. And what, but that which is
noble, could be expected from the Line of <hi>Rohan?
Enguiens</hi> Match too with the Dutcheſs of <hi>Alenſon,</hi>
that had been in like manner interchangeably ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>per Verbum de Futuro,</hi> as the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh,
that it would come to nothing, <hi>Chevreuſe</hi> did
preſage, and commonly give out; nor was the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
miſtaken, as the event proved. That Madam
<hi>Longueville</hi> ſhould not conſent to the promiſed Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance,
no body wondred, that knew her diſpoſition,
who was only fond over her Brother <hi>Conti,</hi> whom
ſhe ruled by <hi>Rochefoucault.</hi> To have a young Lady
not unhandſom, born of ſuch a Mother, and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Corinth</hi> in her Train, to come into <hi>Condes</hi>
Houſe, ſeemed a troubleſom piece of Buſineſſ but
for <hi>Conde</hi> to diſoblige <hi>Chevreuſe, Corinth,</hi> and their
Retainers, who had ſo great an influence upon <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi>
the Parliament, and the City, did amaze ſuch
as were curious in Court-Politicks. What was his
meaning, I know not; this I know, that innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
miſchiefs were occaſioned by it. His Siſter
after her return, pondering in her mind the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of <hi>Spain,</hi> and wholly ſet on Revenge and War,
cared not what came of it, ſſhe might but inflame
and exaſperate her Brother, and thereby reduce the
Queen to fatal extremities.</p>
            <p>The Prince might by Cajoling and Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
have engaged thoſe that were already incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to him. But theſe were not <hi>Condes</hi> Methods;
therefore at the ſame time he loſt his old Friends.
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:101520:146"/>
               <hi>Bouillon, Thurenne,</hi> with not a few others, men ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
known, fell from him, and rendred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the King, being a great Acquiſt; Fortune
indeed ſhewing them the way to prefer an open cut
to ſolid advantages, before a by-path. The former
Set of Dependents going off from <hi>Conde,</hi> after the
King had culled the better, there remained <hi>Marſin,
Boutteville, Colligny,</hi> and <hi>Tavanne.</hi> This whole
Carriage was condemned as raſh; but the Prince
having already entertained a heart of withdrawing,
and having already trucked with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> by
his Siſter, at <hi>Paris,</hi> by <hi>Sillery</hi> at <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> and by
<hi>Croiſſy</hi> at <hi>Stenay,</hi> he did politickly throw off thoſe,
who, he was aſſured, would not ſtick to him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniard</hi> is now no longer ſecretly practiſed,
but openly from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> and from <hi>Bruſſells</hi>
to <hi>Paris</hi> the Road is beaten with <hi>Condes Courriers,</hi>
in whoſe and his Siſter <hi>Longuevilles</hi> houſe, <hi>Gabriel
de Toledo</hi> and <hi>Caſtillian</hi> Names ring. Never was
the King more ſaucily affronted. At <hi>Marle</hi> on the
Frontiers of <hi>Picardy,</hi> was a <hi>Rendez-vous</hi> about <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vain,</hi>
where the Forces of <hi>Conde</hi> were muſtered, and
received their Pay, and the Preſs-men were obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
They ſhould rather have trained at the <hi>Loyre:</hi>
Thus they would have divided the Kings Forces,
and the Prince would have been<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>apprehended every
where, as ready to fall in. At <hi>Marle</hi> the Troops
of <hi>Conde</hi> were handled rudely, which not being able
to ſtand the Choque of the Royaliſts were at laſt
routed.</p>
            <p>Nothing came more unexpected, nor more to
undeceive the Court; which was held in the dark,
than the ſuing for <hi>Guyenne,</hi> which <hi>Conde</hi> did ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:101520:146"/>
preſs, as that it might be eaſily underſtood
what was his meaning; yet was it granted him,
and <hi>Burgundy</hi> to <hi>Eſpernon</hi> in a change of pernicious
conſequence. It ſeemed ſafer to yield to that, than
upon denial of the requeſt, that <hi>Conde</hi> as Governor
ſhould both hold <hi>Burgundy</hi> under Command, by
vertue of his Commiſſion, and alſo <hi>Guyenne</hi> in the
affections of that Warlike people, which breathed
forth nothing elſe but <hi>Conde.</hi> But at the ſame time
to have a deſire that <hi>Provence</hi> ſhould be given his
Brother <hi>Conti,</hi> and <hi>Auvergne</hi> the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi>
and to pretend that both Countries were promiſed
him, as <hi>Conde</hi> did, was the firſt overtly preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Act after his Impriſonment, by which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
a contempt of the Government to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing
of the Queen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mazarine</hi> knew all at <hi>Bruell,</hi> and every thing at
Court depended upon his directions, where <hi>Conde</hi>
did ſollicit his Affairs, not his own. Nothing did
more effectually advance his return than ſuch pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices;
ſo that if the Prince had been <hi>Mazarines</hi>
Penſioner, he could not more uſefully have promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his Intereſts, who would have given a great
bribe to put <hi>Conde</hi> upon ſuch a Conduct of Affairs.
Therefore the Cardinal adviſed to yield <hi>Conde</hi> all
his Suits, and ſo cut off any occaſion of the leaſt
diſtaſte. Therefore by his advice were <hi>Seguier</hi> and
<hi>Chavigny</hi> too called up to Court, both of them affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to <hi>Conde.</hi> The former not patiently bearing
the intermiſſion of his Authority, this latter infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
earneſt after Alterations in the State, a large
Crop of which he procured by his ſubtile Counſels;
a Perſon brought up within the Tropick of the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:101520:147"/>
Court, could never ſit ſtill in private.</p>
            <p>At this time the Seals were taken from <hi>Chaſteau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuſ,</hi>
chiefly at the importunity of <hi>Conde,</hi> and were
given to <hi>Mole, Premier</hi> Preſident of Parliament,
without adviſing with <hi>Orleans,</hi> who upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation
of <hi>Corinth,</hi> with his Followers <hi>Montreſor</hi>
and others, fell into a great paſſion, moſt grievouſly
complaining of the Queens preſumption, that ſhe
ſhould offer to take ſo much upon her. <hi>What,</hi> ſaid
they, <hi>will this come too in time?</hi> Nay, <hi>Corinth</hi> went
ſo far as to adviſe the breaking open of <hi>Moles</hi> houſe,
and taking thence of the Seals.</p>
            <p>The poor Seals wandred up and down to requite
ſervice, either done, or to be done; and were no
longer a Reward of Vertue, but the Wages of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Such ſad times have we beheld. In three
ſo ancient men, was as long-lived, and not declining
ambition! <hi>Chaſteauneuf</hi> thought them his due, as
unjuſtly taken away; <hi>Seguier</hi> would hold them as
juſtly given him, <hi>Mole</hi> would get them as intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to merit them, ſuch power he had in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>While theſe and the like occurrents paſt, <hi>Longue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
and his Wife could not agree at all, through
old and late diſcontents, the cauſes of which were
ſo much the more bitter, as they were publick.
<hi>Conde</hi> interpoſes as Mediator, either to work re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation;
or having uſe of <hi>Longueville,</hi> to bring
him into theſe deſigns. Whatever were the cauſe,
he thought it his Intereſt to oblige the Wife, to be
obedient to her Husband, which he effected. But
among the Articles of Reconciliation agreed upon,
this being a principal one, that the High-born Lady
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:101520:147"/>
muſt leave the Town, and plant the Seat of her
perpetual Habitation in the midſt of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and
never more think of her dear <hi>Argos;</hi> ſhe not having
the patience to hold to ſuch a ſtrict condition, thruſt
forward her Brothers deſigns, which were not to
have been broached till ſome months after; that
ſo the Rupture before plotted, coming ſpeedily to
appear between the Court and <hi>Conde,</hi> ſhe might be
delivered from her <hi>Noman</hi> Retirement, which was
her earneſt deſire. <hi>Chavigny</hi> and <hi>Rochefoucault</hi>
were highly concerned for the Ladys ſufferings, and
put <hi>Conde</hi> into vain frights; <hi>That there were private
Conferences between</hi> Corinth <hi>and</hi> Lyonne, <hi>which
could not but be prejudicial to the Prince; that the
Guards were ſcouting about</hi> Condes <hi>Palace, as though
they had been upon ſome deſign.</hi> And the like ſtories,
which are wont to be aggravated by falſe gloſſes.
The Spirit of <hi>Chavigny,</hi> the Bellows of the Sedition
haſtned the Riot, not ſo much to ſave <hi>Conde,</hi> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue
him out of danger, for none there was; as to
carry favour with the Court, raiſing Troubles to
render himſelf neceſſary. Such was the mans ſenſe,
always to ſerve himſelf of <hi>Conde,</hi> and never to be
ſerviceable to <hi>Conde,</hi> by any means to inſinuate
himſelf into part of the Miniſtry, and having been
laid aſide, and after a ſort buried in obſcurity, and
being out of imployment to aſpire unto light and
buſineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conde</hi> by night withdraws himſelf with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Wife, and Siſter, and the Principal of his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
to his next Country-houſe, two miles out of
Town, called <hi>Sanmaure,</hi> as though he had eſcaped
a Plot; ſignifying by Letters to <hi>Orleans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:101520:148"/>
Parliament the cauſes of his withdrawing: The
Queen was troubled at his ſudden departure, and
affected pretence of danger, but ſought prudently
to ſtop events, and obviate imminent evils. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhe diſpatches to the Prince the Mareſchal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <hi>Grammont</hi> and <hi>Villeroy,</hi> provocations of his paſſion
thus ſhe endeavours to quench the firſt breaking
out, thinking it enough for effecting the cure when
ſhe knew where, and from whence came the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.
The Mareſchals return without being allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo much as Conference, but only in publick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conde</hi> grows more rough, the more he is feared.
He ſaith he can be ſafe no where, as long as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of <hi>Mazarine</hi> informed the State: that it acted
in <hi>Servient, Tellier,</hi> and <hi>Lyonne;</hi> that <hi>Bruel</hi> was no
longer the Seat of Baniſhment, but the <hi>Sibyls</hi> Cave,
whither Nations did flock from all parts to conſult
the Oracle, in the mean time the Prince adviſeth
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of his having already proſperouſly
begun his Enterpriſe, and practiſes his Plots with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſguiſe, images him friends, ſuch as were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

ſuch as were abſent by effectual Letters; <hi>Longue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
among the reſt, ſtrives by my application to
win over, not that he thought his Brother ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable,
but for <hi>Normandies</hi> ſake, and reputation
with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> as though he had been of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite

            <p>He had got <hi>Marſin</hi> his ſworn Creature the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince

might afterwards make the better bargain when
they come to be ſold to the Court. In the mean
time money is diſtributed to levy Souldiers. Nor
did they who received it, make good their promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
but went home, and vanquiſhed poverty. This

            <p>
               <hi>Servient, Tellier,</hi> and <hi>Lyonne</hi> being chaſed away,
<hi>Villeroy</hi> and <hi>Bryenne</hi> anſwered the ſhadow, but not
the ſubſtance of a Privy Council. <hi>Zongo Ondedei,</hi>
one of <hi>Pizarro,</hi> ſtrongly affected to <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who
took the courage to eſpouſe the Fate of the Baniſhed
rather than purſue his own; acted many things
ſtoutly and gravely, which might juſtly countervail
the cares of a Prime Miniſter: But lying under the
imputation of being an Alien, could advance no
higher, therefore inſinuated his Counſels under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
by other perſons. Thoſe openly deſigned
were <hi>Chaſteauneuf, Mole,</hi> and <hi>Vieville.</hi> The firſt as
Candidate of the Supreme Miniſtry, the ſecond as
Keeper of the Seals, <hi>Seguier</hi> being again put out of
Office, who was bandied like a Ball by this and that
hand, and the laſt deſigned for the Treaſury com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called <hi>Barboni</hi> (becauſe they wore long
Beards and Muſtaches turned up with Whiskers)
hated of <hi>Conde,</hi> as ſhall be related.</p>
            <p>But during this, <hi>Mercoeurs</hi> buſineſs took up the
Court and Parliament, who ſcarcely with the
Queens conſent rid poſte to <hi>Cologne,</hi> and was marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Archbiſhop, that Elector, to <hi>Mancina,
Mazarines</hi> Niece. Such aſſurance was there of
<hi>Mazarines</hi> being in Favour. The Parliament was
highly incenſed againſt the prohibited Marriage, at
the ſpecial inſtigation of <hi>Conde.</hi> All this fell out as
well as he could wiſh, and from thence was a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
occaſion to haſten his Enterpriſe, becauſe <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine</hi>
was charged ſtill to hold his Uſurpation.
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:101520:153"/>
Conde <hi>thought it his Intereſt to waſh off the Aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
caſt upon him, not ſo much out of any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
that he reaped by it, as to depreſs and baffle
the Queen and his Enemies. Therefore he extorts
from</hi> Orleans <hi>a Teſtimonial to compurge him of
the Articles charged upon him. It was read in the
Parliament;</hi> That the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> doth give
aſſurance that the Forces are kept at <hi>Marle,</hi> not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his conſent, who had ſent <hi>Valone</hi> thither to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<hi>Condes</hi> and his own Troops, not <hi>Seneterre,</hi> who
was a <hi>Mazariniſt;</hi> that he as Lieutenant General of
the Kingdom, had power ſo to do as to <hi>Stenay;</hi> that
<hi>Conde</hi> had always offered his ſervice to out the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi>
from it, either by ſtrength or policy. In a
word, that he had never obſerved any thing in the
Prince but a mind upright, and affected to the King
and Kingdom. To declare him guilty of high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for holding correſpondence with the Enemy, was an
ill adviſed act, which he was not acquainted with but
a few hours before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Such a Remonſtrance from</hi> Orleans <hi>troubled the
Queen, who, as ſhe was moſt skilful of diſſembling,
did yet conceal her reſentments.</hi> Orleans <hi>craved
pardon for what he had done, promiſing this ſhould
be the laſt kindneſs he would do</hi> Conde. <hi>It was
promiſed they would not foment diſcords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Although the Parliament and</hi> Orleans <hi>were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to judge</hi> Conde <hi>innocent; the Prince would
bear down his Enemies; therefore he publiſhes a</hi>
Manifeſto <hi>very brave indeed. After the Memorial
of</hi> Orleans, <hi>he needed no farther Apology, yet that
he might obviate ſcattered Rumors, and might ſtop
the mouth of Fame, and ſtiffle Diſcovery, he had
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:101520:153"/>
theſe few things to ſay for himſelf.</hi> That he held
nothing in <hi>France,</hi> but what was left him by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<hi>Stenay</hi> and <hi>Clermont</hi> were recompenſes for
the Admiralty of right devolved upon him by the
death of the Duke of <hi>Breze</hi> Brother-in-Law. After
thirteen months Impriſonment, that the Enlargement
might be called by him an Innocent, not a Favour, but
Juſtice. That he could not be excluded from the
Kings Council, whereof his Father had been appointed
the Principal by the Will of the late deceaſed King.
That he had not fortified his Party with Caſtles,
whereas on the contrary <hi>Mazarine</hi> had poſſeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of all the Forts in <hi>France</hi> by his Confidents. All
the Forces that he kept at <hi>Marle,</hi> were not ſo much to
be grudged at, whenas <hi>France</hi> owed to ſuch Troops as
thoſe the greateſt part of their Victories, and they were
kept a foot at the appointment of the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi>
who was legally inveſted in the power of ordering
thoſe Affairs. That he had changed <hi>Burgundy,</hi>
where his Eſtate was depoſited for <hi>Guyenne,</hi> that by
that means the poor Country might be relieved from
the Tyrannical Government of <hi>Eſpernon.</hi> That he
had with good reaſon kept the fortified Towns in
<hi>Burgundy,</hi> as having been purchaſed by his Father
with the conſent and allowance of the King. That
nothing was given him in lieu of them by <hi>Guyenne.</hi>
That <hi>Servient, Tellier,</hi> and <hi>Lyonne</hi> repreſenting
<hi>Mazarine,</hi> were juſtly removed with the Applauſe of
the Senate: but for his forbearing to come to the
King and his Council, that was commended by all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
men, whenas the Queen did avowedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

in his declared Enemies; that he muſt beware
of their Plots, that he might not fall again into their
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:101520:154"/>
Traps, wherein he had been once already caught. By
his Intelligence with the Enemy (with which he was
ſo much reproached) that he pretended nothing elſe
but the drawing the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of <hi>Stenay,</hi> which
had been his earneſt deſire from the very moment of his
Releaſe. That he referred all the reſt to <hi>Orleans,</hi>
who muſt either be ſcorned, or he muſt be credited. For
himſelf a Prince of the Blood to be declared guilty of
high Treaſon, at the Queens ſuggeſtion, was intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and he would not put it up. That the Givers of
ſuch cruel Counſel ſhould be ſearched out, and either
prove it by plain evidence, or be puniſhed. That he
ſubmitted himſelf and all his Eſtate to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and would ſtand to their Judgments. <hi>Conde</hi>
to clear himſelf or the Articles, if any were charged
upon him, and to ſtay ſecret obloquy, made his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
in the Parliament, moſt grievouſly complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the robbing of his Honour, earneſtly intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Members, that it might be repaired. The
wind favors him; therefore the more confidently
he inveighed much againſt the Counſellors, who
out of their implacable malice had deviſed theſe
curſed ways for widening the publick Breaches,
when they ought to be the Peace of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Corinth</hi> perceiving himſelf reflected on, ſtood up
and anſwered; <hi>That he had done nothing but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of the Publicly Good, and what became a
loyal Subject that had never broke his word.</hi> Conde
ſaid, <hi>He wondred that any ſhould be ſo bold as to
conteſt with him a Prince of the Blood.</hi> Corinth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
<hi>That he well knew what was due to ſuch a
Prince, but in that place entire obedience muſt be paid
the King only; every Subject had his liberty.</hi> The
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:101520:154"/>
Senators murmured, and foreſaw that exaſperation
might break forth into ſome dreadful outrage,
whenas the Houſe before the Senators eyes was not
ſurrounded, but filled with a Guard of Souldiers.
The Companies infenſe againſt each other with all
ſortſ of Arms, threatned ſome ſtrange Act of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity.
On the one ſide the <hi>Condeans,</hi> on the other
the <hi>Corinthians</hi> preſented their naked Swords, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a lamentable Spectacle in the Parliament-Houſe.
In the <hi>Guiſian</hi> times they would have
come to blows. In our Age there are many words,
but dry ones, and that fetch no blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether
it be that ſome bloodleſs Comet have blaſted the
temper of mens ſpirits; or whether every one were
afraid, while the matter yet was doubtful and
dangerous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mole</hi> Preſident of the Parliament admoniſhed;
<hi>That this was a place of Authority, not of Wrangling;
the riotous multitude on both ſides ſhould be diſmiſſed,
and the Senators left liberty of voting.</hi> Then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Conde; <hi>Your Highneſs ſhould by your good
Example ſhew the way of Reverence and Honour due
to thiſ Aſſembly.</hi> Immediately <hi>Conde</hi> receiving his
admonition, ſends out <hi>Rochefoucault</hi> to bid his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
be gone. <hi>Corinth</hi> himſelf goes and requeſts
the ſame of his. At his return, being caught by
<hi>Rochefoucault</hi> between the door and the Poſts, and
there near cruſhed to pieces, had almoſt rendred
himſelf a pleaſant ſpectacle to the cruelty of his
curaged Enemies. But that <hi>Champlatre</hi> by his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
releaſed the crowded Prelate. Thereupon
roſe a more grievous quarrel between <hi>Corinth</hi> and
<hi>Rochefoucault</hi> and their Friends. Theſe high com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:101520:155"/>
of Spirit were compoſed without blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.
Who would have believed it in ſuch a boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
time?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orleans</hi> moderated the ſwelling animoſity; nor
did <hi>Corinth</hi> come any more into the Houſe; and
<hi>Conde</hi> but with a ſmall Train. Such is the humor
of the <hi>French,</hi> that every one had rather pull the
State down with him, than be broken by his own
particular fall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conde</hi> the day after going from the Parliament-Houſe
to his own home, light in the midſt of the
ſtreet upon a ſolemn Proceſſion, in the Rear of
which, after the uſual faſhion came <hi>Corinth</hi> in his
Archbiſhops Robes. <hi>Conde</hi> made a halt, and falling
upon his knees, was content to be croſſed and bleſt
by <hi>Corinth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The people that ſtood about him murmured, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ready at his leaſt intimation to ſacrifice the
Archbiſhop to his Proceſſion. But there paſt
threatning words, an uncertain murmur, no blow.
One would have ſaid it had thundered without
rain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conde</hi> unacquainted with whiffling in the ſtreets,
and plotting higher things in his mind, about this
time is cleared in the Parliament from the charge
laid againſt him, as though it were falſe, at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Queen. What ſo weak a Subject could
at that time ſupply the defect of Royal Power? What
could a Woman do? She took patiently what was
impoſſible for her to redreſs.</p>
            <p>Some there were that entertained hopeful opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions

Not Confidents, but Vaſſals of the Cardinal,

did more nearly touch the Prince, was the fall of

Exchequer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conde</hi> had no juſter cauſe of indignation; nor
will any deny that, but he who is not inſtructed in
the qualities of the new-faſhion'd <hi>Barboniſmo,</hi> or Sect
of Whiskers; yet whatever the Prince complained
upon that occaſion, they who had good inſight in
thoſe Intrigues, well uuderſtood that he was glad
of it, having thereby a colour of withdrawing offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him, which he greatly longed after, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
engaged to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and ſo many
friends.</p>
            <p>But the day of the Kings Majority approached, at
which Solemnity <hi>Conde</hi> did not intend to aſſiſt.
Such like Feſtivals being not unfrequently polluted
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:101520:156"/>
with ſome act of cruelty; yet could he not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
be abſent. He makes uſe of my ſervice to

of the State, that he ſhould give <hi>Longueville</hi> a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

declined conference with <hi>Conde,</hi> leſt he ſhould
be inſenſibly drawn into a dangerous Confederacy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I diſpoſed him to yield his conſent to a Treaty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
when I had ſtudiouſly adviſed him by Letter, that
the Queen injoyned him to do it. <hi>Trie</hi> a Seat of
<hi>Longuevilles,</hi> a Summer days Journey from the City
towards <hi>Normandy,</hi> was the place appointed for the
Meeting, to different ends. <hi>Condes</hi> was, that he
might decently withdraw himſelf from the ſolemn
day, and withal might win to his deſign <hi>Longue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
who had hitherto by me given him ambiguous
promiſes: But the others aim was to avert the
Prince from his Attempts, and comply with the
Queen, who in truth neither regarded the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
nor the iſſue of it, uſing diſſimulation, and
and unwilling to abet her own being deceived.
Therefore firſt comes <hi>Longueville</hi> to <hi>Trie,</hi> and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the evening <hi>Conde</hi> attended but with a few,
taking his way through <hi>Pontoiſe;</hi> where he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
a ſtrong and ſtout Party, that if any Plot
ſhould be laid for him, he might get clear off. Nor
did he gueſs amiſs: For it was ſcarcely known by
Rumors diſperſed, that the Prince paſſed towards
<hi>Normandy</hi> by <hi>Pontoiſe,</hi> but Madam <hi>Eſguillione,</hi> who
was of very great power in <hi>Pontoiſe,</hi> offered her
aſſiſtance to the Queen for the ſurpriſing <hi>Conde,</hi>
which <hi>Harcourt</hi> alſo promiſed that he would exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute.
The Queen refuſed the proffer, either cut off
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:101520:156"/>
by the difficulty, and narrowneſs of time, or becauſe
ſhe apprehended worſe conſequences.</p>
            <p>The King with the Queen came into the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

of Friends, as all Novelty is ſpent in flattery. Thanks
were given <hi>Seguier,</hi> and promiſes renewed of
bringing him into his former Credit, which he
ſeemed to take well; for having found all things
generally ſucceſsful, if any adverſity did fall out, his
bearing it patiently prepared matter for his
praiſe.</p>
            <p>The firſt Action of the new King was to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Condes</hi> Forces at <hi>Marle, Guiſe,</hi> and <hi>Vervain</hi> a
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:101520:157"/>
little City between them, as though they were the
Enemies. They were partly routed, and ſome
ſlain, part under the Command of <hi>Tavan</hi> recovered
<hi>Stenay,</hi> the Sanctuary of the Wretches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orleans</hi> uſed all poſſible endeavours to obtain as
a favour the benefit of three days reſpit, which was
denied him. From thence was the riſe of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
War, which I ſhall recount in the following
Book more at large.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Condes</hi> not being preſent at the Inauguration of
the King, aſtoniſhed all men. <hi>Conti</hi> before the
proceeding of the Train, delivered the King a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
from his Brother, wherein he excuſed his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and promiſed unſpotted Allegiance to his
Majeſty. The King took it ſlightingly, and read
it not over.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When this was heard at</hi> Trie, Conde <hi>put of a face
of grief, to pacifie</hi> Longueville, <hi>who poſitively af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
that the Queen would ſet all this right in
time; dehorting the Prince by prudent Councils
from Civil War.</hi> For his Wealths ſake left him by
his Father, an Eſtate depoſited in ſure Banks, not on a

Hands of the King, whoſe Age now grew up to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
That civil War is a dreadful Beaſts which
hath eternally devoured its Followers. That ſuch
an Action hath this inconveniency attending it, as to
level all that are Acceſſories in the Guilt. That the
very Perſwaders of it will voluntarily return to their
Duty, when they are tired out with their preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and detect the fallacy by a treachery throwing
the <hi>Odium</hi> upon him. That by money received for
the uſe of the Wars, after they have a very little while
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:101520:157"/>
abated their domeſtical neceſſities, they ſhall bring
upon themſelves beggary afreſh. On the Kings ſide
there ſhines out a fair expectation of Riches, Charges,
Honours; that he might promiſe, but could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
any ſuch thing. Thereupon would follow a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
contempt in their Spirits, who ſeemed now
the Incendiaries of the Civil Diſcords. <hi>This and the

among a people that will flock in out of their very hate

and will come to the deriſion of the Parliament, and
trampling upon their Ordinances. What can you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
when torn from me, but deſtruction and ruine?
They fall upon me firſt, that they might more eaſily
come at you, whoſe Government they grudge at, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
near the City, and <hi>Mazarine</hi> deſigns it to himſelf.
<hi>Longueville replies,</hi> All that he held in <hi>Normandy</hi>
were weak Caſtles, neither ſupplied with Proviſion,
nor Men; that he had no Money, and his Authority
every day abated, wherein the ſtrength of War conſiſted.
Then, <hi>ſaith Conde,</hi> Do you forſake and abandon me to
Vengeance? I will never do ſo, <hi>ſaith he;</hi> Rather let
my whole Eſtate periſh: In all adverſities I will bear
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:101520:158"/>
you company, and run the hazard with you with all
my ſtrength. <hi>Hereupon they ſhook hands, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
their words, mutually: The Prince adds;</hi>
The <hi>Spaniards</hi> will ſupply money, the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> men.
<hi>At the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Name,</hi> Longueville <hi>the Off-ſpring of</hi>
John de Dunon, <hi>who gloriouſly chaſed that odious
Nation from the Bounds of</hi> France, <hi>ſtarted.</hi> I had
rather at my own charges, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> raiſe Souldiers.
But if the weight of the War ſhould be diſcharged firſt
upon me, I am not half able to ſuſtain the Royal Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques:
<hi>Conde anſwers,</hi> I will be with you, and march
ſpeedily in the Head of 2000 choice Horſe.</p>
            <p>Whether <hi>Longueville</hi> were inwardly touched, or
whether not having the confidence to deny <hi>Conde</hi>
any thing to his face, he promiſed all, in my ſingle
preſence. The Prince rejoyced that thereby he
added authority to the confederacy, and increaſed
in reputation with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but
when he ſaw all frowning upon him, he prepares
to withdraw the ſafeſt way he could poſſible; after
that the Conference at <hi>Trie</hi> was over, he retires to
his Houſe at <hi>Chantilly,</hi> avoiding to paſs by <hi>Pontoiſe,</hi>
apprehending the being laid for in his return, not
without grounds. I went back for <hi>Paris,</hi> to give
her Majeſty an account of what had paſt in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
and, to ſay truth, I ſpared <hi>Longueville,</hi>
whoſe promiſing <hi>Conde</hi> aſſiſtance, had it been revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
would have diverted the firſt Expedition of the
Court upon <hi>Normandy,</hi> and within a month have
reduced the Governor of that Country to extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which would have been not unwelcome to the
Prince. So ſmall a reſpit had been a vaſt benefit to
him, that muſt otherwise be ſurpriſed and cruſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:101520:158"/>
Coming to the Prince at <hi>Chantilly,</hi> I found him
melancholy for want of all things in the very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
for his War; no money, no men levied.
His Camp and Quarters uncertain; ſome hopes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
from the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> none from the <hi>Engliſh;</hi>
for <hi>Cromwell,</hi> a notorious Impoſtor, would give no
Categorical anſwer. Never was ſo great a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure
of buſineſs ſet upon ſo weak and tottering
foundations.</p>
            <p>As I was diſcourſing with the Prince in the Wood
of <hi>Chantilly,</hi> comes in a Courrier from <hi>Longueville</hi>
with Letters, wherein he expreſſed that he could
not attempt any thing in <hi>Normandy,</hi> till he had firſt
received the 100000 Crowns that were due to him
from <hi>Conde,</hi> and his Wives Jewels, by pawning of
which he might raiſe ſome ſum of money to defray
the firſt Charges of the War. From that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>Conde</hi> concluded that nothing was to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
for from <hi>Longueville,</hi> but what ſhould be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
ambiguous and inſignificant. For neither
would his Wife give her Husband the Jewels which
ſhe ſtood in need of for her own occaſions in this
Juncture, nor could the Prince pay the money he
was indebted to him, not having ſufficient for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to ſerve for his Journey to <hi>Guyenne;</hi> yet he
promiſed to do his endeavour, that he might be
plentifully ſupplied from the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> which <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueville</hi>
looked upon as frivolous, and would have
refuſed, had it been brought, being reſolved not to
take to the Party, but temporize, and never joyn
with <hi>Conde,</hi> till he had the better.</p>
            <p>The Prince no longer brooking deſtructive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays,
propounds to the Queen by an underſtanding
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:101520:159"/>
man equal conditions of agreement, to watch his
occaſion of getting away ſecurely, whilſt the Court
was entertained with fair promiſes. Therefore as
the Queen is ſcanning of them, he by long marches
having paſt the <hi>Loyre</hi> at the Town of <hi>Sully,</hi> rides
for <hi>Bourges,</hi> accompanied with ſome Troops of
Horſe; that famous City out of the memory of his
Fathers quiet retirement, receives the Prince with
all demonſtrations of forward ſervice, being ready
to do the ſame to the King coming ſpeedily after.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orleans</hi> leaving nothing unaſſayed, ſends to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerville</hi>
to bring back <hi>Conde,</hi> now running headlong
with offers of equal conditions in the Queens
Name. <hi>That he might continue at liberty in his
Government of</hi> Guyenne, <hi>and his Forces, which he was
ſo much concerned for, ſhould have Quarters allowed
them, and be ſecure from all violence and aſſault: all
which</hi> Orleans <hi>promiſed he would warrant.</hi> Conde
might and ought to have received theſe terms. For
had the Cardinal returned, he would have yielded
the Prince any thing, planted upon ſo many ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
beſides the favour of the Parliament, which
he would have acquired by this means; but if
<hi>Mazarine</hi> had failed of all hopes of return, he had
obliged to himſelf all <hi>France</hi> that drcaded the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſing
into civil Commotions. But Fortune, the
Empreſs of life, always making ſport at miſchief,
diſappointed the wiſeſt Councils: for the Meſſenger
of <hi>Orleans</hi> goes not to <hi>Augerville,</hi> where <hi>Conde</hi> then
was, in the County of <hi>Gaines,</hi> but to <hi>Augerville</hi> in
<hi>Beaux</hi> by a ſtupid miſtake. From whence ſprung ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
calamities. Near the ſame time <hi>Croiſſy</hi> ſent from
<hi>Orleans,</hi> overtakes the Prince at <hi>Bourges,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:101520:159"/>
the conditions already mentioned. <hi>Conde</hi>
anſwers he cannot yield his agreement to the offers
without adviſing with his Brother <hi>Conti,</hi> Siſter <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueville,
Nemours,</hi> and <hi>Rochefoucault,</hi> who were
hard by at <hi>Monte-Rotondo;</hi> therefore he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
the whole matter with them. Who with one
accord diſlike all that <hi>Croiſſy</hi> had brought, as being
unſound. <hi>That</hi> Guyenne <hi>doth already open her arms
to her expected and beloved Prince; the Country is
full of Souldiers, every where liſted in his favour.</hi>
Brouage <hi>and</hi> Blaye <hi>ready to revolt; the</hi> Spaniſh
<hi>Forces have already weighed Anchor from the Coaſt of</hi>
Guipuſcoa. <hi>That nothing is more baſe than to truſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
ſuch a Peace. For what can be expected from</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans
<hi>after breach of Articles? Should ſuch a power
of Nobility prepared for War, ſo many Commanders,
ſo many People in Arms be thus baffled. The Iron
muſt be ſtruck while it is hot. It hath been always
prejudicial to defer when matters are in a readineſs.</hi>
To theſe and the like was added a great ſtroke by
the Letters of <hi>Chavigny,</hi> who exhorted the Prince
ſeriouſly to War; <hi>That frivolous delays were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
till his heat ſhould be over, and then the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Prince, deſtitute of his Followers, ſhould be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed unawares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conde</hi> having reflected on all particulars, and
pondered ſo many events in his thought, conſented
to War, then turning to his Brother, Siſter, and
thoſe in Company, with his naked Sword, ſaith;
<hi>I drew this unwillingly, which will not eaſily return
into its Scabbard; he ſhall be the Rebel, he that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
me to be his Enemy againſt my hearts deſire.</hi> The
Quarter of <hi>Bourges</hi> being inſecure, this was done at

                  </gap>ce.</hi> Here did the Heavens firſt frown upon
<hi>Conde.</hi> Here did Fortune firſt change with breach
of Faith. Being always diſtracted with various
perplexities, he could hardly ſteal from labour and
anxiety any repoſe for his wearied eyes. He
goes directly for <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> to levy Souldiers, being
aſſured that the King would preſs on, and march
ſpeedily upon him. Before he went from <hi>Bourges,</hi>
he pillaged the Banks of the Cuſtomers; which
was the firſt Action of Hoſtility, a provocation of
miſchief.</p>
            <p>They ſay that the Prince in his Paſſage viewed
<hi>Xantogne. Xantogne</hi> is little in compaſs, commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
in ſituation, lying upon the Ocean, cut by
the <hi>Charenton;</hi> fruitful in Corn, and infinitely
abounding in all Commodities. It is beholden to
the richneſs of its ſoil, that it hath been the Scene
of great Actions. Beſides innumerable fights, of
which it is fanatically proud, that at <hi>Baſſay</hi> is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
wherein <hi>Lewis Bourbon</hi> the great Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of this <hi>Conde,</hi> the moſt famous Hater of the
Maſs, and Scourge of Maſs-mongers was ſlain.
The Prince had a great deſire to march over the
Field of Battel, and the Plain imbrued in the blood
of <hi>Condes,</hi> which as he rid over, his Sword fell out
of his Belt. An unhappy token in their Judgment,
who are taken with idle fancies, not verſed in Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who do confidently ſlight all Prognoſtications,
joyful, ſad, or ambiguous, and do not think that the
Divine Goodneſs hath ſuch concern for mankind,
as by theſe means to be willing to diſcover future
contingencies.</p>
            <p>The Prince received at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> not as a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:101520:160"/>
but as Soveraign Lord, and Arbitrary Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer
of them, being deceived with ſuch a flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſerenity, diſplaces the Prime Preſident of the
Parliament of <hi>Guyenne,</hi> as not being enough at his
devotion; ſurveys the Towns and Cities, recruits
his Troops, and fixes all for the future War, which
was to be removed indeed according to agreement
into poor <hi>Xantogne,</hi> lying too near to <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King without intermitting any time co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
with his Army to <hi>Bourges,</hi> finds the forward
affections of that ancient City; in favour of which
he ordered the high Cittadel (wherein the Duke of
<hi>Orleans</hi> afterward <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. had been impriſoned)
to be demoliſhed. By that means reſtoring to his
good Subjects their liberty, having overthrown that
ſhelter of Tyranny.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>Conde</hi> and Madam <hi>Longueville,</hi> with
their Followers forſake <hi>Montrond,</hi> an inſecure
Harbour, and come trembling to <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> to the
Prince. <hi>Palvauſſe,</hi> with a lingring Siege, takes, or
rather obliges to ſurrender the Caſtle, having been
ſome months held out by <hi>Perſane.</hi> For this nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
piece of ſervice he obtained the Dignity of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal
of <hi>France,</hi> which was given promiſcuouſly
in times of confuſion, and grew cheap.</p>
            <p>The Affairs of the Province of <hi>Bourges,</hi> being
duely ſet in order by <hi>Chaſteauneuf, Villeroy,</hi> and
<hi>Bryenne,</hi> who managed their buſineſs with wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

            <p>Now was all <hi>France</hi> hotly engaged againſt it ſelf,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:101520:161"/>
either as to Affections or Arms, with a divided ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

            <p>To ſuch an Attempt did the calamity of <hi>France</hi>
invite them, but eſpecially the miſerable condition
of <hi>Barcellona,</hi> where the raging Peſtilence laid low
innumerable heads, and every day Corps of old and
young were carried in throngs to the grave. But
the Revolt of <hi>Marſin</hi> was more peſtilent than the

the <hi>Spaniards</hi> privy to the intended Treachery, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

            <p>There was nothing that <hi>Guyenne</hi> did not hope

was no Souldier. This is <hi>Huguenot</hi>-like <hi>in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
not to prove unfaithful.</hi> The like was done at

of which Town was of great moment to the Relief

where the Grandfather of this <hi>Conde</hi> dyed by ill

            <p>At <hi>Bourges</hi> was a whiſper of <hi>Mazarines</hi> return;
all along the way of <hi>Poicters</hi> a murmuring; at <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
certain News of it. Nor had the Cardinal any

Dignity. It was for the publick Good, and muſt
no longer be delayed. One might ſee perſons nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd,

what they meant not, and not ſpeaking what they
mean, could not keep to themſelves their inward

<hi>That the Kingdoms ruine is haſtned,</hi> Condes <hi>Forces
increaſed, the Faction ſtrengthned,</hi> and ſuch like poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
hints, not according to rules of Court-ſubtility,
which prying into the future, never diſcloſes its
thought, keeping ſtill cloſe the ſecret ſenſe of its
ſoul. <hi>Bryenne</hi> is commanded to write Letters of
Revocation from his Baniſhment. How uneaſie
was that to him, who a few months before, had
adviſed <hi>Mazarine</hi> with too forward Counſel to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he might be more uſeful to
promote the Affairs of <hi>France</hi> in the Conclave.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal intent upon his future Journey, was
already got to <hi>Bouillon,</hi> debating with many what
ſhould be done; but what he would do, with very
few, or alone by himſelf; there being no better
Counſels than ſuch as are unknown.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hocquincourt,</hi> with <hi>Grancey</hi> and <hi>Navailles,</hi> were
the principal of <hi>Mazarines</hi> Counſel, all this way
ſtout in perſonal valour, perpetual deſpiſer of life.
<hi>Fabert</hi> ſubtle in his way, ſpyed what was likely to
be, and watched to make advantage of what was

was 6000 men in Arms, of great importance to
turn the ſcale at that time. The Cardinal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches
before him ſome of his Family with Letters
to his firm Friends, and others wavering, nay to his
fierce Enemies, making large promiſes. The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament

reſpectful to all, for qualifying mens prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate

Threſhold. He was ſecure by the watching of a
good Conſcience, and defended by naked Innocence,
the ſafeſt Guard, and Integrity an impregnable
Garriſon.</p>
            <p>The King and Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> came to meet him,
and next to the Kings ſide entred <hi>Mazarine</hi> into

contended about ſetting a due Eſtimate upon him.
<hi>Mole</hi> held the Seal ſubject to the pleaſure of the

Whoſe greatneſs none felt, but either to the relief
of his loſſes, or the enlargement of his Fortunes. Of
an unſpotted conſcience: His obliging carriage de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved

there were no Tales told thereupon: Nor yet did
his ſweet carriage, ſeaſoned with gravity, hide looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

the Kingdom being broke, the Armies of the ſame
Country-men offered the French Blood to be ſhed by

Conde, inferior to the Power of the Royal Army,
draws off into Flanders: Mazarine counterfeits a

things go croſs in <hi>Guyenne,</hi> whilſt <hi>Harcourt</hi> alarm'd
him at every turn, and the <hi>Spaniard</hi> fomented the
Diviſion by weak ſuccours, not ſerving the Faction,

ſuch is the humor of the Nation, not to like

nothing held for <hi>Conde,</hi> but <hi>Montrond</hi> that was
beleaguered, and therefore no longer in his Power.
<hi>Burgundy</hi> was ſo obedient to <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> that it would
omit no ſort of the meaneſt ſubmiſſion to gain the
favour of the new Governor, who equalled himſelf

returning to his Majeſties obedience by Surrender
<hi>Bellegarde</hi> and other fortified places, waited with
fear on the Kings looks. <hi>Bouillon</hi> and his Brother
<hi>Thurenne</hi> had how reſolvedly forſaken the Party of

Longueville</hi> carried himſelf ſo neutral and

own Intereſts, and ſeemed to watch his advantage,
and to ſhift his Forces, that indeed were but ſmall,

            <p>Beſides theſe publick oppoſitions, the Cardinal
was frequently ſhot at by ſecret ſhafts of envy in the
very Court, and that by thoſe on whom he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated
favours, and whoſe deſultory affections
the darkneſs of the Times did diſguiſe. Who by
their ſly poyſons inſinuated Rebellion into the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary,
after the Clouds were blown over turning
abject Flatterers. <hi>Mazarine</hi> plucking up the power
of his ſoul, acted couragiouſly, and defended the
ſleep of all with his vigilancy, the repoſe of all
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:101520:165"/>
with his labour, the leiſure of all with his activity;
in whoſe breaſt, though there were a deep wound,
yet there appeared no ſcar. In the mean while he
rendred all obedient with the awe of him, ſo that
they who had cruelly hated his former condition,
made profeſſion that they would follow this, though
with the hazard of their whole Eſtates. But we
ſhortly ſaw Fortune ſpeedily return to repentance
through ſo many proſperous ſucceſſes as enſued.</p>
            <p>The firſt debate was, whether it were better with
the whole power of the Army to overwhelm <hi>Conde</hi>
in <hi>Guyenne</hi> that was already tottering, or directly to
march for <hi>Paris,</hi> the principal City, and Head-quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
there to win <hi>Orleans</hi> who was wavering, and
either oblige the <hi>Slingers</hi> to return to their duty, or
ruine them. This ſeemed the more adviſeable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<hi>Harcourt</hi> at that time, ſtanding upon terms,
give ſome trouble, which I ſhall afterwards more
dearly particularize.</p>
            <p>The Army of <hi>Nemours</hi> plundering the Country,
put all into a fright, and laid the Circuit waſte
from <hi>Orleans</hi> by <hi>Gergovie</hi> and <hi>Giemie.</hi> It is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ſuddenly to quench that fire which was of it
ſelf inconſiderable, but as it miniſtred ſtrength to
the Faction. On the March, that the County of
<hi>Anjou</hi> ſhould be cleared by beating up <hi>Chabot.</hi> The
Service is committed to <hi>Hoquincourt,</hi> who within

to a neceſſity of Surrender, notwithſtanding
<hi>Beaufort</hi> had been ſent in by <hi>Orleans</hi> to his aſſiſtance,
and reduced <hi>Ceo</hi> and other Towns to extremity.
<hi>Chabot</hi> is of the higheſt Nobility in <hi>Xantogne,</hi> whoſe

had by his Wife, upon which he lived in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and had no affection to the Attendances on

for the gayneſs of his ſpirit, and comelineſs of his

There is a Bridge over the <hi>Loyre,</hi> a Poſte of great

with their blood, wiſh for War, but cannot be long

all theſe things in his mind, the diſcontents
between <hi>Beaufort</hi> and <hi>Nemours</hi> increaſing, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
longing after him, <hi>Orleans</hi> wavering, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
of the <hi>Sling,</hi> expectation of <hi>Paris,</hi> although
always fickle; but what was principally conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the preſſing admonitions of <hi>Chavigny,</hi> That he
would come up ſpeedily, and nut let ſlip the fair
opportunities that Fortune offered him; (although
hereby <hi>Chavigny</hi> more aimed at monopolizing the
Prince to himſelf, than at the promoting of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.)
Such reflexions produced in the mind of
<hi>Conde</hi> a determination to leave <hi>Guyenne,</hi> and having
reached his beloved Forces to draw up to the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
City. Thus hope being raiſed out of deſpair,
he haſtens to his wiſhes, and having left behind him
the ſubject of his fears, neither carrying his Wife,
nor only Son into danger, enters upon his Journey
with, but very few, that he had made acquainted
with his intention, through Foreſts and Deſerts, out
of the Road, ſcarce came under any roof, yet more
than once known by his face, though his hand were
held before it, and he had uſed all means to cut off
the marks to purſue and trace him. A Woman in
the train of the ſort of thoſe Ladies that are wont
to follow the Camp, had almoſt occaſioned the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the Prince, as he was taking a Bait in a
Country-Village. He eſcaped away and croſſed
the Coaſt, till wearied with wandring, he came all
duſty, ſpent with travel, and want of ſleep, into his
friends Camp, where he was received With ſound
of Drums and Trumpets. Scarce was lie diſmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:101520:167"/>
when being informed by Scouts how the Royal
Army was lodged, he falls in at midnight upon
<hi>Hoquincourt</hi> that ever was ſecure, beats up his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and rifles his Waggons and Baggage to great
Conſternation, little loſs. One might have ſeen
the Court at <hi>Giemie</hi> melancholy and dejected;
words were given out of truſſing up and marching
away, that the Bridge ſhould be broken down after
the King had eſcaped over at <hi>Bourges,</hi> and the like
which fear prompts upon a misfortune received.
The day after, both Armies ſtood drawn up, a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſe</hi>
parting them from Engagement. The Guns
being diſcharged on both ſides, <hi>Condes</hi> Party drew
off. <hi>Thurenne,</hi> who always tempered the forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſ
of the Souldier with Authority, Providence,
and Valour, acquainted with being in a proſperous
or dubious condition, and thereupon undaunted,
carried away the credit of that day, and confirmed
the drooping Army. There appeared his labour
in buſineſs, courage in danger, induſtry in action,
quickneſs in diſpatch. It may not be omitted that
the King being but fifteen years old, ſtole from thoſe
about him, and animated the Army with his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Geſture, which proved advantagious.</p>

ſigned by <hi>Mazarine</hi> in his Majeſties Name, and by
me in the Dukes at <hi>Giemie,</hi> which how they came
afterwards to be invalidated, I ſhall ſpeak in the
proper place.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Paris</hi> were boyſtrous Spirits, but that durſt
venture no farther than words. It was long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
in Parliament how the mony ſhould be raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for a reward to him that killed <hi>Mazarine,</hi> and
there was none found to undertake the Aſſaſſinate;
The Cardinal was not moved with any terror; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he wondered when the French were, embroyled
in Civil Warr that all-their Allies ſhould continue
firm, and no one ſtart. <hi>Orleans Conde</hi> and the
Parliament ſtill heaved at the Government. Whom
to reſtrain, nothing ſeemed more adviſeable then
for the Court leaving <hi>Giemie</hi> to ſettle at St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains</hi>
hard by the City. This was ſpeedily done.
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:101520:168"/>
And immediately Commiſſioners from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
and from the Princes attend upon the King
and tender him all ready duty. Here were appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
of intire Loyalty which repentance had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed,
and Rebellion diſarmed: but with unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Conſent they petition, that <hi>Mazarine</hi> the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of all the troubles might be removed.</p>
            <p>The King leaving St. <hi>Germains,</hi> made ſome ſtay
at <hi>Courbeil,</hi> and from thence goes and falls upon
the Princes forces at their <hi>Rendezvous</hi> at <hi>Eſtampes,</hi>
They having Barricado'd up the place, make a

who upon the approach of the <hi>Lorrainer</hi> is forced
to draw off and convey the King in ſafety to <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beil.</hi>
If ever the ſtrength of authority ſeemed to
have loſt its edge, it was in truth at <hi>Eſtampes,</hi>
where the King in Perſon having made an offer of
entry without ſucceſs, was more than once in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

            <p>After having quartered at <hi>Courbeil</hi> and <hi>Melun</hi> to

St. <hi>Denys.</hi> And that there would be put a period

the City growing more complyant, although the
Iſſue proved otherwiſe. <hi>Conde</hi>'s Army held St. <hi>Clous</hi>

The Royal Camp without the <hi>Seyne</hi> lying oppoſite,

            <p>While the <hi>Pariſians</hi> deny entrance into the City,
the Troops deſtined to the ſlaughter round the
Walls, which making but ſlow progreſs, by reaſon
of the vaſt circumference of the wall, <hi>Thurenne</hi>

the whole Court flocks thither. The King
attended by <hi>Mazarine</hi> could hardly be reſtrained
from entring into the Encounter. The end, ſaith
he, <hi>to the Civil Warrs which ye deſired is come.</hi> And
who could have doubted of it? The City had turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about to the Court, being weary of longer
bearing the inſol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The Shops of <hi>Paris</hi> being deſtitute of that
gainful trade which the King only ſuplies. The
face of the Camps was very different; On the Kings
ſide was Number, Valour, the Cauſe, and above
all, Majeſty preſent. On the Enemies, Terrour,
a faint Obedience between an infence City, and a
King eager in the purſuit of his denyed Rights.</p>
            <p>In truth <hi>Conde</hi> early in the morning coming

            <p>The Officers agreed, and all being prepared for
be extreameſt hazard, they fought from five in the
morning till five in the evening, with ſuch obſtinate
hearts on both ſides, that I queſtion whether ever
among the <hi>French</hi> there were an Example of a more
ſtubborn Conflict. Under the Walls of the City the
Citizens looking on, and waiting for the Iſſue. The
Daughter of <hi>Orleans</hi> was no weak ſtay of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
whilſt with a manly forehead ſhe inflames the
<hi>Pariſians</hi> for <hi>Conde,</hi> whilſt ſhe diverts the Common

<hi>Conde:</hi> laſtly whilſt ſhe heartens her Father, and
carries him along the ſtreets appearing to all. The
Bulwarks in the Suburb were the matter in diſpute.
Thoſe were caſt up by the Townſmen againſt the

Souldiers. One might have ſeen from <hi>Piquepouſſe</hi>
to S. <hi>Denis</hi> diſmal ſlaughters; <hi>Sanmagrine</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tini</hi>

Of the Party <hi>Nemours</hi> and <hi>Rochefoucault</hi> came back

wounded and half dead. The Port of S. <hi>Anthony</hi>
being clear, <hi>Conde</hi> with his mangled Retinue comes
into the City, having ventured at that which could
not have been effected but by a moſt valiant man.
Great every where, but greater than the reſt where
the danger was great; in this S. <hi>Anthonies</hi> fight
greater than himſelf. One could not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to admire him more either when he exceeded
all meaſure in running upon dangers, or when he
kept within the bounds of admitting due praiſes.
Here he rejected Applauſes, and would not avow
his own labours, bur infinitely valued other mens,
ſo different was he after Victory, from what he was
in fight.</p>
            <p>What was more cruel in the afflicted City,
than to ſee <hi>German, Wallon,</hi> and <hi>Lorrain</hi> Troops
march up and down with drawn Swords, as
though the King had been conquered, carrying
along with them flocks of Harlots and <hi>Scythian</hi>
Waggons, yet had that odious crew Billets aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them in the places adjacent to the Suburb of

of <hi>Paris.</hi> Theſe Plantations the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Souldier held after that he had plundered <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lejuvive,
Vitry,</hi> and other Towns. There were not
wanting ſome Illuſtrious Families too, which freely
ſent in Proviſions to them when they ſwaggered,
thereby to redeem their being pillaged.</p>
            <p>But that nothing might be wanting to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Frenzy, the Faction appeared wearing its Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours;
then which Faction there, being nothing in
Nature more ſlight, the vileſt of things, Straw, was
choſen for a Standard of Sedition. Yellow ſtraws
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:101520:170"/>
were plaited into the Noſegays of the gallanter
ſort. Carts, Coaches, and Saddle-Horſes came
not forth without a Lock of ſtraw ſtuck on them;
nay, the very Mouks had ſtraw on their Cowls.
They that were Chaff-leſs, or Straw-leſs were
beaten; in an unuſual Subject I muſr uſe an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual
Term. Such a Straw-Triumph was odious
to the good, and imported no good Wheat, nor the
Seed-plot of any good fruit. The City breathed
after nothing but Loyalty and due Obedience to his
Majeſty. <hi>Orleans</hi> with his Complices wavered.
The Court increaſed by new acceſſions. The <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
with <hi>Longueville</hi> deteſt War. The <hi>Spaniards
by Fuenſaldagne</hi> enter indeed <hi>France,</hi> with a pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous
Camp. The Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi> concludes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand
with <hi>Mazarine.</hi> In <hi>Guyenne Condes</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
weakens. In a word, all things go croſs. No
hope is left but in the Union of <hi>Paris,</hi> with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and Princes, which ſtriking terror with its
empty ſound, may bring the King to a Treaty of
Peace, wiſhed for and purſued with earneſt vows
on all hands.</p>
            <p>It was <hi>July</hi> 4. 1652. when there met in the
Town-hall the chief men, <hi>Hoſpital</hi> Governor of
<hi>Paris,</hi> and the <hi>Provoſt</hi> of the <hi>Merchants</hi> preſiding af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the uſual manner. There came in <hi>Orleans</hi> and
<hi>Conde,</hi> with innumerable Followers at four in the
afternoon. They were received honourably by
<hi>Hoſpital,</hi> who ſeeing that famous Tuft of Straw in
<hi>Orleans</hi>'s Hat, could not refrain from ſaying; <hi>Why
do you come into his Majeſties Room, wearing a Badge
of Sedition? Orleans</hi> without any reſentment an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<hi>All will be well.</hi> The Court was ſcarcely
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:101520:171"/>
met, when there comes in a Trumpet from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
with a Letter, wherein he teſtifies that it
would be pleaſing to him, if the Court were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed
till four days after.</p>
            <p>So ſmall a ſpace could not be denied the King;
the Court is diſſolved, the Princes return, whom as
<hi>Hoſpital</hi> waited on a ſuborned Raſcal offered him a
Tuft of Straw, in ſcorn, or to watch an opportunity
of Sedition, which was wiſhed for. <hi>Hoſpital</hi> ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to the quality of his place, and after his wonted

you out at window, which I ſhould command to be
done, did not the Dignity of this honourable Perſon</hi>
(he pointed at <hi>Orleans) bridle my juſt indignation.</hi>
The Princes had ſcarce got into their Coach, when
there fell ſhot with a Musket, either by chance, or
upon deſign, ſome unknown Fellow, mixed with
the vulgar Rout, which with Weapons and mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
words thronged about the Town-houſe. Some
affirm among thoſe that abuſe their leisure, that it
was done with a miſchievous intent. Nor are there
none that witneſs it to have been by the Order of
the Princes, that the deſired Union might be either
perſwaded, or forced. However the truth be, a
great deſtruction ſprung from thence. The crowd
of men in Arms lying under the Windows, crys
out; <hi>That</hi> Mazarines <hi>were locked up there, and
did hold very bad Councils; that the deſtruction by
their means hangs over the City. A Citizen they
had already killed. Some great misfortune is to be
expected; that Fagots would be fetched to lay the
Houſe flat with avenging flames.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of a ſudden the common Rout fall on fiercely
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:101520:171"/>
with Rage, Arms, Fire, and Fagot. The forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
are ſlaughter'd, others ſtifled with ſmoke, the
Houſe is ſtormed: that ſeemed the fatal day of <hi>Paris.</hi>
Thoſe that were potent in Faction ſtrengthend
the Confuſion. Companies of Souldiers are drawn up
to the City-Walls. The Town-houſe-wall is
boiled with flames, ſo that the ſmoke rolls in a
gloomy Cloud; and had the wind then ſpread the
burning, the <hi>Greave</hi> would have been involved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
already ſcorched all over with the diſmal fire,
which as the Will of God was, mounted hot aloft,
but had its power confined to the lower Region. It
ſeems after ſo many hazards of the poor City, this
Game had been left unplaid. They, were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to have eat up the Citizens; They muſt burn
them too. Whilſt the Conflagration and Riot laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Conde</hi> aſſayed to in, <hi>Orleans</hi> held him, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
leſt the Prince might come to any miſchance by
the popular Commotion. <hi>Orleans</hi> his Daughter
came in like a ſtout <hi>Virago,</hi> when the Tumult was
appeaſed, and the fire abated, every one went home
to his houſe. The flame indeed, was quenched, but
the memory not buried, which will live for ever in
their minds. And both Princes burnt not the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the City, but his own hopes. <hi>Hoſpital</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
eſcaped the danger in a diſguiſe, left his Houſe
and the City, and retired. <hi>Beaufort</hi> is made Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
of <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Brouſſel</hi> Provoſt of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants

time; the Kings Army in that Neighbourhood
being in want of Proviſions, the Court it ſelf
ſtraightned, and diſeaſes ſpreading by reaſon of the
ſoultry Dog-days, <hi>Pontoiſe</hi> is cholſen for a fit place
of Reſidence. Thither the King on the ſudden
conveys himſelf; (it is but three hours Journey) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
left the Parliament-Commiſſioners at S. <hi>Denis,</hi>
whom, upon the Poſt, <hi>Orleans, Conde,</hi> and <hi>Beaufort</hi>
conveyed into <hi>Paris.</hi> But when very many of the
poor Parliament-men, fearing their Eſtates, having
left the City, wandred about unſetled, by the advice
of <hi>Fouquet</hi> Procureur General, the Members of the
ſcattered Court are gathered at <hi>Pontoiſe.</hi> The late
Ordinances diſannulled, and, new ones erected. The
ſhadow and appearance of a Parliament remaining
at <hi>Paris,</hi> frets at this, and declare <hi>Orleans</hi> Viceroy,
and <hi>Conde</hi> General: which was not only at Court
diſallowed of, but at <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> the Metropolis of

               <hi>Orleans</hi>'s Government. The rigid <hi>Provenzals,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
of a ſtiff uprightneſs, know not how to bow
but to that which is equitable. No People is more
obſtinate in their Loyalty.</p>
            <p>The new Viceroy ſetles him a new Council, the
principal Members of which were <hi>Conde, Seguier</hi>
Chancellor of <hi>France, Chavigny,</hi> the Dukes <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foucault,
Rohan, Briſſac, Sully,</hi> and others; <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi>
and <hi>Nemours</hi> contending the one with the
other, preferred a Duel before the Council, in which
they decided the Quarrel at the <hi>Port Richlieu.</hi> The
Bellows was of a Womans luſt. <hi>Nemours</hi> ſhot mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
by his Brother-in-Law <hi>Beaufort,</hi> fell rather af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Fate of his Family than his own; a man
ſtout to a degree beyond Valour; of a life ſuitable
to his death; born to oblige the World.</p>
            <p>Nothing was more empty than that ſhadow of
<hi>Orleans</hi>'s Council, which ſoon vaniſhed away. Their
firſt buſineſs was to raiſe money upon the City.
<hi>Condes</hi> Forces were in extreme neceſſity, who
(though they might have been rich with their pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laging
and plunder) yet what they got ill, ſpent
worſe. Therefore a remedy of their want is found
out far more deſtructive than their very want. A
Tax was laid upon every <hi>Porte Cochere,</hi> or great
Gate for a Coach to go in at, at which the City was
greatly incenſed, reſolving to fall foul upon the
Adviſers, and throw off the Impoſition. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
with a great part of their Parliament foreſee
the ſtorm hanging over them from the Court
and City; which <hi>Conde</hi> reſolves to leave, thinking

at S. <hi>Germans</hi> by <hi>Rohan</hi> and <hi>Chavigny</hi> in favour of

their Followers, who were not a few, ſecretly

            <p>
               <hi>The Parliament at</hi> Pontoiſe, <hi>wholly devoted to</hi>
Mazarine, <hi>adviſeth with an unbiaſſed Council;</hi> to
depart and throw the whole blame upon <hi>Conde;</hi> that
the Prince would hold on the ſame courſe of diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that he had begun, and draw the <hi>Odium</hi> of the
Kingdom upon himſelf; and that at length with their
univerſal conſent, when the Faction was tired out, the
Cardinal ſhould return to his former Luſtre, ſole Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nager
of the State, with the Applauſe of <hi>France. At a
moſt ſolemn Meeting his Majeſty is requeſted by
Commiſſioners from the new Parliament in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated
Oration, that the Cardinal in favour of
Peace to heal the Nation, might depart the Land,
and that he would gratifie all his good Subjects in
granting this Suit of theirs;</hi> Mazarine <hi>anſwers,</hi>
He was ready to obey, and would willingly leave the
Miniſtry, if their rage might but ceaſe, who feed upon
the Countries ſpoils; that he had been Delinquent,
neither in corrupting others, nor being corrupt: had
not deviated from the path of Honour and Conſcience
in the leaſt; had not poyſoned the ears of the beſt of
Kings againſt his Subjects; had not brought ſcadals
into the Court, but by a conſtant tenour of his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
inſinuated clemency: and that the Government
ſhould be tempered according to the Genius of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
that Terrour is the wrong way of acquiring Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
among the <hi>French,</hi> the moſt firm Dominion
over them, is ſuch as wherein the Subjects find content.
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:101520:173"/>
They need fear nothing, if they have union of hearts
among themſelves; this he would procure them by his
abſence, and quench the fire by withdrawing. Laſtly
it is not reaſonable that a Kingdom, ſtrong in Forces,
rich in Commodities, renowned in Glory, ſhould for his
ſake periſh.</p>
            <p>Amidſt theſe ſtorms, the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> dies at
<hi>Pontoiſe,</hi> deſtined to have been the ſecond Neck to

uſed all poſſible means by not bearing, and by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
Troubles, to have plunged himſelf in unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable

            <p>After that <hi>Mazarine</hi> had earneſtly inſinuated

EIGHTH BOOK
OF THE
Hiſtory of FRANCE.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>The CONTENTS. France opening its eyes begins to acknowledge its Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
and the deceitful Snares of the Princes. The
Faction declines. His Majeſty returns to the City.
The Parliament recovers its Authority, that of
Pontoiſe being determined. Orleans withdraws
without waiting on the King. The wearied Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath no where to ſet its foot, being without a
Leader. Yet the Tide is ſtill upon turning, till
the Return of Mazarine, wherein every thing is in
good earneſt ſetled.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE <hi>French</hi> Necks uſed to the Harneſs, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
long ſtart from their accuſtomed and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Yoke, therefore what ſo many calm
Advices could not perſwade, nor could menacing
terrour extort, only Loyalty without any external
impulſe did obtain, being knit by repentance much
ſtronger, then if it had been skinned over by untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
remedies. But what could the Commonalty
attempt when the Princes were away? Even the
ſame, as the Sea, calm of it ſelf, when the Winds
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:101520:174"/>
are ſtill. In nothing did the policy of <hi>Mazarine</hi>
appear greater than in the not aggravating of faults,
and not breaking of the Lute-ſtring that jarr'd, but
bringing it by degrees into Tune. <hi>Paris</hi> by inſtinct
and in a heat calls for its King. There are meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Citizens in the <hi>Louvre</hi> to find out means
for ſuppreſſing the Faction, nay, they fall upon the
marks of it. For thoſe that wore Straw, were
all about the Streets pelted or abuſed. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
ſuch as had returned to their Allegiance ſtick
ſcrowles of paper in their Hatts, in token of their
Loyalty to the King.</p>
            <p>The Court having broke up its unſatisfactory
reſidence at <hi>Pontoiſe,</hi> retired to <hi>Compiegne,</hi> whether
ſlocked an innumerable concourſe of Nobles, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,
Commoners. <hi>Peter Seguier</hi> the Chancellor
ſecretly ſlipt out of the City in diſguiſe. I know
not by what ill luck he was Preſident of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Counſell againſt his will; yet would have ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
wholſom advice: He was received grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
by his Majeſty at <hi>Compiegne,</hi> and afterwards
had the Seales reſtored, which none kept with
more integrity, uſed more diſcreetly, or held a
longer time. An humble addreſs is voted in the
Town-houſe whereby the King ſhould be petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to return.</p>
            <p>The Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> although it ſeemed to
ſlight that vain appearance of the Court held at
<hi>Pontoiſe;</hi> yet took it for a diminution; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
by having their Authority divided. Now
the ſecret was divulged that the Parliament is not
confined to the walls of <hi>Paris</hi> only: and that there
is no ſurer Law, than that the King may do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:101520:175"/>
ſoever he pleaſes to do. Therefore is Juſtice
drawn an Aſſeſſor to Majeſty, undoubtedly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe whatſoever is ordered by, the King muſt be
judged legal.</p>
            <p>But the very Parliament men were inclinable to
the Kings return, and had already given thanks
for the removing <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who was called the
<hi>Rock of Ofence,</hi> the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>Occaſion of
the Troubles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although <hi>Conde</hi> ſtrong with the <hi>Lorraine</hi> and
<hi>Wittemberg</hi> Forces held <hi>Thurenne</hi> at <hi>Villeneuve</hi> of
St. <hi>George</hi> in a manner blocked up, the Kings Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
being there reduced to extremities: yet ſuch is
his foreſight, that he plainly perceived, that he
could not longer ſuſtain the ſway of all <hi>France,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyling
to its obedience, nor be able to ſtand the
aſſault which ſuch a power menaced. Leaſt he
ſhould be overwhelmed on the ſudden with that
vaſt weight, and all way of eſcape cut off, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats
with his men into <hi>Flanders</hi> by <hi>Champaigne:</hi>
ſo much the more willingly becauſe <hi>Thurenne</hi> had
got away in the night, having left fires burning in
his Camp, to conceal his departure. Indeed the
Cardinal the matter of War being gone, <hi>Conde</hi>
could hope for nothing more from the People, leſs
from the <hi>Sling,</hi> the head of which, <hi>Beaufort,</hi> was
quite out of credit with the Faction. <hi>Orleans</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
weary of his Labour and Arms breathed after
nothing elſe but reſt. Upon theſe effectual argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>Conde</hi> on good grounds withdrew from
imminent dangers, beſides that being ſo linked to
the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in Bonds of Aſſociation, that he could
upon no terms ſtir from his Articles with them.
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:101520:175"/>

ſuch as are ready to revolt, with a vain ſhew of

the ſimple world. If there be caſt up the
charges, fortune of the Sea, and the like, a little
Gold is purchaſed at a great deal of Gold.</p>
            <p>At this time died <hi>Leo Bouthillier Chavigny,</hi> in
a flouriſhing age, but not eſtate. Having left the
Kings high way, he went into a miſleading path.
Proſperity he received thankfully, adverſity not ſo
patiently. He might have reſted upon internal
goods of his Soul, and been prepared againſt the
acceſſories of Fortune. A little before his laſt, he
devoted himſelf openly to Religion. It is grown
a practiſe of late years among the <hi>French,</hi> that they
who miſcarry in their deſigns turn Religious.
<hi>Vetaries they are commonly called for palliating their

life.</hi> Thus died <hi>Chavigny,</hi> mortifying himſelf not
only with Religion but alſo with a more ſtrict diet.
By the ſame Arts haſtning his death, as Life is
wont to be prolonged. If there be any levity in
the ſpirit, it is puffed up with felicity, which upon
the turn of favour is abyſs'd. A fault of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
condemned and ſtill maintained. From ſuch
eaſineſs of fortune, what do not we daily ſuffer,
and that undeſervedly.</p>
            <p>During theſe troubles, <hi>France</hi> loſeth the Sea-Coaſt
of <hi>Flanders, Gravelin,</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and
other neighbouring Towns, which are born away
by the ſame torrent of Fortune, having been

            <p>But <hi>Barcellona,</hi> the chief Town of <hi>Catalaunia,</hi>
renders it ſelf to <hi>Don Juan,</hi> ſo often happy, and

By ſuch diſmal overthrows, <hi>France</hi> might

the favor of his enlargement and his obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to <hi>Conde,</hi> diverted himſelf on Balls and Tourna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
His attempt of a ſecond progreſs into
<hi>Naples,</hi> was a bravado to renew in his light mind,
by way of vain deriſion, thoſe hopes taken down
to the very ground. None in the world ever fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſuch idle dreams, that was deſcended of Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,
who aimed at ſo lofty and ſo ſolid matters.
<hi>Monce</hi> reduced by a lingring ſiege to an extream

            <p>The publich Joy, and Feſtival Acclamations, for
the returning of the King into the City, cannot be

The more obſtinate Senators chaſed out of the

            <p>
               <hi>Orleans</hi> went not to meet the King, when he

Retired to <hi>Limour,</hi> thence to <hi>Blois,</hi> to the end of

            <p>
               <hi>Harcourt</hi> ſo often daring, grows cold, grudges
at the orders of the Court, which he complained

that <hi>Tilliadet</hi> was obliged to go from thence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any notice taken of the Kings order. What
ſhould be done in ſuch a doubtful point? The
Garriſon is courted by the Emperour the ancient
Lord, by the <hi>Lorrainer,</hi> by <hi>Conde.</hi> The Widow
of <hi>Weybrantz</hi> enraged with a ſting of Ambition,
I will add and gain, interpoſes to reconcile the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
at difference: She comes to <hi>Briſſac</hi> with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
by all means of obliging the Court to her,
and <hi>deſtroying Charlovoy.</hi> By the ruine of ſuch a
perſon, the vain woman had preſumed upon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
no ſmall reward. She puts upon her hook
the bait which ſhe knew he would bite at. A Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs,
is made the decoy: to viſit whom the poor
man goes out of the Caſtle. The Act of <hi>Charlovoy</hi>
was as weak, as that of Madam <hi>Weybrantz</hi> was foul.
Whileſt he trapanned by a woman is conveyed to

               <hi>Harcourt</hi> was Governour of <hi>Flesburgh;</hi> a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
entirely affected to him. There <hi>Charlovoy</hi>
being exceeding courteouſly entertained, becomes
obliged to him, who abſent in <hi>Guyenne,</hi> diſguſted
with the unfaithfulneſs of the Court, deſigned to
get <hi>Briſſac</hi> to himſelf, and <hi>Charlovoy</hi> liberty. They
enter covenants. <hi>Harcourt</hi> withdraws from <hi>Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne,</hi>
and is received in <hi>Briſſac</hi> by <hi>Charlovoys</hi> means.
After diverſe terrors, after variety of hopes propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
at length he conditions with the King. He
comes forth of the Garriſon ſurreptitiouſly gotten,
is preferred to the Government of <hi>Anjou,</hi> Dignity
of Conſtable, and a Church Revenue: Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and fair conceſſions are made to <hi>Charlovoy.</hi>
Madam <hi>Weybrantz</hi> hated on both ſides, ended
her reſtleſs days with the Spleen and Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.</p>
            <p>At a ſolemn Pomp <hi>Rhetz</hi> went to <hi>Compiegne</hi> to

of paſt miſcarriages, and credit for the time
to come. The Queen appoſitely anſwered, <hi>What

The Prelate might have preſaged what was
impendent. He never fearing his Eſtate, eternally
deceived by falſe friends, through the humors of the
Pulpit, through the Complements of the Court,
through the Faction of the People, whilſt he ſeems
to triumph, being in the <hi>Louvre</hi> arreſted by <hi>Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quier,</hi>
is caſt into the Priſon at <hi>Vincennes.</hi> Several
Treaties were for the Releaſe of the Priſoner. At
length he was brought to <hi>Nants,</hi> and made his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
bravely. He aſſiſted at <hi>Rome,</hi> not without
Reputation, at the Election of <hi>Alexander.</hi> From
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:101520:178"/>
hence returning to <hi>France,</hi> he voluntarily laid down
the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Paris</hi> to gratifie the King.
He lives quietly, in Splendour ſuitable to his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition;
what he is to do at <hi>Rome,</hi> the ſequel of the

            <p>After <hi>Rhetz</hi> being in Priſon; <hi>Conde</hi> a Stipendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in <hi>Spain; Orleans</hi> at <hi>Bloiſe</hi> either praying in the
Church, or hunting in the Woods, there could not
chuſe but be ſecure Peace. Theſe three more bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than the reſt made up the Tragedy, but at the

right. Theſe others having a womb neither hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py

Having compaſſed leſſer deſigns, ſtill aimed at
greater, and always ſecretly applied by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidents

yet would betray one another. Thus was <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>
the Arbitrator not of three, but four wanton
Goddeſſes.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the beginnings, theſe the grounds of
the civil War. The manner of carrying it on was
very bad. Civil Arms can neither be raiſed, nor
held by good practices: and farther the aim of
them was unſound: for the Commanders pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Publick Good, every one contend to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
his own power. They fight on both ſides
for Rule. I take him to be the better Citizen and
Man, that would endure any torment, rather than
not only to be a Principal, but an Acceſſory to ſuch
cruelty. If you are obliged to meddle and take
party, look it be with this condition, that it may
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:101520:178"/>
appear a Wiſe-man, as you do againſt your choice
undertake it at firſt, and have no will to ſtand it out
to the laſt. And always be of this Judgment, They
who commit themſelves to theſe Waves, are no
more in their own power, than they who are toſſed
upon thoſe at Sea. This is our Determination in a
controverted caſe, wherein I ſoon underſtand that I
have not contented ſuch as are haſty to take up
Arms.</p>

He keeping the command of his Face, but admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

is re-admitted into his former Charge, and
wheels cleverly about from hatred to favour. When
there was any matter of Puniſhment or Reſtraint,
the King puts others upon it: whatſoever Rewards
or Preferments were to be beſtowed, he reſerved
that to paſs the Cardinal, who being before all
things concerned for the Treaſury, vacant by the
death of <hi>Vieville,</hi> put in <hi>Abel Servient</hi> and <hi>Nicolus

grow rich, he run in debt. He died in the Office
honourably, having empaired his eſtate. <hi>Fouquet</hi>
under a neglected Garb, ſhrowding a vaſt Spirit,
not unmindful of his Friends, but of his Enemies,
at <hi>Lucullus</hi> like charges, maſtered Nature, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blidged
a moſt diſadvantagious Scituation, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

            <p>Such a choice of <hi>Mazarine</hi> to the management
of the Treaſury, did not ſcape cenſure in a City
which ſpares no body. Then was that famous
word of the Chancellours given abroad. <hi>Whatever

Some through profuce Riot will laviſh out the

            <p>His principal care was over <hi>Guyenne,</hi> which if it

That charge is committed to <hi>Vandiſm</hi> the Admiral.
A Fleet was neceſſary, principally becauſe of the

<hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> that he rejected with ſcorn the repeated
Embaſſies of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and courted the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of the <hi>French,</hi> uſing the negotiation of <hi>William
Lockhart</hi> was to conclude the new confederacy. This
<hi>Lokhuart</hi> for his piercing parts ſo acceptable
to <hi>Mazarine,</hi> that he alone engroſs'd more of the
publick buſineſs, then all the Embaſſadors elſe that
were then in <hi>Paris.</hi> He maketh new Propoſitions
to the Cardinal, that the Forces of both Kingdoms
might be united againſt the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> the common
Enemy. <hi>Lionne,</hi> which <hi>Lomeny</hi> Earl of <hi>Bryenne,</hi>
his Majeſties Secretary, Treats with <hi>Lockhart</hi> about
the new Agreement; the Articles of the Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are interchangably ſubſcrib'd <hi>March</hi> 23. 1657.
The ſubſtance of them was this; <hi>Towards the force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Peace from the</hi> Spaniards <hi>that were averſe, that
the</hi> French <hi>and</hi> Engliſh <hi>forces be joyned together;
that Siege be laid to</hi> Gravelyn, Dunkirk, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike;
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:101520:185"/>
               <hi>and if they were taken,</hi> Gravelin <hi>to be held
by the</hi> French; Dunkirk, and Mardike <hi>by the</hi> Engliſh
<hi>preſerving entire the Profeſſion of the Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
This League to endure a full year, in which
time no Treaty of Peace to be made with the</hi> Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,
<hi>but by common conſent.</hi> But the Summer of
that year proving too ſhort, retarded the Deſign
only <hi>Mardike,</hi> being then taken; ſaving that the
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> alarm'd at ſo ſtrong a Combination, to
ſuſpect their own ſtrength, took ſpecial care to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the places on that Sea-coaſt.</p>
            <p>Then dyed <hi>Belleure</hi> prime Preſident of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Paris,</hi> of great Authority in the gowned
Aſſembly, but growing more and more daily out of
favour at Court. He took much upon him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
to wear about him a Train and many Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quays,
kept Horſes and Hounds for credit and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
having Furniture about him exceeding all
bounds. His Anceſtors Seat that had been defaced
with duſt, was gilt over by him: yet theſe Braveries
could not prevent the Owner from being ſcorched
up with a Feaver. <hi>Lamogny</hi> ſucceeded him, being
in high reputation for having well diſcharged the
Office of Maſter of Requeſts, and for integrity of
converſation. A perſon to that degree commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
as honeſty can be underſtood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſtina</hi> Queen of <hi>Swethland,,</hi> the Iſſue of the
Great <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> having relinquished her Kingdoms,
and confirmed at <hi>Rome</hi> the knowledge of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Religion, whoſe firſt foundations ſhe had
laid at <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> reſolved for the ſatisfaction of her
curioſity to travel, to ſurvey divers parts of <hi>Europe,</hi>
to inform her ſelf of their Cuſtoms and Policies.
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:101520:185"/>
Inveigled with the delights of <hi>France,</hi> returned
this year pretending to ſome News ſhe had to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
and as though ſhe were aſſured of the
State of <hi>Naples,</hi> propoſed the hopes of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to the Duke of <hi>Anjou. Mazarine</hi> entertained
her at the Court at <hi>Fountain-belleau,</hi> and though he
ſlighted the idle Report, that the Queen had
brought, yet held her in Treaty by Letters and
other Applications. In the mean time caſting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
her back the Reverence due to the Royal
Houſe, ſhe ordered one of her Retinue to be piſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
under pretence of his being a Traitor and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealer
of his Ladies Secrets, though he in vain
pleaded for the protection of that priviledged place.
It was debated whether ſhe ſhould be turned forth
without coming into his Majeſties Preſence, or
whether the Fact ſhould be queſtioned. It ſeemed
more adviſeable to wave the ſeeking reparations:
Therefore his Majeſty viſits her without making
any mention of the perſon ſlain, and ſhe having tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied
a few days, was honourably diſmiſſed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The year following 1658. in the beginning of
the Spring was the League renewed with the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
Abel Servient</hi> Lord Treaſurer, and the Count
of <hi>Bryenne</hi> concluding with <hi>Lockhart.</hi> The Siege
of <hi>Dunkird</hi> was reſolved at <hi>Amiens;</hi> and for a
blind of it; the King gave abroad that he had taken
up an intention to reduce <hi>Hedin.</hi> After the death
of <hi>Bellebran</hi> the Governor <hi>Riviere</hi> and <hi>Forgan,</hi> who
were Officers is the Garriſon, having ſhaken off the
yoke, did alike diſown both the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi>
Command. The Court had drawn down thither
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:101520:186"/>
to repreſs the Mutineers, but they being neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred
with the brightneſs of Majeſty, nor with a
moſt powerful Army, diſcharged their Guns, and by
all ſort of Hoſtility filled up the full meaſure of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.
From thence the King marches ſtraight
for <hi>Calais.</hi> Whither he was ſcarcely arrived, but
that he is certified of the inveſting <hi>Dunkirk</hi> by <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne,</hi>
accompanied with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Arms, under
the Conduct of <hi>Lockhart,</hi> to the admiration of all
the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> that in the want of Forrage,
Wood, Turfe, Wheat, their courage did not fail.
Herein, as in other occaſions, the Providence of
<hi>Mazarine</hi> was remarkable, who by continual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys
by Sea, maſtered the barrenneſs of the Soil, and
with induſtry ſupplied the defects of Nature. The
King and he viſited <hi>Mardike</hi> to give the nearer
countenance to the Expedition. But it was judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſafer, for his Majeſty to ſtay at <hi>Calais,</hi> whilſt the
Event of the Enterprise was yet in doubt, as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
it was. <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſent his Son-in-Law <hi>Falcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>
Embaſſadour Extraordinary to kiſs the
Kings Hand at <hi>Calais,</hi> and acquaint him, <hi>That he
was grieved, that by reaſon of hit age, and the weight
of his Affairs, he could not come in perſon to wait upon
his Majeſty, and give himſelf the ſatisfaction of ſeeing
him. The taking of</hi> Dunkirk <hi>he indeed wiſhed more
to advance by it the Kings Glory, than for any profit or
reputation to the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Falconbridge</hi> is honourably received by the King,
and having been preſented ſumptuouſly and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificently
returned home. In the mean time <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi>
aſſaulted <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Leyds</hi>
more ſtoutly defending. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:101520:186"/>
bent and reſtrained their whole Power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the diſtreſſed City. <hi>Dou Juan d'Auſtria</hi> and
<hi>Conde</hi> drew up not far off, and ſent in <hi>Hoquincourt,</hi>
who as he views the <hi>French</hi> Camp, was ſhot through
by a common Souldier; happy in his misfortune,
becauſe by looking out his Fate he anticipated the
deſtruction that was imminent over the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurenne, June</hi> 14. 1658. about nine in the
morning, having left the care of the Trench to
<hi>Richlieu,</hi> went to ſeek the approaching <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
and met with him, which gave the Enemy terrour.
The Marqueſs of <hi>Crequi</hi> commanded the right
wing, and he was matched with <hi>Conde,</hi> who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
not to be conquered. <hi>Chaſte aunaud Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſſier</hi>
led the left Squadron, where ſtood <hi>Lockhart</hi>
with his <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Scarce was ever a more bloody
Fight in ſo ſhort a time. Whatſoever old Souldiers
were in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Forces fell before the face of
<hi>Don Juan,</hi> who being himſelf obliged to retreat, is
reported to have cryed out, <hi>That he was conquered
by ſavage Beaſts that ruſhed on furiouſly without any
ſenſe of danger.</hi> Few of the <hi>French</hi> were loſt. <hi>Conde</hi>
having his Horſe killed under him, eſcaped hardly,
mounted on anothers. His moſt intimate friends
were taken, <hi>Guitault, Mely, Boutteville, Collins,</hi> and
others. The Baggage and Colours left upon the
place fell to the Victor. <hi>Thurennes</hi> valour was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled
even by the Enemy, who in ſo great a Battel
acted more than commanded. And what leſs could
be expected of ſuch a Captain, to whom no face of
War is new and ſtrange, who hath imbibed all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Diſcipline, and perfected it by long practice,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:101520:187"/>
having been ſo often exerciſed by Fortune, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
out-done others and himſelf? No farther
hope of Relief being left the beſieged, <hi>Leyda</hi> held
out <hi>Dunkirk</hi> to the laſt undaunted; and at laſt
cruſhed under ſo many cares and hazardous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
dyed of a ſhot; fortunate in this, that he
did not ſurvive the deſtruction of the City, but had
its monumental Walls the Witneſſes of his Valour.
The beſieged City followed his Fate, which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred
to the <hi>French</hi> King. He on the 25. of <hi>June</hi>
entred it, thinking himſelf abundantly ſatisfied in
ſecuring the old Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lockhart</hi> in the Name of <hi>Cromwell</hi> engaged by
ſolemn Oath, that the <hi>Catholick</hi> Profeſſion ſhould
be preſerved entire at <hi>Dunkirk.</hi> The neighbouring
Cities <hi>Bergen, Dixmuid,</hi> and <hi>Feurne</hi> readily render
to the King. <hi>Crequi</hi> is ſent in a pompous Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſade
to <hi>Cromwell</hi> with <hi>Mazarines</hi> Nephew in his
Train. This was the laſt Blaze of that petty Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
who dyed not long after, in his Bed, a rare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
The whole World run a madding after
the Fanatick, to whoſe induſtry was attributed
what ſhould be imputed to the Viciſſitude of Times.
The dulneſs of his ſtupid Age acquired him Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
Such Monſters do ariſe when unavoidable
Alterations are imminent; which muſt be without
delay taken off, or the proper time attended: yet
for all this paſſions of cruelty are not to be provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
nor mens ſpirits inflamed to Revenge. They
oftentimes fall into no great inconveniencies who
take wrongs patiently.</p>
            <p>Amidſt theſe proſperous ſucceſſes, the King falls
into a Feaver at <hi>Calais,</hi> judged mortal. His Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:101520:187"/>
groaned over the Fate of her Son, <hi>France</hi> of her
King, <hi>Mazarine</hi> of his Maſter. Supplications are
made at all Altars, and Prayers for his Majeſties
Recovery publickly enjoyned. <hi>Mazarine</hi> day and
night ſate by his Bed-ſide, to make him govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in taking Phyſick, which he would taſte him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
either to take off the unpleaſantneſs, or make
proof of it. The eleventh day accounted Critical,
the King ſeemed at the point of death; could
ſcarcely lift up his eyes, that now appeared almoſt
ſet in his head. The agony of the diſeaſe a little
remitting, he came to know them that ſtood by
him; his Majeſty never being totally eclipſed.
Oftentimes turning to <hi>Mazarine,</hi> whom he (obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gingly
called by the name of Friend) would ask
him, to adviſe him freely of the extreme danger of
his life, ſince his Mother out of tenderneſs of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
could not. <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> the Kings
Brother, to whom upon the death of <hi>Lewis</hi> the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
had devolved, demeaned himſelf modeſtly.
<hi>Pleſſe Praſlin</hi> was his Governor. Although there
wanted not among the Courtiers Spirits deſirous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Alteration, that before the ſetting of the Sun
adored the riſing one. The King having Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
with judgment adminiſtred him by <hi>Geunault,</hi>
recovered, and being conveyed to <hi>Paris,</hi> payed his
Vows in <hi>Noſtre-dame</hi>-Church; a Heart of maſſie
Gold was hung upon the Wall as an Oblation. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
to confirm his Health, he retired to <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainbelleau.
Mazarine</hi> ſtayed ſome time behind to
advance the Siege of <hi>Graveling. Mareſchal Ferte</hi>

               <hi>Graveling</hi> was the laſt Monument of the <hi>French</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> III. was dead, and before his Father,
<hi>Ferdinand</hi> the King of the <hi>Romans.</hi> The Imperial
Throne was vacant; for <hi>Leopoldus</hi> being in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority,
was not yet of an Age capable to manage
the Empire. Thus was there a wide field ſet open
for the Ambition of the Princes. This ſeemed a
fit opportunity to rend the Imperial Dignity from
the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> It is a hard matter to throw
down from its ancient Seat, a reigning Family that
is confirmed by the uninterrupted ſucceſſion of ſo
many years. <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> King of <hi>Swethland</hi>
having a juſt quarrel againſt the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
laid aſide all thought concerning himſelf, but

others. There occurred worthy of the Empire in

An honourable Embaſſie is ordered by the <hi>French</hi>

ſhould aſſume Spirits worthy of their Predeceſſors, and
not ſuffer the Empire gotten by their joynt valour to be

no benefit hoped of the Peace of <hi>Munſter,</hi> as long as the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> are predominant in the Emperours Council.
That the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> ſtrength having been impaired by ſo

take, leſt by their acquiring the Imperial Name, their
power might turn to the prejudice of <hi>Germany.</hi> Nor

<hi>Auſtrian</hi> Souldiers being diſperſed into remote places,
cannot ſo eaſily come into a Body, and give the Electors
Law.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> having praiſed the Kings
intention, profeſſed that he had the like inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but that it was a matter rather of wiſhes than

<hi>France, Padre Domingo,</hi> a Dominican Frier, her

in his inſtruction amongſt the Articles of
making a League, that <hi>the Daughter of</hi> Portugal
<hi>might marry with his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty. Domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi>
is honourably entertained, but it was judged
proper to ſend an Embaſſadour to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> that ſo
great tranſactions might not ſeem to depend upon
the ſingle faith of a Monk. <hi>Cominges</hi> is choſen
upon divers accounts qualified for the Treaty.

Eminent in birth, induſtrious, politick, bearing a
faith to the Queen, unſhaken even in the moſt
doubtful times, which are wont to diſcover
falſe hearts, or to alter unconſtant ones. Such
a man did the weight of the affair require. For
when as the Queen was averſe to a match with
the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> it was not to be truſted but to a
faithful Perſon, as was <hi>Cominges</hi> beyond others.
<hi>Mazarine</hi> deſigning in his mind a Peace, inclined

the Queens favour, forwarding the womans
Ambition, and prompting to all that which might
lead the high-ſpirited Lady to Glory, by the obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
example of our Queen, who had chaſed away
the deadly ſtorms with her ſole prudence, and
having ſubdued her Rebels, enjoyed her Kingdom
in peace. Her Majeſty of <hi>Portugal</hi> yielded a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
ear to him diſcourſing on a pleaſing ſubject,
and anſwered modeſtly, nor according to the pride
inherent in that Nation. <hi>To follow ſuch an example,
was indeed reſolved by her, but to reach it would be
difficult,</hi> and turning her eyes to both her Children
which ſtood by her, and never ſtirred from thence.
<hi>This,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>is the bound of my Labours, and I
deſire to live ſo long till I can prefer them.</hi> France
<hi>will abundantly oblige me, if it look, favourably on
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:101520:190"/>
them.</hi> In modeſt terms ſhe intimated the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of her Daughter. The People tranſported with
greedy hopes, and anticipated joys, ſnatcht up
uncertainties of expreſſion for conceſſions: in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
acclamations congratulating them as Husband

            <p>The Common-people of <hi>Lisbonne</hi> breathing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
only Liberty comes to the Embaſſadours houſe,
which is a ſtrange act. And being troubled at the
dubious proceeding, begs and beſeeches him to
open the cauſes of it, crying out againſt the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of Miniſters, and threatning to be aveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of them. <hi>Cominges</hi> diſcreetly minded the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of their duty, compoſing the waves of Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with a proper Oration: when they enquired
more particularly into the ſecrets of the Marriage,
he fairly diſmiſſed them as being too bold, yet not
without a donative. About this time <hi>Cominges</hi>
frankly ſpoke his mind to her Majeſty of <hi>Portugal,</hi>
and ſhewed her in what danger ſhe was, her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
diſagreeing, her Officers unable to command,
her People divided; that it was his Maſters mind
to aſſiſt the <hi>Portuguez</hi> in all Conditions, and not to
ſtart from the Articles of the Agreement already
begun: but that it were more adviſeable to finiſh
it wholly by an Embaſſadour at <hi>Paris.</hi> Thus <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minges</hi>
acquainted with the Treaty of <hi>Pementelli,</hi>
preſerving entire the dignity of an Embaſſadour,
withdrew himſelf from the indignation of the

out inſtead of words, tears, and broken mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings

Cologne and Munſter, at length in the

The death of Mazarine glorious in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
The King aſſiſted by a famous Miniſtry of
State takes the Reins of Government into his own
hands, which he manages with wonderful happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
being awful at home, as a Father, formidable
abroad, as a Conquerour.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IN the laſt part of my work I may take the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to uſe that Preface, which moſt have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in the beginning of their whole Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that Iam about to write the moſt memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
affair that hath occurred in this age, which is
the difficult work of concluding the Peace, which
notwithſtanding the oppoſite reaſons of Princes,
after ſo many ineffectual attempts, amidſt Intereſts
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:101520:192"/>
labouring to the contrary, <hi>Mazarine</hi> happily tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted.</p>
            <p>Here, firſt of all, it is ſufficiently manifeſt that
ſince the friendſhip accorded between <hi>Henry</hi> and
<hi>Philip</hi> in the agreement made at <hi>Vervin,</hi> betwixt
the care of determining that War, and commencing
a new one, there had fallen out divers provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which might have reſcinded the Articles, and
by the heats of both Nations paſs on to open blows,
the Peace never ſtanding unmoved, but ſhaken with
leſſer contraventions.</p>
            <p>After the death of <hi>Henry</hi> taken off in the very
preparations of a new War, during the unactive
times of <hi>d' Ancres</hi> and <hi>Luines,</hi> we fell upon <hi>Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu,</hi>
who having happily compoſed the affairs at
home, firſt introduced among the <hi>French,</hi> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of a ſtrict Authority. He was reſolved to
have War, for ſo he might the more ſecurely, at
the expenſe of foreign blood, maintain his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
His Principal aim was to reduce all to the
ſtandard of an abſolute Monarchy, to ſhake off
that long continued Yoke, whereby the liberty of
the Crown is circumſcribed by Acts of Parliament,
and the Peoples good. So to guild over with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,
practiſes ungracious to the publick, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

            <p>It is not my buſineſs here to recount the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
receiv'd or done, the Battels and Slaughters
wherewith the ſtrong Forces of either Nation did
mutually deſtroy one another. On the contrary,
I think this to be worth my pains, to turn my ſelf

doth with the Common-wealth of <hi>Venice,</hi>
ſtrive to quench this vaſt Conflagration of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
A meeting is appointed at <hi>Cologne,</hi> lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Rhyne,</hi> whether at the beginning of the year
1637. the Commiſſioners of the Emperour and
King of <hi>Spain</hi> came.</p>
            <p>Here begins the Treaty of Peace, which I have
reſerv'd intire for this Book, leſt being ſcatter'd by
pieces through the whole Work, it might check the
Readers Career. The <hi>Swedes</hi> rejected the K. of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
nominated for a Mediator of the Peace,
as being their old Rival. Therefore the <hi>French,</hi>
as Partiſans with the <hi>Swede,</hi> were not admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Treaty at <hi>Cologne,</hi> amidſt divers preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
eight years paſt; In the mean time <hi>Richelieu</hi>
dies, into whoſe place <hi>Julius Cardinal Mazarine</hi>
being ſubſtituted, would have compleated the
Work, had not the untimely death of <hi>Lewis</hi> put a
ſtop to thoſe fair beginnings.</p>
            <p>At length when they had got over the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Preliminary Articles (that term was then
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:101520:193"/>
invented, to denote the firſt preparatories) becauſe
<hi>Cologne</hi> diſlik'd the <hi>French,</hi> and the Interpoſition of
the Cardinals <hi>Ginetti,</hi> &amp; <hi>Roſſetti. Munſter,</hi> which is a
City of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> is choſen by the conſent of all, as
the place of Treaty, being judg'd convenient, ſince
upon the removal of the Imperial garriſon, it having
continu'd a Free State, could give ſuſpicion to none.
<hi>Fabio Chighi</hi> a <hi>Seneſe,</hi> the Popes <hi>Nuncio</hi> at <hi>Cologne,</hi>
and <hi>Aloyſio Contareni,</hi> a Senator of <hi>Venice,</hi> both of
them men of great Experience, are by general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
admitted Mediators. The Emperours Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
were <hi>Lodowick,</hi> Count of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> and
<hi>Iſaac Volmar</hi> Doctor of Law. Afterwards Count
<hi>Tranſmendorff</hi> was ſuper-added, a Perſon of the
moſt extraordinary Abilities in <hi>Caeſars</hi> Commiſſion.
<hi>Claude memmius Avoſſie,</hi> and <hi>Abel Servient</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
in behalf of the King of <hi>France.</hi> From the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> Count <hi>Linneranda,</hi> with whom was
joyn'd <hi>Anthony Brown, a Sequanis,</hi> who with his
two Pages in a ſlaſh'd Suit, and with a tatter'd
Coach, was of more importance to the Work, then
half the Meeting beſides. For the <hi>Swede</hi> came
brave men, <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Oxenſtierne,</hi> and <hi>John Sauge
Oſnabrugge</hi> was choſen the Seat for the Proteſtants,
that they might not mingle with the Catholicks.
From the States of <hi>Holland, Pauw</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi>
and <hi>Knute</hi> the <hi>Zelander</hi> were of eminency beyond
the other Commiſſioners of the Provinces. <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guevil</hi>
of the Blood Royal, Principal of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
being added to <hi>Avoſſie</hi> and <hi>Servient,</hi> entring
<hi>Munſter</hi> with a train like an Emperour, made the
Aſſembly and City gaze upon him. <hi>Pinneranda</hi> a
few days after enter'd by night, either to conceal
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:101520:193"/>
his meaner attendance, or that out of a piece of
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> State he would be tarried for.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the Prime men who graced the
Meeting at <hi>Munſter;</hi> the reſt were but as Acceſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
ſent by their reſpective Soveraigns; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
daily there aroſe ſeveral diſputes about Place:
The moſt remarkable was between the <hi>Venetians</hi>
and the ſeven <hi>Electors;</hi> thoſe pleading the preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of having been ſo many Ages Free-States, do
ſcarcely acknowledge God their Soveraign; Theſe
indeed, the Emperours Creators, do preſently
worſhip their Creature. The <hi>Venetians</hi> carried the
precedency, as in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and every
where elſe. There was a mighty diſpute of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a Commiſſioner from <hi>Portugal,</hi> which the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
in vain oppos'd; the <hi>French</hi> ſtoutly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
him. It is ſtrange in what credit the <hi>French</hi>
were, by reaſon of their proſperous ſucceſſes. In
all this time differences grew high upon ſpecious
pretences, which gave fuel to great animoſities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fabio Chigi,</hi> one of a mild temper, did diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
remove all ſuch things as he judg'd might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
or retard the buſineſs of Peace; watchful on
all particulars, diſguſted by none; with his Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and gentle Carriage, did oblige the reſpects of
the Grandees. <hi>Contareni</hi> a man of able parts, but
paſſionate, proceeded ſometimes with more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
then warineſs.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of the Conference was a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiem</hi>
for the deceas'd Pope <hi>Vrbane;</hi> news being
brought of the Election of Innocent, <hi>Te Deum</hi> was
Sung; And when the Aſſembly was fully met, the
beginning was made at good Prayers, that <hi>God
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:101520:194"/>
would proſper their pious Endeavours for putting an
end to the War,</hi> and a ſolemn proceſſion perform'd
for bleſſing the City; ſo that all things were done
which are reputed effectual for attoning God.
Never was it prov'd by more evident Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that God who is the Author of Peace, though
call'd upon after the due Order, did not preſide in
that Meeting; for what was there practic'd in it
but Jugling and Sophiſtry? How much money?
How much time was idly thrown away? How
many Letters writ in Cyphers? How many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cypher'd?
What inſiſting upon Punctilioes? So
that the Meeting might ſeem not to have been held
about the Peace of Chriſtendom, but about the
Place of Princes: Never did Aſſembly more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
play the mad Men, nor upon ſo ſerious an
occaſion, were more egregious Children. All the
time of the Aſſembly, nothing was more abſurd,
then the quarrels between <hi>Avozzi</hi> and <hi>Servient,</hi>
who not remitting their differences for the Majeſty
of their Countrey, nor out of reſpect to their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
nor the good of the Kingdom, through
frequent contradictions of the Council, though well
advis'd, did by their private peeviſhneſs deſtroy
whatever Authority they had; Whereas it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
all that conſult about matters of moment,
to be unprejudic'd with any affection, which
does ill qualifie to all Adminiſtrations. How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent
is it for men joyn'd in the higheſt Power for
the Publick, to be divided in private Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities?</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, this is to be laid down for a
certain truth, that the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> while the new
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:101520:194"/>
King of <hi>Portugal</hi> claim'd his Right; while the
Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> waver'd; while <hi>Catalaunia</hi>
ſtood out in perfect Rebellion; while their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury
was not ſufficient to defray the War, and their
Affairs in all parts diſtreſs'd, did wholly deſpair of
obtaining honourable conditions of Peace, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the <hi>French,</hi> being puff'd up with ſo many Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes;
therefore they thought they muſt flye to
Policies, which is a part of wiſdom. Prevailing
upon the opportunities in <hi>France,</hi> where the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority
of Kings is always accompanied with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
calamities; they feed unquiet ſpirits with hope
of Alterations, which that Nation abundantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces;
but their principal care is to ſeparate their
Confederates and Allies. The <hi>Swedes,</hi> they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taque
by the Emperour, who makes them large
proffers, ſo they would but quit the <hi>French</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.
The <hi>Hollanders,</hi> they practiſe colourably
with an offer of undoubted Liberty, freedom of
Navigation, and a quiet poſſeſſion of all that they
had already acquir'd. The <hi>Swedes</hi> held firmly
to their Principle, and the Emperours Arts could
make no impreſſion upon a Nation, always ſtuck
to their Honour and Word. The caſe of <hi>Holland</hi>
was greatly debated, not only in the Provinces, but
in <hi>Holland</hi> it ſelf; ſeveral Cities ſtood ſeverally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
nor within the Cities were all of one judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but every one led by the impulſe of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Intereſt, the moſt cogent Argument.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Commiſſioners, before they came to
<hi>Munſter,</hi> ſtay'd ſome time at the <hi>Hague,</hi> to pry into
whatever weak ſide, or unſound part ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
eſpecially the mind of <hi>Orange,</hi> whoſe Wife
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:101520:195"/>
was tax'd to be engaged. The Prince now ſtricken
in years, and broken with Military Labours, having
but one Son, and he not yet compleat Man, thought
it ſafe, after ſo many gallant Services to ſound a
Retreat. Moſt of the more diſcreet diſcours'd
thus, that <hi>the Charge could no longer be ſupported;
nor could the War be carried on with any fair hope;
nothing came by it but Damages;</hi> that <hi>there was no
neceſſity of it, and it might be juſtly feared, leaſt the
Common-People ſhould take diſtaſte at their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
and deny the payment of Taxes. Therefore</hi>
that <hi>they should hearken to a Truce, or rather a
Peace; Provided that their Liberty might be not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
condition, or for a time, but abſolutely and for
ever preſerved entire.</hi> Others on the contrary, that
<hi>Peace was not deſired by the</hi> Spaniard, <hi>but the having
War at his own, rather then his Confederates moſt
convenient time; or what is worſe then War, the
vexing of their State by Diviſions, and corrupting
them; till the ſtrength of their old Souldiers be worn
off.</hi> At length they concluded, that <hi>at leaſt no
agreement ſhould be admitted without the privity,
and in a ſort the Warranty of the</hi> French.</p>
            <p>Theſe Diſcourſces paſſed at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and all
over the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> when the Mediators at
<hi>Munſter,</hi> by their Prudential Addreſſes, ſuſtained
hopes of the Peace; and the Commiſſioners of the
Kings to the fruſtrating one another, ſpun out time
in ſtarting new exceptions. All the Aſſembly no
longer able with any patience to put up ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
delays, reſolved by any means to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the Treaty. Seeing for ſo long time nothing
was got but words of an ambiguous importance,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:101520:195"/>
and ſuch as every party interpreted at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
according to the daily ſucceſs of Army.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> in their firſt Memorial, require be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any thing, that <hi>the Archbiſhop of</hi> Tryers, <hi>the

Avozzi <hi>as he paſſed by, according to his devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
had dropt ſome intimations of advice at the</hi>
Hague <hi>about tolerating the Catholick Profeſſion.</hi>
That they ſhould do this truly for their Kindreds ſake,
they ſhould do it for the memory of their Anceſtors,
not to hate the Religion which they had approved more
cruelly than the Tenents of the Anabaptiſts that are
new and deſtructive to Government, who are tolerated
among the <hi>Hollanders</hi> while the Catholicks are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.
<hi>This puzzled them that are for Liberty of
Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Servient <hi>was judged more fit for the Embaſſie,
and he diſcharged it worthily. At the</hi> Hague <hi>he
made an eloquent Speech, as he had an excellent
Underſtanding and Utterance.</hi> At laſt, <hi>ſaith he,</hi>
the Arts that your Anceſtors feared are broke out. And
have you forgot the Courage of your Fathers, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided
the Embaſſies of Kings for Peace, not as the
Councils of Friends, but as the Plots of Enemies? If
there be no deceit in the bottom, why doth not <hi>Pinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa</hi>
deal above board? That which is honeſt and
fair needs no Arts to diſguiſe it. Softneſs in a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Nation is over-haſty. It is ſuſpicious to have Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
offered by a King not conquered, and to have it
ſecured by the Confeſſion of a Prince diſclaimed. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
ye do obtain it by force of Arms, yet the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> is the firſt way to ſlavery. That
<hi>Philip</hi> was never ſo ſelf-denying as to throw away his
juſt Government, but doth allow the <hi>Dutch</hi> the ſhort
reſpit of a temporary Liberty. That Kings gather
ſtrength by delay: When the hatred is worn away,
and paſt injuries forgot that people return to their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance.
In Peace the vices that accompany ſecurity
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:101520:196"/>
are to be feared. When your Arms are laid down,
you ſhall never be at Peace; you have no ground to fear
the ſad misfortunes of being ſurpriſed. So many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
Towns; ſo many Men of War; ſuch ſtrength of
Horſe and Foot trained for the Field. The Ocean
drawn about you, and the Valour of your moſt excellent
General (<hi>he pointed at</hi> Orange <hi>there preſent</hi>) will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
you, and what is more, the joynt Arms of my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who
ſtands not in ſuch need of you, as to aſſiſt thoſe
that ſlight his Counſel. This Advice comes to you
from a Friend, from your firſt Confederate, from a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
King, whoſe only Intereſt is your ſafety. I do
not engage you to eternize the War. I cry after Peace,
but ſuch a one whoſe Iſſue may be ſecure by the <hi>French</hi>
Warranty, and that there is need of joyning Councils
to that effect.</p>
            <p>It is ſtrange with what heats the Propoſition
was debated in all the States. Sometimes even
<hi>Mazarine</hi> was not ſpared, as though he had ſecret
hopes of future advantages by the miſeries of the
ſuited Allies. Some Emiſſaries came ſecretly from
<hi>Panneranda</hi> to the <hi>Hague</hi> to ſet out all Secrets, which
was not unknown to <hi>Servient. Wherefore,</hi> ſaith
he, <hi>do there come Spies but to ſearch if there be any
evenue open for deceit and money to enter in at?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Servient</hi> whether by his Eloquence, or his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
obtained this, that neither Party, without the
conſent of the other, ſhould capitulate with the
<hi>Spaniard</hi> the common Enemy. He returned to
<hi>Munſter,</hi> after he had brought the Provinces to be
of one mind, which was to his credit. <hi>Mazarine</hi>
always ſuſpected ſome falſe trick from the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
nor did the iſſue deceive him; the <hi>French</hi>
               <pb n="380" facs="tcp:101520:197"/>
grew more and more hateful, whoſe Arms prevailed
to the deſtruction of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Debates hung
undetermined at <hi>Munſter.</hi> All things proceeded
ſlowly. Before former Propoſitions were diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
new Pretenſions are ſet on foot, nor could dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
eaſily be ſolved: the Commiſſioners of the
leſſer Princes murmured, and did not conceal it,
that they would not be the Spectators of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
whoſe whole Scene was laid at <hi>Paris</hi> and
<hi>Madrid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> ordered their proceeding ſo dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly,
that none did otherwiſe but impute a Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Hoſtility to them, and a deſire of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the War to us; and as the beginning of the
Troubles was charged upon <hi>Richlieu,</hi> ſo the obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Peace was upon <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who loved to
tread ſafe, and conſequently ſlow. From the very
firſt he foreſaw that Peace could not be had from
the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> without extorting it by force of
Arms, and therefore he muſt propagate both inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine
and foreign Wars, that ſo <hi>France</hi> becoming
victorious in all Parts, might preſcribe Laws of
Peace.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Munſter</hi> after divers Propoſals without any
effect, at length this Project was broached as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive,
which by the Mediators was offered to our
Commiſſioners; <hi>That the King of</hi> Spain <hi>in favour
to the moſt deſired Peace, doth quit to the King of</hi>
France <hi>the County of</hi> Ruſſillon, <hi>the perpetual poſſeſſion
of the conquered Towns in</hi> Flanders <hi>and</hi> Franche
Comte, <hi>ſo that</hi> Portugal <hi>may be left to the</hi> Spaniſh
<hi>Vengeance. That the Duke of</hi> Lorraine <hi>be ſatisfied,
and what places in the Territories of the Dukes of</hi>
               <pb n="381" facs="tcp:101520:197"/>
Savoy <hi>and</hi> Mantua <hi>have been taken by both Kings,
may be reſpectively reſtored to their proper Lord. For

but with an intention of picking quarrels,
and only for a blind to deliver the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from
the <hi>Odium</hi> of the War, and to diſcharge it wholly
upon the <hi>French,</hi> by that means giving our Allies
and Confederates an occaſion to fall off from us.
Then there went abroad a Rumor, that the Peace
was concluded, not at <hi>Munſter</hi> only, but in the
Neighbourhood; and thence into remote parts.
The Mediators come with joy to <hi>Longuevilles</hi> houſe.
One might have ſeen their faces ſhine with a ſudden
lightſomneſs. <hi>Chighi</hi> in a manner proſtrating
himſelf before <hi>Longueville,</hi> begs and intreats him,
<hi>That now matters were in a poſture more promiſing
than could have been hoped for, he would content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and that he with his Fellow-Commiſſioners would
not inſiſt too ſtrictly upon Niceties;</hi> then ſhewing
him a Pen, <hi>Take that and ſign: This Pen will bring
you more Glory than that Sword of your great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
of</hi> Downs, <hi>wherewith he chaſed the</hi> Engliſh

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Penneranda</hi> indeed had in a Vapour offered theſe
ſpecious, but inſidious Propoſals. The <hi>French</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
that many things which they had already
agreed upon were omitted; as firſt of <hi>Braganza,</hi>
whether King or Uſurper of <hi>Portugal,</hi> that all men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhould be waved; <hi>Lorraine</hi> ſhould be reſtored,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:101520:198"/>
but not fully; he that had ſo often violated his
Covenant, ſhould for a penalty loſe ſome part of his
Dominion, at leaſt the towring Fortifications of
<hi>Nancey</hi> be diſmantled, that ſo being diſabled from
twice doing miſchief, he might for the future learn
to demean himſelf with more moderation; that
<hi>Duarte</hi> of <hi>Braganza</hi> ſhould be enlarged, which the
<hi>French</hi> maintained, had been already diſcuſſed, but
<hi>Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>neranda</hi> had omitted and formalized upon, as
though they were newly ſet on foot. Here the
proceeding ſtopped.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mazarine</hi> having commended the prudence of
the Commiſſioners, exhorted them to bend their
whole cares upon the <hi>Swede</hi> and <hi>Hollander,</hi> that it
was hot likely <hi>Penneranda</hi> would inſiſt ſo much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
formalities unleſs he were ſecure of them.</p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe things were under debate the year
1648. paſſed on, when in the mouth of <hi>September</hi>
the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors declared that they had it in
their laſt Inſtructions, that they ſhould no longer
dwell upon the matter, unleſs the Article about
<hi>Lorraine</hi> proceeded in form, as hath been above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.
The <hi>Hollanders</hi> impatient for Peace,
looking upon the <hi>French</hi> ſucceſſes with a jealous
eye, and thinking that the preſent opportunity was
to be laid hold upon without advice of the <hi>French,</hi>
without advice of the Mediators, conclude with
<hi>Penneranda;</hi> ſo it was believed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> not well digeſting that, ſent to the
<hi>Hague</hi> to complain of it. So far was this from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
any thing in favour of the <hi>French</hi> friendſhip,
as that the Truce was turned into a perpetual Peace,
reſerving their Commerce and the continuance of
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:101520:198"/>
what they were in poſſeſſion of. <hi>Pauw</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner
of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> ſupported the whole weight
of the Pacification againſt the other ſix Provinces.
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ute</hi> the <hi>Zelander</hi> contributed his diligent aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
to that alſo.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> having for ſo many years
been ſupported by the <hi>French</hi> Forces, Counſels, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
joyned in a league of Amity with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
their Enemies. So far have we been from ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any prejudice by it, that it hath rather turned
to our great Glory; Allies joyned without the
Arms of any, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having been brought
to terms of Peace; glorious for us without, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Thus the Commiſſioners having been baffled after
ſo many expedients, in vain attempted the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
moſt famous next after that of <hi>Trent,</hi> for ſuch a
reſort of Nations was diſſolved without any
effect.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Oſnaburgh,</hi> almoſt at the ſame time, was the
Agreement of the <hi>German</hi> Peace concluded, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the intervention of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> By that
Proviſion the <hi>Swedes</hi> honourably endeavouring to
gain the <hi>French</hi> aſſent to the Capitulations, the
Princes and Free-States of the Empire were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
ſatisfied in this, that they might freely
ſerve God according to their Conſcience; that is,
a toleration of performing Divine Service after
their own way. This ſo fretted <hi>Chighi</hi> the <hi>Nuncio,</hi>
that he tore the Papers about the Peace, and ſwore
he would hear no farther; the <hi>Swedes</hi> got the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Pomerania,</hi> with other adjoyning places. The
<hi>Savarian</hi> had his Territory enlarged, by an acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Upper <hi>Palatinate.</hi> To our ſhare fell
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:101520:199"/>
               <hi>Alſatia,</hi> with ſome Dependants, the payment of a
certain ſum of Money being aſſigned in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Damages, to repair the houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi>
An equal and fair regard was alſo had of the
<hi>Swedes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the end of the whole work are to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
the Articles of <hi>Munſter,</hi> agreed at <hi>Oſnabrug,</hi>
land at length eompleated and concluded in the Iſle
of <hi>Pheſants,</hi> at that abſolute Peace, which at this
day is in full force and power; and that it might
always ſo continue, I could wiſh.</p>
            <p>Thus ſhall I not be charged with negligence, if
I go off from theſe matters which loath me, and
would nauſeate others; in like manner as the
Wars of <hi>Piſa</hi> in <hi>Guicciardine,</hi> that have blemiſhed
that Work, otherwiſe excellent. Divers were the
Rumours over <hi>Europe,</hi> of the fruſtrating their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
expectation of Peace, ſome caſting the blame
upon the <hi>French,</hi> others upon the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
came out Libels, incentives of Diſcord; but
who were the occaſion that the buſineſs of the
Peace was not ſetled at <hi>Munſter,</hi> would require
more volumes then one to relate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am aſſured by the Letters of</hi> Longueville <hi>to
to</hi> Mazarine, <hi>that</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by their backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſtill aim'd at excepting againſt ſome particulars,
that ſo they might the more eaſily after their conclude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Peace with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> diſappoint the hopes
of the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when <hi>Mazarine</hi> fearing leſt the <hi>French</hi>
Miniſters being tyed up too cloſe to the Royal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
might not be able to reſolve <hi>extempore</hi>
difficulties that were moved, did by frequent Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:101520:199"/>
enquire of <hi>Longueville, whether any thing more
were to be remitted of the Kings right, that he might
have full Authority to tranſact,</hi> that <hi>Longueville</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
to it, that <hi>the</hi> Spaniards <hi>were averſe from all
accommodation, and only ſtrived to ſeperate from the</hi>
French <hi>their Allies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I can eaſily prove by the Originals that I
have ſeveral times read. Afterwards when <hi>France</hi>
was in flames with the Civil War, the King of
<hi>ſpain</hi> candidly diſcovered to an underſtanding
man the Embaſſadour, of a moſt powerful Prince,
that <hi>Penneranda would be induced by no Inſtructions
to hearken to Peace, and ſtill found out new pretences;
that he might not be forced to conclude it, but that
the event had proved it to have been wiſely done by
him, ſeeing that within four years the faireſt Cities
had been re-taken by the</hi> French <hi>diviſions, which
muſt have been quitted by the Agreement at</hi> Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mazarine,</hi> amidſt the Civil Diſſentions, left no
means unaſſayed to revive the Treaty of Peace.
<hi>Contareni</hi> at his intreaty attended upon fetching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the buſineſs, and came to the particular of
chuſing a fit place, fit for the Meeting upon the
Frontiers of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders. Penneranda</hi>
ſlighted all ſuch motions, being not backward to
make his advantages of the diſturbances in <hi>France.</hi>
For, ſaid he, <hi>If when the</hi> French <hi>proſpered in the firſt
times of their Kings Minority, my Maſter was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
from Peace; wherefore in the height of their
Civil War ſhould he receive dishonourable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>At length</hi> Vautorce <hi>is ſent to</hi> Bruſſels; Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neranda
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:101520:200"/>
               <hi>unboſometh himſelf to him;</hi> He could
never find in his heart to ſubſcribe thoſe celebrated,
conditions at <hi>Munſter,</hi> although he ſeemed to give his
aſsent to them; they were ſo unreaſonable, that no
true <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who had any love for his Country,
but would ſcorn them; And if the ſottiſhneſs of thoſe
that live at this day, had proceeded ſo far, as to
have accepted that Agreement, there would have
riſen out of their Bones, ſuch as ſhould diſanul the
<hi>Munſter</hi>-League.</p>
            <p>The laſt Eſſay was by <hi>Lyonne,</hi> who being at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray,</hi>
uſed all poſſible means to induce <hi>Penneranda</hi>
to a Treaty; but the endeavours or <hi>Lyonne</hi> proved
ineffectual, <hi>Penneranda</hi> ſtanding unmovable to the
point of reclaiming all that had been taken from
them, who went afterwards into <hi>Spain,</hi> and gave
an account of his Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter the Counſel of <hi>Spain</hi>
was divided; <hi>Penneranda,</hi> whether he thought ſo,
or to maintain the credit of this performance of
that Truſt, in the preſence of the King, before that
Honourable Board affirms; that <hi>Mazarine neither
was willing to have Peace, nor was there reaſon he
ſhould be willing.</hi> Divers Arguments he brought
to confirm his Poſition. <hi>Fuenſaldagne,</hi> even in
his abſence aſſerted the contrary by Letter, that <hi>it
was</hi> Mazarines <hi>intereſt to have Peace. Don Lewis
de Haro</hi> was at uncertainty which to believe; ſo
did the two oppoſite Judgments leave the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> diſſatisfied.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> dyes, <hi>Cardinal
Fabio Chighi,</hi> ſo often mentioned by us, is elected
his Succeſſor; he took the name of <hi>Alexander</hi> VII.
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:101520:200"/>
and this was done not by a nice ſcanning of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Circumſtances, but run off in a heat. At the
Conſecration of the new Pope, the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> World
rejoyced, for having ſuch a perſon given them in
theſe Storms and Troubles; nor was it without
cauſe, for the high reputation of <hi>Chighi</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſo far advanced, that the Votes of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave,
indeed, conferred upon him this pitch of
Honour; but the wiſhes of all men deſigned it.
A rare felicity to poſſeſs dignity by the general
Judgment, before one is diſtinguiſhed by the Mitre;
and to be reputed Biſhop, not yet to be. <hi>Mazarine</hi>
believed there was certain expectation of Peace
from him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyonne</hi> was preſent at the declaring <hi>Alexander</hi>
Pope: to whom immediately minding him of the
Peace, the new Pope offered it might be tranſact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Rome</hi> more conveniently than any where elſe
in the World: he anſwered, that appreared im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper,
both becauſe of the Territories which the
<hi>Spaniard</hi> poſſeſſeth in <hi>Italy;</hi> and alſo for the
Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> confining upon <hi>Rome:</hi> but
that ſome place would be found upon the Borders
of <hi>Genona,</hi> whither the Prime Miniſters of both
Kings might come with full power of concluding
the Peace, ſo that his Holineſs would be preſent to
mediate in it. All ways having been vainly tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to bring the matter already begun to an iſſue.
<hi>Mazarine</hi> reſolved to try the minds of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
by a new and unheard of method, which now
<hi>France</hi> was in a moſt flouriſhing eſtate, could not
be imputed to Cowardiſe: the ſending of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour,
I mean, to the Enemies, to invite them
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:101520:201"/>
not only to honourable, but alſo profitable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Peace. Such an occaſion offered it ſelf to
put in execution the deſign which the Cardinal had
purpoſed in his thought.</p>
            <p>In the year 1656. <hi>Gaſpar Boniface</hi> paſſing from
the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> into <hi>Spain</hi> through <hi>France,</hi> as
he kneeled to kiſs the Queens hand before he part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he freely declared to her Majeſty, how paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was deſirous of Peace,
and did not conceal what ſerious thoughts he had
of concluding it upon equal conditions, ſo that
ſome truſty perſon might be ſent to <hi>Madrid</hi> with
full power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mazarine</hi> was not long in debate with himſelf
to whoſe fidelity he ſhould commit the Truſt. For
any one, beſides <hi>Lyonne,</hi> to be admitted into a ſecret
of the higheſt importance, was thought unſafe.
Therefore having occaſion to imploy him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
him from <hi>Rome,</hi> a perſon there, whom there
was none fitter. <hi>Lyonne</hi> is of an Ancient Family in
<hi>Dauphinois;</hi> by being from his firſt youth trained
up at Court, an intimate Confident of <hi>Mazarines,</hi>
and imployed in divers Embaſſies; he is grown
perfect in the Government; of a reſerved temper,
cloſe in keeping ſecrets; commanding reſpect,
rather by ſparingneſs of Language, then multitudes
of Complements. Apt to aſſume nothing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
though by his happy Succeſſes he have acquired
praiſe and glory. No Soul more abhorring Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs
and Cruelty: Being qualified with theſe
endowments, he is employed in ſo great a buſineſs,
not only of running over the firſt draught of a
project of Peace, remitting the concluſion till ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:101520:201"/>
time; but if upon any reaſonable terms the
War might be compoſed, within eight days finally
to determine and to publiſh the Agreement. No
ſingle Perſon had ſo honourable a power granted
him, which his Majeſty wrote all over with his
own hand, and ſigned it, his four Secretaries of
his Cabinet not being made acquainted. The
words of the Inſtrument I thought fit to be inſerted
here, as being the <hi>Baſis</hi> on which the Peace that was
ſo long in Agitation without effect, is planted.</p>
            <p>I give this <hi>Lyonne,</hi> one of my Privy-Counſellours,
power to make, conclude, and ſign Articles of Peace
between me, and the Catholick King, my Brother and
Vncle; And by vertue of this Commiſſion, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
things the above-ſaid <hi>Lyonne</hi> ſhall grant in my
name, I engage, and in the word of a King, promiſe
that I will allow, ratifie, and obſerve. Dated at
<hi>Compeigne,</hi> Jun. 1. 1656. <hi>Which Instrument,
when the King had written in</hi> Mazarines <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and ſigned, he delivered, it</hi> Lyonne, <hi>in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of a Grandee of</hi> Spain, <hi>whom he ſpoke to in
theſe words of great weight and moment.</hi> Certifie
the King your Maſter, that this <hi>Lyonne</hi> whom you
ſee here, is choſen by me, my Plenipotentiary to adjuſt
a Peace; and that nothing is more deſirable to me,
then that it he moſt ſpeedily concluded, that I
may give proofs of my Reſpects to the King my
Vncle.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſhedding plenty of Tears, fell
down at his Majeſties feet, and anſwered, he would
immediately obey the commands of ſo great a King.
<hi>Lyonne</hi> had not to ſeek for ſome occaſion of going
abroad to be given out; he entred upon the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:101520:202" rendition="simple:additions"/>
guarded by his own worth and the ſtrength of
the Kingdom; having changed his cloaths, leſt he
ſhould be known by his own, going upon a ſecret
occaſion; and was diſguiſed in a Perruque, and
the habit of a Merchant. In ſuch a Garb, <hi>incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito,</hi>
he preſented himſelf on the 20 of <hi>June,</hi> the
day appointed, at the roots of the <hi>Syrenean,</hi> in the
border of both Kingdoms, every where with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
ſilecnce, as is his wont, he acted his part;
joyning in company with a <hi>Spaniſh Cavalliero</hi> that
ſtayed for him; he came ſafe to <hi>Madrid.</hi> None
enquired after the occaſion of his coming, nor was
his Face ſo much as looked upon by any to obſerve
it. Coaches are ſent to meet him, and he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
ſecretly into the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> where he kept
cloſe three months with <hi>Don Lewis de Haro,</hi> to
whom the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had given a like Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.
He happily comes to a determination up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the points in Controverſie, and had well-nigh
been famed for the concluding of the Peace, before
any one had heard that it was in agitation; all
things were carried with ſuch Prudence and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
What were the principal Articles of the
Agreement, I have not thought fit to ſpecifie here,
intending to put the entire Treaty at the end of
the Work, as hath been above-mentioned.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Conde</hi>'s buſineſs, the diligence of <hi>Lyonne</hi>
was <hi>non-plus'd.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were not content,
that <hi>ſo great an Exile ſhould obtain pardon of what
was paſt, recover his Eſtate, enjoy that, and the Kings
Favour;</hi> All which <hi>Lyonne</hi> promiſed; but they
further preſs, that <hi>he may be reſtored to his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Ancient Charges;</hi> as though he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:101520:202"/>
upon even terms, and inſiſt upon it ſo ſtiffly,
that they would prefer eternal War before Peace,
ſo as to ſuffer themſelves to be removed from that
Propoſal, becauſe it ſeems they would have this
Maxime imprinted in the hearts of the <hi>French. In
whatſoever condition the State of the</hi> Spaniards <hi>is,
they never come to ſuffer any prejudice who eſpouſe
their Intereſt. Lyonne</hi> was troubled that this Prize
ſhould be torn out of his hand; not unlike a tender
Mother, who ſeeing her grown Babe killed by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
or overlaid, mourns, and cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.</p>
            <p>A few days before he took his leave of <hi>Haro,</hi> he
urges twenty times that he would but ſuffer theſe
three words; <hi>Beſides his Charges and Governments</hi>
to be inſerted into the Articles already agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and immediately there would be an end of ſo
many miſeries, and the Sun-ſhine of Peace would
break forth and ſhine every where. <hi>Haro</hi> denies
that this can be obtained of his Maſter, and after
that <hi>Lyonne</hi> was diſmiſſed, ſo great Secrets having
been a long time ſuppreſt among us, the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
diſguiſing the truth, gave abroad that <hi>Mazarine,</hi>
both at <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Madrid,</hi> always deluded the
<hi>French</hi> Miniſters, and that he reſerved himſelf the
glory of the Peace, is not to be queſtioned. He
who thinks otherwiſe is ignorant both of <hi>Mazarine</hi>
and the <hi>French</hi> State, and through envy ſuppreſſeth
truth.</p>
            <p>The Electors of <hi>Mentz</hi> and <hi>Cologne,</hi> having met
at <hi>Franckfurt</hi> to treat about the Election of the
Emperour, took hold upon that occaſion, and exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Ambaſſadors of both Kings to revive the
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:101520:203"/>
Treaty of Peace ſo far advanced. <hi>Penneranda</hi> ſpum
out ten months in expecting his Maſters Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
this ſpace being expired, he deluded the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
of the Electors by repeating the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſo often rejected, and threatning; <hi>If any Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
were ſent from the Electors to his Maſter,
he would do his endeavour to have them turned out of</hi>
Madrid <hi>with diſgrace, and not ſo much as a Bark be
allowed them to lodge in. That in the firſt place
without any Controverſie, what the</hi> French <hi>held by
Conqueſt they ſhould reſtore; they muſt quit all</hi> Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine,
<hi>muſt abandon</hi> Braganza, <hi>muſt reſtore</hi> Conde <hi>to
his former Dignities, till he was aſcertained that the</hi>
French <hi>had conſented to theſe Conditions, he would not
ſo muſt as come to treat.</hi> Whilſt <hi>Penneranda</hi> talks at
this rate without end, we are come to the year
1659. in which at laſt the Peace was concluded.</p>
            <p>About the end of the former year 1658. the
King comes through <hi>Burgundy,</hi> that was in ſome
diſorder to <hi>Lyons,</hi> whither came alſo <hi>Chriſtina</hi> the
gallant off-ſpring of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy,</hi>
with her Daughter <hi>Margaret,</hi> who was given out
by report the Perſon that was to be eſpouſed to the
King. Both of them were entertained ſo affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately,
and ſo honourably, as more cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.
Hither too haſtens at a great rate the Duke
of <hi>Savoy,</hi> a Prince of a comely Perſonage, and in the
flower of his Youth. Vigorous Nature ſhewed the
Stock from whence he ſprung, being ſo ſtrong, that
he preſently raiſed an admiration in the minds of
all that ſaw him. Now was the King ſuppoſed to
court <hi>Margaret</hi> as his future Wife; when all on the
ſudden <hi>Pememelli</hi> rides poſte from <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Vill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in ſuch haſte, that he would not ſo much as
to ſtay for a Paſs. After ſecret Conferences between
<hi>Lyonne</hi> and <hi>Pementelli, Pementelli</hi> introduced to
<hi>Mazarine,</hi> reveals the mind of his Maſter about the
Peace, as <hi>Lyonne</hi> had concluded it at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and
that about the Marriage of the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi>
with our King, he might decently inſinuate the
matter, he pretended that <hi>Lyonne</hi> had already inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
it to Duke <hi>Lewis de Haro,</hi> although <hi>Lyonne</hi>
had occaſionally hinted the matter, not by Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
from the King, but of his own head.</p>
            <p>Mazarine <hi>being troubled for the</hi> Savoy <hi>Lady,
who having paſſed the craggy</hi> Alps, <hi>and ſteep Ways
in intolerable Weather would be thought to have
been mocked, reſolves to reveal to her the whole
Intrigue. The</hi> Savoyard <hi>ill diſſembling his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment
of the ſlur put upon his Siſter, flung away
from Court rather then departed. The Mother
impatient, ſtung with vexation preſently after that
her Son was gone very early in the morning, went
and lamented to</hi> Mazarine. What ſhall I do, delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Woman? Shall I go and ſue after the Matches,
which I have already ſlighted, having been inveigled
with a pretended Marriage? Mazarine <hi>pacifieth
her with that ſmoothneſs of Language at which he
was excellent.</hi> That nothing ſhould proceed but to
the Common Good. Matters were at that paſs between
the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> that upon certain
Judgment there was apparent hope of Peace and Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
her Highneſs was of ſo noble a Spirit as to prefer
the publick before her private advantage. If the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Propoſition took not effect, he would do his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
that ſhe ſhould never repent of her Journey and

it to her credit to be deceived, in a deſperate caſe,
acquieſced to</hi> Mazarines <hi>Anſwer, and went away
with</hi> Margaret, <hi>embracing inſtead of a King for her
Husband, his Note. This was the preciſe ſum of
the Ticket.</hi> In caſe the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Match fall off that
<hi>Margaret</hi> the Siſter of the Duky of <hi>Savoy</hi> ſhall be the
Wife of the King of <hi>France Lewis XIV. The King
poſtes away in all haſte to</hi> Paris, <hi>where</hi> Pementelli,
<hi>keeping cloſe for ſome time with</hi> Lyonne, <hi>debated
upon the Articles of the Peace and Marriage. He
was frequently with</hi> Mazarine <hi>in the nights, to
whom, when he would relax nothing in</hi> Condes
<hi>caſe,</hi> Pementelli <hi>accorded;</hi> That <hi>Conde</hi>
ſhould be
reſtored only to his Eſtate, but forfeit his Governments,
and the place of <hi>Grand Maiſtre d'Hoſtel.</hi> Farther,
that <hi>Mazarine</hi> and <hi>Lewis de Haro</hi> ſhould meet at
the <hi>Pyrenaeans,</hi> and after that matters being compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
between the Miniſters, that the two Kings ſhould
have an Enterview to confirm the Articles, and ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
the Marriage between the King of <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>Maria Tereſa</hi> the Infanta of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pementelli</hi> ordered all this to be carried to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi>
by <hi>Courriers,</hi> expecting from his Maſter the
confirmation and ratifying of it, after the uſual
manner.</p>
            <p>Mazarine <hi>imparted this Secret to none but</hi> Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onne,
<hi>which that he might keep from the eyes of the
Common-people, he gave out ſuch pretences for
a colour, even to Strangers;</hi> That the Journey of
<hi>Pementelli</hi> was meerly caſual, as he paſſed from
<hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
               <pb n="395" facs="tcp:101520:204"/>
to <hi>Flanders:</hi> Happening to find the Court at
<hi>Lyons,</hi> that he thought it his Maſters Intereſt, if to
prevent the <hi>Savoy</hi> Match, he did court the <hi>French</hi> by
the Marriage of the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> with the publick
Peace. That ſuch a Match is to this end offered to
put the Emperour into a ſcruple that wiſhes for it, and
to raiſe Jealouſies in the minds of the <hi>Portugueze</hi> and
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> without whoſe knowledge theſe things were
believed to be treated in <hi>France. No Head was
more fruitful of ſuch Inventions than</hi> Mazarines.</p>
            <p>In the month of <hi>June,</hi> in the peaceful year 1659.

he luckily meets a Courrier of <hi>Pementelli</hi> returning
from <hi>Madrid.</hi> He brought with him a Ratification
of the Articles in the Council of <hi>Spain,</hi> extorted

earneſtly deſired him to hold on his Journey

of the ſucceſs; <hi>Pementelli</hi> urged that the more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
becauſe he knew how <hi>Fuenſaldagne</hi> ſtood
inclined, whoſe ſenſe bore great ſway in the mind
of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> Though theſe things were
done in ſecret, yet the Report ſpread; <hi>That the
Peace was ſtifled. In the mean time we were deluded,
for our two months Ceſſation of Arms which the</hi> Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards
<hi>had obtained under colour of the future Treaty.
That they deſigned nothing by that intermiſſion, but
traps in which</hi> Mazarine <hi>is caught.</hi> Theſe and the
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:101520:205"/>
like were broached, especially at <hi>Paris.</hi> Nothin
is ſo given to talk malignantly as that City, ever
ſince it was City.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Haro</hi> in the mean time arrives at S. <hi>Sebaſtians</hi>
with a ſplendid Retinue. <hi>Mazarine,</hi> although
troubled with the Gour, cometh into the Sea-Port
Town (S. <hi>John de Luz</hi> they commonly call it) at
the day appointed. <hi>Haro</hi> ſtayed at <hi>Fuentarabie,</hi>
having paſſed a Complement upon <hi>Mazarine.</hi>

            <p>In the midſt is ſituated an Iſland, receiving its
denomination from the Birds Pheſants, environed
with the River <hi>Bidaſſoa,</hi> lying in common; ſmall
in circuit; narrow as to extent of ground; for the
greatneſs of Tranſactions the braveſt of Iſlands.
There the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> erected for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
a Tabernacle with a double Compartiment,
that avoiding differences about Precedency, the
two Miniſters might meet, and each keep to their
own place.</p>

               <hi>Aug.</hi> 13. 1659. firſt comes <hi>Mazarine</hi> into the

appear the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> a glittering luſtre ſhines on

of place, on one and the other ſide parted
by the Board, ſalute interchangeably, in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Language. The ſtrangeneſs of the ſight amazed
both Nations. It ſeemed a matter incredible, <hi>That
the two principal Confidents of the greateſt Kings who
had lately plotted ſuch cruelties one againſt another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſhould embrace each other unarmed, and inſtead
of military force, and the Stratagems of War, only
contend in Courteſie. Vpon Conference had, both

Some days paſſed whilſt the Inſtructions are
weighed, the agreements made partly at <hi>Madrid,</hi>
partly at <hi>Paris</hi> are recited, more clearly explained,
and ſome committed to the fire to mend all faults.
Hitherto ſo many Propoſals for Peace ineffectual,
while the ſtate of Affairs was unripe. All humane
events are wrapped up in profound darkneſs, their
ſeeds are hidden. But when the Fates pleaſe, all
things contribute, and earneſtly concur. Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells
<hi>Death, during whoſe life there had been no hope
of quiet. No Promiſe made by the King of</hi> France <hi>to
the</hi> Portuguez, <hi>and conſequently no Rub from thence.
Leſs from the</hi> Hollanders, <hi>who had agreed by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
The matter of</hi> Lorraine <hi>gave no difficulty. Among the</hi>
Spaniards <hi>the work of Peace that had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
ſlowly hitherto, was furthered by the Queens
being brought to Red of an Iſſue deſirable to ſway the
Scepter, a young</hi> Enfante <hi>being born. The Vengeance
which was prepared againſt the</hi> Portugal, <hi>and could
not be wrecked upon them while the War continued.
The Indiſpoſition of the King of</hi> Spain. <hi>But what is
the chief, the good underſtanding that was between</hi>
Mazarine <hi>and</hi> Fuenſaldagne; <hi>they were the two Poles
about which the whole Frame rolled.</hi> Only the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of <hi>Conde</hi> had like to have broke ſhort the Web
that was happily upon the Loom; <hi>Fuenſaldagne</hi>
would have been eaſily content to abandon the
Prince, againſt whom he had an Antipathy. <hi>Haro</hi>
bore up on the contrary part, out of tenderneſs for
the publick and his private word. <hi>Mazarine</hi> openly
profeſſes, that he judged it more adviſable to go
away, and undo all that had been done, than make a
Conceſſion ſo diſhonourable to the King of <hi>France.</hi>
               <pb n="398" facs="tcp:101520:206"/>
(That Conceſſion was of <hi>Condes</hi> Governments and
Charges.) <hi>We have already condeſcended too far for
Peaces ſake</hi> (ſaid <hi>Mazarine</hi>) and taxing the unplia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſtiffneſs of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Council. <hi>I am no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
but either I am greatly miſtaken, or I do already
foreſee the day when you will neglect what you now
ſo obſtinately inſiſt upon. In the mean time the blood
which ſhall be ſhed hereafter, will condemn you of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
deſpiſed Peace for</hi> Condes <hi>Intereſts.</hi> This ſaid
the Cardinal, and with that look wherein was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
a grief for the deſpair of Peace.</p>
            <p>At length <hi>Haro</hi> ſeeing the Peace to hang by a
thread, and that a ſlender one, and that <hi>Mazarine</hi>
was inflexible, ſaid, <hi>That his Maſter would rather
beſtow upon</hi> Conde <hi>ſomewhat of his own, than contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

well.</hi> A word dropt from <hi>Haro<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> of giving <hi>Conde</hi>
three Cities. <hi>Mazarine</hi> not unwatchful, catched
the words as they were falling, which at length up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
more clear explanation ſpoke out <hi>Marienburg,
Philipsburg,</hi> and <hi>Avennes</hi> upon the Borders of the

been deſigned and agreed upon.</p>

Narratives do abundantly inform. Nor is it any
wonder, whenas beſides his noble Birth, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
acquired in the Field, Gentileneſs and Bravery
are connatural with him. To avoid the trouble of
a long Train, he rid Poſte, as ſhortning his tedious
way, and declaring the heat of his youthful Maſter.
<hi>Gramont</hi> returned ſure of the Match, having been
entertained ſumptuouſly, and made very welcome.
Between <hi>Mazarine</hi> and <hi>Haro,</hi> whilſt the Treaty
ſtuck, there were ſeveral times thoughts of revoking

            <p>The Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> or their Miniſters flocked
thither, as to conſult an Oracle; they admired the

            <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi> heretofore detained in

waiting upon that King, goes with all ſpeed to
<hi>Haro,</hi> to know the terms impoſed upon him. When
he came to underſtand the condition of his Affairs,
impatient at ſuch a penalty, he broke out into
ſpeeches, which might have given juſt occaſion to
have clapt up again in Priſon the Duke, tired out
with miſeries. <hi>This is not a Peace,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but a
ſlavery by conſent.</hi> The ſingular goodneſs of <hi>Haro</hi>

any other enagagement to act for the reſtoring of
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:101520:207"/>
the King of <hi>England. Mazarine</hi> would not ſo much
as vouchſafe to ſpeak with, or ſee the King for fear
of <hi>Lockhart,</hi> who was a Spye there in behalf of the
Parliament of <hi>England.</hi> It is a thing which poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
will hardly believe. <hi>Mazarine</hi> always hated
<hi>Cromwell,</hi> and the growing Common-wealth, yet
ſo great an apprehenſion of that petty Tyrant was
imprinted on the Cardinals ſoul, that he dreaded
the very Ghoſt of him when he was buried, and
whom he had courted with feigned Honour whilſt
he was alive, he followed with a falſe Veneration
after he was dead. So true it is, that ſome meaner

<hi>The King of</hi> England <hi>having loſt his labour, withdrew
himſelf from the Affront loaded with Complements
from the</hi> Spaniard, <hi>and Contempt from the</hi> French.
Ormond <hi>who accompanied the King, hardly getting
to ſpeak with</hi> Mazarine, <hi>to avoid the giving umbrage,
it ſeems, to</hi> Lockhard, <hi>hinted many things to win up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Cardinal. The aſſured hopes of the Crown
which</hi> Charles <hi>was near recovering, the Plots in favor
of him; all was ſafe, only that there needed ſome
ſmall aſſiſtance. Nay, proceeded ſo far as to ſound</hi>
Mazarines <hi>mind with an Overture of the Royal Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance.
Such is the power of fatal and invincible ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
which the Gods themſelves cannot ſurmount.
All this was to no purpoſe; the Reſtauration was to
be put upon no other account than his perſonal Vertues
and the providence that attended ſo great a King, who
goes away offended at the</hi> French <hi>rigour.</hi>

Arbitrate all things at their pleaſure, and diſpenſe
the Fates of Nations depending upon them. <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> only was neither party, nor par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker

admired at <hi>Rome</hi> that <hi>Chighi,</hi> whom they had
choſen principally upon that account, becauſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been trained up in the Treating of Peace, he
ſeemed a fit Peace-maker, ſhould be ſo ſcornfully
paſſed by. <hi>Mazarine</hi> in his Judgment, after <hi>Chighis</hi>
Judgment, reputed a Fomenter of Diſcord, and
Hater of Peace, ſhews, <hi>That he both could and would
conclude Peace. Things muſt be fitly timed. The

made on both ſides, burning of Towns, ſo many
Priſoners carried away, ſo many Cities ſubdued
and demoliſhed, ſo much blood-ſhed, no Anger left.
In the height of publick Rejoycing, each in their

the paſt Battels, they accounted as Fictions. The
Cities of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> ſhined with Splendour
and Beauty: So that they ſeemed truly Objects of
pity, who were not Subjects of the one Crown, or
the other. The two Miniſters after mutual Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents

            <p>THE Cardinal at <hi>Tholouſe</hi> rendered the
the King and Queen an account of the
Peace concluded, whereat they received
much ſatisfaction. From hence the Court made
a Progreſs into <hi>Provence,</hi> till the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
ſhould come with his Daughter, to compoſe the
diſorders at <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> which had broken out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Priviledges of their <hi>Conſuls.</hi> The King,
the better to ſecure Peace at home, and Reputation
abroad, was neceſſitated to build a Cittadel, having
a plauſible occaſion to preſerve the equal liberties
of the Community, and eſpecially to be a refuge
for ſuch as were of approved fidelity. A mighty
defence without diſtaſte or charge, of which <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi>
is made Governour, than whom no man in
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:101520:209"/>
               <hi>France</hi> had a more formal gravity, having ſerved
two Princes with an even tenour of Prudence.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Paris,</hi> where all things are condemned, the
match was not believed, ſcarcely the Peace; that
there were <hi>Caſtilian</hi> deceits in the bottom, and
<hi>Mazarine</hi> over-reached, not ſo much the Common
People in the ſtreets and at clubs, as many of the
Noblemen did whiſper.</p>
            <p>Conde <hi>having ſurvived ſo many Battels, being
certified of the State of Affairs, after he had cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly
ſaluted his Souldiers, according to their
ſtanding or office, ſpoke to them much after this
ſort;</hi> It is the ſeventh year, Fellow-Souldiers, ſince
having been toſſed by hard Fates, after the extreameſt
inſtances of Barbarous uſage, being releaſed out of
a dark Dungeon, I left the Kingdom of my Anceſtors,
obliged to ſecure my life by Arms. All the time my
Fates, and the Fortune of my Family, have been put
into your hand. Now, neither to inflame your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
any further to the love of me, nor to excite
your Spirits to give new proofs of your Valour, (for
both are abundadtly manifeſt) but I come hither to
requeſt of you an allay of your Courage, and a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of your kindneſs towards me; that is, that
you would be ſatisfied with the quiet that is already
gotten mankind. Nor that we ſhould bandy your
and other mens Fortunes reſtleſs, between hope and
fear; ſeeing that we can perform no better ſervice,
the Fates of <hi>France</hi> importing us. The Peace of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and my own ſafety is ſecured, with your ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and that of <hi>Flanders,</hi> I do quietly poſseſs in
<hi>France,</hi> both the Priviledges of my houſe, and the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
which I formerly poſſeſſed, and the Fortunes
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:101520:210"/>
left by my Honoured Father. In a word, my eſtate
is in ſuch condition, that I neither need comfort nor
revenge. I and Fortune have tryed our ſtrength; we
have contended a great while: I will now ſhew the
example of contending no further. Others have been
longer engaged in Civil Wars, none hath come off
more contentedly. Should I ſuffer ſo many brave
Armies, ſo many Commanders, to be again beaten
down, and without cauſe expoſe this Valour of yours
to dangers. Let this frame of ſpirit continue, as
though ye would dye for me, but ſurvive. The more
hope you ſhow, if I were willing to fight, the braver
will Peace be. But when I ſee ſo many maimed
Limbs, ſo many Wounds; that is it which afflicts my
Heart. Whether will your old years, now when
your blood is exhausted, go for relief? What ſhall be
the ſettlement for you, when paſt ſervice? What Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignments
of Land after your fruitleſs Compagnes?
Since at the preſent I am diſ-abled from requiting
you according to your merits, the one thing which I
have; in this juncture of Affairs I leave you eternal
Gratitude, and the example of my Life. Time will
be, when perhaps my houſe may be able to afford a
donative; in the mean time, receive theſe ſmall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
indeed, but ſuch as teſtifie our perpetual
love. <hi>Thereupon the remnant of money which he
had, was divided among the Souldiers in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
After that the Aſſembly had long murmured
in uncertain Senſes,</hi> Marſin <hi>the</hi> Liegois, <hi>in behalf
of the Troops, without any Rhetorical Artifice,
Souldier-like thus ſpoke.</hi>

            <p>Moſt Invincible Prince, the greateſt Commander of
the <hi>French</hi> Nation. Military Diſcipline conſiſts
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:101520:210"/>
more in obeying, then queſtioning the Orders of our
Officers; we have Arms and Courage, we leave to
you Counſel and the conduct of our Valour. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
not to us to enquire into the Cauſes of Peace,
nor to pry into the Breaſts of Kings. Our Truth and
Reputation hath continued to this day unſtained to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
your Highneſs. We have equally ſhared the
hazards and uncertainties of War; You always firſt
beat the path of dangers, we following your Colours,
have learned ſo often from you to dye. The iſſue of
Rebellions cometh upon us, the glory of Battels upon
you. Our ſervice, with you, hath been Gentle and
Courteous, You have vouchſafed Pardon to our
Errors, paſt by our ſlips, and never called our Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
or Diſgraces Diſcipline. Take not care for
our Rewards, or whither we ſhall go; Fortune will
ſet us in a way. We have a great monument of
glory, that you cannot complain of us. Go your way
Saint and Merciful; Souldier and Invincible; We
do Eternally Love and pray for you. The Immortal
Gods grant you this Bleſſing, that you may never have
occaſion to think of us. <hi>Thus much ſaid</hi> Marſin
<hi>openly concerning himſelf, theſe few words to him
aſide,</hi> You know at what rate I have purchaſed you:
ſeek a name for the Action, adviſe with the voice of
the World; if it be Rebellion, I did it for your
ſake.</p>
            <p>The Prince, with a pleaſing look, gave good
attention to all this, and adviſed the younger with
Authority, the elder with entreaty. The next
day, having called the Nobles of the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
to his Houſe, he declared to them the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of the Peace, and the tetms. Of himſelf he
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:101520:211"/>
ſpoke little and cautiouſly; of the Publick largely.
The Cities earneſtly offered him Preſents, Praiſes,
Applauſe; he refuſed all, yet permitted thanks to
be given him, but nevertheleſs did not vain-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
provoke Fame, attending rather till the
heat of applauding was over: his departure was
graced with much Complement. At that time he
delivered up the Provinces in quiet and ſafety to
<hi>Caracene;</hi> And leſt his Entry into great Cities
ſhould be remarkable for the Pomp and Multitude
of ſuch as came to meet him, both in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and
eſpecially in <hi>France,</hi> he avoided them, and the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendances
of his Friends; but went with a ſmall
Retinue, plain in Garb, and courteous in diſcourſe.
The Duke of <hi>Enguien</hi> never parted from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Company, needing no ſtranger to be his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour.
Through <hi>Vervin</hi> and <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> and then
<hi>Culmar</hi> which is a Town of Brie, famous for a
Seat of his Brother-in-Law <hi>Longueville;</hi> he came
through ſharp Froſts and rugged Ways; there he
made ſome ſtay to mend his Tackle, and recruit
his Health. None were admitted to ſee him, but
ſuch as were ſent for; he had in company his Wife
and Son, with his only Daughter, ſcarce three
years old; a part only of his Family ragged, naſty,
and ſmelling of Dutchery, Baniſhment, and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Wars. It was judged fit for <hi>Longueville</hi> to go
before, to break the way for his acceſs to the King.
The Prince having left his Wife and <hi>Enguien</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
went after, not in a loitering pace, leſt he
might ſeem to be timerous, nor yet haſtily; but
letting the report of him grow by expectation, he
turns his courſe to <hi>Madam Chaſtillons,</hi> for whom
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:101520:211"/>
he ever had a kindneſs when he was young, being
his Kinſwoman, and handſom; which gave him a
double title of Love; but that was no hinderance
to the minding his buſineſs. At length he comes
to <hi>Aix,</hi> which is the principal Town of <hi>Provence;</hi>
that was agreed upon to be the place for his wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon his Majeſty to kiſs his Hands. They
come in multitudes to meet him: amongſt the reſt,
his brother <hi>Conti,</hi> who having left the Monaſtery,
whither he had put himſelf, and Married <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines</hi>
Neice, had left, ſome good time ſince, his
brothers Army and Party. <hi>Conde</hi> receives him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately;
<hi>Mazarine</hi> was put into ſome trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at the coming of ſo great a ſuppliant, yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
him with a chearful countenance, which was
not uſual with him. Four miles off they ſend
Coaches, Horſes; and a Guard, in ſhow of Honour.
The Prince is received by <hi>Mazarine</hi> at the Stair-Head;
there were ſtreight Embraces, words heard
by none; divers diſcourſes paſſed to and fro, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
permitting any to ſtand by. <hi>Longueville</hi> and
<hi>Conti</hi> himſelf, although he ſhined with his Brothers
image, ſtanding in the crowd among the Servants;
<hi>Mazarine</hi> went alone into the Preſence-Chamber,
whither within a quarter of an hours time, <hi>Conde</hi>
being called in, falls down at the Kings feet, but
was preſently raiſed up, as is uſual on ſuch an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
the firſt word was moſt attentively watched
for, but inſtead of that, was a courteous whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that one would ſoon have imagined a hearty
reconciliation. After this, having viſited the
Queen and <hi>Anjou,</hi> he preſented the choice Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
of his Army <hi>Boutteville</hi> and <hi>Merſin,</hi> and
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:101520:212"/>
the reſt, not concealing the Vertues of each. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin</hi>
disfigured more then any elſe with ſcars re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
for <hi>Conde,</hi> no leſs confounded with the Kings
bounty, as the memory of his own carriage, and
the publick hatred; the cauſe of which was the
more grievous, in that it was juſt; caſting his eyes
on the ground, acquitted himſelf with only looking
up to <hi>Conde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Conde</hi> there was no abjectneſs, no pride, no
change of temper in a change of Condition; his
mind had on the ſudden wheeled about from Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
and Guilt, to Majeſty. He admitted all
mirth and plenty, applyed himſelf to ſuch as flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about him, and expatiated in Flatteries, having
a quick Wit in a graceful return of Complements.
Whatſoever he ſaid or did, although without Art,
delighted the ears and eyes of them that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
Further, that he might allay the name of
Souldier, which ſounds harſh amongſt the idle
Courtiers; with other vertues, he avowed his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of following a quiet and peaceful life.
One might have ſeen faces ſhining with a ſudden
cheerfulneſs, the cloud of ſo many part troubles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a ſhort time ſcattered. So much power had
that brightneſs of blood, that of ſucceſſes, and
what is above all, nothings being difficult to <hi>Conde</hi>'s
Fates. Thus having ſpent about eight days, he
returns back the ſame way, hearing as he came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
the death of the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> of whom I
ſhall ſpeak afterwards. He that in work, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the march lately conſorted with the Common-Souldier
in <hi>Flanders,</hi> reſerving intire the Authority
of a General; at <hi>Paris</hi> vies with the moſt Courtly
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:101520:212"/>
Lords in Ceremony and Complements. As mens
Affections were forward, <hi>Conde</hi>'s Wit increaſed his
Reputation, being adequate to any fortune what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever;
the gracefulneſs of his Countenance with a
certain Majeſty, his proſperity, mens minds bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards him; and inſtead of all his Fortune.
To have eſcaped ſo many imminent miſchiefs, be
reſtored to his houſe, advanced in glory. One
might ſee the Prinees Palace, from early in the
morning, till late at night, ſwarm with people;
Men come out of curioſity, return with content,
cannot be ſatisfied with gazing; admire the ſame
vertue, which lately they hated; his youthful af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and which had been heretofore looſe, now

for the better, and though he were but middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged,
as to years, yet was he reported to have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd
the longeſt time of life as to Glory.</p>
            <p>Theſe things were heard at Court, and believed
to be more then in truth they were; his Popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
was condemned; and it was diſliked, that he
had received Biſhops with courteſie above the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
rate; that he had nailed Mourning to the
top of his Coach for the death of <hi>Orleans.</hi> It is a
Cuſtom which is paſt into a Law, that none may
aſſume this to themſelves, beſides the immediate
iſſue of Kings. He that had ſo often nailed Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
dares not now nail his Coach. The Prince
complains of miſchief in the new Court, equally
grievous, but not equally condemned: yet modeſtly
as amongſt his Maſters, thanked <hi>Mazarine</hi> for
giving him ſuch advice. For the avoiding theſe
and the like jealouſies, he reſolves to leave the City
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:101520:213"/>
for a time, and retire, into <hi>Burgundy.</hi>(The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of that <hi>Province</hi> which had been reſtored
him, was the Pretence) nor to ſpread his ſail any
more to prejudicial Fame, but ſeek a cure of his
Troubles from lying ſtill. He takes along with
him young <hi>Enguien,</hi> already ſhewed, to the Fates,
that he might produce him among the Peoples.
It will not be amiſs to obſerve, that the <hi>Lorrainers</hi>
and <hi>Guiſes</hi> payed their reſpects, to the Prince by
Proxy, leſt they ſhould walk lower-moſt, and on
the left hand in his houſe. They complained, that
he obſerved this practice which his Father had neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
and remitted.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> born of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth,

having laid down the Civil Arms, would paſs off
the diſcontents that were riſen in his Spirit, for

No longer did he give himſelf over to be ruled by

<hi>I remember and have reaſon to remember.</hi> The hour
drew on of breaking up the Company, when <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
framing occaſions of delay, at length gave his
daughter a parting-kiſs, and bid her his laſt fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel.
The Queen Mother did almoſt throw her
ſelf into her Brothers Arms, but he out of <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
gravity would not admit her. This was the order
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:101520:214"/>
at the entring into the League of Peace.</p>
            <p>Having left the Iſland, whole memory will be
grateful to all poſterity, they were thus parted ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
more to return to the ſight of one another. At
S. <hi>John de Luz,</hi> next day a ſolemn Wedding was
kept with unuſual Splendour; withou any ſtay that
barren Sea-coaſt and unhoſpitable Quarters are
abandoned. All greedily long after <hi>Paris.</hi> It was
thought convenient to ſtay a while at <hi>Fountainbel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leau;</hi>
thereby giving the <hi>Pariſians</hi> reſpit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for the pompous Solemnity. <hi>Mazarine</hi> all
the Journey long, grown more moroſe than he uſed
to be, not cheared with any recreation, not ſo much
as with winning at Play, diſcovered to the King
ſeveral times that his time of diſſolution approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The King could not forbear weeping. In the
mean while the Cardinals Indiſpoſition delayed
the coming to Town; whoſe Infirmity at length
abating, and all things being prepared, the King
with the Queen Conſort haſtned his Entry into
die City.</p>
            <p>The Entry was next to a Triumph. In a <hi>Dom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>
               </hi>
ſet up in the Suburb of S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> both their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
were congratulated by the ſeveral Orders co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
forth decently marſhalled. Firſt came the
Eccleſiaſticks (in point of Honour they ſhould have
came laſt) carrying Images with them, and antick
Gods, of rude Workmanſhip. After the Companies
of Tradeſmen proceeded the Magiſtrate, then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the Parliament in their Robes. Afterwards
the Chanellour, laid all over with Gold, the Maſters
of Requeſts guarding the Royal Seal, charged upon
a Horſe loaded with Trappings. The Souldiers
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:101520:215"/>
and the Heralds in rich Coats. All had ſpotted
Plumes in their Hats. The Captains marched in
the Head of their Companies with the Enſigns. All
ſort of Riches is diſplayed, and the Ornaments of
the City are fetched to grace the Publick Joy. A
Coach embelliſhed with all the Badges of Majeſy
is brought to the Queen. She is ſet in it alone.
The King would not go in a Coach; but mounted
on a gallant Steed, rid before. The Princes on
Horſe-back followed immediately after. The joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
City thronging on both ſides, looked earneſtly
upon the Queen; being aware, that in her Chariot
was the chiefeſt of all Victories. Joyfulneſs at the
Sight was provoked by variety of Sounds. In the
way all along as they came were Quires of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Muſicians reſounding cheerful Airs in Conſorts
of Inſtrumental and Vocal Melody. The new-married
Pair came amidſt this Pomp to the City-Gate.
At the Entrance was ſet up aloft an Image
of Peace, holding forth in its right hand divers
Verſes. They proceeded from the Port through
the High-ſtreets of the City to the <hi>Louvre,</hi> even
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>red with Joy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mazarine</hi> having performed this magnificent So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity,
propoſed to eaſe the people of Taxes, to
ſuccour the Allies, to encourage Navigation for
War and Merchandiſe, to reform the <hi>French</hi> Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Laws, to beautifie the City with ſtately
Buildings, and finiſh the <hi>Louvre,</hi> the moſt glorious
Monument of this Age; which being ſet acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
on fire, was warning and fore-runner of what
what was approaching. He did not continue in
the bleſſed Light of this World, cruel Fortune diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointing
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:101520:215"/>
theſe Intentions. Scarce were ſix
months expired after the Entry of the King, when
taken deſperately with all the Symptoms of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treameſt
pain, he gave preſages of his fatal hour.
In nothing ſlack, but in Cure of his Infirmity. His
Liver and Lungs diſtempered, cauſing a general
feebleneſs in all his Limbs, threw back ſomewhat
impenetrable by the learned Faculty, although,
what is ſtrange, the putrefaction ſcarce amounted
to a Feaver. After that it was clearly underſtood,
that there remained no hope in the Phyſicians, the
more skilful of whom gave their Judgment of his
being dangerouſly ill, he drew to <hi>Vincennes</hi> there
to dye; as though Fortune would be leſs taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of in committing the crime without than with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the City. The King commanded he ſhould be
left to his reſt, and diſturbed with no buſineſs. His
Vertue ſtood always unwounded, and never touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Having his Soul inſenſible of any evil, he clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhewed how vile the body is to them that have
great glory in their eye. Having his thoughts ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up about nothing more than the Glory of the
Kingdom (whoſe riſe and growth one may ſay that
he aſſiſted) he is reported to have ſuggeſted many
things of the various Schemes of Policy, to the King
who generally ſate by his Bed-ſide. A long time
they kept ſilence with mournful looks, reſtraining
tears before either begun the bitter diſcourſe. The
King moſt obligingly commending his Merits,
deferred to him the ſucceſs of his Arms. <hi>Our Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories,</hi>
ſaith he <hi>are your Work. You have ſweetned the
hazard, you the misfortunes, you the labours of War.
You have preſerved my Crown. At length you fall a
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:101520:216"/>
Sacrifice after ſo many propitious ſucceſſes obtained for
me. Whilſt I ſhall uſe my Eſtate reſtored by you, I ſhall
oftner remember all this hath been received from you,
than you ever thought that you gave it. I will enjoy
the goods gotten by your Counſel, and ſhall underſtand
from the uſe what you have beſtowed upon me.</hi> The
Nobles ſtanding round attended, and ſhrowded
moſt different thoughts under a common ſilence,
being prepared to ſway their affections which way
ſoever the Diſcourſes of the King and <hi>Mazarine</hi>
ſhould incline them. <hi>Mazarine,</hi> although he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
all this to be true, which had been ſaid, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
as became his modeſty; <hi>That all muſt be put
upon Account to the Kings Cauſe and Felicity: that
himſelf too had received an ineſtimable favour to have
the Honour to meddle with his moſt holy Arms and
Counſels.</hi> Afterwards wiſely admoniſhed the King,
<hi>That himſelf would undertake the Government of his
State, and not create a publick Jealouſie by ill choſen
Favourites: That he ſhould have the ſame Genius, and
the ſame Divine Aſſiſtance of his Counſel to rule, as he had to obtaine his Victories.</hi> Many Secrets he farther
Inſtilled into the King, opening his Majeſties eyes.
As they were thus diſcourſing together, many times
he fainted away. When all hope was quite paſt,
the King departed, leſt his voice, ratling through
weakneſs, might loſe its Majeſty; his grief turning
to thoughts, what was to come after. Amongſt
all the tokens of extreme torment, yet no pains did
extort a groan or complaint. The ſame ſetled
look which he had when he was well, accompanied
him at his departure. Juſt as if he had been to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
for a Journey, folding and laying up his Papers
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:101520:216"/>
in thier order, and locking up his Desk, he did even
temper his diſcourſe with facetiouſneſs. In this
time he ſigned his Will. As to the main, his mind
was unaltered: In particulars he made ſome
change; leaving the King his Heir, but many Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatees:
Then he adopted <hi>Du Port</hi> the only Son of
<hi>Meilleray</hi> into the Priviledges of his Blood, recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
an old Cuſtom out of uſe, to whom he gave
his Niece in Marriage, and conveyed him his
Name and Arms, being for his Merits taken into
equal dearneſs, as if he had been his own Son. He
advanced his Nephew <hi>Mancini</hi> in Governments,
Lordſhips, and Riches. Theſe were to ſhare equally.
Of his Attendants and Menial Servants none almoſt
was left without a Legacy. Somewhat too he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed
to Learning. He ordered the building a
Colledge for the training up of Youth, of the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Provinces, and Acquiſt of Territory, to have this
Motto, <hi>A Monument of the Empire enlarged.</hi> He
earneſtly intreated the King, <hi>To confirm and ratifie
whatſoever he had ordered, being it was his laſt Will,
he had hopes of help from Equity, and for that
Equity, from the King.</hi> The King paſt his word
to him; <hi>Ask,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>what you will from Vs, it
will be leſs than your Merits.</hi> He left a plentiful, he
might have left an immenſe Eſtate, having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Treaſury; which is not to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to ill practices, but his careful Miniſtry. At
this time eſpecially he recommended by particular
Character <hi>John Baptiſta Colbert,</hi> in whom as he
profeſſed he loved many qualities, ſo eſpecially his
faithfulneſs and his induſtry, and with his moſt
piercing Judgment, ſincerity unknown to the moſt
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:101520:217"/>
of men. One whom no body ever could, and who
would deceive no body. Having a vaſt quantity
of Jewels, he diſtributed them among ſeveral. <hi>Conde</hi>
eſpecially in teſtimony of injuries forgotten, he gave
a Diamond of no mean price: The King he left
eighteen that were ineſtimable, ſtyled <hi>Mazarines,</hi>
to propagate his Name and Renown to poſterity:
His fair Eſtate without any alteration of the courſe
deſcended upon the deſigned Heirs. By habitual
pains he was ſo beaten to ſufferings, that when he
was ready to dye, he had an appearance of cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
All the blood in his Veins being out of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and his Lungs obſtructed with the very dregs,
ſtopped his breath. Shewing the bare Bones and
his Belly ſwollen with a Dropſie, he informed how
frail a thing that is which is of greateſt account in
this World. When his weak body was forced to
yield to the power of the diſeaſe, no Phyſick being
available againſt fatal neceſſity, when certain ſigns
of death appeared, the Counſel of Phyſicians with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew.
For they ſay it is improper, that they who
ought to be Helpers of life, ſhould be Spectators of
death. They could not at all agree in the Nature
of his Diſeaſe, about which all the time that they
had him under Cure, they were at ſore difference.
Some of them concealing the deſperateneſs of his
caſe out of policy, others out of ignorance. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ten, ſometimes twelve, at the feweſt there
were ſix enough to have killed one that were in
perfect health. Being of a ſtout and invincible
Spirit, he applied the remnant of life, which he
found left him to Meditations of Death: and at
laſt <hi>March</hi> 15. which month Diviners had foretold
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:101520:217"/>
would be fatal to him, he paſſed from this mortal
life at <hi>Vincennes.</hi> On the very ſame day dyed that
other <hi>Julius</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> Not a few grieved to pleaſe
the King; the reſt tranſported, pleaſed themſelves
with the liberty of mourning. The King was
heartily ſorry. The Court was hung with Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and all that would be in the faſhion, went into
Blacks.</p>
            <p>Thus deceaſed the moſt potent of all Favourites
that ever were, in the year of his Life 59. of his
Power 18. In <hi>France</hi> all that time he reigned in
abſolute Authority, Majeſty ever ſaved, turning all
things with his Look, the reſt being but a Company
of Vaſſals. He was obſervant of Religion, as to
the external Acts of Worſhip: For when he drew
nigh to his latter end, after the Chriſtian faſhion, he
did ſolemnly receive the Euchariſt to aſſiſt him in
his Paſſage, and with a devout Litany received Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
Unction. Nay farther requeſted, that Maſſes
might be ſaid for him. All was performed in the
Temples with extraordinary diligence; and God
expoſed upon the Altars. Supplications were
made before all the Saints. Zealous for the See of
<hi>Rome,</hi> beyond meaſure; whether out of hopes of
the triple Crown, to which he was a bold Pretender
after the Concluſion of the Peace; or out of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
reſpect, or out of Art: Whatever it be at his
earneſt requeſt, the Popes <hi>Nuncio</hi> bleſt him, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
God.</p>
            <p>He was one of no ordinary preſence: his ſtature
rather of a neat cut than tall, with a high forehead:
one would readily judge him a mild man. His
acceſs at the firſt gate was guarded by a ſullen Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:101520:218"/>
but to ſuch as could happily get clear through
the throng, and frowardneſs of the Sentinel in at
the Wicket, his Reception was courteous. So great
a power had he over his Countenance and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
that when he would moſt conceal his Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
he ſeemed moſt open-hearted: ſo artificially
couching his words, that a man would eaſily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
he meant to perform more than he promiſed.
Confident he was of reconcilement, ſo as to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of all, he would admit ſuch as were lately
his Enemies, again to be next his perſon; and inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
Companions at his Buſineſs and Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
having already pardon for thoſe that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and no puniſhment for the ſtubborn. His
natural abilities he improved by induſtry, for great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Affairs he would manage himſelf, ſparing of ſleep
and eaſe, but not by Aſſiſtants. Being aware of the
uſes of money, he was counted thrifty of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
covetous of his own. But for Bravery of the
Accommodations and Furniture of his own Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
for multitude of Lacquais and Pages, above
great Princes. No ſeat of theirs is more magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
than <hi>Mazarines</hi> Houſe; as though he alone
ſhould ſhew Strangers the Wealth and Power of
<hi>France.</hi> Nor was this diſtaſtful to the King from
whom he redeemed all ſuſpicion of pride by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſe
and ſubmiſſion. He pryed into the Secrets of
Kingdoms and private Perſons. I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ever man was more accompliſhed to delude
the <hi>French.</hi> He would buoy up hopes with cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
Applications, and would enlarge Nobility
with the offer of Titles: carrying himſelf ſo fairly,
that every where he might appear freed from the
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:101520:218"/>
being apprehended to have done wrong. But ſo
faſt in keeping counſel, that he was wholly inacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
even to thoſe that were reputed his greateſt
Confidents. He would never brag any thing in
vanity of words. Towards proſperity and adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
he bore an even face, not mind. And though
great he was accounted whilſt he ſtood; in his fall,
and when he was down, he appeared greater. In
truth, by his Courage he deſerved that his Calamity
ſhould at laſt turn to his Glory. Being given to
diſſimulation, he yielded an ear to Suſpicions and
Slanderers. Large in promiſes, which oftentimes
he did not perform; or if he did make them good,
the Courteſie was long pondered with ſcruples and
delay, and extorted by importunity, ſo that he
made it unſerviceable, conſuming the joy with the
tediouſneſs of expectation. Sometimes he reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Vertue, but never went forth to meet it. And
that upon acquaintance, with the <hi>French</hi> Temper,
which preſently upon receiving one favour, thinks
of a new one. He fell under Infamy, ſeldom for
his own, many times for others actions. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity
of Fortune often overcame his Arts, and in
him Fate was too hard for Vertue. In ſo great a
happineſs of Nature, there was an eminent compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of all exquiſite qualities, which were conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent
with tranſcendent Vertues. The Reputation
of Clemency he ſtood upon, even when ſeverity had
been expedient to abſolute Government. By Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs
he arrived to that Praiſe, with which many
many have grown famous by violent and rigorous
courſes. In truth no innocent Ghoſts will torture
him, no publick Evils, nor domeſtick can juſtly be
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:101520:219"/>
reproached upon him. He deſerved well of our
Anceſtors and Poſterity, having increaſed the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
by the acceſſion of Territory, and not impaired
it by any emin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt loſs. It muſt be marked, that he
fell into times different to <hi>Richlieu</hi>'s. He had moſt
ſore Enemies that rivalled a Woman and a Child.
Being haughtily ſecure through his own Conſcience,
and the Kings Love, he ſtoutly waged, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
finiſhed a War that had been raſhly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken.
Comparable to any of the Ancients for
profoundneſs of Underſtanding, he was buried
amidſt the Applauſes of Victory in his own Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.</p>

<pb n="426" facs="tcp:101520:220"/>
talked of at Court, at leſt about the end of the
month of <hi>July, Anno</hi> 1661. broke out upon
the head of <hi>Nicholas Fouquet,</hi> who was Arreſted,
as he returned from the Kings Council. He was
carried into the Caſtle of <hi>Angers;</hi> from thence to
<hi>Vincennes,</hi> and at laſt to the <hi>Baſtille.</hi> The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the blow ſeconded the wiſhes of his Friends,
none offering to interpoſe between him and that
ſtroke, which was ſet on by ſo Powerful a hand.
He was a man of a noble Spirit, but ruined by his
good Nature, and blinded by Proſperity; (if it
may be called Proſperity, the diſpoſing of a vaſt
Treaſure) being neither rightly acquainted with
his own Station, nor the falſhood of Flatterers; he
fell not out of a greedineſs of hoarding, but of ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Money. Yet none appeared in his defence
when he came in trouble, ſo widely had he offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and in ſuch a compaſs, as if he had made that
his only buſineſs. He is not the only perſon that
this Mask hath trapanned, the ſame Viſour hath
deluded thouſands. Where is the man who hath
eſcaped out of theſe Nets, but hath left ſome fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
upon this Bird-lime; the luſt of women too
playing about ſuch ſtreams of Gold. The King
paſſed no fierce, no haſty ſentence, but gave the
Priſoner time to give in his own and others miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours.
He erected a Court of honeſt men,
choſen out of every Parliament of <hi>France,</hi> leſt their
power ſhould be corrupted if they had been few:
Theſe were, by Commiſſion, to make inquiry into
the Embezelling the Publick Money, to diſcover
by what Caverns, what Gulfs it was waſted:
The young King would have his Chequer improve
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:101520:220"/>
in height; Reſtraint was needful, though late; yet
there was no penalty laid upon <hi>Fouquet,</hi> but that of
Baniſhment. See the ſtorms and toſſings of life,
that no Wiſdom can ever regulate in the ſlippery
Pinnacle and Precipice of the Court. It is a hard
matter, in any ſort of life, ſo to behave ones ſelf,
as not to trip; and it is a great gift of nature to
have common ſenſe, and not preſume too much
upon Fortune.</p>

Seguier <hi>performing his Chancellours part in the
Parliament, reported the Kings Act with a proper
Oration; in the Privy Council he diſcharged his
duty, that</hi> the Blood Royal could not be transfuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

have them adopted, who had once the boldneſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for the Kingdom; that the preſent Fortune of
the King is above all diſpute: Emergencies and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
events are above all Royal Power: that the
States of the Kingdom would eternally condemn Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants
that carried a ſnare in them. When the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of the Kingdom is in queſtion, they would not be
velued without their conſent; <hi>that</hi> ſuch matters do
not depend upon a Queens fruitfulneſs, nor the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
Age of a King; for a numerous Iſſue Royal
hath been more then once ſeen of a ſudden turned

forbear, but according to the duty of his Place, he
ſhould mention this boldly indeed; but modeſtly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
all to the Kings Judgment. Lyonne <hi>replyed
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:101520:221"/>
a word on the place; that,</hi> the King was not much
concerned in what ſhould be the conteſts of Poſterity;
<hi>that</hi> a vaſt acceſſion was purchaſed at a <hi>Chimera.</hi>
It were a very high Crime to queſtion the eternity of
the <hi>Bourbons. Therefore the matter was reſolved
upon, the Kings Authority turning the Scale,
though the</hi> Vendoſms, Longuevilles, <hi>and</hi> Courtneys
<hi>drew againſt it; yet theſe forbore to make any
preſent ſtir, being certified of</hi> Charles<hi>'s repentance,
and the retirement of his Nephew and Name-ſake
into</hi> Germany. <hi>What will be the iſſue, muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The chief Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> had ſent their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
to <hi>Charles</hi> II. King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> for
the eſtabliſhing his Authority, not yet any long time
re-ſetled. Whileſt Count <hi>Brahe</hi> ſent by the <hi>Swede,</hi>
prepares his Entry into <hi>London, Octob.</hi> 10. Of the
preceding year, there aroſe a contention between
<hi>Eſtrade,</hi> the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Batteville</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour,
whoſe Coach ſhould take place in the
proceeding. <hi>Batteville</hi> hired him ſome of the
baſer ſort of people in <hi>London;</hi> then whom none
are more forward to mutiny, that once in his life
he might get his King one petty triumph over the
<hi>French:</hi> Therefore at the ſet day the ſordid rout
vented their Spleen upon the Attendants of <hi>Eſtrade,</hi>
having butchered his Coachman and Horſes, and
ſome of his Servants; the <hi>Spaniard</hi> continued Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the Field. The King of <hi>England</hi> turned the
blame upon the Common People, which by reaſon
of his being newly reſtored, he could not at the
preſent reſtrain. The <hi>French</hi> Kings indignation
diſcharged upon <hi>Batteville</hi> only: More noble
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:101520:222"/>
Anger hath not at any time elſe appeared. In ſuch
a juncture, whatſoever Prudence ſuggeſts, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed
Prince ſcorns, ruſhing only upon reve ge.
He baniſhes from the Veerge of the Court, the
Count <hi>Fuelſaldagne,</hi> not reſpecting his Integrty,
and that he had been Conductor of the Queen, who
was the pledge of Peace. He alſo denyed <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene,</hi>
that was diſcharged of the Government of
the Low-Countries, a paſſage through <hi>France</hi> in
his return for <hi>Spain.</hi> And as though the Kings
wrath were not ſatisfied with all this, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Yverdon,</hi> who was then at <hi>Madrid</hi> upon
the Kings account, is ordered not only to demand
of <hi>Philip</hi> himſelf, that <hi>Batteville,</hi> who had offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
might be puniſhed according to the hainouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſs
of the offence; but to cut off all contention
about Precedency for the future, that the. <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Renunciation of all Priority, might be eſtabliſhed
by a Publick Act. The fierce <hi>Spaniard</hi> hardly
digeſts it, and whilſt he debates the queſtion, the
<hi>French</hi> Embaſſadour keeps at home, laying down
his publick quality, as though he had deveſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of all Priviledge. But Paternal affection bore
ſway. <hi>Philip</hi> waving the Regal Dignity, puts on
the Father, thinking it not unglorious to give way
to him, to whom he had given his Bowels. But
leſt this <hi>Spaniſh</hi> conſent ſhould vaniſh into Air, it
was to be confirmed by a ſolemn Embaſſy. The
Marqueſs <hi>Fuentes,</hi> choſen for that purpoſe, comes
to <hi>Paris</hi> with a great Train. The King, that he
might make the Audience more glorious at an
act of that high Nature, would have the Popes
<hi>Nuncio,</hi> the Embaſſadours of <hi>Venice, Swethland,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:101520:222"/>
Savoy,</hi> the United Provinces, and all Foreign Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
to be preſent; as alſo the Peers of the
Realm, the Chancellour and four Secretaries to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter
it. <hi>Fuentes</hi> having been experienced in State-Affairs,
and divers Embaſſies, was not ſurprized at
the luſtre of ſo great an Aſſembly. Therefore
taking that concourſe, not as a witneſs of abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Honour, but turning it to his Glory, thus
ſpoke to the King: <hi>There being nothing more upon
the King my Maſters Heart, then Religiouſly to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Laws of Conſanguinity: He hath ſent me
hither with a charge to confirm them; which at his
Perſonal preſence, he eſtabliſhed with his Royal mouth.
His Perſon I ſuſtain this day, not repreſenting a King,
that knows not to yield, but a Father, whoſe ſpirit
only nature works to a compliance. He hath thought
fit voluntarily, to quit to you thoſe Tranſitory Honours
which he hath enjoyed ſo long; ſince, ſhortly, Death is
like to put a period to them. Thoſe Gallantries may
become your Age; Such youthful ambition, an old
Man, and your Father-in-law envies not. The</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<hi>Out-rage hath ſunk deeper into his, then your
Heart; he could not more effectually redreſs it, than
by puniſhing the Author. The Revocation of</hi> Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,
<hi>is a publick declaration of inflicting puniſhment
on him. But what could have been added more to
this, then to lay ſtrict Injunctions, that his
Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,
for the future, do not contend with yours about
Precedency. This is the occaſion of the Embaſsy,
which I the rather perform, becauſe the Peace lately
concluded, is hereby confirmed; May it ſtand in full
force to all Generations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King receiving ſatisfaction in his due Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:101520:223"/>
gave him a nod when he had concluded his
Speech, reſerving to himſelf the whole <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
State, with their Homage. He adviſed the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours
to be mindful of what had paſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
to their reſpective Princes what they had ſeen
and heard. At the breaking up of the Aſſembly,
<hi>Lewis</hi> appeared more <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be alſo called a Victory without blood,
when the King bought of the <hi>Engliſh, Dunkirk</hi> for
ready Money. What matters it whether ſo ſtrong,
ſo conſiderable Garriſons come by Gold or Steel?
and the Nation planted in the Kingdom of <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi>
be excluded from the Continent?</p>
            <p>The ſame year, 1662. The King, by Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
commanded the <hi>Tenets</hi> of the <hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by <hi>Innocent</hi> X. and <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. to be
aboliſhed. The New Sect received its denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from <hi>Cornelius Janſen,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ypers,</hi> who
about the 40 year of this Age, put out a Book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<hi>Grace and Free Will;</hi> wherein he is beleived
to have faſtened to St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> a ſenſe contrary to
that Doctors mind. But I confine my ſelf within
my own bounds, and do not climb thoſe heights,
leſt like an ill <hi>Tyler,</hi> I ſhould fall from the Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top,
and be laugh'd at. In the better part of the
World, what broyls hath an itch of Arguing about
Religion made? that which doth, and hath, and
will occaſion this, is mans weakneſs, of which there
is no more certain Argument, then to quarrel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
ſacred matters. It is a Diſeaſe of the Soul to
make ſuperfluous queſtions about God; but what
can we do? Divines had rather diſpute their live.
It is commendable to reſtrain a Gallimawfrey and
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:101520:223"/>
Hotch-potch of Religions and Innovatours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they may put people upon Change. A Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
King ought with all his Power to defend the
Ancient Worſhip, nay, rather then know it: he is
juſtly counted, next under God, by whom his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
is vindicated: yet Faith is to be wrought by
Perſwaſion, not by Command.</p>
            <p>No leſs valiantly did the King avenge the affront offered
<hi>Crequi</hi> his Embaſſadour at <hi>Rome,</hi> then that done <hi>D'Eſtrade</hi>
at <hi>London.</hi> Contempt is a Peſtilent thing to Kingdoms,
whoſe Soul is Authority, and an honourable opinion of their
Soveraign. But contempt is a mean and low opinion of
the Prince and his State, imprinted in Subjects and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners,
by which the Majeſty of the Throne lyes on the
ground. For few overrhrows of States have been by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
the moſt by ſcorn. <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIV. hath vindicated
himſelf from that more then any of the Ancient, or more
modern Kings, who hath not ſpared ſo much as the Pope
himſelf.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Corſi,</hi> the Souldiers that are the Popes Guard, upon
pretence of ſome trivial quarrel with <hi>Crequi</hi>'s Pages, ſhoot
Piſtols in at his Windows, ſet upon his Wives Coach as ſhe
is coming home; and offer all ſorts of Inſolencies, tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling
upon the Holineſs of the Embaſſy. <hi>Crequi</hi> departed
from <hi>Rome</hi> unſatisfied; the <hi>Corſi</hi> triumph. The Ring of <hi>France</hi>
having taken into his power <hi>Avignon,</hi> a City of the Popes;
threatens to uſe extremity, and prepares an Army againſt
<hi>Italy:</hi> After divers Treaties, it is concluded at <hi>Piſa;</hi> That
<hi>for the appeaſing the Kings Wrath, the</hi> Corſi <hi>be eternally ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
from</hi> Rome! <hi>A Pyramide be built for an everlaſting
monument of the Action;</hi> but what is the principal matter,
That a <hi>Legate,</hi> à Latere <hi>be ſent to the King too in ſubmiſſive
terms, to give ſatisfaction for the hainouſneſs of the Fact;</hi>
which was decently performed by the Popes Nephew,
Cardinal <hi>Chighi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The State of <hi>France</hi> being in perfect ſettlement, the
King reverenced at home, and feared abroad; holds his
Eyes ſteady over all <hi>Europe,</hi> to bring ſpeedy relief to that
part, which he ſaw injured and in diſtreſs. Behold, of a
ſudden, the Tyrant of <hi>Aſia</hi> enters <hi>Hungaria.</hi> The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:101520:224"/>
               <hi>Leopoldus</hi> implores the <hi>French</hi> Succour: It is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
ſent under the command of <hi>Collins.</hi> Again, did the
double-nam'd <hi>Iſter</hi> admire the <hi>French</hi> Banners; they fight
ſtoutly againſt the <hi>Turk;</hi> and the King lending his ſtrength,
and his Fortune, a Peace is concluded, or a Truce like a
Peace. The Victorious Army at their return, ſhewed at
<hi>Paris</hi> their naked Semitars, taken from the <hi>Muſulmans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Merchandize is rendered conſiderable, ſtocks of Money
being provided for it. Our power is diffuſed through the
Weſt and Eaſtern Countries,the Sea being on all parts free
or linked in Commerce. Now as the management of every
publick Affair requires ſome aſſiſtant, the direction of this
great charge is committed by the King, to <hi>John Baptiſt Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hoſe private profit, whatſoever doth not turn to
the publick, he doth not think conducing, a perſon of a
deep reach. We ſee Rebellion chained, Luxury ſubdued,
the Robbers of the Publick Money confounded; all men,
either inclined by their Wills to do well, or neceſſitated by
the Laws. For a Prince by his actions, teaches his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to act righteouſly; and as he is greateſt in Power, ſo is
he yet greater in Example; and no body complains but
of his Greatneſs, who is the hope and Peace of People.</p>
            <trailer>Here ends the year 1664. and my Hiſtory, with the new
Apparition in the Sky; they call it a Comet; there is
none but deſires to know, whether he ſhould admire, or
fear it. Some there are who give out, that it portends ſome
grievous matter; we are of that temper, that we paſs over
with neglect, what we ſee every day, though worthy of
admiration; on the contrary, even the leaſt matters, if they
appear to us unuſual, we make a buſineſs of gazing upon
them.</trailer>
