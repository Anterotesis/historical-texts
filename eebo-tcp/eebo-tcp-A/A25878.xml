            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>How ſayeſt thou, <hi>Stephen Colledge,</hi> Art thou Guilty of this High-Treaſon whereof
thou ſtandeſt Indicted, and haſt been now Arraigned, or not Guilty?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I do deſire, if it pleaſe your Lordship, to be heard a few words.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Look you, Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> the matter that hath been here read unto you
is a plain matter, and it hath been read to you in <hi>English,</hi> that you may underſtand it.
'Tis an Indictment of High Treaſon; now you muſt know, that no Plea can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to it, but either Guilty or not Guilty as to the Fact; if you can aſſign any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in Law, do it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>Will you pleaſe to ſpare me, that I may be heard a few words. I have been
kept cloſe Priſoner in the Tower ever ſince I was taken: I was all along unacquainted
with what was charged upon me. I knew not what was ſworn againſt me, nor the perſons
that did ſwear it againſt me, and therefore I am wholly ignorant of the matter. I do
humbly deſire I may have a Copy of the Indictment, and a Copy of the Jury that is to paſs
upon me, and that I may have Council asſigned me, to adviſe me, whether I have not
ſomething in Law pleadable in Bar of this Indictment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lo. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Theſe are the things you ask, You would have a Copy of the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
you would have Council aſſigned to you, to adviſe you in matter of Law, and a
Copy of the Jury.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>One word more, my Lord, I deſire to know upon what Statute I am In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lo. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>I will tell you for that, Is it not <hi>contra formam Statut.</hi> with an abbre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation?
<hi>Cl. of Cr.</hi> Yes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lo. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>That refers to all manner of Statutes that have any relation to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31349:5"/>
thing in the Indictment that is High-Treaſon. For it may be meant <hi>contra formam
Statut.</hi> which are all the ſeveral Statutes that are in force concerning High-Treaſon.
Now for thoſe things that you demand, you cannot have them by Law. No man can
have a Copy of the Indictment by Law; for Councel, you cannot have it, unleſs mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Law ariſes, and that muſt be propounded by you; and then if it be a matter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batable,
the Court will aſſign you Councel, but it muſt be upon a matter fit to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued:
for I muſt tell you, a defence in Caſe of High-Treaſon ought not to be made by
Artificial Cavils, but by plain Fact. If you purpoſe any matter of Law, the Court will
conſider of it, and aſſign you Councel, if it be reaſonable. For a copy of the Jury,
that you can't have neither, for there is no ſuch thing as yet; there is no Iſſue joyned
whereupon ſuch a Jury should be impannelled. When you have pleaded to Iſſue, then
we muſt award the Sheriff to impannel a Jury to try that Iſſue. So as to what you ſay
as to want of preparation for your Tryal, we cannot enquire what notice you have
had; and yet if you had never ſo little time, there is no cauſe why you should not
plead, though you were but juſt now taken and brought to the Bar to anſwer it, and
never heard of any thing of it before. So that I think you ought to plead preſently.</p>

               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I am wholly ignorant of the Law, I may ruine my ſelf by miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Law; I deſire Councel, not to delay my Tryal, but only to adviſe me whether
there is not ſomething in Law proper for me to plead to this Indictment, and thoſe things
I alledged were not at all to delay the Tryal, but only that I may not be wanting to my
ſelf in what I may by Law have.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lo. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>I tell you, Councel cannot be aſſigned you till the Court be poſſeſſed of
ſome matter to grant it upon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>I had ſome Papers, my Lord, that were taken from me, which I deſire
may be reſtored to me. I only plead that I may have my Birth-right, and that which the
Law gives me; If I may have Juſtice, I deſire no more. Theſe Papers were taken
from me in the Houſe over the way ſince I was brought from the Priſon; they were Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
that concerned my defence; ſome directions and inſtructions how to manage my
ſelf in that defence. If you pleaſe to let me have thoſe Papers, I will not take up
much of your time; I deſire to have but common Juſtice, and that which is my right by
Law.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>That which you demand, Juſtice, you shall have by the Grace of God
to the beſt of our skill, without any partiality in the World. But you muſt truſt the
Publick Juſtice of the Kingdom. We are to be of Councel for you, ſo far as to ſee
that all things proceed fairly on all ſides. And when things come before us that are fit
for you to have Councel upon, you shall have Councel aſſigned you; for we are ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the life of a Man, as well as of the life of the King, and of the publick Juſtice of
the Kingdom. But this is no reaſon why you should not now plead. For the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
you ſpeak of, we will take an examination of them afterwards: If they were Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
that are neceſſary for your defence upon your Tryal, in God's Name you muſt
have them reſtored to you; but we know not which way you came by them, nor what
they are.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I know not but there may be ſomething in Law for me to plead to this
Indictment, which I ſhall loſe the benefit of if I plead. I humbly conceive you are to be my
Councel, and as you are Judges, are to proceed according to the Law. You are upon your

               <p>If I had thoſe Papers, I could tell what I should plead. My Lord, this is

nor could any be of Councel till they were aſſigned: for a defence againſt Treaſon
ought to be by plain matters of Proof and Fact, and not by artificial Cavils. But if you
will propoſe any thing of ſubſtance, as a matter in Law which the Court shall think fit

by Law to challenge 35. by your ſight premptorily, without shewing cauſe.
They are bound to look upon you when they come to be ſworn, and if you
have any juſt cauſe, you may except againſt as many more as as you will. But now we
that proceed upon a Commiſſion of Gaol-delivery, are to proceed with expedition;
there are no particular men deſigned for a Jury that I know of. But when you have
pleaded, we shall award the Sheriff to impannel a Jury.</p>

of him by the Court, if he refuſes, let him take the conſequence of it.</p>

               <p>Judgment of High-Treaſon. For if a perſon ſtand mute, and will
not plead to an Indictment of High-Treaſon, the common Judgment of Preſſing to
Death muſt not paſs upon him, but an Attainder of High-Treaſon.</p>

               <p>My Lord, it has not been uſual for us that are of the Kings counſel,
to enter into Dialogues with Priſoners at the Bar. The firſt thing that is to be done in
ſuch caſes, is for the Priſoner to Plead Guilty, or not Guilty or to offer ſomething
to the Court that may be a matter in Law fit to be debated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this we pray may be
done in this caſe, and that the Priſoner may plead preſently, or elſe we deſire your

               <p>You go in a circle, and run round from one thing to another, and will

you hold long Diſcourſes, yet you will be judged loſt and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Plea. Therefore you muſt plead Guilty, or not Guilty, or offer ſomething that may
be a Plea in Law, and then you shall have the aſſiſtance of councel, but you muſt have
none till then.</p>

               <p>Whether they are material or not material, if we should judge them not
material for his defence, yet it will look like an hard point upon the Priſoner, and to
deliver them into an hand that they may be carried away or ſtifled, in caſe there were a
crime in the delivering of them that would not do well on the other ſide: therefore I
would have theſe papers put into ſome ſafe hands, that what may be for the Priſoners

               <p>This no man will oppoſe ſure, if any thing that is delivered to him
be fit to be delivered, the perſon that delivers it muſt come and own it; but before
any perſon delivers any papers to the Priſoner, for him to make uſe of againſt the Kings
Evidence, we deſire to know what thoſe papers mean, and who gave them.</p>

               <p>Look you Brother, we will have nothing of heat till the Tryal be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
when that is over if there be any thing that requires our Examination it will be
proper for us to enter into the conſideration of it. But in the mean while what hurt
is there, if the papers be put into ſome truſty hands, that the Priſoner may make the
beſt uſe of them he can, and yet they remain ready to be produced upon occaſion, if a
man be ſpeaking for his Life, though he ſpeak that which is not material, or nothing
to the purpoſe, that will be no harm to permit that.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, you of the Jury, look upon the Priſoner, and hearken to his
Charge. He ſtands Indicted by the name of <hi>Stephen Colledge,</hi> late of <hi>Oxford,</hi> in the
County of <hi>Oxford,</hi> Carpenter; for that he as a falſe Traytor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> proved in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment,
<hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> and upon this Indictment he hath been Arraigned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>North.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordship, and you Gentlemen that are Sworn, this
is an Indictment againſt <hi>Stephen Colledge,</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar, for an endeavour to
raiſe a Rebellion within this Kingdom wherein he is accuſed, and the Jury find that he
as a falſe Traytor againſt the Kings Majeſty, contrary to the duty of his Allegiance,
on the <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> in the <hi>33d.</hi> year of the Kings Reign, at <hi>Oxon.</hi> here did tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly
conſpire, and compaſs the death of the King, and the Subverſion of the
Government, and to raiſe a Rebellion in the Kingdom, and to ſlaughter his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Subjects, to put the King to death, to levy War againſt him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to deprive
him of his Royal State and Government, and to alter the Government at his own
Will and Pleaſure; and to accomplish this, he did at <hi>Oxon.</hi> here prepare Arms for the
carrying on the War, and excited one <hi>Edward Turbervile</hi> and others, to arm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
againſt the accomplishment of this Deſign, and did declare his purpoſe was to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:31349:14"/>
ſeiſe the Kings perſon at <hi>Oxon.</hi> and that he was one of thoſe that was to do it; and
to bring the ſaid <hi>Turbervile</hi> and other Subjects to his purpoſe, did falſly, malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
and traiterouſly declare in their Hearing, that there was no good to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from the King, that he minded nothing but the Deſtruction of his people, and
Arbitrary Government, and to introduce Popery. And this is laid to be againſt the
Duty of his Allegiance, againſt the Kings peace, and againſt the form of the Statutes
in thoſe caſes made and provided. The Priſoner you hear upon his Arraignment
hath pleaded Not guilty, which Iſſue you are to try, and if the Evidence for the
King, which are ready to be produced, prove that which is laid to his charge, you are
to find it accordingly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury. The
Priſoner at the Bar ſtands indicted of a very high crime, no leſs then High Treaſon,
and that too of the deepeſt dye; it is for an Endeavour to deſtroy the King, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the Government, to raiſe a Rebellion amongſt the Kings Subjects. And Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
thoſe Inſtances that we shall give you, and produce our Evidence to for the
proof of that, are theſe. He laid his Deſign to ſeiſe the King at <hi>Oxon.</hi> and he did not
want his Accomplices to do it, but they were not men, Gentlemen, that were Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
but men that were Rebels in the late War, they were men of ſuch a kidney, that
he aſſociated himſelf with, and theſe were the perſons that were to aſſiſt in this At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
In order to this he had prepared Arms in an extraordinary manner, Arms of
a great value for one of his condition, who is by Trade a Joyner; for if a true eſtimate
were taken of the value of the Arms; I believe they were worth twice his whole Eſtate;
he prepared a good Horſe, extraordinary Piſtols, a Carbine, a Coat of Maile, an Head-piece,
and ſo being armed Cap-a-pee, with that deſign he came hither to <hi>Oxon.</hi> And
you will judge whether theſe be fit Tools for a Joyner.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, theſe were the particulars I was opening to you, in what
manner he was armed, and how accoutred he came hither. We shall likewiſe shew
you that he made it his buſineſs to perſwade others to undertake the Deſign, and
joyn with him, and as if open War were already declared; he gave out a ſign, which
was a blue Ribbon, a wrought Ribbon with letters in it, and this was the mark and ſign
they were to know one another by. This was given out by him frequently; and that it
may not ſeem an extraordinary thing, Gentlemen, though indeed it was a wild atempt,
yet you will ceaſe to wonder when you have heard of the exploit of <hi>Venner,</hi> who with
a few men raiſed ſuch a commotion ſoon after the Kings coming in, and the ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits
that have of late in <hi>Scotland</hi> been carried on by a few diſcontented perſons. So
that men of the like Principles, as we shall give you an account of this Gentlemans
Principles what they were, may well be thought to ingage in ſuch an extraordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit.
And we shall prove what the incouragement was he was to have; for he boaſted
of himſelf, that he should be in a little time a Collonel.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>A Collonel, a great preferment for a Joyner.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, it was ſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>We shall shew to you that this was not a ſudden unpremeditated thing:
for we shall prove that he had entertained the horridſt malice againſt the King that ever
Subject entertained againſt his Sovereign: For we shall give this evidence, and his
Front will not oppoſe it, that he had made it his common diſcourſe in Coffee-Houſes,
and publick Houſes, (and I believe I could bring you 40 and 40 Witneſſes to it) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame
the King, and murder him in his Reputation, and was one of the Complices with
<hi>Fitz Harris,</hi> who lately was executed for that venomous Libel: We shall prove that
he juſtified it, and maintained it to be as true as the Goſpel. We shall give evidence
that he carried on the ſame deſign with that Arch-Traytor who was a Papiſt; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
if this Gentleman were examined throughly, he would be found to be one of the
ſame Stamp, and acted by the ſame Principle; for I think that no Proteſtant Subject
would attempt ſuch things as we shall prove to you. I believe, Gentlemen, you have
frequently heard, as none of us but have, that the King hath been traduced as a Deſigner
of Arbitrary Government, and his Reputation blaſted maliciouſly, and falſly, as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducer
of Popery: Whence comes all this generally, but out of the Popish Quiver,
who make it their buſineſs to ſet the Kings good Subjects at variance amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
and againſt their Prince, by ſtyling the King a Papiſt, as this perſon hath done;
nay, he hath been ſo impudent as to report that the King was in the Plot againſt his own
life. We shall prove to you, how here and at other places he hath frequently done
this. To go further, we shall produce to you the evidence that he drew the King's
Picture, and expoſed him in all the reproachful characters imaginable; and that the
Picture might be the better underſtood, he adds a Ballad to it: And that he may not
have the confidence to ſay this is not true, we shall produce to you a whole bundle of
theſe papers, among thoſe which his Son made a diſcovery of, when they were ſent to

this man should have the confidence to ſay he is a good Subject and a good Proteſtant,
when by all ways imaginable he goes about to ruin the Government, and defame the
King! And Gentlemen when we have given you this account by Witneſſes, for I
would have you believe me in nothing, but according as I prove it, you will not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
then that he should ſay his Life is in danger, (for ſo it is indeed.) And if any man

he hath been mightily bent againſt Popery; he hath at ſometimes uttered himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the King did not proſecute the Papiſts according as he thought ſufficiently, that
the King was a Papiſt himſelf, that he was as deep in the Plot as any Papiſt of them all,
that he had an Hand in Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfry's</hi> Death. This Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> I appeal to

               <p>It was his common word concerning the King. And at other times
ſpeaking that the King did not do thoſe things that were fair, he hath given mighty great
words againſt him: He hath told me that there was no truſt to be put in him; for it was
the People we muſt truſt to, and we muſt look to arm our ſelves, and that he would arm
himſelf, and be here at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and he told me here in the Town accordingly, when I
came out of the Countrey, and he ſaid that he had ſeveral ſtout men that would ſtand
by him in it. Their intention was, as he ſaid, for the rooting out of Popery, by which
name he always termed the Church that is now eſtablished by Law, as to be of the ſame
nature the Papiſts were. This I believe <hi>Mr. Colledge</hi> will acknowledge.</p>

by, that it would be the beſt way, out of every County, where the Parliament had the

Evidence now, he tells you a ſeries of what paſſed between <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Oxford;</hi> and I
muſt tell you further, if a Treaſon be committed, and the Evidence prove it to be in
two Countries, the King may chooſe which County he will proſecute and bring his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
in, and give in Evidence the Facts in both Counties. But you shall have your
Objection to it afterwards, and we will take it into conſideration. I tell you this, that
it may not ſeem to you that the Witneſſes ſpeak impertinently of what was done at
<hi>London;</hi> but if nothing was done or ſaid at <hi>Oxford,</hi> then it will be taken into conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
you shall have it ſaved afterwards, I only him it now, that you may not think it
impertinent.</p>

               <p>I beſeech your Lordship give me leave to ſpeak one word; When he made his
Affidavit before Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins</hi> there about ſeizing the King, about the party I had,
and the Arms I had provided, ought not he at the ſame time to have ſaid where I ſaid
thoſe words to him? but he did ſwear then it was in <hi>London</hi> that I ſaid thoſe words to
him; and coming before a Grand Jury of honeſt Gentlemen in <hi>London,</hi> they were ſo
wiſe and honeſt as to do me Juſtice, and not find the Bill; ſo their deſign failing there,
then they changed it to <hi>Oxford.</hi>

               <p>You did not come to your Tryal there, if you had ſo done, then they would
have asked him in particular what was ſaid at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and what at <hi>London,</hi> as 'tis now,
being done in both Counties. But look you, if you will ask any particular queſtions,
do, for they have other Witneſſes to produce.</p>

               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I only ask this queſtion, Whether it be not rational to think, that
when he ſwore before Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins,</hi> he should not ſwear the words were ſpoken,
and things done?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sewell.</speaker>
               <p>I had a Warrant to ſeize Mr. <hi>Spur,</hi> and his Brother-in-law, Mr. <hi>Colledge.</hi>
So I went down to ſeize <hi>Mr. Spur,</hi> and ſearch his Houſe for ſuch papers as I should find.
I could not find them in the Houſe; but I enquired of him, after I had ſearched, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:31349:22"/>
could not find them where they were; becauſe I ſaw him at Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi>'s when we
firſt ſearched; he denied them a pretty while, but at laſt he told me they were in the
Hay-mow in the Barn. When I came there, he was balling, and told me his Wife,
<hi>Colledge</hi>'s Siſter had taken them down, and carried them into a room where <hi>I</hi> had
ſearched before, but could not find them; and the man was angry then, ſo we run after
his Wife, and found her with all theſe papers in a bag.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ser. jeff.</speaker>
               <p>Give us an account what dealings you have had with him, where, and
when; what he hath ſaid about the King; and tell us firſt whether you be intimately
acquainted?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Smith.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>We were intimately acquainted. The firſt time I heard Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi>
diſcourſing any thing of this nature, that is, concerning Treaſon, or any ſuch thing,
was once at a Coffee-Houſe by <hi>Temple-Bar;</hi> there I met <hi>Colledge,</hi> and he told me he
was invited to Dinner, and he likewiſe invited me to it. I asked him who provided
the Dinner, he told me it was one Alderman <hi>VVilcox;</hi> I told him I was a ſtranger, and
did not care for going: He told me I should be very welcome there, and at laſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
upon me to go: And as I was going along, I asked him what the Alderman
was? He told me he was a man that was as true as ſteel, and a man that would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to root out Popery: Said I, that may be done eaſily, if you can but prevail
with the King to paſs the Bill againſt the D. of <hi>York.</hi> No, no, ſaid he, you are miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
for <hi>Rowley</hi> is as great a Papiſt as the D. of <hi>York</hi> is <hi>(now he called the King</hi> Rowley)
and every way as dangerous to the Proteſtant Intereſt, as is too apparent by his Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Ruling. This was the diſcourſe between the Coffee-Houſe and the Tavern
where we went to dine. When we came in, I asked <hi>Colledge</hi> again, whether the Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was there; he ſaid he was not there at that time: I asked him the ſecond time
what kind of man he was, he ſaid he was one that lived in his Countrey-Houſe, and
gave freely to ſeveral people to buy Arms and Ammunition. And I asked him to what
purpoſe? and he ſaid it was to bring the King to ſubmiſſion to his people; adding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
that he wondred <hi>Old Rowley</hi> did not conſider how eaſily his Fathers Head came to
the Block, which he doubted not would be the end of <hi>Rowley</hi> at the laſt. After this
diſcourſe the Alderman came in; we dined, and every one went his own way about
his own buſineſs. Mr. <hi>Colledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> then told me, if I would go with him to his own
Houſe, I should ſee how he was prepared with Arms and Proviſion. Soon after I met
with him, and he deſired me to go along and dine with him; and I did ſo, and there
he did shew me his Piſtols, his Blunderbuſs, his great Sword; and he shewed me
his Armour, Back and Breaſt; and he shewed me his Head-piece, which, if I am
not miſtaken, was covered over with Chamlet, it was a very fine thing; and, ſaid he,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:31349:23"/>
Theſe are the things which will deſtroy the pitiful Guards of <hi>Rowley,</hi> that are kept up
contrary to Law and Juſtice, to ſet up Arbitrary Power and Popery.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>What did I ſay, Sir, about my Armour?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Smith.</speaker>
               <p>Thus you ſaid; It was to deſtroy <hi>Rowley</hi>'s Guards (thoſe were your
words) that were kept up contrary to Law and Juſtice, to ſet up Arbitrary Power and
Popery. After I had dined with him, I parted with him. A little before the Parliament
was to meet at <hi>Oxford,</hi> I met him again; and were diſcourſing of ſeveral things,
what preparations the City were making, how they were provided with Powder and
Bullets; and for his part, he would go down to <hi>Oxford,</hi> for he expected a little ſport
there, upon the diviſions that were like to be between the King and Parliament. Then
ſaid I to him, why, what is the matter there? Why, ſaid he, we expect that the King
will ſeize upon ſome of the members, and we are as ready as he. And, ſays he, for my
part, I will be there, and be one that shall ſeize him, if he ſecure any of the members,
(and I believe he did go down;) ſays he, you know how the City is provided: I told
him, no, not ſo well as he; but he told me all was very well. After he came up again,
I met him another time, and he told me, he went down in expectation of ſome ſport;
but <hi>Old Rowley</hi> was afraid, like his Grand-father <hi>Jamy,</hi> and ſo ran away like to beshit
himſelf.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Ser. jeff.</speaker>
               <p>Did he ſay, If he had not ran away, he would have ſeized him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Smith.</speaker>
               <p>He ſaid nothing of that, but before, he ſaid, He would be one of them
should ſeize him, if he ſeized any of the members. After this he told me, that <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi>
and he had had a quarrel at the Parliament-door of the Houſe of Lords at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;</hi>
that <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> had called him Rogue; and, ſaid he, <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> made my
Noſe bleed; but before long, I hope to ſee a great deal more Blood shed for the cauſe.
After this again, when there was a diſcourſe of diſarming the City, that my Lord <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſham</hi>
was to come to do it, he told me, he was well provided, and if <hi>Feversham,</hi> or
any man, nay <hi>Rowley</hi> himſelf should attempt any ſuch thing, he would be the death of
him, before any man should ſeize upon his Arms.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Smith.</speaker>
               <p>He did deſire me to get Arms, for I did not know how ſoon I might
make uſe of them. I had an Armour from him upon trial; he ſaid it coſt him 30 or
<hi>40 s.</hi> I had it upon trial, but it was too big for me, ſo I gave it him back, and bought a
new one.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>He told me the Parliament were agreed to ſecure the King, and that in
order to it, all Parliament-men came very well armed, and accompanied with arms and
men; and he told me of a great man that had notice from all the Gentlemen of <hi>England</hi>
how well they came armed.</p>

               <p>Yes and that is a good Ordination: I came in voluntarily to diſcover
the Popish Plot, and was no Pentioner, nor received any Sallary from the King. I have
ſpent ſeveral pounds, ſeveral ſcores of pounds, but received no recompence. And I
was the Darling at one time all over the City, when I did adhere to what they would

with him ever ſince <hi>March</hi> laſt, before the ſitting of the Parliament at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
My Lord, there was a Warrant againſt me for High Treaſon; and I made my appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> and deſired him to go to a certain Perſon of Honour in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and ask his advice, whether I might ſupercede the Warrant by putting in Bayl,
and carry the <hi>Supercedeas</hi> in my pocket: <hi>Mr. Colledge</hi> told me he would go to this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of Honour, for he would do nothing of his own head; and he bid me come to him
the next day. My Lord, <hi>I</hi> came to Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> the very next day, and I met him
at his Houſe, and I asked him what was the reſult, and what advice he had from that
perſon of Quality; he bid me be of good chear, that the Parliament would be, and
ſit at <hi>Oxford</hi> ſoon; that I should not value the King a pin; for, ſaid he, the King is in
a worſe condition than you or I; for you shall ſee, ſaid he, he shall be called to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for all his Actions.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Haynes.</speaker>
               <p>The King; for all the world may ſee, ſays he, that he does reſolve to
bring in Arbitrary Power and Popery: And, ſaid he, unleſs he will let the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſit at <hi>Oxford,</hi> ſince he hath called them together, and put the people to charges in
chuſing of them, and them in coming down, we will ſeize him at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and bring
him to the Block, as we did the Logger-head his Father. The Parliament shall ſit at
<hi>Guildhall,</hi> and adjuſt the Grievances of the Subject, and of the Nation. And you shall

               <p>But, Sir, ſaid I to Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> how can this be done, 'tis a thing impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.
You pretend, you ſay, to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> that he is a fine Prince, and
ſtands up for the Proteſtant Intereſt: Alas, ſaid he, we make an Idol of him to
adumbrate our Actions, for fear we should be diſcovered. Do you think the wiſe
people of <hi>England</hi> shall ever make a Baſtard upon Record King of <hi>England:</hi> No,
ſaid he, for though we praiſe his Actions, yet we cannot endure him, becauſe he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his own Father. But, ſaid he, further, unleſs the King do expel from his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
the Earl of <hi>Clarindon,</hi> cunning <hi>Lory Hide,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Hallifax,</hi> that great Turn-coat
Rogue, that was before ſo much againſt the Papiſts, a Raſcal, we shall ſee him
hang'd, and all the <hi>Tory</hi> Counſellors; except the King do it, we will make <hi>England</hi>
too hot for him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>Who did I ſay this to, to you?</p>

               <speaker>Haynes.</speaker>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, how could this be posſible?</p>

            <sp>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:31349:25"/>
               <speaker>Haynes.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, you knew my condition; and I intimated to you at that time, That
I was as much for Treaſon and Villany as you: But then ſaid I to him, how can
this be done? Here you have neither Officers, nor men of experience, nor men of
knowledge; nor you have no Ammunition, Sea-port Towns, nor Ships. And
beſides, the King, ſaid I, hath a great party in the Land, and the Duke of <hi>York</hi>
likewiſe; and for all the men of Eſtates, and the ancient Gentlemen, they will not
be diſturbed, and to quit their Eaſe for a civil War. Oh, ſays he, you are miſtaken,
for we have in the City 1500 Barrels of Powder, and we have 100000 men ready
at an hours warning; and we have ordered every thing in a due method againſt the
ſitting of the Parliament at <hi>Oxford;</hi> and you shall ſee <hi>England</hi> the moſt glorious
Nation in the World, when we have cut off that beaſtly Fellow <hi>Rowley;</hi> and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the King, he ſaid, He came of the Race of Buggerers, for his Grandfather,
King <hi>James,</hi> buggered the old Duke of <hi>Buckingham;</hi> and he called him <hi>Captain,</hi>
and ſometimes the <hi>King,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Rowley.</hi>

               </speaker>
               <p>This was pure Proteſtant diſcourſe upon my word.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Haynes.</speaker>
               <p>Then he railed at Judge <hi>Pemberton;</hi> and, ſaid he, let him try <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>
if he dare; I shall ſee him go to <hi>Tyburn</hi> for it, I hope, a Turn-coat Rogue. He was
for the Plot whilſt he was a <hi>puiſne</hi> Judge, but now he is Chief Juſtice, he is the greateſt
Rogue in the world. He is like one of the Penſioners in the long Parliament. So
one day I went along with Mrs. <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Ivy,</hi> and he ſent a man to me,
and deſired me to come to the Hog in Armor; thither we came, and met him, and
went to his Lodgings, and there we dined. Then they made ſome perſons of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
believe, that I was a perſon ſo and ſo qualified, and was brim full of the Plot;
and he would put me upon charging the King with the firing of <hi>London,</hi> and the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi> and ſaid he, ſuch and ſuch Lords shall live and die
by you; and beſides, ſaid he, you need not fear, <hi>England</hi> shall eſpouſe your Cauſe.
But, ſaid I, the Law is like the Spiders Web, that catches the little Flies, but the great
Flies run through the Net, and make their eſcape; ſo 'tis with theſe Lords, they put
you and me on the danger of acting; and when they get off by intereſt, a Jury of
Twelve men will hang us by the Neck, and ſo I should perish, whilſt others triumphed,
and only be a martyr for the Phanaticks. So in diſcourſe we were talking of the Libel
of <hi>Fitz-Harris;</hi> The Devil take me, ſaid he, every individual word is as true as God
is in Heaven; and ſaid he, if you do not joyn with <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> in his Evidence, and
charge the King home, you are the baſeſt fellow in the world, for he makes you ſlaves
and beggars, and would make all the world ſo; and 'tis a kind of charity to charge
him home, that we may be rid of ſuch a Tyrant.</p>

               <p>Oh, no, my Lord. One and I fell out at the <hi>Queens-Head</hi> Tavern at
<hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> and he ſet me upon the buſineſs, and <hi>John Macnamarra</hi> and others, and
truly I did the buſineſs for him: For we fell out, and did box, and our Swords were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from us, and I went to <hi>John Macnamarra,</hi> and told him, yonder is ſuch a man at
ſuch a place, now you may ſeize upon him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Haynes.</speaker>
               <p>But, my Lord, further, after he came from <hi>Oxon.</hi> I met him, and ſaid I,
Where are now all your cracks and brags? now you ſee the King hath made a fool of
you; now you know not what you would have done. Says he, what would you have us
do? We have not done with him yet: For, ſaid he, no ſervant, no man living did
know whether he would Diſſolve the Parliament that day. I was that very nick of
time at the <hi>Lobby</hi> of the Lords-Houſe, and there was a man came in with a Gown
under his arm, and every one looked upon him to be a Taylor, and no body did ſuſpect,
no, not his intimateſt Friends, except it were <hi>Fitz-Gerald,</hi> that he would Diſſolve the
Parliament that day; but preſently he puts on his Robes, and ſends away for the Houſe
of Commons; and when he had Diſſolved them, before ever the Houſe could get
down, he took Coach and went away, otherwiſe the Parliament had been too hard for
him; for there was never a Parliament-man but had divers armed men to wait on him,
and I had my Blunderbuſs and my man to wait upon me. But well, ſaid he, there is
a God above will rule all.</p>

was afterwards to ſit. And then, to give you a more particular circumſtance, he ſays
that you put him upon the making of the Affidavit about <hi>Fitz-Gerald,</hi> and ſo you came

After Dinner <hi>Don Lewes</hi> went out about his own buſineſs, and Captain <hi>Brown</hi> went
to ſleep; <hi>Mr. Colledge</hi> and I fell talking of the Times, and I was obſerving, I thought
the Parliament was not a long lived Parliament. Said he, there is no good to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from the King; for he and all his Family are Papiſts, and have ever been ſuch,
you know it, Sir.</p>

will ſecure him till we have thoſe terms that we expect from him.</p>

this Parliament was no long-lived Parliament. Upon which <hi>Colledge</hi> told me the

<hi>London</hi> would not find the Bill; I did admire at it extremely; for I thought every one
that converſed with him might be an Evidence againſt him; he was always ſo very la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
againſt the King and the Government. So then Colonel <hi>Warcupp</hi> came to me,
and took my Depoſitions, and then I came for <hi>Oxford.</hi>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> and I have been acquainted for a great many years;
and we have often diſcourſed. I have told him of his being ſo violent as he hath been
ſeveral times. But a little before the Parliament at <hi>Oxon.</hi> about <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> laſt, after
the Parliament at <hi>VVeſtminſter,</hi> at Mr. <hi>Charlton</hi>'s Shop the Woollen-Draper in <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Church-yard, we were diſcourſing together about the Government, and he was juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of the late long Parliaments Actions in 40; and he ſaid, That Parliament was
as good a Parliament as ever was choſen in the Nation. Said <hi>I,</hi> I wonder how you have
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:31349:28"/>
the impudence to juſtify their Proceedings, that raiſed the Rebellion againſt the King,
and cut off his Head. Said he, they did nothing but what they had juſt cauſe for, and
the Parliament that ſate laſt at <hi>VVeſtminſter</hi> was of their opinion, and ſo you would have

               <p>My Lord, the firſt time that I heard any thing of Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
was, there was ſome company looking upon a Picture, for I knew him not, nor
never had any word of diſcourſe with him in my life, any more then ſeeing him in a
publick Coffee-Houſe. But there was a Picture looking on by 7 or 8 or 10 people, I
believe, more or leſs, and I coming and crowding in my Head amongſt the reſt, looked
upon this Picture. After the crowd was over, <hi>Mr. Colledge</hi> takes a Picture out of his
Pocket; and, ſaid he, <hi>I</hi> will give you one of them, if you will. So he gives me a
Picture; which Picture, if <hi>I</hi> could ſee, <hi>I</hi> could tell what it was; it was written <hi>Mac</hi> a
top, and there were ſeveral Figures in it.</p>
               <stage>(Then the Picture was shewed him.)</stage>
               <p>This is one of the ſame that <hi>I</hi> had of him, and <hi>I</hi> had not had it long in my cuſtody,
but meeting with Juſtice <hi>VVarcupp, I</hi> shewed it him, who bid me give it him, and ſo <hi>I</hi>
did. The next thing <hi>I</hi> did ſee Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> do, that was in the coffee-houſe, not the
ſame day, but another time: <hi>I</hi> ſaw him bring in a parcel of blue Ribband which was
wrought, and theſe words eight times wrought in it, twice wrought in every quarter of
a yard, <hi>No Popery, no Slavery.</hi> I ſaw him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>l to a member of Parliament, as I took
him to be, a yard of that Ribband for <hi>2 s.</hi> and truly I was thinking he would ask me
to but ſome too, and I ſaw that Gentleman (I took him to be a Parliament-man) take
this Ribband and tye it upon his Sword. As to the other thing I have to ſay of Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
that very day the Parliament was diſſolved he had been in a quarrel, as he told me,
with <hi>Fitz-Gerald,</hi> and <hi>I</hi> was ſtanding in the School-Houſe yard, and he comes directly
to me without my ſpeaking to him or any thing; but he comes and tells me <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi>
had ſpit in his face, and, ſaid he, I ſpit in his face again; ſo we went to loggerheads toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:31349:29"/>
I think that was the word, or Fiſty-cuffs. So, ſaid I, Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> your Noſe
bleeds; he takes his Handkerchief out of his Pocket and wipes his Noſe, and ſaid, I
have loſt the firſt Blood in the Cauſe, but it will not be long before more be loſt.</p>

               <p>In the School-houſe Yard at <hi>Oxon.</hi> I never diſcourſed with
him afterwards till I met him in <hi>London</hi> in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet</hi> one Sunday in the afternoon, and
I remember Captain <hi>Creſcett</hi> was along with me. And when he came up to me, How
now, ſaid I, honeſt Joyner? Says he, you call me honeſt Joyner, ſome call me Rogue
and Raſcal, and I have been beating ſome of them; ſo that I believe they will be
aware of it. So I told Captain <hi>Creſcett</hi> I never met this man but he was always in
a Quarrel.</p>

               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>I remember I met you, but I did not tell you I had been then beating any
one. But pray, Sir <hi>William,</hi> when I met you after the Parliament was Diſſolved, and
<hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> and I had quarrell'd, did I ſay, That I had loſt the firſt blood in the Cauſe,
but it would not be long e're more were loſt. Sir <hi>William,</hi> you are a Gentleman; as for
the other men, they don't care what they ſay, nor do I ſo much regard them; but you va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
your Word and Honour. Theſe were my words, and pray will you recollect your ſelf
before you be poſitive in the thing, whether I did not ſay, I have loſt the firſt blood for the
Parliament, (for it was upon my vindicating of the Commons, and Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> whom
<hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> had abuſed; and upon that the Quarrel began; ſo I ſaid, when you met
me, and told me my Noſe bled, I have loſt the firſt blood for the Parliament) I wish it
may be the laſt.</p>

it before, and do declare it now, I would rather have ſerved the King in three En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements,
then come in againſt you, or any man, upon ſuch an occaſion. But <hi>I</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
to you, upon the whole memory of the truth, the words were as <hi>I</hi> ſpoke them at
firſt, and no Parliament named or mentioned. And, my Lord, moreover, <hi>I</hi> will tell
you, when <hi>I</hi> did tell this ſtory, becauſe Mr. <hi>Creſcett</hi> that is here, is able to tell you
whether <hi>I</hi> did not relate the words within half an hour, or a little time after. Now <hi>I</hi>

<hi>I</hi> related them to Juſtice <hi>VVarcupp,</hi> he being a Juſtice of Peace.</p>

shall explain the words to you that are in the Indictment, and tell you what is meant
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:31349:29"/>
by compaſſing and imagining the death of the King. The ſeizing the perſon of the
King, is in Law a compaſſing and intending his death; and ſo it hath been adjudged in
ſeveral caſes, as in <hi>1 Jacob,</hi> my Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> and my Lord <hi>Grey</hi>'s caſe, and ſeveral
other caſes; and ſo you may fully apprehend what the Charge is, and may underſtand
the words in the Indictment, That if you are not ſatisfied with the general words of
compaſſing the Kings death, you may know, that the ſeizing his perſon extends to it</p>

your Witneſſes that you have to produce.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I have heard this Evidence that is againſt me, and I would deſire
your Lordship to reſolve me ſome Queſtions upon it; I think the Indictment, is for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
practices, for a Conſpiracy; now I deſire your Lordship will be pleaſed that I
may know from you, and the Court, whether in all this Evidence given in proof againſt
me, a Conſpiracy is proved; or if any thing appears beſides what they ſay I ſaid?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. c. j.</speaker>
               <p>For a conſpiracy in you, if the Witneſſes ſpeak truth, there is a plain proof,
and of the degrees of it: Firſt of all, by your publishing Libels and Pictures to make
the King odious and contemptible in the eyes of the people, and that you should be the
Author of ſome of thoſe Pictures, and they were found in your cuſtody.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>I conceive that is not proved.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lo. ch. juſt.</speaker>
               <p>If the Witneſſes ſay true, it is proved.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>They do not produce that, they do but ſay it.</p>

               <speaker>Lo. ch. juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſwears, that at <hi>Oxford</hi> here, you shew'd him the Picture,
you ſung the Song here, and expounded it at my Lord <hi>Lovelace</hi>'s, and a great many
of them are found in your cuſtody. Then that you prepared Arms, that you shew'd
<hi>Smith</hi> the Arms in your Houſe, and having thoſe Arms, you ſaid you would go to <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
and if there should be a diſturbance there, you would ſecure the King. And you
did come to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where you hear what is ſaid; for I obſerve, <hi>Stephen Dugdale</hi>
and <hi>Edward Turbervile</hi> ſpeak of what was done at <hi>Oxford. John Smith</hi> and <hi>Bryan
Haynes</hi> ſpeak of what you ſaid at <hi>London</hi> before you went to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and after you came
from <hi>Oxford.</hi> Now I ſay, if theſe Witneſſes ſpeak true, 'tis a ſtrong Evidence againſt
you, both upon the Statute of the <hi>25 Edw.</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> and that of this King too. For my
Brother <hi>Holloway</hi> told you true, That whereas the Imagining the death of the King is
High Treaſon, by the 25 of <hi>Edw.</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> ſo a ſeizing of the King, and an endeavour
to do that, is a conſtructive intention of the death of the King; for Kings are never
Priſoners, but in order to their death. And therefore it hath been held in all times,
that by the Statute of <hi>Edw. 3d.</hi> that was Treaſon; but then the Statute of this King,
in the <hi>13th.</hi> year of his Reign, is more ſtrong; for there it ſays, If any man shall by any
words, or malicious ſpeaking, shew the imagination of his heart, that he hath any ſuch
intention, that is Treaſon too.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, the Foundation of this Indictment is ſaid to be laid here in <hi>Oxford,</hi> as
I ſuppoſe; pray, my Lord, here is only Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> and <hi>Turbervile</hi> that ſwear againſt
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:31349:30"/>
me for what I ſhould ſay in Oxon. all the reſt ſpeak to things ſaid and done at <hi>London.</hi>
Now, my Lord, I deſire to know, whether they have proved any Treaſonable Practices,
Conſpiracy or Deſign againſt the Government, I would feign know that, whether there
be matter here to ground an Indictment upon; for the one ſays in one place, the other
in the other, which may be diſtinct matters, and none of them ſwear Facts againſt me,
but only Words.</p>

which every Footman and Horſeman had, that came from <hi>London,</hi> I think. But further
my Lord, I would ask your Lordſhip, whether there ought not to be Witneſſesdiſtinct, to
ſwear words at one and the ſame time.</p>

               <p>No, no, the Reſolution of the Judges in my Lord <hi>Staffords</hi> caſe is

               <p>Look you, it hath been often reſolved, that if there be one Witneſs
that proves one Fact which is an Evidence of Treaſon, and another proves another
Fact, that is an Evidence of the ſame Treaſon, though they be but ſingle Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to ſeveral Facts. yet they are two Witneſſes to an Indictment of Treaſon; that
hath been often publickly reſolved, particularly in the caſe of my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by my Brother. And I'le tell you my Opinion further, if there be one Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that proves here what you ſaid at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and another that proves what was ſaid
in <hi>London,</hi> if they be in order to the ſame Treaſon, it is ſufficient; for if you do conſpire
to commit ſuch a Treaſon in <hi>London,</hi> and you come with ſuch an imagination in your
Heart to <hi>Oxford</hi> to compleat this Treaſon, tho your Deſign was not firſt formed
there, I think 'tis enough to maintain an Indictment of Treaſon, and they are two good
Witneſſes, though but one ſpeak to what was done at <hi>Oxford,</hi> but I muſt tell you, in
your caſe there are two full Witneſſes to that which was done at <hi>Oxford,</hi> beſides Sir
<hi>William Jennings.</hi>

               <p>The Parliament was diſſolved before that which Sir <hi>William Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi>

was by, <hi>I</hi> do think, indeed it were convenient to have him here; but <hi>I</hi> knew not where

               <p>Then, my Lord, I would ask you, whether, any Act of Treaſon done at
<hi>London,</hi> ſhall be given in Evidence to prove the Treaſon for which I am now indicted,
and which was given in Evidence before the Grand Jury, upon which the Tryal was there
grounded.</p>

was reſolved in Sir <hi>Henry Vanes</hi> caſe; thoſe that gave you that paper underſtand it.
But I ſpeak now to your capacity, and to ſatisfie your Queſtion. He was indicted for
levying War againſt the King, he conſpired in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the War was levyed in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
County; the Conſpiracy upon the Tryal was proved in the County of <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex,</hi>

in the County of <hi>Middleſex.</hi>

others to take Arms, particularly <hi>Turbervile,</hi> He told you he had no Arms, or but a
caſe of Piſtols, and he had no Horſe; but you told him you would provide him an
Horſe. And then there are two other Witneſſes, <hi>Smith</hi> and <hi>Bryan Haynes,</hi> they
do not tell you of any thing done at <hi>Oxford,</hi> but they tell you what you ſaid in

               <p>My Lord, I do not queſtion but to prove this one of the Helliſheſt Conſpiracies
that ever was upon the face of the Earth, and theſe the moſt notorious wicked men, an
abſolute deſign to deſtroy all the Proteſtants of <hi>England,</hi> that have had the courage to
oppoſe the Popiſh Plot. In which no man of my condition hath done more then I have
done. I was bred a Proteſtant, and continued ſo hitherto, and by the Grace of God
I will dye ſo. If that they had known of theſe words that I ſhould ſpeak, and ſuch a
deſign that I ſhould have before the Parliament ſat at <hi>Oxon.</hi> and be with me in
<hi>Oxon.</hi> when the Parliament ſat, if they had been good Subjects, they ought to have
had me apprehended. <hi>Turbervile</hi> came ſeveral times indeed, and dined with me. I
did not bid him go out of doors, nor invited him thither; he was a man I had no diſreſpect
for, nay he was a man I valued, thinking he had done the Nation ſervice againſt the
Papiſts; that this man ſhould hear me ſpeak ſuch words againſt His Majeſty, who was
then in this Town, and know of ſuch a dangerous deſign to attempt the ſeizing of his
Perſon, or that I ſhould diſcover a great party that were ready to do it, I think there is
ſcarce any man of reaſon, but will ſay, if this were really done and ſpoken by me, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them would or ought to have concealed it, but diſcover it; none of them has ever
charged me with any ſuch thing, they have been in my company ſince. I never had any
correſpondence with any of them but <hi>Dugdale,</hi> then pray conſider how improbable it is,
that I should talk of ſuch things to Papiſts, Prieſts and <hi>Irish-men,</hi> who have broke their
faith with their own party, that faith which they gave under the penalty of Damnation,
men that have been concerned in Plots and Treaſons, to murder and cut the Throats of
Proteſtants, that I should be ſuch a mad man to truſt theſe people, when I could receive
no manner of obligation from them, nor could give any truſt to them, they having before
broke either Faith; eſpecially, conſidering I could lay no ſuch Oaths and Obligations upon
them, who was a Proteſtant; then 'tis the greateſt non ſenſe, to believe that I would ſay
theſe things before perſons whom I could never hope would conceal my Treaſons, having
diſcovered their own. If they ſpeak truth concerning the general Popish Plot, that
could be no obligation upon me to truſt them with another; and they cannot ſay, that
they ever obliged me in any one reſpect. My Lord, I thank God I have had ſome acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in the world, and have been concerned with ſome perſons of Honour, Noblemen and
Parliament men, that I know are as good Subjects as any His Majeſty has; theſe never
found me a Fool, nor a Raſcal, ſo great a Knave, as to have any ſuch thoughts in my heart,
nor ſo great a mad-man, or ſo foolish, as to go to diſcover them to Papiſts, Prieſts, and
<hi>Irish-men,</hi> to men of their condition, that were ready to ſtarve for Bread. As for <hi>Haynes</hi>
and <hi>Smith,</hi> that run ſo faſt through all their Evidence, the firſt time that ever I ſet my
eyes on <hi>Haynes,</hi> was in the Coffee-Houſe that he ſpeaks of; <hi>Macnamarra</hi> comes in, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:31349:31"/>
deſires me to go out with with him, and I should hear the greateſt Diſcovery of a piece
of Villany againſt my Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Life, that ever I heard many life. This
Captain <hi>Brown,</hi> who is now dead, a man that I had not known but a month before (for
I think it was in <hi>March</hi> laſt when this was) could teſtifie for me; For I came to him,
Captain, ſaid I, here is a Diſcovery offered to be made to me, of a Deſign to take away
my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Life. <hi>Macnamarra</hi> asks me to go to the <hi>Hercules Pillars,</hi> I went
along with him, and took Captain <hi>Brown</hi> with us. Afterwards he fell ſick in <hi>April,</hi>
and is now dead, ſo I loſt a main Evidence in the caſe. He was the only man that was
by at the time; God knows my Heart, <hi>I</hi> ſpeak nothing but the truth, I took him with me,
<hi>Haynes</hi> began to diſcover to us, that <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> had employed him to fetch over <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namarra,</hi>
and if he would come in, and ſwear againſt my Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> which
was his deſign, it would not be long e're his Head were taken off, and he ſaid, He had
given in a Paper of High Treaſon againſt my Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> I asked what it was,
He told me, That my Lord ſhould tell <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> that he had a deſign to bring this
Kingdom to a Common Wealth, and to root out the Family of the <hi>Stuarts.</hi> This he ſaid
<hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> had given in in a Paper under his own Hand; and I think he ſaid, He had
ſworn it, and ſent <hi>Haynes</hi> to fetch <hi>Macnamarra</hi> to ſwear agaiſt my Lord the ſame things
too. I writ down all the Heads of the Diſcourſe which Captain <hi>Brown</hi> heard as well
as I. After he had ſaid it, he deſired us to conceal it. Sir, ſaid I, You are a ſtranger to
me, and theſe are great and ſtrange things that you do tell us, <hi>Macnamarra</hi> and <hi>Browne</hi>
and <hi>Ivy,</hi> and others were there, which (if they were honeſt men) they would come and
teſtifie. I thought them honeſt men, and that they had none of thoſe wicked deſigns in
their Hearts, that now I find they have. So ſays <hi>Haynes, I do not know this man,</hi>
meaning me; <hi>Macnamarra</hi> told him, <hi>I was an honeſt man, he might lay his Life in my
hands.</hi> After he had ſpoken all this, he deſired us to conceal it; Said he, <hi>I will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcover this, but a great deal more of their Rogueries that I know very well;</hi> Said
I to him again, <hi>I will not conceal it, nor do you no wrong, for if this be true my Lord
of</hi> Shaftsbury <hi>shall know it to night; for where there is a Deſign to take away a Peer
of the Realm, I will not conceal it; but if it be falſe, and you have ſaid more then
comes to your share, recant it again, and we will take no notice of it, only ſay you are a
Knave for ſpeaking of it; he ſwore Dam him it was all true, that and a great deal
more, which he ſaid he knew, about ſeizing and deſtroying the Parliament at</hi> Oxon. <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
an Army in the</hi> North <hi>that was to be raiſed about the time of the ſitting of the
Parliament at</hi> Oxon. <hi>of a</hi> French <hi>Army that was to land in</hi> Ireland <hi>at the ſame time, that
the D. of</hi> York <hi>was to be at the Head of them, and the intention was, to deſtroy all the
Proteſtants.</hi> Upon this, I was reſolved, if I lived, to come along with the Parliament,
and if there was any ſuch Deſign, I was reſolved to live and die with them, but I had no
more then common Arms, a Sword and a caſe of Piſtols, and my Cap was a Velvet Cap,
and nothing elſe. My Lord, I had the Honour to be ſent for, when the Parliament ſat
laſt at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the Sesſions in <hi>October,</hi> it was an Honourable occaſion, and I thank
thoſe worthy Gentlemen that ſent me for the Honour of it, there I begun to be popular as
to my Name, for from that time they began to call me the Proteſtant Joyner, becauſe the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:31349:32"/>
Parliament had intruſted me. My Lord <hi>Grey</hi> was pleaſed to ſend his Footman for me
to the <hi>Crown Tavern</hi> behind the <hi>Exchange,</hi> where there were ſeveral worthy Lords,
Peers of the Realm, and one Hundred of the Commons, that had dined there that day,
it was the day before they ſat; after they had dined I came to them, and the Duke of
<hi>Monmouth</hi> told me, They had heard a good Report of me, that I was an honeſt man,
that underſtood Building, and they did confide in me to ſearch under the Parliament
Houſe; they did not really know of any Deſign, but they would not be ſecure, there might
be ſome tricks play'd them by the Papiſts, tho' we are not afraid of them, ſaid the Duke,
yet we think fit to employ you to ſearch under the Houſes, whether you can find any ſuch
practices. So accordingly my Lord, I did go, my Lord <hi>Lovelace</hi> was one of the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Lords, and my Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> that went with me, and ſome of the Gentlemen of the
Houſe of Commons; and thoſe worthy Proteſtant Lords were pleaſed to thank me for my
Service, and did believe I was active and zealous to find out and diſcover the bottom of
the Popiſh Plot, ſo far as it came legally in my way to do it. My Lord, upon this occaſion,
there was a great kindneſs from them to me, and I had upon all occaſions teſtimonies of
it; and this very man who now ſwears Treaſons againſt me (which God Almighty
knows is all falſe) did ſwear in his Affidavit before Sir <hi>George Treby</hi> the Recorder
of <hi>London</hi> (I did never ſee the Affidavit, indeed I was over night at Sir <hi>George Treby</hi>'s,
but he was not then at leiſure, but he drew it up next day, and ſwore it) that there was a
Deſign to deſtroy the Parliament at <hi>Oxon.</hi> and there was not only his Oath for it, but it
was the general belief, that ſome Evil was intended them. All men had cauſe to fear and
to ſuſpect, the Papiſts did bear them no good will; and making uſe of their own obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
they were generally armed with a Piſtol, or a Sword for themſelves, in caſe they
ſhould be attck'd by the Papiſts. In order to this, I did come down with my Lord
<hi>Howard,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Clare,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Huntington,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Pagett,</hi> thoſe
four worthy Proteſtant Lords; and it was two days after the Parliament was ſat, that
we came, and I went out of Town again with my Lord <hi>Lovelace,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Player</hi> and
Sir <hi>Robert Clayton;</hi> and I am ſure, they were all in ſo great a fear that <hi>London</hi> ſhould
be ſurprized and ſeized on by the Papiſts, but there was no mortal man that ever heard of
the Kings being ſeized, or thought of it, till theſe men come and tell me, that I had
ſuch a Deſign, and came hither with that purpoſe; but my Lord, I declare as God is
my Judge, I would not have it thought I ſpeak it to ſave my life, were it as certainly a
truth, as 'tis moſt wickedly a falſhood, that I had had a deſign to ſeize the King, I know
not of one man who was to ſtand by me, Parliament man, or other perſons whatſoever;
And how is it posſible for me to attempt that, being a ſingle perſon, with only a Sword
and a caſe of Piſtols, let any man judge. And I do declare, I know of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy
nor Deſign, againſt the King or Government, I never ſpoke one of the
Treaſonable Words in my life, that is laid againſt me, nor had ever any thoughts
of any ſuch thing. God that is my Eternal Judge knows, that what I ſpeak
is true.</p>

               <p>Well, Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> will you call your Witneſſes, for I muſt tell the

               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I thank God, I know my own innocency, and hope to prove it. I
have a Soul that muſt live to eternity, either in joy or miſery, I act according to thoſe
principles, and I hope I have ſome aſſurance of my own Salvation when I dye: I would
not call God to Witneſs to a lye, to ſave 1000 lives. My Lord, this is a villanous conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
againſt me, and if it take place againſt me, it may go a great way, God knows how
far. This is the <hi>17th.</hi> or <hi>18th.</hi> Sham Plot the Papiſts have made againſt the Proteſtants,
to get over their own; but I hope, my Lord, God Almighty will never ſuffer it. If they
can make me a Traytor, they will try it upon others, and ſo hope to sham off their own
Treaſons; but I ſay, I hope God Almighty will never ſuffer it. My Lord, I think the firſt
Witneſs that ſwore againſt me was Mr. <hi>Dugdale;</hi> and I muſt call my Witneſſes as I have
them here, I know no perſon of them hardly, and this tht is done for my Defence was
done abroad. My Lord, I have been kept cloſe Priſoner in the Tower, and none of them
ſuffered to come to me, whilſt the Popish Lords have had the liberty and priviledge to talk
with their friends. Here are VVitneſſes I hope will prove that thoſe are Suborned men,
for <hi>Macnamarra</hi> did tell me preſently after the Parliament broke up at <hi>Oxon.</hi> and whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
it to me in the Coffee-Houſe; Said he, there is a deſign laid to make us retract our
Evidence, and go over to <hi>Fitz-Gerald.</hi> Said I, I ſuppoſe they have been at that ſport a
great while. Ah, ſaid he, they make large offers. Said I, by whom? Said he, Colonel
<hi>Warcupp</hi> hath been at me, and he tells me—</p>

to tell which would do his buſineſs for him; but the next news I heard of him was, he was
put into <hi>Newgate.</hi>

more danger from ſuch people than I could diſcover any other way. So I went up
ſtairs, and ſtood at the door and hearkened, hearing my Landlady talk ſomething to

<hi>I</hi> told him <hi>I</hi> muſt expoſe my ignorance, <hi>I</hi> did not know what it was he was tried for:
And, ſaid he, if you pleaſe to ſit down, <hi>I</hi> will tell you: Madam <hi>Portſmouth</hi> came to
him, and went upon her knees, and begg'd of him, if he had any kindneſs for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
that he would now shew it at this juncture; and she told him she had heard he
had formerly acquaintance with one Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> abroad, and therefore deſired him to
go now and renew it, and endeavour to get him over, and, if he could poſſibly, to get
over ſome others to make a Presbyterian Plot of it. This is true, I very well know it:

I had a meſſage from the King; a Juſtice of Peace met me, and brought me word that
the King had ſent into <hi>Ireland</hi> to enquire into the Loyalty of my Family, and he hath
heard that my Father was a Loyal Subject, but he underſtood ſtrange things of me;
but if I would come in, he would grant me my Pardon. I told him, ſaid he, I did
not value his Majeſties Pardon a pin, for I had done nothing that might make
me ſtand in need of it; but I would do any thing that might tend to the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Majeſties Perſon or Honour; but to do ſuch baſe things as are beneath a

man, I will never do it; and he wiſper'd me in the ear as the accuſing of ſeveral
perſons;) and ſince, he ſent me a Letter by his Mother in Law, Mrs. <hi>Wingfield,</hi> that
I should not believe it, if I heard he should accuſe any body; but I might be confident
he had not, nor would not accuſe any body.</p>

or had an hand, in putting the Plot upon the diſſenting Proteſtants: and he
telling my Miſtreſs he had a meſſage from the King, offering him his Pardon; <hi>I</hi> asked
him why he did not accept the Kings Pardon. Alaſs, ſaid he, you do not underſtand
what <hi>I</hi> was to do for it; <hi>I</hi> was to do ſuch baſe things ſo beneath a man, that I will
never do them: I had Five Hundred pounds offered me, beſides the Kings Pardon,
to do ſuch baſe things as are beneath a man to do.</p>

hither: but about ſix years ago, <hi>Bryan Haynes</hi> was a priſoner in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> and
he came down to the Cellar which I had taken of the Marshal to ſell Drink in; and
coming down to drink in one of the Rooms of the Cellar that belong to me, he took
away a tankard, and went up with it. One of the men followed him up; ſo I went to the
Marshal to complain, and told him of it: and the Marshal took him from the Maſters
ſide, and put him into the common ſide. That is all I know of him any way, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or indirectly.</p>

               <p>I have ſeen him twice: the firſt time I ever ſaw him was, I went into
the <hi>Derby</hi>-Ale-Houſe, to enquire for one <hi>Miclethwayte,</hi> a Kinſman of mine, and
there this <hi>Bryan Haynes</hi> was in a little Room next the Ditch, near the Door that goes
out there, as if he were aſleep, and he rouſed himſelf up; and, as I was walking
there, Sir, ſaid he, will you take part of a Tankard with me: (That was his expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.)
With that, ſaid I, I do not care if I do. And the firſt thing he began was
the Kings Health, then the Queens, then the Duke of <hi>Yorks;</hi> then he fell very foul
againſt the Grand Jury, becauſe they had not found the Bill againſt <hi>Colledge,</hi> who is a
Gentleman that I never ſaw before in my life but once, as I know of: and he ſaid,
my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was a little Toad, but he would do his buſineſs very ſuddenly.
Then he raiſed upon the Parliament, and ſaid they were a Company of Rogues, they
would giue the King no mony, but he would help him to mony enough out of the
Phanaticks Eſtates. And he ſaid, they would damn their Souls to the Devil before
the Catholick cauſe ſhould ſink.</p>

               <p>One thing more, my Lord. On <hi>monday</hi> laſt I was at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> and a
Gentleman ſent his man on purpoſe to let me know I muſt go to <hi>Colebrook,</hi> and ſtay
till they came thither. When I came there, I met <hi>Bryan Haynes</hi> at the <hi>Crown</hi> Kitchin-window,
and he was ſtirring a Glaſs of Brandy, and ſweetning it with Sugar. Said
he, Sir, will you drink? Here is the Kings Health to you: So I drank, and I asked
him how he did? Do you know me, Sir, ſaid he. Yes, ſaid I, I drank with
you once. Says he, you have a good memory. So then a pint of Sack was called
for, and after that another, and then came down Mrs. <hi>Peacock;</hi> and being very fine,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:31349:36"/>
all in her flower'd Silks, I asked what Gentlewoman that was? Said he, it is Mrs.
<hi>Fitz-Harris.</hi> No, ſays I, it is not; they ſay ſhe is gone. But, ſaid he, it is her maid;
and Sheriff <hi>Bethel</hi> is to marry her. As I have a Soul to ſave, I tell you nothing but
what is truth. Thereupon ſaid I, Sheriff <hi>Bethel</hi> is able to maintain her; he hath a
good Eſtate. But, ſaid he, it ſhall be the Kings e're long.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Lun.</speaker>
               <p>So with that, my Lord, if it pleaſe your Honour, I clapped my Groat
down at the Bar, and went out of the Room. Nay, ſaid he, let us have one Health
more: and ſo he had his Tankard, and I had mine.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I am a ſtranger to the Priſoner at the Bar; what I have to
ſay, is concerning Mr. <hi>Turbervile,</hi> whom I met one day, and he asked me how I did?
ſaid he, I owe you a little Money, but I will pay you in a short time; but if you will go
to drink a glaſs of Ale; no, ſaid I, I am in haſte, and do not care for going to drink;
ſaid he, you ſhall go; ſo away we went, and when we were ſat, ſaid he, When did you
ſee <hi>Turbervile</hi> that was my Lord <hi>Powis</hi>'s Butler; ſaid he, he was a great Rogue to me,
and when I ſtood up for the Nations good, he vilified my Evidence, and afterwards he
came to me with Doctor <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap> to beg my pardon; but I would not forgive him for
the whole World: And ſpeaking of the Kings Evidence, ſaid he, the Kings Evidence
are looked upon as nothing, as poor inconſiderable mean Fellows, and their Sallaries
are leſſened; and, ſaid he, I have had the greateſt proffers from Court, of preferment
and rewards, if I would go from what I have ſaid, and come upon the contrary; and
he repeated it, Yes, upon the Faith of a man, and from the Higheſt: But, ſaid he, I
have a Soul and a Body; a Body for a time, but my Soul for eternity, and I cannot go
from it. He went over it again; I might have what I would if I would go from what I
have ſaid, and come upon the contrary.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>If I knew any thing relating to you, I would declare it; but I know

               <p>As to <hi>Turbervile,</hi> my Lord, a little before the Witneſſes were ſworn at
the <hi>Old-Bailey,</hi> I met with Mr. <hi>Tubervile:</hi> I was in a Coach, but ſeeing Mr. <hi>Turber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile,</hi>
I ſtept out of the Coach, and ſpoke with him; for, hearing that he was a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
I did ask him whether he was a Witneſs or no againſt <hi>Colledge?</hi> Mr. <hi>Turbervile</hi>
ſaid, He would break any one's Head that should ſay ſo againſt him; for he neither
was a Witneſs, nor could give any Evidence againſt him. So after he came from
<hi>Oxon.</hi> I met with Mr. <hi>Turbervile</hi> again; and, hearing he had been there, I asked him
if he had ſworn any thing againſt <hi>Colledge?</hi> He ſaid, yes, he had been ſworn before
the Grand Jury. Said I, did not you tell me ſo and ſo? Why, ſaid he, the Proteſtant
Citizens have deſerted us; and <hi>God dam him, he would not ſtarve.</hi>

               <p>My Lord, the firſt part of the Doctor's diſcourſe, in part is true;
I met him juſt at my Lodgings, and the Doctor alighted out of his Coach, and ſpoke
to me, and invited me to come to my old Friends; for he told me they had ſome jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jouſie
that I was not true to them: and he told me, if I would come to the King's-Head
Club, I should be received with a great deal of kindneſs; and never afterwards
did I ſpeak with the Doctor a tittle about any Evidence.</p>

and it can plainly be made to appear there is ſubornation againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.
And moreover, my Lord,—</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>There is, my Lord, and there will be made further to appear in time to
come. To my own knowledge as to Mr. <hi>Smith, Mr. Colledge</hi> and <hi>Mr. Smith</hi> had
ſome provoking words paſſed betwixt them at <hi>Richard</hi>'s Coffee-Houſe, and <hi>Mr. Smith</hi>
comes out and ſwears, <hi>God dam him, he would have</hi> Colledge<hi>'s blood.</hi> So, my Lord,
when I met him; ſaid I, Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> you profeſs your ſelf to be a Prieſt, and have
ſtood at the Altar; and now you intend to take upon you the Miniſtry of the Church
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:31349:39"/>
of <hi>England,</hi> and theſe words do not become a Miniſter of the Goſpel; his reply was,
<hi>God dam the Goſpel;</hi> this is truth, I ſpeak it in the preſence of God and man.</p>

               <p>As for Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> I was ingaged for him for <hi>50 l.</hi> for laſt Lent Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſizes,
he wanted money to go down to the Aſſizes, having paid ſome debts, and paid
away all his money; and ſo I engaged for <hi>50 l.</hi> that he borrowed of <hi>Richard</hi> the Coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
After he came from <hi>Oxon.</hi> I called upon him to haſten to get his money of the
Lords in the Treaſury; which, as near as I remember, was ordered him upon his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,
for ſo <hi>I</hi> heard. And at that time, ſaid he, Sir, I hear there is a great noiſe of my
being an Evidence; againſt whom, ſaid I, againſt ſeveral Proteſtants, my Lord
<hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and others, ſaid I: I never heard any thing of it; ſays he, there is no body

               <p>My Lord, I ſay further, if any Doctor will come forth and ſay he cured

            <sp>
               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I think this is not fair dealing with a man for his Life; becauſe
theſe men be upon their Oaths, and deny the things again that my Witneſſes prove, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
what they ſwear muſt needs be taken for truth: but if my Witneſs comes and ſays
ſuch a thing upon the word of a Miniſter, and in the preſence of God, and which he is
ready to maintain by an Oath, ſure it is not to ſtand for nothing; nor he to be hooted out
of Court, becauſe Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> denies it upon his Oath, I do ſuppoſe he will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it. But, my Lord, I am the Priſoner, and cannot be heard as a Witneſs for my ſelf:
but God is my Witneſs, he hath ſaid a great deal more to me formerly; and he hath told
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:31349:40"/>
me when I have ſeen him with <hi>Warcup,</hi> and asked him why he kept company with
<hi>Warcup,</hi> and others; ſaid he, I know they are ſuſpected men, but I muſt keep company
with them to get my money; what would you have me do, ſtarve. And when I lent
him money out of my pocket, and truſted him with my Horſe, I dunn'd him for money and
could not get it; ſaid I, will you pay me the <hi>5 l.</hi> I lent you; he put me off, ſaid he, I
ſhall have it, for the Attorney General hath made up his Accompts, and he is very kind
to me; why then, ſaid I, why have you it not; ſaid he, he is my Friend, and I do not
queſtion the getting of it; but here is new work to be done, ſuch work as my conſcience
will not ſerve me to do; there is more Roguery, they will never have done plotting, and
counterplotting; but they will make a thouſand Plots if they can to deſtroy the real

               <p>Then you should not ſpeak it. But you asked the queſtion whether a man

are not upon their Oaths, but they may be Witneſſes, and their weight is to be left
with the Jury; they will conſider how improbable it is, that theſe men should come,
three men to one man, and all of them should ſpeak that which would make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Rogues and Villains; and that one man of them, <hi>Smith,</hi> should ſay ſuch words,
as, <hi>God damn him, he would have his blood,</hi> and <hi>God damn the Goſpel:</hi> that <hi>Dugdale</hi>
should confeſs he was wrought upon by <hi>Warcup</hi> to teſtifie againſt his Conſcience;

               <p>What he knows of Mr. <hi>Smith.</hi>

               <speaker>Mr. S. <hi>Smith.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>John Smith</hi> and I have had an intimacy and acquaintaince ſeveral
months, and ſince Mr. <hi>John Smith</hi> ſwore at the <hi>Old Baily</hi> againſt Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> and was
gone out of Town, ſeveral people have talked with me concerning him, and asking
me what I thought of him? I told them, I believed he was an honeſt man, however I
would not believe otherwiſe till I knew a reaſon of it. They told me, that he had
ſworn againſt Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> that he was to ſeize the King at the Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi>
and that there was 1500 Barrels of Powder, and it was to carry on a Presbyterian Plot:
Said I, I will never believe it, and the rather becauſe he hath ſaid to me often, there
was a Popish Plot, but he does not believe any Presbyterian or Proteſtant Plot; and
ſaid I further, as to his giving in any Evidence with <hi>Iriſh-men,</hi> I believe it the leſs for
that; for I have heard him often ſay, they were a company of Rogues that had done
the Proteſtant Intereſt more harm than ever they would do it good, and bid me have
a care of coming into their company, and many other ſuch things, that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> here
knows to be true. Then, my Lord, when Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> came home (for I was very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
till he did come home to hear every day ſuch things ſaid againſt him) I went to
ſee him. Said I, Couſin <hi>Smith,</hi> I have had great confronts about you ſince you
went away, but I hope you can't be that ill man you are repreſented to be, and truly I
should be ſorry it should be ſo: pray Couſin, ſaid I, I have put every man off with
this, that I would ſuſpend my belief of you till I had ſpoken with your ſelf; what is the
Evidence you have given? They ſay, you have ſworn a Presbyterian Plot, or a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:31349:41"/>
Plot, a Deſign of ſeizing the King at <hi>Oxon.</hi> and of ſo many Barrels of Gen-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that were provided. Says my Couſin, I did ſwear no ſuch thing, nor never a word
of any ſuch thing as a Proteſtant Plot, or a Presbyterian Plot, and pray do not believe
it of me. No, ſaid I, I thought you could not ſwear any ſuch thing, becauſe you have
ſaid often to me, you believed there was no ſuch thing. I do not believe it yet, ſaid
he, and as to whatſoever <hi>Colledge</hi> ſaid, I did not believe it, for he did not believe it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
And Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> told me after his return that he did not know of any Proteſtant
concerned in the Plot.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. S. Smith.</speaker>

                  <hi>Mr. Smith,</hi> thus I underſtand you. You ſay that he ſaid to you, That
he had not teſtified any thing of a Proteſtant Plot, nor did believe there was any Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Plot, for he did not believe what <hi>Colledge</hi> ſaid himſelf: So by that diſcoure it
ſeems he did not deny, but he had teſtified againſt Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> but he did not
believe there was any Proteſtant Plot?</p>

               <p>This <hi>I</hi> do ſay, <hi>I</hi> would not ſpeak more nor leſs than the truth, he did not
deny, but he had heard <hi>Colledge</hi> ſpeak thoſe words he ſwore, but he did not believe
him, and <hi>I</hi> think Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> hath ſaid that at another time before Mr. <hi>Gardner.</hi>

of late againſt other men that he hath given me a very good report of before; And
when <hi>I</hi> was talking of this, <hi>I</hi> was ſaying, if it be true that people ſay of you, a man goes
in danger of his life to converſe with you. Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I</hi> do not care for all the
men between <hi>Wapping</hi> and <hi>Charing-croſs,</hi> there is never a man that will forbear my
company, but would do or ſay as much as <hi>Colledge</hi> hath done or ſaid.</p>

               <p>My Lord, this day fortnight I think it was, <hi>Mr. S. Smith,</hi> the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
that was juſt now up before me, ſent for me to the <hi>Rummer</hi> in <hi>Queen-ſtreet</hi> to
drink a glaſs of Wine, where, when <hi>I</hi> came, <hi>I</hi> found him and <hi>Mr. J. Smith</hi> that is here,
whom they call Narrative <hi>Smith,</hi> talking very briskly concerning one <hi>Colledge, I</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that is the Gentleman, and the Jury that acquitted him, and he ſaid that two or
three of the Jury-men were Raſcals and Villains; and, ſays he, they talk up and down
the Town as if <hi>I</hi> did intend to Sham the Popish Plot, and to make a Proteſtant Plot;
which, ſaid he, <hi>I</hi> vow to God, and <hi>I</hi> will juſtifie it before God, and all the World, that
I know of no Proteſtant Plot, nor is there any Proteſtant concerned in a Plot to my
knowledge, but this <hi>Colledge,</hi> and upon his Tryal I believe he will be made appear to
be more a Papiſt than a Proteſtant; but ſays Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> to him, Now you are known
to be a Witneſs in this caſe, it will be a dangerous thing for a man to converſe with
you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>Will it be now known that I am a Papiſt? No man could ever ſay ſo in this

               </speaker>

all the men from <hi>Wapping</hi> to <hi>Charing-Croſs,</hi> but that man that will shun my company,
will ſay and do as much to the King as <hi>Colledge</hi> hath done. But then <hi>I</hi> was ſaying, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
it ſeems an improbable thing, that ſuch a man as <hi>Colledge</hi> should ſeize upon the
King, or provide 1500 Barrels of Powder, and thoſe other things. Upon my word,
ſaid he, with ſome paſſion, clapping his hand upon his breaſt, when Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> did ſay
it, I did not believe a word of it; and upon my Faith I believe <hi>Colledge</hi> himſelf did not
believe it when he told me ſo.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I heard Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> ſpeaking of it at the <hi>Old-Bailey,</hi> and if you
pleaſe to take notice, it was thus; This Summer was twelve-month, or I am ſure a great
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:31349:42"/>
while before <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> the Alderman had invited me ſeveral times to give me a Treat,
and I had not time, other buſineſs calling me off, but finding a time, I ſent him
word I would come and ſee him. He ſaid he was a Brewer and troubled at home with
cuſtomers, but he would give me a Dinner at the <hi>Crown</hi> Tavern without <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi>
that was the place fixed upon; there was <hi>Mr. Smith</hi> the Counſellor, who had been ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to me in ſeveral inſtances, I did get him to go along with me, and Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi>
was with us, and I heard <hi>Smith</hi> ſwearing at the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> and he had
diſcourſe from the <hi>Rainbow</hi> Coffee-Houſe where we met, and went together.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>There I was invited by Alderman <hi>Wilcox.</hi>

               </speaker>
               <p>But my Lord, I will tell my ſtory, I am not to tell Mr. <hi>Smiths; Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
did tell me he was invited; ſaid I, You shall be welcome as far as I can make
you welcome. So <hi>Colledge</hi> ahd I went together from the <hi>Rainbow</hi> Coffe-Houſe to the
<hi>Crown</hi> Tavern: Now indeed <hi>Colledge</hi> was very pleaſant and merry, and as I think,
the diſcourſe betwixt the <hi>Rainbow</hi> Coffee-Houſe and the Tavern was betwixt <hi>Mr.
Colledge</hi> and me; for <hi>Mr. Smith</hi> ſtayed ſomewhat behind or walked before, I cannot
tell which: When we came to the <hi>Crown</hi> Tavern we did, to divert our ſelves till Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
came up, enter into a Philoſophical diſcourſe with one Mr. <hi>Savage,</hi> who was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſt, but this <hi>Savage</hi> is ſince pardoned by the King and is a member
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and hath been Profeſſor of Divinity and Philoſophy beyond
Sea. This as I remember was the diſcourſe before we dined till we went to dinner, it
was concerning the Exiſtence of God whether that could be proved by natural demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
and whether or no the Soul was immortal: my Lord, after dinner <hi>Smith</hi> went
away; I did not hear the leaſt diſcourſe of any ſuch thing as he ſpeaks of, and Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>
and <hi>Colledge</hi> had no diſcourſe in my hearing from the Coffee-Houſe to the Tavern;
and when we were in the Tavern we did diſcourſe about thoſe two Points. Counſellor
<hi>Smith,</hi> my Lord, will juſtifie a great deal of this, and my Brother too, who was with us.
But when I heard Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> ſwear as he did about this matter at the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> I did
really, my Lord, in my conſcience look upon him to be forſworn in that particular.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> T. Smith.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, if your Lordship pleaſe, I do very well remember Mr.
Alderman <hi>VVilcox,</hi> ſo they called him, did deſire to give Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> a Treat, with ſome
other of his Friends, at the <hi>Crown-Tavern</hi> without <hi>Temple-Bar;</hi> but really, my Lord,
as to the certain time I do not remember it, but to my beſt remembrance, my Lord, it
was before <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> laſt, and ſome time before <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> laſt. And, my Lord, I
was there all the time, Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> was at that time ſomewhat a ſtranger to me, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
I had heard of his name, and I did ſtay there all the while: I remember Mr. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman
<hi>VVilcox</hi> was to go out of Town that day; and truly, as to any thing of matter
of Treaſon, or Treaſonable words; or any thing tending towards it; I am confident
nothing was, or could be ſpoken, and the room was a very ſmall room, and our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
did fill it up, and the Table was ſo big, that there was little more than for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitors
to go about, ſo that any man might eaſily hear from the one end of the room to
the other. I remember there was ſome diſcourſe betwixt Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Savage,</hi>
who I think hath been a Jeſuit, and it was about ſome points of Philoſophy and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
but for Treaſon, I do not remember the leaſt of it, and I am confident <hi>Colledge</hi>
ſaid not any ſuch thing at that time, and my reaſon is this; I very well remember Mr.
<hi>Colledge</hi> did ſet himſelf down upon one ſide of the Table, and fell aſleep, and unleſs he
talked Treaſon in his ſleep, there could not be any ſuch thing ſaid, and if it had been
ſaid, it would have been heard.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> do not ſpeak of all that was done; but <hi>I</hi> ſay <hi>I</hi> remember no ſuch
thing that was ſaid, and <hi>I</hi> believe no ſuch thing was ſaid, and have given you my reaſons
why. But, my Lord, that which <hi>I</hi> ſay further for Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> is this; <hi>I</hi> do hear
ſomething pretended, as if he provided Arms to go for <hi>Oxford. I</hi> have known him this
three years, or thereabouts; and, my Lord, <hi>I</hi> do know that he did uſually ride with a
caſe of Piſtols before him. And before that time I had occaſion to borrow his Horſe
of him, at the Election for <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the laſt Parliament that ſat there, and I had it
then with a caſe of Piſtols. I likewiſe borrowed it at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> laſt, the ſame Horſe,
and the ſame Piſtols they were: I did at the ſame time ſee a Suit of Silk-Armour,
which he told me he did provide againſt the Papiſts, for he ſaid he did expect we should
have a brush with them. Said <hi>I,</hi> do not trouble your ſelf for that, they dare not meddle;
ſaid he, this will do no harm. And, as I remember, it was a Suit of Armour made of
Silk, to wear under a Coat.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>It was Silk Armour only for the thruſt of a Sword. And I aſſure you,
my Lord, I had but one Suit, but one caſe of Piſtols, and but one Horſe, I had two before,
but they did not then make a Traytor of me, that was all that ever I had; but if I had ten
Horſes, and never ſo many Armours, I declare it upon my Salvation, I intended it for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but againſt the Papiſts, if they ſhould make a diſturbance, and whatever I did was
with that deſign, and truly, by the Grace of God, I would not have been the laſt man then;
but I ſee, whatever I provided my ſelf with for that, they have turned it all another
way, that it might be believed the Proteſtants were againſt the King and the eſtablished
Government.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. T. Smith.</speaker>
               <p>I dare not undertake to ſay that, I cannot tell whether he went from

               <p>He ſays after we had dined we divided our ſelves into Cabals, two and two to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
I do declare it, as that which is the real truth, I fell aſleep behind the Table, if
any body was divided, it is more than I know; but Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> you can tell, becauſe he
ſays I ſpoke Treaſon to him when I was in the room, he and I in one Cabal.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. T. S.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I remember nothing of that, nor do believe it, for I told you
the room was ſo little that we could not divide our ſelves; and it is impoſſible in ſuch a
little compaſs where we were, ſo many as we were, 14 or 15 of us; it may be one
might talk to another that was next to him, but then the company muſt hear, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they did ſo or no, I cannot tell, I do not remember <hi>Mr. Smith's</hi> ſaying any thing
to any particular perſon, but the great engagement was between Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Mr.
Savage,</hi> and about ſome queſtions in Divinity, and that is the great matter I took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>However, my Lord, I declare it, that was above a twelve-month ago, and I
hope your Lordship and the Jury does obſerve that there was no new Arms were found but
what were provided a great while ago: All that know me, know I was never without a
caſe of Piſtols and an Horſe, though I was but a Joyner, and there is no more that you ſee
now. And as to what <hi>Smith</hi> ſaid about our going into Cabals, that you hear Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>

<hi>Mowbray,</hi> and my ſelf were travelling from <hi>York</hi> towards <hi>London.</hi> We lay the <hi>24th.</hi>
at and the <hi>25th.</hi> we were travelling towards <hi>London:</hi> Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> did
ask me, if I did remember what Diſcourſe there was betwixt Sir <hi>John Brooks</hi> and I at
<hi>Ferry-bridge,</hi> when we were coming up before to <hi>London?</hi> I deſired him to tell me
what diſcourſe, and I would tell him if I did remember it or no. So my Lord, he did
ſay, the Diſcourſe was, that Sir <hi>John Brooks</hi> did ſay, there would be cutting of throats at
<hi>Oxford,</hi> and that the Parliament did go provided, ſome with 8, ſome with 6, ſome
with 4 men, and they were to meet at <hi>Grantham,</hi> and go together. This diſcourſe
I did remember, that Sir <hi>John Brooks</hi> ſaid, they went with Horſe and Arms to ſecure
them from High-way-men; and Sir <hi>John Brooks</hi> did then further declare, that the
Diſcourſe was, there would be cutting of throats at <hi>Oxford,</hi> which made them go with
Arms to defend themſelves. Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> did further upon the 25, 26, 27, and <hi>28th.</hi>
of <hi>July</hi> (and it was our frequent diſcourſe) tell me, that he had given His Majeſty an
account of it, which occaſioned the Diſſolving of the Parliament: That Diſcourſe
that was made to the King, was, that Sir <hi>John Brooks</hi> should ſay, there would be cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:31349:45"/>
of throats at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and that the Parliament-men went provided with 4 or 5,
6 or 10 men apiece; and he did tell me, he had given a further account, that there
was a Conſult a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Grantham,</hi> wherein it was reſolved, that it was better to ſeize
the King, than to let him go on. Now, this I knew nothing of, but he would have
perſwaded me to have given in this Evidence againſt Sir <hi>John Brooks,</hi> as to this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
But I declare, I did never hear it, and Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> was the firſt man that ever I
heard it from, I never heard it before in my life.</p>

manage it rightly againſt my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> and <hi>Colledge,</hi> he would make me for ever;
thoſe two perſons were mentioned all along. But I do declare it, I did never hear
them ſpeak Treaſon againſt the King in my life. And he did further tell me, that I
muſt ſay ſo and ſo; for if we did not agree, it would ſignifie nothing. But, my Lord,
I know nothing of the matter, I never heard any one ſpeak of it but <hi>Mr. Smith.</hi> My
Lord, this is true, Mr. <hi>Mowbray</hi> was the man that was by when it was diſcourſed.</p>

               <p>My Lord, in the new Coffee-Houſe that was by the Schools, that
was ſet up in the Parliament-time, there was a Gentleman that is in the Court (I think)
one Mr. <hi>Daſhwood,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Box</hi> were there together to drink a dish of Coffee, and
and hearing that ſome of the Evidence were there, we deſired their company up, and
that Gentleman was one; and among other Diſcourſe, they were ſpeaking of ſome
Pictures, and they shewed us the Picture of the Tantivies.</p>

in <hi>January, February</hi> and <hi>April</hi> laſt, ſeveral times I was in his company, and I heard
him ſay, he knew nothing of a Popish Plot, nor of a Presbyterian Plot neither, but if he

thing to get money.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Yes, I did hear him ſay, to day he would be a Papiſt, to morrow a
a Presbyterian, he did not care for Religion, he would never die for Religion, he would
be of that Religion that had the ſtrongeſt party. My Lord, he told me ſo at my own
Houſe in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mowbray.</speaker>
               <p>I came up from <hi>York</hi> with him when I returned, after I was commanded
down upon the Kings account to give in Evidence againſt Sir <hi>Miles Stapleton,</hi> he came
to me the third of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and called at my Houſe in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> and was very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
for me to come up to <hi>London</hi> with him, for he ſaid, he had a Letter come to
him which commanded his preſence at <hi>London</hi> very ſuddenly, and he produced that
Letter which he ſaid came from a Gentleman of the Court, or ſome Court dependent;
ſo he read the Letter in Mr. <hi>Bolrons</hi> hearing. We ſet forward on <hi>Sunday,</hi> and upon
our journey to <hi>London</hi> he told me he had ſomething of importance to impart to me,
ſo upon the Road he began to diſcourſe of the Parliament, and of the illegal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
and Arbitrary Power of the Two laſt Parliaments, he ſaid their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
were very illegal and arbitrary, and he began to open ſome of the Votes, as that
which they voted, that thoſe that should lend the King money upon the Crown
Lands, should be enemies to the King and Kingdom, and thoſe that counſelled
the King to diſſolve the Parliament; and he repeated many Votes; and, ſaid he, theſe
are ſigns of Arbitrary Power, and certainly they deſign to take off the King; ſo
he proceeded further, to ask me what was the Diſcourſe of Sir <hi>John Brooks</hi> when we
came up before, and he did much importune me to ſay, that Sir <hi>John Brooks</hi> did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
there would be cutting of throats at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and that the King was to be ſeized
there. I told him, I could have no plauſible pretence, becauſe I had no acquaintance
with Sir <hi>John Brooks,</hi> nor did I come up with him; upon which he applied himſelf
to Mr. <hi>Bolron,</hi> and importuned him for the ſame, he asked me who I came up
with, I told him, I came up with Three members of Parliament, my Lord <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax,</hi>
Sir <hi>John Hewly</hi> and Mr. <hi>Stern;</hi> he asked what Diſcourſe we had upon the
Road? And he asked, whether they had any Diſcourſe that tended to juſtifie
their former Votes? For he ſaid, if they did think to juſtifie any thing of
thoſe Votes, or if they would not allow the King money, and ſtood upon the
Bill of Excluſion, he ſaid, that was pretence enough for any man to ſwear
that there was a Deſign againſt the King, and that the King was to be ſeized at
<hi>Oxford.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>An excellent pretence indeed, and like the reſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mowbray.</speaker>
               <p>He would have tempted me to ſwear againſt my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> the
ſame. And he ſaid, it would be well if I did appear on <hi>Colledges</hi> Tryal at <hi>Oxon.</hi>
for it was a thing of great conſequence; the Popish Plot was thrown out of doors, and
no man was looked upon that did ſpeak of it.</p>

               <p>What day was the Tryal of Sir <hi>Miles Stapleton.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ser. jeff.</speaker>
               <p>You are ſure of that, and that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> went further into the North.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>But he did not come into the company of you and <hi>Bolron</hi> till the Sunday
after that.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mowb.</speaker>
               <p>See ye, Sir, He did deſire me to ſtay in the Countrey till he came, for he had
a buſineſs of great concernment to impart to me, but it would be a week or a fortnight
ere he came, but yet he came in a shorter time; for he ſaid he had received a Letter
that brought him up.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ser. jeff.</speaker>
               <p>You are ſure of this.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ser. jeff.</speaker>
               <p>And you did not ſee him from the Monday before, till that Sunday.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mowb.</speaker>
               <p>No, no.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ser. jeff.</speaker>
               <p>Now then, I ask you where was that place that he met with you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mowbray.</speaker>
               <p>At <hi>Wentbridge.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ser. jeff.</speaker>
               <p>And then you came from thence towards <hi>London</hi> the next day.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mow.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ser. jeff.</speaker>
               <p>Now would I deſire to know of you, for I perceive he did attack you to
ſay ſomething againſt Sir <hi>John Brooks,</hi> and finding that you could not do it, becauſe
you had no acquaintance, he applied himſelf to <hi>Bolron.</hi> I would know, was it between
that place and <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ser. jeff.</speaker>
               <p>And after the third of <hi>Auguſt.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mowb.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, it was after we ſet out.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ser. jeff.</speaker>
               <p>I thought it had been the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>July</hi> that you ſet out, and continued
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:31349:47"/>
your journey the 25, 26, 27, 28, and <hi>29th.</hi> Alas, we have loſt a great deal of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

and you are gotten to the third of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> you are miſtaken certainly, as to point of

            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>See, Sir, <hi>I</hi> will look in my Almanack, 'tis all ſet down there.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ser. jeff.</speaker>
               <p>Let us ſee now if your <hi>Oxford</hi> journey be as well ſet down, as your jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney

               <speaker>Ser. jeff.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> I don't care for his Almanack, <hi>I</hi> had rather <hi>Mowbray</hi> and
<hi>Bolron</hi> could bring their Almanacks together, and <hi>I</hi> would have them compared, to
ſee whether the third of <hi>Auguſt</hi> in one, be the <hi>25th.</hi> of <hi>July</hi> in the other. Did you
diſcourſe with him upon the road the third of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and not before; and <hi>Bolron</hi> that
came up with you, diſcourſe with him the <hi>25th.</hi> of <hi>July.</hi>

               <p>See, Sir, here is my Almanack, whereby. <hi>I</hi> find that it is my miſtake; but
pray ſee, Sir, here it is ſet down; the day we came out was the <hi>24th.</hi> the day we came

               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mowbray.</speaker>
               <p>I will refer my ſelf to <hi>Mr. Smith,</hi> as to the time we came up, and here is
my Almanack.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Ser. jeff.</speaker>
               <p>I will believe thy Almanack to ſpeak truth, though it have never ſo
many errors about the changes of the weather, ſooner than I will believe thee.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>

               <p>Look you, here is the matter, Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> he was asked again and again,
what day it was, and he was poſitive to the third of <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. c. j.</speaker>
               <p>You are a rash man to affirm ſo: if you had an Almanack, you should have
conſulted it, or referred to it.</p>

and that both himſelf and I were joyned as Evidence to that Jury, only to put a gloſs

               <p>My Lord, the Papiſts deſign is to make a Proteſtant Plot to turn off their own, and

they begin with me, but if I should go, they would not be ſatisfied with me, they would

               <p>My Lord, if there be no Presbyterian Proteſtant Plot, and others to joyn in
it, how could I do it by my ſelf; 'tis imposſible I should have ſuch a deſign of ſeizing the

               <p>My Lord, I deſire to know what he knows of theſe things, and that he may

               <p>But this he ſaid, if the Court will allow me to ſpeak it; Juſtice <hi>VVarcupp</hi>
ſaid, that certainly there was a Presbyterian Plot, and ſuch things; and that ſome Lords,
ſome of the Proteſtant proteſting Lords muſt be guilty of it, and ſaid he, certainly you
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:31349:49"/>
know much of it, You know ſuch and ſuch things, therefore you may ſafely ſwear it, if
I knew it; ſo by argument he would firſt prove there was a Plot and combination a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
thoſe Lords, and then ſaid he this you may ſafely ſwear.</p>

               <p>Concerning <hi>Mr. Haynes,</hi> he told me it was neceſſity that drove him to
ſpeak any thing againſt the Proteſtants, and the hard Pay and the Gratitude he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from the Citizens.</p>
            </sp>
            <stage>Then Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> acquainted the Court that <hi>Mr. Warcup</hi> was juſt come in, and

               <p>About three weeks ago. I asked him, Mr. <hi>Haynes,</hi> ſaid I, I would not
draw you from your Teſtimony in any thing; but how can this be congruous to what
you have ſaid formerly, That you knew nothing by them? The truth is, ſaid he, I
will not ſay much to excuſe my ſelf, but my Wife was reduced to that neceſſity, that
she begg'd at <hi>Rouſe</hi>'s door, and craved ſome Salary, and Mr. <hi>Rouſe</hi> would not give her
any; and, ſaid he, meer neceſſity drove me to it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>

               </speaker>
               <p>And, ſays he, 'tis Self-preſervation in the next place: for I was brought
in guilty when I was taken up, and therefore I was obliged to do ſome things to ſave
my Life.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, my Lord, and Gentlemen, obſerve what this Gentleman ſays, <hi>Haynes</hi>
takes this courſe to deſtroy innocent perſons for his own preſervation.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Beſides, he told me, there is a Judgment impending upon the Nation,
ſaid he, either upon the King, or upon the people, I know not which; but theſe <hi>Iriſh</hi>
mens ſwearing againſt them, is juſtly fallen upon them for their Injuſtice againſt the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> in outing them of their Eſtates.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>So he did it then by way of revenge. For his Country-men, I have nothing of
their Eſtates, I am ſure; therefore they had no cauſe to ſwear againſt me. But, <hi>Mr.

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Parkhurſt.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, the latter end of the laſt <hi>November,</hi> when the Parliament ſat at
<hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> ſeveral times Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> having promiſed me his further Narrative to
publish, which he printed, I met him ſeveral times; one time I met him at <hi>Richard</hi>'s
Coffee-Houſe, and it was towards the evening before we went away; he told me and
Mr. <hi>Symonds,</hi> that he was to ſpeak with Dr. <hi>Tongue;</hi> and he told us, that this Dr.
<hi>Tongue</hi> did lie at Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi>'s; and he having ſpoken the day before, and ſeveral
times, of the danger he was in of his being aſſaſſinated by the Papiſts, M. <hi>Symonds</hi> and I
offered to go with him, we took a coach; for we did not know where Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi>
lived: he had then a Rheum in his Eyes, and was not well; ſo we accompanied him
to Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi>'s to speak with Dr. <hi>Tongue.</hi> It was evening when we went; and
whilſt we took a pipe of Tobacco, in our diſcourſe we were ſpeaking of the times, and
of the danger of the Papiſts; ſo <hi>Colledge</hi> took down a ſteel Hat that hung up there,
which he ſaid he had, and he ſaid he had a quilted Coat of defenſive Armour, and he ſaid
he had a Blunderbuſs in his Houſe, and two Piſtols. But I little thought of any thing
of this, neither did I know well what I was <hi>ſubpoena'd</hi> down for: But theſe Arms I
ſaw in his Houſe, and it was only in diſcourſe that he was provided againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts;
ſo I put the ſteel Hat upon my Head and pulled it off again, and ſo did Mr.
<hi>Symonds.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>Did I ſay any thing, Sir, who I had thoſe Arms againſt?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Parkhurſt.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>At that time there was no diſcourſe in the world, but of the danger
from the Papiſts; and he ſaid he was provided for them, if they did come to make any
diſturbance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>When was it, Sir?</p>

               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Parkhurſt.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>It was about the latter end of <hi>November.</hi> I have the Narrative
that I printed, which was the <hi>23th</hi> or <hi>24th;</hi> and I have no directions but that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the time. So we carried Mr. <hi>Dugdale.</hi> home again in a Coach and gave him
a pint of Wine at his Lodgings.</p>

               <p>I can ſay the ſame that Mr. <hi>Parkhurſt</hi> did; that I ſuppoſe is the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.
All I know of it is this: I was with Mr. <hi>Parkhurſt</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> at <hi>Richards</hi>
Coffee-Houſe ſome time in <hi>November,</hi> I think it was about the printing of Mr. <hi>Dugdales</hi>
further Information; and Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was ſaying Dr. <hi>Tongue</hi> had ſent for him, but
ſpoke as if he was fearful of ſome danger in going alone; ſo we proffered to go along
with him, and we took a coach at the Coffee-Houſe-door, and went with him to Dr.
<hi>Tongue,</hi> who lodged at Mr. <hi>Colledges.</hi> When we came into the Room, Mr. <hi>Parkhurſt</hi>
and I thought fit we should in civility withdraw, which we did; and Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi>
brought us down into another Room, where we ſat and took a pipe of Tobacco, and
talking about the common diſcourſe of the times, about the Papiſts and the danger
from them, there hung up in Mr. <hi>Colledges</hi> Room ſome Arms; what they were, I dare
not charge my memory with to ſwear particularly, but I do think there was a Silk coat
of mail, and there was a cap of ſteel, and, as I take it, it was covered with cloth or ſome
ſuch thing; what elſe I can't well ſay: I think there was a Blunderbuſs and a caſe of
Piſtols: And all the diſcourſe that I remember then, was only this; Speaking of the
Papiſts, and ſome fears as if there would be an Inſurrection amongſt them, ſaid he, Let
the Papiſt Rogues begin when they will, I am ready to defend my ſelf for one. This
is all I know.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Symonds.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot tell exactly when it was; but during the Seſſion of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I am ſure it was, and as I take it, in <hi>November</hi> the latter end.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Pray, Sir, what do you know concerning <hi>Dugdale?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Yates.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I know that Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſent for me to a Coffee-Houſe to beſpeak a
Piſtol for you, and told me that when I had made the Piſtol, I should deliver it to <hi>Mr.
Colledge.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> promiſed to pay for it when I had done it. Now ſome
time after I did ſome ſmall matter for Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> cleaned his Piſtols, or ſome ſmall
buſineſs; and Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> asked me if I would drink a pint of Wine, which I agreed
to; and being at the Tavern, Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> asked me if <hi>Mr. Colledges</hi> Piſtol were done.
I told him no, it was not as yet. So I asked <hi>Mr. Dugdale,</hi> becauſe he had promiſed to give
Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> a Piſtol, what obligation there was betwixt Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> and him, that he
should give him a Piſtol? to which he anſwered, that Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> had been ſerviceable
to him in lending him a pair of Piſtols to ride withal ſometimes. So he gave him a Piſtol
to ſatisfie him for the wearing of his Piſtols now and then. I thought, ſaid I, Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
did impoſe upon your good nature too much, not but that I believe Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:31349:50"/>
is a very honeſt man, and ſtands up for the good of the King and the Government.
Yes, ſaid Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> I believe he does, and I know nothing to the contrary.</p>

I know not of them. <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſays I owned them, and the Letter and ſeveral Prints; but,
my Lord, I had done my ſelf a great injury if I had done or owned thoſe things he hath
charged me withal. I never could make a Picture, nor never did draw a Picture in my

               <p>My Lord, she came to me for money, I told her I had it not ready, but
would pay her; and in the Shop, before the Apprentice boy, she deſired of me that I
would write two or three words what I had to ſay againſt her Maſter, and I told Mr.
<hi>Graham</hi> of it. So, ſaid I, I cannot tell, I have not the papers, nor what informations
I have given againſt him. So she came again the next morning, and she was at me to
write down what I ſaid. I wonder, ſaid I, your Maſter will ſend you! had not he as
good ſend Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> who is his counſel? And this was all the words we had.</p>

               <p>I did tell him, <hi>Mr. Dugdale,</hi> if you can't let me have my Maſters money,
if you pleaſe to tell me what you have made Oath againſt my Maſter. Said he, I can't
let thee have it now, but thou shalt have what I have to ſay againſt him; I will draw
it up in writing, and thou shalt have it to morrow-morning. The next morning I
came to him again, and, ſaid I, I am come again, what muſt I do? Said he, I have no
money, ſuch an one hath not hoped me to it. Sir, then ſaid I, <hi>I</hi> hope you will be as
good as your word, to let me know what you have made Oath againſt my Maſter. Said
he, I was about it yeſterday, but could not do it: But, Sweetheart, ſaid he, (and took
me by the hand) <hi>I</hi> will give you a copy of it to day at ten of the clock; and if <hi>I</hi> do not,
<hi>I</hi> will tell it thee by word of mouth. So <hi>I</hi> came to the Houſe at ten, and ſtaid till ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,

               <p>Yes, I do. The Saturday after my Brothers confinement, about
eight of the clock in the morning, I having heard of it, came into the Houſe, and in a
quarter of an hours time in comes a Waterman, and deſires an handful or two of sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings.
I knowing not who he was, nor what he deſired them for, told him he should
have them; ſo he went up to the working-shop togather them, for he pretended that
to be his buſineſs.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Yes, it was the Saturday after. So no ſooner had he the shavings,
but he goes out of the Shop, and comes in again with three of his Majesties Meſſengers,
and they made enquiry after papers, and I being innocent of concealing any papers, or
any thing, ſaid <hi>I</hi> knew of none; ſo they came to one box that had the Tools for the
men to work with, and they demanded the keys: <hi>I</hi> told him, I knew not where the
keys were: So they went to the next, and found it open, but nothing did they find
there; there was a Bed wherein formerly my Brother's Servants did lye. Said one to
the other, look well whether there be not ſomething hid in that bed; ſaid I, <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe
there is no ſuch thing as you inquire for: if you pleaſe, you may take off the clothes,
and gave them free toleration to look; but for the cheſt, <hi>I</hi> would not deliver the
keys, becauſe the man was not there that owned it. In their ſearching they flung
down the Wainſcote, and did a great deal of damage to his Goods. Gentlemen, ſaid
I, <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe you have order to ſearch, but none to ſpoil a mans Goods. When they
were gone, having found none, they threatned, God dam them they would have
them, for there they were. But I being ignorant of the concealment of the papers,
I requeſted the Maid and my Brothers Son, whether they knew of any papers, and
they ſatisfied me they knew of ſome prints that were brought by a Porter, to be left at
my Brothers, but they knew not whence they came, nor what they were: and the
ſame anſwer gave my Brother's Son, that he did not know whoſe the papers were. But
ſince his Fathers confinement, they were laid up ſure and ſafe, for they knew not what
they concerned. Upon this, my Lord, my Brother in-law <hi>George Spur,</hi> he comes
into the Houſe, and if it pleaſe your Honour, I requeſted him to carry them into the
Countrey to his Houſe, to ſecure them till we knew what they did concern, and who
they did belong to. Whereupon he replied, my Lord, that he was fearful to carry
any thing out of the Houſe; ſaid I, if you will pleaſe to take them of me, <hi>I</hi> will
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:31349:55"/>
carry them out of the Houſe for your ſecurity, becauſe his Wife looked every hour (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with child) when she should be delivered, and he was fearful of troubling her. So
I carried them out of the Houſe, and delivered them to him.</p>

               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, <hi>I</hi> have only innocence to pleade; <hi>I</hi> have no Flourishes to ſet off
my Deſence. <hi>I</hi> cannot take the Jury nor the Court with an Oratory; <hi>I</hi> am unhappy
in thoſe things. But, my Lord, <hi>I</hi> do declare, as to my own particular, in the preſence
of God Almighty, that as to whatſoever is ſworn againſt me, as to the ſeizing his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
providing Arms, or having any Deſign either at <hi>Oxford</hi> or <hi>London,</hi> or any other
place in the world, to ſeize upon the perſon of the King, or to rebel againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
eſtablished; <hi>I</hi> vow to God Almighty, <hi>I</hi> never had ſuch a thought in me: 'tis a truth,
my Lord. My Lord, they have ſworn deſperately againſt me, and it hath appeared, <hi>I</hi>
think, by very credible perſons, that they have contradicted one another. It hath been
proved that it was a Deſign; that they were tampered withal; that they complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
they were in poverty, that they wanted maintenance; and they did confeſs they
were tempted to come over to ſwear againſt Proteſtants: and now the Lord knows they
have cloſed with it, and they begin with me. I hope the Jury have taken notice
that <hi>I</hi> have contradicted them ſufficiently in what they have ſworn; and that it is not
posſible, if <hi>I</hi> had a grain of ſence, for me to diſcover my ſelf to be ſuch an one to Haynes
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:31349:56"/>
that was an <hi>Irish-man,</hi> and ſhould ſpeak all the Treaſon that he hath galloped through
at firſt ſight, that as ſoon as ever I ſaw him, that I ſhould ſpeak ſo to him; I hope you
will conſider whether it conſiſts with common Reaſon, when there could be no proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of making any uſe of him in the world. My Lord, all my Witneſſes that I have
brought, your Lordship can, and I hope will ſum them up better than I can; for I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
it, I have been ſo concerned, that I have not been able to write half of it down.
But I think there is never a man that hath ſworn againſt me, but hath been ſufficiently
confuted by perſons of integrity and Honeſty, men of Principles, and men of Religion;
they are ſuch, my Lord, that make conſcience of what they ſay: they are perſons
altogether unknown to me, moſt of them, as to what they had to ſay; it was what
they offered voluntarily; and I am certain they have had nothing but their bare charges,
if they had that, for their pains in coming hither; and, my Lord, there is no probability
that they should come and atteſt any thing that is falſe, for me who am a ſtranger, for
nothing: No man is a Knave for nothing, as I believe theſe men are not. My Lord,
I do declare it, I was bred a Proteſtant, and I have lived ſo; I am ſo this very day;
I have been a lover of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and of all the fundamental points of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
believed in it; I own the ſame God, the ſame Saviour, the ſame Goſpel, and the
ſame Faith; I never had a prejudice againſt any man in the Church in my life, but ſuch
as have made it their buſineſs to promote the intereſt of the Papiſts, and ſuch I muſt beg
leave to ſay there are amongſt them: for there is no Society in the world without ſome
bad men; and theſe do promote the intereſt of the Papiſts, by dividing the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
and allowing none to be true Proteſtants, but thoſe that are within the Church of
<hi>England</hi> eſtabliſhed by Law; which is a Notion ſo wide I could never cloſe with that.
I never had a prejudice againſt any man but a Knave in my life. <hi>I</hi> have heard, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
ſome of the Diſſenters, and I have found very honeſt, juſt, pious, godly men among
them; men free from Oaths and all Debauchery; men that make a conſcience of what
they ſay: not like ſome perſons that ſay they are of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that carry
themſelves in their lives and actions, ſo as that no credit can be gained to the Church
by them. My Lord, I have been an hearty man againſt the Papiſts; <hi>I</hi> have been an
hearty man as any perſon of my condition for Parliaments, which I look upon to be my
Birth-right, and under God Almighty, the Bulwark of our Liberty; and I am ſorry if
any man ſhould be an inſtrument to create a miſunderſtanding betwixt the King and the
Parliament: for I always thought I ſerved my Country, when I ſerved the Parliament,
and I ſerved the King, when I ſerved my Country. I never made any difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, becauſe I thought them both one. I had the Honour to be entruſted by
them before, and upon that account I came voluntarily down hither. I rid my own
Horſe, I ſpent my own money, and eat my own Bread; I was not beholding to any
man for the value of ſix pence all the while I was here. My Lord, I have ever ſince
the Plot hath been diſcovered, endeavered with all my heart, and all my power, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dect
and come at the very bottom of it: I have ſpared for no time nor pains, what lay
fairly in my way, in every thing to encourage thoſe that diſcovered the Villanies of the
Popiſh Plot againſt the Life of the King, and for the Subverſion of the Religion and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:31349:57"/>
eſtabliſhed by Law. Now certainly it is not ſtrange to the world; for I think
all Chriſtendom is aware how plain the Popish Plot hath been proved. Theſe men that
ſwear againſt me, were they that uſed to follow me ſometimes; they would ſay, it was
they that had come to ſave our lives, and yet we let them want Bread. That argument,
my Lord, was ſo fair, that I thought it unreaſonable to ſee them ſtarve: And I have ſaid
ſometimes to ſome honeſt conſiderable men, that it was hard they should have this to ſay
of us, that they ſhould want Bread to eat that were the Kings Evidence, to detect a Popiſh
Plot wherein we our ſelves were concerned; and that when they had ſaved our blood in
our veins, they ſhould be ſuffered to ſtarve. And one time, I think, ſome three or four
Gentlemen of the City did give me <hi>42 s.</hi> or <hi>40 s.</hi> and <hi>8 d.</hi> or thereabouts; which I did
diſtribute amongſt them: And they never came to me in my life, but to ſeek relief, they
knowing that I had a general acquaintance. And ſometimes they thought it might be fit
to petition the Common Council of <hi>London</hi> to take care of them: Sometimes they would
ſpeak to particular men that care ſhould be taken of them. At other times indeed it was
not this ſort of diſcourſe they had with me; but they would pretend they had ſomething
to diſcover of the Popiſh Plot, and ſo they would apply to me as a man of ſome acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
And the firſt time I ſaw <hi>Haynes</hi> was upon ſuch an account, the beginning of
<hi>March</hi> laſt, and it was thus: I was at <hi>Richard</hi>'s Coffee-Houſe at <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> where
<hi>Macnamarra</hi> did deſire me to go out, and I ſhould hear ſuch a piece of Roguery I never
did hear in my life, againſt my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi> So I did go out with them, and I called
Captain <hi>Brown,</hi> who is ſince dead, to go with me; and we went to the <hi>Hercules</hi> Pillars,
and <hi>Haynes</hi> there diſcovered what I told your Lordship before, a deſign to deſtroy the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
at <hi>Oxford,</hi> an Army that was to land in the North, another in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the
Duke of <hi>York</hi> was to be at the head of them. My Lord, after I had heard all out, he did
deſire us all to conceal what he had ſaid till the Parliament ſat, and then he would not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcover this, but much more. He at the ſame time told us, that there was a deſign of
<hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi>'s againſt my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> to take away his life, and he was employed to
come to his Couſin <hi>Macnamarra</hi> to get him over to joyn in the deſign, and he should never
want for money, if he would but come over, and do as they would have him. After he had
diſcovered himſelf, Sir, ſaid I, you are a ſtranger to me, and I never ſaw him before in my
days, if he had ſeen me, I can't tell: But, Sir, ſaid I, either this is true, or this is falſe.
If it be true, ſaid he, 'tis all true, and much more. So he up and told us much of <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
and of the reconciliation between the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> and the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and
how he came to be Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and how Plunket came to be Primate, and
by means of whom, and the Letters that paſſed, and how ſo much a year was given to <hi>Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi>
for carrying on the correſpondence; and he told us ſo much, that I did wonder to hear
any man talk after that rate. After I had heard what he had to ſay, I told him, Sir,
ſaid I, this is either true or falſe that you have ſaid; if it be true, my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>
shall know it to night; for I will not conceal ſuch a thing concerning a Peer of the Realm:
and if it were a colour, he should know of it. And I did ſend him word that night; and,
ſaid I, Sir, you ought to go, for your own ſecurity and ours too, to ſwear it before a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate.
Said he, if I should, I should be diſcovered. Said I, I can't think you will be
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:31349:57"/>
diſcovered; if you ſwore it before Sir <hi>George Treby,</hi> or Sir <hi>Robert Clayton,</hi> they will
not diſcover you. So he agreed he would ſwear before Sir <hi>George</hi> Treby, and he did go
accordingly; but he being out of Town, I cannot have the Affidavit to produse it. There
was a Letter ſent laſt Saturday-night to Sir <hi>George</hi> to Briſtol, and I hoped he might have
been here to day. This was the firſt acquaintance I ever had with <hi>Haynes</hi> The next
time I heard of him, was upon this occaſion: <hi>Ivy</hi> comes to me in <hi>Richard</hi>'s Coffee-Houſe,
and, ſaid he, yonder is the man that made that diſcovery, which I told you before that
<hi>Haynes</hi> had ſaid to me; it was about a month or three weeks before the Parliament was
at <hi>Oxford.</hi> After the Parliament was diſſolved at <hi>Oxford, Ivy</hi> comes to me, and I think
it was betwixt the two Terms wherein <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was Arraigned and Tried: I know not
the names of them, but he comes to me and tells me he had been with my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi>
and that there was a friend of his that would confirm all that <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> had diſcovered
concerning the Murder of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey;</hi> and, ſays he, my Lord of <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
hath ſent me to you to acquaint you with it. Where is your friend, ſaid I? He is
without, ſaid he. So we went out of the Coffee-Houſe, and when we came out of doors,
there was this <hi>Haynes:</hi> we went to the <hi>Crown-Tavern</hi> without <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> it was in
the forenoon. When we came there into the room, he examined all the corners, and cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boards,
and places about the room, to ſee that no body was there. When he thought all was
ſecure, he began to tell me he had been to acquaint my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> that there was a
friend of his that would diſcover the whole Intrigue of the murder of Sir <hi>Edmundbury
Godfrey,</hi> all that <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> had ſaid, and much more: And he deſired me that I would
intreat my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> to be inſtrumental to get him his Pardon before he diſcover'd
particularly. Then I told him, I think 'tis convenient, ſaid I, that you diſcover ſomething
in writing, and give under your hand what you can ſay. He was not willing to do that.
Can you believe, ſaid I, that my Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> will betray you? Says he, I will not
truſt any body; I ſhall be aſſasſinated. Said I, if you will not give it to any body elſe,
will you give it to Mr. <hi>Michael Godfrey,</hi> Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi>'s Brother? you can
have no jealouſie of Him, that He will ever diſcover you: ſaid he, if my Lord <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
will engage to get me a Pardon, I will tell the whole truth: ſaid I, I will go to my
Lord and acquaint him: ſo I went to both my Lord and Mr. <hi>Godfrey,</hi> and Sir <hi>Edmund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury
Godfrey</hi>'s two Brothers both met me at my Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Houſe. This is the
thing that he tells me; he would have me get my Lord's Protection, and a Pardon for
Treaſon: But the real truth is, He ſent me upon this errand: ſo I came to my Lord
<hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and the two Mr. <hi>Godfreys</hi> were in the room; and after I had told my Lord
what diſcourſe I had with Him, ſays my Lord, <hi>Colledge,</hi> theſe <hi>Iriſh-men</hi> have confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
all our buſineſs; and thou and I muſt have a care they do not put a trick upon us; this
may be a trick of the Papiſts to ruine us; and if they have ſuch a deſign, if they will not
put it upon you and I, they are fools. Upon your Lordſhip, ſaid I, they may; but <hi>I</hi> am a
poor inconſiderable fellow. Says my Lord, I'll tell you, Mr. <hi>Godfrey;</hi> Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi>
hath not only been an Honeſt man, but a uſeful and an active man for the Proteſtant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.
So I told my Lord how far I had gone with Him, and that I deſired it might be
put in writing: ſays my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> if he will put it in writing, <hi>I</hi> will go once again,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:31349:58"/>
for I have been ſince I ſaw the fellow, with my Lord <hi>Macclesfield,</hi> and my Lord Chief
Juſtice <hi>Pemberton,</hi> and my Lord Chancellor, and I have told them that there is ſuch a
perſon in general, but I knew not the man, as indeed my Lord did not; for only <hi>Ivy</hi> was
the perſon between them that my Lord knew: And I told them, ſays my Lord, that he can
confirm all that <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> has ſaid concerning the death of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi>
and that he would prove my Lord of <hi>Danby</hi> was in it, if he might have his pardon; and
my Lord ſaid, they promiſed to ſpeak to his Majeſty that it might be granted. But ſome
time the latter end of the week I heard it would not be granted; and both of theſe men
followed me to know what they ſhould do. Said I, my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> knows not but that
it may be a trick; and, ſaid I to <hi>Ivy,</hi> I wonder why he should conceal it all this while, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a necesſitous man, and <hi>500 l.</hi> proffered by the King in his Proclamation. Why, ſays
<hi>Ivy,</hi> do you think there is no truth in it? ſays I, 'tis not my judgment, but my Lord <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Godfrey</hi>'s judgment too. He anſwered me again, <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
he may have a pardon granted for himſelf and a <hi>French-man;</hi> and if ſo be there were
nothing in it, do you think he would move for a pardon? Says I, did Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>
move for <hi>Haynes</hi>'s pardon? How do I know that, ſays <hi>Ivy</hi> again: <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>'s Wife
told me ſo. Says I, let me ſpeak with <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>'s Wife, let me hear her ſay ſo, and I
will believe you. The next day he did bring her to me to my Houſe; and this was the
time and the occaſion that brought <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>'s VVife, and <hi>Haynes,</hi> and <hi>Ivy,</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>'s maid to my Houſe; and I never ſaw <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> in my days till his Tryal,
nor had any communication with him. But, my Lord, ſhe did talk with <hi>Haynes,</hi> and
confirmed it to me, that her Husband had deſired a pardon for him: why then, ſaid I, he
would do well to diſcover what he knows to my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury;</hi> for I was with my
Lord, and he ſays he will meddle no more, unleſs he will give it under his hand what he
has to ſay: And he did confeſs to me in my own yard, for there we were together, that he
ſaw my Lord of <hi>Danby</hi> come into the Chappel at <hi>Sommerſet-Houſe,</hi> when the body of
Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> lay under the Altar.</p>

               <p>You may obſerve what you will upon the Evidence, as we told you; but
you ramble from the matter you are to ſpeak to. And as we told Mr. Attorney, that
what he ſaid should go for nothing, unleſs he made it out by proof; ſo muſt we ſay to
you, what you ſay goes for nothing, further than you have proved it. Now you have
quitted the proof quite, and not ſpoke to that, but run into other ſtories. I would
have you keep your ſelf to your proofs, and make your obſervations upon them.</p>

               <p>Truth! Why if yours, or any mans word in your caſe, should go for truth,
no man that ſtands at a Bar could be convicted; for every man will ſay he is an honeſt
man, and all the plauſible things in the world. Make you your obſervations upon the
proof that is proper for you to do; and urge it as well as you can, and to the beſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

his Oath? Have you proved one jot of it? not that I have heard. 'Tis your part to
ſum up the Evidence on your own ſide, and to anſwer that which is proved upon you,
if you can. Do that, and we will hear you ſpeak to it as long as you can. But to
tell ſtories to amuſe the Jury with that are not proved, and to run out into rambling

you found fault with Mr. Attorney at the beginning for opening the Evidence, and you
were told, and the Jury were told at your requeſt, that what he ſaid, and did not prove,
paſſed for nothing. But I muſt tell you, 'tis much worſe in your caſe: for Mr. Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
only opened what he might prove afterwards, but your obſervations are upon
what hath been proved already; and yet you run out into ſtories of what hath not been

that every one of my Witneſſes have ſpoken materially to contradict what they have ſaid,
to prove that this was done for money, and that there hath been confesſions from every
man of them; that they were hired to do it; that they did it for a livelyhood; and one
of them ſaid; It was a good Trade, dam him, he would do any thing for money: And
I hope then you will conſider the improbability, that I ſhould ſpeak to an Iriſhman who I
had never ſeen before in my life; and that I ſhould at the firſt daſh utter all that Treaſon
that he gives in Evidence, I think it cannot conſiſt with any mans underſtanding to believe

               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>As to <hi>Smith</hi> now I ſuppoſe it does not come within the reach of the Statute;
for the Dinner that was made by Alderman <hi>Wilcox</hi> was made before laſt <hi>July</hi> was twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>month;
all the Witneſſes do ſay it was before <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſays it was in the
Summer; I know it by a very good obſervation, becauſe I went to <hi>Aſtrop</hi> Waters after
that, and I ſaw Sir <hi>Creſwell Levinz</hi> at the <hi>Wells:</hi> Now <hi>Sir</hi> you were there before this
time twelvemonth. So then whatever he ſays I ſaid to him there, I cannot be charged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
by the Statute, more or leſs, if I had never a Witneſs againſt him; but I have Witneſſes
that have contradicted him ſufficiently, that he is forſworn in that; and if ſo, he is not to be
believed in any thing elſe; for he ſays, He &amp; I went to the <hi>Coffee-Houſe</hi> together, and we
diſcourſed ſuch and ſuch things, which is not above half a Bows ſhoot, and he made it I
ſay a quarter of a miles diſcourſe; if I had had all the talk, the diſcourſe could not be ſo
long, tho' he had ſaid never a word: ſo you ſee what a kind of Witneſs he is. And Dr.
<hi>Oates</hi>'s Brother did ſay, that I did go along with Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and offered to be one of his
Guard, and I did ſo, and went along with them, but Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> he came after. And
as to what he ſays he is ſufficiently confuted, that is, about the going into Cabals after
Dinner; for it is proved, that I fell aſleep behind the Table, and Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing
with Mr. <hi>Savage</hi> upon points of Divinity; but I took no notice of it, neither did
I ſee <hi>Smith</hi> any more, but he went away, and ſo did the reſt of the company. But, my
Lord, when <hi>Haynes</hi> was taken, <hi>Smith</hi> comes to me that day to my Houſe at the <hi>Ditch-ſide,</hi>
and ſends in a man for me, his man; I was writing in my Parlour, and drawing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
for Wainſcoting <hi>Alhallows</hi> Church, a Platform for it; his man told me, His Maſter
would ſpeak with me, and <hi>Haynes</hi> was taken that morning: But as I underſtand ſince, it
was by agreement and his own conſent, tho' he hath pretended otherwiſe. You hear,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:31349:60"/>
ſays he, <hi>Haynes</hi> is taken? Yes, ſays I, I do, he hath been ever ſince 9 a clock before the
Secretary upon examination, and he was till 5 a clock at night examining: ſaid he, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he confeſſes a great deal: Said I, of what? Said he, of ſome deſign of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants:
Said I, what, againſt the Government? I do not know what they may affright
him into; He is a great Rogue if it be true all that he hath ſaid of himſelf: He ſays he
was concerned in the Fire of <hi>London,</hi> and knew of a deſign to deſtroy the Proteſtants
then; of a Rebellion that was to be in <hi>Ireland;</hi> of <hi>Plunket</hi>'s being made Primate, and a
great many of thoſe things: So that if he ſpeaks truth, he hath been a great Rogue, and
as he hath pretended alſo, he was a great coward. So then I believe he may ſay any
thing to excuſe himſelf: Says Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> I wiſh you are ſafe. This was the very night
before I was taken.</p>

had me run away. Said he, I believe you are not ſafe, I would have you take care of
your ſelf, for you were concerned with him. Now, my Lord, if I had been a guilty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
I had time enough to get away; and to prove this, I can only ſay this was betwixt
him and I. But, my Lord, you hear Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſays, that this very <hi>Smith</hi> did ſwear he
would hare my blood, and that was upon this occaſion of my vindicating <hi>Sampſon,</hi> whom
he had ſtruck and abuſed; and I asked why he did it? Said he, I value no mans life, if
he affront me, if 'tis any man in <hi>England,</hi> I value him not. My Lord, upon this occaſion
the words riſe between us; and when he came out of doors, and was going away Dr.
<hi>Oates</hi> ſaid, He ſwore he would have my blood, and that was the occaſion of his ſpeaking
that Blaſphemy.</p>

him my Arms, which I have had for any time almoſt theſe three years, ever ſince the Plot
brake out. I have been armed ready to oppoſe the Papiſts, and I did my duty in the City
in perſon in the Trained-Bands, but <hi>Smith</hi> ſays theſe Arms were to deſtroy the Kings
Guards, but he does not prove that I was confederate with any other perſon, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of that there were other perſons that ſay with his own mouth, that he did not believe
there was any Proteſtant Plot; nay, he did believe I ſaid it only in wantonneſs. This is all,
then how probable was it, that I my ſelf should ſeize the King, or deſtroy his Guards.</p>

did ſay the Parliament cut off the late Kings Head. We held a diſpute upon that which <hi>I</hi>
was not willing to enter into; <hi>I</hi> ſaid they did not, and we did then diſpute whether they
began the War againſt His Majeſty: <hi>I</hi> ſaid they did not that <hi>I</hi> knew of, neither were they
the perſons, but the Papiſts that began that War, and that broke off the Ereaty at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi>
and that the Papiſts carryed it on to that ſad iſſue, and put it upon the Proteſtants, that
they had the <hi>odium</hi> of it, but it was another ſort of men that carryed it on. I ſaid that I
did always underſtand that Parliament to be an honeſt Parliament, that minded the true
intereſt of the Nation, and much of the ſame opinion with the Parliament that ſate laſt
at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> But before I ſaid this, I ſaid they were perſons altogether innocent of
the Kings murder, and raiſing the War againſt the King, I did always underſtand that ſo
the Parliament in 40 were.</p>

               <p>Yes, my Lord, <hi>I</hi> take it upon that Statute.</p>

               <speaker>L. c. j.</speaker>
               <p>I tell you, as to that part of the Statute which concerns Miſdemeanors, there
is a particular clauſe for proſecution, by order of King or Council; but as to that part
of the Statute that concerns Treaſon, it muſt be proſecuted within ſix months, and
the Indictment within three months after.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. c. j.</speaker>
               <p>Upon the Statute of the 25 of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. which declares the Common-Law,
and the Statute of the 13. of this King, which when you have done, I will have read
to the Jury.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>Then pray, my Lord, let me ask you one queſtion; whether the Statute of the

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. juſt. <hi>jones.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>No, but there is another that does.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>I am ignorant of the Law, and therefore <hi>I</hi> ask the queſtion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. c. j.</speaker>
               <p>Well, I will tell you, there muſt be two witneſſes in the caſe, but one
witneſs to one fact at one time, and another witneſs to another fact at another time,
will be ſufficient Evidence to maintain an Indictment of Treaſon; this was told you
in the morning.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. juſt. <hi>jones.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>They proved fact in that caſe, writing of Letters, and offering money to kill the
King; but nothing of fact is proved againſt me, but riding into the Countrey with Arms
that I had three years before.</p>

               <p>We told you our opinion before, that one witneſs to one fact, and another
to another of the ſame Treaſon, was ſufficient. We are upon our Oaths in it, and
ſpeak not our own opinions, but what hath received publick reſolution in caſes of the

               <p>VVhat lies before theſe Gentlemen of the Jury, as done at <hi>Oxon.</hi> 'tis but upon

               <p>Nay, Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> and Mr. <hi>Turbervile</hi> both ſwear the ſame thing,
your deſign to ſeize the King at <hi>Oxon.</hi> And it would be the difficulteſt thing in the
world to prove Treaſon againſt any man, if the Law were not ſo, and a man might
commit all ſorts of Treaſon ſecurely; for to be ſure he would never ſay the ſame things
before two witneſſes in one time, and the King would be in no ſort ſafe; for there would
never be two witneſſes to one and the ſame thing: but that hath been reſolved often and
often, over and over again, particularly in my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>'s caſe, as you have been told.</p>

               <p>I ſay the thing hath been conſidered in other caſes, and the Law hath
been adjudged and ſetled. It was ſo reſolved in my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>'s caſe, when the
Judges, by the command of the Parliament did deliver their opinion upon that point
moved by him.</p>

            <sp>

of theſe men are altogether invalidated, by ſubſtantial perſons that have here teſtified
againſt them. I do declare upon my ſalvation, (I have nothing elſe to ſay) I am wholly
innocent, and the Jury are my Judges; and I beſeech them, as they will anſwer me at
the great day of Judgment, where they muſt appear as ſure as I ſtand at this Bar now,
that they do me right, and go according to their own conſciences; for if a man ſhall be
ſworn againſt by ſuch fellows as theſe are, no man is ſafe.</p>

               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>I am ſure it cannot be thought by men of common reaſon, that I ſhould ſpeak
Treaſon at that rate that they have ſworn, and to ſuch men, men of their profesſion, <hi>Irish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
and Papiſts, Traytors, that have declared they have been in all manner of Rogueries,
Murders, Plots, and Treaſons. Therefore, my Lord, I cannot do any more for my ſelf,
becauſe I have no notes, and cannot recite what hath been ſaid for me, or againſt me, but
I do depend upon your Lordſhip, and I hope you will inform the Jury rightly, and do me
juſtice; and I do pray the Jury that they let their conſciences be ſatisfied, as they are
<hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> and as they are Chriſtians, to conſider how the caſe lyes with me, whether
there has not been more occaſion of talking of late, and whether a ſlip of the tongue may
be called a premeditated, malicious, adviſed ſpeaking, I mean my diſcourſe with Mr. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</hi>
He talked with me as hot as fire, he was ſo violent, and I did diſcourſe him at that
rate I have told you, and that is truth, as I have a Soul to be ſaved: I did excuſe the
Parliament, that as I underſtood it, they had no hand in the beginning of the War, or the
murder of the King. My Lord, as for the reſt that have ſworn againſt me ſo deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I muſt ſay, that if the Jury did not as well conſider my Evidence as theirs, yet they
might well conſider, whether it conſiſts with common ſenſe and reaſon, that I ſhould ſpeak
to theſe men after this rate, when I could lay no obligation upon them, nor have any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in them; necesſitous perſons, that could not asſiſt me one mite, men that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
to me to borrow money of me, and that eat of my coſt, that I had always been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
to, and not they to me. But I hope I need inſiſt upon this no further, the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is ſenſible what is doing, and what this does ſignifie: They have begun with me, in
order to the making of a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Plot, which they would carry on to ſtifle the noiſe of
the Popish Plot; and this is not the 1ſt, the 2d. nor the 10th. time that they have been
at this Game; how many Shams have they endeavoured to raiſe—</p>

               <p>My Lord, I only deſire the Jury to take all into their ſerious conſideration;
I expect a ſtorm of thunder from the learned Counſel to fall upon me, who have liberty
to ſpeak, and being learned in the Law, underſtand theſe things better than I, who muſt
defend my ſelf without counſel. I know not whether it be the practice in any Nation, but
certainly 'tis hard meaſure, that I being illiterate and ignorant in the Law, muſt ſtand here
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:31349:64"/>
all day, they being many, and taking all advantages againſt me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I a ſingle perſon, and
not able to uſe one means or other either of writing or ſpeaking. But Gentlemen, I do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
and proteſt, as I ſhall anſwer it at the day of judgment, that as to what theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
have ſworn againſt me either as to words, or as to any manner of Treaſon againſt the
King, the Government, the Laws eſtabliſhed, I take God to witneſs I am as innocent as
any perſon upon earth. And therefore I muſt beſeech you be not frightened nor flattered,
do according to your judgments and your conſciences; you are to be my Judges both in
Law and Fact; you are to acquit me, or to condemn me, and my blood will be required at
your hands. And whatſoever is ſaid to you by others, you are my true Judges, you muſt
give an account of the Verdict you give; and therefore you muſt ſee that you do Juſtice,
as you will anſwer it at another Bar, where you muſt all certainly appear, and the Lord
Almighty direct you that you do me true juſtice, and I ask no more.</p>

hath been a great deal of time ſpent, and truly I think for no other reaſon but to divert
you from the matter that is before you, and that you might forget the Evidence that
hath been given. And therefore I will briefly repeat it to you, that I may refresh your
memories about what hath been ſworn. Gentlemen, the Crime charged upon Mr.
<hi>Colledge</hi> is High-Treaſon, in imagining and compaſſing the death of the King; the
proof of that hath been by a conſpiracy to ſeize the King here at <hi>Oxon.</hi> which conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
he declared he was in, by shewing Arms prepared for that purpoſe, and by coming
down to <hi>Oxon.</hi> with that intent; this is the proof of his deſign to kill the King.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>Is the conſpiracy proved of that Mr. Solicitor?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. c. j.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Colledge.</hi> We have had a great deal of patience with you, you have
ſpent a great deal of time, you muſt contain your ſelf now, and let them go on.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. c. j.</speaker>
               <p>Look you, Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> you have taken up a great deal of time, and we
have had much patience, becauſe we conſider your condition, and had rather hear too
much than be hard upon you; and becauſe the Evidence was long and difficult to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat,
now we have heard you, you muſt have patience to hear what the King's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
repeat, and obſerve upon it.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>As I was ſaying the fact that is charged upon him, is a deſign to kill the
King, the manifeſtation of that deſign is by preparing Arms to that purpoſe, and by
coming down to <hi>Oxon.</hi> to ſeize the King here, and that this was his manifeſt intent to
ſeize the King, the proof of it hath been by witneſſes, that I think by and by you will
have no objections againſt. Theſe witneſſes were <hi>Dugdale, Turbervile, Smith</hi> and
<hi>Haynes,</hi> theſe are the moſt material witneſſes to the Treaſon; there are two other wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
indeed, but they are to other circumſtantial matters that I will take notice of to
you by and by, and make my obſervations upon them in their proper place.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was the firſt witneſs that was produced, and his Evidence is very full,
he proves that Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> declared to him at the Coffee-houſe here, that he was come
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:31349:65"/>
down with an intent to ſeize the King, that he had an expectation ſomething would
be done, that he was armed, and that he did adviſe Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> to be armed too, for
he was provided for the rooting out of Popery, which he explained himſelf what he
meant by it, that was the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the King and all his Adherents. He
came hither armed for that purpoſe Gentlemen, and did adviſe Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> to arm
himſelf too, that he did declare to him the King was a Papiſt, and all his Family were
Papiſts, He was as deep in the Plot, and as guilty of the Murder of Sir <hi>Edmundbury
Godfrey</hi> as any body elſe. This was what he declared to <hi>Dugdale</hi>
here, and this he
ſwore to you when he gave his Evidence.</p>
               <p>The next Witneſs is Mr. <hi>Turbervile,</hi> and he is poſitive to the matter that is laid in the
Indictment, and ſwears to you expreſly, that he did declare to him at the <hi>Chequer</hi>-Inn,
that they came down here in expectation of ſome ſport, that ſomething would be done,
that they did expect the King would begin with them, but if they did not, they would
begin with him, and they would ſecure him till they had brought him to a complyance.
He shewed him his Arms, that he was ready to ingage in that deſign, and adviſed <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bervile</hi>
to be ready too. And the rather than <hi>Turbervile</hi> should not be ready, he offered
to procure him an Horſe.</p>

that time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>But every one had them not with the ſame intent, but Gentlemen,
becauſe Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> interrupts me with an Objection, I will take notice of it now by
the way. He ſays thoſe Arms he had before, and therefore they were not provided for
this purpoſe, Gentlemen, we do not pretend to prove when his trayterous intent firſt
began, and how long this Deſign has been hatching, but ſuch a Deſign there was, and
ſuch a Deſign he manifeſted to be in himſelf when he made the Declaration to <hi>Turber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile,</hi>
and adviſed him to arm himſelf, whether he prepared them againſt that time or no
is not material, if he had them before, and if he had them firſt innocently, yet if he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
deſigned them for ſuch a purpoſe, and shewed them in a readineſs for it, that
is a ſufficient Evidence to prove this Treaſon.</p>
               <p>So here are two Witneſſes you obſerve againſt the Priſoner of this matter that is laid
againſt him in the Indictment, an intent to kill the King, they both prove it poſitively
upon him at <hi>Oxon.</hi> Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſpeaks to matters precedent to, for he tells you, his
diſcourſe before they came down, that they would come down for that purpoſe, that
they had an expectation ſomething would be done, and therefore he came down in an
Equipage not ſuitable to his profeſſion, for you ſee he was by Trade a Carpenter or a
Joyner, but armed on Horſeback with a caſe of Piſtols, things that don't become ſuch
men to travel with, and he did declare to Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> for what purpoſe he came down.
The next Witneſs is Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> is as poſitive and full to this matter of
Treaſon as any of the reſt.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>He tells you of a diſcourſe as he came from the Coffee-Houſe to go
to a Dinner whither he was invited by Alderman <hi>Wilcox;</hi> and the diſcourſe was, that
the King was as great a Papiſt as the Duke, and much more to that purpoſe vilifying the
King. The Alderman <hi>Wilcox</hi> was a man that gave money to buy Arms to bring the
King to ſubmiſſion. He objects againſt this, and ſays, 'tis impoſſible ſuch a diſcourſe
should be, and that all this should be talked in ſo little a time, as in paſſing from the Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee-Houſe
to the <hi>Crown</hi> Tavern without <hi>Temple-Bar.</hi>
               </p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>But Gentlemen, when you conſider, how buſie a man he was, and
how ready at talking of Treaſon, you will not think, but that this man might talk much
more than this; but this I mention to do him right, it being one of the Arguments he
uſed; and to give an anſwer to it, tho' when you conſider it, I believe you will think it
not to need an Anſwer. But I would do him all the right I can, and now you have
heard it, you will conſider the weight of it.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, he tells you of another diſcourſe afterwards that does relate to his being
here at <hi>Oxon.</hi> he tells you he had Arms in his Houſe, and was ready upon all occaſions,
and he shew'd Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> his Arms, and told him, theſe were the things that were to
deſtroy <hi>Rowley</hi>'s Guards, as he ſaid, which by the Evidence is made to appear he meant
the King by that name, his Arms he ſaid were for that purpoſe. That he would go
down to <hi>Oxon.</hi> and there he expected ſome ſport, I know not what ſport he thinks
there is in Rebellion; you ſee what principles he is of, that does maintain and juſtifie
the greateſt and horrid'ſt Rebellion that ever was in <hi>England,</hi> and ſays they did nothing
but what they had good cauſe for. He tells <hi>Smith</hi> that he thought the King would ſeize
upon ſome Members, and with that expectation he came down, but he was as ready as
the King, and would be one in the ſecuring of him, if he medled with any of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
This proof Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> made; and that after the Parliament was diſſolved, he ſaid
that the King ran away, and was very much afraid. This is proved by <hi>Smith</hi> likewiſe,
and this <hi>Colledge</hi> did declare after he came to Town. <hi>Smith</hi> proves further, that he did
wonder the King did not conſider how eaſily his Fathers Head was brought to the
Block; and for Mr. <hi>Colledges</hi> part he did declare, that he did believe this King would be
ſerved ſo shortly. And this does confirm what his other Witneſſes have ſpoken of his
words at <hi>Oxon.</hi> Thus then there are three Witneſſes, tho' two are enough to convict
a man, if they be poſitive to the Treaſon.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Haynes.</hi> is the 4th. Witneſs, and he is as full as any of them. I do but repeat it in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:31349:66"/>
short; you have had it ſo often canvaſſed by <hi>Colledge,</hi> that I believe you will eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
it. He did adviſe <hi>Haynes</hi> that he should not value the King at all, for the King
should be called to account for all his Actions; he ſaid he would ſeize the King and bring
him to the Block as they did his Father, with an undecent expreſſion of that bleſſed
King not fit to be repeated. And he ſaid, they did intend when they had cut off him,
never any more of his Race should raign; this it was <hi>Haynes</hi> ſays, tho' there are other
matters. I would take notice of one thing more, and I need not but mention it, you will
remember it, and that is about the Libel of <hi>Fitzharris. Haynes</hi> tells you upon diſcourſe
of that Libel, he ſaid, that every word of it was true, as ſure as God is in Heaven. Now
that was a Libel made by a Papiſt, an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſt, who hath been tryed, convicted and
executed for it, and the horrid'ſt Libel it was, that ever was Writ. And this is the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
which this Gentleman, who is ſo very converſant in Libels, and Books of that ſort,
avers to be as true as God is in Heaven. This is the ſubſtance Gentlemen of that proof
which hath been made to you; we have other circumſtances to prove, that as he came
down with that intent to ſeize the King, and as he expected what he calls ſome ſport,
ſo he did endeavour to begin the ſport, he did quarrel in the Lobby of the Houſe of
Lords with <hi>Fitzgerald,</hi> ſome blows paſſed, and Sir <hi>William Jennings</hi> telling him his
Noſe bled, he did declare, I have loſt the firſt Blood in the Cauſe, but it will not be
long before there be more loſt. Thus after he had come down, he endeavoured to
begin a commotion; for from little matters great things do ſometimes ariſe, and when
all men were poſſeſt with an expectation, ſuch as he himſelf did declare, he and others
came down with an expectation that the Parliament should be attacked; a little matter
might have begun ſuch a commotion which no man knows what end it would have
had.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, this hath been our proof. Now the Objection made to this proof by Mr.
<hi>Colledge</hi> is, That this is a Popish deſign to raiſe a new Plot; and caſt it upon the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
and that theſe Witneſſes are now to deny all the Evidence they have given of
the Popish Plot, and throw all upon the Proteſtants. This is that he would perſuade
you to believe, but which I think when you do conſider a little of it, it will be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for you in the leaſt to have ſuch a thought. For what are the Evidence that have
proved this? who are they? men of credit, that have been Evidences againſt the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Plotters, and againſt men that have ſuffered for that Plot, men that ſtill ſtand to the
Evidence they have given, and affirm it every word to be true, and one of the very men
that he brought ſays, that they ſtill ſtand to it; for <hi>Turbervile</hi> who was one of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
againſt my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> was tempted by ſome perſons to deny the Evidence he
had given againſt the Papiſts, but his anſwer was, no, I can never depart from it, I have
a Soul to ſave, that was true which I ſaid, I cannot deny it. If then the Witneſſes which
he would have you believe to be guilty of denying the Popish Plot, do confirm what
they have ſaid as to that diſcovery, that objection is taken off, and they do ſtand ſtill to
it that every part of it was true, and aver the ſame thing; and yet forſooth theſe men
are going about to ſtifle this Plot.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, theſe are the men the whole nation have given credit to, the Parliament
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:31349:66"/>
having impeached my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> upon the credit of them, (for it was upon the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of <hi>Dugdale</hi> and <hi>Turbervile</hi> that they impeached him, for there was not two witneſſes
till <hi>Turbervile</hi> came in and made a ſecond, and upon their credit) after ſo ſolemn a Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
where all the objections that could poſſibly be made, were made; the Houſe of
Lords thought fit to find my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> guilty, and my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> ſuffered for it,
and died upon the credit of theſe men. Theſe are the witneſſes, Gentlemen, that this
man thinks ought to be blown off with that frivolous objection, that they are perſons
he would have you believe, who are guilty of a deſign to throw the Plot upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.
But becauſe he hath deſired to ſave himſelf in an Herd, by numbring himſelf
amongſt the Proteſtants. I muſt a little obſerve to you what a ſort of Proteſtant he is,
a man he would have you to believe, ſo popular for his Religion, that he hath obtained
the name of the Proteſtant Joyner. But when you have conſidered what his actions
are, I believe you will a little ſuſpect his Religion. If the Proteſtant Religion allow any
man to vilifie the King, to arraign the Government, and to throw off all manner of
allegiance, then this man is a Proteſtant: but if this be to act the part of a Papiſt, and
if the Papiſts could wish that ſuch an infamy might be put upon the Proteſtant Religion,
that it should juſtifie ſuch a Rebellion as the late horrid one was, and own ſuch a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
that it is lawful for any Subject to aſperſe and vilifie the King, as this man by thoſe
many and ſcurrilous Libels ſeem to do it; if they could wish this Nation overturned,
and the Government in confuſion, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> deſtroyed, the beſt Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark
now in the world againſt Propery, and the beſt or only refuge at this day left for the
poor afflicted Proteſtants abroad. Then whilſt Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> does thus act the part of
a Papiſt, he does very ill to call himſelf a Proteſtant. Gentlemen, I cannot but obſerve
one thing to you, and it was the Evidence of Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> when he did firſt diſcover the
Plot, and without his Evidence you would eaſily believe the thing. He told you there
were two ways they had to accomplish their deſign, by direct murdering of the King,
or if that failed, by putting all things into confuſion here, and raiſing Rebellion and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance
amongſt us, and the way to effect that Rebellion, it was by having Emiſſaries
ſent among us, to work us into a diſlike of the Church, and by that means into a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
againſt the State. That ſome men were ſent abroad for that purpoſe to preach at
Conventicles, ſome whereof were catched, and ſome did ſuffer. Now without this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
it would not be hard to believe that ſuch there are, and have been; for all that
know the Hiſtory of our Reformation, do know that it was an early practice among
them, to raiſe Sects amongſt us, to bring confuſion firſt into the Church, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in
the State. And we have already found the ſad effects of it.</p>
               <p>Now Gentlemen, if <hi>Colledge</hi> have all this while under the name of a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> acted
the part of a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> though I cannot ſay he is a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> nor that he is one of thoſe Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
yet I may ſay he is not that good <hi>Proteſtant</hi> he pretends to be. Gentlemen, I muſt
now, to do him right, come to repeat the Evidence that he hath given againſt our wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes;
for Mr. <hi>Haynes</hi> he hath produced ſeveral witneſſes, one is <hi>Mr. Hickman,</hi> who ſays
he overheard <hi>Haynes</hi> ſay to one that was his Tenant, that it was his Trade to ſwear,
and he muſt get money by it. This <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e overheard him, ſtanding and liſtning at a door.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:31349:67"/>
You have another man <hi>Lun,</hi> that is the next Witneſs, and he ſays that at the <hi>Fleet-ditch,</hi>
where he ſaw him, there he declared the ſame thing to him, that he would ſwear any
thing for mony, and dam his ſoul rather than the Catholick Cauſe should ſink; and
now He comes to prove a Plot upon him that is a Proteſtant, and in his perſon upon
all the Proteſtants of <hi>England,</hi> and this man would fain throw off the credit of the
Popish Plot, and turn it upon the Proteſtants. But Gentlemen it is ſtrange, that
Mr. <hi>Haynes</hi> should have this diſcourſe with <hi>Lun,</hi> the firſt time that ever he ſaw him;
for I am ſure his own Witneſs <hi>Lun</hi> ſays it was the firſt time, and that he should imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
talk to him at this rate is ſomewhat ſtrange: But for an Anſwer to it, this
<hi>Lun</hi> we have confronted with the Evidence of <hi>White</hi> the Meſſenger, who ſwears,
that afterwards meeting him at <hi>Uxbridge, Lun</hi> asked him what Gentleman that was,
and did not know Mr. <hi>Haynes,</hi> and yet he takes upon him to prove, that he had ſpoke
ſuch words to him before. I think there is never another material Witneſs againſt
<hi>Haynes,</hi> except <hi>Whaley,</hi> who was an under-Officer in the <hi>Kings-Bench;</hi> and he ſays,
that <hi>Haynes</hi> whilſt he was a priſoner there ran away with a ſilver Tankard, but he never
was indicted or proſecuted for it, tho' he remained afterwards in the Houſe; and this
was 5 or 6 years ago.</p>
               <p>Now Gentlemen, I think the nature of this Evidence hath not that weight, as to
take off the credit of what this man hath ſaid upon his Oath, eſpecially when this mans
Evidence is ſo backed with the Evidence of other men, that I think there is no Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
at all againſt it. For the other Witneſſes, <hi>Dugdale, Smith</hi> and <hi>Turbervile,</hi> are
men whoſe credit has not been impeached, and they have confirmed in ſubſtance what
the Evidence of <hi>Haynes</hi> is; ſo that he does not ſtand alone in what he here ſwears, but
'tis confirmed with concurrent Evidence with it.</p>
               <p>Then Gentlemen, for the Objection againſt <hi>Dugdale, Turbervile</hi> and <hi>Smith,</hi> they
produced Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> to you, and he muſt vilifie the credit of thoſe men, whoſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
as to what he gave at firſt in diſcovering the Popish Plot, received credit by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſeconded by theſe men. And I cannot but obſerve it as a ſtrange thing, that this
man comes now to vilifie the Teſtimony of thoſe, who have given Evidence and been
credited by the whole Kingdom; that he should come here upon the word of a Prieſt
to declare, that Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was a man of very lewd converſation, and was a perſon
that had a foul Diſeaſe on him, when he pretended he was poyſoned. I remember
this was an Objection that hath been made by the Papiſts to him, and I believe you
have heard it often out of their mouths; but it is the firſt time that ever I heard it from
any one that is a Witneſs of the Popish Plot, and pretends to ſtand up for the Proteſtant
Religion. Gentlemen, if any ſuch thing as this could have been made out againſt him,
it had been made out e're now, the Papiſts would have taken advantage of it; and
when the Wit of all that party was bent againſt him, he could not have eſcaped the hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it proved, if it had been true, yet Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> takes upon him now to vilifie his
credit, and takes up thoſe Arguments the Papiſts have maliciouſly ſuggeſted, but yet
were never able to make out. This looks as if the Doctor were again returning to
St. <hi>Omers,</hi> that he is thus going about to diſparage the Evidence of Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> which
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:31349:67"/>
in great meaſure verified the truth of that Diſcovery, which himſelf firſt made of the
Popish Plot.</p>
               <p>Againſt <hi>Turbervile,</hi> Gentlemen, I think, there hath been very little at all objected
that can have any weight with you. Mr. <hi>Broadgate,</hi> as I ſuppoſe you obſerve, has ſaid
enough to confirm <hi>Turberviles</hi> credit; for he hath proved to you, that when he was
tempted to renounce his Evidence againſt the Papiſts, he refuſed to do it, he had more
conſcience than to do it, he knew well enough what he ſaid was true, and as he had a
Soul to ſave, he could not go from it. This is the Evidence that he gives, and which
certainly ſerves much to confirm the truth of <hi>Turbervile,</hi> beſides the ſtrict Examination
he hath been under, and beyond any thing that Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> I think, has been able to
contradict him in.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> contradicts <hi>Smith</hi> about His coming from the <hi>Coffee-Houſe</hi> to <hi>Wilcox</hi>'s
Dinner. He ſays, he did not come along with Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> but <hi>Colledge</hi> came along
with Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and <hi>Smith</hi> followed them. But, Gentlemen, you hear what <hi>Smith</hi>
has declared upon his Oath, that they came both together out of the <hi>Coffee-Houſe;</hi>
and you hear what His Witneſs Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> the Counſellor ſays: He does not poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
remember that circumſtance, yet one would think he should; for <hi>Oates</hi> ſays,
Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> the Lawyer walked juſt before them, and <hi>Colledge</hi> followed. Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> that
is the Witneſs for the King, He ſwears he came along with <hi>Colledge,</hi> but Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> the
Lawyer being asked that Queſtion, He does not remember that. Then another thing
is, Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſays, when they were there, <hi>Colledge</hi> was ſo far from diſcourſing of any
treaſonable matters, that he was very merry in the company, and talking innocently, but
Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> ſays, He was ſo far from being merry or talking Treaſon, that he fell faſt aſleep,
and ſlept behind the Table. Gentlemen, theſe Objections you ſee what the weight of
them is, and how little the Evidence agree one with another, but there is nothing that
does contradict Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> in his main Evidence. 'Tis poſſible they may not remember
particular circumſtances, whether Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> and Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> came together, ſo they
might come together for ought they know, and they may remember any circumſtance
about their retiring, but they can't take upon them to ſwear it is not ſo, and their not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
it does not prove it was not ſo, and the circumſtance it ſelf is ſo trivial, that
there was no neceſſity they should remember it. So then no Evidence that comes from
Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> can take off that that is given by <hi>Smith,</hi> tho' if Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> were out of the
Caſe, and Mr. <hi>Haynes</hi> too, yet there is Evidence ſufficient from Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Turbervile,</hi> who are not impeached, and are both to the Fact and to the place.</p>
               <p>There are two Witneſſes more that I muſt mention, and they are <hi>Bolron</hi> and <hi>Mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray;</hi>
They ſwear that <hi>Smith</hi> travelling upon the Road with them, would have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned
them to ſwear againſt <hi>John Brooks,</hi> about a Diſcourſe at ſome place; but it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
Gentlemen, they differ in point of time in their Teſtimony, the one ſaid it
was the <hi>25th.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> the other was poſitive it was the <hi>3d.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> But I think I
need ſay no more of theſe men, but only to deſire you to weigh their credit. <hi>Bolron</hi>
and <hi>Mowbray</hi> I confeſs have been Evidence againſt ſeveral men that have been accuſed
of the Popish Plot, but they have been ſo unfortunte, as never to gain credit with any
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:31349:68"/>
Jury. Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> hath been believed by the whole Court of Parliament; but if there
were no more in the caſe, theſe are two men that never were yet believed, men that
have been ſworn in their own Country, where they are well known, and been Evidence
upon Tryals, but the Jury have rejected their Teſtimony: But beſides that, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Teſtimonies, and the difference that was between them, is a ſufficient Evidence
to confront all that they have ſaid.</p>
               <p>I think, Gentlemen, this is the ſubſtance of what has been offered by his Witneſſes
againſt the Witneſſes produced for the King, except that of Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> who ſays
ſomething againſt <hi>Haynes,</hi> that <hi>Haynes</hi> should ſay he ſwore for Self-preſervation; and
againſt <hi>Smith</hi> he ſays, that he heard him ſay, he did not know of any <hi>Presbyterian Plot.</hi>
I believe that may be true, and yet it does not contradict <hi>Smiths</hi> Evidence againſt <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;</hi>
for Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> does not tell you, that he is privy to any ſuch Deſign of the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,</hi>
that he knows of any Conſultations that they held, or the ways and means
by which they would arive at the Treaſon charged upon the Priſoner at the Bar, but his
Evidence is, that this man declared there was ſuch a Deſign, that there was a party
would do it, and that he would be ſure to be one, and armed himſelf for that purpoſe;
but his not being privy to any Plot, or knowing the particulars, is no contradiction to
what he ſaid.</p>
               <p>This is that he has produced for his Defence, and by theſe things he has endeavoured
to take off the credit of our Witneſſes, and he would have you believe that he is a very
good Proteſtant though he does that which no Proteſtant would do, and which is the
Papiſts work; he has produced you Witneſſes that he has gone to Church, but I do
not ſee he has produced any Witneſſes at all that are now converſant with him, his own
Parishioners in <hi>London;</hi> but if he had brought never ſo many Witneſſes of his going
to Church, and of his conformableneſs to the Church, yet if he were guilty of theſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
he muſt give me leave to ſuſpect the Truth of his Profeſſion; and I think it a
great piece of arrogance for him to take upon him the Title of a Proteſtant, when he
has abuſed that Title by ſuch unſuitable practices: And, Gentlemen, if ſuch practices
as theſe are, which we have fully proved, are ſuch as all good men muſt abhor, I cannot
but reflect upon the condition of this man, whoſe only Hopes is, that you should now
forget your ſelves &amp; become as ill as he is. But as that cannot be preſumed, ſo I shall not
need to ſay any more to you; you are men of that conſideration that can judge between
things, and the appearances of them, and know very well how to give the due weight
to the Evidence we have given to you, as well as the Objections made by the Priſoner;
and ſo Gentlemen I shall leave it to you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Ser. jeff.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury; It has
been a long time that has been ſpent in the courſe of this Evidence; whether there has
been Art or Deſign in protracting the time, on purpoſe to obtrude upon the patience of
the Court, or that you Gentlemen should forget the force of the Evidence that has been
given againſt the Priſoner at the Bar, when there has been ſo much time taken up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily,
when there was no occaſion, as I muſt needs ſay, there was not for ſuch a
tedious Defence, I leave it to you to determine: But that which was truly intimated by
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:31349:68"/>
the Court at the beginning of the Tryal, muſt at the end of this Cauſe be repeated, and
indeed go through it all, that we of the Kings Counſel, and what the Priſoner has af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
that has not been given in proof, ſignifying nothing, and is not to be any guide
at all to you. You are upon your Oaths, and by the Oath you have taken you are bound
in conſcience to give a Verdict according to the Evidence that has been given to you,
and that is your guide; ſo that what we opened and have not proved, is no more to be
believed than what the Priſoner has ſaid for himſelf in his own Defence; and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he ſays, if he make not god proof of it, is no more to be regarded, than what we
who are for the King have alledged, and not made out.</p>
               <p>So then this being in the firſt place premiſed, I shall take care as near as I can to ſave
time of the Court, and not to treſpaſs on your patience Gentlemen unneceſſarily, in a
Caſe whereupon as great a concern does depend, as perhaps ever came to Tryal at any
Bar: For I ſay 'tis a Caſe wherein the Life and the Liberty of the King is concerned,
and that is the great concern of the Nation; the Religion of the Nation is concerned;
I would be underſtood aright, I mean the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion eſtablished by Law; for
I know no other Religion men ought to ſacrifice their Lives and Fortunes for, but the
<hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion eſtablished by Law; and when theſe things are concerned, 'tis a
Caſe of great conſequence: God forbid any perſon, <hi>Proteſtant</hi> or other, should attempt
the Life of the King, and the Subverſion of our Religion, and by ſtiling themſelves by
the Name of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> should excuſe themſelves from any ſuch crimes.</p>
               <p>For the Evidence that has been given, I shall not enumerate the particulars againſt
the Priſoner at the Bar, other than ſuch as have been omitted, (if I miſtake not) by Mr.
Sollicitor.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place are the things that hapned at <hi>Oxon.</hi> for you have had it already ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
told you by my Lords the Judges who are upon the Bench, and who (under Mr.
<hi>Colledges</hi> favour) are the Priſoners Judges in point of Law, as you are in point of Fact.
They have (I ſay) already told you what the Law is in relation to Treaſons; that in caſe
the Treaſon be in two Counties, if the Witneſſes ſpeak to the ſelf ſame Treaſon, tho' to
different Facts, that will be two Witneſſes to prove High-Treaſon; and that there has
been ſuch a Caſe, the Priſoner at the Bar, who he ſays is a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> (for his own Souls
ſake I wish he were a good one) muſt take notice, that <hi>Gavan</hi> the great Prieſt who was
tryed at <hi>Newgate,</hi> and convicted, by what Evidence? by one of them that is a Witneſs
now againſt the Priſoner at the Bar, that is <hi>Dugdale,</hi> his Treaſon was committed part in
<hi>London,</hi> part in the Country, of which part <hi>Dugdale</hi> gave Evidence; but being both to
the ſelf ſame purpoſe, by the greater part of the Judges, who were in the Commiſſion,
and preſent at the Tryal, they were reckoned a ſufficient-Teſtimony to prove him guilty
of High Treaſon: And I hope we do not live to that age, that any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> whatſoever
should come to trip up the heels of the Popish Plot, by ſaying that any of them who
ſuffered for it, did dye contrary to Law, or without ſufficient proof: for if Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi>
was not a perſon fit to be believed, or if the reſt of the Judges who tryed <hi>Gavan</hi>
were out in the Law, then that man died wrongfully; for he had as much right to have
been tryed according to the Law, as any other perſon whatſoever. Therefore, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:31349:69"/>
as to that matter, we muſt ſubmit it to my Lords the Judges, who are to give
you an account what the Law is in all its particulars before you; but as to the Fact
whereof you are Judges, that is the great matter we shall apply our ſelves to, and for
that it ſtands thus.</p>
               <p>Here is <hi>Dugdale</hi> that does give you an account what his deſign was in coming to <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;</hi>
how he came to be armed as an <hi>Index</hi> (Gentleman) of his mind. And pray give
me leave to put you in mind of one thing. You have firſt a Libel produced, and read
to you; a pretended Letter, wherein there are Queries that have been taken notice
of, and which ſeem to back the Evidence given by Mr. <hi>Maſters;</hi> for there is a vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in thoſe Queries of the proceedings of that Parliament of 41. which he has confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
enough now at the Bar to juſtifie too. But Gentlemen, you were told by the
Court, and you know it, that that Parliament was guilty of High Rebellion: And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in thoſe Queries he aſperſes not only the Government, but every man that has any
concern in it; for it takes notice not only of the King, but of all his Council: never
a Judge nor an Officer in the Nation but is traduced by it; and which is moſt material,
it was the foundation of that Libel which has been mentioned to you, and which <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>
was ſo juſtly condemned and executed for, that moſt traiterous and infamous
Libel in part of it has theſe Queries, and a great Paragraph of this Libel makes up part
of that Libel of <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> which our witneſſes ſay Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> was pleaſed to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
was as true as God is in Heaven. Another thing is this; this Gentleman, whoſe
proper buſineſs it had been no manage his employment at <hi>London</hi> for a Joyner, is beſt
ſeen in his proper place, uſing the proper Tools of his Trade. I think it had been
much more proper for him, and I believe you will think ſo too, than to come with Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols
and all thoſe Accoutrements about him, to be regulating of the Government:
what have ſuch people to do to interfere with the buſineſs of the Government? God
be thanked, we have a wiſe Prince, and God be thanked he hath wiſe Counſellors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, and He and they know well enough how to do their own buſineſs, and not
to need the advice of a Joyner, though he calls himſelf the Proteſtant Joyner. What
had he to do to engage himſelf before his advice was required? How comes he to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
himſelf ſo much, that after he had writ this Libel, wherein he is pleaſed to take
notice of Tyrants, afterwards should go to make a Print, I mean the <hi>Raree-Shew;</hi> and
when <hi>Dugdale</hi> comes to enquire of him, what do you mean by ſuch a thing, <hi>the Tyrant
ſhall go down?</hi> Says he, I mean by that the King. And what do you mean by having
them go to <hi>Breda?</hi> Why there he explains it, that he puts all the Government, the
Lords and the Bishops upon the Kings back; and being asked what he meant to have
done with them? Why the Bishops and the King, and all were to go to <hi>Breda.</hi> Theſe
are the things that himſelf did acknowledge he was the Author of, and theſe Prints he
did cauſe to be made, and he is the perſon that gives you an account, that it was but the
conception and imagination of <hi>Dugdale,</hi> that <hi>Rowley</hi> meant the King; but <hi>Dugdale</hi>
being called again, He tells you after ſome time, that he was under ſome difficulty to
know the meaning of it; and then <hi>Colledge</hi> tells him it was meant the King, and ſo he
expounded it to him. And ſo <hi>Smith</hi> tells you of that ſame name of <hi>Old Rowley</hi> again.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:31349:69"/>
Gentlemen, thus I tell you what hath been omitted. The Evidence hath been long,
and therefore we muſt be pardoned if we can't exactly repeat it. This is the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that was done at <hi>Oxon.</hi> the next is Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> who ſpeaks of what was done in
<hi>London,</hi> and he is an Evidence both as to the word <hi>Rowley,</hi> as to the coming with Arms,
and as to the declaring to what end he came, and what he had done: Mr. <hi>Haynes</hi> he
tells you both before and after the ſame, and that I muſt take notice of to you, Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>
does particularly ſay he uſed thoſe words, which I hope every Honeſt man, and every
good man, that deſires to preſerve the Government according to Law, will hear with
the greateſt deteſtation and abhorrence: He talked of the taking away the life of the
late King of bleſſed memory at ſuch an impudent rate, that every true <hi>Proteſtants</hi> blood
would curdle at the hearing of it. And this he ſaid not only to Mr. <hi>Maſters,</hi> but he
juſtified it to Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> too.</p>
               <p>In the next place you have <hi>Turbervile,</hi> who gives you all the reaſons, how he did
not only tell of theſe things Himſelf, but encouraged Him to prepare Himſelf accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
and he gave Him a mark, a Ribbon, with <hi>No Popery, no Slavery.</hi> Theſe were
marks whereby they were to be known, and they were to be one and all, as they call it,
that when ſuch a blow was ſtruck, they should be ready to fall in. There is one thing
more that I take notice of, that is, what was ſaid by a Gentleman, Sir <hi>William Jennings,</hi>
which is a confirmation of all the other Evidence; that Gentleman who hath appeared
to you to be a man of Honour even by the confeſſion of Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> Himſelf, and by
his own words; for he ſaid like an Honeſt man, and like a Loyal man too, that He
would rather engage Himſelf in three dangers for the Service of the King at Sea, than
come in cold blood to give Evidence againſt a man for his life at the Bar. And yet this
man who tells you this of Himſelf, and that very perſon whom <hi>Colledge</hi> Himſelf calls
a worthy perſon, hath given you this account, that when he told him his noſe bled, He
anſwered him, <hi>It was the firſt blood loſt in the Cauſe, but it would not be long e're there
was more loſt;</hi> an excellent cauſe for a man to venture his blood in. When he was told
of this, he began to put it off, and to uſe his own words, had a great mind to sham off
the buſineſs, but in truth there was no anſwer given to it. Gentlemen, the objections
that have been made againſt the Evidence that have not been taken notice of, I deſire to
take notice of: I think againſt three of them there has been only Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and <hi>Mr.
Oates</hi> I confeſs has ſaid <hi>in verbo Sacerdotis</hi> ſtrange things againſt <hi>Dugdale, Smith,</hi> and
<hi>Turbervile.</hi> I have only the affirmation of Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and as ill men may become good
men, ſo may good men become ill men; or otherwiſe I know not what would become
of ſome part of Mr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s teſtimony. And in the next place, if theſe men have not
ſworn true, I am ſure Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> muſt ſtand alone in the greateſt point, in which all the
Evidence agree, that is the <hi>Popish Plot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Gentlemen, I muſt take notice to you, that it is ſtrange to me, that ever you up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your conſciences should perjure three men, who poſitively upon their Oaths deny
any ſuch diſcourſes as Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſpeaks of againſt them: I do put that upon your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
whether you upon the bare affirmation of Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> in this place, will convict
three men, upon whoſe teſtimony the lives of ſo many as have ſuffered, have been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:31349:70"/>
away, and as we <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do believe juſtly. I ſay, whether you will do it upon
the bare affirmation of Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> againſt their Oaths.</p>
               <p>In the next place, Gentlemen, I muſt tell you, beſides the poſitive Evidence of theſe
Gentlemen, there is a circumſtance of improbability in the very words which he ſpeaks
of: Will any man tell me, that after ſuch time as men have given their Oaths, as <hi>Smith</hi>
had given his that he was concerned, and ſo had <hi>Dugdale</hi> and <hi>Turbervile</hi> too, that theſe
men should come and voluntarily tell Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> they were all forſworn; are theſe
men ſuch great <hi>Coxcombs</hi> as he would have us; to believe? Is it ſo probable a thing,
that any men of common knowledge would do it? Do you think a man of that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and conſideration, as <hi>Smith</hi> is an allowed Scholar, and a man of known Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> who has been reckoned by all men to be a good Evidence; do
you take theſe men to be ſuch abſolute Novices, that they muſt ſeek an occaſion to
tell him they were bribed off, and were forſworn? If you can think this, and if a bare
affirmation againſt theſe poſitive Oaths can prevail; Gentlemen, upon your conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
be it.</p>
               <p>In the next place, 'tis a ſtrange ſort of thing to believe that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> should come
out of a <hi>Coffee-Houſe,</hi> where a quarrel is pretended to have been between him and
<hi>Colledge,</hi> but Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> does upon his Oath ſay he never had any ſuch quarrel with
him, and that he should fall a <hi>damning</hi> and <hi>ſinking</hi> againſt <hi>Colledge,</hi> and againſt the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;</hi>
that there should be ſuch impudence in the world in any man as to deſire or wish
ſuch a thing! Gentlemen, theſe are ſtrange ſorts of apprehenſions, and men muſt
have very ſtrange thoughts, that can ſtrain themſelves up to the belief of them.</p>
               <p>In the next place here it is ſaid by the Priſoner, Good Lord! what a condition we
shall be in! Here is a Plot put upon the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> I hope in God there is no <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Plot,</hi> but I alſo hope the whole intereſt of the Proteſtant Religion is not involved
in the Priſoner at the Bar, and all will be deſtroyed, if Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> dies for his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
Gentlemen, the queſtion is not whether there be a Presbyterian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Proteſtant
Plot, we declare we know of none, but whether the Priſoner at the Bar have ſpoken
ſuch words, and done ſuch things as are ſworn againſt him. And I would fain know
what all the diſcourſes we have had about <hi>Iriſh</hi> witneſſes and <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſignifie, when in
all the courſe of our Evidence, there has been but one <hi>Irish,</hi> and never a <hi>Papiſt.</hi> But
here have been great diſcourſes about <hi>Macnamarra</hi> and <hi>Dennis,</hi> and what it hath been
for, but to make a noiſe, and raiſe a duſt, I can't tell; for in this cauſe there has not
been one <hi>Irish-man</hi> beſides <hi>Haynes,</hi> and never a <hi>Papiſt</hi> throughout the whole E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence:
So that it is eaſie, if men think it will take with the Auditory, for
a perſon to cry out, <hi>Oh Lord! we are all like to be undone, here are</hi> Irish <hi>Witneſſes
brought againſt us;</hi> and after all this ſtir, there is but one <hi>Iriſh</hi> Witneſs, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a <hi>Papiſt.</hi> And as for him, truly Gentlemen I muſt take notice, that even <hi>Colledge</hi>
himſelf, till ſuch time as he was taken, reckoned him an Honeſt man.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>Never in my life.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Serj. <hi>Jeff.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>It was ſo ſaid. But I do ſay Gentlemen, ſuppoſe (which I do not
admit) that the <hi>Iriſhman</hi> he ſpeaks of be out of the Caſe, not that the Country is an
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:31349:70"/>
objection againſt any mans teſtimony, God forbid it should be ſo affirmed; for truth
is not confined to places, nor to perſons neither, but applyed to all honeſt men, be they
<hi>Irish-men</hi> or others: But I ſay, ſet Mr. <hi>Haynes</hi> out of the caſe, ſuppoſe there was
no ſuch man as <hi>Haynes</hi> in this caſe, yet I muſt tell you, Gentlemen, you have as great a
proof as poſſibly can be.</p>
               <p>In the next place, I muſt take notice to you of ſome account that hath been given
of him by himſelf: It is wonderful ſtrange, when there was that kindneſs of intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
given by the Court, that he should do well to prove his Loyalty, as well as his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that he did not produce ſome of his later acquaintance. If this man that makes
himſelf a Proteſtant, would have it believed he is ſuch, I wish he would have brought
ſome of thoſe men that knew him at <hi>London</hi> to give you ſome account of him,
and not to ſtretch backward ſixteen years to prove his Birth and Education; that
is not the beſt account ſure a man can give of himſelf, to ſay after he hath been
talking at this diſloyal rate, that he is a good Proteſtant, becauſe he was thought ſo 18
years ago.</p>
               <p>Again in the next place, here is an account of the Libels given by the old woman
that is his Siſter: Truly she would have it, and that is another Libel at the Bar, as
though the man in the Red Coat, with <hi>R. C.</hi> upon it, had dropped this kind of Libel
in his Houſe, and ſo he or ſomebody elſe put a trick upon him; and becauſe she would
inveigle you to ſuch an interpretation, she ſays that they ſtaid behind till the man in the
Red Coat had fetched away the shavings, and ſo here is a new Sham Plot to be put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Priſoner, by dropping papers in his Houſe; a pretty kind of inſinuation. But
Gentlemen, againſt the Evidence of this Woman, you have the very perſon that was
there, the Officer, who ſwears that he and his Fellows came before the Waterman in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Houſe: But I ſuppoſe you obſerve how that notable talking maid and she does
agree; for the maid tells you there came a ſtrange Fellow ſeven weeks before, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
theſe things into her hands, her Maſter was abroad, and she was not to enquire
whence they came, or what they were, but paid him ſix pence for bringing
thoſe things. Now 'tis very ſtrange that the Maid should pay for the bringing
of thoſe things, and yet after that should imagine that ſomebody elſe should put
them there.</p>
               <p>But now Gentlemen, in the next place, I muſt tell you another thing, which I
would beg you to take notice of: Here are two Gentlemen, Mr. <hi>Bolron</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Mowbray,</hi> and they have given you an account that they have been Evidence againſt
the Papiſts, they did well in it; but it hath been their misfortune hitherto they have
not been believed; but whether they have been believed or not before, is no gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
to you at this time; but that which is to guide you is, whether or not
they have given you now a teſtimony that you in your own Conſciences can
believe. Now can you believe what they have ſaid, nay can you probably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it without any circumſtance to confirm it, againſt thoſe expreſs objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that ariſe from themſelves, and againſt the Oath of the perſon, when the one tells
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:31349:71"/>
you ſo exactly of the twenty fifth, twenty ſixth, twenty ſeventh, and twenty eighth
of <hi>July,</hi> and the other tells you that <hi>Smith</hi> took Poſt, and
yet overtook them not
till the Sunday after, which was the third of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> and when the Almanack is
produced, it was ſo far from making out what they ſpake of to be the ſame time, that
whereas one ſaid he came to <hi>London</hi> the twenty eighth, the others Almanack ſays it
was the <hi>27th.</hi> then pray how do theſe perſons agree, when the one ſays that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>
talked with him upon the road the <hi>28th.</hi> and the other ſays that they came to <hi>London</hi>
the <hi>27th.</hi> Theſe are circumſtances, Gentlemen, that you muſt weigh, and you may
bring the <hi>North</hi> and the <hi>South</hi> together as ſoon as their two teſtimonies, they are ſo far
aſunder. Beſides, Gentlemen, I hope you take notice of a perſon that was ſworn, a
perſon of ſome quality, a Scholar in the Univerſity here, that ſays <hi>Balron</hi> (though he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
it) did shew one of theſe Pictures, and did diſcover they were Mr. <hi>Colledges;</hi> and
<hi>Balron</hi> himſelf, his own witneſs, tells you that he did acknowledge one of thoſe Pictures
was his. It appears then how buſie he was, and concerned himſelf in what belonged
not to his Profeſſion.</p>
               <p>So that upon the whole matter, after this long Evidence that hath been given, I muſt
wholly appeal to your Lordship and the Jury; as to the Law, to your Lordship and
the Court; and as to the Fact, to the Jury: for I do not deſire any ſort of Evidence
should be ſtrained againſt a Priſoner at the Bar, who is there to be tried for his life. God
forbid if he be innocent, but he should be acquitted; but on the other ſide, conſider the
murder of that great King of ever bleſſed memory is before you, and remember that
baſe reflection which the witneſſes tell you of upon that horrid action; and as a great
Evidence, remember that ſeeming vindication of it at the Bar, which certainly no <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh-man,</hi>
no Proteſtant according to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> can hear without having
his blood ſtirred in him. And theſe things are not only teſtified by <hi>Dugdale</hi> and <hi>Smith,</hi>
but by Gentlemen of known reputation and quality; and he hath a little diſcover'd
himſelf by that defence he hath made againſt their teſtimony. But know, Gentlemen,
that the King is concerned, your Religion is concerned, that Plot that is ſo much agreed
to by all Proteſtants is concerned; for if <hi>Dugdale, Smith</hi> and <hi>Turbervile</hi> be not to be
believed, you trip up the heels of all the Evidence and diſcovery of that Plot. Then I
will conclude to you, Gentlemen, and appeal to your conſciences, for according to the
Oath that has been given to you, you are bound in your conſciences to go according to
your Evidence, and are neither to be inveigled by us beyond our proof, nor to be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by your commiſeration to the Priſoner at the Bar againſt the proof; for as God
will call you to an account if you do an injury to him, ſo will the ſame God call you to
account if you do it to your King, to your Religion, and to your own Souls.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lo. ch. juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Gentlemen, I ſhall detain you but a little, and ſhall be as short as I
can, for your patience has been much exerciſed already: It is a burden, and a neceſſary
one that lies upon us all, for there is nothing more neceſſary than that ſuch Tryals as
theſe should be intire and publick, intire for the diſpatch of them, and publick for the
ſatiſfaction of the world, that it may appear no man receives his Condemnation without
Evidence, and that no man is acquitted againſt Evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:31349:71"/>
Gentlemen, there are theſe two conſiderations in all Caſes of this nature; the one
is, the Force of the Evidence; the other is, the Truth of the Evidence. As to the
Force of the Evidence, that is a point in Law that belongs to the Court, and wherein
the Court is to direct you; as to the Truth of the Evidence, that is a queſtion in Fact a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing
from the Witneſſes, &amp; muſt be left upon them, whereof you are the proper Judges.</p>
               <p>As to the Force of the Evidence in this caſe, it muſt be conſider'd what the Charge
is; it is the compaſſing the Death of the King, and conſpiring to ſeize the Perſon of the
King, which is the ſame thing in effect; for even by the Common Law, or upon the
interpretation of the Statute of the 25. of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. that mentions compaſſing the Death
of the King to be Treaſon, it has always been reſolved, that whoſoever ſhall imagine
to depoſe the King, or impriſon the King, are guilty of imagining the Death of the
King; for they are things that depend one upon another: and never was any King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
or impriſoned, but with an intention to be put to death, they are in conſequences
the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>Now Gentlemen, in caſes of Treaſon the Law is ſo tender of the Life of the King,
that the very imagination of the Heart is Treaſon, if there be any thought concerning
any ſuch thing; but then it muſt be manifeſted by ſome Overt-act, upon the Statute
of the 25. of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. but upon the Statute of the 13. of this King, made for the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Kings Perſon, if it be manifeſted by malicious and adviſed ſpeaking, 'tis ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.
This is as to the Charge, and as to the Law concerning that Charge, I muſt
tell you there muſt be two Witneſſes in the caſe.</p>
               <p>Now then for the Force of the Evidence, the queſtion will ariſe there, whether this
Evidence, admitting it to be true, is ſufficient to maintain the Indictment; ſo that if there
be two Witneſſes, you muſt find him Guilty. Now as to this, Gentlemen, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
has before-hand called upon the Court, and had their reſolution; and I hope
you will remember what hath been ſaid, and I ſhall have occaſion to trouble you the
leſs. There have been ſix Witneſſes produced for the King; there are two of them,
Sir <hi>William Jennings</hi> and Mr. <hi>Maſters,</hi> that are ſome way applicable to the Caſe, though
they do not go to the Treaſon, they are only to infer the probability of the Treaſon.
This of Sir <hi>William Jennings</hi> was upon the occaſion of the bleeding of the Priſoners
Noſe, after his quarrel with <hi>Fitz-Gerald,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>He had loſt the firſt bloud, and it
would not be long e're there would be more loſt;</hi> which ſhews there were ſome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
thoughts in his Heart concerning ſome diviſions, quarrels, and fighting that he
expected ſhould be. That which Mr. <hi>Maſters</hi> has ſaid, (beſides what he offered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his Principles in juſtifying the Long Parliament) was this, that when he called
him Colonel, <hi>Marry mock not,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I may be a Colonel in time;</hi> that shews ſome
extraordinary thoughts were in his Heart.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>Will not that bear a more favourable interpretation, my Lord? Muſt that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
follow upon my ſaying, <hi>I might be a Colonel in time,</hi> and <hi>that more bloud would
be loſt?</hi> if I had expreſſed it ſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. c. j.</speaker>
               <p>I ſay you had ſome extraordinary thoughts in your Heart.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>I am, ſure, the fitteſt to explain my own thoughts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <speaker>L. c. j.</speaker>
               <p>You would have done well to have explained it which way you expected to
be a Colonel.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>It was not an expectation, for a may be, may not be; my word was, <hi>mocking

               <p>Well Gentlemen, theſe are Witneſſes I ſay that go not to the Treaſon, but
only relate and reflect ſomewhat to shew there were thoughts in his Heart, but no body
could tell what they were, or know what he meant by them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>Then always they are to be taken in the beſt ſence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. c. j.</speaker>
               <p>For the other Witneſſes, <hi>Stephen Dugdale, John Smith, Bryan Haynes,</hi>
and <hi>Edward Turbervile,</hi> they are all of them, taking what they ſay to be true, very full
Witneſſes. The Priſoner hath objected as to two of them, becauſe they ſpeak to
nothing that was done in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> but <hi>Turbervile</hi> and <hi>Dugdale</hi> they ſpeak to what
was ſaid in <hi>Oxfordſhire.</hi> Now for that I muſt tell you, If you believe any one of
theſe Witneſſes, as to what was ſaid in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and any of them as to what was ſaid
in <hi>London,</hi> relating to the ſame Fact of Treaſon, they will be two good Witneſſes to
maintain the Indictment, tho' the one is in the one County, and the other in another;
for if a Treaſon be committed in two Counties, it is in the Kings Election where
he will exhibit the Indictment, and the Evidence from both Counties is good
Evidence; that I take for Law, and theſe four Witneſſes, with that conſideration
that they are true, as I think are full Witneſſes to maintain this Indictment.</p>
               <p>Why then the next Head is concerning the Truth of this Evidence, of which you are
to be Judges, and you are the proper Judges whether the Witneſſes ſpeak true or no;
therefore you muſt have your own Conſciences to direct you in that caſe, and what
I shall ſay about them, shall be only for your Aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I shall not take upon me to repeat the Evidence to you, it has been
long; and for me to ſpeak out of memory, I had rather you should recur to your own
Memories, and your own Notes: only I shall ſay ſomething in general to contract
your conſideration of it.</p>
               <p>And as I told you at firſt, you muſt mind nothing of what the Kings Counſel ſaid,
for nothing muſt have impreſſion upon you, but what they proved; So you are not
to conſider any thing of the Facts the Priſoner ſpake of, that are not proved neither;
For common Juſtice is concerned in it, and no Juſtice can be done at that rate, if the
Priſoners own Affirmations or Purgation should be taken. No man ever can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
but he will be ready to ſay he is innocent, and ſay as flourishing and popular
things as ever he can for himſelf. And therefore theſe things muſt not weigh with you
further, than as what is ſaid, argues upon the Proofs you have had. And you are
to conſider upon the Proofs what the Priſoner has produced, not what he ſays on the
other ſide, for the Proofs you have heard a great many Witneſſes in general produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by him, that ſay he was bred a Proteſtant, and has been an honeſt man, that they
knew no ill by him, that will be of little weight in a caſe of this conſideration; for
unleſs he were a man that had committed Treaſon to the knowledge of all the world,
there is no man but can produce Witneſſes that know no ill of him, nor any Treaſon,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:31349:72"/>
nor Harm in him, therefore the Queſtion wiill lye upon the credit of the Witneſſes
produced for the King barely, and that will be the conſideration you are only to
have, and you are to weigh them in the Ballance againſt the Witneſſes produced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them.</p>
               <p>Now Gentlemen, for theſe Witneſſes I shall not repeat them to you, but only
this I shall obſerve in general, that <hi>Dugdale</hi> and <hi>Turbervile</hi> that are the two moſt mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Witneſſes relating to what was ſpoke in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> have the leaſt ſaid againſt
them. I do not remember, I profeſs to you I do not (but your own Notes muſt
guide you) that there was any very material thing ſaid againſt them except what
is ſaid againſt them by Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> does ſay againſt <hi>Smith,</hi> that he
came out of the Coffee-Houſe, and ſwore Dam him he would have <hi>Colledges</hi> Bloud,
and when he reproved him, and ſaid it was not fit for a Miniſter of the Goſpel to
uſe ſuch Expreſſions, he ſaid God damn the Goſpel, if that be true 'tis a great Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
upon the credit of <hi>Smith.</hi> He ſays as to <hi>Dugdale,</hi> that when he was expoſtulating
with him about his Evidence, he excuſed himſelf, that he was in want of mony, and
was preſſed to it, and being asked whether he was preſſed to ſwear againſt his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
he ſaid yes; and much of the ſame kind he ſays as to <hi>Turbervile,</hi> that he ſaid
He was diſſerted and would not ſtarve. Now all theſe three Witneſſes being called
upon their Oaths deny that which Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> teſtifies. Now if it were in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
and probable matter to have three men condemned, and ſet aſide by the
Teſtimony of one is not equal, unleſs the man were of mighty extraordinary credit,
and his Teſtimony of more than ordinary weight. But then I muſt tell you this matter
is very improbable, that after Witneſſes had ſworn a thing they should voluntarily
acknowledge themſelves to be forſworn, and that without any Provocation, they should
at ſeveral times come to this one man and declare themſelves Rogues and Villaines,
but if it were probable, here are three mens Oaths againſt one mans Affirmation, this
I ſay as to what concerns <hi>Dugdale</hi> and <hi>Turbervile,</hi> I do not ſee any thing material a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, beſides now if you believe them, they are two Witneſſes to the full mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Indictment, and two Witneſſes to what was done in <hi>Oxfordshire,</hi> and that
ſatisfies all the conſiderations of Law.</p>
               <p>As to the reſt of the Witneſſes, <hi>Bryan Haynes</hi> and <hi>John Smith,</hi> you have had many
Witneſſes produced againſt them, I shall not undertake to repeat the Evidence,
'tis your place and duty to weigh their Teſtimony, and I shall leave it to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I have nothing more to offer, but only that I am innocent of what is

<hi>London:</hi> They ſwear now, I was to ſeize the King at <hi>Oxford.</hi> In <hi>London</hi> they ſwore
I would pluck the King out of <hi>Whitehall,</hi> but 'tis altered ſince, and now 'tis to ſeize
the King at <hi>Oxford,</hi> but be it either one or t'other (for the one is as true as the other) I
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:31349:73"/>
am wholly innocent of either, I never had ſuch a thought in my life, God forgive them that
have ſworn againſt me, I have no more to ſay, my Lord.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. c. j.</speaker>
               <p>Look you, <hi>Mr. Colledge,</hi> it is too late to profeſs your innocence, you have been
tryed and found guilty; but becauſe you ſay it now, 'tis neceſſary for me to ſay ſomething
in vindication of the Verdict, which I think the Court were all very well ſatisfied with:
There were ſufficient proofs to warrant it, and the Jury did according to juſtice and right.
I thought it was a caſe, that as you made your own defence, ſmall proof would ſerve the
turn to make any one believe you guilty. For as you would defend your ſelf by pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be a Proteſtant. It is wonder, I muſt confeſs, when you called ſo many witneſſes to
your Religion and Reputation, that none of them gave an account that they ſaw you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Sacrament within theſe many years, or any of them particularly had ſeen you at
Church in many years, or what kind of Proteſtant you were. If we look to your words and
actions, it is true, they did prove this, that you were mighty violent and zealous in crying
out againſt Popery, and the Papiſts; but if we look to your actions, they ſavoured rather to
promote the Papiſts ends. For I muſt tell you, the Papiſts are beſt extirpated and ſuppreſſed
by a ſteady proſecution of the Laws againſt them, not by violent crying out, and putting the
people into fervent heats and confuſions, for that is the thing the Papiſts aim at; they have
no hopes any other way to creep into the Kingdom but by confuſion, and after the Church is
deſtroyed, that is, under God, the beſt Bulwark againſt them. But you that cryed ſo loud
againſt the Papiſts, it was proved here who you called Papiſts. You had the boldneſs to ſay
that the King was a Papiſt, the Biſhops were Papiſts, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> were Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.
If theſe be the Papiſts you cry out againſt, what a kind of Proteſtant you are, I know
not, I am ſure you can be no good one. But truly I thought you would have made better
proof of that thing, when you called ſo manny witneſſes to that purpoſe: And then if we
look to your Politicks, what opinion you had of the King, it was proved by your diſcourſe,
and by witneſſes, that you could have no exception to their teſtimony, that you did juſtify
the late horrid Rebellion, and the conſequences of that was the murder of the beſt King in
the world, that you should go to juſtifie the proceedings of that Parliament, and affirm
that they did nothing but what they had juſt cauſe to do. I ſay he that will juſtifie ſuch
a thing, if there were the ſame circumſtances, would do the ſame thing again.</p>
               <p>Then if we look upon another part of your defence, as to your Arms, it was objected you
went armed to <hi>Oxon.</hi> and that was made the Evidence of the Overt Act, when you ſaid
by words your intentions what you would do, that you would make one to ſeize the King,
that you did go armed, you did confeſs. I expected you should have ſaid, you only wore
thoſe things for your own defence upon the road, as a Gentleman travelling, or went with
your friends to accompany them out of Town, and defend them from robbery; but you ſaid
you went to guard the Parliament. I did not underſtand what you meant by it. I do not
believe the Parliament ſent for any Guard, or intended to have any Guard. I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that any of them in their hearts thought they needed a Guard; for I believe there
was not a man that had any thing that looked like that, for any thing of that nature. For
we ſaw, that when the King by the necesſity of his affairs, when the two Houſes differed
ſo much, was pleaſed to diſmiſs them; they all departed quietly, not a man was ſeen to be
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:31349:74"/>
diſturbed; there was no appearance of any ſuch thing, and how it ſhould come <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nto your
head, that were but a private man, to go to guard the Parliament, I much wonder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
all men of your condition ſhould have gone to have guarded the Parliament, what
an Aſſembly had there been? what a buſtle might they have made, and what confuſion
might there have been on a ſudden? And though you ſay you are no man of quality, nor
likely to be able to do any thing upon the Kings Guards; or the Kings perſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet if all of
your quality had gone upon the ſame deſign that you did, what ill conſequences might have
been of it? We ſee what has been done by <hi>Maſſianello</hi> a mean man in another Countrey,
what by <hi>Wat Tyler</hi> and <hi>Jack Straw</hi> in this Kingdom? I confeſs I know not what you
meant by it, but very ill things might have hapned upon it.</p>
               <p>So that theſe things when I look upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and conſider the complexion of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
it makes an eaſie proof have credit. But I think there was a full proof in your
caſe; yet I ſay, if there had been a great deal leſs proof, the Jury might with juſtice have
found you guilty. And becauſe you now declare your ſelf innocent of all you are charged
with, I think my ſelf bound to declare here in vindication of the Countrey, and in vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the juſtice of the Court, that it was a Verdict well given, and to the ſatisfaction
of the Court, and I did not find my Brothers did diſlike it. This I ſay to you out of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
that you may incline your mind to a ſubmisſion to the juſtice that has overtaken you,
and that you may enter into charity with all men, and prepare your ſelf for another life.</p>
               <p>There is nothing now remaining, but to pronounce the Sentence which the Law provides
for ſuch an Offence; which is this, and the Court does award,
<q>That you <hi>Stephen Colledge</hi> shall be carried from hence to the place from whence
you came, and from thence you shall be drawn on an Hurdle to the place of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
where you shall be hanged up by the Neck, and be cut down alive, your
Privy-members shall be cut off, and your Bowels taken out and burnt before your
face, your Head shall be cut off from your Body, your Body be divided into four
quarters, which are to be at the Kings diſpoſe, and the Lord have mercy upon your
Soul.</q>

               <p>Amen. My Lord, I would know what time your Lordship is pleaſed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
for my preparation?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lo. ch. juſt.</speaker>
               <p>That will depend upon the King's pleaſure: We do not uſe in theſe
caſes of High-Treaſon to precipitate the Execution, but we will leave ſuch order with
the Sheriff to receive the King's pleaſure, and obey it. He will not do it ſo ſudden
but that you shall have notice to prepare your ſelf; but it depends upon the King's
pleaſure; for your body is to be at his diſpoſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <stage>Then the Court adjourned.</stage>
            <p>And on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 31. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1681. being the day appointed by His Majeſty
for his Execution, He was according to Sentence, executed over againſt the Gate of
the Caſtle at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
