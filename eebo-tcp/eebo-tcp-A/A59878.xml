            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>LXXVII Psalm 10, 11, 12.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <p>And I said, This is my infirmity; but I will
remember the years of the right hand of
the most High.</p>
                  <p>I will remember the works of the Lord:
surely I will remember thy wonders of
old.</p>
                  <p>I will meditate also of all thy works, and talk
of thy doings.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Psalmist, at the penning of this
Psalm, was oppressed with very black
and desponding Thoughts: The state
of the Church seems to have been
very calamitous, they had been so long and so
grievously afflicted, that he began to question,
whether God would ever be merciful to them
again: <hi>Will the Lord cast off for ever: and will
he be favourable no more? Is his mercy clean gone
for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?
Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
shut up his tender mercies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:57454:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But in my Text he recollects himself, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
his Wickedness and Sin in giving the least
entertainment to such unworthy Thoughts of
God, as if he could forget his Promise and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
which he had made to their Fathers <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob, This is my infirmity;</hi>
want of Faith and Trust in God's Promises:
and to cure this Diffidence, to revive his dying
Hopes, and to confirm his Faith in God, he calls
to mind those glorious Deliverances which God
had wrought for his Church, and his People <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
in former Ages: <hi>I will remember the years of
the right hand of the most High;</hi> those days when
God did so visibly deliver <hi>Israel</hi> with his own right
hand; as it follows 14, 15 Verses, <hi>Thou art the
God that doest wonders; thou hast declared thy
strength among the people. Thou hast with thine
arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and
Joseph.</hi> And instances in those miraculous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances
in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the Red Sea, and the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
as a reason and foundation of a firm
Faith and Trust in God in all Ages; these are
those Works of the Lord, and Wonders of
Old, which he will remember, which he will
meditate, and talk of, with which he will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
his Spirit, whatever Dangers seem to
threaten the final Ruin and Desolation of the
<pb facs="tcp:57454:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Church; which is the Argument of the 80 <hi>Psalm
14, 15. Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts:
look down from heaven, and behold and visit this
vine, and the vineyard which thy right hand hath
planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for
thy self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That God had made a Covenant with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and chose his Seed and Posterity for his
peculiar People; that he had delivered them
out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> by a mighty hand, and an out
stretched arm; that he had given them passage
through the Red Sea, and fed them in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
forty Years; that he had fought their
Battles for them, and given them possession of
the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as he had promised to
their Fathers; that he had in all succeeding
Ages protected them by a visible Providence,
raised up Judges and Saviours to deliver them
out of the hands of their Enemies, when they
cried to him; this was a sure foundation of
their Faith and Hope, that God would not
utterly cast off his People, but though for their
sins, he might deliver them into the hands of
their Enemies, yet when they repented of their
Evil Ways, and returned unto God, God also
would return, and be merciful unto them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:57454:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And this is the wisest course we can take,
whatever Troubles we suffer, whatever we fear,
whatever our Sins have deserved, whatever our
Enemies threaten, <hi>To remember the works of the
Lord, and his wonders of old, to meditate of all
his works, and to talk of his doings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is what I at present intend, to make
such Remarks on the Providence of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, not omitting the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
the Christian Church has had of the
same kind, and watchful Providence, as may
be of present use to us, both to direct us what
we must do, and to give us a firm Hope and
Trust in God's Mercy; for God is always the
same under all the Dispensations of his Grace
and Providence; and as the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church
was a Type of the Christian, so God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
towards them, assures us, what we may
expect in like Circumstances, or else the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
of the Old Testament would be of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little use to us now, whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells
us, <hi>That these things happened to them for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samples,
and they are written for our admonition
upon whom the ends of the world are come,</hi> 1 Cor.
10, 11. But what difference there is between
their State and ours, and how far we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the Examples, I shall distinctly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb facs="tcp:57454:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
under the several Particulars, as there is
occasion for it:</p>
            <p>I. First then I observe as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>That
the gifts and calling of God are without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
11.</hi> Rom. 29. God having made a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and chosen his Seed for
his peculiar People, whatever their Provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were, he would never wholly cast them
off; he many times very severely punished them,
delivered them into the hands of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
who oppressed them, the <hi>Aramites,</hi> and
<hi>Moabites,</hi> and <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and <hi>Assyrians,</hi> and at
last into the hands of <hi>Nebucadnezar,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
their City and Temple, and carried
them captive into <hi>Babylon,</hi> where they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
seventy Years, and then they returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their own Country, and rebuilt their Temple
and City, and so continued till in punishment
of their great Sin in crucifying their <hi>Messias,</hi>
and for their obstinate Infidelity, they were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
destroyed by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and dispersed
into all Nations, and have never been a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
since; that is, till Christ came, who was
the promised Seed, in whom all the Nations of
the World are blessed, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> proves, 3
<hi>Gal. 16. To Abraham and his seed were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
<pb facs="tcp:57454:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
made:</hi> He <hi>saith not, Vnto seeds, as of many;
but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.</hi> I
say till Christ, who was the promised Seed,
and typified by <hi>Isaac,</hi> came, the carnal Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> descending from <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi>
were the Typical <hi>Israel,</hi> and God's peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
People, and visible Church on Earth, and all
this while God never wholly cast them off; but
when Christ came, then the Promise was esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
to the spiritual seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> those
who are the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> by Faith in
Christ, as the Apostle proves in the same place,
6, 7, 8, 9. and in several other places: And
this is the Answer, which the Apostle gives to
that terrible Objection against Christ's being the
<hi>Messias,</hi> and God's owning the Christian Church
for his peculiar and elect People, as formerly he
did the <hi>Jews;</hi> that then God's Promise to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
and his Seed fails: His answer is, That
the Promise to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, was meant
of Christ, and his spiritual Seed, those who are
the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> by Faith in Christ; as
he proves at large in the 9, 10, 11 Chapters to
the <hi>Romans;</hi> though he gives another answer
to this too, That though the Promises do no
longer belong to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s carnal Seed, yet
God so far remembers his Covenant with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57454:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and his carnal Seed, that he has not wholly
cast them off, but will in time engraft them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Church again by Faith in Christ: <hi>For out
of Sion shall come the deliverer, and shall turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
ungodliness from Jacob.</hi> But I cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
on this now.</p>
            <p>To apply this then to the times of the Gospel:
We certainly learn from God's Care of the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi>
Church, that God will always preserve and
protect the Christian Church, that the true Faith
of Christ, and his true and sincere Worshippers
shall never wholly fail in the World, as Christ
promises, That <hi>the gates of hell shall not prevail</hi>
against his Church: for God established an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed,
that is, with Christ, and the Christian Church,
who are the true spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> to
whom the Promises belong; and if God so pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
performed his Promise to the carnal
Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> while they were to be his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Church until Christ came, who was the
promised Seed, we learn by that Example, how
he will protect, defend, and support the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church to the end of the World; till
Christ the promised Seed return again to Judge
the World, to put an end to all Things, and
<pb facs="tcp:57454:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to receive his Church into the Kingdom of his
Father.</p>
            <p>To this we owe the Continuance and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the Christian Church to this Day,
amidst all the Dangers which have threatned its
final Ruin; when the Church is tossed on the
foaming Billows of this World, like the Ship
into which Christ and his Disciples entred: 8
<hi>Matth.</hi> 23, 24, 25. When <hi>there arose a great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered
with the waves; and Christ was asleep, and his
disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying,
Lord, save us; we perish. And he saith unto
them, Why are ye so fearful, O ye of little faith?
then he arose and rebuked the wind and the sea,
and there was a great calm.</hi> This was a Figure and
Emblem of the condition the Church is very
often in in this World: for most of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
Miracles had some spiritual significations in
them: His curing the Halt, and Blind, and
Lame, and Deaf, represented his Diviner Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in curing the Diseases and Distempers of our
Souls, in making the Blind to see, and the Deaf
to hear, and the Lame to walk; and therefore
when he cured the Man that was born blind, he
turned his Discourse to spiritual Blindness, 9
<hi>John</hi> 39, 40, 41. When he had fed that great
<pb facs="tcp:57454:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Multitude with a few loaves and small Fishes,
he discourses to them of that Bread that comes
down from Heaven, and will nourish them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Eternal Life, and which he only could give
them, 6 <hi>John,</hi> when he discoursed with <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi>
about raising her Brother <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the
Dead, he preaches to her his Divine Power to
raise dead Souls as well as dead Bodies, into
immortal Life, 11 <hi>John</hi> 25, 26. When the
Disciples at Christ's command had cast their
Net into the Sea, [after having toiled all night
and taken nothing] and encompassed a great
multitude of Fishes, he tells them the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, that he would make them Fishers of
Men. Thus here Christ's rebuking the Wind
and Sea, which were ready to swallow up the
Ship, wherein he and his Disciples were, is a
Figure of the State of the Church in this
World, and of his Readiness to Protect it:
How threatning soever the Dangers are, Christ
is in the Ship, and all the Powers of the World,
how much soever they rage and foam, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
swallow up that Ship, wherein Christ is,
unless they can swallow Him up too: and
though he may seem to be asleep, and to take
no notice of the Sufferings and Dangers of his
<pb facs="tcp:57454:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Church, yet the importunate Prayers and Cries
of his Disciples will awake him, and then he
will arise to their defence, and hush the Winds
and Seas into a Calm.</p>
            <p>This the Church had frequent experience of
under the Pagan Persecutions, which raged
with Fire and Sword, and all the witty Arts
of Cruelty; when nothing would serve but the
final Extirpation of the Name of Christians:
But how often did Christ rebuke the Wind
and Sea, and restore profound Peace and Rest
to his Chuch? What a glorious Triumph did
he give his Church over the last and most ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Efforts of the Pagan Powers, when he
raised <hi>Constantine</hi> into the Throne, and made
the Empire Christian?</p>
            <p>And this is a very comfortable Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to us at this time: The Protestant Churches
which profess the Pure and Uncorrupt Faith and
Worship of Christ, as to all the essentials of Faith
and Worship, have now for many Years groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under the Antichristian Tyranny and Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions,
and now at last, and I hope it may
be the last, as it is the most terrible Insult of the
Anti-christian Powers, a Great and Mighty
Prince bends his whole Force to root out the
Protestant Name, as well as to Usurp upon
<pb facs="tcp:57454:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Liberties of <hi>Europe:</hi> What he has done
in his own Country, and where-ever his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Influence reached, I need not tell
you: From some of his Subjects he has forced
away their Faith; others to keep their Faith
have lost their Estates, their Liberty, their
Country, their Lives.</p>
            <p>What danger we were in at Home, we all
saw and felt not long since, though some
Men would now perswade us, it was but a
Dream; but it was a very terrible Dream, if
it was one, and thanks be to God that we
are awakened out of it, and may we never
fall into such frightful Slumbers more; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
let us neither be lulled asleep, nor dream
awake, lest these frightful Dreams prove Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
at last.</p>
            <p>For should that mighty Monarch prevail,
and like an irresistible Torrent bear all
before him; as some kind Friends to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the Protestant Name
and Interest, wish and pray he may; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
not a Spirit of Prophesy, to foretel
what will become of Protestants: But our
Hope and Trust is in God, that the true
Christian Faith shall never be rooted out; and
<pb facs="tcp:57454:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I am as certainly perswaded, that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Faith and Worship, as to the Essentials
of it, and as opposed to Popery, is the true
Christian Faith and Worship, as I am of the
truth and certainty of Christianity itself: and
when I remember by what little beginnings,
and weak and contemptible means, GOD
spread the true Light of the Gospel over
great part of the <hi>European</hi> World, when it
was covered with the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Darkness, and
oppressed by the Unsupportable Tyranny of
Popery; notwithstanding all the Follies, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
and Miscarriages of Protestants, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
fear, that God will cause our Sun to set
again, and that he will finally remove his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
from us; and that gives great reason to
hope, that he will check the Pride and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
and put a stop to the Successes of a
Prince, who glories in the Extirpation of his
Protestant Subjects, and at once enslaves both
the Bodies and the Souls of Men; who chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges
as absolute a Dominion over the Faith,
as over the Estates of his Vassals, to fill his
Exchequer and Purgatory together. This I
am sure, we ought heartily to beg of God in
our most solemn Prayers and Fasts; and those
<pb facs="tcp:57454:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who scruple this, if they understand themselves,
must never say the Lord's Prayer more, wherein
our Saviour has taught us to pray, <hi>Thy Kingdom
come,</hi> which those who wish success to Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and Antichristian Powers, do not and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pray.</p>
            <p>II. I observe farther, That as God's Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Posterity, was sure
and stedfast, that no provocations could ever
tempt him utterly to destroy them, so he never
inflicted any publick Judgments and Calamities
on them, but when he was greatly provoked by
their Sins. This was God's express Covenant
with them, 26 <hi>Levit.</hi> That <hi>if they walked in his
statutes, and kept his commandments,</hi> then he
would bestow all Temporal Blessings on them,
Rain in its season, and the encrease of their
Land, in Corn, and Wine, and Oyl; Peace at
home, and Victory abroad, and his special Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
and Favour: <hi>I will set my tabernacle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
you; and my soul shall not abhor you, and
I will walk among you, and will be your God, and
you shall be my people.</hi> But if they would not
hearken unto him, and would not do all his
Commandments, then he threatens all sorts of
Evils should befal them, sickness of Body, to flie
<pb facs="tcp:57454:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
before their Enemies, the unfruitfulness and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renness
of their Land, that they shall be a prey
to wild Beasts, that the Sword shall devour
them, and they shall be enslaved to their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and buy their own Bread of them; that
they should suffer Famine to such extremity, as
to eat their owns Sons and Daughters, that he
would lay wast their Cities, and make their
Country desolate; and carry them away cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
into foreign Countries, as you may see at
large in that Chapter: This was his Covenant
with them; and this he punctually observed:
whenever they did obey him, they were a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
and prosperous People, their Enemies crouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before them, they injoyed Plenty and Peace,
enlarged their Borders, and made their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
Subjects and Tributaries to them; and
tho' God did not always punish them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their deserts, yet he never did inflict any
publick or national Judgments on them, but
when they were grown very corrupt and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their manners; as it were easie to shew
from the History of those Times and all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
Judgments God inflicted on them.</p>
            <p>Now, I must confess when we apply this to
the Christian Church, the case is very different,
for God has not so expresly covenanted with
<pb facs="tcp:57454:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Christian Church for external Peace and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
as he did with the <hi>Jews;</hi> they were the
carnal Seed and Posterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Heirs of
an earthly <hi>Canaan</hi> and external Prosperity, but
the spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> are Heirs of spiritual
and eternal Blessings, which were typified by the
carnal Promises made to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church: the
Christian Church was founded in the Sufferings
of our Lord; the Christian Faith was at first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated
by the courage, patience, and sufferings of
the Apostles, and the Primitive Martyrs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors:
The Terms our Saviour proposes to us
are, <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny
himself, and take up his cross, and follow me: He
that loveth his life, shall lose it, but he that loseth
his life for my sake shall find it:</hi> And therefore
the most sincere Believers, and most exemplary
Christians, may suffer very severely in this World,
and their support and comfort is, that they shall
be proportionably rewarded in the next: this
was the great Objection the <hi>Jews</hi> made against
Christians being the Sons and peculiar People of
God, that they were hated and persecuted for
the Faith of Christ, and God suffered them to be
so; whereas he had promised all Temporal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
to the observance of his Laws and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes;
and if believing in Christ had been the
<pb facs="tcp:57454:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Will and Commandment of God, he would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
have made good all the Promises of their
Law to the Disciples of Jesus: An Objection
which very much troubled many believing <hi>Jews</hi>
themselves, who did not thoroughly understand
the difference between the <hi>Jewish</hi> and Christian
Dispensation, between the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the
Gospel of Christ, and therefore is particularly
answered by St. <hi>Paul, 8 Rom.</hi> and in the 7 <hi>Heb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this shews, that their Faith and Worship
of Christ is not always rewarded with external
Prosperity, and we must not expect it should be,
and consequently that very severe Sufferings and
Persecutions may befal Christians, not always for
the correction and punishment of their Sins, but
for the trial of their Faith and Patience, to make
them conformed to their Suffering Head, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them for richer and brighter Crowns, to
convince and convert their Persecutors, and to
propagate the Christian Faith in the World.
Though it is observed by some of the Ancient
Fathers, and particularly by St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> That
God never sent a general Persecution upon the
Christian Church, but when their Sins, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
declension of Piety and Discipline, their
Worldly Mindedness, the formality and coldness
of their Devotions called for a Scourge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:57454:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thus it was with the Church, while it sojour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
as I may so speak, in the world, as in a
strange land, had no place of its own, no earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Power and Authority to support it, but lived
under Pagan Powers, was intermixt with them,
and oppressed by them, when they pleased; but
the case of a Christian Nation, where the Power
and Authority is Christian, seems very different,
and to come nearer the state of the <hi>Jewish</hi>
Church; for God does not use to inflict Publick
Judgments and Calamities upon Nations, but
for the Punishment of some Publick and Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Sins: And, therefore a Christian Nation, which
professes the True Faith and Worship of Christ,
preserves the Reverence of Religion, corrects
and suppresses Vice, may expect to be blessed
with all external Prosperity; <hi>for righteousness, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth
a nation;</hi> it does so in its natural tendency
and effects, and it does so by the Blessing of God;
and therefore when God brings any Publick
Judgments upon a Nation professing the true
Faith of Christ, we have reason to take notice of
God's Anger and Displeasure; to inquire what
is amiss among us; what that accursed thing is,
which hath provoked God to Jealousie, and
made him take the Rod into his hand. We have
then reason to humble our selves before God, to
deprecate his Anger and Displeasure; to turn
<pb facs="tcp:57454:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from all the evil of our ways, that he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
and be merciful to us.</p>
            <p>But there is one thing worth observing, which
may be matter of Hope and Comfort to us at this
time, That God never delivered the <hi>Jewish</hi>
Church into the hands of their Enemies to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
them, never carried them away into Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
excepting the last Destruction of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
in Punishment of their Sin in Crucifying
their Messias, but only when they were guilty of
Idolatry: A Corruption of Manners might bring
other Judgments upon them; but it was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
and I think always, for their Idolatry, that
God made their Enemies rule over them, and
carried them captive into a Strange land. This
we have a summary account of, <hi>Judges</hi> 2. how
that after the Death of <hi>Joshua</hi> and those Elders
who had seen all that God did for them, <hi>they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook
the Lord, and served Baal and Ashtaroth; and the
anger of the Lord was kindled against them, and God
deliver'd them into the hands of spoilers, who spoiled them,
v. 11, 12, &amp;c.</hi> For this Sin of Idolatry, the
Ten Tribes were carried away into a Perpetual
Captivity, and <hi>Judah</hi> carried captive to <hi>Babylon,</hi>
which they were threatned with by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
for their <hi>Whoredoms,</hi> that is, their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
2, 4, 5. chapt. of <hi>Hosea;</hi> and this is the
account the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> gives of it, <hi>like as ye
<pb facs="tcp:57454:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land,
so shall ye serve strangers in a land which is not yours,</hi>
5 Jer. 19.</p>
            <p>Now in proportion to God's dealing with the
<hi>Jewish</hi> Church, we have reason to hope, That
though a Church and Nation which professes
the true Faith and Worship of Christ, may be
severely punished for their other Sins, yet while
they preserve themselves clean from Spiritual
Fornication, from all Antichristian Idolatries,
God will not Un-Church them, nor deliver them
finally up into the Power of Idolatrous Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors:
I am sure we of this Nation, ever since
the Reformation of Religion among us, though
God has made us smart severely for our other
Sins, have yet always found a watchful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
defending us from all Attempts, though
contrived with Art and Skill, and backed with
Power, to reduce us again under the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke.
May the same Good Providence still watch over
us, and defend us, and neither suffer our Popish
Enemies to rejoice over us, nor deluded Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
to make dangerous and fatal Experiments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> When God did think fit to correct his
People, he always kept the Rod in his own hand,
and prescribed the Measures and Continuance
of their Sufferings. This is so plain, from all the
Promises and Threatnings of the Law, and from
<pb facs="tcp:57454:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Examples of God's Providence towards <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
that there is no need to multiply particular
Instances. There was no Good nor Evil befel
<hi>Israel,</hi> but by a particular Providence; God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
Judgments on them when he saw fit, and
he removed them again; He gave Commission
to Plague, and Sword, and Famine, which they
could not exceed. In the 26. <hi>Levit.</hi> we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
That God proportion'd his Judgments to
their Sins. When their Sins were grown so Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and National, as to deserve some Publick
Judgments, yet at first God threatens them with
some more light and gentle Punishments; but if
they continued incorrigible, he tells them he had
more terrible Judgments in reserve for them;
which proves, That God determines the Kinds,
Degrees, and Continuance of his Judgments.
When <hi>David</hi> for his sin in Numbring the People,
had that hard Choice given him, <hi>of seven years
famine, or to flee three months before his enemies, or
three days pestilence;</hi> he answers, <hi>Let me fall now into
the hands of the Lord, (for his mercies are great) and
let me not fall into the hand of man,</hi> 2 Sam. 24. 14.
That is, he chose Pestilence before the Sword;
for Pestilence is God's immediate hand; and tho
the Sword be God's Judgment too, yet it is put
into the hands of men, who gratifie their own
Lust and Rage, and Revenge with it. And yet, tho
<pb facs="tcp:57454:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God leaves more to man in this, than in any
other Judgments, he does not put the Sword
wholly out of his own hands, when he puts it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of men, but gives Laws to it; as
appears from the example of the King of <hi>Assyria,</hi>
whom God sent against <hi>Jerusalem, To take the
spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like
the mire in the street. Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither
doth his heart think so, but it is in his heart to destroy,
and cut off nations, not a few: Wherefore it shall come
to pass, that when the Lord hath performed his whole
work upon mount Zion,</hi> (what he himself, not
what the King of <hi>Assyria</hi> intended to do), <hi>I will
punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,
and the glory of his high looks,</hi> 10 Isa. 5, 6,
7,—12.</p>
            <p>Now God has the same tender care of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Nation, that he had of <hi>Israel;</hi> He mingles
our Cup for us, he prescribes what we shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
and how long: and he corrects as a Father,
not to destroy, but to reform; and this is a
mighty comfort, that whatever men threaten,
we are in the hands of God, who has the Winds
and Seas at his command, <hi>who giveth Salvation to
Kings, who delivereth David his Servant from the
hurtful Sword,</hi> Psal. 144. 10. The most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Oppressors are but the Rod of God's Anger;
the more fierce and savage Instruments God em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys
<pb facs="tcp:57454:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to correct us, we may conclude, the
more angry God is; but whatever the Rod is,
it is God that strikes, who knows when to strike,
and when to spare: We never have any reason
to be afraid of men, whatever their Power,
how great soever their Rage and Vengeance be;
but ought to pray to God as the Prophet does,
<hi>O Lord, correct me, but with judgment, not in thine
anger, lest thou bring me to nothing,</hi> Jer. 10. 24.
<hi>O Lord rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten
me in thy sore displeasure; have mercy upon me, O
Lord, for I am weak, O Lord heal me, for my bones
are vexed,</hi> Psal. 6. 1, 2. or as it is in <hi>Psal. 56. 1,
2, 3. Be merciful to me, O God, for man would swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
me up, he fighting daily oppresseth me; mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
would daily swallow me up, for they be many that
rise up against me, O thou most High. What time I
am afraid, I will trust in Thee; in God I will praise
his word; in God I have put my trust, I will not fear
what flesh can do unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4thly, <hi>When God does think fit to correct his
People, yet he always removes his Judgments
upon their sincere Repentance: This was God's
express Covenant with</hi> Israel, 26. Levit. 40, 41,
42. If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their Fathers, with the trespass which they tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
against me; and also that they have walked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to me, and that I also have walked contrary to
<pb facs="tcp:57454:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them, and have brought them into the Land of their
Enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled,
and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquities,
then will I remember my Covenant with <hi>Jacob,</hi> and also
my Covenant with <hi>Isaac,</hi> and also my Covenant with
<hi>Abraham</hi> will I remember, and I will remember the
land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus in the time of the Judges, when God
for their sins delivered them into the hands of
their Enemies, when they cried to God, he raised
up Saviours for them: Nay, many times, when
their repentance was not very sincere, nor last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
yet in great goodness and compassion he
spared them:</hi> When he slew them, then they sought
him, and returned, and inquired early after God; and
they remembred that God was their Rock, and the high
God their Redeemer; nevertheless they did flatter him
with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their
tongue, for their heart was not right with him, neither
were they stedfast in his Covenant; but he being full of
compassion forgave their iniquities, and destroyed them
not; yea many a time turned he his anger away, and did
not stir up all: his wrath; for he remembred that they
were but flesh, a wind that passeth away, and cometh
not again, 78 <hi>Psalm</hi> 34, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So that how angry soever God be; we have a
certain way of appeasing his anger. Nothing
but sin can provoke a merciful God, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate
<pb facs="tcp:57454:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Father to punish; He has a great
tenderness for all his Creatures; <hi>He doth not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
willingly, nor grieve the children of men;</hi> and
therefore he is more easily appeased, than he is
provoked; Judgment is his strange work, but he
delights in Acts of Mercy, and seems pleased
with an honourable occasion to shew mercy,
without exposing his Laws and Government to
contempt: And therefore Repentance and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
will always appease him; nay some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
we see, that the very shews and appearance
of a publick and solemn Repentance, though it
be not so sincere and hearty as it ought to be,
makes him stay his hand, and expect our return.
And this is a great encouragement, and a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
obligation on us to return to God when he
strikes, to humble our selves under his mighty
hand, for there is no other way to remove his
Judgments, and this will do it.</p>
            <p>It is a vain thing to trust in Armies and Navies,
in the Courage and Conduct of Princes and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
when our Sins fight against us, when God
refuses to go forth with our Armies: for <hi>no King
is saved by the multitude of an host; a horse is a vain
thing for safety, neither shall he deliver any by his great
strength; but the eyes of the Lord are upon them that
fear him, upon them that hope in his mercies.</hi> 33 Psal.
16, 17, 18.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:57454:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Nay, the justice and righteousness of our Cause
will not always secure us of Success; for those
who have a very just Cause, may deserve to be
punished; and then God may justly punish them,
and deliver them into the hands of their Enemies:
God does not always determine what is Right
and Wrong by the events of War; for he is the
Sovereign Judge of the World, and may punish
a wicked Nation by unjust Oppressors, as he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
did the <hi>Israelites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Profession of the true Religion will not
always secure us, when our Sins cry for Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance:
When the <hi>Jews</hi> cried, <hi>The temple of the
Lord, the temple of the Lord;</hi> the Prophet told them,
<hi>They trusted in lying words; for will ye steal, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and commit adultery, and swear falsly, and burn
incense to Baal, and come and stand before me in this
house, which is called by my name, and say, We are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to do all these abominations?</hi> 7 Jer. 4,—10.
To glory in the profession of the true Faith, or
in a vigorous opposition to the Errors and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of Religion, when we are Atheists or
Infidels in our Lives, may make God punish us,
but is no reason on our part, why he should save
us; but true and sincere Repentance will save
us. We profess the sincere Faith of Christ, we
fight in a just Cause, if it be lawful to defend
our selves against the powerful Oppressor of the
<pb facs="tcp:57454:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Protestant, that is, the true Christian Faith,
and the Liberties of <hi>Europe;</hi> and we have no
reason to fear any thing but our sins: Let us but
reform our Lives, and put away the evil of our
doings, and our Arms will be as Prosperous, as
our Cause is Just: God will then <hi>gird our Princes
and soldiers with strength to the battel; will teach their
hands to war, and their fingers to fight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>5thly.</hi> Faith and Prayer are more powerful
than Arms; as it must necessarily be, if God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gives Victory and Success. This we learn
from the whole History of the <hi>Jews;</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> gives us a particular account
of the Power of Faith, <hi>11 Heb. 32, 33, 34. Of
Gideon, and Barach, and Sampson, and Jeptha, and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought
righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of
lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of
the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed
valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens.
Moses</hi> his Prayer was more powerful than
<hi>Joshua</hi>'s Arms; for <hi>when Moses held up his hands,
Israel prevailed; when he let down his hands, Amalek
prevailed,</hi> 17 Exod. 11. <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Prayer over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw
the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Army, when <hi>Rabshekah</hi> came
against <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and reproached them with their
Trust in God. We must not indeed expect such
miraculous Victories as God gave to <hi>Israel;</hi> but
<pb facs="tcp:57454:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this makes no difference; for the Power of
Faith and Prayer is the same still; and all Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is God's still, who gives Success as well by
invisible Means, and seeming Accidents, as by
the most visible interposal of a miraculous Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
For God gave <hi>Israel</hi> miraculous Deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
not because he could not save them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Miracle, but because he would make it vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to all the world, That he was their Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
But still God hears our Prayers, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
them; he is still the Saviour and Deliverer
of all those who trust in him, and hope in his
Mercy; and therefore the only sure way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
our Enemies, is to prevail with God by our
fervent and importunate Prayers for a Blessing
upon our Arms; to pray in Faith, in Hope, with
an entire dependance on God, and a perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation
to his Will: Thus <hi>Gideon,</hi> and <hi>Barak,</hi>
and <hi>David,</hi> and the Worthies of old, subdued
Kingdoms, waxed valiant in fight, and turned to
flight the Armies of Aliens; and there is no other
way that I know of, still: If God be still the only
Giver of Victory, Faith and Prayer is still the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
way to obtain Victory from God; and therefore
if we are cold and remiss in our Prayers; if we
do not pray at at all, or expect nothing from our
Prayers, let us not charge any ill success to ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb facs="tcp:57454:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or cowardize, but to our Infidelity and Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion;
and indeed this is the only melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Consideration in our present Circumstances;
if the Courage and Conduct of a Prince, if the
Bravery and Resolution of Soldiers, if a Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Army and Navy, if an Arm of Flesh
could give Victory, we have reason to hope
well; but if God go not forth with our Armies,
all our other Preparations are vain; and how
can we expect that, when we will not ask it, or
only mock God with some formal and customa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
addresses, without being concerned whether
he hears or no; or without expecting, or at
least without trusting and depending on his help?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6thly.</hi> But to encourage those good men, how
few soever there are among us, who have a great
sense of the Divine Providence, and a firm Trust
and Faith in God, to be very importunare in
their prayers for this Church and Nation, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
farther, That God many times has spared
a wicked people at the earnest intercessions of
some few good men. Thus at the intercession
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> God promised to have spared <hi>Sodom,</hi>
had there been ten righteous persons found in that
great City: God spared <hi>Israel,</hi> when they had
so provok'd him by their Idolatries, that he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to destroy them, only at the importunity of
<pb facs="tcp:57454:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Moses,</hi> as the Psalmist observes; <hi>therefore he said,
he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he
should destroy them,</hi> 106 Psalm 23. the Story of
which we have, 32. <hi>Exod.</hi> 7, 8. at another time,
when they had provoked God by their Idolatries
and Whoredoms with the Daughters of <hi>Moab,</hi>
and the Plague broke in among them, <hi>then
stood up Phineas and executed judgment, and the plague
was stayed, 25 Numb.</hi> And therefore when God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
his resolution to punish them, he forbad
his Prophet so much as to pray for them. 7. <hi>Jer.</hi>
16. And in 14. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. professes, That he
would not accept of any Intercessions for them:
<hi>Tho these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in
it, yet they shall deliver but their own souls by their
righteousness, saith the Lord:</hi> Which supposes, that
at another time, the Intercessions of these good
men would have prevailed; and that it is very
extraordinary for God to deny it.</p>
            <p>And if the importunate Prayers of a few good
men may obtain Victory and Success, and save
a Church and Nation; let every good man at
this time cry mightily to God, especially as the
Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> exhorts, <hi>Ye that make mention of the
Lord, keep not silence, and give him no rest, till he
make Jerusalem a praise in the earth, 62. Isa.</hi> 6, 7.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:57454:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>7thly.</hi> To add no more, and it is a very comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Consideration, God many times saved <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
for his own Names sake, when their sins pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
him to destroy them. 48. <hi>Isa. 9. For my
name sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise
will I refrain for Thee, that I cut Thee not off. 11. v.
For mine own sake, even for mine own sake will I do
it; for how should my name be polluted? and I will not
give my glory to another.</hi> Thus God assigns the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
why he did not destroy <hi>Israel</hi> in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
when they so highly provoked him.
<hi>I wrought for my name sake, that it should not be pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before the heathen, among whom they were, in
whose sight I made my self known unto them, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them forth out of the land of Egypt, 20. Ezek.</hi> 9.
That is, they were God's peculiar people, the only
worshippers of the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> whom he had
brought out of <hi>Egypt</hi> by a mighty hand, to make
his Name known in the world; and though they
never so much deserved to be destroyed, had he
then destroyed them, his own great Name would
have suffered with them; as <hi>Moses</hi> pleaded with
God; <hi>Wherefore should the Egyptians say, For mischief
did he bring them out to slay them in the mountains, and
to consume them from the face of the earth? 32. Exod.
12.</hi> And thus the Psalmist prays, <hi>Help us, O God
of our salvation, for the glory of thy name, and deliver us,
<pb facs="tcp:57454:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and purge away our sins for thy name sake; wherefore
should the Heathen say, Where is their God? let him be
known among the Heathen in our sight, by revenging the
blood of thy servants, which is shed,</hi> 79. Psalm
9. 10.</p>
            <p>And this is matter of hope to us, That tho our
sins are very great, yet God will not utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
us, but will send deliverance for <hi>his name
sake;</hi> for the sake of that holy Faith which is
professed among us; lest our Antichristian Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
should triumph and say, <hi>Where is now their
God?</hi> When the preservation of a wicked peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
is for the defence and honour of the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith, we have reason to hope, and good
men have a very powerful argument to plead
with God, That <hi>he will save us for his own Names
sake.</hi>
