         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I charge thee to be a ſlanderer, and a falſe accuſer of the Brethren, theſe words was never uttered by me, all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers and ſeducing by the Spirit of God is denyed, and witneſſed againſt, and thou art witneſſed againſt by the Spirit of God, that thou art ful of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome, froth, and filth, which is not worth raking up after thee; thy Heart is overcome with it, let it return into the Pit from whence it came, where the Frogs lodges, who are thy companions. Again, that which is ſpoken, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the breach of the Law in not diſcovering <hi>Coppinger,</hi> but concealing him, and letting him depart, is true according to the Law and thy evading it, by ſeeming to cover it, by <hi>Coppingers</hi> haſty departure, and the ſuſpenſion of the Lawes, thou ſaith, to that purpoſe, doth no whit prove the contrary, and had not your envy tranſported you beyond the bounds of equity, you would be aſhamed to publiſh ſuch a thing, but it's clearly ſeen whom you ſhout at, and whom you would devour, though you pretend the Juſuits, they are ſo near of kin to you, you can let them go, and after conference with them (as thou ſaith <hi>Cowliſhaw</hi> had with <hi>Coppinger)</hi> who confeſs themſelves to be ſuch, thou concealeſt them, and bring in their words to ſlander the innocent, and truth ever ſuffered under reproachful names and tongues, in which thou haſt not a little ſhare, thou fils up thy meaſure, and accordingly ſhal thou be rewarded.</p>
            <p>Thou ſaith, I except againſt thee for averring that the quakers are but the ſpawn of Romiſh frogs, Jeſuits, and Franciſcan Fryers, and to deny this is alledged that they came out of the North, and thou ſaith to come out of the North is a ſhrew'd ſigne of their badneſs, for the Scriptures ſpeaks, <hi>that out of the North an evil ſhall break forth.</hi>

               <hi>Reply.</hi> To prove that we came out of the Nort, and had never been out of Nation, and of our birth and habitations, doth ſufficiently confute thee, who made that thy ground to have proved by the information, that we were <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pingers</hi> acquaintance in <hi>Rome,</hi> for ſaiſt thou, thoſe two perſons which came to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> was moſt likely his two fellow <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Fryers, and here thy like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is another lye, and the Scripture doth not prove thy ſhrew'd ſigne, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it cover thee, nor hide thee, but upon thee will evill break forth,
