            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>The five yeares of King <hi>Iames,</hi> or the Condition of the State of ENGLAND, and the Relation it had to other Provinces.</head>
               <p>HOwsoever every Kingdome and Common-wealth may be both well and uprightly governed, and that good men may be the meanes to support it; yet there can be no such Common-wealth, but amongst the good, there will be even some evill persons: these, (whether by nature induced, or through envie and ambition, to the intent to satisfie their appetites, perswaded) doe oftentimes enter into actions repugnant unto the felicity of good Government and Common-wealths, and by evill causers and perverse deeds, doe secretly and underhand, seeke to hasten and set forward the ruine and decay of the same: These things, because they happen contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and beyond expectation are so much the more remarkable by how much they are suddaine, and unexpected. And from hence it cometh, that no state of government can be said to be permanent, but that oftentimes those are said to be good, are by little and little converted unto those that be evill, and oftentimes changed from worse to worse, till they come to utter desolation.</p>
               <p>Neither is this alone proper to our Common-wealth, but to all, nor to forraigne Kingdomes, but to our owne: for although His Majesty at His coming to the Crowne found us vexed with many defensive warres, as that in Ireland, that in the Low-countries, and almost publique against Spaine, auxiliarie in France, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in millitarie imployments, although he found it lacerate, and torne, with divers factions of Protestants, Papists, and others, from amongst whom, sprung some evill men, that endeavoured to set
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:111332:3"/>
into combustion the whole State, yet neverthelesse he established a peace, both honourable and profitable, with all neighbour Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and by relation through all Europe; so that neither our friends, nor our enemies might be either feared or suspected.</p>
               <p>After this generall peace was concluded, and the working heads of divers dangerous Papists were confin'd to a certaine course of life, that is, peace; they now petition for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>olleration, for releases of vexation, to have liberty of conscience, and forsooth, because they cannot have these things amongst them, they contrive a most horrible and devillish plot by gun-powder to blow up the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even the whole State and command of this Kingdome, and so at one puffe, to conclude all this peace, and by that meanes to procure an unruly and unseemly avarice of this setled government; and this not so much to establish their owne Religion, (for which purpose they pretended it) but to establish their owne power and preheminence, and to raise some private Families to greatnesse and dignitie, that so faction being nourished, and that jurisdiction esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, they might with great facility suppresse whom they please, and support their owne State. Thus may wee see that setled go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments doe cherish in themselves their owne destructions, and their own subjects are oftentimes cause of their owne ruine, unlesse God of his mercy prevent it.</p>

               <p>THis evill being discovered by the Lord <hi>Mounteagle,</hi> and overpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, divers discontents happened, some betweene the Civilians and Common Lawyers concerning Prohibitions; And for that there was one Doctor <hi>Cowell</hi> stood stifly against the Lord <hi>Cooke,</hi> divers discontents were nourished betweene the Gentry and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monaltie concerning Inclosure, and it grew out into a petty Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, which by the same was conjectured, not to happen so much

for the thing it selfe, as for to find how the people stood affected to the present State, whereby divers private quarrells, and secret com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustions were dayly breaking out, private families, one sided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another; and of these, Protestants against Papists, they thereby endavouring to get a head, and from small beginnings to raise greater Rebellions and discontents, shewed themselves heady, and speakes publickly, what durst not heretofore have beene spoken in corners; in outward appearance Papists were favoured, Masses almost publickly administred, Protestants discountenanced, disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest men honoured, those that were little lesse then Sorcerers, and Witches preferred, private quarrells nourished, but especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Scottish and the English Duells in every secret main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, divers, sects of vitious persons of particular Titles passe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished or unregarded, as the sect of Roaring-boyes, Boneven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Bravadors, Guarterers, and such like, being persons prodigall, and of great expence, who having run themselves in debt, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to run into faction to defend them from danger of the Law; these received maintenance from divers of the Nobility, and not a little as was suspected from the Earle of Northampton; which persons, though of themselves they were not able to attempt any enterprize, yet faith, honesty, and other good Arts being now little set by, and Citizens through lasciviousnesse consuming their estates, it was likely their number would rather increase then dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish. And under these pretences, they entered into many desperate enterprises, and scarce any durst walke the streets with safety after nine at night. So to conclude in outward shew there appeared no certaine affection, no certaine obedience, no certaine government amongst us.</p>
               <p>Such persons on whom the King had bestowed particular ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, either through pride of that, or their owne prodigality, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at high rates, and with their greatnesse brought in excesse of riot, both in clothes and dyet.

And for this purpose it was thought he had a hand in the contention that happened amongst the Hollanders and English concerning the Fishing, the Hollanders clayming right to have the Fishing in the Levant, and the English claiming right; upon this contention, they fell from clayme, to words of anger; from words of anger, to blowes; so that there dyed many of them, and a starre was left for further quarrell, but that it was salved by wise Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and the expectation of some disappointed.</p>

But His Majesty, being both wise and worthy, fore-saw the evill, and prevented it by Proclamation, by which meanes these clamors are stopt, and the injurie and offences of both parties redressed. The Irish seeing these sores, and hearing of these misdemeanours (for they have their intelligents here also) begin to

grow obstinate, and make religion a pretence to colour their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for which cause they stand out, and protest losse of life and goods, rather then to be forced from their opinion, being wavering and unconstant, rather thirsting for Rebellion, to the intent to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase their owne liberty, then peace; every new alteration gives occasion of discontent, and causes new complaints to be brought to the Kings eare, under pretence whereof they grew contemptuous to their Governors, and haters of the English Lawes.</p>

The match is concluded, and great expectation and provision for his coming over to performe the ceremonies of matrimony are made, at whose coming, many rumors are spread abroad. First, that the Spaniard tooke this to the heart, and therefore layd to doe him some mischiefe by the way.</p>
               <p>That there was a Ship of pocket Pistolls came out of Spaine, and that it was intended by the Papists to have made a Massacre. And that <hi>Northampton</hi> did utterly oppose this match, for he was as great an enemy to the Dutch and Protestants, as ever <hi>Cicell</hi> was their friend; and that many Priests were arrived, and such like; yet neverthelesse it was accomplished with great Pompe and state, all or the greatest part of the Nobility being there present, a Maske in the great banquetting-house, the Gentlemen of the Middle Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and other of <hi>Grayes</hi> Inne: a third besides three dayes Tylting, and running at the Ring, the King himselfe in person with the yong Prince that now is King, besides many other pastimes, both stately and becoming the dignity of a King.</p>
               <p>At this time there was a Proclamation against Verdingales, but to little purpose, for they rather increased greater, then dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed; For where a thing is once growne into a habit, it is hardly to be restrained.</p>
               <p>There was another Proclamation, upon the former report of the coming of a Ship of pocket Pistolls out of Spaine, that no man should carry a Pistoll in his pocket, nor any that should be lesse then a foot long in the barrell. About this time also the Papists were disarmed, and many strange rumors raised, which things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were uncertaine, I omit to relate them, being rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent unto state, then unto profit.</p>

               <p>This seemed strange unto the world, who tooke notice of the Earle to be of an able body, and likely to have many children, and to undertake any exploit for the good of the Common-wealth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed valuing this to be but an idle and vain rumour that was spread

               <p>In the meane time there is a motion betweene <hi>Rochester</hi> and her for a marriage, and since it was so, that the world had taken notice of their businesse, now to make some satisfaction, they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate a wedding betweene them: This motion was well liked of on both parties, but the obstacle remained, her husband was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and the Law would not permit her to have two husbands; whereupon shee growes the more eager of a divorce, that so shee might have a new hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>band, (for women of her disposition delight in change) and therefore renewes her complaint, advice is taken in the businesse whether such a thing may be had, there being no cause publique of adultery or dislike of the husband: Againe, it was a question whether the wife might sue a divorce or not, for that the Bill of divorcement was given to the husband, and not to the wife; many such like objections being disputed to and againe, at last it is concluded.</p>
               <p>That in case the Earle was so unable, as she reported, to execute the office of an husband, and that upon the search of twelve ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, shee appeared still to be a maid: It was lawfull that there might be a divorce, and the reason was two-fold, one that there might bee a frigidity <hi>quoad hanc,</hi> another that marriage was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for procreation sake, for which cause it was thought law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to sue a divorce.</p>
               <p>Upon this they proceeded to the search, twelve Matrons were empannelled, the day appointed, the search made, and the verdict returned, that she was a true maid: who should bring this to the eares of the King, but my Lord of Northampton, and so to the world, who growes jealous of fraud, doubting either corruption or deceit, (for it was vulgarly reported) that she had a child long before in my Lords absence; whereupon, some say this, some say that, and most that the Countesse was not searched; but that one of Sir <hi>Thomas Monsons</hi> daughters was brought in to be searched in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:111332:17"/>
her place, and so both Jury and Judges deceived. But how true this is, is not credible; yet neverthelesse they grant a bill of divorce, and now a seperation being had betweene them, the Earle in a great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content leaves the Court, and repaired to his house in Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire, and there lives a private life.</p>

               <p>The King being possessed of these things, and by him, (who to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:111332:23"/>
the judgment of the world was his greatest friend) took displeasure at it, so that by his countenance, one might have perceived his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; For the frowning of a King is like the roaring of a Lyon, terrible to the spectators and hearers, so that now they doubted not of their expectations to get him into the Tower, where being a Prisoner in the Kings disgrace, under the protection of one who more esteemed their favour then the Kings displeasure, sequestred from his friends, no intercourse suffered to come unto him, but what came from the <hi>Countesse, Northampton, Rochester</hi> and <hi>Weston,</hi> a fit agent to execute all manner of evills; why, to the judgment of the world, it is impossible that ever this evill should come to light. And thus being ranked up in their owne conceits, they run headlong to their owne destruction: for when there were but two persons privie to the act of murther, as in <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abell,</hi> it could not passe unpunished, but that <hi>Cain</hi> must be marked with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall marke of ignomie; how much lesse shall this go undisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, when there are so many privie to it?

himselfe of such a place (unexperienced) how to execute it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides tyed to many domestick businesses, desired to be excused; This seeming something strange and harsh, that he should neglect his owne good, and by this meanes incurre the displeasure of the King, and lose his expectations, makes some of his friends to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, others to stand in a maze.</p>
               <p>But in the conclusion, as he had justly deserved, by reason of his contempt, he is committed to the Tower, but not to be kept as a close Prisoner; but after, my Lord of Northampton and Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster being both of the Privie Councell, and in great favour at Court, sends unto the Lieutenant that he should keep him close Prisoner, and afterwards received by word of mouth from Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Monson,</hi> that he should not suffer any Letters, tokens or other things to be delivered unto him.</p>

               <p>After his death with much writing many entreaties and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, one <hi>Francklin</hi> was entertained into these actions, a man of a reasonable stature, crook shouldred, of a swarthy complexion, and thought to be no lesse a Witch then the two former, <hi>Gresham</hi> and <hi>Forman</hi>; This man was more imployed to make poysons fit to be administred by <hi>Weston</hi> then otherwise; for he was excellent in that art, to mitigate or increase their strength, so that sometimes a poyson should be a moneth ere it should worke: Verily evill acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons shall never want evill actors; and in all ages, Physitians, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries, Druggists, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now there is none to support him, no man to disswade him, his loosenesse with the Countesse gaules his conscience, and that it might be the more offensive to him, and make him the willinger to consent unto this motion, he is still prest with it, and that it is both unfit and unseemely, whereas on the otherside, if they marry, it will be both lawfull, honourable, and commendable, and the eares of the vulgar will be then stopt, and none dares bee so bold as to touch it; This carries shew of truth, so that what with his former affection, what with his present offence that he conceives at these courses, concludes the marriage: Times are appointed to conferre, how impediments might be avoyded, and what should be fitting to be dome in this behalfe.</p>

               <p>But what shall we say to a man lost?

Lastly, he concludes, that above all he should insinuate with him, to see how he stood affected to these procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and what words he uttered from a heart full of thirst with griefe and sorrow, must either speake or burst, and his service and diligence herein shall be rewarded with a thousand pounds.</p>
               <p>Whether it was the greedinesse of the reward, or the foolish de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire he had to give content to the Earle and Viscount, they being his only Favourers, or some other hope still unknowne, but he by this meanes is brought to his owne destruction, and so gives con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to conceale that which was intended. At his comming back, he repaires to Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi> under pretence to comfort him in his sorrow, and adviseth him to be more lightsome, and not to consume himselfe with griefe; by this meanes entring into further discourse, secretly insinuates into his intentions; Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a good opinion of him, and supposing all was done out of faith and honesty towards him, having by this meanes learned what he could of him, writes unto the Lord of Northampton a Letter to this effect:

               <p>At this time my Lord of Somerset little thought to have been laid in the Tower, and made heire of <hi>Overburies</hi> bed-chamber, but by this we may see, that all things are in the hands of God.</p>

               <p>And when the Lords should come to passe their voyces, my Lord of Canterburie amongst the rest made a speech to this effect: [That although many have beene the rumours and reports that had passed in these times, some of them shut up for uncertaine truths and flying fables; then entertained for approved truths; yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse such things are grounded upon reason, and for which, men of upright consciences have some occasion to speak, to have such either lightly valued or punished, was rather injustice then any way beseeming the equity of that Court: But in truth these whereof wee now speak are grounded upon some cause, and my Lords owne Letters make evident, that he hath done some things both against his owne conscience and meaning, meerly to attaine unto honour and soveraigntie, and to please the King:] And with that he pulls out a Letter written from my Lord to Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to this effect:

any attempt. This and much more being read, to some purpose he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and shewed how that those things were not meerly uncertaine, but even the actions that followed them did justifie them to be true. For there was never knowne to be so many Priests to come over into this Kingdome in so short a time as of late there had done, neither could he assure himselfe that my Lord was true hearted unto the State. Also he harboured such about him as would undertake to write in defence of the Gunpowder Treason.</p>

               <p>Many were the rumours that were raised of this man after his death. That he was a Traytor to the State, and that he was not dead, but carryed beyond Sea to blind the world, and the reason was, because he would be buryed at Dover, and not at London.</p>
               <p>Others say, that if he had lived, he would have beene the author of much stirre; many dislike him, and as was reported, even the King himselfe towards his latter end, which made him to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to these courses: but truly, he was a notable polititian, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed things more commodiously for the Papists then ever any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.

               <p>Now one of the greatest friends that <hi>Somerset</hi> had being dead, and himselfe still jealous of his safety, he begins to cast about how he might avoid the danger of the Law, for his intelligencers gave him notice of many desperate words that were uttered concerning <hi>Overburie's</hi> death; whereupon, finding the King in a good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:111332:33"/>
he moves him to this effect: That whereas it had pleased His Majesty to commit many things into his charge, and some of them proving something too waighty for him to undergoe, it was so, that ignorantly he run himselfe into a Praemunire, whereby he had forfeited to him both his lands, goods and libertie, and that he came now to surrender them all up into His Majesties hands, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it pleased him of his wonted favour towards him to grant him pardon for that, and many other offences that he had ignorantly committed. The King still bearing a good affection towards him, bid him draw his pardon and he would signe it: whereupon, he makes his repaire to Sir <hi>Robert Cotton,</hi> and entreats him to looke him a pardon, the largest he could find in former presidents; so he brings him one that was made by the Pope to Cardinall <hi>Woolsey.</hi> The effect of which was.</p>
               <p>That the King of his meere motion and speciall favour, did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all, and all manner of Treasons, misprisions of Treason, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Felonies and outrages whatsoever by the said Sir <hi>Robert Carre</hi> Earle of Somerset committed, or hereafter to be committed; with many other words to make it more ample and large according to forme, which he caused to be drawne and ingrossed, and brought it into the King. The King signed it; at length it comes to my Lord Chancellor's hand, he peruses it, and refuseth to let it passe the Seale. My Lord askes the reason, answer was made, That he could not justifie the doing of it, but that he should incurre a praemunire as well as himselfe. This struck Somerset to the heart, and now he was in greater doubt, then ever he was before, for still he is stung with feare to be touched with <hi>Overburies</hi> death, and so very pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively retires to White-hall, and there remaines.</p>
               <p>The King coming to London, my Lord Chancellor acquainted him with the Pardon, and shewed the King what danger he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, in case he had sealed it.

               <p>IN this yeare (1614) the King, by the entreaty of <hi>Somerset,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to go to Cambridge, and there was entertained with great solemnity, but amongst the rest, there was a Play called by the name of <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> that stirred up a great contention betweene the common Lawyers and the Schollers, in so much as their flouts grew unsufferable, but at last it was stayed by my Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and the explaining of the meaning.</p>
               <p>About this time it happened, that divers Citizens having reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered certaine summes of money in the Kings Bench, and thereof having had Judgement against the party Defendant, neverthelesse exhibites his Bill into the Chancery to have reliefe of the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffes at the Common-law, having already had Judgement of the same matter, there stands out, and disobeyes the Kings Processe; whereupon a Writ of Contempt issues against them, they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, committed to the Fleet, and there continue in their obstinacy; neverthelesse, not long after, upon some advice, they exhibit their Bill into the Star-chamber against my Lord, intending that hee ought not to intermeddle with any matter that were already deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined at the Common-law, and whereof a Judgement had been
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:111332:34"/>
passed: And this was ordained by the Statute of 4. <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 23<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now my Lord having laid them fast up upon a Bill exhibited before him, and Judgement being already given, that therefore my Lord had incurred a <hi>Premu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire,</hi> and humbly prayed reliefe in this case. Many were the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Lawyers concerning this matter; some stood on my Lord Chancellors side, some said the poore men had injury, and that they might justifie what they had done; and amongst many my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> stood out very stiffely, that my Lord Chancellor could not justifie that action. And thus it stood still in question whether my Lord be in a <hi>Premunire,</hi> or no.</p>
               <p>My Lord of Somerset continuing still in his loose courses, and utterly neglecting that severity that ought to be in a man of his place, besides the former suspitions and jealousies, gives occasion of others also, whereby the King doth more and more fall into dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: There being at this time about the Court a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that not long before had arrived from Travels out of France, his name was <hi>Villers,</hi> a Leicester-shire Gentleman, and of an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent House, who as well in respect of carriage, as of his countenance, was more remarkable then many others. On this man the King casts a particular affection, holding him to be the onely properest and best deserving Gentlemen of England; whereupon he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him into favour, bestowes a thousand pound upon him, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter adornes him with the title of Knighthood. And now he begins to grow every day more eminent then other, greater honours are bestowed upon him, as the dignitie to be Knight of the Garter, and Master of the Horse; places not common to every person, and so much the more remarkable, because they are bestowed upon him, being so yong in yeares, his wisdome is commended of the wisest, and his expectations greater then many that went before him.</p>
               <p>This stings <hi>Somerset</hi> to the heart, to see another step to his place,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:111332:35"/>
he more feares his subversion and downfall; wherefore hee goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to circumvent danger, and for this purpose sends into France to make away the Apothecary that administred the Phisicke that killed Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> endeavouring to get in all Letters and writings that had past concerning the businesse, and disgracing and discoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing all such as at any time once spake of the death of <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> to the intent that it might be concealed and kept close; but what God will have disclosed, sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>These things laying him open to the envie of the greatest; and Sir <hi>George Villers</hi> seeing his exceeding covetousnesse, having now the eares of the King, would oftentimes crosse his expectations, as it is credibly reported, and deceive him of many a bribe which hee hoped for, doing those things voluntarily, and for a thanke, which my Lord would not have spoken of without much money.

of the petition was, to let his Lordship understand, that whereas his Master had been committed to the Tower by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of <hi>Northampton</hi> and <hi>Somerset,</hi> and there languishing to death unnaturally; that if it pleased his Lordship to call one <hi>Weston</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, he might gather that out of him that might discover the whole plot and practise.

At last, when they heard that <hi>Weston, Turner, Francklin,</hi> and <hi>Yeluis</hi> were all hanged, and that they had confest the matter, the Countesse being brought before the Councell, confest the whole truth, but <hi>Somerset</hi> stood to it still, that he was not agent in it, and that these accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did nothing touch him, and therefore ought to be excused.</p>
               <p>Neverthelesse his lands and goods were committed to custodie, part to my Lord Treasurer, and part to others to the Kings use: The Money, Plate, and Jewels which he had heaped up together, amounted, by report, unto 200000. pounds, his lands 19000. pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> and the King bestowed many of them upon the Prince. There was little speech of this, in respect that both person and matter, wherein hee was agent, were both envied, and facine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, nei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The Arraignment was put off, and in the meane time Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> was set at liberty. This man had continued in the Tower now almost ten yeares a condemned person, for a plot intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Majesty at his first comming in; he bore a great envie against <hi>Somerset,</hi> because he had begged his lands of the King, and got it into possession, giving him many quips and taunts, during the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:111332:37"/>
time that he was in the Tower. These two accidents happening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond expectation, that the one being the speciall favourite of the King, the other a condemned man, the one imprisoned, the other set at liberty, gave great occasion of speech and rumour, and so much the more wonder and admiration, because of <hi>Rawleighes</hi> wit and policie.</p>
               <p>And this yeare also the Countesse of Shrewsbury, who was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for being privie to the escape of the Lady <hi>Arbella,</hi> was set at liberty, and the Earle her husband dyed, leaving the greatest part of his land unto his daughters; during all this time, that is, from <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Terme, unto the short vacation, betweene Easter and Trinity Terme, the Arraignment was put off; some attributed the cause to be, for because the Countesse was with child, and in the meane time was delivered of a daughter; some that further proofes of incertainties might be brought in; others to give them longer time to consider on the matter, and that it was a great favour; I say, these rumours being published amongst the people; at length the King authorised my Lord Chancellor to be High Steward of England for the time being, and joyned eight of his Judges with him for his assistance, <hi>viz.</hi> The foure Judges of the Kings Bench, my Lord Chiefe Justice of the Common Pleas, Justice <hi>Niccols,</hi> my Lord Chiefe Barron, and others of the Barrons, with power to call <hi>Somerset</hi> and the Countesse before them, to shew cause why they should not have sentence of death passed upon them for this offence committed, both against the Laws of the Land, and against the King, his Crowne and Dignity. So upon the foure and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of May, in this yeare 1616. There being a Seat Royall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at the upper end of Westminster-hall, a little short of the Kings Bench, and seats made round about it, for the rest of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices and Peeres to sit on, and a little cabbin built close by the Common Pleas, for the Prisoners, when they came from the Tower to be put to rest them in: They proceed to the triall after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.

This being done, after silence proclaimed, one of the Harrolds at Armes reaches the High Steward his Patent, and delivers it to the Clerke of the Crown to reade it; After Sir <hi>Ralph Conis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>After the Patent read, and proclamation for silence, and that the accusers should come in, the Prisoners were sent for by the Clerke of the Checker, whose office it was to attend the Prisoners: This being done, and the Prisoners placed at the Barre, Sir <hi>Henry Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw</hi> reades the Indictment, to which the Countesse pleaded guilty, and confessed the fact: But <hi>Somerset</hi> pleaded not guilty, and had time from ten of the clock at night to cleare himselfe; much was said, but to little purpose: At last, the Peeres having conferred of the matter, returne their verdict, laying their hands upon their brests, and swearing by their Honours (for they doe not m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A matter, that (though we are glad of so good a warrant) yet we should have done of our selves; for far be it from us by any strains, or wit of Arts, to seeke to play prizes, or to bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>First, my Lords, the course that I will hold in delivering of that which I shall say, (for I love order) is this: First I will speak some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the nature and greatnesse of the offence, which is now to be tryed, not to weigh downe my Lord with the greatnesse of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, but rather contrariwise to shew, that a great offence needs a good proofe. And that the King howsoever he might esteeme this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman heretofore as the Signet upon his finger (to use the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture phrase) yet in s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch a case as this, he was to put him off.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I will use some few words touching the nature of the proofes, which in such a case are competent.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I will state the proofes.</p>
               <p>And lastly, I will produce the proofes, either out of examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and matters of writing, or witnesses <hi>viva voce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the offence it selfe, it is of crimes next unto high Treason the greatest, it is the foulest of Felonies: It hath three degrees of stages. First, it is murther by impoysonment. Secondly, it is mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther committed upon the Kings prisoner in the Tower. Thirdly, I might say that it is murther under the colour of Friendship, but
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:111332:40"/>
that it is a circumstance morall, and therefore I leave that to the Evidence it selfe.</p>
               <p>For murther, my Lords, the first record of Justice which was in the world, was judgement upon a murtherer, in the person of <hi>Adams</hi> first borne <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e,</hi> and though it was not punished by death, but with banishment, and marke of ignominy, in respect of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenitors, or the population of the world, yet there was a severe charge given, that it should not go unpunished.</p>
               <p>So it appeareth likewise in Scripture, that the murther or <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> by <hi>Ioah,</hi> though it were by <hi>David</hi> respited in respect of great services past, or reason of State, yet it was not forgotten.</p>
               <p>But of this I will say no more, because I will not discourse, it was ever admitted and rancked in Gods owne Tables, that murther is of offences, betweene man and man next unto high Treason, and disobedience to Authority, which sometimes have been referred to the first Table, because of the Lieutenancie of God in Princes the greatest.</p>
               <p>For impoysonment, I am sorry it should be heard of in our Kingdome; It is not <hi>nostri generis, nec sanguinis peccatum</hi>; It is an Italian com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>it for the Court of Rome, where that person that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicateth the Kings of the earth, is many times really and materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally intoxicated and impoysoned himselfe. But it hath three cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, which makes it grievous beyond other matters: The first is, that it takes a man away in full peace in Gods and the Kings peace, that thinks no harme, but is comforting of nature with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>section and food, so that as the Scripture saith, His <hi>table is made a snare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second is, that it is easily committed, and easily concealed, and on the other side ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dly prevented, and hardly discovered; for murther by violence Princes have Guards, and private men have houses, attendants, and armes, neither can such murther be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but <hi>cum sonitu</hi> with some overt and apparant acts, that may discover and trace the offenders; but for poyson, the cup it selfe of

And therefore with great judgement did the Statute made that year touching this accident, made impoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment high Treason, because it tends to the dissolving of humane societie, for whatsoever offence doth so, is in the nature thereof high Treason.</p>
               <p>Now for the third degree of this particular offence, which is, that it is committed upon the Kings prisoner, who was out of his owne defence, and meerely in the Kings protection, and for whom the King and the State were a kind of respondent; it is a thing that aggravates the fault much, for certainly (my Lord of Somerset) let me tell you this, that Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> is the first man that was murthered in the Tower of London, save the murther of the two young Princes, by the appointment of <hi>Richard</hi> the third.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the offence, now to the proofes.</p>
               <p>For the nature of proofes, you may consider that imprisonment,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:111332:41"/>
of all offences is the most secret, even so secret, as that if in all cases of imprisonment, you should require testimony, you should as good proclaime impunity.</p>
               <p>Who could have impeached <hi>Livia</hi> by testimony, for the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning of the sigges upon the tree, which her husband was wont to gather with his owne hands; who could have impeached <hi>Parasetis</hi> for the poysoning of the one side of the knife shee carried with her, and keeping the other side cleane, so that her selfe did eat of the same peece of meat that they did, whom shee did impoyson.</p>
               <p>These cases are infinit, and need not to be spoken of the secresie of impoysonment, but wise men must take upon them in these secret cases <hi>Salomons</hi> spirit, that when there could be no witnesses, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the act by the affection: But yet we are not at our cause, for that which your Lordships is to trie, is not the act of impoyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for that is done to your hands; all the world by Law is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to say, that <hi>Overbury</hi> was poysoned by <hi>Weston,</hi> but the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion before you is of the procurement onely, and as the Law termeth it as accessary before the fact, which abetting is no more, but to doe or use any act or meanes which may aide or conduce to the impoisonment.</p>
               <p>So that it is not the buying nor the making of the poyson, nor the preparing, nor confecting, nor commixing of it, or the giving or sending, or laying of the poyson, that are the only acts that doe amount unto the abetment; but if there be any other act, or meanes done, or used to give opportunity of impoysonment, or to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the execution of it, or to stop or divert any impediments that might hinder it, and that it be with an intention to accomplish and atchieve the impoysonment; all these are abetments and accessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ore the fact: As for example, if there be a conspiracie to murther a man as he journeyeth on the way, and it be one mans part to draw him forth to that journey by invitation, or by colour of some businesse; and another taketh upon him to disswade some friend, of his company, that he be not strong enough to make his
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:111332:41"/>
defence; and another hath a part to hold him in talke till the first blow be given; all these, my Lords, without scruple are accessaries to the murther, although none of them give the blow, nor assist to give the blow.</p>
               <p>My Lords, he is not the hunter alone that lets slip the dog upon the Deere, but he that lodgeth him, and hunts him out, or sets a traine or trap for him, that he cannot escape, or the like.</p>
               <p>But this, my Lords, little needeth in this case, for such a chaine of acts of impoisonment as this, I thinke were never heard nor seene.</p>
               <p>And thus much of the nature of the Proofes.</p>
               <p>To descend to the Proofes themselves, I shall keep this course.</p>
               <p>First, I will make a narration of the fact it selfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I will breake and distribute the proofes as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, according to the distribution, I will produce them, or reade them to use them.</p>
               <p>So that there is nothing that I shall say, but your Lordships shall have three thoughts or cogitations to answer it.</p>
               <p>First, when I open it, you may take your ayme.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when I distribute it, you may prepare your answers without confusion.</p>
               <p>And lastly, when I produce the witnesses, or the examinations themselves, you may againe ruminate, and readvise to make your defence.</p>
               <p>And this I do because your memory and understanding may not be oppressed, or overladed with length of evidence, or with confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of order; nay more, when your Lordships shall make your answer in your time, I will put you in mind where cause shall be of your omission.</p>
               <p>First, therefore Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> for a time was knowne to have great interest and streight friendship with my L. of Somerset, both in his meaner fortunes, and after, in so much that he was a kind

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>talke of them, as they thought good. So I will undertake the time was, when <hi>Overbury</hi> knew more of the Secrets of Estate then the Councell Table did; nay, they were growne to such inwardnesse, as they made a play of all the world besides themselves, so as they had Cyphers and Jurgons for the King and Queene, and great men of the Realme, things seldome used, but either by Princes or their Confederates, or at the least by such as practise and worke against, or at the least, upon Princes.</p>
               <p>But understand mee, my Lord, I shall not charge you with disloyaltie this day, and I lay this for a foundation, that there was great Communication of Secrets betweene you and Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Overbury,</hi> and that it had relation to matter of State, and the great causes of this Kingdome.</p>
               <p>But my Lords, as it is a principle in Nature, that the best things are in their corruption the worst, and the sweetest wine maketh the sowrest vinegre; so fell it out with them, that this excesse, as I may say, of friendship ended in mortall hatred on my Lord of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersets part.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:111332:42"/>I have heard my Lord Steward say sometimes in the Chanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ry, that Frost and Fraud ends soule; and I may adde a third, and that is the Friendship of ill men, which is truly said to be conspiracie, and not friendship. For it fell out some twelve moneths or more before <hi>Overbury</hi> his imprisonment in the Tower, that the Lord of Somerset sell into an unlawfull love towards that unfortunate La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, the Countesse of Essex, and to proceed to a Marriage with <hi>Somerset</hi>; This Marriage and purpose did <hi>Overbury</hi> mainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne under pretence to doe the true part of a friend, for that hee accompted her an unworthy woman.</p>
               <p>But the truth was, <hi>Overbury,</hi> who (to speake plainly) had little that was sollide for Religion or morall vertue, but was wholly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest with ambition, and vain-glory, was loath to have any partners in the favour of my Lord of Somerset, and especially not any of the House of the <hi>Howards,</hi> against whom he had alwayes professed hatred and opposition.</p>
               <p>And, my Lords, that this is no sinister construction, will appeare to you, when you shall heare, that <hi>Overbury</hi> made his brags to my Lord of Somerset, that he had won him the love of the Lady by his Letters and industrie; so far was he from cases of conscience in this point.</p>
               <p>And certainely, my Lords, howsoever the tragicall misery of this poore Gentleman, <hi>Overbury,</hi> might somewhat obliterate his faults, yet because wee are not upon points of civilitie, but to discover the face of Truth before the face of Justice, for that it is materiall to the true understanding of the state of this cause. <hi>Overbury</hi> was naught and corrupt; the ballads must be mended for that point.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, when <hi>Overbury</hi> saw that hee was like to be possessour of my Lords Grace, which hee had possessed so long, and by whose greatnesse he had promised himselfe to doe wonders, and being a man of an unbounded and impudent spirit, hee began not onely to disswade, but to deterre him from the love of that

Lady, and finding him fixed, thought to find a strong remedie; supposing that hee had my Lords head under his girdle, in respect of communication of Secrets of State, as he calls them himselfe secrets of Nature, and therefore dealt violently with him, to make him desist with menaces of discovery, and the like: Hereupon grew two streames of hatred upon <hi>Over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Hereupon they had vari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>That was too weake, and they were so far from giving way to it, as they crossed it; there rested but two wayes of quarrell, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault, and poyson. For that of assault, after some proposition and attempt, they passed from it, was a thing too open and subject to more varietie of shame; that of poyson likewise was an hazardous thing, and subject to many preven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ions and caution, especially to such a working and jealous braine as <hi>Overbury</hi> had, except he was first fast in their hands; therefore the way was first to get him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a trap and lay him up, and then they could not misse the marke; and therefore in execution of this plot, it was denyed, that hee should be designed to some honourable imployment in forraigne parts, and should underhand by my Lord of Somerset be incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to refuse it; and so upon contempt he should be laid priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the Tower, and then they thought he should be close enough, and death should be his Bayle, yet were they not at their end, for

               <p>I will shew that a breach and malice was betwixt my Lord and <hi>Overbury,</hi> and that it burst forth into violent threats, and menaces on both sides.</p>

                  </gap>urther, that my Lord was like enough to repent where <hi>Overbury</hi> wrote, which was in the Tower of London, he was a Prophet in that; so there is the highest of the Secret.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I will shew you that all the Kings businesse was by my Lord put into <hi>Overburies</hi> hands, so as there is worke enough for Secrets, whatsoever they write them; and like Princes Confederates they had their Cyphers and their Jurgons.</p>
               <p>And lastly, I will shew you that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> was but a toy to say the malice was only in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oadjutor to that love, and the Lord of Somerset was as deepe in speaking ill of the Lady as <hi>Overbury:</hi> and againe, it was too late for that matter, for the bargain of the match was then made, and past; and if it had been no more then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move <hi>Overbury</hi> for disturbing the match, it had been an easie matter to have landed over <hi>Overbury,</hi> for which they had a faire way, but that would not serve.</p>
               <p>And lastly, <hi>periculum periculo vincitur,</hi> to go so far as an impoysonment, must have a deeper malice then flashes, for the cause must have a proportion in the effect.</p>
               <p>For the next generall head or proofe, which consists in the acts preparatory, or middle acts, they are in eight severall points of the Compasse, as I may terme them.</p>
               <p>First, there were divers devices and projects to set <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buries</hi> head on worke to dispatch him, and to overthrow him, plotted betweene the Countesse of Somerset, and the Earle of Somerset, and the Earle of Northampton, before they fell upon the impoysonment, for alwayes before men fix upon a course of mischiefe, there will be some rejection, but dye hee must one way or other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:111332:45"/>Secondly, that my Lord of Somerset was principall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiser, I must speake it, in a most perfidious manner, to set a traine and trap for <hi>Overbury</hi> to get him into the Tower, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they durst not attempt the impoysonment.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the placing of the Lieutenant <hi>Yeluis,</hi> one of the impoysonments was done by my Lord of Somerset.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that the placing of <hi>Weston</hi> the Underkeeper, who was the principall impoysoner, and the displacing of <hi>Carey,</hi> and the doing all this within the while of fifteene dayes after <hi>Overburies</hi> commitment, was by the meanes and countenance of my Lord of Somerset. And these were the active Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the impoysonment, and this was a businesse the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies power could not reach unto.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, that because there must be a cause of this Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to be acted, and chiefly because they would not have the Poysons worke upon the sudden, and for that the strength of <hi>Overburies</hi> natnre, or the very custome of receiving the Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons into his body, did overcome the Poysons that they wrought not so fast; therefore <hi>Overbury</hi> must be held in the Tower, as well as he was laid in; and as my Lord of Somerset got him into the Trap, so he keepes him in, and abuses him with continuall hope of liberty, but diverted all the true and effectuall meanes of his liberty, and makes light of his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and extremities.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, that not onely the plot of getting <hi>Overbury</hi> into the Tower, and the devises to hold and keepe him there, but the strange manner of the close keeping of him, being in but for a Contempt, was by the device and meanes of my Lord of Somerset, who denied his father to see him, denied his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that offered to be shut up close prisoners with him, and in effect handled it so, that he made him close prisoner to all his friends, and exposed to all his enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:111332:46"/>Seventhly, that all the advertisement the Lady received from time to time, from the Lieutenant or <hi>Weston,</hi> touching <hi>Ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
