            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ADMONITION TO THE READERS.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Am not insensible, that this little tract may seem to many, as a thing born out of due time. But they that have their spiritual senses exercised, and have seen and tasted, how jejune, and lifeless, and insipid the more publick exercises of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion somewhere are; will be easily convinced, that <hi>now</hi> they are called to double their diligence in family duties. And sith it is the great charge of Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders (<note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 6. 6, 7.</note>), to teach their Children, and their (<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 18, 19.</note>), housholds after them, and to (<note n="c" place="margin">Prov. 22. 6. the margin.</note>) catechize them in the way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb facs="tcp:41878:3"/>
they should go (whereunto the present exigencies, do more than ordinarily oblige them) it may not seem altogether unseasonable, to have added this plain and familiar help for their assistance.</p>
            <p>If therefore the earnest Calls of your suffering Ministers, the dreadful Charge of immortal souls, the strict Commands of your Maker and Judg, have engaged you in a resolution to set up this much neglected, but necessary and most beneficial exercise, let me ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise you to take this plain method. First, let those under your charge learn the Answers in the Assemblies Catechism, Then ask them these little Questions drawn from thence, and if they are at a loss, shew them out of which part of the greater Answer, they should have made return to the lesser Question. And this would be the more effectual, if you did run over all a second time, that they might observe the force of every clause and word in the Answer out of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, before you pass to examine them further on. Do not put them upon learning the Scriptures, till they ean get through all the Chatechism, and then examine them, how they can prove such
<pb facs="tcp:41878:3"/>
or such a clause in the answer, leaving the order that the Scriptures ly in. And as ever you desire to see the happy issue, of this most useful exercise.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> Let it be done solemnly, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point stated times for the weekly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming it; and if through necessity, or negligence, you should omit the season, watch for an opportunity speedily to do it, at least let it be done once the oftner the next week.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Set to every one his task, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their several capacities, and be punctual in requiring it, and shew your selves as zealous for the doing of Gods work, as you are for your own. But let not the explicatory Questions and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers be learnt without book by any, because this would be a needless burden, and they are in effect learnt already by them that can give an account of the Catechism it self.</p>
            <p>This I cannot omit, that it is my fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent desire, that not only the younger, but also the elder sort would become students of the Catechism, and (if able) commit it to memory. Beloved, would you know wherein you might rejoice the soul of your Minister, would you do me a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb facs="tcp:41878:4"/>
and refresh me in my tribulations for your sakes? why, herein you may do it. This would be no little pleasure to me, and (I am sure) no little profit to you. O the miserable defect of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, even among Professors themselves, for want of humility and diligence to commit to memory the principles of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?</p>
            <p>There is a twofold knowledg; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused and Distinct; The confused know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg is only to know the <hi>quod sit,</hi> that there is such or such a thing: and here, too often, many Professors rest. The distinct knowledg is, to understand the <hi>quid sit,</hi> and to be able to give a descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any grace, priviledg, or the like, and the difference of it from any other; and also the <hi>cur sit,</hi> or the ground or reason from the Scripture, why they do believe such or such a truth: and here men do (generally) unhappily fail.</p>
            <p>Beloved, my ambition is, that you should grow in grace, and the knowledg of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you should be clear and distinct in your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that there should not not be one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, but should be able to give a good account of his faith from the Word
<pb facs="tcp:41878:4"/>
of Truth. Verily, it is no small shame for men of years, under the Gospel (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for Professors, and this when we have yet such easie and excellent helps) not to be able to prove the main point of our religion from the Scriptures, and to give a solid description of faith, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, justification, sanctification, effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual calling, and the like; which will never be done to purpose, except they will learn a Catechism. If any think themselves above it, I fear it is from their pride and ignorance: for my part, I profess my self a learner. Well, will you learn with me? why should you not stir up each other, and engage together, that you will set to this work? O that I might but hear that you would so far gratifie the request of a Messenger of Christ, and his Embassador to you<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Most dearly beloved aud longed for, my Joy and Crown.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>MY hearts desire, and prayer for you is, that<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 1.</note> you may be saved. This is that which I have been praying, and studying, and preaching for these many years; and this is the end of my ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing, and suffering, and writing at this prsent time. God that knoweth all things, he knoweth that this is my wish; Oh that I could but come at your souls! And that this is the prize and the gain that I run for, that I might win souls. I seek not other gifts give me your hearts, let me but part between your sins and you; suffer me but to save you. Give me leave to carry you over to Jesus Christ, and I will not ask you any more. I will serve you gladly, I will suffer for you thankfully, so I may but save you. Do not wonder why I follow you so pressing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, why I call upon you so frequently; let not my importunity be grievous to you; all this is but to save you. Christ did not bethink his blood, and shall I bethink my breath, or ink, in order to your salvation? What pity is it, that any of you should miscarry at last, under the power of ignorance, or by a prophane negligence, or a formal and life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less profession of strict godliness.</p>
            <p>Beloved, I am afraid of you, lest (as to many of you) I have run in vain. I cannot but most thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acknowledg, that (considering the paucity of these that are saved) there are not a few of you who are the joy of your Ministers &amp; the glory of Christ. But it cannot be dissembled, that far the greater number give little ground to hope, that they are in
<pb facs="tcp:41878:88"/>
the state of salvation. And must not this be a pinching thought, to a compassionate teacher, to think, that he cannot for his heart perswade men but that the most of them will wilfully throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way themselves? Is it not a woful sight, to behold the devils driving a great part of our miserable flocks, (as they did once the herd of swine, the keepers themselves amazed looking on,) I say dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them violently down the hill, till they be choked in the water, &amp; drowned irrecoverably in the gulph of endless perdition? Ah miserable spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle! what through the loosness and sensuality of some, what throngh the wilful blindness of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, what through the halving, and cold, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomary religion of others, how great a number of our flocks is Satan like to carry utterly away from us, after all that hath been done to save them?</p>
            <p>Yet I cannot but call after them. Hearken unto me, O ye Children. How long will you<note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 4. 2.</note> love va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and follow after leasing, and<note n="b" place="margin">Jer. 7. 4.</note> trust in lying words? As the Lord liveth you are lost, except you turn:<note n="c" place="margin">Ezek. 18.</note> wherefore turn your selves and live ye. Ah how mercy woeth you! how it waiteth to be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to you! Hear, O sinners, hear. See you not how the merciful Saviour of the world stretcheth forth his hands all the day long, and spreadeth forth his wings, and calleth you as a hen doth her chicken? Hear you not the soundings of his bowels? he hath no need of you; yet how do his compassions melt over perishing sinners? his<note n="e" place="margin">Hos. 11. 8.</note> heart is turned within him, and shall not this turn your hearts? his repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are kindled together? and shall not this lead you to repentance?<note n="f" place="margin">Rev. 3. 20.</note> Behold, he standeth at the door and knocketh. O man wilt thou keep Jesus at the door, and lodg <hi>Barabbas</hi> in thy bosom? and prefer thy cruel lusts, before thy compassionate Lord? Oh his melting love to sinners! he<note n="g" place="margin">Isa. 55. 1.</note> calleth after them, he<note n="h" place="margin">Luk. 19. A1, 42.</note> weepeth over them, he<note n="i" place="margin">Prov. 1. 21, 22, 23.</note> cryeth to them; How long ye simple ones, will you love sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity?
<pb facs="tcp:41878:88"/>
               <note n="k" place="margin">Jer. 13. 27.</note> will you not be made clean? when shall it once be? why will you die? Turn you at my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you. Sinner, art thou not yet melted? Oh come in at his loving calls. Come out from thy sins: touch the scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of grace and live: why shouldest thou be<note n="l" place="margin">Psal. 2. 9, 12.</note> dashed in pieces by his iron rod? kiss the Son: why shouldst thou perish in the way? set up Jesus as thy King, lest he count thee for his<note n="m" place="margin">Luke 19. 27.</note> enemy, because thou wouldest that he should not reign over thee, and so thou be called forth and slain before him. Oh how dreadful will this case be to perish under the pitiful eyes of his mercy, and to die by the hand of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour! Oh double hell, to have thy redeemer become thine executioner! and the hand that was so long stretched forth to save thee, to be now stretched forth to slay thee! and the merciful heart of Christ himself hardned against thee, so as that he should call thee forth, and with his own hand hew thee in pieces, (as <hi>Samuel</hi> did <hi>Agag</hi>) before the Lord.</p>
            <p>But I have been too too long in prefacing to what I intended forthwith to have fallen upon: indeed I am apt to run out in matters that do so nearly touch upon your greatest concernments.</p>
            <p>Beloved, I despair of ever bringing you to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without sanctification: or possessing you of happiness, without perswading you to holiness. God knows I have not the least hope ever to see one of your faces in heaven, except you be converted and sanctified, and exercise your selves unto godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. This is that I drive at. I beseech you study to further personal godliness and family godliness.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Personal godliness. Let it be your first care to set up Christ in your hearts. See that you make all your worldy interests to stoop to him, that you be entirely and unreservedly devoted unto him. If you<note n="n" place="margin">Psal. 68. 21.</note> wilfully and deliberately and ordinarily harbour any sin, you are undone? See that you unfeignedly<note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 20.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:41878:89"/>
take the Laws of Christ, as the rule of your words, thoughts, and actions; and subject your<note n="o" place="margin">Psal. 119. 34.</note> whole man, members and mind faithfully to him. If you have not a true respect to<note n="p" place="margin">Psal. 11. 6.</note> all Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 13.</note> you are unsound at heart. Oh study to get the image and impress of Christ upon you within. Begin with your hearts, else you build without a foundation. Labour to get a saving change within, or else all external performances will be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. And then study to shew forth the power of godliness in the life. Let piety be your first and great business. 'Tis the highest point of Justice, to give God his due. Beware that none of you be a Prayer-less person: for that is a most certain disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of a Christless and<note n="q" place="margin">Psa. 14. 4 Job 15. 4.</note> a graceless person, of one that is a very stranger to the fear of God. Suffer not your Bibles to gather dust. See that you<note n="r" place="margin">Joh. 5. 39.</note> converse daily with the word. That man can never lay claim to blessedness, whose<note n="s" place="margin">Psa. 1. 1, 2</note> delight is not in the Law of the Lord. Let meditation and self-examination be your daily exercise, else the Papists, yea, the Pagans, will condemn us. That the short questions, which I have given you as a help to self-examination, may be daily perused by you, is the matter of my passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate request unto you. If ever you come to any growth in holiness, without the constant use of this practice, I am grosly deceiv'd; and therefore I would beseech, yea, even charge you, by the Lord, that you would daily examine your selves by these questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, till you have found a better help to this duty.</p>
            <p>But Piety, without Charity, is but the half of Christianity, or rather impious hypocrisie. We may not divide the <hi>Tables.</hi> See therefore that you do just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and love mercy, and let Equity and Charity run like an even thread, throughout all your dealings. Be you temperate in all things, &amp; let Chastity and Sobriety be your undivided companions. Let Truth and Purity, Seriousness and Modesty, Heavenliness and Gravity, be the constant ornaments of your
<pb facs="tcp:41878:89"/>
speech. Let patience and humility, simplicity and sincerity shine out in all the parts of your conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations. See that you forget and forgive wrongs, and requite them with kindness, as you would be found children of the most High. Be merciful in your censures, and put the most favourable constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon your brethrens carriage, that their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will reasonably bear. Be slow in promising, punctual in fulfilling. Let meekness and innocency, affableness, yieldingness, and courtesie, commend your conversations to all men. Let none of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations want that love and loyalty, that reverence and duty, that tenderness, care, and vigilancy, which their several places and capacities call for. This is throughout godliness. I charge you before the most high God, that none of you be found a swearer, or a lyar, a lover of evil company, or a scoffer, or malicious, or covetous, or a drunkard, or a glutton, unrighteous in his dealing, unclean in his living, or a quarreller, or a thief, or a backbiter, or a railer: for I denouce unto you from the living God, that<note n="t" place="margin">Prov. 13. 20.</note> destruction and damnation is the end of all such.<note place="margin">Ja<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. 5. 12.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="1">2. Family godliness. He that hath set up Christ in<note place="margin">Rev. 21. 8.</note> his heart, will be sure to study to set him up in his<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 9, 10.</note> house. Let every family with you be<note n="u" place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 19.</note> a Christian Church; every house, a house of Prayer; every<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 19. 20, 21.</note> houshold, a houshold of faith. Let every housholder say, with <hi>Johua,</hi>
               <note n="w" place="margin">Joh. 24. 15.</note> 
               <hi>I and my house will serve the Lord;</hi> and resolve with <hi>David,</hi>
               <note n="x" place="margin">Psal. 101 2.</note> 
               <hi>I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.</hi> Let me press upon you a few duties, which I have been long harping upon, but alas (I speak it to your shame) with many (too too many) of you, to little purpose in general.</p>
            <p>First, Let Religion be in your families, not as a matter by the by (to be minded at leisure, when the world will give you leave) but the standing business of the house. Let them have your prayers as duly as their meals; is there any of your families, but have time for their taking food? wretched man! canst
<pb facs="tcp:41878:90"/>
thou find time to eat it, and not find time to pray in?</p>
            <p>Secondly, settle it upon your hearts, that your souls are bound up in the souls of your family. They are committed unto you, &amp; (if they be lost through your neglect) will be required at your hands. Sirs, if you do not, you shall know, that the charge of souls is a heavy charge, and that the blood of souls is a heavy guilt. O man, hast thou a charge of souls to answer for, and dost thou not yet bestir thy self for them, that their blood be not found in thy skirts? wilt thou do no more for immortal souls, thèn thou wilt do for thy beasts that perish? What dost thou do for thy children, and servants? Thou providest meat and drink for them, agreeable to their natures, and dost thou not the same for thy beasts? Thou givest them medicines, and cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est them when they be sick, and dost thou not as much for thy swine? more particularly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let the<note n="y" place="margin">Isa. 34. 16 Joh. 5. 39.</note> solemn reading of the word and<note n="z" place="margin">Psal. 118. 15.</note> singing of Psalms, be your family exercises.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let every person in your families be duly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to an account, of their profiting by the word<note place="margin">So Christ singing with his family, <hi>viz.</hi> his Disciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 30 <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 18.</note> heard or read, as they be about doing your own business. This is a duty of consequence unspeakable, and would be a means to bring those under your charge, to remember and profit by what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. See Chists example in calling his family to an account, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 11. 13. 15.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Often take an account of the souls under your care, concerning their spiritual<note n="*" place="margin">Herein you must be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 10 36. 51.</note> estates, make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into their conditions, insist much upon the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and misery of their natural estate, and upon the necessity of regeneration and conversion, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their salvation. Admonish them gravely of their sins, incourage beginnings. Follow them ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nostly, and let them have no quiet for you, till you see them in a saving change. This is a duty of high<note place="margin">Mark 4. 10, 11.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:41878:90"/>
consequence, but (I am afraid) fearfully neglected, even by some that are godly. Doth not Conscience say, Thou art the man?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Look to the strict sanctifying of the Sabbath<note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 20. 19.</note> by all your housholds. Many poor families have little time else. O improve but your Sabbath days<note place="margin">Lev. 23. 3.</note> as diligently in labouring for knowledg, and doing your Makers work, as you do the other days in doing your own work, and I doubt not, but you may come to some proficiency.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let the<note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 92. 1, 2.</note> Morning and Evening Sacrifice of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Prayer, be daily offered up in all pour fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. Beware they be not found among the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies<note place="margin">Exod. 30. 7, 8.</note> that call not upon Gods name; for why should there be<note n="c" place="margin">Jer. 10. 25.</note> wrath from the Lord upon your fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies?<note place="margin">Luke 1. 9, 10.</note> O miserable families, without God in the world, that are without family Prayer! What have you so many family sins, family wants, family mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, what and yet no family Prayers? How do you pray with<note n="d" place="margin">Eph. 6. 18.</note> All prayer and supplication, if you do not with family prayer? Say not, I have no time. What hast thou all thy time on purpose to serve God, and save thy soul? and yet is this for which thou canst find no time. Find but a heart, and I will find time. Pinch out of your meals, and sleep, rather than want for Prayer. Say not, my business will not give leave. This is the greatest business to save thy self, and the souls committed to thee. Besides, a whet will be no let. In a word, the<note n="e" place="margin">Jer. 29. 11, 12.</note> blessing of all is to be got by prayer; and what is thy business without Gods blessing? Say not, I am<note place="margin">2 Sam. 7. 29.</note> not able. Use the<note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 25. 24, &amp;c.</note> one talent, and God will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease. Helps are to be had, till thou art better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But if there be no other remedy, thou must join with thine abler neighbour. God hath special<note place="margin">g Jam. 5. 14 to 19.</note> regard to joint-prayer, and therefore you must im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove family advantages for the performing of it.<note place="margin">Acts 12. 5. 10. 12.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Put every one in your families upon private<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 11.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:41878:91"/>
prayer. Observe whether they do perform it. Get them the help of a form, if they need it, till they are able to go without it. Direct them how to pray, by minding them of their sins, wants, and mercies, the materials of prayer. This was the practice of <hi>John,</hi> and of Jesus, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Set up Catechizing in your Families, at the least once every week. It was my parting, dying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, that you would set up and maintain this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty constantly in your families. Have you done it all accordingly? Cannot your consciences witness, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not your families witness you have not? Well, I thought my parting words would have done some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with you: I hoped the fervent request of a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Minister, would have prevailed for such a small matter with you. What, to this day without solemn catechizing in yonr houses? Ah, what a discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to your Teacher is this? Brethren, shall I yet prevail with you? will you reject me now also? O let me perswade you, before you take off your eyes from these lines, to resolve to set upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant exercise of this duty. Surely I have done and suffered more for you than this comes to: will you now deny me? I beseech you let me find, if ever God do again bring me to visit your houses, that the words of a suffering Minister have some power with you. I have sent you an help on purpose: what, shall all my perswasions be but speaking in the wind? and all my pains but labouring in the fire? Beloved, have you no dread of the Almighties charge, That you should<note n="h" place="margin">Deut. 6. 6, 7, 8, 9. &amp; 4. 9, 10. &amp; 11. 18, 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>teach these things diligently to your children, and talk of them as you sit in your houses,</hi> &amp;c. and<note n="i" place="margin">Pro. 22. 6 The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.</note> 
               <hi>train them up in the way wherein they should go.</hi> Hath God so commended <hi>Abraham</hi> that<note n="k" place="margin">Gen. 18. 19.</note> he would teach <hi>his children and houshold,</hi> and that he had<note n="l" place="margin">Gen. 14, 14. the margin.</note> many <hi>instructed servants,</hi> and given such a promise to him thereupon, and will not you put in for a share nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the praise, nor the promise? Hath<note n="m" place="margin">Luke 2. 46.</note> Christ
<pb facs="tcp:41878:91"/>
honoured catechizing with his presence, and will not you own it with your practice? Say not, they are careless, and will not learn. What have you your authority for, if not to use it for God, and the good of their souls? You will call them up, and force them to do your work; and should you not at least be as zealous in putting them upon Gods work? Say not, they are dull, and are not capable: If they be dull, God requires of you the more pains and patience; but so dull as they are, you will make them to learn how to work; and can they not learn as well how to live! Are they capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the mysteries of your trade, and are they not capable of the plain principles of Religion? well, as ever you would see the growth of religion, the cure of ignorance, the remedy of prophaness, the downfall of error, fulfil you my joy in going through with this duty.</p>
            <p>I have been too long already, and yet I am afraid my letter will be ended before my work be done. How loth am I to leave you, before I have prevailed with you to set to the work to which you are here directed will you pass your promise? will you give me your hands? Oh that you would! you cannot do me a greater pleasure. Ask what you will of me. See if I will not do as much for you. Oh that your families might be a joy to me, as that twice noble Ladies to <hi>John;</hi> who professes he had no greater joy, then to find her children walking in the truth! Beloved, why should you not give the hand one to another, &amp; mutually engage each to other, for more vigorous and diligent endeavours, in promoting fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily godliness. I must tell you, God looks for more than ordinary from you, in such a day as this. He expects that you should do, both in your hearts, &amp; in your houses, somewhat more than ever, under these his extraordinary dispensations; my most dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>beloved,</hi> mine own bowels in the Lord, will you sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the longings of a travelling Minister? will you
<pb facs="tcp:41878:92"/>
answer the calls of divine providence? would you remove the incumbent, or prevent the impending calamities? would you plant nurseries for the Church of God? would you that God should build your houses, and bless your substance? would you that your children should bless you? that your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should bless you? Oh then set up Piety in your families as ever you would be blessed, or be a blessing; let your hearts and your houses be the temples of the living God, in which his worship (according to all the forementioned directions) may be, with constancy reverently performed. Pardon my prolixity, and importunity in so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest pursuing of you, I am yet afraid I have done too soon, and shall end without my errand. The Lord God perswade you. To him I turn me; for I am well assured he can prevail with you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O</hi> Father of Spirits, that hast set me over thy flock to watch for their souls as one that must give an account. I have long studied thy will, and taught in thy name, and do unfeignedly bless thee, that any have believed my report. I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me, and they have received them. I have manifested thy name unto them, and they have kept thy word. And now I am no more with them, but I come unto thee: Holy Father, keep them through thine own name, for they are thine. As they have kept the word of thy patience, so keep thou them in the hour of temptation. They are but a flock, a little and a helpless flock: but thou art their shepherd, suffer them not to want. Do thou feed them and fold them. Let thy rod and thy staff comfort them, and let not the beasts of prey fall upon them to the spoiling of their souls.</p>
            <p>But what shall I do for them that will not be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I have called after them but they would not answer. I have charged them in thy name, but they would not hear. I have studied to speak perswasively to them, but I
<pb facs="tcp:41878:92"/>
cannot prevail. Yea, I said I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain, yet I cannot give them over, much less may I give thee over. Lord perswade <hi>Japhet,</hi> to dwell in the tents of <hi>Shem.</hi> Lord compel them to come in, and lay the hands of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon them, as thou didst on lingring <hi>Lot,</hi> and bring them forth, that they may escape for their lives, and not be consumed. Lord, I pray thee, open their eyes that they may see, and lay hold upon their hearts by thine omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent grace. Do thou turn them, and they shall be turned. O bring back the miserable captives, and suffer not the enemy of mankind to drive away the most of the flock before mine eyes, and to deride the fruitless endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of thy labourers, and boast over them, that he can do more with them, though he seek to ruin them, than all the beseechings, counsels, and charges of thy servants that seek to save them. Lord, if I could find out any thing that would pierce them, that would make its way into their hearts, thou knowest I would use it. But I have been many years pleading thy cause in vain. O let not these endeavours also be lost. O God, find out every ignorant, every prophane sinner, every prayerless soul, and every prayerless family, and convince them of their miserable condition, while without thee in the world. Set thy image upon their souls, set up thy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in their families. Let not pride, ignorance, or sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, keep them in neglect of the means of knowledg. Let thine eyes be over the place of my desires for good, from one end of the year to the other end thereof. Let every house therein be a seminary of Religion, and let those that cast their eyes upon these lines, find thee sli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in by the secret influence of thy grvce into their hearts, and irresistibly engaging them to do thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
