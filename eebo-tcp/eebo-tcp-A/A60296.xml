            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Sir Arthur Haſilrig's MEDITATIONS. OR, <hi>The Devil looking over Durham.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Here am I? what ſhall I be?—where ſhall I meet my good fellows?—By the figure of 5—at the Devil—will they meet me? What, all Traytors! no body reſenting theſe Grand Priviledges of Our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo infringed and violated by the conſent of the whole Nation? Wherefore did I purchaſe ſuch a vaſt Eſtate of Deans and Chapters Lands? Why have I merited a great name in the ruine of three Kingdoms, if it muſt be in the power of any body to queſtion it? Did not I bid defiance to old <hi>Oliver,</hi> whom I knew as much concerned in this lamentable Account as my ſelf, becauſe I knew there was no ſheathing of the Sword?</p>
            <p>Well, what I want in wiſdome and courage, I will ſupply in <hi>Perjury and impudence,</hi> but yet that will not ſerve the turn; is there no remaining ill qualities which the Kingdoms have not talled of? Had Sir <hi>Henry Vene</hi> again, for all our former diſſentions, and the irremediable distractions among Atheiſtical Logger-heads, I would intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any Gallimaufry of Government, but I would diſappoint the longing and juſt Expectation of a Settlement.</p>
            <p>Do you hear me! I am quarrelled at for ſeveral things, <hi>viz.</hi> Why ſhould the Biſhoprick of <hi>Durham</hi> be confer'd on a Man-ſlayer? Beloved, I ran away from the <hi>Devizes</hi> with all the celerity and ſpeed imaginable, which Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> will bear witneſs to; if I kill'd any man, it was in Effigie, or when <hi>I</hi> lately ſtabb'd a Picture at <hi>Wimbleton; I</hi> am hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſorry <hi>I</hi> can do that poor Girle no more favour: Oh <hi>I</hi> could with! But however, I will marry my Son and Heire to <hi>Frances Rich,</hi> becauſe I am ſure of a ſtrong party upon old <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s ſcore, and now <hi>Lambert</hi> and they are all one; and by the aſſurance of all theſe Intereſts, ſhall not I be Sir <hi>Arthur?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the increaſe of my Temporall eſtate, I referre you to Mr. <hi>Collingwoods</hi> caſe, whom I ruined in deſpight of <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> Noſe, upon the conſciouſneſſe of his Arbitrary Uſurpation; There was Verdict upon Verdict againſt me, but that ſignifies nothing againſt a <hi>R—P Reſolve.</hi> I hope I have ſo diſabled him, that I ſhall never hear more of that inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
            <p>I muſt now begin to exerciſe a vertue (which a moderate Fortune could not teach me) called Patience; would I were again in <hi>Portſmouth.</hi> I did not near Mr. <hi>Burgeſſe</hi> ſpeak a word or it there, no nor at the <hi>Houſe:</hi> my Honeſty and his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity are alike compenſable; He muſt not be longer an <hi>Eaton</hi>-Colledge-Fellow, nor I any longer of the Councill of State, and can you blame me to be angry at this diſaſter?</p>
            <p>Who will take the pains to innumerate my Vertues? though I cannot aſſure him now the thanks of the <hi>Houſe,</hi> bee ſhall have a Royaliſts Eſtate, <hi>gratis,</hi> upon the ſale of Sir <hi>George Booth's</hi> Lands, What ſhall I ſay? Would any man have believed ſuch a thing as divine Juſtice, that has lived 18 years uncontroulable and unqueſtionable to the Laws? Muſt I that pull'd down the Gates of the City of <hi>London,</hi> commanded their Walls to be broken down, that ſeverall breaches might be made, and put that violence upon them, which no Engliſh Prince in his utmoſt fury ever offered the City, forgo that kind of <hi>Omnipotency?</hi> I will rather run after <hi>Lambert</hi> and own the <hi>Commitee of Safety,</hi> and three or four times ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the Covenant.</p>
            <p>I am ſo vexed, that in ſhort, if cannot be revenged on you all, i'le be ſuddenly revenged on my ſelf.</p>
