            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>I will praise Thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart; and I will glorifie Thy Name for evermore: For Great is Thy Mercy towards me; and Thou hast deliver'd my Soul from the Lowest Hell.</hi> Or (as it is in the Margin) from the <hi>Grave.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not worth our while to enquire, what particular Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from an Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Danger that was, which King <hi>David</hi> here expresseth, in very Vigorous and Emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Words, his thankful Sense of. 'Tis enough to observe to you, that it was from a Design of <hi>Uillains</hi> upon his Life. This the next Verse sheweth: <hi>O God, the Proud are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen up against me, and the Assemblies of Violent men have sought after my Soul, and have not set Thee before them.</hi> And, the Deliverance we are now met to Commemorate, being of the same nature; it being from an Horrible Conspiracy of Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirsty
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55682:4"/>
People, both Foreigners and our own Countrymen, against our King and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; His <hi>Majesty</hi> from a Barbarous <hi>Assassmation,</hi> and all his good <hi>Subjects</hi> not only from the Loss of <hi>him,</hi> who is the very <hi>Breath of our Nostrils,</hi> but also from a most Formidable <hi>Invasion</hi> ready to follow it: I say, <hi>this</hi> being the Deliverance which God Almighty, in His undeserv'd and infinite Goodness, hath <hi>now</hi> sent us, I take the Words I have read to you, to be a Subject very proper to Employ our Thoughts on, upon this joyful Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion. <hi>I will Praise Thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart, and I will Glorifie Thy Name for evermore: For Great is thy Mercy towards me; and Thou hast deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered my Soul</hi> (or <hi>Life) from the Grave.</hi> Or, Great is Thy Mercy towards me, <hi>in delivering</hi> my Life from the Grave.</p>
            <p>The Return which this Pious King <hi>here</hi> makes to his Great Deliverer, was the Engaging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to <hi>Praise Him</hi> for his Deliverance <hi>with all his heart,</hi> and <hi>to Glorifie His Name for evermore.</hi> And the Example of this as Good as Great Man, are <hi>We</hi> bound to follow; tho' we need no Example to excite us to make the same Return for <hi>Our</hi> Deliverance, which is as great a one as <hi>his</hi> could be; it being a most necessary and indispensable Duty, thus to Express our Gratitude, for far less
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55682:4"/>
Expressions of the Divine Grace and Favour.</p>
            <p>In the handling of these words, I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to shew,</p>
            <p n="1">I. What is implied in <hi>Praising God with all our hearts, and Glorifying His Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. That we are under the most <hi>necessary</hi> Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation thus to do, for our Deliverances, and, consequently, for our other Blessings.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What is implied in <hi>Praising God (the Lord our God) with all our hearts, and Glorifying His Name.</hi> I joyn these two together, because they are one and the same thing; as God Himself saith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 23. <hi>Whoso offereth Praise, Glorifieth me.</hi> And Glorifying God's Name is expressed by <hi>Singing forth the honour of his Name,</hi> and <hi>making His Praise glorious,</hi> Psal. 66. 2.</p>
            <p>I need not inform those, who are not grosly ignorant of the Divine <hi>Nature,</hi> that 'tis impossible to make any Addition to the Divine <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Praise.</hi> There is no greater Contradiction, than that the Glory of an infinitely-Glorious Being is capable of the least augmentation or diminution. But if a <hi>greater</hi> could be, it would be <hi>this,</hi> that it lieth in the power of any <hi>Creature</hi> to add there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55682:5"/>
or lessen it. To <hi>Glorifie</hi> God, therefore, is to make His Glory (His Essential Glory) to be more <hi>known. observ'd,</hi> and <hi>acknowledg'd.</hi> And by His Essential Glory, His Glorious <hi>Perfections</hi> are to be understood; such as His Power, Wisdom, Righteousness, Holiness, and Goodness. Thus doth God Almighty Glorifie <hi>Himself,</hi> namely, by <hi>displaying</hi> His Perfections, and making Men and Angels behold them, in their Admirable Effects. And Rational Beings do Glorifie Him, by <hi>declaring</hi> such Effects, and their affecting <hi>Sense</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>When it is said, That God in all His Actings designeth His own Glory, we are to take notice, that the Glory He designeth to Himself is not a Consequent of, but the self-same thing with, the <hi>Illustration</hi> of His 'foresaid Perfections, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them known and manifest in various Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Exercises of them. The Glory He aims at, is, the making His Intelligent Creatures to feel in themselves, and to observe in other Beings, His Perfections in their Productions. And 'tis absolutely impossible for any Creature, to give Glory to God otherwise, than by rendering His Glorious Perfections more conspicuous, which are much Eclipsed and Obscured by the Sins of Men. In which sence Sinners are said to disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God, and to rob Him of His Glory, and to <hi>turn His Glory into Shame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:55682:5"/>
Having thus explain'd the Notion of <hi>giving Glory and Praise to God,</hi> I proceed to shew what is <hi>implied</hi> therein. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> It implieth a <hi>strong Belief</hi> of our being <hi>Principally</hi> obliged to God Almighty, for our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances, with all other Blessings; and obliged to none but Him otherwise than as His Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> A <hi>grateful Sense</hi> of our Unspeakable Obligations to Him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st,</hi> It implieth a <hi>strong Belief</hi> of our being <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally</hi> Obliged to God for our Deliverances, &amp;c. and to none but Him otherwise than as His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments. As those who are acquainted with, and do believe the <hi>H. Scriptures,</hi> cannot doubt but that God is All in All to the whole Universe; that the most excellent Creatures are perfectly dependent things, things <hi>immediately</hi> dependent on their Creator, both for their <hi>Well-being</hi> and their <hi>Continuance</hi> in being; that all their Powers and Abilities are from Him, and preserv'd by Him, so all hearry <hi>Theists</hi> must acknowledg this, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being more knowable by <hi>Natural</hi> Light. And therefore <hi>Tully</hi> stuck not to pronounce <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> an arrant <hi>Atheist,</hi> because tho' he profess'd to believe the Existence of a God, he deny'd the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55682:6"/>
Divine Providence, and that the Affairs of Men are under His Care and Government.</p>
            <p>And as to Deliverances from Open Violence and Secret Conspiracies, and Successes of War, nothing is better known, than that the <hi>Pagans</hi> who retein'd any Sense of Religion, have always ascrib'd them to the Protection and Assistance of their Gods. Even those brutish Idolaters the <hi>Philistins,</hi> upon the slaying of their great Enemy King <hi>Saul,</hi> and vanquishing his Forces, did shew to whom they acknowledg'd themselves Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for this great Victory, by <hi>putting his Armour in the House of their Gods, and fastning his Head in the Temple of Dagon,</hi> 1 Chron. X. 10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Giving Glory and Praise to God for Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances and other Blessings, implieth a <hi>grateful Sense</hi> too of our being Obliged to Him for them. The meer Belief hereof, I need not say, is a most insignificant thing without <hi>this.</hi> And 'tis equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly necessary to express this Sense, by <hi>Praising Him with joyful Lips,</hi> and by <hi>Living to His Praise and Glory.</hi> Nor can we glorifie and praise Him <hi>with all our hearts,</hi> but by joyning these two toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And therefore <hi>Offering Praise,</hi> and <hi>Ordering the Conversation aright,</hi> are conjoyn'd by the <hi>Psalmist</hi> in the words following those forecited ones, <hi>He that offereth Praise, Glorifieth Me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:55682:6"/>
As to the <hi>former</hi> of these Expressions of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, what Noble Strains do we find of Praise and Thanksgiving, in the <hi>H. Scriptures,</hi> and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the <hi>Psalms!</hi> As, <hi>Bless the Lord O my Soul, and all that is within me Bless His Holy Name. Bless the Lord, O my Soul, and forget not all His Benefits. Who forgiveth all thine iniquities, and healeth all thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases. Who redeemeth thy Life from destruction, and Crowneth thee with loving kndness and tender mercies,</hi> Psal. 103. beg. <hi>I will extoll Thee my God, O King, and I will-Bless Thy Name for ever and ever. Every day will I Bless Thee, and I will Praise thy Name for ever and ever. Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; and His Greatness is unsearchable. One Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration shall declare Thy Works to another, and shall Praise Thy mighty Acts. I will speak of the glorious Honour of Thy Majesty, and of Thy wondrous Works. And men shall speak of the might of thy Terrible Acts, and I will declare Thy Greatness. They shall abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly utter the memory of Thy great Goodness, and shall Sing of Thy Righteousness;</hi> Psal. 145. <hi>1st</hi> to <hi>7th</hi> V. And so he goes on admirably to the end of the Psalm.</p>
            <p>But could we sing God's Praises with the Tongues of <hi>Angels,</hi> we shall be far from Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Him, from <hi>giving Him the Glory due unto His Name,</hi> (as we are called upon to do) except
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55682:7"/>
we <hi>live</hi> them too; except we are led by the Great things God doth for us, to a more careful Observance of His Righteous Laws. The Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the Disobedient do Him no Honour, since the Lives of such do give the Lye to their Tongues. Such will never be believ'd to Praise God in <hi>Earnest,</hi> for it may well be concluded, that the Principle which will make a man Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in his Praises, must needs excite him to <hi>real</hi> Expressions of Thankfulness, no less than <hi>Verbal</hi> ones. It is not to be imagin'd, that those who take but little Care, to do what is acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable in the Sight of God, and stick not at wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and deliberately Offending Him, can have any great Sense of their being much Obliged to Him.</p>
            <p>And God doth lay so great weight, upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glorified by our Lives, that <hi>this</hi> is His great design in obliging us as He doth. And we read particularly of <hi>Deliverances from our Enemies,</hi> that they are sent us for <hi>this</hi> end, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 74. <hi>That we being delivered out of the hands of our Enemies, may serve Him without fear, in Holiness and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness before Him, all the days of our Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>David,</hi> upon his Deliverance (as 'tis very probable) from the imminent danger he was in from his Son <hi>Absalon,</hi> brake forth into such <hi>Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:55682:7"/>
as these; <hi>I love the Lord, because He hath heard my Voice and my Supplication: Because He hath inclined His Ear unto me, therefore will I call upon Him as long as I live.</hi> I will lead a more devout and religious life. <hi>Thou hast delivered my Soul from death, mine Eyes from tears, and my Feet from falling. I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living.</hi> Or, <hi>therefore</hi> I will do so; I will be more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul than ever, to walk uprightly before Him. <hi>What shall I render unto the Lord for all His Benefits towards me? I will take the Cup of Salvation, and call upon the Name of the Lord. I will pay my Vows unto the Lord, now in the presence of all his People. O Lord, truly I am Thy Servant, I am Thy Servant, Thou hast loosed my Bonds.</hi> Or, by thy having set me free from the fear of mine Enemies, Thou hast laid a new Obligation upon me, to be Thy Servant, Thy <hi>faithful</hi> Servant. The <hi>Israelites</hi> (as the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist</hi> observes) remembred that <hi>God was their Rock, and the High God their Redeemer;</hi> and they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred this in Songs of Praise to their Rock and Redeemer; He had enough of these from them; but <hi>their Hearts not being upright with him,</hi> as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>and they not being stedfast in His Covenant,</hi> 'tis said, <hi>they flattered Him with their mouth, and lyed unto Him with their Lips.</hi> All their Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving Songs (and Sacrifices too) were of no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55682:8"/>
account with God than meer Mockeries, and were <hi>in themselves</hi> no better. We our selves can have no better Opinion of the Thanks we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from those we have Obliged, tho' they are never so solemn and seemingly hearty, when at the same time we observe an Aversion in them, to answer our reasonable Expectations from them.</p>
            <p>Tho' we read of but <hi>one</hi> Fault charged upon that Excellent Prince <hi>Hezekiab,</hi> namely, <hi>that his Heart was lifted up;</hi> that he had a too high Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of himself, by means of his <hi>being magnified in the sight of all Nations,</hi> upon the most Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Deliverance which God had sent him, from an irresistible Invasion; yet, upon this <hi>single</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, he is said <hi>not to have render'd according to the Benefits done unto him;</hi> and it follows, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>there was Wrath upon him, and upon his People,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 25. Therefore God punish'd <hi>him,</hi> and took this occasion to be very severe upon his <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> for former Provocations. And this leads me to shew,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> That we are under a necessary (the most absolutely necessary) Obligation, to <hi>Praise the Lord our God with all our hearts, and to Glorifie His Name for evermore</hi> (as these Phrases have been expounded) for all God's Blessings in general,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55682:8"/>
and for our <hi>Deliverances from our Enemies</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
            <p>I will not here insist upon God's <hi>Command,</hi> whose Will and Pleasure must <hi>as such</hi> be obey'd, but upon those <hi>Reasons</hi> on which this Command is founded. And those Reasons do speak this Duty, not only a Branch of <hi>Natural</hi> Religion, but as clearly discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to be a Duty of the most indispensable neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, <hi>at first sight,</hi> as is any corporeal Object appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to our <hi>outward</hi> Senses: So that no man in his <hi>Wits</hi> can doubt, whether he be bound to glorifie God both with his Lips, and by his Life, for the great Expressions of His Goodness to him.</p>
            <p>Now the Reasons on which our Obligation hereto is grounded, over and above the <hi>Command</hi> of God, and which are the Foundation of God's <hi>willing</hi> to be glorified by us, are these two.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thus to do is the most <hi>comely,</hi> the most <hi>fit, just,</hi> and <hi>good</hi> thing in <hi>it self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is the most <hi>beneficial</hi> and <hi>good</hi> thing <hi>for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis the most <hi>comely,</hi> the most <hi>fit, just,</hi> and <hi>good</hi> thing in <hi>it self. Praise is comely,</hi> saith the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist, Psa.</hi> 147. 1. And <hi>Praise is comely for the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, Ps.</hi> 33. 1. Gratitude is highly <hi>becoming, meet, fit,</hi> and <hi>good</hi> in its own nature, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering it as an Instance of <hi>Obedience.</hi> And we have every whit as lovely an Idea of <hi>Gratitude,</hi> as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55682:9"/>
we have of <hi>Obedience,</hi> not to say a more lovely, Gratitude being the Principle of the most lovely Obedience. 'Tis as <hi>disbecoming</hi> and <hi>unjust,</hi> on the other hand, to be <hi>ungrateful,</hi> as to be disobedient. I mean, the <hi>Notion</hi> of Ingratitude speaks it to be as unjust and vile a thing, <hi>abstractively</hi> consider'd, as the <hi>Notion</hi> of Disobedience, so consider'd, speaks <hi>it</hi> so to be. It is indeed commonly said, <hi>Such a one is not bound in</hi> Justice <hi>to do this or that, but he is in</hi> Gratitude. <hi>I cannot say this is</hi> dishonest <hi>dealing, but 'tis</hi> disingenuous. But we do <hi>ill</hi> to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Justice and Gratitude, and between Disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity and downright Dishonesty, otherwise than by making Gratitude a distinct <hi>Species</hi> of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and Disingenuity of Dishonesty and Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. These differ only as one is more Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive than the other. Whatsoever is an Instance of Ingratitude, is so likewise of Injustice; tho' every Instance of Injustice is not so of Ingratitude: And no man can doubt, that 'tis Unjust to be Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, since it cannot be question'd whether it be Injustice to deny a <hi>Due;</hi> but Gratitude is <hi>due (naturally</hi> due) to every Benefactor: for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Kindnesses are call'd Obligations. He who is Bountiful or Merciful to us, hath by so being a Right to our Thankfulness and hearty Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to serve and please him. There is no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55682:9"/>
that more seems to be <hi>born</hi> with us than <hi>this,</hi> tho' we <hi>nevertheless</hi> need to be <hi>minded</hi> of it, or to have it imprest upon us; so Corrupt is Human Nature. And, next to a Sense of Pleasure and Pain, we discover none more early than a Sense of Gratitude: Nay, we discern in some <hi>Brutes</hi> that which is as like it, as an Egg to an Egg. And as <hi>Solomon</hi> sent the <hi>Sluggard</hi> to School to the poor <hi>Pismire,</hi> to learn Industry; so may the <hi>Dog</hi> of the Ungrateful man, teach him Gratitude.</p>
            <p>Now, if <hi>Love, Thankfulness,</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> are Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties necessarily resulting from the Relations of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Benefactors, and Deliverers, how much of those must needs be due to the infinitely best of such! His Right to them in the highest degree is so necessary, that He can no more <hi>quit</hi> or surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, than it can be <hi>taken</hi> from Him. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>Will</hi> to forgo this Right, any more than He can cease to be what He is, both in Himself, and in reference to His Creation. Contradictions are not Objects of <hi>Power,</hi> and therefore not of the <hi>Divine</hi> Power. And farther, setting aside the Divine <hi>Will</hi> in this Case, God cannot give us li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty <hi>not</hi> to Glorifie Him, because this would be to separate between things <hi>Essentially</hi> inseparable; which to suppose possible, is a monstrous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:55682:10"/>
2. The other Reason on which this Duty is founded; <hi>this,</hi> of <hi>Praising God with all our hearts, and Glorifying His Name for evermore,</hi> for our Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances, &amp;c. is, that thus to do is as good for <hi>us,</hi> and that <hi>necessarily,</hi> as it is just, fit, and good in <hi>itself.</hi> So that God must leave off to be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Happiness of his Creatures, according to their Natural Capacities of Happiness, (which so infinitely Good a Being cannot do) should He cease to Oblige us hereunto.</p>
            <p>Now the Sun at <hi>Noon</hi> is not more clearly visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than it is evident to all, whose Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are not blinded with vile Affections, that there is the most necessary Connexion between our Interest, and the Consciencious discharge of <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his Duty; even our Interest relating to both Worlds. And that we must be utterly unquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for the <hi>Heavenly</hi> Happiness, and as incapable of all true Self-enjoyment on <hi>this side</hi> Heaven, and shall have much more of the Brutish (nay, the <hi>worse</hi> than Brutish) than of the Human Nature, while the Blessings which are so heaped upon us, do not so affect us, as to engage us to live to the Praise of that Good-God, who has so highly Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at our Hands.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more plainly or easily demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than <hi>this,</hi> as nothing hath been oftener, or more
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55682:10"/>
Abundantly demonstrated. But <hi>good</hi> Men need not demonstrations of it; this is <hi>Self-evident</hi> to all such: Which may well excuse me from entring now upon so copious an Argument, tho' my time would permit me, as it will not.</p>
            <p>Now, to make Application of what hath been discours'd to the <hi>present Occasion,</hi> Is it possible we should any of us be difficultly perswaded, upon such a Deliverance as God has now again given us, to make <hi>these</hi> words of the Devout <hi>King</hi> our own, or to repeat them with that <hi>sense</hi> of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Goodness, which <hi>he</hi> expressed in them? <hi>I will praise Thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart, and I will glorifie Thy Name for evermore; for great is Thy Mercy towards me,</hi> and towards my King and Country, <hi>in that Thou hast delivered our Souls from going down into the Pit.</hi> Is it possible, I say, we should not readily and cheerfully <hi>thus</hi> do for such a Deliverance as <hi>this?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. And, in the <hi>first</hi> place, since so doing suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth an hearty Acknowledgment of <hi>God</hi>'s being the Author of it, can we think <hi>much</hi> of doing Him <hi>this</hi> Honour, which is the <hi>very least</hi> we can do Him for it?</p>
            <p>It may be censur'd as no <hi>good Manners</hi> to ask any of those <hi>this</hi> Question, who have now been joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Praises of God for this Deliverance; and I doubt it may be <hi>deservedly</hi> so censur'd, did we not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55682:11"/>
too well know, that nothing is more common than mere <hi>formal Addresses</hi> to Almighty God, and <hi>drawing near to Him with our Lips, when our Hearts are far from Him.</hi> With which great Hypocrisie, the <hi>Prophet,</hi> in His Name, charged even the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Country men, as devout Worshipers, as they would have been thought to be, of the God of <hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, I would to God that the incomparably greater number of <hi>our</hi> Country men, be not as chargeable herewith as the <hi>Israelites</hi> then were, althô the Religion <hi>we</hi> profess so much excels <hi>theirs!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to the great Sin of <hi>Infidelity,</hi> I wish it could be said, that it does much less prevail among <hi>us,</hi> (tho' we all call our selves <hi>Christians)</hi> than it did among the <hi>Jews,</hi> even in the <hi>Sadducean</hi> Age. But <hi>however,</hi> we must give a better demonstration of our sincerely professing our Obligation to <hi>God</hi> for this Great Deliverance, than our complyance with <hi>Authority</hi> in the observance of this day.</p>
            <p>In <hi>some</hi> Occurrences the Hand of God appeareth much more plainly than in <hi>others.</hi> We ought to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> it to be in <hi>all,</hi> but it is to be <hi>seen</hi> in <hi>some;</hi> so that those who discern it not, must shut their Eyes on purpose that they may not. And among <hi>these</hi> may <hi>this</hi> Deliverance be well reckon'd; as, I hope, 'twill appear anon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:55682:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But there have been in the World, such wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Blind and Perverse People, as would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God's Hand, no, not in the most incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable <hi>Miracles.</hi> Such were those of whom the <hi>Prophet</hi> complain'd, That <hi>they regarded not the Work of the Lord, neither considered the Operation of His Hand.</hi> And those of whom the <hi>Psalmist</hi> saith, That <hi>they understood not God's Wonders in</hi> Egypt. And, what strange Examples were those of this Perverseness, who had so many of the most Wonderful Miracles, wrought by our Saviour and His Apostles, before their Eyes, and <hi>yet believ'd not!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ordinarily the Divine Concurrence with the free Actings of Men, and with natural Agents, is not so discernible as that we are able to say, <hi>this</hi> is the Divine Part of the Event, and <hi>that</hi> the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, or merely Natural; tho' right Reason, as well as the Divine Oracles, will not so exclude God out of any Event, as to make Him a mere Spectator thereof, or a bare Permitter of any more in it, than what is <hi>morally</hi> Evil. For the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's being the Wise Governour, as well as Maker of the World, (which is evident from the Improvement of Natural Reason, as well as from Revelation; and therefore taught by the <hi>Pagan Philosophers,</hi> as well as by the <hi>Jewish</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Divines)</hi> will not admit of His being wholly
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55682:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Unconcern'd inany Occurrence whatsoever; since very great things may be occasion'd, and very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently have been, by as small and inconsiderable ones.</p>
            <p>I say, there are Occurrences, and such as (strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speaking) may not be called <hi>Miracles,</hi> which have such Circumstances belonging to them, that an Impartial Considerer of them, must necessarily see a Special Providence, and God's more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Hand in them. And these are so far from being <hi>Rarities,</hi> that all Ages and Countries have abounded with them. Nay, I question, whether there be any one <hi>single</hi> Person, who hath not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented several such relating to <hi>himself.</hi> But as to Publick and National Instances of this kind, how full are the Best Historians of them!</p>
            <p>To confine our selves to Deliverances of <hi>Kings and their People,</hi> out of great Calamities, or from imminent Dangers of falling into such: Who, for Example, can question whether there was an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Divine Hand, in the Raising of <hi>Cyrus</hi> for the Deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> from their Seventy. Years Captivity, tho'he were an utter Stranger to <hi>Isaiah</hi>'s Prophecy (in which he is foretold by <hi>Name</hi> as their Deliverer, above Two hundred years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was in being) if he hath read <hi>Tully</hi>'s Prince of Historians <hi>Herodotus,</hi> Or <hi>Xenophon,</hi> Or <hi>Justin?</hi> In
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55682:12"/>
whose Accounts of <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s Birth, and Preservation from being Butcher'd as soon as Born, by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of his Grandfather <hi>Astyages,</hi> and of the most wonderful Fortune that all-along attended him, from a poor Shepherd's Boy, to his Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a Mighty Empire, tho' I remember not one <hi>Miracle</hi> recorded in his Story, yet so long a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of Marvelous Events as we find therein, must needs have made the observers of them conclude him to be the immediate Care of Heaven, in order to the Accomplishment of some Glorious Design.</p>
            <p>There was no <hi>Miracle</hi> neither, in the <hi>Jews</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from the Cursed Design of proud <hi>Haman,</hi> but there was a concurrence of such Happy Events for the bringing it about, as spake it to be the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Work of God, as evidently every whit, as if it had been the Atchievement of <hi>many Miracles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But because I want time to enlarge upon <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of this nature, I'le content my self to mention but two or three more, which shall be Deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our own Kings, Church and People.</p>
            <p>There was nothing <hi>properly Miraculous</hi> in the Discovery of the Hellish <hi>Pouder Plot,</hi> but it being brought to light by such very Strange Means, (which I hope few of us are Ignorant of) and so very <hi>late,</hi> that had it been delay'd but some <hi>Hours</hi> longer, the Astonishing Blow would have given
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55682:13"/>
the first News of it, even Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi> was so affected with the Consideration of these things, as to acknowledge to the World that he looked on this Deliverance, as no less than <hi>Miraculous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Deliverance of King <hi>Charles</hi> II<hi rend="sup">d</hi> from his Twelve years Banishment, and of his <hi>Kingdoms</hi> from Arbitrary Government, Oppression, and Confusion, had no <hi>Miracle</hi> neither accompanying it, but so great a number of the most Surprizing things, all of a suddain follow'd upon the neck of each other, till they had made way for the King's Easie Return, even without the Effusion of a drop of Blood, through the most inconquerable difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that the Divine Power, Wisdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness were scarcely less eminently visible therein, than if no <hi>Human Means</hi> had contributed towards it.</p>
            <p>And what are we to think <hi>less</hi> of our Late Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery,</hi> and as scaring a Prospect as ever People had? Surely the most Egregious Folly of the <hi>Jesuites</hi> Counsels, as cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning shrewd Fellows as the World, to that time, had long accounted them: The strong Impressions which were upon the Minds of Great Men <hi>Abroad,</hi> even of both Religions, to Assist in Promoting this Deliverance: The Unanimous Agreement of so many of different Sentiments at <hi>Home,</hi> to the utmost to put to their helping Hand: The so close
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55682:13"/>
Concealment of so Hazardous a Design, which so many were Privy to: The Ordering of the <hi>Wind:</hi> The strange dispiriting of those who (humanely speaking) had <hi>Power,</hi> as well as <hi>Will,</hi> abundantly enough to defeat this Design: These, with many things more, are demonstrations that this Mighty Deliverance was no less the Work of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, than <hi>that</hi> of the <hi>Israelites</hi> at the <hi>Red Sea</hi> tho' it was not <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>strictly Miraculous,</hi> as that was.</p>
            <p>I may <hi>well</hi> add to this, the Deliverance of poor <hi>Ireland</hi> afterwards, out of the most deplorable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, it having been brought about by so many most Signal Events, as are enough to make a good Volume.</p>
            <p>After the self-same manner, that <hi>Tully</hi> ridicul'd the mad <hi>Epicuraean</hi> Hypothesis of the World's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing form'd by a lucky jumblement of Atoms, may our Infidels imputing <hi>such</hi> Deliverances to mere fortunate Chances, be expos'd to the Laughter of all, who are but a remove or two from <hi>Idiots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And we have great reason, to reckon the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance we are now Commemorating, among the 'foremention'd. The Hand of God so appears in <hi>this,</hi> that no Thanks are due for it, to either any Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Power or Policy. The happy Discovery of the <hi>horrible Design</hi> to Assassinate our Gracious
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55682:14"/>
Sovereign, and to back his Murther with a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Invasion, together with a mighty Assistance from the Combin'd Forces of <hi>Papists,</hi> and a strange sort of <hi>Protestants</hi> among ourselves; I say, the <hi>mere Discovery</hi> hereof was our Deliverance, like that of the <hi>Gunpowder Treason:</hi> Which (by the way) was in some respects the less dangerous of the two, <hi>viz.</hi> as none but <hi>Papists</hi> were engag'd in <hi>this,</hi> and there was no Division among <hi>Protestants</hi> at that time; and we had <hi>then</hi> nothing so formidable an Enemy to our Neighbour, as we have <hi>now.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Tragedy</hi> now to be Acted, there was late notice from Abroad of great <hi>French</hi> Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but no great Apprehension from them of a Design to <hi>invade</hi> us, till the Assassinating Part was brought to light. And the Circumstances of the discovery hereof are such, as speak it the <hi>Lord's do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> And indeed without the knowledge of those Circumstances (which may hereafter be more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly publish'd) whosoever believes a Providence su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintending the Affairs of the World, will think it highly reasonable to impute this Discovery to a Secret Impulse from <hi>Him,</hi> who hath the hearts of <hi>all Men in His Hand,</hi> (as the <hi>Wise Man</hi> saith of the hearts of <hi>Kings) and turneth them as the Rivers of Water.</hi> And to what can we ascribe so certainly <hi>the bringing to light such a hidden Work of darkness</hi> as
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55682:14"/>
               <hi>this</hi> was, and which was so very shrewdly laid, as to <hi>His</hi> Special Providence, <hi>from whom there is no dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, nor shadow of death,</hi> (to use <hi>Elibu</hi>'s words) <hi>where the Workers of Iniquity may hide themselves?</hi> Since no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more worthy of Infinite Goodness, than to take the <hi>most</hi> special Care of <hi>those,</hi> to whom is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Care of Whole Nations; and who are the Greatest Instruments of Good to Manking; as all good Kings are. And never did the Welfare of any People in the World more necessarily (under God) depend upon the Life of their King, than does <hi>Ours</hi> at this time (as our Enemies well know) upon the Preservation of <hi>his</hi> Life, who (not as our Conquerour, but for having been the Glorious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of our Deliverance) now Reigns over us. And who that is a hearty Assertor of the Divine Providence, can find in his heart to impute an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of so Mighty a consequence as <hi>this</hi> is, to God's bare <hi>Permission,</hi> since he knows that the most <hi>insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant</hi> and <hi>trivial</hi> matters can't come to pass with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it?</p>
            <p>And as to the <hi>Invasion,</hi> what a PROVIDENCE was it that the <hi>Wind</hi> should so constantly blow, for, I think, near a Quarter of a Year together, and in the <hi>Winter</hi> too, from such Points of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, as that the <hi>Squadron</hi> design'd for the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean,</hi> could not stir! Which if it had gone
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55682:15"/>
within <hi>that</hi> time, our Island had been left naked of all Defence. I am sure we concluded this stay of those Ships, a very <hi>Unhappy</hi> Providence, and that it boded extremely ill to us, whereas it prov'd to be the <hi>Happiest</hi> we could have wish'd for. Little did we imagine that now God had sent us another <hi>Protestant Wind.</hi> To nothing better than most Stupid Infidelity can the not seeing God's imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Hand in <hi>this,</hi> be attributed by us.</p>
            <p>But, God be thanked, no Body, would he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so fain, can now be so stupid or perverse, as to have the least <hi>doubt'</hi> of even the <hi>basest</hi> and <hi>most barbarous</hi> part of this Conspiracy; as many as at <hi>first</hi> would have had it a <hi>Sham;</hi> it being confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, under their hands, by two of those three <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> who have Suffer'd for it, and not denied by the third; tho' they could not have Wanted Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, had they Protested most solemnly in their Old Form, That <hi>they knew no more of it than the Child unborn.</hi> But all they Attempted was, the Clearing their <hi>King</hi> from having any hand in it. And how did they this? They only affirm'd, that they saw not, nor knew of any <hi>Commission</hi> from him for it. And this they might truly affirm in the strict sence of the word <hi>[Know]</hi> if they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>seen</hi> it, tho' it had been never so well <hi>Attested</hi> to them. But those little understand what a <hi>Papist</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:55682:15"/>
is, who can think the Conscience of any of them so <hi>strait laced,</hi> as to scruple so small an Equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as <hi>this,</hi> to serve so highly meritorious a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, as the wiping off such a horrible Scandal from a King so Bigotted to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to part with three Kingdoms for her sake. But 'tis a <hi>Jest</hi> which no Sensible Man can forbear smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at, that there should be a Commission for an Invasion, but <hi>none</hi> for that on which their Hopes of Success did so much depend.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the <hi>second</hi> place, since the Hand of God is so Apparent in this Deliverance, let us not only Acknowledg it, which (as hath been said) is the least Honour we can do Him for it, but let us <hi>most Gratefully</hi> Acknowledg it. And let us express our Gratitude, by <hi>Praising</hi> our Great and most Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Deliverer <hi>with all our hearts,</hi> and <hi>Glorisying His Name for evermore,</hi> in the full sence which hath been given of these Phrases. Let us express it by crying out, with the same holy Man, <hi>O Magnifie the Lord with me, and let us Exalt His Name toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> By adapting the Doxology of the Mother of our Lord hereto, <hi>My Soul doth Magnifie the Lord, and my Spirit doth Rejoyce in God my Saviour:</hi> And, above all, by more fearing to offend Him, and more delighting to please Him, for the time to come; this being the great End and Design of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55682:16"/>
Deliverances <hi>particularly,</hi> as hath been shew'd: And God Almighty having told us the same thing, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 15. <hi>I will deliver thee, and thou shalt Glorifie Me.</hi> And I need not repeat it, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of our Lives is absolutely necessary to our Glorifying of God. Certainly, a very little Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity will constrein us to <hi>these</hi> Expressions of Thankfulness, if we well consider,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> What our Deliverance is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> What little <hi>Reason,</hi> we had <hi>now,</hi> of <hi>any</hi> time, to expect such a Deliverance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we well consider, what our Deliverance is, and therefore seriously Reflect upon what we are deliver'd from, we shall be presently satisfied, that no People under Heaven ever had a Greater. Had our Enemies Accomplish'd their Horrid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, upon the Royal Person of our Sovereign, How would <hi>our Faces have gathered Blackness!</hi> With what <hi>Fearfulness and Trembling</hi> should we have been seiz'd, upon the dreadful Out-cry, <hi>The King is Murther'd! The King is Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd!</hi> And how would <hi>our Hearts have failed us for fear, and for looking after the things that were coming upon us!</hi> And what Horrour and Astonishment would have filled all Places, upon the Rushing in of so many <hi>Thousands</hi> of Bloody <hi>French,</hi> joyn'd with an Army of Unnatural <hi>English!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:55682:16"/>
Then would our Streets have Rung with as doleful Moan, as that of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> upon the <hi>Babylonians</hi> invading <hi>his</hi> Country: <hi>My Bowels! My Bowels! I am pained at the very heart; my heart maketh a noise in me, I cannot hold my peace; because thou hast heard, O my Soul, the Sound of the Trumpet, the Alarm of War; Destruction upon Destruction is Cryed.</hi> And like that of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> in the name of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> upon the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Invasion; <hi>Look away from me, I will weep bitterly, because of the Spoiling of the Daughter of my People: For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity by the Lord of Hosts.</hi> And what frightful Spectacles should we have been forced to behold, while <hi>our selves</hi> were not among those Spectacles! Such as <hi>dead Bodies covering our Streets, and Blood running down the Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels: Our Houses all on a Flame: The Ravishing of Wives and Daughters;</hi> and All manner of Salvage Outrages.</p>
            <p>And should an entire <hi>Conquest</hi> at last have been made of us; which, considering all our Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances (not now to be mention'd) would, in the Eye of Reason, have been inevitable, without God Almighty's Wonderful Interposing, and been but a short Work too, our Religion, Liberty, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, every thing valuable and worth the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, would <hi>for ever</hi> have taken leave of the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivers
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55682:17"/>
of those Calamities; and of how many <hi>succeeding</hi> Generations also, God only knows. For who needs be told, that Tyranny and Cruelty are inseparable from Popery, wheresoever it has its full Swing, and is under no Restreint; and nothing in <hi>Nature</hi> is more Evident, than that <hi>now</hi> it would be so. For, at least, our <hi>Protestant Allys</hi> must undoubtedly in a little time, have drank as deep as our selves, of the same Bitter Cup.</p>
            <p>And now, to <hi>digress</hi> a while, could our Restless <hi>Protestant</hi> Country-men, who have long'd for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than the Downfal of this Government (as Easie as they might, if they would, live under it) could they have <hi>hoped</hi> that this Bitterest of Cups should have past from <hi>them?</hi> We know they more than <hi>hoped</hi> it, they <hi>presumed</hi> it would, or they could never have adventur'd to Engage with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Foreigners, and the most deadly Enemies in the World to <hi>England,</hi> in such a Conspiracy. But never was Faith built upon such foolish Evidence. For, if we can be certain of any Futurity, we may be of <hi>this,</hi> that, had their Design prosper'd, they would have been so far from not being involv'd in the sad Circumstances of the Friends of this Government, that they must have been the <hi>most</hi> Wretched People among us. And therefore, if any have more cause than others, to Praise God
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55682:17"/>
for this Deliverance, these have <hi>most</hi> of any; All of them that shall be so Fortunate, as to Escape the Hand of Justice.</p>
            <p>For, how Miserable must <hi>those</hi> be, who have not Abandon'd all Concern for their Native Country (which, I should think, none of them can, should they never so much endeavour it) when, upon observing the Miseries they have brought upon it, they would be forced to take up that Cry of Fools, <hi>Non Putâram, I could never have thought it;</hi> and when they should have no better Cordial for the allaying of their Grief, than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their Families faring no better than their Neighbours.</p>
            <p>And that they could not, is every whit as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, as that <hi>Protestants</hi> Merits can have no other Influence upon <hi>Papists,</hi> than to raise Laughter, whensoever they are wholly at the mercy of their Ingenuity: And as certain too, as that nothing but <hi>Interest</hi> can oblige Papists, <hi>to keep faith with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</hi> And these mens <hi>Greatest</hi> Master may satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them, that against what he shall please to call his Interest, he cannot be oblig'd (no, not by the most Solemn Oaths at the Holy Altar) not to break faith with his Brother <hi>Catholicks.</hi> The <hi>Most Catholick</hi> King well knows to his Cost, what hold such Cords as those can have, of his <hi>Most Christian</hi> Majesty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:55682:18"/>
But as to these Gentlemens Great Merits, on which they have built such mighty Confidence, how sanguine are they in taking it for granted, that their <hi>After-game</hi> would be better Remembred than their having had no Concern for their King, when they might, possibly, have kept him upon his Throne! Nay, that it would be better Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred than their having been so very Angry with him, for his <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Proceedings; or rather (to speak plain truth) for his not employing <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> in advancing Prerogative above Law; and for his having so forgot their <hi>former</hi> Merits, as to kick them off, to receive the Fanaticks in their room. And, once more, how came they by their Confidence, that this their <hi>After-game</hi> must needs be better Remembred, than their Rejoycing as much as others at the Prince's Landing; and than their being so willing to have K. <hi>James</hi> shackled, and made a kind of <hi>Doge of Venice?</hi> Not to go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Demerits of some of the Chiefest of them, as they know I might.</p>
            <p>I wish these People could have look'd on their Dark, as well as on their Bright side, and then have thought with themselves what Darlings they are like to be, when a View shall be taken of both together, or rather of their Dark side only. And all but themselves must needs call to mind
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55682:18"/>
enough to conclude, that their <hi>Ill</hi> deservings will be best Remembred, when there's no farther oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion for their Service; as there would have been none in a little time.</p>
            <p>What I have said, is upon a charitable Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that, for the completing of their Merits, they would not (at least Generally) be prevail'd with to Renounce their Religion; but 'tis easie to think that whosoever should <hi>thus late</hi> be perswaded to it, his Motives thereto would be so well understood, as that 'twould stand him in but little stead. Not to mention how <hi>dear</hi> he must expect to pay for his <hi>Apostasy</hi> in the <hi>Other</hi> World.</p>
            <p>But <hi>indeed,</hi> half an Eye may see, that under a <hi>French</hi> Conquest, 'twill be Crime enough to be an <hi>English</hi> Man; and that should K. <hi>James</hi> be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so willing to shew favour to his Subjects, he would have <hi>none</hi> to shew favour to. That, at <hi>best,</hi> the Power of a <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> must then Content him. Who can question <hi>this,</hi> that hath not forgot, how very short his Power was of a <hi>Vice-Roys</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that <hi>Lauzune</hi> made all the Figure <hi>there?</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And <hi>now</hi> let these Gentlemen take it for a great <hi>Civility,</hi> to be address'd to in no harder words than those of K. <hi>Solomon, How long, ye Simple ones, will you love Simplicity?</hi> Or of his <hi>Royal Father's, Ye Fools, when will ye be Wise?</hi> When will you be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55682:19"/>
made sensible, how destructive to all Humane Society, the Principles are, on which you have founded your Flaming Loyalty? When will you be Convinc'd of the Pernicious Folly of such an Extravagant Notion of Passive Obedience, as levels a Legal with the most Arbitrary Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as makes Laws not worth a Straw, one jot longer than the Prince pleases; as hath not the least shadow of Truth, except instead of Kings being made for People, People are made to be <hi>wholly</hi> subjected to the Lusts of Kings; to Abuse them, Harass and Plague them, and do what they <hi>list</hi> with them? Which to suppose, would speak God Almighty <hi>such</hi> a Being, as that 'twould be even a less horrid Blasphemy, boldly to affirm He hath <hi>no</hi> Being.</p>
            <p>I am sure, much more than enough hath been written since this Happy Revolution, to make these Friends of ours sensible, not only how False their Principles of Government are, but also how fatally Mischievous and Destructive. I pray God their Eyes may at <hi>length</hi> be open'd; and I should think that <hi>now</hi> is the time for it, if <hi>ever</hi> they be.</p>
            <p>The less Innocent of them do well deserve to have those words of the <hi>Prophet</hi> apply'd to them, <hi>Let favour be shewed to the Wicked, yet will be not learn Righteousness; and will not behold the Majesty</hi>

               <hi>of the Lord. Lord, when Thine Hand is lifted up, they will not see, but they shall see and be Ashamed,</hi> &amp;c. Or <hi>they shall see</hi> when 'tis too late for seeing to do them Service. But I chuse rather to give them the necessary Advice of Our <hi>Blessed Saviour, Sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto you.</hi> And let them thank God with all their Hearts, that he hath done infinitely better now for <hi>them,</hi> than what they had done for <hi>themselves,</hi> if He had not defeated their most Desperate Design.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In order to our being the more Affected with the Greatness of our Deliverance, let us not only reflect upon what Miseries we are deliver'd from, but likewise consider what little Reason we had <hi>now</hi> (we had now of <hi>any</hi> time) to expect from Him such a Deliverance. Had we, I beseech you, made such Returns for our late so wonderful a one, as reasonably to hope for such another, should we again need it? Alas, alas! never was our Good God worse Requited for <hi>any</hi> Delivearance, than He hath been for <hi>that.</hi> So that we had all the reason in the World to fear, that (as He threatned the <hi>Israelites, Judg.</hi> x. 13.) <hi>He would deliver us no more;</hi> and yet we are not <hi>only</hi> again rescu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a worse than <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage, but also deliver'd from being so much as <hi>Scared</hi> with the Imminent Danger we were in again of falling
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55682:20"/>
under it. What shall we say to this? What other Account can be given of it, but that of the Son of <hi>Sirach, As is God's Majesty, so is His Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I say, our former Deliverance, as Amazing as it was, was (to our Infinite Shame) very soon forgotten; and that notwithstanding many very strange and most surprizing Providences, in order to the more completing thereof. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the severe Scourges we have since met with, for our horrible Ingratitude, we have still persisted therein, as if we had a mind to provoke God Almighty, to become no less our Enemy, than He had been our Friend. But if an Affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sense of the Dreadful things we have been deliver'd from, be not <hi>now</hi> reviv'd; and (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we apparently grew a Worse People, after that Deliverance, having begun to be a Better, while the Rod was upon <hi>some</hi> of us, and hung over us <hi>all)</hi> if there be <hi>now</hi> no Visible Reformation; if Debauchery and Prosaneness shall abound among the Friends of this Government as much as <hi>ever;</hi> if those who have been Infidels in their Principles, or such in Practice (living without God in the World, and disacknowledging Him in their Ways) shall be generally so <hi>still;</hi> if Pride and Vanity, a dear Love of the World, Factiousness, and base Selfishness, or the preference of our Personal or
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55682:20"/>
Private Interests, before the Interest of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick (of the Church and State) shall reign as much as <hi>ever;</hi> if Religion shall hold on at so very low an ebb, as it is <hi>now</hi> at (ay, and the Old <hi>English Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty</hi> too, God knows); if Divisions and Animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Emulation and Strife do not <hi>now</hi> abate; if we continue so Unconcern'd for each others Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, while our God so concerns Himself for <hi>all</hi> our Welfares; if neither the Wrath of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, nor our repeated Deliverances from their Wrath, can Reconcile us to God, nor to one-ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And, lastly, whereas we have at length obtain'd an Excellent Law, against profane Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and Cursing, (which, I fear, begins already to signifie much less than it did at first) if there be not henceforth an Hearty Zeal for a more tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Reformation; I say, if this Great Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance shall do no more than past Deliverances, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the making us a more Honest, a more Sober, a better Natur'd, and a more Religious People; and I think fit to add too, if a Sober and Discreet <hi>Use</hi> be not made of it; as much as good Men Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in it, they will <hi>rejoyce with trembling</hi> to think, <hi>what</hi> things may <hi>yet</hi> be reserv'd for our Church and Nation, after <hi>all</hi> the Extraordinary and next to Miraculous Appearances of God for <hi>both.</hi>
