            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ur Lorde and Sauioure Iesus Christ, when he hadde confirmed the mindes of his Disciples, agaynste the daungers of persecution, whych they shoulde be in daunger of, for the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the truth of his doctrine, with a spirite thurstyng our saluation, brake foorth into these woordes: What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth it a man (sayd he) though he win al the world, if he lose hys own soule: <note place="margin">Math. 16.</note> Or what recompence shal a man geue for his soule: And his meaning was to admonish not onely his Disciples, but also al vs together with them, how much the saluation of soules is to be made of, which being deliuered from the bodye, and once abiected from God, can by no price or recompence he redemed agayne.</p>
            <p>But then are they most of al endaungered, when they straye from the true knowledge of God, and his syncere woorshipping. For God is lyfe and truth, and therefore the death of the soule is, to decline fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rule of the wyl of God, reuealed in Christ. But bicause the Lorde speaketh not vnto vs from heauen, but hath vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth instituted the ministery of teaching, whereby men are instructed of the wil of God, we see that for that cause (I say) men are diuerslye affected. For they which teach in the churche of God doo not euerye where professe one and the selfe same doctrine.</p>
            <p>And when Christ sayde of true teachers: He that heareth you, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <note place="margin">Luke. 10. Math. 18.</note> me. And agayne: If he shal not heare the church let hym bee vnto thee as an Ethnicke and a Publicane, they excedinglye doubt, vnto what congregation, in so great a diuersitye of opinions they ought to soyne them selues.</p>
            <p>For on the one syde, they are holden by ordinary succession (as they ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> it) and custome and consent of very long tyme, in whose congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion yet neuerthelesse they see very many errours, and no small abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which they them selues vnderstand, and iudge that they ought of necessity to be amended. On the other side against humane traditions they heare the expresse woorde of God brought foorth and vrged, but for asmuch as they fynde among those me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also occasion to be offended, and chiefely bicause they thinke that the chaunging of doctrine and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies pertaineth not vnto euery man, but vnto the ordinarye po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, they can scarse tel which way to turne them selues.</p>
            <p>They flye therefore vnto the authority of a Counsel, as to an one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sanctuary, whereby they iudge that dissension sprong in the Church may most commodiously be taken awaye. Of which thyng when deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration was had long tyme and often by the orders of the Empyre,
<pb facs="tcp:19130:3"/>
neither yet by any conditions whereby on eyther syde it was requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it could be obtained, the saluation of many men, hath by the stay of so long tyme bene miserably endaungered.</p>
            <p>And although such are iustly to be reproued, whych neglecting the very sounding from heauen of the sonne of God: Heare him, haue a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde vnto the authority of men: for the consideration of our saluation is not so obscurelye taught, but that euen the moste simplest in fayth may comprehende it, yet I thinke not that this kinde of men is to bee abiected. But rather in that part wherin we see that they ar sicke, we must after the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of the Apostels, to our power study to heale the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <note place="margin">Actes. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>For that happeneth in this our time, which we reade happened at Ierusalem on the day of Pentecost, after the ascention of Christe into heauen: For when the people saw and heard the Apostels with sundry tounges celebrate the wonderful things of God, whom yet the Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes, Scrib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s, and Phariseis had a litle before condemned and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, they were vtterly at their wyts ende and in doubte whose doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine they should embrace. For Christ seemed no lesse to commend the doctrine of the Phariseis, than the doctrine of the Apostels. when he said: Upon the chaire of Moses syt the Scribes and Phariseis, that <note place="margin">Math. 2.</note> which they say, doo ye. What maruaile is it if the rude and vnlearned people were doubtfull? For the Phariseis vnto whom they were so long tyme addicted in learning the woorshippyng of God, taught one thing, and the Apostels an other thing. The selfe same thing vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedlye wee see happeneth in this our age. For with our Elders great hath bene the authority of the Church of Rome, wherewith the eyes of many men are yet styl blinded. But no lesse. yea rather farre greater is the authority of the woord of God, whereby are reproued errours and abuses, which haue throughe the negligence and auarice of men crept into the Church. A man that wyl ryd him selfe our of these diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, ought not vtterly to be vnskilful in holy matters, and so to be addicted vnto the Church, that in the meane tyme he same not against the manifest wil of God, expressed in the woord of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>But there are two rockes, betwene which godlye men must wyth great care and diligence sayle. For some by reason of lightnes of mind, without iudgement and true faith embrace euery maner of religion. But other some to stubbornlye resist, and wyll not once so muche as vauchsafe to know the doctrine set foorth, bicause their minde is bent vnto an opinion, which they defend for the truth. Or bring ouercome with the pleasures of this worlde, they haue no care of the truth, nor saluation of their soules.</p>
            <p>But there is none amongest them that are trulye godlye, so rude to thinke that so great inconstancye of minde in the doctrine of religion, or stubbornes in errors should be numbred among vertues, but by the holy scriptures they are taught that either of them is to be auoyded. For against inconstancy the Apostle speaketh: Let vs not be as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ytile <note place="margin">Ephesi. 4. Iohn. 4.</note> ones wauering, neither let vs be caried about with euerye wynde of
<pb facs="tcp:19130:3"/>
doctrine. But against stubbornes in errour Iohn hath left in writing: Proue the spirites, whether they be of God. Wherwith the selfe same Apostle agreeth: Quench not (saith he) the spirite, despise not prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. <note place="margin">1. Thes. 4,</note> But proue ye al thing, that which is good, hold.</p>
            <p>But bicause it is a singular gift of God, to proue spirites, and as the Apostle saith prophecye, that is, the naturall interpretation of the holy scripture belongeth not to euery man. Manye suppose that thys care pertaineth onely to Bishops and Priestes, that a Synode being assembled, learned and modest men on eyther partye, and suche as are addicted to nothing but vnto the truthe and healthe of the Churche, should temperately conferre together of articles in controuersye. For they thinke them selues farre inferiours, than that they shoulde take vpon them to iudge of so great matters, where disputacion is had of the saluation of soules.</p>
            <p>Although these men which thus iudge touching matters of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be in some part woorthye of pardon, or rather compassion, yet me thinketh they are gentlye and modestlye to be admonished of certayne thynges.</p>
            <p>For first in that they iudge that it is profitable and necessarye, that godly and learned prophetes (for so the Apostle calleth the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of holy scripture, and Bishops) shoulde assemble together in a Synode and conferre their sentences together concerning the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles proposed, in this part they seme not to erre. For we rede that not onely the successours of the Apostels did so, but also the Apostles them selues, as the Actes of the Apostels and Counsels doo testify.</p>
            <p>So straight waye after the ascension of Christe into heauen, when at Antioche there arose a question as touching the obseruation of the <note place="margin">Actes. 15<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

               </note> law of Moises, as a thing necessary to the rightcousnes of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is auayleable before God: Paule and Barnabas by the consent of the Church of Antioche went vp to Ierusalem to the Apostels and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that it might be manifestiye knowen vnto the Churches, that they in al pointes agreed with the rest of the Apostels, against the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned lye of the false Apostels. For the false Apostles had euerye where abroade in the Churches accused Paule and Barnabas of this thing, namely, that they vnder the name of the Gospell deliuered an other, and farre diuers doctrine vnto the Gentiles.</p>
            <p>Lykewise also in the primitiue Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there wer by the authority of godly Emperours assembled the Counsels of Nice, Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Ephesus, and Chalcedonia, against Arrius, Macedonius, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storius, and Eutiches, to retayne styll a godlye consent in doctrine of the deuinity of Christ, Of his two natures deuine and humane in one person, Of the person and deuinity of the holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>So also after that, for the taking away of dissentions betwene the <note place="margin">In the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of Basill S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For that thyng is accustomed to happen in the Church, which happeneth in houses, which vnles they be with bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms often made cleane, they wil be couered with filthynes and dust: So also vnles the Teachers of the Church doo with a perpetual care and diligence geue vigilant heede, and continuallye institute godlye conferringes together of sentences, easy is the fal of doctrine and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, &amp; except they be in tyme corrected, they are accustomed to draw a wonderful great ruine vnto the Church.</p>
            <p>But in this thing they seeme not to indge wel, in that they think that the peace and tranquility of the Churche may by this meanes be recouered and preserued firme. For although the disputacions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of godly Counsels haue brought great vnity vnto the Churche of God, in which the peruerse and vngodly opinions of heretiks haue bene by testimonies of the holye scripture vehement<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ye reproued, yet the Ecclestastical history testifieth that no lesse contentions, yea also sometimes greater contentions haue happened in the Church of God after the Counsels had bene celebrated. Upon which occasion Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Nazianzenus being moued with the euent of the Counsels wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that from that tyme forward he determined, to eschewe all Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodes of Bishops, bicause he found that no Synode had a good ende: or which rather brought not increases of euyls, than an ende of them. Although that this good man in this point seemed somewhat to erre, for that he there for that cause iudged that Synodes are vtterly to be auoyded, bicause he sawe that the peace of the Churche coulde not by Counsels be made firme.</p>
            <p>For although it were to be wished, that al men should rest in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the truth, which is in godly Synodes instituted by testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the vndoubted holy scripture, yet this is not the sole &amp; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ende of Counsels. For there alwaies haue bene, are and shalbe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious wits, which endeuour them selues to perturbe the peace and concorde of the Churche. But the principal end of Counsels is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and confirmation of sounde doctrine, and the confutation of errours and peruers opinions. Whych althoughe it satisfieth not all men, yet it satisfieth al the godlye, whose simplicitye is correspondent vnto a godly explication of the truth.</p>
            <p>Therefore, whether the peace of the Churche bee restored, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it bee not restored, yet a godlye conferring of sentences in godlye Synodes is both profitable and necessary. And vnlesse suche a confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring were had, it were to be feared, least the multitude and variety of opinions should at the length bring no lesse cuyll and discommoditye vnto the Church of God, than brought the superstition of tyme past.</p>
            <p>And bicause some daunger commeth of disputations that are to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement, godly princes may by their authority easely remedye this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyl, who of necessity must be present at them: as we reade was done in the Counsell of Chalsidonia, that by their authoritye contentions and wanton wyttes were restrayned wythin the bondes of Christian
<pb facs="tcp:19130:4"/>
modesty. For euen as it is trulye sayde: that by to muche alteration the truth is lost, so also semeth it no lesse to be truly said: that by quiet disputing, &amp; godly conferring of sentences, the truth is brought forth, whereunto the sonne of God hath promised that he wyl be present to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the father and the holy Ghost, yea if there be but twoo or three gathered together in his name. And it is better presently to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate of matters with a modest conferring together being appointed, than by mutual writing to inflame the hartes of either party.</p>
            <p>Farther, in this thyng also they iudge not ryghtlye, for that they thinke, that in suche Counsels are matters entreated of, which vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wholy passe the capacity of the laity.</p>
            <p>For although al the Laity neither can, neither are bound exactly to know the reasons and argumentes of al and singular controuersies, yet no godly Counsell hath decreed of anye thing, which of necessitye pertaineth vnto the saluation of al and singular men, which also such as are but euen meanely instructed in the chiefe pointes of their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian faith vnderstand not wel, and as much as to them is sufficient is playne ynough.</p>
            <p>The ten commaundementes are knowen, the articles of fayth are knowen the forme of the Lordes praier is knowen, the maner of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme and institution of the Lordes supper are knowen, the ministerye also of remitting and retaining synnes in the name of Christe is kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen. In which principal pointes are contayned, almoste all maner of controuersies that the world hath in religion.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the Laity ought so to stand and leane vnto the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Counsels that in the tyme they knowe that it is no lesse subiect vnto the woord of the Lorde, than are men which bee moste simple in Christian faith. And by this meanes there should be no new thing or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in Counsels, or which is repugnant vnto Christian faith, but forasmuch as it is a very easye thing to fall from Christian fayth into sundry and pernitious errours, it is nedeful that these errours should in godly Synodes by men of vnderstanding bee knowen and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, least the faith of the simple should decay, which ar not able to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande and to attayne vnto scholastical and synodical disputations, if men would there vse them.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the ruder sort of the Laity depend not vpon the decrees of Counsels, to beleue this thing or that thing, but vpon the symple and playne doctrine, which is most briefely contained in the principall pointes of the Cathechis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e. Unto which also the Counsels giue help, least they should be troubled with the subtill reasoning of ambitious men, which being neglected, they content them selues with the moste plaine &amp; most simple doctrine of the Cathechis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e, according to which they may for their simplicity iudge of al doctrines as muche as is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for them.</p>
            <p>But this woorthily much greueth godly men, that when there is mencion wade <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>f Papisticall Synodes, the true iudge cannot execute
<pb facs="tcp:19130:5"/>
his office. For in the last former communication celebrated at Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes in the yeare. 1557, they whiche were appointed collocutors on the Bishop of Romes side, by apert and manyfest woordes affirmed that the holy scripture is not the voice of the Iudge, by whom one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sentence should be geuen in knowing and iudging of controuersies of religion, but that it is matter of strife. Which their sentence if they should still stand vnto, then shoulde godlye Teachers come wyth no fruite to institute a conferring with them, for they haue no other rule to know the truth besydes the holy scripture. For this is a perpetual rule. Whatsoeuer is found to be repugnaunt vnto the scripture of the prophetes and of the Apostels, of what authority so euer it be, it must be reiected. But they which can not abide this sole and onely Iudge, it is manifest that these haue a mystrust in their cause: Unto which the holye fathers haue made all their writinges subiect: which in all partes agreeth with it selfe, when as the fathers often tymes, are not onely repugnaunt one to an other, but also vnto themselues, whyche thing besydes other thinges Augustines bookes of retractations doo testifye.</p>
            <p>But the doctrine of the Prophetes &amp; of the Apostels is an vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted testimony of the wyl of God, and a most certaine rule of the truth, and the very expresse voyce of the Iudge. If we (sayth the Apostle) or an Angel from heauen preache anye other Gospell vnto you, than that which wee haue preached vnto you, let him bee accursed. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: <note place="margin">Gala. 1.</note> If any man come vnto you and bring not this doctrine, receaue him not into your house, neither say ye so muche as God speede vnto <note place="margin">2. Iohn. 1. Math. 7. Luke. 3.</note> him. And the father from heauen speaketh: This is my welbeloued Sonne in whom I am well pleased, him heare ye. Wherefore there can be no other Iudge in controuersies of religion, than the woorde of God deliuered in the scripture of the Prophetes and of the Apostles, vnto which al Canons, al constitutions, al the writinges of al the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ought to be subiect and bounde vnto this voyce of the Iudge, whereby they shoulde be eyther approued or reiected. In this matter let nothing bee attributed vnto the arbitrement of a priuate man: let there be a godly and modest conferring together of sentences institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, of the matter of strife, which are the sundry opinions of men, and not the holy scripture, which in al partes agreeth with it selfe, beynge spoken by the spirite of truth. If it onelye myght beare rule in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, controuersies would easely be quieted.</p>
            <p>Wherefore forasmuch as euen from the beginning of the spreadyng abroade of the Gospel through out the whole world Synodes of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and godly men haue bene iudged of al the godly not onely health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but also necessary: Of which Synodes this ought to be the onelye purposed scope and ende, namely that the doctrine of the Church may be purged to the prayse of almighty God, and offences taken awaye, and discipline woorthy for the Gospel restored and preserued in al or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. The bishop of Rome Pius the fourth hath agayne called a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
<pb facs="tcp:19130:5"/>
of Cardinals, bishops, &amp; Monkes at Trent: wherin he with great glory &amp; magnificence, promiseth both the purging of doctrine from al errours and heresies, and also a sooner amendement of maners, and woorthy for the Gospel as well in the Clergye as in the people. And to the end the vnlearned should not deubt of the diligence of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Counsell, they are not afeard not onelye to accuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues of dissolute lyfe, but also to make them selues gyltye before the whole world as the fountaine and authors of al euyls: as the actes of this Counsel shal declare in their place.</p>
            <p>And who would not be glad to helpe such a one which promiseth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgation of the doctrine of the Church and maners with such care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes and endeuour, chiefelye in suche a dissipation of Churches? Who would not to his power helpe so godlye and holye an enterprise? But if wee examine the Canons and decrees, whiche not long since came foorth from this Counsell, euery Christian man shal easely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, that these good holy Fathers entende nothing lesse: yea rather all their labour and endeuour is onelye to thys purpose, to oppresse sound doctrine, and that being oppressed, stubbornly to defende idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, superstition &amp; abuses which are brought into the Church of God.</p>
            <p>When I vnderstoode these thinges, of such things which are eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye where caryed about in many mens handes, and there wythal saw very many to hang in doubt and suspense by expectation of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel and authority thereof, and earnestly to hope for a symple, godly and plaine determination of controuersies of religion, of whyche number yet in the meane time (whilest they haue bene decreeing of al the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies) manye haue not without great daunger of their soules de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of this lyfe: I thought I should doo a woorthy act, if brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and perspicuously I should declare by the woord of the Lord, what is to be iudged of their disputations, decrees and Canons, and what is to be hoped for of the euent of this Counsel.

            <p>The thynges that came to my hand being sent from Trent, are not

            <p>For as muche as the Synode of Trent denieth that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cupiscence is in very dede sinne, notwithstanding, neither <note place="margin">Sess. v.

Rom. vii.</note> Thou shall not lust, And the law prohibiteth nothing but sinnes, If therfore lust be not in very dede of the number of sinnes, it can not be prohibited, &amp; the commaundement of the Lord twice with so great seueritye repeated is in vayne. Agayne I saye that these good holy fathers wyll thinke that there is nothyng not lawfull vnto them, if
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19130:10"/>
the faithfull shoulde graunt vnto them so manifest an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and sacriledge.</p>
            <p>Lykewyse also that opinion is repugnaunt to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne <note place="margin">Sess. vi.</note> of Christ and of the Apostles, which they go aboute by the thunder of cursyng to establishe, theyr false (I saye) and vngodlye opinion concernyng humane strength and freewill: namely that freewill is not extinguished though it be appayred and diminished. When we were dead vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to synnes (sayeth the Apostle) he hath quickened vs toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Ephes. ii.</note> with Christ: looke howe much a dead man is able to accomplyshe to recouer corporall lyfe, so much doth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle attribute to mans strengthe in hys conuersion to God. And Christ sayth: Without me ye can doe nothyng. And to the Corinthians the Apostle writeth: we are not <note place="margin">Iohn, xv. ii. Cor. iii.</note> able to thinke any thyng of our selues, as of oure selues. Agaynste these moste manifest testimonyes, bycause they would attribute somewhat to mans strength, they are not ashamed to diminyshe the grace of God, whiche both chaungeth and moueth the will of the electes to obey the Gospell.</p>
            <p>To the same end also tendeth the. vii. Canon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same Session, where in the workes done without fayth, iustifie from sinne, contrary to the manifeste sentence of Paule <note place="margin">Rom. xiiii.</note> whiche sayeth: Whatsoeuer is not of fayth is synne, and those which with the Apostle thinke otherwyse they strike with theyr curse.</p>
            <p>In the. xii. Canon they vtterly ouerthrowe the hed and foundation of the doctrine of the Gospell, and they robbe afflicted consciences of the only comfort whiche they haue in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloud of Christ.

            <p>No lesse impiety hath the 13. Canon wherein we are taught by reason of our infirmitie &amp; vnaptnes, continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to doubt of the remission of sinnes before God.</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenantes

are performed, so God in Baptisme as it were takyng vs by the right hand, confirmeth, that he will be a mercifull God vnto vs in Christ, that he wil forgeue our sinnes, and receaue vs into grace. For this cause also the <note place="margin">Rom. viii</note> Apostle sayth: ye haue not receaued the spirite of bondage agayne in feare, but ye haue receaued the spirite of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption of the sonnes of God, by whom we crye <hi>Abba</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For that spirite beareth witnesse to our spirite that we are the children of God. Also: Ye are scaled with the holy spirite of promise, whiche is the pledge of our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritaunce. <note place="margin">Ephe. i</note>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore it is both extreme impietie, and also igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of holye Scriptures, to bryng men into a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall doubte bycause of their infirmitie, wherewith also the nature of the sainctes is infected. Whiche thyng this present Canon doth, wherein all the doctrine of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes and of the Apostles is condemned.</p>
            <p>And euen by this onely article, though all the other were conuenient, the godly reder may iudge, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes and we striue not (as the sayeng is) aboute moone shine in the water, but about a thing most wayghty. For the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation of our saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the most proper ende &amp; scope of the Gospell is, to teache, that men, beyng penitent and beleuing from the hart, hauyng no regard to their sinnes or to their owne infirmitie and vnaptnesse, shoulde assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly appoint and without all doubtyng firmely beleue, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> for Christes sake they haue remission of al their sinnes, that they are in the fauor of God, and haue eternall lyfe. This foundation of our saluation, and this onely conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of afflicted consciences the fathers of the Counsell ouerthrowe by this their decree of perpetuall doubtyng. where vnto all y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Idolatry and superstition of the Papacy leaneth. For take away doubtyng, and Purgatory is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken awaye, Peregrinations or Pilgrimages to the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Saintes, the opinion of Merites, of Fastynges,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19130:13"/>
and prayers, the sacrifice of the Masse for the quicke and the dead, inuocation of sainctes &amp; such like, al these things (I say) if you take away doubting, are taken awaye. But contraryly to affirme &amp; defend doubting, is to take away faith, &amp; to abrogate the promises of the Gospel, and vtter ly to blot it out of the hartes of men.</p>
            <p>The like pernitious error is stablished in the 18. Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. That a man being iustified, and set in grace, may perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fulfil the law of God. For although the regenerate do receaue the holy ghost, yet continually, as long as we liue in this life, there cleaueth to our nature a natural corrup tion, whose guiltnesse is forgeuen in Baptisme, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of which corruption the godly can not performe that whiche they would. For this cause made the Apostle this exclamation: O wretched man that I am, who shall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer me from this body subiecte vnto death? For he had a <note place="margin">Rom. vii</note> litle before sayde: That whiche I woulde, I do not, but that whiche I hate, that I doo: but I knowe that there dwelleth no good in me, that is, in my fleshe. For to will is present with me, but I finde no meanes to doo good. For I do not the good thing whiche I woulde, but the euill whiche I would not, that I do. And agayne: The fleshe lusteth agaynst the spirite, and the spirite agaynst <note place="margin">Galat. v</note> the flesh: and these are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary one to the other, so that ye can not do the same thinges that ye would.</p>
            <p>This doctrine is necessary, whereby also they y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> are in dede godly, do vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> howsoeuer they are regenerat yet they ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not perfectly accomplish the lawe of God, lest peraduenture they should fall into a pernitious doubt, if they should see in them selues also this imbec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>llitie of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature not vtterly and wholly regenerate, against whiche infirmitie we must continually thorough y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> grace of the holy ghost fight with a true faith.</p>
            <p>The 28. Canon, manifestly teacheth that the Counsell of Trent is not gouerned by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> holy ghost, but is infected
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19130:13"/>
with the spirite of error. For they teache that a dead faith is a true faith, and that he whiche is endewed with a dead faith is neuerthelesse a Christian, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that thinke other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they curse. But these two pointes are playnly &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly contrary &amp; opposite vnto the doctrine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. For a true faith is a lyuely faith, the gift of the holy ghost, whereby man is ioyned vnto Christe, but that faith whiche is not lyuely, can not be a true faith. And here let <note place="margin">ii. Thes. iii. ii. Cor. xiii. Eph. iii.</note> them heare what Iames sayth, whose authoritie in other places they somuch extoll. Thou beleu est (sayth he) that there is but one God? Thou doest wel, the deuils also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue and tremble, wherefore it is the fayth of deuils, and not a true fayth, whiche is not a liuely confidence in the <note place="margin">Iames. ii.</note> mercy of God promysed by his sonne, and so is it nothyng ells, than a humane and vayne persuasion, wherwith the greatest part of the world being deceaued falleth into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal destruction And euen as thou mayest call the payne ted image of a man, a man, so mayest thou also call suche a persuasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, faith, which yet is not a true faith.</p>
            <p>But what a madnesse is it, to call him a Christian, whiche is endued with thys dead fayth without charitye? <note place="margin">Gala. v.</note> Saint Paule sayth: In Christ Iesus neyther circumcision is of any force nor vncircumcision, but fayth workyng through loue. And to the Cor. he writeth. If I haue not <note place="margin">i.

But the councel of Trent acknowledgeth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> man to be a Christian whiche is without charitye.</p>
            <p>Hitherto they haue imputed to our teachers y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they teach a naked fayth contemning charitye, wherein they do vnto them greate iniurye: But nowe these good holy fathers themselues acknowledge them for Christians, which are without charitye, and they counte a dead fayth for a true fayth: Omittyng to speake more sharply, what blyndnesse is thys?</p>

Wherein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the iuste iudgement of GOD is to be considered: for for as muche as they of purpose and obstinatlye oppose them selues agaynst the light of the truth, and do holde it backe in vnryghteousnesse, they are worthy of suche so greate blindnesse, whereby God punisheth sinnes with <note place="margin">Rom. i.</note> synnes.</p>
            <p>In the 30. Canon they confirme satisfaction for the guiltnesse of temporall payne and also the fire of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, wherin maye be satisfied the Iustice of God for the guiltnesse of temporall payne.</p>
            <p>Eyther of these errors are a derogatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> merite of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> pas sio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; death of Christ, &amp; they declare also, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the Counsell is vtterly ignorant what it is to obteine or to haue remissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of sinnes. For the holy scripture doth testifie, that al they whose synnes are forgeuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are in the grace &amp; fauor of God as it is written: I will be mercyful to their iniquitie, <note place="margin">Ierem. xx<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> peace was vpon him. And Iohn in his Canonical Epistle <note place="margin">ii. Iohn. i ii. Iohn. ii</note> writeth: The bloud of Iesus Christe his sonne cleanseth vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all sinne. Also: He is the propitiation for the sinnes of the whole world. These testimonies of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the olde and newe Testament doo manifestlye
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19130:14"/>
teache that besides the obedience of Christe made in the fleshe there is no other satisfaction for synnes: and that they are fowlely deceaued which do put some part of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction eyther in theyr owne passions or elles in their fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned purgatorye.</p>
            <p>To deuide in halfe the merite of the passion of Christ, is vtterly to abolish his meryte: for he is no halfe or vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect redemer but a perfect redemer, with one oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Epistle to the Hebrewes) hath he for euer made perfect those, which are sanctified. Heb. x.</p>
            <p>But bycause they see that the expiation or satisfaction for synnes is by moste manifeste testimonyes of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture attributed onely vnto Christe, they goe aboute to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde them by a vayne distinction, when, they teache, that the synnes themselues are not expiated, but that for the eternall payne dew vnto synnes the satisfaction of temporall payne is expiation made, but in affyrmyng of these thynges, they shewe in very deede that they are vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ignoraunt, what remission of synnes is. For what other thyng ells is remission of synne, than that God fyrst receaueth vs into fauoure, and forgeueth the faulte of synnes, then also he remitteth the punyshemente whiche we haue deserued by our synnes? Wherfore where there is not a full and perfecte remission of payne, but that some satisfaction is requyred, there also is not a full and perfecte remission of synnes. I knowe the Councell of Trent can not vnloose thys knotte, and if thys be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest to be the doctrine of the holy Ghost, then will fal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way theyr satisfactions for synnes and the fyre of purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torye shal easiy be quenched.</p>
            <p>And although the Lord somtimes do some what more seuerely chaste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those whose sinnes he remitteth according to hys will, as he vnderstandeth to bee expediente for

            <p>I thought good to admonishe the godly reader of all these thinges before I tooke in hande to confute the rest of the decrees and Canons, whiche were made vnder the Bishop of Rome Pius the fourth concerning the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes: all which namely decrees and Canons seing they were allowed by the Counsell gathered together the laste yeare, they whiche are but meanely instructed in the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of pietie may most manifestly see, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> there is no good thing to be hoped for at their handes.</p>

            <p>Where as there are fiue principall feast dayes, wherein the benefites of the sonne of God are yearely celebrated in the Churche: the feastes of the Natiuitie of Christ, of hys Passion, Resurrection, and Ascencion into heauen, also the feast of Whitsontyde. Of all these feastes the Fathers of the Counsell of Trent haue left vs nothyng, but the names and truth of the historye, whiche is also in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilles, vnto whiche fathers thou mayst most aptly apply this sayeng of Paul. They professe that they know God, but in dedes they deny hym, when as they are abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <note place="margin">Titus. i.</note> and not harknyng to his worde, and reprobate to all good workes.</p>
            <p>For the power and fruite of the holye Natiuitie of Christe is to purge and make cleane our vnpure Natiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, <note place="margin">Psalme. li</note> whiche were conceaued, borne, and dead in synnes. The Counsell of Trent extenuateth the power of thys, whilest they extenuate the disease of originall synne, and denye it to be properly called sinne.</p>
            <p>The vertue and fruite of the Passion and death of Christ, is a perfect satisfaction for the sinnes of the whole worlde, and a full remission thorough the mercy of God. Contrarily the Counsell extenuateth the vertue of thys merite, &amp; teacheth that for the temporall payne of sinnes, we may satisfie both in this life by good workes, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life in Purgatorye.</p>
            <p>The vertue and fruite of the resurrection of Christ is, that all they whiche beleue in Christe are iustified from <note place="margin">i. Cor. i ii.

            <p>The vertue and fruite of the Ascension of Christe into heauen, and of his sitting at the right hande of the father (from whence also he sent the holy ghost vnto hys Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles) is, that he onely &amp; alone hath opened the gate of the kyngdome of heauen, is a continuall intercessor for vs <note place="margin">Ephe. iiii</note> vnto the father, and sealeth our hearts with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> holy ghost, as with a pledge &amp; earnest peny, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the faithfull shoulde be certaine and not doubte of the fauor &amp; mercye of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <note place="margin">Ephe. i Rom. viii. ii.

            <p>But rather this ought continually to be the study of a Christian man, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> we should fight against this distrust and doubting, whiche is naturally in vs, and cleaueth vnto vs euen against our willes, and expell it, so far is it of, that it should be a prayse of pietie modestie or humilitie, bycause of our infirmitie to doubte of the grace of God offred vs in Christ. The holy fathers of the Counsell iudge, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it can not want the sinne of arrogancie if a man hauing no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde to his owne infirmitie do assuredly appoynt of the grace of God towardes him selfe. In the meane time they consider not, how great a wickednes it is to accuse god in his promises of vanitie &amp; lying, Who hauyng no regards to our infirmitie promiseth &amp; offreth his fauor in Christs to vs beyng vnworthy and wicked, and doth most seuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admonish, and vnder the payne of hell fire commaunde vs, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> as repentaunt sinners, we should without all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or doubt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, with a true and firme faith embrace it.

            </p>
            <p>And thus much of the doctrine whiche the Counsell of Trent, in the yeare. 1547, confirmed agaynst the expresse word of God to establish their olde errors.</p>
            <p>In the seuenth and last session they began to make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees also of the Sacramentes whiche are added as seales vnto the heauenly doctrine, wherin the promises of God concernyng his free fauor towarde vs, are sealed, and our fayth confirmed.</p>
            <p>But I will not dispute long of these their decrees, whose true and manifeste confutation is of late set a bro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In the first Canon they curse those whiche beleue not, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> there are seuen Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, being so most properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led &amp; instituted of Christ him self.

            <p>And thus much of the Sacramentes in generall: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may coniecture that the fathers of the Councel wil correcte no erroure, abuse or Idolatrye, for as muche as they will not for peace and concorde sake so muche as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the least rytes and ceremonies, wherin there is none or small helpe, but haue decreed to retayne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with tooth and nayle.</p>

For the olde Easter beyng finished, whiche the multitude of the chyldren
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19130:26"/>
of Israell offred for a memoriall of their Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of Egypte, he instituted a newe Easter, namely that he hym selfe shoulde bee offred vp of the Churche by the Priestes for a memoriall of hys passage out of thys worlde vnto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: when as he hath by the sheadyng of hys bloude redemed vs and delyuered vs from the power of darkenesse, and transferred vs into hys kyngdome. And this is that cleane oblation which can not be defyled by any vnworthynes or malice of the offerers, whiche also the Lorde by Malachy foretolde shoulde in euery place beyng cleane be offred in hys name, whiche shoulde be greate among the heathen, of whiche also Paule meant wrytyng vnto the Corinthians, when he sayeth that they whiche are defyled by participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the table of deuilles can not be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the table of the Lorde, vnderstandyng in both places by the Table the altare. This also is lastely that oblation whiche was figured by the similitude of so many sacrifices in the tyme of nature and of the lawe, as whiche comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all thynges by them signified as it were the consu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mation and perfection of them all.</p>
               <p>Bycause in thys diuine sacrifice whyche is done in the Masse, that selfe same Christe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned, and vnbloudily inuiolated, whiche once bloudily offred hym selfe vpon the altare of the Crosse, the holy Synode teacheth that this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19130:26"/>
is in very deede propitiatorye and by it is brought to passe that if with true hart and fulnes of fayth, with feare and reuerence, we come con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite &amp; repentant vnto god, we may obtaine mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye and fynde grace in helpe of opportunitye. For the Lorde being pacifyed with the oblation hereof, forgeueth greate crimes and synnes, and geueth grace and glorye: For it is one and the selfe same sacrifyce, the selfe same in number is offered by the ministerye of the priestes whiche then offered hymselfe vpon the Crosse differyng only by the manner of offryng the frute of which oblation, (of the bloudye oblation I saye) is by thys vnbloudy oblation most abundauntly recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, so farre is it of that it should by any meanes by this be derogated. Wherfore (accordi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> tra dition of the Apostles) it is ryghtlye offred for the faythfull, not onely suche as be quicke but also for the dead in Christe, not yet purged to the full, for theyr sinnes, for their satisfactions and other necessityes.</p>
               <p>And although the Churche hath sometymes vsed to celebrate certayne Masses in the honoure and memorye of Saints, yet it teacheth not that sacrifyce is offered vnto them, but vnto God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whiche hath crowned them, wherefore the prieste vseth not to saye: I offer sacrifyce vnto thee O Peter or Paule, but geuyng thankes vnto GOD for theyr victoryes, and imploring
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19130:27"/>
theyr aydes, he exhorteth al men to imitate them.</p>
               <p>Farther forasmuch as it is conuenient that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinges should be administred holily; and this sacrifice is of al thinges most holy, the Catholyke Church, to the ende it should worthily and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentlye be offered &amp; receaued, instituteth a sacred Canon, so pure fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all manner of error, that there is nothing contained therin, which doth not geue a great swete sauoure of a certayne holinesse and piety, and erecteth the mynde of the offerers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.</p>
               <p>And for asmuch as the nature of men is such, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it can not easely without outward helpes be lifted vp vnto the meditation of thinges deuine, for that cause the Godly mother y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Church hath instituted certayn rites, namely that certayne things in the masse should be pronounced with a soft voice and other certayn with a louder voyce, it hath also ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned Ceremonyes, as mysticall benedictions, lightes, incenses, vestments, and many such other lyke thinges, taken out of the Apostolicall Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and tradition, whereby both the maiestie of so great a sacrifice shoulde be commended, and the mindes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> saythful should by these visible signes of religion and pietye, be stirred vp vnto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of thyngs most high, which lye hidden in this sacrifice.</p>
               <p>The sacred Sinode would in dede wyshe, that in all Masses, some of the faythfull shoulde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19130:27"/>
that the fruit of that most holy sacrifice might come vnto many: and yet though it come not alwayes so to passe, doth it not therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne those Masses, wherein the Priest alone sacramentally communicateth, as priuate &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, but rather alloweth and comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for that those Masses also ought in very dede to be counted common, partly bycause in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the peo ple spiritually co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municateth, and partely bycause they are celebrated by the publicque minister of the Churche not for him selfe only, but also for all the faithfull, whiche pertayne vnto the body of Christe.</p>
               <p>Farther the holy Synode admonisheth that commaundement is geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the Church vnto the Priests, to mingle water with the wine that is offred in the chalice, both bycause it is thought that the Lorde Christe did so, and also bycause out of hys syde came forth water together with bloude, whiche Sacrament is by this mixture kepte in memorye, that for as muche as peoples are in the Apocalipse of blessed Iohn called wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnion of the faithfull people with the head Christ should be represented.</p>

            <p>At the first the Counsell endeuoreth to set forth it selfe with a shepes clothyng: for it promiseth the olde, absolute and fully perfecte fayth and doctrine of the Euchariste. These thynges if a manne that is in dede godly shoulde heare, what hope would not he conceaue that it shoulde come to passe, that the true vse of the Supper of the Lorde shoulde be restored accordyng to the institution of Christe, and doctrine of the Apostles, and practise of the primatiue Churche? For the doctrine of Christ &amp; of the Apostles is most auncient, &amp; it is onely absolute and fully perfecte. Neither also is the practise of the primatiue Church vnknowen, whiche religiously obserued both the doctrine and also the rites delyuered them by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.

               </gap>n the life of Sixtus the firste, Byshoppe of Rome, howe bare and simple the celebration of the Supper of the Lorde was, when as rites and ceremonies were as yet viterly vnknowen, whiche the latter age added vnto it without the worde of the Lorde. This simplicitie (I saye) and purenesse godly men would thinke the Counsell pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19130:29"/>
by these theyr wordes, if they had not strayght way added thinges that are directly repugnant with the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Christ and of the Apostles.</p>
            <p>For it teacheth that the Eucharist is a true and a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular sacrifice, and it decreeth that it ought to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto all the faythfull and to be inculcated into their heartes.</p>
            <p>Neither do we contend about this worde sacrifice, the Eucharist also maye after his manner be called a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, bycause it comprehendeth the memorye of the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Christe, and a thankesgeuing of the faithfull. And that this was not the meanyng of the holy fathers, they manifestly shewe, when they affirme: that it is a true and singular sacrifice propitiatory, and not onely a memoriall of an other sacrifice, whiche thyng they will a litle after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde more expressedly decree, and in their Canons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme with a curse.</p>
            <p>But let vs briefly examine the reasons &amp; argumentes, by whiche they go aboute to confirme the sacrifice of the Masse. The firste argument is: In the olde Testament by reason of the imbecillitie of the sacrifice of Leui, there was no perfection. Wherefore in the newe Testament, it behoued that one shoulde rise, namely our Lorde Iesus Christe whiche myght accomplishe and bryng to perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion euen as many as were to be sanctifyed. To this we aunswere, that we graunte the whole argument, and with the Apostle we affirme that the selfe same thyng is accomplished in the Passion and death of Christe, The precepte (sayeth he) that went before was abrogated, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of imbecillitie, and among them were many made Priestes, bycause they were not suffered to endure by reason of death. But this man, bycause he endureth for euer, hath an euerlastyng Priesthoode, wherefore he is able also fully to saue those whiche come vnto GOD
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19130:30"/>
by hym, euer lyuyng, to this ende to maké intercession for vs. And least any man shoulde vnderstande thys of any other Sacrifice than of that whiche was done vpon the Crosse, strayght waye he addeth: Thys he dyd once, when he offred vp hym selfe. And in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>: <q>Not that he shoulde offer hym selfe often, as the hygh Priest entred into the holy place euerye yeare with straunge bloude, for then must he haue often suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred since the creation of the worlde. But nowe in the ende of the worlde hath he appeared <hi>Once</hi> to put away synne, by the Sacrifice of hym selfe. And as it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted vnto men that they shall dye once and after that commeth the iudgement, So Christe was <hi>Once</hi> offred to take awaye the synnes of many.</q> These testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Apostle do moste manifestly teache that the imbecillity of the Sacrifices of Leui is taken away by the sole and onely sacrifice of the Crosse. And so far <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t of, that the Sacrifice of the Masse can be confirmed by this argumente, that it can scarcely by any more strong argument be ouerthrowen. For if it shoulde dayly be offred by Priestes, whiche are as muche mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall as were the Priestes of Leui, and also haue their successors, how should it differ from the Leuiticall Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of imbecillity? For the Leuiticall Sacrifice bycause of imbecillity was done euery yeare: but the sacrifice of Christ bycause of hys perfection was done but once.</p>
            <p>The seconde argument is: The priesthoode of Christe was not to be extinguished by hys death. Therefore the Eucharist is a sacrifice. The Aunswere. I deny the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence. For the priesthode of Christ is not extinguished, although the Eucharist be not conuerted into a sacrifice. For how Christ doth the office of an eternal priest in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, the scripture euery where teacheth. For for as muche as there are thre offices belongyng to a Priest, namely to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19130:30"/>
teach, to offer and to pray: al these things he hath not only fulfilled in hys flesh, but also the power therof hath indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red euen from the creation of the worlde, and shall indure vnto the end therof. For concerning the will of hys father he taught from the. xxx. yere of his age euen vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>. xxxiiii yeare. Farther in the dayes of hys fleshe when with a <note place="margin">Heb. v.</note> stronge crye and teares he offred both prayers and also supplications vnto hym whiche coulde deliuer hym from death, he was heard for reuerence sake. Lastly he offred himself vpon the aulter of the crosse an oblation vnto god <note place="margin">Esay. liii. ii. Cor. v</note> the father for the sinnes of the whole worlde, for a swete smelling sauour vnto the Lord. Seing therfore Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus is thys day, yesterday, and for euer (as the Apostle say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) which was vnto mankinde euen from the beginnyng the word of the father the messanger of hys will, by whose hand also the law was geuen, by whom it was to bee ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled. So also y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> power of the sacrifice, which he wroughte vpon the crosse, hath indured in all tymes, wherby all the <note place="margin">Gal. iii.</note> Patriarches thorough fayth obtayned eternal lyfe, which thyng the Apostle signifyed by this aduerb (yesterday) The <note place="margin">Heb. i.</note> selfe same power of this sacrifice indureth not only nowe presently, but also with all our posterityes, and that for euer. Likewise y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of his prayer &amp; intercession indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <note place="margin">Rom. viii.</note> for euer, who sitting at the right hande of the father, maketh intercession continually for vs.</p>
            <p>Whe as therfore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> true vse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> supper, which is an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting &amp; not an oblation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body &amp; bloud of Christ in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, extinguisheth not this his perfect, absolute, perpetual &amp; eternal sacrifice, for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> cause al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly may iudge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thys reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fathers is weak to establsh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrifice of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> masse</p>
            <p>The thyrde argument: Christ is a priest accordyng to the order of Melchisedech. Melchisedech offred bread and wine, Therfore the Eucharist is a sacrifyce for the quicke and the dead. Thou wilt meruayle Christian Reader at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme of thys Sillogesmus, whiche in no poynt hangeth
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:19130:31"/>
together, but vndoubtedly such are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reasons of al main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayners of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> papacye, otherwise thys argument will be no defence vnto them. For if it were brought into a forme, thys shoulde be the argument. Melchisedech the priest of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred bread and wyne. Christ is a priest accordyng to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Melchisedech. Therefore in the Supper he offred bread and wine. By this conclusion not only theyr trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation shall fall, but also the sacrifice of the bodye and bloud of Christ shall vtterly be nothyng. For Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedech offred not the body of Christ, but bread, but the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes say Christ offred hys own body and not bread. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the maior or fyrst part we answere. That Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedech neuer offred vnto God the Father bread and wine which thyng they can neuer proue by the text, but offred them vnto Abraham and hys companions, whom as they returned weary fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the victory he refreshed, which thing this Hebrew word <hi>Hotsia</hi> declareth, which signifyeth not to offer, but to profer. And if Melchisedech were to bee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with Christ in consideration of bread and wine, the author of the Epistle vnto the Hebrewes whatsoeuer he was, being vndoubtedly a diligente searcher of the holy scriptures, would by no meanes haue left it vnspoken of, wherof yet he maketh no mention at all. But in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fathers vsed not only thys fygure, but also the name of a sacrifice, it is not to be doubted, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they vnderstode not on ly the memorye of thys sacrifice, but also thought by thys meanes to helpe theyr imbecilitye, whiche were accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the sacrifyces eyther of the Iewes or of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. There withal also they laboured to repel the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie of those, which cryed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christian people contrarye to the manners and custome of all nations and peoples wandred without any outward and publicque sacrifyce. Wherfore they opposed agaynst all men as well Iewes as Gentiles the Eucharist, wherein not only al the godly and faythfull communicated in the bodye and bloude of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19130:31"/>
Christ, but also a publique and solemne memoriall of the sacrifice y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> was done vpon the crosse was celebrated with <note place="margin">Heb. 13.</note> thankesgeuing, that is (as the Epistle to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hebrewes say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) by him the sacrifice of prayse was offred vnto God, that is, the fruite of the lippes that confesse hys name.</p>
            <p>In this place also is diligently to be noted the inconsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye and shorte memory of the Councel of Trent, for that here it affyrmeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> by the sacrifyce of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Masse is represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a sacrifice propitiatory, but afterward it stryketh with a curse those which denye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the sacrifice of the masse it self is the very sacrifyce propitiatorye for the synnes of the quicke and the dead, whereof we will speake in his place.</p>
            <p>But wheras they say that in the sacrifice of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> masse is represented the bloudy sacrifice y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> was done once vpon the crosse, what other thing do they make of the masse than a Paschal or Easter play? From which in this thing only y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> masse differeth, bycause in a Paschal play the historye of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> passion of Christ is represented by many persons, but in the papisticall masse, al things are done by one only sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing priest. If a man shoulde demaunde of them, by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thys sportfull and histrionicall representation was insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, which consisteth in outward gestures, they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bring forth neither the Apostles, nor Christ, as it is a litle before shewed out of <hi>Platina.</hi> For these histrionicall gestures of these sacrifycing priests were vtterly vnknowen vnto the Apostles and vnto the primatiue church.</p>
            <p>But wheras the holy fathers of the counsell saye, that Christ in hys last supper offred vnto God the father hys body and bloud vnder the formes of bread and wyne, that is by the same simplicitye of all the Godly reiected as of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Counsel it is affyrmed, for thereof they can neyther bring out a testimonye of the holy scripture, nor yet a testimony of any al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>o wed writer as our men haue in other places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundauntly declared.</p>
            <p>Of the self same authoritye is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which they affyrme of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:19130:32"/>
the Apostles, namely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Christ by these words: <hi>Do thys in re membraunce of me,</hi> ordained the Apostles priests of the new Testament. For they fayne that a peculiar kynde of men was ordayned and instituted to celebrate thys sacrifyce, namely priestes, whiche shoulde daily for the sinnes of the quicke and the dead offer the sacrifyce of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> masse in a play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers garment accustomed to be vsed in the Romysh church.</p>
            <p>But there is none so rude in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy scriptures, which seeth not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the counsel is to farre out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> waye in thys thing. For forasmuch as sacraments ar added as seales vnto doctryne, the administration of them is geuen in charge vnto them, vnto whome the ministerye of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching is committed. Wherefore euen as Christ by thys worde, Baptyze ye, ordayned not a certayne kynde of lyfe of Baptizers, so also by these woordes (doe thys) he ordayned not any certayn order of sacrifycers, which thorough out the whole papacye are as apt to teache, as is an Asse to play on the harpe. And suche is the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of an infinite number of sacrifycing priestes that thei are not ashamed to say, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it pertayneth not to their dutye and office to teach in the Church, whiche are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered only for three thinges in the masse (as a certayne one of this kynde of great learned men spake) and that by these formal wordes. <q>Receaue power to offer sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyce vnto God &amp; to celebrate masses both for the quicke <note place="margin">In the pon tifical boke folio. 20 <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.</note> and dead, in the name of the Lord.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth argument: In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old Testament y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Paschall Lambe was not only eaten, but also offred vp. Therefore in the Supper of the Lorde also, which was signifyed by the Paschal Lambe, the bodye of the Lorde is not only to be eaten, but also to be offred vp. I deny the consequence. For the Apostle Paul comparing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Easter of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Easter of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> new Testament, writeth: For our <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5</note> easter also was offred vp eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ, he sayth not is offred vp, &amp; shalbe offred vp in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Eucharist, but was offred vp, vn

dersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the sacrifice y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> was done vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crosse. For eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the immolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Paschal lambe was a bloudy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molation, so also Christ vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the crosse offred vnto the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a bloudy sacrifice for the sinnes of the whole world. Therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> immolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the paschal lamb, doth no way confirme the idolatrous sacrifice of the Masse, which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall Lambe, was a fygure and type of the Sacrifice that should be made vpon the crosse.</p>

            <p>The sixt argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. The Apostle writing vnto the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s saith: ye ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be pertakers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> table of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lorde, &amp; of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> table of deuils. On y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> tables of deuils were made obla tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Wherfore also on the table of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord is an oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body &amp; bloud of Christ. There is no reason at al of this con sequence. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> apostle dothe of this thing onelye admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Corinthians, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> supper of the Lord, wherin is celebrated the memory of the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the crosse, oughte not to communicate w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the sacred
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19130:33"/>
things of the gentiles in whose name so euer they come: For they were offred vnto deuils &amp; not to God, although the Gentiles thought they offred sacrifices vnto the true and liuely God. But by this place the aduersaryes shall neuer proue, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the Eucharist is a sacrifyce propitiatorye, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostle calleth the Supper of the Lord, and in no place a sacrifice. And al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> see how weake this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequence of the Councel is: Paule in eyther place vnderstandeth an alter, therfore in eyther place is sacrifyce made. But what if in eyther place he vnderstode not an alter? He calleth it the table of the Lord and not an alter. These arguments in an euill cause are farre soughte and fetcht and they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in vayne by wordes &amp; coniectures to establysh that, which may be confuted by the institution of Christe and manifest testimonyes of Paule.</p>
            <p>The last argument is taken of the custome of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches and Iewes, vnlesse peraduenture they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Gentiles also vnder the name of (nature) as in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> last former Councell in the yeare. 1551. A Monke at Trent openly preached: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the Gentles are by the lawe of nature saued without Christ. The argumente is. To a fygure or shadowe aunswereth a body. The sacrifices of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Gentiles and Iewes signifyed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrifyce of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Eucharist. Therfore the Eucharist is a sacrifyce. Of the sacrifices of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gentiles we wil now say nothyng, whose gods are deuils, &amp; theyr sacrifices are sacrifices of deuils, and not of God. But on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we will speake of the sacrifyces of the Iewes, which no Christian man denyeth but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they were types and figures of Christ. And they wer types of the sacrifyce y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> was made vpon the crosse, as we haue before shewed oute of Paule: bycause the sacrifyce of the crosse was the consummation and perfection of all the Leuiticall sacrifices. Wherefore y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> minor or second proposition is simply to be denyed, for as much as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewysh sacrifices shadowed not the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist, but the sacrifyce which was made vpon the crosse.</p>

In the which doctrine or decree ar confyrmed two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious errours: One is: That masses are to be celebrated in the honour of saintes. The other is: that the aydes and helpes of saintes are to be implored: both whiche are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnaunt vnto the expresse word of God. For Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted not the Eucharist to the memorye of saintes, but for the commemoration of hys death: do this (sayth he) in remembrance of me, &amp; not of my mother or of my saints. Paule calleth it the shewing forth of the death of Christs <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> and not of saintes.</p>
            <p>For although it be not of it selfe vngodlye, euen in the vse of the Eucharist to make mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the saints, whiche haue valtantly lost theyr liues for the glory of Christ, and constantlye shed theyr bloude, in confessing of hym, as we rede was done in the primatiue church: yet is it synne and a horrible prophanation of the Supper, to teachy<hi rend="sup">•</hi> by thys worke wrought the aydes and helpes of saintes are deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and applyed vnto them: When as in the Euchariste Christ dealeth with the faythfull, and the faythfull with Christ, and not with dead saintes.</p>
            <p>But of it selfe it is wicked and idolatrous to call vpon saintes.

But I wil not make any long con futation of them, but briefly make mention of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall errors, whiche at the fyrst sight the godly reader shall perceaue are repugnaunt vnto the holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>The fyrst error: Strayght way in the beginning of the Canon, the Priest speaketh thus: For who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we offer vnto thee, or els, whiche offer vnto thee this sacrifice of prayse both for himselfe and for all hys, <hi>for the redemption of theyr soules.</hi> Thou seest here Christian Reader not only a small error, but also horrible impietye: a sacrifycing prieste to offer the sacrifice of the masse for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of soules when as all the soules of the Badly are by the sacrifyce of Christe done vpon the Crosse redemed from the anger of God, from sinnes, and from hell, as it is written vnto the Hebrewes: Christ the high priest of good things to come, by hys owne proper bloud hath entred once into the holy <note place="margin">Heb. ix.</note>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:19130:36"/>
place, hauing obtayned eternall redemption.</p>
            <p>The seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d error. After mention made of the Apostles &amp; of certayne saintes, the priest addeth: By whose merites &amp; prayers we beseche the graunt, that in all things we may be defended by the ayde of thy protection.</p>
            <p>What merites I pray you haue the saintes, by whiche we get the protection of God? The sainctes could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue <note place="margin">Luke. xvii.</note> any thing for them selues, how the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they succor vs by their merites? If ye shal do al thinges (sayth Christ) say ye we are vnprofitable seruants. Paul also: God forbid y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> I should glory but in the crosse of our Lord Iesus Christ. <note place="margin">Gal. v. Phillip. iii.</note> Also: I thinke all things but losse for the excellent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge sake of Iesus Christ my Lord, for whom I haue cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all thynges losse, and doe iudge them to be dongue, that I might winne Christ. What shal the losses of saints be merites vnto vs of the protection of God? whiche are protected by the merite only of Christ.</p>
            <p>In like maner also must we iudge of the prayers &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessions of saints, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scripture we are sent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ our only intercessor, who is in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (saith Paul) <note place="margin">Rom. viii.

            <p>The fourth error. <q>The sacrificing priest prayeth: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde these thynges (namely the bodye and bloude of Christ) to be caryed by the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of thy holy Angel into thy hygh alter, into the sight of thy diuine Maiestye.</q> What absurditye is thys: Is not Christ with hys body alwayes in heauen and also in the syght of the father? Doth he day lye ascend and discend? Or is he by the handes of Angells caryed downe from heauen into the earth, or caryed vp from the earth into heauen?</p>
            <p>But these good holy fathers say: That the body whiche is made of the substance of the bread, was not before in heauen, bycause it is newly created by the consecration of the sacrificing priest. If thys be true, then haue not the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing priestes the true body of Christ which was ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged vpon the crosse: For y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is not of the substance of the bread, but of the substance of the blessed Uirgine Mary. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there shal not be only two bodyes but infinite bodies of Christ in heauen, if as often as the priest sayth Masse, the body of Christ created of a new substance of bread is by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ministery of Angels caried vp into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Who vnder standeth not thys grosse error, which is ryghtly instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> supper of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord? In the which supper y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> same bodye of Christ which is in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is also after a spiritual ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner agreable to Christs diuine maiesty truly prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithof y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> godly receauer, whersoeuer his holy supper is celebrated</p>
            <p>Neyther also can the sacrifycing priests wrap themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues out of thys two horned argument. If the Aungel cary the body of Christ into heauen, there is nothing then lefte <note place="margin">Dilemma.</note> for the sacrifycer. But if the sacrifycer swallowe it vp, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> descendeth the Angell in vayne, and is sent away emptye. These things of the Canon are not only erronious, but also rediculous and childyshe inuentions.</p>
            <p>The fyfth error: In the Canon, purgatory and suffrages
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19130:37"/>
and sacrifyces for the dead are confyrmed. <q>Remember also Lord (sayth he) thy men seruaunts and women ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts, which haue gone before vs w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the signe of faith, and slepe in the slepe of peace.</q> N. we beseche thee Lorde geue vnto them and all those y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> rest in Christ a place of refreshing, light, and peace. This error euen these their owne words confute, in whiche is contayned manifest contradiction. For if the faythfull y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> are dead doe slepe, and are in peace, light, and at rest, what is it nedefull to desire it for them? But if they be in darkenesse, in paine and most great terrors &amp; sorowes (as it is before sayde out of Discipulus touching the paynes of the soules in purgatorye) howe are they then sayde to sleepe in the sleepe of peace?</p>
            <p>That prayers and sacrifices of the quicke nothing profyte the dead, we haue before shewed, neyther is it nedefull in this place to repeate it agayne.</p>
            <p>The last error is comprehended in the last prayer of the Canon: <q>Let this performance of my seruice O holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitye (sayth the priest) please thee, and graunt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifyce, which I vnworthy, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> I am, haue offred vnto the eyes of thy maiestye, may be pleasaunte and acceptable vnto thee, and may thorough thy mercy be propitiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye for me and all those for whom I haue offred it into euerlasting life. Amen.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The same error also is before put in the beginning of the Cannon, but with other wordes. For y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> whiche he there sayd he offred for the redemption of soules, the same now he sayth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he offred it a propitiatorye sacrifyce. Doth he not manifestly in this place attribute y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to the execution of his seruice, which is proper to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death and passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ He y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> seeth not these things is blinde.

auoyded of all them that be in dede godly.</p>
            <p>In y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vii. decree are confirmed priuate Masses brought in for gaynes sake.

But this is to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme a grosse error by other ii. no lesse grosse. For Christ in his last sup per instituted not a priuate supper of one man only, but a spiritual &amp; celestial ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quet, wherin he did not eat &amp; drynke for his disciples, but all and singular did eate &amp; drynke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for them selues to departe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this institution, &amp; to institute a spectacle of one man only in the Churche, and that not only with out the word of God, but also against the worde of God, is sacriledge.</p>
            <p>Farther y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> custome of the primatiue Churche is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel. For as many as did not sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Howbeit in the meane time we deny not, but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they which are truly godly do spiritually communicate w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the body of Christ, as often as with a true faith they thinke vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> passion &amp; death of <note place="margin">In his 48. ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of the 12. frutes of the Masse.</note> Christ. But this spirituall eating confirmeth not priuate Masses, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> are not instituted of christ. But I thinke it good in this place to recite out of <hi>Discipulus</hi> what the Papistes vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by spirituall eating. <q>Whensoeuer (saith he) any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deuoutly heareth Masse, being in grace, and without deadly sinne, &amp; hath a desyre to be partaker of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thinketh thus in his heart, O good Lord Iesus Christ how willingly would I receaue the this day in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the altar, but alas I dare not come nere, by cause I am feard to offend y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> by reason of myne vnaptnes.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:19130:39"/>
Howbeit I humbly desyre thee from the bottom of my hart, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou wilt thys day mercyfully bestow vpon me also this grace, whiche these deuoute me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall receaue, which thys day in the Church of God worthily receaue thee in the sacrament of the alter, and so such a one spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually communicateth.</q> But what Scholemaster had this Disciple which is so famous in the Churche of the Papacye, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is counted the Scholemaster of al the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifycing priestes? Truly hath he the name of a Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for he hath nede both of doctrine &amp; a scholemaster, for he hymselfe can not teache true pietye. Or what is hys authoritye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we shoulde beleue hym withoute the word of God, whose opinions &amp; fables are euery where celebrated in Churches the popes good holynesse not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstandyng them? vnlesse peraduenture the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritye of the Councell do now succor hym. For of thys communicating the holy Scriptures teache nothing at all, but call all such as repent vnto the sacramental ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the body of Christ.</p>
            <p>The other is a muche more grosse and more in tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble error, whiche the Councell in thys place confyrmeth, namely, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the sacrifycer maye communicate for other, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the standers by or for the dead.

            <p>In the eight decree, the holy Synode admonisheth as a commaundement of the Churche, that in offryng, wyne shall be mingled with water. Wherof there are thre rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons brought, and yet none of them confirme this tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. First it sayeth: bycause it is supposed that Christ the Lord did so. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ut for as muche as fayth leaneth vnto the worde of God and promise of God, where I beseche you is the worde that Christe mingled wyne with water? or commaunded it to be mingled? How then can the Church beleue without the worde? It shalbe good here to recite that whiche was reasoned as touchyng this thyng in the laste former Counsell the Cardinalles and Byshoppes beyng present. For some of the disputers affirmed that it must vtterly be graunted, that it can not be proued by any expresse testimony of the holy Scripture, that Christ mingled water with wyne, but yet out of the Gospell may be brought an vndoubted coniecture, wherby may be proued that Christe did so. Bycause in Marke we reade, that Christe sayd vnto his Disciples whiche went <note place="margin">Marke. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Thou wilt thinke peraduenture Chri stian reader that I fayne these things of myne owne hed. But God is my iudge, that our me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which were sent vnto the Counsell of Trent did not only heare him reason after this maner, but also testified, that this enormeous rashe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and impiety aboue measure displeased the Bishops of Germany, whiche thing the Bishops the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>f they lust, can very well testifie.</p>
            <p>They can lesse proue it by the other reason, namely that out of the syde of Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>owed bloud and water. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For they affyrme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> out of the side of Christ flowed two Sacramentes Baptisme and the Eucharist.</p>
            <p>The third reason is altogether ridiculous, althoughe it be not without his authors. As thoughe the vnion of the faythfull people with the bed Christ can by no other meanes be taught, vnlesse thys mixture of water and wyne be brought into the Eucharist without the worde of God? Why haue they brought matrymony among the Sacramentes wherin is represented the vnion of Christ with the hed, if the same thyng may be done by the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of water and wyne.</p>
            <p>In the ninth decree, to the ende they might seme to graunt somewhat of theyr right, the holy Synode com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth the Pastors that in the celebration of the Masse, some what of those things whiche are read in the Canon,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:19130:40"/>
should be expounded in the vulgare tongue.</p>
            <p>But what is the cause, why all thinges are not done in the vulgare tongue? when as the Eucharist was institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for all the faythfull, that the Lorde myght with one mouth be celebrated? Forsoth the holy fathers are affraid, lest the holy mystery should be prophaned, but let them declare vnto vs whether the Greke Churche vsed the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Canon, to auoyde the prophanacion of the mystery? Who seeth not that the Counsell of Trent doth not this, that the people should vnderstand the way to theyr eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall saluation, whilest with toth and nayle they go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to retayne an vnknowen tongue in a sacred matter whiche pertayneth to the vniuersall Churche of Christ, whiche onely thyng were not to be suffred, thoughe all other things in the Canon, as touching the thing it selfe, were vpright. For Christ whome Paul also followed, commaunded that in the vse of the Eucharist we should shewe forth the Lordes death. And bycause the Byshops &amp; sacrificers for the most part are ignoraunt them selues of that thyng, the Counsell commaundeth that by other, somthing should be expounded out of the wicked Canon, not that the true Churche should therby be instructed, but that the impiety of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrifice should be confirmed. But I pray you what secret thing is ther in the Eucharist, which may not without danger be set forth in a tongue knowen <note place="margin">Ioan. 3.</note> to the vulgare people? This daunger will I open by the wordes of Christ: Euery one that doth euill thinges, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <note place="margin">Clerus whiche they turne cler gy signifieth a Lot, which Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter applieth to al Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. but Popish sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificers apply it vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues onely.</note> the light, neither co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the light, lest his workes should be reproued. And these deceauers seme herein not to haue done vnwisely. For so long as the Canon of the Masse was vnknowen vnto the common people, it was had in price and honour, but when Christian people (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Peter calleth the Clergy) perceaued this decease, they draue awaye the sacrificyng Priestes together with theyr sacrifice and Canon.</p>

But we neglecting this decree of the Counsell, let vs folowe the example of the primatiue Churche, in whiche the Churche Sacramentes of God, were celebrated in a tongue knowen vnto the common people.</p>
            <p>The xiii. decree is a lightening, going before the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and lightening of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> curse of the doctrine of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and teachers, which haue by the worde of God truly, perspicuously, and thoroughly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futed this pontificall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety of the Papistical Masse. By this decree therfore are abolished all bookes written and set abrode by al the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and learned men against the Papistical Masse, in which bookes is expressed the au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient doctrine of the Supper of the Lorde deliuered by Christ and the Apostles.</p>
            <p>But y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> these decrees being for the most part all of them vngodly, should haue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> more authoritie, &amp; should for euer be fyrme &amp; ratified, there are by the publicque authority of the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel published abrode brefe Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but yet such as are vtterly ful of vngodlynesse, striking w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a curse al those, that go about to reprehend the lest error of the Masse.</p>
            <p>Howbeit I wil not make any confutation of these Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, of which all and singular although briefly, yet suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently is spoken in the confutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the decrees: Of this thing only I thought good to admonish the godly reader, diligently to waighe these horrible curses of the Counsel, wherein the doctrine, and practise of Christe, of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and of the primatiue Church concerning the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Eucharist is horribly cursed.</p>
            <p>For vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those which thinke co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarily vnto their opinion, they geue not iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they should be borne withal as weake ones, but they geue sentence, that they are to be ac cursed downe vnto hell and to be deliuered vnto Sathan, which go about to derogate eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the least poynt of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisticall doctrine in this part.</p>
            <p>For all they are condemned and cursed euen as many as deny that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Masse the body of Christ is offred not to

            <p>And that al the faythfull may see, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the councell wil not relent, no not so much as in the lest of their rites, it curseth those also which affirme, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the words of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to be spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not with a soft voyce but w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> a loude voice, or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the masse ought to be celebrated in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vulgare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>onge, as if there were required to chaunge no impiety at al. For as much as the words of the supper are a part of the shewing forth of the Lords death, wil they also prohibite the shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> death of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> lord? But here lieth hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall impiety of consecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whiche they attribute not to the institution of Christ, but to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> magical pronunciatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of words, which if it were done in the vulgare tong, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might imitate.</p>
            <p>I thinke the godly reader doth now sufficiently vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, how much y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> decrees of this cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel of Trent are to be estemed, &amp; what is to be hoped for of it.

For it is most certayne, that euen as in the primatyue church many were sodenly drawen to martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, before they were baptised, whose saluation was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng letted, although they were not baptised with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: So also we can not denye eternall saluation vnto the faythfull which of nature abhorre from wyne, or by some other chaunce are taken away w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out the vse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Supper.</p>
                  <p>But of these cases we doe not nowe reason, but of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:19130:45"/>
the common and lawfull vse of the Supper of the Lord in a peaceable and quiet churche: whether it be necessarye by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of God to receaue both kindes or no. Here we expressedly affyrme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al the faithful of Christ are charged and bound to the vse of either part of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; the contemners of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Sacraments, at also depriued (as Augustine speaketh) of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Sacraments. For it is an expresse and manyfest commaundement of Christ, <hi>DRINKE YE,</hi> &amp; he addeth <hi>AL,</hi> namely they whiche eate the same also must drinke: This perspicuity the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell can by no meanes make darke, howsoeuer they turne themselues into all manner of formes like Proteus.</p>
                  <p>In the second Chapiter they say: that the Church hath power, (the substaunce of the Sacraments being saued) to ordaine &amp; alter, such thinges as it iudgeth most expediente for the variety of things, times and places: and therefore also hath it power to abrogate the cup.</p>
                  <p>Here I can not tell, whether the ignoraunce of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell be greater, or the impudencye. For what ignorance is this, that the substance of the Eucharist being saued, the vse of the cup may be abrogated? And is not wyne requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto the substance of the Sacramente of the Supper, whiche wine was of Christ ordayned to thys moste holy mysterie? The cup being abrogated, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> institution of Christ is not saued, but torne, changed, &amp; maimed. For wine is no lesse of the substance of thys Sacrament, than bread. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they winde themselues hereout by thys their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistication, that Christe is whole contayned vnder one kynde. For although Christ be not deuided, yet is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution to be kept, which being chaunged &amp; torne, there is made no distribution neither of the body nor yet of the bloud of Christ.</p>
                  <p>But the Canon is farre more horrible than thys doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: If any man shal saye that the holy Church, was not by iust causes and reasons led, that the Laye men shoulde

communicate vnder the forme of bread onlye, or that it hath therin erred, Let him be accursed.</p>
                  <p>But it shall be good in this place to recyte the reasons by whiche the Counsell of Constance thought good that the vse of the cup shoulde be abrogated, which reasons are so ridiculous and foolyshe, that it is wonderfull that in so greate an assembly of Doctors there was none, which for the defence of the authority of the church and of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel confuted them not.</p>
                  <p>And I wil not recite them in myne own wordes, but in the wordes of <hi>Gerson</hi> Chauncelour of <hi>Paris</hi> who was a man of no smal authority in the Counsel of <hi>Constance.</hi>

Wherefore many of them which were gathered together vpon thys matter, saye, that the custome of not communicating the Laitye vnder both kindes, chiefly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the faythfull haue bene so multiplyed, was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and reasonably brought in into the Church. And that for the auoyding of manifolde daungers, irreuerence and offence about the receauyng of such a blessed Sacrament. The fyrst daunger is in spillyng. The second in carying it from place to place. The thyrd for the filthinesse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, which ought to be sacred, and not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly to be ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and touched of the Laye men. And muche lesse ought y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wine consecrated to be sold at the Uinteners, as it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed with such men. The fourth by reason of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> long beards of the Lay men. The fyfth in preseruing it for the sicke, bycause it may being long in the vessell be turned to Uineger, &amp; so the bloud of Christ shoulde cease to be there, neyther should it be receaued, nor consecrated a new with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a masse: And if it might be possible that pure Uineger
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:19130:46"/>
should be geuen in steade of the bloud of Christ, yet there is an other danger, bycause in the sommer wormes &amp; flyes would engender, howe close so euer the vessell were shut: sometimes also it would putrifie, &amp; be made as it were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable to drike, &amp; this is a reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of very great efficacy.

And it is demaunded in what vessell so much wyne should be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrated, as should serue at Easter for x. or xx. thousand persons: The sixt daunger should be in the cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynesse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wyne, at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> least in many places, where is scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely founde wyne ynough to celebrate, and in some places also, it is very deare.

                     <q>First that the dignitie of the Laymen touchyng the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing of the body of Christ, shuld be as great as the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Priestes. Secondly that so to do, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>uer hath ben and is continually of necessitie. And so all they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thinke, do, or teache otherwyse haue perished and do perishe. And in generall all as well the Clergy, as teachers and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, whiche haue not to their power resisted suche a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, by wordes wrttinges and sentences, and that they peruerted the holy Scripture. Thirdly that the vertue of this Sacrament is not more principally in the consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than in the receauing. Fourthly that the Churche of Rome iudgeth not ryghtly of the Sacramentes, neither should it in this be imitated. Fiftly that generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, and specially the Counsel of Constance erred in faith and good maners. Sixtly it should be many wayes an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of Seditions and Schismes, in our Christianty, as experience now manifestly declareth in Bohemia, whiche sedition tendeth to the dissipation not onely of the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualty but also of the temporalty, vnlesse the prouidence of God, &amp; the prudence of the king of the Romanes should prouide and order thynges.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>HOwbeit so long as it was so receaued of the Layme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Churche so commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding or permitting or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seling, it was well done, as also when the Priests did consecrate in leuened bread.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But now for so much as vppon certayne considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a contrary custome hath growen in vre praysed and commaunded by the Churche, which commaundement is apparant by such a custome, which is the best interpreter of lawes: Such a receauing therfore is rashe, &amp; presu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, offensiue, seditious, &amp; a disturbing of Ecclesiastical or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <note place="margin">Note y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hor rible blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy.</note> &amp; consequently induring eternal damnation. Neither is that of any force, when they affirme, that the Laymen deserue more in receauing vnder both kindes, than vnder the forme of bread only. We aunswere it is false, bycause obedience is better than sacrifice, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But for the simples sake let vs examine all these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons by the rule of Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fayth and heauenly doctrine: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may se y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are not only partly ridiculous &amp; foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe, but also partly blasphemous, &amp; horrible to be heard.</p>
               <p>First they feare the effusion or shedyng of the bloud of Christ, if it should be ministred in the cup, or be caryed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> place to place. But this superstition sprang of the fayned lye of transsubstantion, which they haue taught contrary to the nature and definition of this Sacrament, namely that the substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the wyne is changed and turned into the bloud of Christ: whiche thing the Apostle testifieth to be false: For he calleth bread <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Sanguinis Christi</hi> that is, the communicating of the bloud of Christ, and that with the bread and wyne the body and bloud of Christ are exhibited, For euen as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of Christ can not be torne with teth, no more also can his bloud be shed: It is a thing spirituall &amp; celestiall, not of this world,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:19130:47"/>
but of an other world. Wherfore this daunger of sheding is not to be feared, as well in the dispensing of it, as in the carying it from place to place.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The third reason is vtterly contumelious agaynst the holy Churche of Christ, namely lest the vessels being tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lips of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Layme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should be made filthy, which ought to be holy, and not filthy.</q> What do the mouthes of the Laymen clensed and sanctified by the bloud of Christ, seme stil vncleane and filthy, or are the mouthes of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificers, purged with the kisses of their harlots puret tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mouthes of the Laymen? And if it were but by this thing only, al Christian Princes and kynges may gather, in what estimation the sacrificers haue them.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The fourth cause why the cup is denyed &amp; abrogated is bycause of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> long beards of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Laymen, vnto which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloud of Christ may happe to cleane.</q> If this be a sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t reason &amp; of efficacy, why are wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> debarred, which want beards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And also as touching me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which haue beardes, were it not better they shuld shaue their beards, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ shuld be cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged, &amp; his testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; last will violated.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The fifth reason is vtterly vngodly which is le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>t perad <note place="margin">Christ hys bloud tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into Uineger.</note> uenture it shuld be turned into vineger, if it shuld be reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sicke ones.</q> Oh thing most wicked. Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloud of Christ be turned into vineger? But (say they) the wyne &amp; not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloud of Christ is turned into vineger. But they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not say so. For the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being done, they affirme, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wyne is changed &amp; turned into the bloud of Christ, which mutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they by a new name cal transsubsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wher fore if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of transsubsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion be true the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bloud of Christ and substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce therof is made vineger. But y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bloud be farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, which can so easely (specially in so great a carelesnesse of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sacrificers) be turned into vineger. It is maruayle y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the good holy fathers of the Papacy are not ashamed of so foolishe and vngodly reasons, whiche they most manifestly oppose agaynst the institution of Christ, to defende their sacriledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:19130:48"/>
Gerson addeth a greater daunger. <q>Sometymes also (sayeth he) it would putrifye and be made as it were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable to drinke, and this reason (sayth he) is of very great efficacy. Howe contumelious by this reason are the sacrificers agaynst the bloud of Christ?</q> For they speake of the cup beyng consecrated, and so dare affirme that the bloude of Christe may putrifye. If our men should inuent the lyke thynges, what thunders of ercommunications would they not laye vpon them. But they themselues for <note place="margin">Christe his bloud pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifyed.</note> that they be a nation holy, and a kyngly priesthode, handle at their pleasure their newe GOD fabricated of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce of bread and wyne.</p>
               <p>But the reason which is brought as touching wormes and flyes, whiche they affirme may in the sommer time be engendred in the vessel, how close so euer it be shut, in my iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it semeth rather to confirme vnto the Papistes the vse of the cup than to abrogate it. For for so muche as the bloud of Christ newly created of the substaunce of the wyne is lyuely, they may by the flyes and wormes whiche are engendred of it proue the veritie thereof. But awaye with this impiety. For in a thing of so great and enorme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blasphemy, I dare not cal it folly, whiche dare ascribe so absurde thynges vnto the bloud of Christe: I knowe howe they go aboute to wynd themselues out, but they can not: For wormes vndoubtedly can not be engendred of accidentes, that is, of figure, colour and sauor, but they must nedes come of some substaunce and matter. But by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secration they affirme that there remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth no substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the wyne but that it is altogether co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted into the substaunce of the bloud of Christ, they blas phemously here among the daungers of the reseruation of the cup alledge that of the substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the bloud of Christ beyng putrifyed come wormes and flyes. And this putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction (sayeth Gerson) happeneth so much the sooner, if many other haue dronke before, namely, bycause of the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:19130:48"/>
touchyng of the skyn and fleshe of man.</p>
               <p>But graunt that these daungers myght happen, if the bloude hallowed in the cup shoulde be reserued for the sicke, by what testimony of the Scripture will they proue that the cup halowed for the sicke ought to be reserued for certayne dayes or wekès? Christ sayde vnto his disciples, drinke ye all of this, and strayght waye all of them dranke as also did the Corinthians. If to establishe their sacrifice <note place="margin">Math. 26. 1. Cor. 11.</note> they vse the Paschall Lambe, why do they not vse the same also agaynste these daungers, where it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, that nothyng should be reserued agaynste the nexte daye. It is a thyng most certayne, that breade and <note place="margin">Exod. 12</note> wyne without the vse haue not the nature of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therfore the daungers whiche are here rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of Gerson are vayne and contumelious agaynste the bloud of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is a wytty reason I promise you, whiche they bryng co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the largenesse &amp; greatenesse of the cup, in which at Easter the bloud of Christ myght be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrated to serue xx. thousand men.

There is much spoken of the greatnesse of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> bell at Erdford, they may take that for this purpose.</q> Who can here holde him selfe from laughing, vnlesse this blyndnesse were more to be lamented with teares than to be laughed at. There af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled together (sayth Gerson) out of the highe vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Paris, &amp; out of other places, most excellent diuines &amp; that in great number and of great worthynesse, of whome these reasons are allowed. The miserable sacrificers are still bewitched with theyr Magicall inchantement, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they haue persuaded the worlde that they can by brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng the wordes of Christe vpon the breade and wyne, conuert the substaunce of the bread and wyne into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud of Christ, beyng ignoraunt of the true man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of consecratyng, whose power consisteth in the fyrste institution of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Churche is admonished &amp; redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

               <p>
                  <q>In the sixth daunger they haue a consideration of the poore. For, for that in many places groweth no wine, and if it should be bought, it would cost a great price, the good holy fathers thinke it better, vtterly to abrogate &amp; denye the vse of the cup vnto the lay men, than to put them to so great charges.</q> I will not stande aboute the confutyng of thys folyshnesse, at which, vnlesse a man be out of his wits he can not but laugh.</p>

               <p>Here the spirit of the holy Sorbonical fathers openeth it selfe. Least they should altogether seme to haue erred, &amp; to haue peruerted the holy scripture, they iudge notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the precept and institution of Christ, that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is to be retayned vnder one kynd only. Thys on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they laboure for, the Papistes will not seme to haue er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, no not in the least thing, as I haue alredy often shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But what is more manifest, what more plaine, what more bryght, what more perspicuous, than that Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted the last supper vnder both kindes? Likewyse also what is more manifest, what more playne and palpable, than that the papistes haue torne in peces thys instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ: they haue with folyshe vngodly and wicked reasons violated the last will of Christ, they haue in thys part peruerted the holy Scripture? Who is so rude and so vnskilfull in the holy Scriptures that he vnderstandeth not these thynges? It lotheth me to rehearse the reast of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> reasons, but bycause I haue once taken it in hand, I will yet take a litle more paines therin.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>If it were of necessitie to do thys, sayth Gerson, then al they that teache and do otherwyse haue peryshed. When there is mention made of our Elders whiche haue lyned</q>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:19130:50"/>
vnder this Babilonical captiuitye, I alwaies remember that saying of Christ, when he prophecieth of the false pro <note place="margin">Math. 24.</note> phetes whiche shoulde come in the last tymes. They shall geue (saith he) great signes and wonders, so that if it were possible euen the very elect should be brought into errour. Whereby I alwayes gather, that God wyll alwayes pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish those that teach peruerse thinges. In the meane tyme God hath at al tymes wonderfully reserued vnto him self his elect, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> they should not bow their knees before Baal, <note place="margin">1. Reg. 19. 1. Cor. 3. Ephe. 2.</note> and are saued, as it were by fyre, vnto whom God also hath forgeuen manye faultes and infirmities, which haue built vpon the onely foundation Christ. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Unto their Iudge therfore let vs leaue our elders, and with a thankefull minde let vs receaue so great a light, let vs returne vnto the institution of Christe and praye wyth Daniel: To vs be confusion of face, to our Kinges, to our <note place="margin">Dan. ix.</note> Princes, and to our fathers, which haue synned.

               <p>
                  <q>Thirdly (saith Gerson) it should followe, that the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this Sacrament should not be more principal in the consecration than in the receauing.</q> Gerson taketh that as a thing graunted, which is not true. For, for so muche as the Sacraments when they are vsed are of force, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les they be vsed, they haue not the nature of a Sacrament, and therfore vnles there be a receauing, consecration is of no efficacy, so that consecration is for the receauing, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto it is appointed.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Fourthly, that the Church of Rome shoulde not thinke rightly of the sacraments, and should not in this be imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</q> Here my Gerson thou hast hit the nayle of the head. A great daunger vndoubtedly might hereby be at hand vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:19130:51"/>
the Church of Rome, if it be proued so grosselye to haue erred in this sacrament, who would not doubt but it hath also erred in many other things? Which thing hath beene already oftentimes declared vnto you of the Paparye in a maner in al &amp; the principall articles of christian religion.</p>
               <p>Wherfore forasmuche as these good holy fathers, wyll not seme so much as to haue erred, so far is it of, that they haue any care for the taking awaye of errours: It is most safe for godly men to rest in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> simple truth &amp; most certain institution of Christ: the church of Rome is by no meanes to be imitated, which doth not onely corrupt y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, but also the whole doctrine of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Fiftly, that general Counsels, &amp; specially the counsel of Constance haue erred in fayth &amp; good maners.</q> This is no bringing in of a false belief, but a most certain &amp; infallible truth, that the counsels of Constance &amp; Trent haue not on ly erred in faith, but also haue with a sacrilegious audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty condemned the doctrine declared of Christ, as diuelysh, as it is before shewed in the confutation of the Canons. Wherefore ther is no cause why ye should any more exti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate their authority, which in the myndes of manye (the truth of the Gospel being reuealed) is fallen away. Bring ye forth a text of the scripture: for the faithful wil not any more be satisfied with your Miters.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Sixtly: it should be an occasion of seditions and sectes in our christianity. </q>It is an old fable, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the Woulf troubling the water, laieth the fault vpon the shepe. Who is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this schisme, but ye you Papists by this your sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? Why haue ye changed the institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ? For if this had continued inuiolate, ther shoulde haue bene no schisme in the Churche as touching this thing. But nowe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the church requireth his right, it is answered of these good holy ones that she is seditious and schismatical.</p>
               <p>Al the godly know how to beware of sedition, &amp; to geue
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:19130:51"/>
vnto the Magistrate a due reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. But ye for so much as ye ar not Magistrates, as it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: But ye ar not so. &amp;c. <note place="margin">Luke. 22.</note> If the Magistrate being mindful of his office, do defende y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> priuelege &amp; ryght of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> church deliuered of Christ, he is by no meanes seditious, but godly, &amp; doth his duty, which if he neglect to do, the lord his god wil punish him, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Deut. But now let vs at the length brieflye heare, <note place="margin">Deut. 7.</note> what the Counsel of Constance doth finallye iudge of the vse of the cup. <q>In such strife (saith Gerson) may a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> easly se (vnles it be such as wil willingly be malepeart, or by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> frowardly erre) that the receiuing of the sacrament vnder both kindes, of the laymen, is not now neither at a ny time hath bene by the necessity of the commaundement of the law of God vnder the payne of eternall damnation. Howbeit so long as the laymen did it, the Churche so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding it, or permitting it, or counseling it, it was wel done, as when the priests did consecrate in leuened bread.

               <p>
                  <q>Of these reasons soundeth the second Canon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of Trent, wher it saith: If any man shal say that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly catholike Churche was not by iust causes and reasons led, that the laimen &amp; also the Clergy which celebrate not, should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate vnder the forme of bread onelye, or that it therin erred: let him be accursed.</q> Thou seest christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that by the authority of the Counsel of Trent, reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that are foolish, blasphemous, &amp; contumelious agaynst the Churche of God, are counted and allowed for iust causes, which if any man shal gainsay, let him be accursed.</p>
               <p>Many haue hitherto doubted, certaine also haue vtterlye denied that the Counsell of Trent is ruled &amp; gouerned by the holy ghost. But I do not onely nothing doubt thereof, but am fulli persuaded y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel asse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled vnder <hi>Pius</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>. 4 B. of Rome, is not at al gouerned or ruled by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy gost.</p>

not beleued the truth, but haue consented vnto iniquitye.</p>
               <p>And thys grosse ignorance &amp; blasphemy of the counsel is so directed of the lord, that it profiteth the Church of God. For al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true faithful do now not only se, but also eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fele with their hands, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the fathers of the counsel ar deliuered <note place="margin">Roma. 1. Thessa. 1.</note> vp into a reprobate minde, &amp; that they defend most grosse &amp; palpable errors, &amp; tread vnder foote the manifest truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>In the third Canon is confyrmed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> self same sacrilege &amp; manifest idolatry: that vnder the paine of a curse we must beleue that whole Christ is receaued vnder one kind one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But how can the faithful beleue this, when as it wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the woord of promise?</q> For faith leaneth vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God: but ther was neuer any word of God that Christe would in the bread only dispense his body &amp; blood, there is no wher such thing extant in the Euangelicall historye or writing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles. These subtilties as touching christ y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is not deuided, ar of no force. We know that &amp; fyrmly beleue it. But here the question is not of the integritye of Christ, but of the dispe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sation of his body &amp; blood. He recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the cup said: <hi>Drinke ye al of this, this is my blood. &amp;c.</hi> This cup being abrogated, how canst thou w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> a true faith settle thy self, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> in the vse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread thou art made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of his blood? For when he toke the bread, he said not, this is my blood, or eate ye my blood. How subtile soeuer this impiety be, yet can they neuer defende &amp; support thys sacriledge.</p>
               <p>In the. 4. canon they deale very hardly with the holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp; especially w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Cyprian</hi> &amp; <hi>Augustine,</hi> &amp; also with the church y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was at that time, wherin was accustomed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to infants also of Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s the <hi>Eucharist</hi> was geuen. But although we also disalowe this custome, neither thinke it mete to be called again into the church, yet iudge we y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the holye Fathers ought more gentlye to be delt with in this matter. But farre bee it from me that I shoulde prescribe
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:19130:53"/>
any thing to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spirite of this counsell, which seing it hath vpon iust causes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed this sacrilege in this sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, it shall also vndoubtedly if God will haue most wayghtye &amp; most iust reasons of this curse, which reasons to resyst is to sin against the holy ghost.</p>
               <p>To these four canons they adde other two articles: whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for any cause or consideration the vse of the cup is to be permitted vnto any man. Also: whether that for certain honest reasons &amp; such which agree with Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> charity, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vse of the cup is to be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to any nation or kingdom, vnder certayn conditions, &amp; what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions they are.

Luther (a man of godlye memorye) bicause he wrote, that if the Counsell woulde graunt bothe kindes, hee woulde vse but one kinde onelye. But it was the farthest thyng from his thought to haue the institution of Christ abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t deuided in halfes. But his meanyng was to haue the Churche admonished of the sacrilegious holdnes of the Papistes, and that it shoulde not vse bothe kindes, bicause of the decree of the Counsel, but bicause of the institution of Christ. For it lieth not in the arbitreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Counsel, Church, or anye other man to abrogate or graunt the cup, being of Christ not onelye graunted vnto his Church, but also bidden and commaunded.

vnto certaine nations vpon the conditions vnder written, either libertye for Ordinaries of places to graunt it them, and moreouer where oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty serueth to be dispensed with them.</p>
               <p>The holy Synode as a godly mother desiring healthfully (as muche as is graunted in the lord) to foresee for the saluation of all men, knowyng yet that it selfe can not presently with safetye vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlye absolue and define suche a matter, but the thing being first diligently vewed and examined and all things maturely considered, it hath at the length thus decreed: That our most holy Lorde, such knowledge of the cause had, which shal seme good to his Blessednes, maye graunt vnto those Nations and peoples, vnto which his holynesse shal thinke to be commodious and profitable, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the conditions vnder written (or also vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which the holi ghost shal minister vnto him, and if it shall seeme meete vnto hys holynes, also at the request, counsell, and approbation of thys holy Synode) the aboue sayde vse of the cup, and maye graunt also the power required, and maye moreouer also mercyfullye and according to hys Apostolical benignity dispense with them.</p>

               <p>But for as muche as both these or either of them can not come to passe without the consent of the Byshop of Rome, the holy fathers of the Counsell haue deliberated of certayne conditions, vpon whiche the Byshop of Rome maye dispense with certayne nations for the vse of the Cup. All the wordes of this decree are diligently to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued. For they are very ware, lest they shoulde seme to be Authors of this alteration, so great and hainous an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is it, to communicate vnder both kyndes accordyng vnto the institution of Christ.

no nede at all of the Popes dispensation, bycause Christe hath not onely graunted vnto hys Churche, but also se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely hydden and commaunded, Drinke ye all (sayth he) of thys. <hi>Math.</hi> 26. For euen as he hath not commaunded to drynke hys body, so also hath he not commaunded to eate hys bloud. Neither is it any lesse absurde to eate the bloud of Christe, than to drynke the body of Christe. For by distinct Symboles Christe would erhibite these giftes of hys body and hys bloud. But let vs see the conditions, whereupon the Counsell of Trent decreeth that the vse of the Cup maye be graunted vnto the Laymen, whiche conditions are not onely vniust, but also vtterly vngodly and to be detested.</p>
               <p>Firste: That they whiche wyll communicate vnder both kyndes are compelled to bynde them selues vnto all Papisticall Idolatrye, as well in thys parte as in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther partes of doctrine, and religiously to admitte and obserue the decrees both those that are alredy published and also those that shallbe published by the Counsell of Trent. But who can number vp all the Idolatryes, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall inchauntementes, superstitions, and traditions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant vnto the worde of GOD, whiche haue nowe many yeares bene vsed in the Papacy, with all whiche the myndes of the Godly shoulde be wrapped? Farther howe greate a daunger is ioyned vnto thys, for a man to subdue hym selfe not onely to the vngodly decrees of this Counsell whiche are alredy published abrode, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so vnto them whiche shalbe hereafter publyshed abrode<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What if the Counsell shoulde decree that GOD is not God? Shoulde it therefore be beleued and obserued? But some Papiste wyll saye, we nede not to feare any suche thyng, or to looke for any of these thinges from so sacred a Counsell, whiche is gouerned by the holy Ghost. But I thynke I haue declared more bryghtlye than the noone
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:19130:56"/>
daye by the decrees of this Counsell, that the fathers as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled together at Trent with their Romishe Bishop, go aboute nothyng els than the oppression of sound doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and the renewyng of Idolatrye and all kynde of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions? What true godlyman therefore can receaue thys condition?</p>
               <p>The second condition is playnely repugnant vnto the requeste that was made: namely that they whiche wil communicate vnder both kyndes shoulde beleue and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that the communion vnder one kynde onely is god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they whiche beleue this, wyll neuer desire the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion vnder both kyndes: but rather thys is the onely, cause, why they shoulde eschewe the communion vnder one kynde onely, bycause it is repugnant vnto the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and institution of Christe, and shoulde iudge the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome and lawe brought in contrary to the institution of Christe a pernicious and detestable error. In prescrybyng thys condition, what other thyng doth the Counsell, than dally and mocke with the whole Christen worlde, when as they knowe that none of the godly will euer vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon these conditions communicate vnder both kyndes.</p>
               <p>The thyrde condition is, that they whiche will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate vnder both kyndes, muste acknowledge the Byshoppe of Rome for Christe his Uicare, and muste as faythfull chyldren geue vnto hym all reuerence. And what thyng elles were thys, than to denye Christe. For in the wrytynges of the Apostle it is manifestly shewed, <note place="margin">2. Thes. 2</note> that the Byshoppe of Rome is the Antichrist, whiche shall syt in the Temple of God, and peruert all the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyppyng of God. And what punishement is to be looked <note place="margin">Math. 10.</note> for of suche as denye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the truth of the Gospell, Christe teacheth. He whiche wyll denye me before men, I also wyll denye hym before my heauenly father. Let them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone <note place="margin">Math. 15.</note> (sayeth he in an other place) for they are blynde and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:19130:56"/>
leaders of the blynde.</p>
               <p>The same yoke is layde vpon the faythfull in the iiii. condition. For, for so muche as the Archebyshoppes, By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Prelates, and Priestes, are all addicted, and by an othe bounde vnto the Byshoppe of Rome, they will not suffer any thyng to be brought in, that is repugnant vnto the Pontificall impiety.</p>
               <p>In the fifth condition they whiche wyll communicate vnder both kyndes are bounde vnto auricular Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, whiche was the vngodly and miserable slaughter house of afflicted co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sciences, whereby the adherents of the Byshoppe of Rome may easely searche out the thoughts of all men, and defend theyr tyranny. But for so much as thys is a meere humane tradition, neyther commaunded of Christe, nor yet deliuered of the Apostles, as it is in an other place aboundantly shewed, this condition wyll no lesse feare awaye the faythfull that are euery where dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed in the Papacy from the Communion vnder both kyndes, than the former foure.</p>
               <p>The laste condition pertayneth vnto the Sacrificers, that in the administration of the bloude there shoulde be committed no sacrilege or prophanation. And thys in a manner was the principall reason, why in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of Constance the vse of the Cup was abrogated: but the reasons are so ridiculous, that I am ashamed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse them. The holy fathers forsoth were afrayed, lest peraduenture the bloude of Christe shoulde be spilte vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the earth, or lest it shoulde cleaue vnto the beardes of men, or kerchtefes of women, or els shoulde be turned into Uineger. The cause of thys feare is the ignoraunce of the mystery, sprong of the fayned inuention of trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation. For the bloude of Christe whiche is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed in the Supper, can not be spylte, as they thynke, when as without vse it is not a Sacrament. And Christe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:19130:57"/>
accordynge to hys wysedome could haue fore seene all these daungers, of whiche the Churche ought to haue bene admonished. But Christe hauyng no respect at all vnto these thynges wylled, that not onely Byshops and <note place="margin">Math. xxvi. Mark. xiiii. Luke. xxii, 1.

               <p>These are the conditions, vpon whiche the Counsell of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rent iudgeth that certayne nations maye be dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed withall in the vse of the Cup. Whiche conditions are suche, that none that is good and godly can receaue them without denyall of our Lord Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>And although all the good and godly ought worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be grieued at so greate an iniquitie of the Counsell, yet ought Kynges and Princes moste of al, diligently to looke vnto it, whiche are as Gods made rulers ouer the people of GOD, to defende the true worshyppynge of GOD, of whiche they ought no lesse to be kepers than of the seconde Table. For all Christendome seeth nowe that the Byshoppe of Rome together with the Counsell of Trent do but mocke and dally with Kynges and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whiche graunte a thyng so manifest, and so humbly desyred by the Orators of Kynges and Princes vpon such conditions, whiche they knowe to be moste wicked and vngodly. For what is in the Gospell more bryght and more manifest, than that Christe instituted hys Supper vnder both kyndes? and that the Churche of the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians communicated vnder both kyndes? And if the Counsell woulde haue done wysely, it had bene more meete for their authoritie and person, simply and vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to denye the Communion required, than to dispense with it vpon suche conditions, whiche they them selues
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:19130:57"/>
ues vnderstande to bee repugnaunte vnto the thynge required.</p>
               <p>Let al the true Godly also and faythfull which are eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where dispersed through out the world, consider, howe litle regarde, yea rather none at all is had to theyr salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if the vse of the cup be graunted vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon these conditions, whereby they are compelled to approue and confyrme all papisticall impietye. But rather it is muche better for euer to abstayne not onely from the Cuppe but also from the bread of the Supper, than with so greate offence to God, by theyr testimonye to allowe horrible Idolatrye and sacrilege. For by it they are not graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the libertie wherinto they are deliuered by Christ, but are caste into a greater bondage, the conscience is not eased, but oppressed with a greater burden,</p>
               <p>I truste I haue briefelye and perspicuouslye shewed that the Counsell of Trent hath not onely allowed er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roures that are repugnaunte vnto the holy Scripture, but hath also confyrmed horrible impietie, Iolatrye, superstitions, and abuses, and that not in doctrine alone, but also in the Sacramente deliuered of Christ vnto the Churche. Euen as therefore for theyr sakes we haue muche cause to lamente, for that the Fathers of thys Counsell in so manifeste a lyghte of the Gospell are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with so greate a blyndnesse, that they will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge or abolyshe no not euen the leaste erroure: so also agayne on the other syde oughte the Churche of GOD and all we euen from the hearte to reioyce, that euen nowe at the laste by the decrees of thys Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, we maye stay vppon some certainety of the will and meanyng of the pontificall Counselles. For hytherto, the Christians which are euery where dispersed abroade in the papacye, haue hoped y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it would haue come

For thys of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice they thought to pertayne unto a counsel &amp; not to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men. Neither also thought they it the office of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate to chaunge or abolysh any thing in doctrine or ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall ceremonyes. Whiche thyng for that many Kings and Princes, Earles, Barons, Noble me and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall cities haue done; very many were offended, bicause they taryed not for some lawfull knowledge of the cause and determination of a Counsel. They confesse that they acknowledge that in the Catholyke Churche (as they call it) are very many errors, but they affyrme ther withal that it pertayneth not to the Magistrate to take them awaye, but that office belongeth vnto a Counsell. And whereas many yeares and long tyme, a Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, generall and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

For as be in Terence sayth <hi>Nulla circuitione vsum est, rem aperte prolocutum est,</hi> that is, It hath vsed no circu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So farre is it of that they thynke to abrogate and take awaye manifest Idolatrye, Sacrifice for the quicke and the dead, Carying aboute and worshipping of the breade, Inuocation of Saints, pilgrimages to the Images of the dead, Doctrine of perpetuall doubting, Doctrine of the merite of good workes, Of purgatory and such lyke errors.</p>
               <p>Nowe also shoulde we speake somewhat of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of manuers, whiche shoulde bee taken in hande

and defyned by the Counsell, whiche thyng the Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadoures and Legates of the Emperoure, of the Frenche Kyng, and of other Princes requyred moste earenestly. For not onely the Courte of Rome aboundeth with all kinde of vices and wickednesse, as Ryot, Simonye, Aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice or couetousnesse, and moste horrible fylthinesse, but thys mischiefe is so farre and wyde spred abroade through oute Christendome, that the Embassadoures and Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of certayne Princes were not ashamed to declare vnto the Counsell, that the fylthinesse of the priestes in theyr prouinces was so greate, that amongest a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth priestes coulde scarcely bee founde two, whose helpe and industrye they myghte with honestye vse in any ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile rusticall iudgementes; so farre are they paste <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But if we diligentlye weyghe the requestes of the Kynges and Princes, we oughte euen from the bottome of the harte to lamente that in the Councell sit not suche Fathers, whiche should be affected which the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of these thynges.

Wherefore they vrge and requyre a reformation with as muche fayth &amp; diligence as they can.</p>
               <p>But what doo they of the Papacye and the good holy Counsell of Trent? They dooe euen as if a man shoulde

               <p>Knowe ye that thys admonition pertayneth vnto you, vpon whome ye haue turned all the eyes of whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome. For euen as the Lorde made a league with the tribe of Leuy, whose office was to kepe knowledge, that beyng demaunded concernyng the will of GOD, they shoulde aunswere and instructe the people of GOD:
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:19130:65"/>
So also woulde he haue the Byshoppes to be diligent ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the Apostolicall doctrine, and to be successors vnto the Apostles, not so much in seate as in doctrine. But alas that thyng hath happened in our tymes, and in the tymes of oure Elders, which the Prophet complayned of concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the priestes of hys tyme. For in steade of knowledge and the lawe of God, are kept humane traditions whiche are repugnaunte vnto the lawe and will of God. Ye haue departed from the way of the Lorde, and haue bene an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence vnto many in the lawe of the Lord, which haue em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced these doctrines. Christ sayd vnto the man that was <note place="margin">Math. ix.</note> sicke of the palsey. Haue confidence my sonne, thy sunnes are forgeuen thee: But contrarily ye Fathers of the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The Apostle sayth. <note place="margin">Rom. viii.</note> The holy ghost beareth witnesse vnto our spirite, that we are the children of God.

But who can recken vp all the thinges, in whiche ye papistical priests haue departed from the law of the Lord? This also was the cause why the Prophet sayde in thys place: I haue made you to be despised &amp; vile to all people bicause ye haue not intended in your hart to geue glory to God. Therfore also is your glory troden vnder foote, as in an other place the Lorde of hostes speaketh vnto Eli the priest: Whosoeuer shall glorifye me, I will glorifye hym, but they which contemne me shal be made vile.

Inipute this contempt vnto your selues: your owne sinne is the cause thereof, for that ye haue forsaken the law of the Lord, and haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the way of the Lord. Your manners are not in thys place reprehended, whiche are not agreable vnto the dignitye of a priest. Here is chiefely entreated of the true worshipping of God, whiche ye haue corrupted, and contaminated, and therefore also accordyng to this oure Prophet, all your sacrifyces are contaminated, and ye are
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:19130:66"/>
in very dede made vile vnto all men.</p>
               <p>Neyther can I beleue, that all you, whiche are assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together at Trent are a lyke so vtterly ignoraunte of the holy Scriptures, that ye vnderstand not these thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Wherfore the greater daunger and greuouser punish ment of God is to be loked for, if agaynst your conscience ye condemne the manifest truth.</p>
               <p>But rather if ye desyre to mayntayne your name, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and dignity, returne vnto the couenaunt and law of the Lord, that is to the doctrine of the Prophets, of Christ and of the Apostels, see that ye embrace it, casting awaye the inuentions of humane traditions. Seeke the glorye of the Lorde, eudeuour your selues to extoll hys name and honour, and hee wyll on the other syde glorifye you, and (which thyng ye only desyre) wyl subdue the whole world vnto your ministery. And ye shall bee no more a reproche vnto all your neyghbours. Neyther thynke ye it to bee a shame, to acknowledge an errour.</p>
               <p>The Priestes of the olde Testament also were bewyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched wyth thys opinion, who sayd: We are wyse, and the lawe of the Lorde is wyth vs. Unto whom the Prophet speaketh: Put ye no confidence in the woordes of lying, saying: The temple of the Lorde, the temple of the Lorde. <note place="margin">Ierem. 8.

Come sayd they, and let vs imagine some deuise agaynste Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: <note place="margin">Ierem. 18.</note> for the law shall not perysh from the Priest, nor coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel from the wyse man, nor the woorde from the Prophet: come and let vs smyte hym wyth the toung, and let vs not geue heede to any of his woordes. Let not such thoughtes for Gods sake, possesse your myndes, that ye should harden

your hartes against the woord of God, being falselye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that the law can not perishe from the Priest, that <note place="margin">Psal. 94.</note> is, that ye cannot erre.</p>
               <p>For I suppose that by this short admonition ye maye vnderstand that the lawe is perished from the Priest, and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> horryble errours are brought in into the Church of God by your Prophetes, that is, by your interpreters of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly scripture. Whych errours if ye haue determined wyth to othe and nayle styll to retayne, and if ye wyll not geue heede vnto al the woordes of the Prophetes and of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postels, then knowe ye, that accordyng to the example of these Priestes, your destruction is at hande, vnto whom God threatened perdition.

Counsell of Trent concerning the principall pointes of doctrine, Sacramentes, and reformation of the Clergy, in which decrees is condemned the true doctrine of Original synne, of the strengthes of free wyll, of grace and iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of faith and woorkes, of the sacramentes, and special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> and Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion vnder both kyndes: ther is no prouision made for meete Ministers for Churches, but vngodlye decrees are confirmed, wherein againste the woord of God is prohibited the mariage of Priestes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure sole lyfe is obtruded, and the church and the court of Rome are made free from al errour: and it is prouided for the bishop of Rome by the selfe same Canons being repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that no man shoulde presume once to reprehende hys errours, much lesse to correcte and amende them.</p>
               <p>By all which thinges as well our men, which haue of late departed from the papisticall court, as also euen they which are styll addicted vnto the papistical religion, maye vnderstand, that there can nothing bee hoped for of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistical Counsels, that may serue for the taking awaye of superstitions, errours and abuses out of the Churche, and for the reformation of the maners of the Clergy.</p>
               <p>But forasmuche as by all mens iudgement, the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of doctrine and maners is most necessarye, and the same ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by no meanes be obtained of the bishop of Romes counsel (who least they should seme to haue erred, wyl not geue place euen in the least thing) it is nedeful that kinges and Princes do deuise some other waye and meanes to set an vnity in religion, if in case they wyll prouide for theyr own saluation, and the saluation of their subiectes.
