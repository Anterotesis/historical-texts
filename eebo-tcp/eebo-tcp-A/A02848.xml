            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of children: education of children: acquisition of things which pertaine to no man: equall libertie of all: to communicate commodities: to repell force: to hurt no man</hi>: and generally, <hi>to do to another as he would be done vnto</hi>: which is the sum and substance of the second table of the decalogue. And this lawe <hi>Thom. Aquine</hi>

            <p>But because this light of nature, in many men is exceeding dimme; the next rule is to obserue what hath bin allowed by those who are of greatest both wisedome and integrity, in whom nature doth shew her selfe most cleere.

The next place is to be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the authors of the ciuill lawe; whose iudgement hath bin these many hundred yeers, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired by many, approoued by all, and is at this daie accepted for lawe, almost in all states of the christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:4088:9"/>
common wealth. To these also we may adioyne, as attendants, their interpreters of most approued note. The third place is due to Philosophers, histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers, orators and the like; who haue not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably endeauoured to free nature of two cloudes, wherewith shee is often ouercast: grosse ignorance, and subtill errour.</p>
            <p>But because naturall reason, as <hi>Alciate</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">5. consil. 38.</note> affirmeth, doth sometimes varie, according to the capacitie of particulare men; euen as the sunne, beeing in it selfe alwaies the same, giueth neither heate nor light to all alike: the third rule followeth, to obserue the common vse of all nations, which <hi>Cicero</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">ipsius vocem naturae de natur. deot.</note>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth; <hi>the voice of nature</hi>: because as <hi>Aristotle</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">15. prob. 3.</note>hath writ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten, <hi>it is not done by chance which euery where is done. Plato</hi>

            <p>Now then your first position is so cleerelie true, that you doe but guild gould in labouring to prooue it: for <hi>man</hi> is not onely sociable by nature, but (as <hi>Aristotle</hi>

It is not necessarie to haue so large a consent of nations, as I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before: and it is false that in all times and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions there haue beene magistrates. After the deluge, magistrates were not knowne vntil kings did arise, as hereafter it shall appeare. The Iewes were often without either magistrates or gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Whereupon in certaine places of the booke of Iudges<note n="z" place="margin">ca. 17. ver. 6. &amp; ca. vlt in si.</note>it is thus written: <hi>In those dayes there was no king in Israell, but what seemed right to euery man that did hee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes <hi>Democraticall</hi> gouernement doth drawe to a pure <hi>anarchie</hi>; and so doth the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terregnum</hi> of electiue principalities. <hi>Leo Aser</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, that in <hi>Guzala,</hi> a countrie of Africke, the people haue neither king nor forme of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement; but vpon dayes of mart, they elect a captaine to secure their trafficke. The same authour deliuereth, that the inhabitantes of the mountaine <hi>Magnan,</hi> vpon the frontiers of <hi>Fez,</hi> haue noe forme of common wealth, but doe stay trauailers (vnpartiall iudges) to decide their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies. <hi>Leo</hi> himselfe was arrested to bee their iudge, and when hee had spent many dayes in determining their debates, hee was in the end presented with hennes, ducks, geese and other of
<pb facs="tcp:4088:10"/>
their countrie commodities, which serued onelie to discharge his host. And if this your reason should bee of force then were not sociabilitie naturall, because many men haue made choise to liue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
            <p>But how the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wil you say, is nature immutable? It is in <hi>abstracto,</hi> but it is not in <hi>subiecto.</hi> Or thus: In it selfe it is not cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged: in vs, by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, it is. Or els more plainely, it is not changed, but it is tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sgrested. But nature, you say, is alike to al. Not so, good sir: because all are not apt alike to receiue her: euen as the sun beames doe not reflect alike vpon a cleane and cleare glasse, and vpon a glasse that is either filthy or course: And in many, not onely men, but nations, euill custome hath driuen nature out of place, and setteth vp it selfe in steade of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<note n="z" place="margin">l. si quis post. humos. D. de lib. et posth.</note>.</p>
            <p>Your third conclusion, that no particulare forme of gouernement is naturall, doth not finde so easie acceptaunce. Your onely proofe is, that if it were otherwise, there should be one forme of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all nations; because god and nature is one to all. But this reason I haue encountred before: and yet you take paines to puffe it vp with many waste words; howe the Romanes changed gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; how in Italie there is, a pope, a king and many dukes; how <hi>Millaine, Burgundie, Loraine, Bavier, Gascoint,</hi> and <hi>Britaine</hi> the lesse were changed from kingdomes to dukedomes; howe <hi>Germanie</hi> was once vnder one king, and is now deuided among dukes, earles, and other supreme princes; How <hi>Castile, Aragone, Portugall, Barcelona</hi> and other
<pb facs="tcp:4088:10"/>
countries in Spaine, were first Earldomes, then Dukedomes, then seuerall Kingdomes, and now are vnited into one; how <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eme</hi> and <hi>Polonia</hi> were once Dukedomes, and now are Kingdomes; how Fraunce was first one kingdome, then deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into fower, and lastly reduced into one. How England was first a Monarchie, vnder the <hi>Britaines,</hi> then a Prouince vnder the <hi>Romaines,</hi> after that diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into seauen Kingdomes, and lastly reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one; how the people of <hi>Israell</hi> were first vnder Patriarkes, <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> then vnder Captains, then vnder Iudges, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder high Priests, then vnder Kings, and then vnder Captaines and high Priests againe.</p>
            <p>I will not followe you in euery by way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into your errours doe leade (for who would haue aduentured to affirme, that the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Israell</hi> were vnder <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi>; and that the <hi>Britaines</hi> at the first were vnder one King, whereas <hi>Caesar</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that hee found fower kings in that country which is now called <hi>Kent)</hi> but I will onely insist v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the principall point; in regard whereof, all this bundell of wordes is like a blowne bladder, full of winde, but of no weight.</p>
            <p>For first you doe but trifle vpon tearmes, in putting a difference betweene Kings, Dukes, and Earles, which holde their state with soueraigne power. Wee speake not of the names, but of the gouernement of Princes. Supreme rulers may dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in name; they may change name also, either by long vse, or vpon occasion: and yet in gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment neither differ nor change.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4088:11"/>Secondly, it is a more vaine ieast to put a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference (in this regarde) beweene a great territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and a small. If a kingdome bee enlarged or streight<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed in limites, the gouernement is not thereby changed: if many kingdomes bee vnited into one; if one bee diuided into many; the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of gouernment is no more altered, then is the tenure of lande, either when partition is made, or when many partes accrewe into one. The knot of doubt is, whether it bee not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, that one state, bee it great or small, should rather bee commaunded by one person, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer intitled, then by many.</p>
            <p>And if wee descende into true discourse, wee shall finde, that the verie sinewes of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment doe consist, in commaunding and in obeying. But obedience can not bee performed, where the commaundementes are, eyther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant or vncertaine: neither can these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences bee any waies auoided, but by vnion of the authoritie which doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde.</p>
            <p>This vnion is of two sortes; first, when one commaundeth; secondly, when many doe knit in one power and will. The first vnion is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall; the seconde is by meane of amitie, which is the onely bande of this collectiue bodie: and the moe they are who ioyne in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, the lesse naturall is their vnion, and the more subiect to dissipation. For as <hi>Tacitus</hi> saith <note n="'," place="margin">Arduvm sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per codem loci potcutiam &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>But because ambition is a most firy affection, and carieth men blindfold into headlong hopes, wherby many do aspire to beare rule, neither they good, nor with any good either means or end; the custome or lawe of nations hath by two reines endeauored to keep in this raging desire: by succession &amp; by electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And yet againe, because election is most often, if not alwaies, entangled with many inconueniences; as first, for that the outragies during the vacancy, are many &amp; great; euery one that is either grieued or in wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, assuming free power both for reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge &amp; spoile. Secondly, for that the bouldest winneth the garla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d more often then the best; because the fauour of the people doth alwayes tast more of affection then of iudgement. Thirdly, for that they who do not leaue their state to their posterity, wil dissipate the domain and worke out of it either profit or friends; for so we see that the empire of <hi>Germanie</hi> is pluckt bare of her fairest feathers. Fourthly, for that occasions of war are hereby ministred; &amp; that, either whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one taketh his repulse for indignity; vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which ground <hi>Fraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> the first, king of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, could neuer be driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of practise against <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. emperor; or els whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by means of factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s many are elected, as it happened

in <hi>Almaine</hi> when <hi>Lewes</hi> of <hi>Bauier,</hi> and <hi>Albert</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria</hi> were elected Emperors, wherupon eight yeers warre betweene them did ensue; and as it often happened in the Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> when one Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was chosen by the Senate, and another by the Soldiers, and sometimes by euery legion one; whereby such fiers were kindled, as could not bee quenched without much bloude. For these warres are most cruelly executed; because the quarrell lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth no middle state <hi>inter summum &amp; praecipitium; betweene the highest honour and the deadliest downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For these and diuers other respectes, it hath bin obserued, at most times in all nations, and at all times in most, that the roialtie hath passed by suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, according to propinquitie of bloud.

               <note n="i" place="margin">Lib. 16.</note>, that it was against the lawe of Nations, and that v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this occasion one of them did worke the death of the other. And therefore when afterward <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> surnamed <hi>Physcon,</hi> at the importunitie of his wife <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> would haue preferred his youngest son to the succession of his kingdom, <hi>Iustine</hi> saith <note n="k" place="margin">Lib. 39.</note>, that the people opposed themselues against it; but <hi>Pausanias</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">Lib. 1.</note> more probably affirmeth, that they reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his order after his death.</p>
            <p>The same course was held in <hi>Italy</hi> by the <hi>Hetruscanes, Latines,</hi> and those <hi>Albanes</hi> from whome the <hi>Romanes</hi> tooke their originall. <hi>Liuie</hi>

            <p>Seeing therefore that the people may so many wayes loose both their power and their right in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of state, is not your ignorance aduenturous so generallie to affirme, that if no one forme of gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment bee naturall, there is no doubt but the people haue power both to alter and limit the same, as they please? Can no lawe, no custome, no conquest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine them? Your pen doth range, and your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rage beyond al compasse and course of reason. You should haue said, that there is no doubt, but if by al or any of these meanes, the right both of succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and gouernment be setled in one familie, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to propinquitie and prioritie of bloud, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may neither take away nor varie the same: and if they doe, they commit iniustice, they violate the law of nations, whereby they expose themselues, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to the infamie and hate of al men, but to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge of those who wil attempt vppon them. For it is not onlie lawfull but honourable, for any people, either to right or reuenge the breach of this lawe; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them which contemne it, as monsters; against them who knowe it not, as beasts. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith <note n="s" place="margin">v. de ciuit.</note>; <hi>If a Citie vppon earth should decree some great mischiefes to be done, by the decree of mankind it is to be destroied.</hi> And as in the state of one countrey any man may accuse vpon a publicke crime <note place="margin">Inst. de pob. iud.</note>, so in the state of the world, any people may prosecute a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

            <p>You close your conclusion with this conceit, that the word <hi>naturall Prince, or naturall successor,</hi> is to be vnderstood of one, who is borne within the same Realme, and that it is ridiculous to take it, as though anie prince had natural interest to succeed.

            <p>I know not in what sort to deale with you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this interpretation. Shall I labour to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne it by arguments? Why, there is no man that wanteth not either iudgement or sinceritie, but vpon both the naturall and vsuall sense of the words, hee will presently acknowledge it to bee false. Shall I go about either to laugh, or to raile you from your errour, as <hi>Cicero</hi> in the like case perswaded to doe? But this would bee agreeable neither to the stayednesse of our yeeres, nor the grauitie of our professions.

            <p>Presently after the inundation of the world, we find no mention of politike gouernement, but onely of oeconomical, according as men were sorted in fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: for so <hi>Moses</hi> hath written <note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 10.5</note>, that of the progenie of <hi>Iapheth,</hi> the Iles of the Gentiles were deuided after their families. The first, who established go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment ouer manie families, was <hi>Nimrod</hi> the sonne of <hi>Cush,</hi> accounted by Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi>

a spoiler or oppresser. And this doth also appeare by the etymologie of his name; for <hi>Nimrod</hi> signifieth a rebell, a transgressour, and as some interpret it, a terrible Lord: and names were not imposed in aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times by chance or at aduenture, as <hi>Plato</hi>

            <p>Another original of lawes was thus occasioned: When anie people were subdued by armes, lawes were laid like logs vpon their necks, to keepe them in more sure subiection: which both because it is not doubtful, and to auoid prolixitie, I will manifest on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by our owne example.</p>
            <p>When the Romans had reduced the best part of this Iland into the forme of a prouince; as they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted libertie of lawe to no other countrie vnder their obedience, so here also they planted the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of their lawes: and for this purpose they sent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer manie professors, and among others <hi>Papinian,</hi> the most famous both for knowledge and integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, of all the authors of the ciuill lawe.

For howe probable is it, that such a fact, in the open view of his armie, could bee verie obscure? how probable is it also, that the people would first teare him in peeces for his iniustice, and then worship him for a God?

               </note> there was no meanes to appease these tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, but by returning to a monarchie againe. All this I write, rather to manifest the maner of your dealing, then that I hold it much regardable what Romans did.</p>
            <p>Your examples of our present age I will wrap vp in these few words. All nations, very few excepted, do consent in this forme of gouernment; first, to bee vnder one Prince; secondly, to accept him by suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, according to propinquitie of bloud: in other circumstances, either for in augurating their prince, or for the maner of managing and executing his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, not two nations in the world in all points do agree. And yet is not this diuersitie raised, by any lawes which the people doe prescribe vnto their Prince, as you doe most grossely, yea peeuishly, yea maliciously affirme; but by the particular lawes
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4088:29"/>
and customes of euerie nation, in which the consent of the Prince, either secret or expresse, sometimes onely is sufficient, alwayes principally doth concur.</p>
            <p>Vpon this diuersitie of customes you conclude, that it sufficeth not to alleage bare propinquitie of bloud. What? not where that custom is established? as I haue declared it to bee in most nations of the world? doth difference of customes make all custom void? doth diuersitie of custome in some circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces take away the principall custome of succession by bloud? This cleaueth together no surer then sand; you loose both labour and credit in obtruding vnto vs these weake and loose arguments, without either force of reason or forme of Art.</p>
            <p>Your instance of the lawe Salicke in France, doth offer occasion to enter into a large fielde, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I could plainlie prooue, that there was neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie such lawe made to bind the discent of the crowne of Fraunce; and that it hath bin the custome in most parts of the world, not to exclude women from suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession in state: in so much as <hi>Beda</hi>

               </gap> write, that certaine people were gouerned onlie by Princes of that sex. But because this is a matter both of long discourse, and not proper to our purpose, I wil conteine my selfe within this obseruation; That the exclusion of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third from the crowne of Fraunce, vppon this pretence, was the cause of the effusion of their brauest bloud, and of the spoile, wast, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of all that Realme. I acknowedge that the English haue lost the possession of that conquest; and that was by meanes of domestical warres, for
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:4088:30"/>
excluding the neerest in bloud from the crowne; into which vnquiet quarrell, you doe now endeuour againe to imbarke vs. Yet no man can assure that the miseries of Fraunce for this cause are at an end. Rammes recoile to strike harder: we are gone rather backe then away: I will not presage, but anie man may coniecture, that our minds and our meanes will not alwaies want the fauour of time.</p>
            <p>After all this you proceede a degree further: that it is lawfull vpon iust considerations, not only to put backe the next inheritour of the crowne, but also to remoue him who is in full possession thereof. And y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is plaine (you say) not onely by the grounds before by you alleaged, but also by example of the Romans &amp; Graecians: &amp; because God hath commonlie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in such iudiciall actions of the state; not onely in prospering them, but in giuing them also some notable successour. And yet you protest you are far from their opinion, who vpon euerie mislike are readie to band against their Prince; and that you esteem the tenure of a crown, if once it be setled, the most irregular, whereto euery man is bound to settle his conscience, without examination of title or interest; but onely by the supreme law of Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, who can dispence in what he listeth: and that notwithstanding you are as farre, from the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect flatterie of <hi>Billaie</hi> and others; who affirme, that Princes are subiect to no law or limitation at al, and that they succeed by nature and birth onely, and not by admission of the people; and that there is no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie vnder God to chasten them. These you call absurd paradoxes; and herewith you settle your self
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:4088:30"/>
to shewe in the next Chapter, what good successe hath insued the deposition of Princes.</p>
            <p>Concerning your protestation, wee may say vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you as <hi>Isaac</hi> said to his sonne <hi>Iacob</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 27.22</note>. <hi>The voice is Iacobs voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau:</hi> You speake faire, and therewith also well; but the maine drift of your discourse, is nothing else but a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuous doctrine of rebellion and disorder: you being therein like the boatman, who looketh one waie and pulleth another; or rather like the image of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> which looked two contrarie waies at once. It is a rule in lawe; That a protestation contrarie to a mans act, will not serue to relieue him<note n="o" place="margin">Protestatio ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tui contraria non releuat.</note>: onlie this shal serue to conuince you, either of false or of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful dealing, when we come to that place where in flat words you maintaine the contrarie.</p>
            <p>Concerning the querele which you lay against <hi>Billaie</hi>; as I haue not seene what he hath written, so wil I not interpose betweene him and you. I neuer heard of christian prince who challenged infinite au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie without limitation of any law, either natural or diuine. But where you terme it an absurd para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe, that the people should not haue power to chasten their Prince, and vpon iust considerations to remoue him; I am content to ioine with you vppon the issue.</p>
            <p>And first I note the maner of your dealing, in that you haue omitted to expresse what these iust consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations may be. For seeing there hath bin no king, who is not noted of some defects; and againe, no Tyrant, who hath not manie commendable partes (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> writeth <note n="p" place="margin">In Dionys.</note> that <hi>Dionysius</hi> excelled most princes in diuers pointes of iustice and vertue) it
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:4088:31"/>
is a matter of dangerous consequence, to leaue these considerations vndetermined and at large. But who seeth not, that you do it out of pollicie, that you may vpon euerie particular occasion, declare such causes to be sufficient as you please?</p>
            <p>How then doe you proue, that vpon anie cause, the people haue power to dispossesse their prince? This is plaine (you say) not onlie by the groundes before by you alleaged, but also by example of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans &amp; Graecians. The grounds by you alleaged, are two. One in your first Chapter, that because no one forme of gouernment is natural, the people haue power both to choose, and to change, and to limit it as they please. The other ground is in this Chapter; that because there are diuers lawes and customes in matters of principalitie, it sufficeth not to alleage bare propinquitie of bloud.</p>
            <p>Why; but had you no text of scripture, no Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Church to alleage? No lawe? No rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son? No better example? No surer grounde? It is more then this which you bring against your selfe, in citing out of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">2. ca. 2.10.</note>; <hi>The Lord knoweth to reserue the vniust vnto the daie of iudgement; and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciallie them that despise gouernment, and speake euill of those that are in dignitie.</hi> And out of Saint <hi>Iude</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">ver. 8.</note>: <hi>Likewise these dreamers despise gouernment, and speake euill of them that are in authoritie.</hi> Besides also, you haue alleaged out of Saint <note n="s" place="margin">Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Paule: Let euerie soule be subiect vnto the higher power; for there is no power but of God: Whosoeuer therefore resisteth the power, resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth the ordinance of God; and they that resist shall receiue to themselues iudgment.</hi> And likewise out of S. <hi>Peter</hi>: <note n="t" place="margin">1. ca. 2 ver. 13</note> 
               <hi>Submit your selues to euerie humane creature,

whether it be to the king, or vnto gouernors; for so is the will of God.</hi> To which places we maie likewise ad that, which S. <hi>Paule</hi> did write vnto <hi>Titus</hi>
               <note n="u" place="margin">Tit. 3.1.</note>: <hi>Put them in remembrance that they be obedient to the principalities &amp; powers.</hi> And writing to <hi>Timothy</hi>

            <p>But perhaps you wil say, that the Apostles did not meane this of wicked princes. Trifler: the Apostles spake generallie of al: Saint. <hi>Peter</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="margin">1. Pet. 2.18.</note> maketh expresse mention of euil Lords. And what princes haue euer bin more either irreligious or tyrannical, then <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula, Tiberius, Nero,</hi> the infamie of their ages, vnder whose empire the Apostles did both liue and write.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> the great master of controuersies per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing this to be vnanswerablie true, did in another sort rather cut then vntie the knot: affirming <note n="y" place="margin">In tract. de. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emp. clericorum.</note> that at that time it was necessarie to admonish the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to performe obedience to their kings, least the preaching of the Gospel might otherwise be hindred: which is as if in direct tearmes he should haue saide. Sir Kings: whilest our heads were vnder your girdle, we were content to curry fauour, by preaching obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnto the people: but now we haue got the wind of you; we must plainlie tel you, that you hold your crownes at their curtesie and fauour; and haue no power in effect, but as lieutenants general. I know you wil make a sower face at this; it will go very much against your stomackes; but there is no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, you must take it down; they are your good lords; they may dispossesse you.</p>
            <p>Prophane <hi>Bellarmine</hi>: is Christian Religion a meere policie? doth it applie it selfe onlie to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent?
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4088:32"/>

            </p>
            <p>I wil giue you an example of another time. <hi>Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> king of Assyria, wasted al Palestina; tooke Hierusalem; slew the king; burnt the Temple; tooke away the holy vessels and treasure: the residue he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the crueltie and spoile of his vnmerciful soldiers; who defiled al places with rape, ruine and bloud. After the glut of this butcherie, the people which remained, he led captiue into Chaldaea, and there commaunded, that whosoeuer refused to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship his golden image, should be cast into a firie fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace.</p>
            <p>What crueltie, what impietie is comparable to this? and yet the Prophets <hi>Ieremiah</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">ca. 29.7.</note> and <hi>Baruch</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">ca. 1.11.</note> did write to those captiue Iewes, to praie for the pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie and life of him, and of <hi>Baltazar</hi> his sonne, that their daies might be vpon earth as the daies of heauen: and <hi>Ezechiel</hi>

            <p>Many other places there are in holy Scripture, whereby not onely our actions are tied to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; <hi>He that doth presumptuously against the ruler of the people shal die</hi>

that you stand in a strong conceite, either of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of your woord, or simplicitie of our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; otherwise you could not bee perswaded, by these slender threds to draw any man to your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Of the force of examples I haue spoken before; there is no villanie so vile which vvanteth example. And yet most of the examples which you doe bring, are either false, or else impertinent.</p>
            <p>For there haue beene diuers states, wherein one hath borne the name &amp; title of king, without power of Maiestie. As the Romanes in the time of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulate estate, had alwaies a priest, whom they entitled king, whose office consisted in certaine ceremonies &amp; sacrifices, which in former times could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed but by their kings. Likewise the Lacedaemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, after <hi>Licurgus</hi> had formed their gouernment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained two kings, who had no greater stroke in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of state, then a single voice as other Senators. Such were in <hi>Caesars</hi> time many pettie kings of Gaule, who (as <hi>Ambiorix</hi> king of <hi>Leige</hi> confessed) were subiect to their Nobilitie, &amp; iusticeable by them. Such are now the Emperours of Almaine; because the puissance &amp; Maiestie of the empire pertaineth to the states, who are sworne to the empire it selfe, and not to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Emperour. Such are also the Dukes of Venice, the soueraignetie of vvhich state is setled in the gentlemen. In these and such like gouernments, the Prince is not soueraigne, but subiect to that part of the common wealth, which retaineth the royaltie and maiestie of state, whether it be the Nobilitie, or common people: and therefore your examples drawen from them is nothing to our purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4088:36"/>Concerning successe, it cannot bee strange vnto you, that by the secret, yet iust iudgement of God, diuers, euill actions are carried with apparance of good successe The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> said,<note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 73.</note> that his tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings had almost slipt, by seeing the wicked to flourish in prosperitie: the prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi>

               </gap>inde of vermine, which, if it bee permitted to creepe into the bowels of any state, will gnaw the hart strings thereof in sunder. This you manifest by the course comparison which presently you annexe, that as a naturall body hath authoritie, to cure the head if it be out of tune, and reason to cut it off often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, if it were able to take another; so a body poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick hath power to cure or cut off the head, if it be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound. But what either will or power hath any part of the body in it selfe? what either sence for the one, or motion for the other, which proceedeth not altogether from the head? where is the reason seated which you attribute to the body, both in iudging and curing the infirmities of the head? Certaine it is, that in your cutting cure you deale like a foolish phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who finding a body halfe taken and benummed with a palsie, cutteth off that part to cure the other, and so make sure to destroy both. You suppose belike that to enter into greater perills, is the onely remedie of present dangers. I omit to presse many points of this comparison against you, because comparisons do serue rather to illustrate then inforce: and I know not what assertion you might not easely make good, if such sencelesse prating might goe for proofe.</p>
            <p>I come now to your particular examples, wherof the first is of King Saule; whom you affirme to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued and put to death for his disobedience. <hi>Saule depriued and put to death?</hi> I neuer heard that any of his subiects did euer lift vp one thought against him. Dreamer, you will say, hee was slaine by the Philistimes: good; but who depriued him; it was God (you say) who did depriue him? You must
<pb facs="tcp:4088:37"/>
pardon vs if vpon the sodaine wee doe not conceiue the misterie of your meaning: your vvords of depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and putting to death, doe rather import a iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall proceeding against him, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that God deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to be vanquished, by his enemies in the field. But vvhat is this to dispossessing by subiects? yes, you say, because vvhat soeuer God hath put in vre in his common vvealth, may be practised by others.

For vvhen <hi>Saul</hi> did most violently persecute him, he defended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe no otherwise then by flight. During this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit, <hi>Saul</hi> fell twice in to his power; once he dyd not onely spare but protect him, and rebuke the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian soldiers for their negligent vvatch: the other time his hart did smite him, for that he had cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the lappe of his garment. Lastly, he caused the messenger to be slaine, vvho vpon request, and for pittie, had furthered (as he said) the death of that sacred King. Wee haue a precept of obedience, vvhich is the mould vvherein vvee ought to fashion

our actions. God onely is superiour to princes; vvho vseth many instruments in the execution of his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, but his aucthoritie he hath committed vnto none.</p>
            <p>Your second example is of king <hi>Amon,</hi> vvho vvas slaine (as you vvright) by his owne people; because he vvalked not in the vvayes of the Lord. This is somewhat indeed if it be true; let vs turne to the text. <note n="f" place="margin">4 reg. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Amon was xxii. yeeres ould when he began to reigne &amp;c. and he did euill in the sight of the Lord &amp;c. and his seruants conspired against him, &amp; slew him in his house, and the people smote all those who conspired against king Amon, and made Iosiah his sonne king in his stead.</hi> But this is very different from that which you report. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> was slaine by his seruants, and not by the people; who were so far from working, that they seuerely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged his death. And although <hi>Amon</hi> was euill, yet the scripture laieth not his euill for the motiue wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon his seruants slue him. The diuell himselfe in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaging the scripture, vsed more honestie &amp; sinceritie (if I may so terme it) then you: for he cited the very vvords, vvresting them onely to a crooked sence: but you change the vvords of the Scripture; you counterfeit Gods coine, you corrupt the recordes vvhich he hath left vs. I vvill now shake of all res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of ciuilitie towards you, and tell you in flat and open termes; that as one part of your asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is true, that good Kings succeeded <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Amon</hi>; so the other part, that either they vvere, or in right could haue bene depriued and put to death by their subiects, it is a sacrilegious, a logger-headed lye.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:4088:38"/>Of your example of Romulus I haue spoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. I haue declared also how the Romanes, present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the expelling of their kings, &amp; for that cause, were almost ouerwhelmed with the weight of warre; being beaten home to the very gates of their citie. And had not <hi>Chocles</hi> by a miracle of manhood su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steined the shock of the enemies, whilest a bridge was broken behind him, the towne had bene entred and their state ruined.

            <p>In your example of <hi>Caesar,</hi> I neuer saw more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes crowded together in fewer words: you say he brake all lawes, both humane and deuine: that is one; his greatest enemies did giue of him a most honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble testimonie. You say he tooke all gouernment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands alone: that is two; the people by the law <hi>Seruia</hi> elected him perpetual dictator. You make his death to be an act of the state: that is three; for they who slew him, were both declared &amp; pursued by decree of the state for publicke enemies; of whom,
<pb facs="tcp:4088:38"/>
not any one, either died a naturall death, or liued three yeeres after; it was further decreed, that the court where he was slaine should be stopped vp, that the Ides of March should be called <hi>parricidium</hi>; &amp; that the Senate should neuer be assembled vpon that day. You say that <hi>Augustus</hi> was preferred in his place: that is foure; and all within the compasse of sixe lines. <hi>Augustus</hi> was neuer chosen dictator; <hi>Suetonius</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <note n="g" place="margin">In Augusto, genu nixus dictaturam deprecatus est,</note> that hee entreated the people vpon his knee, not to charge him with that office.

            <p>The historie of <hi>Alphonso,</hi> another of your exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb facs="tcp:4088:40"/>
standeth thus. <hi>Alphonso</hi> had a sonne called <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> who died during the life of his father, &amp; left two yong sons behinde him. After the death of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> his yonger brother <hi>Sancho</hi> practised with D. <hi>Lope Diaz de Haro</hi> Lord of Biscay, to procure him to be aduanced to the successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the kingdom, before his nephewes. D. <hi>Lope</hi> vndertoke the deuise; &amp; drawing some other of the nobilitie to the partie, they so wrought with the king, that in an assembly of the states at <hi>Segouia, Sancho</hi> was declared successor, &amp; the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be kept in prison. But <hi>Sancho,</hi> either impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to linger in expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or suspicious that his father grew inclinable towards his nephewes, made league with <hi>Mahomed Mir,</hi> king of <hi>Granado,</hi> a <hi>Moore</hi>; by whose ayde, &amp; by the nobilitie of his faction, he caused him selfe to be declared king. Heerevpon, <hi>Alphonso</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to craue assistance of <hi>Iacob Aben Ioseph</hi> king of Maroco, who before had bene an enemie to <hi>Alpho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>so:</hi> but vpon detestatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this vnnatural rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he sent forces to him, protesting notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that so soone as the war should be ended, he wold become his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie againe. So <hi>Alphonso</hi> by help, partly of the <hi>Marocco</hi> Moores, &amp; partly of his subiects which remained loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, maintained against his sonne both his title &amp; state during his lyfe, but not without extremitie of bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed; &amp; opportunitie for the Moores, being assista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to both parties, to make themselues more strong with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the countries of Spaine. For this cause <hi>Alphonso</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherited his sonne by his testament, and cast a cruell cursse vpon him &amp; his posteritie: &amp; afterward it vvas ordeined in an assembly of the states holden at <hi>Tero,</hi> that the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the elder brother deceased, should
<pb facs="tcp:4088:41"/>
be preferred before their vnckle.</p>
            <p>How then will you verifie your two points by this historie? First, that <hi>Alphonso</hi> vvas depriued by a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick act of parlament: secondly, that it turned to the great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of the state. It is not a millio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> that are sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to satisfie for all your deceitful &amp; malicious vntruthes. I meruaile how the rebellion of <hi>Absolon,</hi> against king <hi>Dauid</hi> his father escaped you: Oh; it wanted successe; &amp; you could not so easily disguise the report.</p>
            <p>You write that the common wealth of <hi>Spaine,</hi> resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to depose D. <hi>Pedro</hi> the cruell, sent for his brother <hi>Henry</hi> out of france, &amp; required him to bring a strength of frenchmen with him: but hereby you make it plain, that the common wealth was not fully agreed. The truth is, that this was a dangerous deuisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the state, between two concurrents; some holding for <hi>Henry,</hi> &amp; some for <hi>Pedro. Henry</hi> obtained forren asistance by the french, <hi>Pedro</hi> by the english. In the meane time, whilst <hi>Peter</hi> was throwen out of state by the forces of france, &amp; after that <hi>Henry</hi> by the armes of england; &amp; againe <hi>Peter</hi> deiected both from dignitie and life by his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Henry</hi>; the poore country became a spectacle for one of your enterludes.</p>
            <p>Your example of <hi>Don Sancho Capello</hi> king of Portugal, containeth many intollerable vntruthes. For neither was he depriued of his dignitie, neither did the Pope &amp; counsell of Lions giue either authoritie or consent that he should be depriued; neither was he driuen out of his realme into <hi>Castilla;</hi> neither died he in banishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; neither was <hi>Alphonso</hi> his brother king during his life. These fiue vntruths you huddle into one heape. The counsaile of <hi>Lions</hi> wholy opposed against the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb facs="tcp:4088:41"/>
of <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> notwithstanding many disabilities were obiected against him: in regard wherof they gaue directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that <hi>Alphonso</hi> his brother should be regent of the realme; as in that case it is both vsuall &amp; fit. But <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> taking this to dislike, did seeke aide of the king of <hi>Castile</hi>; &amp; in that pursuite ended his life without issue: wherby the right of succession deuolued to <hi>Alphonso.</hi>

            <p>The deposing of <hi>Henry</hi> king of Polonia, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be both true &amp; iust; I haue nothing to except against it. When the crowne of France did discend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, he forsooke Polonia, &amp; refused to return again to that swaggering gouernment, wherevpon they did depose him. Giue vs the like case, &amp; you shal be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the like proceeding; but you esteeme your exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples by tale &amp; not by touch: being not much vnlike a certaine mad fellow in Athens, who imagined eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ship which was brought into the hauen to be his: for vvhatsoeuer you finde of a king deposed, you lay claime vnto it, as both lawfully done, and pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to your purpose, whereas one of these doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies faile.</p>

               </gap>er. The nobility of those countries prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that their kings are not soueraigne, but that the power in highest matters of state pertaineth vnto them. If it bee thus, the examples are not appliable to the question, if it be otherwise, then the princes had wrong.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4088:42"/>Wee are come now to our domesticall examples; the first whereof is that of king <hi>Iohn,</hi> who was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the Pope, you say, at the suite of his owne people. All this people was the Archbishop of Cant. the bish. of London, and the bish. of Ely; at whose co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint, the Pope did write to <hi>Phillip</hi> king of France, that hee should expell king <hi>Iohn</hi> out of his realme. If not conscience, if not ordinarie honestie, pure shame should haue drawen you to another forme of writing. Hee was also depriued (you say) afterwards by his Barons. Heauy beast; call you this a depriuation? The commons were neuer called to consent; the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie were so opposite to those that stoode in armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst king <hi>Iohn,</hi> that they procured excommunication against them: first generally; then by name; lastly, <hi>Lewes</hi> the French kings sonne was also included: of the Nobilitie, which is onely the third state of the realme, I make no doubt but some reserued themselues to bee guided by successe; others, and namely the Earles of <hi>Warren, Arundell, Chester, Penbrooke, Ferrers, Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie,</hi> and diuers Barons did openly adhere vnto king <hi>Iohn</hi>; you may as well call any other rebellion a depriuation, as affirme that the rest either did or might depriue him. And whereas you bring in king Henry the third, as a most worthie succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour after this depriuation; I will derogate nothing from his worthinesse: but there was neuer king in England, who without concurrent in the title of the crowne, did draw more bloud out of the sides of his subiects.</p>
            <p>Your second example is of king <hi>Edward</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
<pb facs="tcp:4088:42"/>
whom many of our histories report to bee of a good and courteous nature and not vnlearned; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting his defectes rather to Fortune, then either to counsell or carriage of his affaires. His deposition was a violent furie, led by a vvife, both cruell &amp; vnchast; &amp; can with no better countenance of right be iustified, then may his lamentable both indignities and death, vvhich therupon did ensue. And although the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, by submitting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to the gouerment of his sonne, did breake those occasions of wars which doe vsually rise vpon such disorders, yet did not the hand of God forget to pursue reuenge. For albeit king <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> his son enioyed both a long &amp; prosperous raign, yet his next successor king <hi>Richard</hi> the second, vvas in the like violent manner imprisoned depriued &amp; put to death. I will prosecute the successiue reuenge which heereof also ensued, being a strange matter, &amp; worthie to be rung into the eares of all ages. King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, by whom king <hi>Richard</hi> was deposed, did exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise the chiefest acts of his raigne, in executing those who conspired with him against king <hi>Richard.</hi> His son had his vertue well seconded by felicity; during whose raigne by meanes of the wars in France, the humour against him was otherwise imployed &amp; spent: but his next successor king <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth was in the very like manner depriued, &amp; together with his yong son <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> imprisoned and put to death by king <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth. This <hi>Edward</hi> died not without suspicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; &amp; after his death, his two sons were in like maner disinherited, imprisoned &amp; murthered by their cruell vnkle, the duke of Glocester: who being both a tyrant and vsurper, was iustly encountred and slaine, by king
<pb facs="tcp:4088:43"/>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the seauenth, in the field. So infallible is the law of iustice in reuenging cruelties and wrongs, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies obseruing the presence of times wherein they are done, but often calling them into reckoning; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the offenders retaine least memorie of them.</p>
            <p>Likewise the deposition of king <hi>Richard</hi> the second was a tempestuous rage, neither led nor restrained by any rules of reason or of state; not sodainely rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and at once, but by very cunning and artificiall degrees. But examine his actions vvithout distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pred iudgement, &amp; you will not condemne him to be exceeding either insufficient or euill weigh the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that were obiected against him, and you shall find nothing either of any truth or of great moment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hollingshead</hi> writeth <note place="margin">in Richard, 2.</note>, that he was most vnthankfully vsed by his subiects; for although, through the frailtie of his youth, he demeaned himselfe more dissolutely, then was agreeable to the royaltie of his estate, yet in no kings daies, the commons were in greater wealth, the Nobilitie more honoured, and the Clergie lesse wronged: vvho notwithstanding in the euill guided strength of their will tooke head against him, to their owne headlong destruction afterward: partly during the raign of king <hi>Henry,</hi> his next successor, whose grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test atchiuements were against his owne people; but more especially in succeeding times, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this disorder, more english bloud was spent, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was in all the forren wars which had ben since the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest. Three causes are commonly insinuated by you, for which a king may be deposed; tyranny, insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, &amp; impietie: but what prince could hold his state, what people their quiet assured, if this your doctrine
<pb facs="tcp:4088:43"/>
should take place? how many good princes doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie brand with one of these markes? what action of state can be so ordred, that either blind ignorance or set mallice wil not easely straine to one of these heads? euery execution of iustice, euery demand of tribute or supply shall be claimed tyrannie: euery infortunate euent shall be exclaimed insufficiencie: euery kind of religion shall by them of another sect, be proclaimed impietie. So dangerous it is to permit this high power to a heedlesse and headlesse multitude, who measure things, not by reason and iustice, but either by opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which commonly is partiall; or else by report, which vsually is full of vncertainties and errors: the most part doing because others doe; all easie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come slauish to any mans ambitious attempt. So dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous it is to open our eares to euery foolish Phaeto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who vndertaking to guid the chariot of the Sun will soone cast the whole earth into combustion.</p>
            <p>You proceede that king <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth was also deposed for defectes in gouernment. Let vs yeeld a little to you, that you may bee deceiued; a little that you may be carried by your affections; how can you excuse these open vntruthes, wherein it cannot bee but the diuell hath a finger? you cannot bee ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that the onely cause which drevv the familie of Yorke into armes against king <hi>Henry,</hi> vvas the title which they had vnto the crowne: by vertue whereof, it vvas first enacted, that <hi>Richard</hi> duke of Yorke should succeed king <hi>Henry,</hi> after his death: but for that hee made vnseasonable attempts, he was declared by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament incapable of succession, and afterwards slaine at the battaile of wakefield.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4088:44"/>Then <hi>Edward</hi> his sonne, prosecuting the enterprise, &amp; hauing vanquished king <hi>Henry</hi> at the battaile of S. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bons,</hi> obtained possession of the state, caused king <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye</hi> to be deposed, and himselfe to be proclaimed &amp; crowned king. Afterward he vvas chased out of the realme, and by act of parlament both depriued and disabled from the crowne. Lastly he returned againe, and depriued king <hi>Henrye</hi> both from gouernment &amp; from life. It is true, that some defects vvere obiected against king <hi>Henry</hi>; but this was to estra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the harts of the peple fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. The main cause of the war did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the right of the one partie, &amp; possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the other: The contrarietie of the acts of parlament vvas caused, by the alternatiue victories of them both.</p>
            <p>Your last example is of king <hi>Richard</hi> the third, of vvhom you vvright; First, that although he sinned in murthering his Nephewes, yet after their death hee vvas lawfull king: Secondly, that he was deposed by the common wealth, who called out of France <hi>Henry</hi> earle of Richmond, to put him downe, Philosophers say that dreames doe commonly arise, by a reflection of the phantasie vpon some subiect, wherof we haue meditated the daie before. It may be y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> your drowsie conceit vvas here cast into a dreame, of that vvheron it had dozed in all this chapter: Or at the best, that you are like vnto those, vvho haue so often tould a lie, that they perswade themselues it is true. King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth left other children besides those that were murthered; the duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> also, vvho vvas elder brother to king <hi>Richard,</hi> lest issue in life; all vvhich had precedence of right before him. And as for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond point, tell mee I pray you, by vvhat parlament

vvas king <hi>Richard</hi> deposed? vvher did the states assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? vvhen did they send for the earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> to put him down? by what decree? by vvhat messengers? Ther is no answer to be made, but one; and that is, to confesse ingenuously, that you say vntrue; &amp; that it is your vsuall manner of deceiuing, to impute the act of a few vnto all; &amp; to make euerie euent of armes, to be a iudicial proceeding of the common wealth. For it is manifest, that the earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> had his first stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth from the king of France; &amp; that after his discent into England, more by halfe, both of the nobilitie &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people did stand for king <hi>Richard,</hi> then stirre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him. You adioyne for a speciall consideration, that most excellent princes succeeded these vvhom you affirme to be deposed. I vvill nor extenuate the excellencie of any Prince; but I hould it more vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be considered, that these disorders spent Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land a sea of bloud.</p>
            <p>In the ende you conclude, that all these depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations of Princes vvere lawfull. Nay; by your fauour; if you sweat out your braines, you shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer euince, that a fact is lawfull beecause it is done. Yes (you say) for othervvise two great inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences vvould follow; one, that the actes of those that vvere put in their place, should be voide and vniust: the other, that none vvho now pretend to these Crownes, could haue any tytle, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>You deserue now to be basted with words vvell sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in vineger and salt: but I will be more charitable vnto you, and leaue bad speaches to black mouthes.

            <p>After this, you proceede further to make good, that the Princes before mencioned vvere lawfully deposed; and that by all law; both diuine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, naturall, nationall and positiue. Your cause is so badd, that you haue need to set a bould coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance vpon it. But what deuine lawes doe you alleage? You haue largely beefore declared (you saye) that GOD doth approoue the forme of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vvhich euery common wealth doth choose,
<pb facs="tcp:4088:46"/>
as also the conditions and statutes which it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point vnto her prince. I must now take you for a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall lyer, when you wil not forbeare to bely your selfe: you neuer proued any such matter; &amp; the contrary is euident, that sometimes entire gouernments; often, customes &amp; statutes of state; &amp; very commonly acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, are so vnnaturall &amp; vniust, that (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then for a punishment and curse) wee cannot say that God doth approue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. We haue often heard that the Church cannot erre in matters of Faith; but that in matter of gouerment a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth cannot erre, it was neuer (I assure my selfe) published before.</p>
            <p>But let vs suppose (supposall is free) that God alloweth that forme of gouernment which euery common wealth doth choose: doth it therfore follow that by all deuine lawes princes may be deposed by their subiects? these broken peeces will neuer bee squared to forme strong argument. But wherefore doe not you produce the deuine canons of scripture? surely, they abhorre to speake one word in your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe: yea, they doe giue expresse sentence against you, as I haue shewed before.</p>
            <p>Well let this passe among your least escapes, in making God either the author or aider of rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: you alledge no other humane law, but that princes are subiect vnto law and order. I vvill not denie but ther is a duty for princes to performe: but how proue you that their subiects haue power to depose them if they faile? In this manner. As the common vvealth gaue them their authoritie for the common good, so it may also take the same away, if they abbuse it. But I haue manifested before <note n="c" place="margin">Cap. 1.</note>, both that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

               </gap>t; &amp; also that few princes in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> world hold their state by graunt of the people. I will neuer heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after esteeme a mans valure by his voice: Your braue boast of all lawes, diuine, humane, naturall, nationall and positiue, is disolued into smoake: you busie your selfe as the Poets wright of <hi>Morpheus,</hi> in presenting shadowes to men a sleepe.</p>
            <p>But the chiefest reason (you say) the very ground and foundation of all. Soft: what reason? what ground? if you haue alreadie made proofe by all lawes, humane and deuine, naturall, nationall and positiue, what better reason? what surer ground will you bring? Tush: these interruptions. The chiefest reason (you say) the very ground and foundation of all is, that the common wealth is superiour to the prince; and that the authoritie which the prince hath, is not absolute, but by the way of mandate and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from the common wealth.</p>
            <p>This is that which I expected all this time: you haue hetherto approached by stealing steps, you are now come cloase to the wall, do but mount into credit and the fort is your owne.

            </p>
            <p>Further, all states take denomination from that part wherin the supreme power is setled; as if it bee in one prince, it is called a monarchie; if in many of highest ranck, then it is an aristocracie; if in the people, then a democracie.

            <p>You proceede that the power of a prince is giuen to him by the common wealth, with such conditions &amp; exceptions, as if the same be not kept, the people stand free. That the prince receiueth his power vnder plain conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, you go about to proue afterward: now you hold on, that in all mutual contracts, if one side recede from promise, the other remaineth not obliged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; this you proue by two rules of the law.

            <p>Poore fellow, had you ben as conuersant in the light of law, and cleere course of iustice, as you are in the smoake &amp; dust of some corner of a colledge, you wold neuer haue concluded so generally so confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any of the rules of law, which are subiect, for the most part, vnto many exceptions. <hi>Alexander</hi>

               <hi>In euill promises, break your word; in a dishonest oath change your purpose.</hi>

            <p>Well fare your vvits, good soule; doe you accompt the promise of obedience euill? not so (I suppose you will say) but it turneth to be euill vvhen it tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the notable detrime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth. It is one of your peculiar guifts, the further you goe, the more impious you declare your selfe. For if you take the word euill in noe higher sence then for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment and damage, it would follow vpon your rule, that a man vvere no further tyed to his promise, then the performance thereof were aduantageable vnto him. You vvould inforce also, that if the father doth dissipate his patrimoniall estate, and runne a course to ruine his familie, the children and the wife may thervpon disauow their duties.</p>
            <p>But if vvee take a true touch of this point, we shall finde, that the vices of any Prince are not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient of themselues to ouerthrow a state, except therevpon rebellions be raised, vvhich vvill draw all things into confusion. For there is no Prince, vvhich either hath liued, or can almost be imagined to liue, in so little sence of humanitie, but general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he both fauoureth and maintaineth some order of iustice; onely against particuler persons, some of
<pb facs="tcp:4088:50"/>
them haue violently bene carried by the tempest of their passion, vvhereby notwithstanding the inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate desires of one man, can not possibly reach to the ruine of all.</p>
            <p>So saith <hi>Suetonius,</hi>

For as it is the nature of men, vvhen they come out of one extremitie vvherin they haue bene houlden by force, to runne vvith a swift course into another, vvithout staying in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest; so the people breaking out of tyrannie, if they bee not helde back, vvill runne headlong into vnbrideled libertie; and the harder they vvere kept vnder beefore, the more insolently vvill they then insult.</p>

            <p>Surely, if you had been aduised, you would priuily haue blowen your blasphemies into the eares of those ideots, who adore you for the great penitentiaries of the sea of Rome, &amp; esteeme your idle imaginations as the articles of their faith: &amp; not so publikely haue pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth your self into these paradoxes, both impious &amp; absurd; not so boisterously haue stepped, like <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les Furens,</hi> vpon the ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> stage of the world, to denou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce depriuation against all princes.

in inuocating the diuell. For first, you are thereby dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered to be, neither religious, modest, nor wise: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, you haue runne your selfe into the compasse of a Canon, in the councell of Chalcedon. <note n="q" place="margin">C. coniura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> xj q j.</note> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is thus decreed against you: <hi>If Clerkes shall be found to be contriuers of conspiracies, or raisers of factions, let them be degraded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this you declare, who is a tyrant; and that is a king, (you say) if once he doth decline from his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: which is a large description, and fit to set all chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian countries on floate with bloud. <hi>Comines</hi> saith, that he is to be esteemed a good king, whose vertues are not ouerballanced by vice.</p>
            <p>I omit your thicke error in putting no difference betweene a magistrate and a king, with many other of like qualitie, and do come now to a principall point of your strength: that Christian princes at this day are admitted vpon conditions, and likewise with prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations, that if they do not performe the same, their subiects are free from all alleageance.

            </p>
            <p>Againe, when the promise is not annexed to the authoritie, but voluntarily and freely made by the Prince, his estate is not thereby made conditionall.

            <p>Of this sort was that which you report of <hi>Traian,</hi> who in deliuering the sword to his gouernors, would say: <hi>If I raigne iustly, then vse it for me; if otherwise, then vse it against me</hi>: but where you adde, that these are the very same words in effect, which Princes do vse at their coronations, (pardon me, for it is fit I should be mooued) you will find it to bee a very base <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Alexander,</hi> to extend no further then when the lawes shall be both profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and iust: because Iustice and the common benefit of subiects, is the principal point, both of the oath and dutie of a Prince, whereto all other clauses must be referred. And now to your examples.</p>
            <p>First, because in all the ranke of the Hebrew kings, you cannot find either condition or oath; not: in the auncient Empires and kingdomes of the world; not vsually in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lourishing time of the Romaine state, both vnder heathen and christian Emperors; because these times are too pure for your purpose, you fumble foorth a dull coniecture: That forsomuch as the first kings were elected by the people, it is like that they did it vpon conditions and assurances for themselues. That the first kings receiued not their authoritie from the people, I haue manifested before<note n="c" place="margin">In cap. 1.</note>: and yet your inference hereupon is no other, then if you should sue in some Court for a legacie, alleadging nothing for your intent, but that it is like the Testator shold leaue you something; in which case it is like (I suppose) that your plea wold be answered with a silent scorne.</p>
            <p>After a few loose speeches, which no man would stoupe to gather together, you bring in the example of <hi>Anastasius</hi> the first Emperour of <hi>Constantinople</hi>; of whom the Patriarch <hi>Euphemius</hi> required before his coronation, a confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the faith in writing, wherin
<pb facs="tcp:4088:53"/>
he should promise to innouate nothing. And further, he promised to take away certaine oppressions, and to giue offices without mony. Let vs take things as they are, and not speake vpon idle imagination, but agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to sence: what either condition or restraint do you find in these words? Condition they do not forme, because in case of failance they do not make the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie void: neither do they make restraint, because they containe no point, whereunto the lawe of God did not restraine him. All this he was bound to performe without an oath; and if he were a thousand times sworne, he was no more but bound to perform it: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as if a father should giue his word to cloath and feede his child; or the husband to loue his wife; or any man to discharge that dutie, which God and Nature doth require. It is true, that <hi>Anastasius</hi> was both a wicked man, and iustly punished by God for the breach of his faith; but his subiects did neuer challenge to be free therefore from their alleageance.</p>
            <p>The same aunswere may be giuen to the promise, which <hi>Michael</hi> the first gaue to <hi>Nicephorus</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch: <hi>That he would not violate the Ordinances of the Church, nor embrue his hands with innocent bloud</hi>; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if you take the word <hi>Ordinances</hi> for matters ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to be beleeued: but if you take it in a larger sence, then haue I also declared in the beginning of this chapter, how farre the promise doth extend.</p>
            <p>Your next example is of the Empire of Almaine; from whence all that you obiect, doth fall within this circle. After the death of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, the empire was held by right of succession, vntill his line was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in <hi>Conrade</hi> the first. After whose death it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb facs="tcp:4088:54"/>
came electiue: first in <hi>Henry</hi> duke of Saxony, then in <hi>Otho</hi> his son; and afterwards in the rest: from whom notwithstanding no other promise was wrested, but the discharge of that dutie, which they were enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, or rather threatned, that God wold seuerely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act at their hands. But (as in all electiue States it vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally hapneth) at euery new change and choise, the Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peror was deplumed of some of his feathers, vntill in the end he was made naked of authoritie, the Princes hauing drawne all power to themselues.</p>
            <p>So by degrees the Empire was changed from a Monarchie to a pure aristocracie; the Emperour bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the title thereof, but the maiestie and puissance remaining in the States. During which weaknesse of the Emperour, some points were added to his oath, which seemed to derogate from the soueraigntie of his estate. But what is this to those Princes, who haue retained their dignitie, without any diminution, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of authoritie, or of honour.</p>
            <p>The like may be said of Polonia, which not many hundred yeares since was erected into a kingdome: and although the States did challenge therein a right of election, yet did it alwaies passe according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinquitie of bloud, and was esteemed a soueraigne Monarchie; vntill after the death of <hi>Casimire</hi> the Great, when <hi>Lodonicus</hi> his Nephew King of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie, rather greedie then desirous to be king also of Polonia, did much abase the Maiestie thereof. Yet falling a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>terward into the line of <hi>Iagello,</hi> who maried one of the daughters of <hi>Lodowicke,</hi> it recouered the auncient both dignitie and strength. But when that line also failed in <hi>Sigismond Augustus,</hi> the last male
<pb facs="tcp:4088:54"/>
of that Familie, the States elected <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of Anjowe for their King, with this clause irritant; That if hee did violate any point of his oath, the people should owe him no alleageance. But whereas you report this as the vsuall oath of the Kinges of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia, you deserue to heare the plainest tearme of vntruth.</p>
            <p>In the kingdome of Spaine you distinguish two times: one, before the conquest thereof by the Moores; the other, after it was recouered againe by the Christians. I acknowledge a difference in these two times; for that in the one, the right of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was electiue; in the other, it hath alwaies remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned successiue: insomuch as <note n="d" place="margin">In spec. tit. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Peter Belluga,</hi> a diligent writer of the rights of Arragon, doth affirme, that the people haue no power in election of the king,<note n="*" place="margin">Veniamus n. 10.</note> except in case the line should faile.</p>
            <p>Concerning the matter in controuersie, you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that the kings did sweare the same points in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which before haue bene mentioned. This wee must take vpon your forfeited faith, for you alleadge no forme of oath; onely you write, that the fourth nationall Councell of <note n="c" place="margin">An. 633. cap. 74.</note> Toledo, with all humilitie conuenient did require, that the present king, and all other that should follow, would be meeke and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate towardes their subiects, and gouerne them with iustice, and not giue sentence in causes capitall without assistance: declaring further, that if any of them should exercise cruell and proude authoritie, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> they were condemned by Christ, with the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Excommunication, and separated to euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting iudgement.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4088:55"/>But what pang hath possessed your dreaming braines, to tearme this by a marginall note, <hi>Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of raigning in Spaine?</hi> being no other then a reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and graue admonition of the dutie of a king, with a feareful declaration of the iudgment of God against wicked Princes. And that which was afterward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in the sixt Councell of Toledo: <hi>That the king should sweare, not to suffer any man to breake the Catholike faith,</hi> because it is a principall point of his dutie, his estate was not thereby made conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</p>
            <p>The rest of this passage you fill vppe with froath of the antiquated lawe of <hi>Don Pelayo,</hi> prescribing a forme of inaugurating the Kinges of Spaine; whereof there is not one point, either now in vse, or pertaining to the purpose. So miserable is your case, that you can write nothing therein, but that which is either impertinent or vntrue.</p>
            <p>For Fraunce, your first example is taken from the coronation of <hi>Philip</hi> the first: wherein you note, that king <hi>Henrie</hi> his father requested the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to sweare obedience to his sonne; inferring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that a coronation requireth a new consent, which includeth a certaine election of the subiects. But this is so light, that the least breath is sufficient to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse it. <hi>Philip</hi> was crowned king during the life of his father: which action, as it was not ordinarie, so was it of such both difficultie and weight, that it could not be effected without assemblie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the States.

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4088:56"/>I haue pressed this point the rather in this place, because you write, that most neighbour nations haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the forme of annointing &amp; crowning their kings, from the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t custome of <hi>France</hi>; although the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce be deduced from the first kings of the Hebrews, as appeareth by the annointing of king <hi>Saule</hi>: whereof <hi>Dauid</hi> (you say) made great accompt, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that <hi>Saule</hi> had bene reiected by God, and that himselfe had lawfully borne armes against him.</p>
            <p>Out Atheist; you would be dawbed with dung, &amp; haue the most vile filth of your stewes cast in your face. Did <hi>Dauid</hi> beare armes against his annointed king? did he euer lift vp his eye-lids against him? did he euer so much as defend himselfe otherwise then by flight? It is certaine that <hi>Shemei</hi> did not halfe so cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly either curse or reuile this holy man, who did so much both by speech and action detest this fact, that he would rather haue endured ten thousand deaths, then to haue defiled his soule with so damnable a thought. What then shall we say vnto you, who to set vp sedition and tumult, abuse all diuine &amp; humane wrightings, in whatsoeuer you beleeue will aduance your purpose? who spend some speech of respect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to kings for allurement onely, to draw vs more deepe into your deceit? Shall we giue any further eare to your doctrine, both blasphemous and bloudy? We will heare you to the end; and I deceiue my selfe, but your owne tale shall, in any moderate iudgement, condemne the authoritie of your opinions for euer.</p>
            <p>Let vs come then to your last example (which is neither the last nor the least whereat you leuell.) And that is of <hi>England,</hi> which of all other kingdomes
<pb facs="tcp:4088:56"/>
(you say) hath most particularly taken this ceremony of Sacring and annointing from <hi>France.</hi> Well, let the ceremonie be taken from whence you please: if the oath be no other then you do specifie, <hi>To obserue peace, honour and reuerence, vnto Almighty God, to his Church and to the Ministers of the same, to administer Law and Iustice equally to all; to abrogate euill lawes and customes, and maintaine good</hi> (which was the oath of king <hi>Richard</hi> the first; the like whereto was that of king <hi>Iohn,</hi> altered only in the first branch: <hi>To loue and defend the Catholicke Church:</hi>) If the oath be no other I say, I do not see what other answer you need to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, but that it is onely a free royall promise, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge that duty which God doth impose. And this is plainely declared by the speech which you alleage, of <hi>Thomas Arundell</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to king <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth; <hi>Remember</hi> (saith he) <hi>the oath which voluntarily you made:</hi> voluntarily he sayd, and not necessarily: it was voluntary in oath, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in duty. That which you report also that <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Becket</hi> did write vnto king <hi>Henry</hi> the second, importeth nothing else but an acknowledgement of duty: <hi>Remember</hi> (said he) <hi>the confession which you made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot omit your description of the manner of the Coronation in <hi>England.</hi> First (you say) the king i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> sworne; then the Archbishop declareth to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple what he hath sworne, and demaundeth if they be content to submit themselues vnto him vnder those conditions: whereunto they consenting, he putteth on the royall ornaments; and then addeth the words of commission: <hi>Stand and hold thy place, and keepe thy oath.</hi> And thus you haue hammered out a formall
<pb facs="tcp:4088:57"/>
election, supposing that you draw together the pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of falshood so close, that no man can perceiue the seame. The truth is, that king <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth being not the nearest in bloud to the inheritance of the crowne, did countenance his violence with the election of the people; not at his Coronation, but in a Parliament that was holden before. And therefore you do impudently abuse vs; First, in ioyning them together as one act; Secondly, by falsifying diuerse points in both; Lastly, by insinuating that the same order was obserued by other kings.</p>
            <p>The points which you falsifie are these: The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation of the Archbishop to the people: the absurd straining of these words, <hi>Stand, hold thy place,</hi> to be a Commission: the alleaging also out of <hi>Stow,</hi> 1. That the Archbishop did reade vnto the people, what the King was bound vnto by oath; 2. That the Earle of <hi>Northumberland</hi> did shew a ring vnto the people, that they might thereby see the band whereby the king was bound vnto them; 3. That the king did pray, that he might obserue his promise. In which composition of conceits, you shew how actiue you are in counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faiting any thing, that may make to your purpose; perswading your selfe, that it is no fraud vnto God, to deceiue the world in a lye for aduantage.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth also (because his right was litigious, &amp; another was in possession of the crowne) strengthened, or rather countenanced his title with the approbation of the people. But where you write, that at the Coronation of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> and Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the consent and acceptation of the people was demanded: First,
<pb facs="tcp:4088:57"/>
we haue no cause to credite any thing that you say; then, although it be true, yet not being done in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, it addeth no right vnto the Prince; but is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a formality, a circumstance only of ceremony and order.</p>
            <p>Hereupon you conclude, that a king hath his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, by agreement and contract betweene him &amp; the people: insinuating thereby that he looseth the same, if he either violate or neglect his word. The contrary opinion, that only succession of bloud ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a king, &amp; that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent of the people is nothing necessary, you affirme to be absurd, base and impious, an vnlearned, fond and wicked assertion; in flattery of Princes, to the manifest ruine of common-wealths, and peruerting of all law, order and reason.</p>
            <p>I did alwayes foresee that your impostumed sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke would belch forth some loathsome matter. But whosoeuer shall compare this confident conclusion with the proofes that you haue made, he will rather iudge you mad then vnwise. This bold blast, vpon grounds that are both foolish and false, bewrayeth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther want then weaknesse of wits. I am ashamed I should offer any further speech in so euident a truth: but since I haue vndertaken to combate an herisie, since the matter is of so great consequence &amp; import, I purpose once againe to giue you a gorge.</p>
            <p>Learne then, heauy-headed Cloisterer, vnable to mannage these mysteries of State: Learne of me, I say; for I owe this duty to all Christians: the Prophets, the Apostles, Christ himselfe hath taught vs, to be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to Princes, though both tyrants and infidels. This ought to stand with vs for a thousand reasons to

submit our selues to such kings, as it pleaseth God to send vnto vs; without either iudging or examining their qualities.Their hearts are in Gods hand; they do his seruice, sometimes in preseruing, sometimes in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing vs: they execute his iudgement both wayes, in the same measure which he doth prescribe. If they abuse any part of their power, we do not excuse, we do not extenuate it; we do not exempt them from their punishment: let them looke vnto it, let them assuredly expect, that God will dart his vengeance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a most stiffe and dreadfull arme. In the meane season, we must not oppose our selues, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then by humble sutes and prayers: acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, that those euils are alwayes iust for vs to suffer, which are many times vniust for them to do. If we do otherwise; if we breake into tumult and disorder, we resemble those Giants of whom the Poets write; who making offer to scale the skies, and to pul <hi>Iupiter</hi> out of his throne, were ouerwhelmed in a moment with the mountaines which they had heaped toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Beleeue it, Cloisterer; or aske any man who is both honest and wise, and he will tell you: It is a rule in reason, a triall in experience, an authority confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the best, that rebellion produceth more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible effects, then either the tyranny or insufficiency of any Prince.</p>

            <p>In breaking from this, you preferre succession of Princes before free election, as well for other respects, as for the preeminence of auncetrie in birth, which is so much priuiledged in the Scripture: and yet not made so inuiolable (you say) but vpon iust causes it might be inuerted; as it appeareth by the examples of <hi>Iacob, Iuda</hi> and <hi>Salomon.</hi> And this libertie you hold to be the principall remedie for such inconueniences as do ensue of the course of succession; as if the next in birth be vnable or pernicious to gouerne: in which cases, if he be not capable of directions and counsels, you affirme that the remedie is to remoue him. And so you make succession and election, the one to be a preseruatiue to the other; supposing, that the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of both are taken away: First, if ordinarily
<gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page missing〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:4088:59"/>
succession taketh place; then, if vpon occasion we giue allowance to election.</p>
            <p>For the prerogatiue of birth, as also for the speciall choice which God hath often made of the yongest, I will remit my selfe to that which I haue written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note n="g" place="margin">Cap. 1.</note>. At once: in those particular actions which God hath either done, or by expresse Oracle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, contrarie to the generall lawes which he hath giuen vs; as in the robberie of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> the extirpation of the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> the insurrection of <hi>Iehu,</hi> and such like; we are bound to the law, and not to the example. God hath giuen vs a naturall law, to preferre the first borne; he hath often made choice of the yongest, because he commonly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth greatest effects, by meanes not onely weake, but extraordinary; as it appeareth by the birth of <hi>Isaak.</hi> But that these speciall elections of God are not proposed for imitation to vs, hereby it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; because they haue bene for the most part, without defect in the one, or demerite in the other. And especially in this example of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi>; Saint <hi>Paule</hi> sayth <note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 9.13.</note> that it was not grounded vpon their workes, but vppon the will and pleasure of God; for before they had done good or euill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were borne, God sayd: <note n="i" place="margin">Gen 25.23.</note> 
               <hi>The eldest shall serue the youngest.</hi> Which if we might imitate, the priuiledge of birth were giuen in vaine.</p>
            <p>For your deuice in ioyning election to succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, whereby one of them should remedie the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the other, it is a meere vtopicall conceipt: what else shall I tearme it? an imposture of state, a dreame, an illusion, fit only to surprise the iudgement
<pb facs="tcp:4088:59"/>
of the weake and ignorant multitude. These toyes are alwaies hatched by the discoursiue sort of men, rather then the actiue; being matters more in imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation then in vse: and herein two respects do princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally oppose against you.</p>
            <p>The first is, for that in most nations of the world, the people haue lost all power of election; and succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is firmely setled in one discent, as before I haue declared <note n="k" place="margin">Cap. j.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The second is, for that more fierie factions are hereby kindled, then where succession or election are meere without mixture. For where one claimeth the Crowne by succession, and another possesseth it by ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of election; there, not a disunion onely of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not a diuision in armes, but a cruel throat-cutting, a most immortall and mercilesse butcherie doth vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ensue. It is somwhat inconuenient (I grant) to be gouerned by a Prince either impotent or euill; but it is a greater inconuenience, by making a breach into this high point of state, to open a way to all manner of ambitions, periuries, cruelties and spoile: whereto the nature of the common-people would giue a great furtherance, who being weake in wisedome, violent in will; soone wearie of quiet, alwaies desirous of chaunge, and most especially in matters of state, are easily made seruiceable to any mans aspiring de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires. This I haue manifested before <note n="l" place="margin">Cap. 3.</note>, by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of king <hi>Edward</hi> and king <hi>Richard,</hi> both surna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Second: who were not insupportable either in nature or in rule; &amp; yet the people more vpon wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnes then for any want, did take an vnbridled course against them. And thus is your high pollicie nothing
<pb facs="tcp:4088:60"/>
else but a deepe deceipt; thus whilest you striue with the wings of your wit to mount aboue the cloudes of other mens conceipt, you sinke into a sea of absurdities and errors.</p>
            <p>After this, you determine two questions; the first is, What respect is to be attributed to propinquitie of bloud onely. Whereto you answer, that it is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall circumstance which leadeth vs to the next suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the Crowne, if other circumstances and conditions doe concurre, which were appointed at the same time, when the lawe of succession was esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished. Assuredly you can neuer shewe either when, or by whome, this lawe of succession was first instituted, except perhappes by some <hi>Nimrod,</hi> when hee had brought the necke of a people vnder his sword: at which time, what conditions hee would set downe to bee required from his successour, any ordinarie iudgement may coniecture at ease. Well, since you set vs to seeke for proofe of this, to that which you haue written before, I will also send you backe to the same place <note n="m" place="margin">Cap j.</note> for your answer.</p>
            <p>The second question is, What interest a Prince hath to his kingdome, before he be crowned. This you resolue by certaine comparisons; and first you write, that it is the same which the Germaine Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour hath before his coronation. But that is so large, that some Emperours haue neuer bene crowned; others haue deferred it for many yeares; among which <note n="n" place="margin">Metrop. l. 3. cap. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Crantzius</hi> writeth, that <hi>Otho</hi> the first recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Crowne of the Empire, in the eight and twentieth yeare of his raigne. And yet is not this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison full to the question propounded; because in
<pb facs="tcp:4088:60"/>
electiue states there is not held one perpetuall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of royaltie, as is in those that are successiue. And <note n="o" place="margin">In Prooem. decret.</note> 
               <hi>Panormitane</hi> saith, That an argument <hi>a simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> is not good, if any difference can bee assigned. Much more vnfitly doe you affirme, that it is no greater then a Maior of London hath in his office, before hee hath taken his oath: for it is odiously ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, to compare the authoritie of an absolute Prince by succession, to the authoritie of an Officer, both electiue and also subiect.</p>
            <p>But it is the example of mariage (you say) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by this matter is made more plaine: for as in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract there is an espousall, by promise of a future act, and a perfect mariage by yeelding present consent; the first is, when both parties doe mutually promise that they will; the second, that they do take one the other for husband and wife: so an heire apparant, by propinquitie of bloud is espoused onely to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and maried afterward at his coronation, by oathes of either partie, and by putting on the ring, and other wedding garments. But how were Kings maried in former ages? how are they now maried in those countries, where they haue neither ring, nor wedding garment, nor also any oath? What? is euery office and degree which is taken with ceremonie, to be esteemed likewise a mariage? Or if you will haue coronation onely to bee a mariage, what else can it resemble, but the publike celebration of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie betweene man and woman? which addeth nothing to the substance of contract, but onely mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festeth it to the world.</p>
            <p>These pitifull proofes, naked of authoritie, emptie
<pb facs="tcp:4088:61"/>
of sence, deserue rather to be excused then answered: I will helpe therefore in some sort to excuse them. They are the best that your starued both cause and conceipt can possibly affoord: and you haue also some fellowes in your folly. <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> did solemnely ioyne the statues of the Sunne and of the Moone in mariage together. <hi>Nero</hi> was maried to a man, and tooke also a man to his wife. The Venetians doe yearely vpon Ascention day, by a ring and other ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, contract mariage with the sea.</p>
            <p>But now in earnest; men do dye whensoeuer it pleaseth God to call them: but it is a Maxime in the common law of England: <hi>Rex nunquam moritur; The king is alwaies actually in life.</hi> In Fraunce also the same custome hath bene obserued; and for more assurance it was expresly enacted vnder <note n="p" place="margin">About the yeare, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But so soone as the king departeth out of life, the royaltie is presently transferred to the next successor, according to the lawes and customes of our Realme.

            <p>He that knoweth not this, may (in regard of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of our state) ioyne himself to S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in his ignorance, &amp; professing that he knoweth nothing.

            <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> the first was in Palestina, when his father dyed; in which his absence, the Nobilitie and Prelates of the Realme assembled at London, and did acknowledge him for their king. In his returne home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, he did homage to the French king, for the lands which he held of him in France. He also repressed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine rebels of Gascoine; amongst whom, <hi>Gasco</hi> of Bierne, appealed to the court of the king of Fraunce: where king <hi>Edward</hi> had iudgement, that <hi>Gasco</hi> had committed treason <note n="d" place="margin">Walsingh. in E. 1.</note>; and therupon he was deliuered to the pleasure of king <hi>Edward.</hi> And this hapned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his coronation, which was a yeare and nine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4088:62"/>King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth was crowned in the eighth yeare of his raigne; and in the meane space, not onely his subiectes did both professe and beare alleageance, but the King of Scottes also did sweare homage vnto him.</p>
            <p>What neede I giue any more either instance or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, in that which is the cleare lawe, the vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulled custome of the Realme? Against which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding your weather-beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forehead doth not blush to oppose a blind opinion, that heires apparant are not true kings, although their titles be iust, and their predecessors dead. This you labour to prooue by a few drye coniectures, but especially and aboue all others (you say) because the Realme is asked three times at euery coronation, whether they will haue such a man to be their king or no. First, wee haue good reason to require better proofe of this question then your bare word: secondly, although we admit it to be true, yet seeing the aunswer is not made by the estates of the Realme assembled in parliament, but by a confused concurse (necessarie Officers excepted) of all sorts both of age and sexe, it is for ceremonie only, &amp; not of force, either to giue or to increase any right.</p>
            <p>Another of your arguments is, for that the Prince doth first sweare to gouerne well and iustly, before the subiects take their oath of alleageance; which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth, that before they were not bound. And further you affirme, that it happened onely to king <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, among his predecessors, to haue fealtie done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, before hee was crowned, and had taken his oath. I confesse indeed, that <hi>Polydore</hi> and <hi>St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:4088:62"/>
write not true; the one of them being a meere straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in our state; the other a man more to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for indeuour then for art. King <hi>Iohn</hi> being in Normandie when his brother dyed, sent into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland <hi>Hubert</hi> Archbishop of Canterburie, <hi>VVilliam Marshall</hi> Earle of Strigvile, and <hi>Geoffrie Fitzpeter</hi> Lord chiefe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ustice, who assembled the States of the Realme at Northhampton, and tooke of them an oath of obedience to the new king. Also king <note n="c" place="margin">Anno reg. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Henry</hi> the third caused the Citizens of London, the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of the Cinque-ports, and diuers others, to sweare fealtie to Prince <hi>Edward</hi> his sonne; who being in Palestina when his father died, the Nobilitie and Prelates of the Realme assembled in the new temple at London, and did acknowledge him for their king. And in like manner, king <hi>Edward</hi> the third tooke an oath of all the Nobilitie of the Realme, of faith after his death to <hi>Richard</hi> Prince of Wales: and so did king <hi>Henry</hi> the first, for his daughter <hi>Mawde,</hi> and her yong sonne <hi>Henry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the death of king <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects did often sweare alleageance, before the corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and oath of the king, you had neither counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance nor conscience to deny: but it was neither of these two which did restraine you; it proceeded one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the force of truth, which will manifest it selfe whatsoeuer art we vse to disguise it. For otherwise, what countenance, what conscience had you to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that it is expresly noted by our English Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers: That no alleageance is due vnto kings, before they bee crowned? Who are these Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers? where doe they so write? you that
<pb facs="tcp:4088:63"/>
search euery dustie corner of your braines, for a fewe ragged reasons to vphold your heresie, should not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue mentioned, or omitted such pregnant proofes: for in that you affirme, and do not expresse them, you condemne your selfe by your owne si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p>If you meane that which you alleadge out of <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi> and <hi>Stowe</hi>: That an oath of fealtie was neuer made before coronation, vntill the time of king <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth; it is neither true, nor to any such sence. If you meane that of <hi>Polydore</hi> in tearming <hi>Henry</hi> the fift, Prince and not King, before he was crowned; in writing also, that the States did consult in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note n="f" place="margin">De nouo rege creando more maio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> 
               <hi>of creating a new king after the custome of their auncestors</hi>: it is a sleepie ieast, to straine euery word in such an author to proprietie of speech. You might better haue cited, what certaine cities in Fraunce not long since alledged for themselues: That because they had not reputed <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth for their king, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had not professed alleageance vnto him, they were not to be adiudged rebels: whereupon notwithstanding the chiefest Lawyers of our age did resolue, that forasmuch as they were originall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, euen subiects by birth; they were rebels in bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring armes against their king, although they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer professed alleageance. And this is so euidently the lawe of the Realme, that it is presumption in vs both; in you, to assay by your shallow Sophistrie to obscure or impugne; in me, to indeuour by authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and arguments to manifest or defend the same.</p>
            <p>But the admission of the people (you say) hath often preuailed against right of succession. So haue
<pb facs="tcp:4088:63"/>
pyrates against merchants; so haue murtherers and theeues against true meaning trauellers. And this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty of the people hath moued diuerse kings to cause their sonnes to be crowned during their owne liues; because the vnsetled state of succeeding kings doth giue oportunitie to bouldest attempts; and not as you dreame, because admission is of more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance then succession.</p>
            <p>I will examine your examples in the Chapters fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. In the meane time where you write, that king <hi>Henry</hi> and king <hi>Edward,</hi> both called the Fourth, had no better way to appease their minds at the time of their death, but by founding their title vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the people; the Authors <note n="g" place="margin">Sir Tho. Moore, and Stow.</note> which you cite do plainely charge you with vnexcuseable vntruth. King <hi>Edward</hi> neuer made question of his right: king <hi>Henry</hi> did, as some other Authors report <note n="h" place="margin">Holing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shead.</note>; but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied no such deceiptfull comfort: this false skinne would not then serue to couer his wound.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>ERE you present your selfe very pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue to your audience, as though you had so ouer-strained your wits with store of examples of the next in succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion not admitted to the state, that you had cracked the creadite of them for euer. But you are worthy of blame, either for endangering or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling your selfe in matters of so small aduantage. I haue shewed before, that exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples suffice not to make any proofe; and yet herein doth consist the greatest shew of your strength. It is dangerous for men to be gouerned by examples though good, except they can assure themselues of the same concurrence of reasons, not onely in generall, but in particularities; of the same direction also and cariage in counsell; and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of the same fauourable fortune: but in actions which are euill, the imitation is commonly worse then the example. Your puffie discourse then is a heape of words without any waight; you make
<pb facs="tcp:4088:64"/>
mountaines, not of Mole-hils, but of moates; long haruest for a small deale, not of corne, but of cockle; and (as one sayd at the shearing of hogges) great crie for a little, and that not very fine wooll.</p>
            <p>Yea, but of necessitie something you must say: yea, but this something is no more then nothing. You suppose, that either your opinion will be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, more for authority of your person, then waight of your proofes; or else that any words will slide easily into the minds of those, who are lulled in the humour of the same inclination; because partialitie will not suffer men to discerne truth, being easily beguiled in things they desire. Besides, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer countenance you cary, that all your examples are free from exception, yet if you had cast out those which are impertinent, or vniust, or else vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, you could not haue beene ouer-charged with the rest.</p>
            <p>Your first example, that none of the children of <hi>Saule</hi> did succeede him in the crowne, is altogether impertinent: because by particular and expresse appointment of God <note n="i" place="margin">2. Reg 15. &amp; 16. 2 Reg. 2. &amp; 5.</note>, the kingdome was broken from his posteritie. We acknowledge that God is the onely superiour Iudge of supreme Kings, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing absolute both right and power, to dispose and transpose their estates as he please. Neither must we examine his actions by any course of law, because his will is aboue all law. He hath enioyned the people to be obedient to their Kings; he hath not made them equall in authoritie to himselfe. And whereas out of this example you deduce, that the fault of the father may preiudicate the sonnes right,
<pb facs="tcp:4088:65"/>
although he had no part in the fault; to speake mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately of you, your iudgement is either deceitfull or weake. God in his high Iustice, doth punish indeed the sinnes of parents vpon their posterity <note n="k" place="margin">Exod. 20.5.</note>: but for the ordinary course of humane iustice, he hath giuen a law, that the sonne shall not beare the iniquity of the father<note n="l" place="margin">Ezech. 18.20.

            <p>Your second example is of King <hi>Salomon,</hi> who succeeded in the state of <hi>Dauid</hi> his father, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he was his yongest sonne. But this example in many respects falleth not within the compasse of your case. First, because he was not appointed succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor by the people: we speake not what the king and the people may do to direct succession, but what the people may do alone. Secondly, for that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was not then stablished in succession. Lastly, for that the action was led by two Prophets, <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Nathan,</hi> according to the expresse choise and direction of God <note n="p" place="margin">1 Chron. 22.8.9.</note>: whereby it is no rule for ordinary right.</p>
            <p>Here many points do challenge you of indiscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the least. You write that <hi>Dauid</hi> made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to <hi>Bathsheba</hi> in his youth, that <hi>Salomon</hi> should succeed in his estate: but if you had considered at what yeares <hi>Salomon</hi> began to raigne, you should haue found, that <hi>Dauid</hi> could not make any such promise, but he must be a youth about threescore yeares of age. You write also, that <hi>Dauid</hi> adored his sonne <hi>Salomon</hi> from his bed: but the words where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Dauid</hi> worshipped were these <note n="q" place="margin">3. Reg. 2.48.</note>: <hi>Blessed be the
<pb facs="tcp:4088:65"/>
Lord God of Israel, who hath made one to sit on my throne this day, euen in my sight:</hi> whereby it is euident, that <hi>Dauid</hi> adored God and not his son. This I note rather for obseruation of the loosenesse of your iudgement, then for any thing it maketh to the purpose. You are so accustomed to vntruths, that you fall into them, without either aduantage or end.</p>
            <p>The like answer may be giuen to your example of <hi>Rehoboam</hi>; because God declared his sentence therein by two Prophets, <hi>Ahijah</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">3. Reg. 11.31.</note> and <hi>Shemaiah</hi> 
               <note n="s" place="margin">3. Reg. 12.24.</note>. But for that the ten tribes reuolted from <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment at his rough answer, and with dispite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Dauid</hi> and his house, and not in obedience to Gods decree, we cannot excuse them from offence, for which it turned to their destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For hereupon, first they were separated both from the place &amp; maner of the true worship of God; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there arose vnappeas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able war, betweene them &amp; the tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi>; then, insolencies following disorders, they were neuer long time free from conspiracies, diuisions and tumults: by which meanes being drained both of wealth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and reduced to a naked weaknesse, they were lastly caried captiue into diuerse farre countries, and strangers were sent to inhabite their cities.</p>
            <p>I must here also obserue a few of your interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, wherein your boldnesse is not limited with any bounds. It is to be noted (you say) that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Rehoboam</hi> went to <hi>Shechem</hi> to be admitted by the people, he was not accompted true King. I desire therefore that you would satisfie vs in these places following. Before <hi>Rehoboam</hi> went to <hi>Shechem,</hi> the Scripture saith, that <hi>Salomon</hi> died,
<gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page missing〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:4088:66"/>
and was buried, and <hi>Rehoboam</hi> his sonne raigned in his stead <note n="t" place="margin">3. Reg. 11.43.</note>. Againe, after the defection of the ten tribes it is sayd, that in the cities of <hi>Iudah Rehoboam</hi> did raigne still, <note n="u" place="margin">3. Reg. 12.17.</note> implying thereby, that in the other cities he raigned before. Againe, they are sayd to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled against the house of <hi>Dauid</hi> 
               <note n="w" place="margin">3. Reg. 12.19.</note>. And lastly, <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> raised all the strength of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Beniamin,</hi> to bring the kingdome againe vnto him <note n="x" place="margin">3. Reg. 12.21.</note>.</p>
            <p>Further you write, that ten tribes refused to admit <hi>Rehoboam</hi>; but the Scripture saith that they rebelled <note n="y" place="margin">3. Reg. 12.19.</note>. What? did God only allow hereof after it was done? did he only permit the people to do it? the Scripture testifieth that it was his decree, that it was his deed, and that he declared his will by <hi>Ahijah</hi> the Prophet <note n="z" place="margin">3. Reg. 11.31.</note>, during the life of <hi>Salomon,</hi> and for his sins. But these speciall warrants do not constitute a law; they serue onely to make good the particular actions for which they are directed, and not to iustifie another the like. Lastly, S. <hi>Paule</hi> saith, that all things happened to the Iewes in figure; vpon which place diuerse expositors haue noted, that the state of the Iewes was a figure of the Church of Christ: but that it was an example and patterne of all other states that should ensue, it shall be ranged among your cast conceipts.</p>
            <p>I refer me now to the iudgement of any man, who taketh not pleasure to beguile himselfe, whether you do not by art &amp; trumpery manifestly abuse vs; partly by incapacitie, &amp; partly by deceipt, either corrupting or confounding whatsoeuer you take in hand. Your humor both discontented and vnquiet, hath armed your mind with bloudy desires, which haue edged you on to put fewell to those slames, which you shold
<pb facs="tcp:4088:66"/>
endeuour to quench, though it were with your bloud.</p>
            <p>I will not stand vpon the particular examples of <hi>Spaine,</hi> as well for that the matter is both tedious and to litle purpose; as also for that we haue small confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie with the customes of that nation. Onely thus much in generall: We acknowledge that in auncient times the kingdome of <hi>Spaine</hi> was electiue, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your examples drawne from thence are nothing pertinent. The examples of later times, are both few and vniust, caried onely by faction and by force; as <hi>Garabay</hi> 
               <note n="&amp;" place="margin">Pa. 414.</note> testifieth of your example of <hi>Aurelio,</hi> and as by the example of D. <hi>Sancho el Brauo</hi> I haue declared before <note n="a" place="margin">Cap. 3.</note>. But you accompt faction to be the Common-wealth, and violence Iustice, when it may make to the furtherance of your affaires.</p>
            <p>The Historie of D. <hi>Berenguela</hi> I will briefly report, rather for the respect which guided the <hi>Castilians,</hi> then that I allow it for right which they did. <hi>Henry</hi> had two sisters, <hi>Donna Blanch</hi> the eldest, maried to <hi>Lewes</hi> the eight King of <hi>Fraunce</hi>; and <hi>Berenguela</hi> the yongest, maried to <hi>Alphonso</hi> king of <hi>Leon. Henry</hi> dying without issue, the <hi>Castilians</hi> feared, if they should submit themselues vnto <hi>Blanch,</hi> that their state, being lesse then the state of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> would be made a member thereof, and gouerned as a Prouince, and not as a kingdome. And therefore they did rather chuse to professe allegea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the Lady <hi>Berenguela</hi>; by which meanes, the kingdome of <hi>Leon</hi> was afterwards annexed vnto <hi>Castile,</hi> to the great encrease, both of dignitie and assurance to them both. I haue followed herein your owne Authors, not being ignorant that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb facs="tcp:4088:67"/>
of better name do write, that <hi>Berenguela</hi> was the eldest sister, as I shall haue occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hereafter to declare: but for the present let it be as you please; and let vs weigh our owne wisdomes, not only in straining, but in forging titles, to incurre those mischiefes, which the <hi>Castilians</hi> reiected, a lawfull title to auoid.</p>
            <p>And this was also one of the motiues of the reuolt of <hi>Portugale,</hi> which is your last example; although it had also (as <hi>Garabay</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Lib. 34. pa 833.</note> writeth) a concurrence of right. For <hi>Ferdinand</hi> king of <hi>Portugale,</hi> by his procurators, the Bishop of <hi>Ebora</hi> and others, did both contract and solemnize espousals with <hi>Elianor,</hi> daughter of <hi>Peter</hi> king of <hi>Aragon.</hi> But being entred into war with <hi>Henry</hi> king of <hi>Castile,</hi> &amp; finding himself at some disadua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage, he forsooke the king of <hi>Arrago<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> daughter, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tracted himself to <hi>Elianor,</hi> daughter to the king of <hi>Castile,</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very beneficiall conditions for his state. Afterward, falling into fancy with one of his subiects, named <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anor Telles de Meneses,</hi> wife to a noble man called <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo Vasques de Acun<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>a,</hi> he tooke her as his wife, and enforced her husband to auoid the Realme; &amp; had by her one only daughter, named <hi>Beatrix,</hi> who was ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in mariage to <hi>Iohn</hi> king of <hi>Castile.</hi> After the death of the king of <hi>Portugale</hi> her father, the king of <hi>Castile</hi> in the right of his wife, laid claime to that realme, &amp; was accordingly acknowledged by the chiefe of the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Prelats; and in particular, by <hi>D. Iohn</hi> maister of <hi>Auis,</hi> her fathers base brother, who was then the most forward man in her fauour. But afterwards falling into quarrell, and hauing slaine the Count <hi>de Oren,</hi> he stirred the people against the Queene, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled her to quit the city. And after diuerse outrages
<pb facs="tcp:4088:67"/>
and murthers, committed vpon the Bishop of Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, an Abbesse, and many others, hee was first made gouernour of Portugall; and then procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding further, in an assembly of his partie gathered at Coimbra, he was made King. <hi>Garrabay</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,<note n="c" place="margin">pa. 841.</note> that the chiefest obiection against <hi>Beatrix</hi> was, because her mother was not King <hi>Ferdinands</hi> law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wife. And I beleeue you also, that they had a reflexe, not to loose the dignitie of their kingdome (as now they haue done) and be made subiect to the cruell both auarice and ambition of a more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent state.</p>

            <p>The partition of the Realme of France between <hi>Charles</hi> the great, and <hi>Carlomon</hi> his younger brother, and also the vniting thereof againe in <hi>Charles,</hi> after the death of <hi>Carloman,</hi> depended vpon the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <hi>Pepin</hi> hauing dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed all things in his new Realme which hee thought necessarie for the suretie thereof, hee disposed his estate; leauing the Realme of Noion to his sonne <hi>Charles</hi>; and to <hi>Carloman</hi> his other sonne, that of Sois<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, &amp; that by the death of <hi>Carloman,</hi> both his place and his power did accrue vnto <hi>Charles.</hi> In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the first of a family, who hath attained a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, hath ordinarilye directed the succession thereof.</p>
            <p>The contention betweene <hi>Lewis le debonaire</hi> and his sonnes, according to your owne Author <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard,</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">De l'estate.</note> proceeded and succeeded after this manner. Certaine Lords of <hi>France</hi> taking discontentment at the immoderate fauours, which the king shewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Berard</hi> his great Chamberlaine, conspired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; and for their greater both counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and strength, drew his owne sonnes to bee of their faction. But <hi>Lewis</hi> brake this broile, more by foresight then by force; and doing execution vpon the principall offenders, pardoned his sonnes. Yet they, interpreting this lenitie to slacknes of courage, rebelled againe, gathered a greater strength, &amp; drew Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the fourth to bee a complice of their vnnaturall impietie: whereby it appeareth (saith <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard</hi>) that they are either foolish or mischieuous, who wil affirm, that euery thing is good which the Popes haue done. Afterward they tooke their father, vnder colour of good faith, and sent him prisoner to <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone,</hi> &amp; then at Compeigne assembled a Parliament,
<pb facs="tcp:4088:69"/>
composed of their owne confederates, wherin they made him a Monke, &amp; brought his estate into diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion &amp; share. It is easie to coniecture (saith the same <hi>Girard)</hi> what miserable conditions the Realme then endured; all lawes were subuerted, all things expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the rage of the sworde, the whole realme in combustion, and the people extreamely disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at this barbarous impietie. In the ende <hi>Lewes,</hi> by the aide of his faithfull seruants was taken out of prison, and restored to his kingdome; and his sonnes acknowledging their faulte, were receiued by him both to pardon and fauour. His sonne <hi>Pepin</hi> being dead, he diuided his Realme among his other three sonnes, <hi>Charles, Lewes,</hi> and <hi>Lothaire</hi>; but <hi>Lewes</hi> rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againe, and was again receiued to mercie: lastly, hee stirred a great part of Germanie to reuolt, with griefe whereof the good olde man his Father died. After his death, <hi>Lewes</hi> and <hi>Lothaire,</hi> vpon disdaine at the great portion which their Father had assigned to their brother <hi>Charles,</hi> raised warre against him. The battaile was giuen, wherein <hi>Charles</hi> remained victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, reducing them both vnder such conditions, as hee thought conuenient to impose. Loe heere one of your plaine and euident examples, which is so free from all exception.

               <hi>Loys le Begue,</hi> succeded after <hi>Charles,</hi> not as you affirme, by authoritie of the states, but (as in France at that time it was not vnusuall) by appointment of his father. And wheras you write, that <hi>Loys</hi> at his first entrance had like to haue bin depriued by the states,
<pb facs="tcp:4088:69"/>
but that calling a Parlament, he made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many faire promises to haue their good will; it is a very idle vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, as appeareth by the Author who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you auouch. At his death, he left his wife great with childe, who afterward was called <hi>Charles</hi> the simple. But before he had accomplished the age of 12. yeares, there stept vp in his place, first <hi>Loys</hi> and <hi>Carloman</hi> his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard brothers; then <hi>Charles</hi> surnamed <hi>le Gros</hi>; and after him <hi>Odo</hi> Earle of <hi>Paris.</hi> Then <hi>Charles</hi> the right heire attained the Crowne; and then againe were raised against him, first <hi>Robert,</hi> Earle of Angiers; and afterward <hi>Ralph</hi> king of <hi>Burgu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>die.</hi> But where you attribute these mutations to the authoritie of the states, <hi>Girard</hi> saith, that they were by faction &amp; vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of such, who fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the weaknes of their Prince, did make aduantage to their owne ambition; affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming plainly, that betweene the death of <hi>Loys le Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,</hi> &amp; <hi>Charles</hi> the simple, not one of them who held the crowne of the Realme was lawfull king <note n="g" place="margin">Di l'estate. lib. 1. pa. 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4088:70"/>Further, where you write, that <hi>William</hi> being a bastarde, succeeded <hi>Robert</hi> his Father in the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie of Normandie, notwithstanding the saide <hi>Robert</hi> left two brothers in life, it was at that time a custome in <hi>France,</hi> that bastards did succeed, euen as lawfull children. <hi>Thierry</hi> bastard of <hi>Clouis,</hi> had for his partage the kingdome of <hi>Austrasie,</hi> now called <hi>Lorraine.

            <p>Your examples of <hi>Lewes</hi> the 6. and <hi>Lewes</hi> the 11. are not worth a word in answere. In the beginning of their raigne, you affirme that they had like to haue beene disinherited by the state, for the offences of their Father. You beare a minde charged with thoughtes vaine, busie and bolde, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streint either of honestie or of discretion. For how
<pb facs="tcp:4088:70"/>
else could you here also affirme, that King <hi>Henry</hi> the third of England, was condemned by his Barons to be disinherited, for the fault of his Father? It is vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all with you in all your reports, either plainely to breake beyond the boundes of all truth, or grossely, (for I cannot now say artificially) to disguise it, with many false and deceiueable termes. But to conclude for the state of <hi>France,</hi> which is also to exclude what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer you haue said; vnder the raigne of <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, <note n="l" place="margin">1375.</note> for the better establishment of this right, and for cutting of those calamities which accompanie vsurpatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there was a lawe made, that after the death of any King, the eldest sonne should incontinently succeede.</p>
            <p>We are now come to our English examples, of which you might haue omitted those of the Saxon kings; as well for that there could be no setled forme of gouernment in those tumultuous times, as also for that our Histories of that age are very imperfect, not leading vs in the circumstances, either of the maner or occasion of particular actions: they declare in grosse what things were done, without further ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, either how or wherefore. But both these doe make for your aduantage: for who seeth not, that your exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples are chiefly bred in tempestuous times; and the obscuritie of Histories will serue for a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe to darken your deceit.</p>
            <p>Well, let vs take both the times and Histories as they are. How will you maintaine that <hi>Egbert</hi> was not next successour to <hi>Briticus</hi> by propinquitie of blood? <hi>Briticus</hi> left no children, and <hi>Egbert</hi> was des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended

               <note n="n" place="margin">De gest. Ang. lib. 1. ca. 2.</note> saith, that he was the only man aliue of the royall blood, being descended of <hi>Inegild,</hi> the brother of King <hi>Ina.</hi> How then is it true which you say, that <hi>Britricus</hi> was the last of the roial desce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? and if it had beene so indeede, the right of election should then haue bene in the state. And thus you stumble at euery step, you entangle your selfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out truth or ende. You snatch at the words of <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,</hi> where he saith; <hi>He is created king by consent of all</hi>: which doe imply no other sense, but that which a little after he saith; <hi>That he was saluted king by all.</hi> So we finde also, that the like improper speech was vsed at the coronatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Philip</hi> the second, king of <hi>France,</hi> whereby the Archbishop of <hi>Reimes</hi> did challenge power in the right of his Sea, to make election of the king.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Adelstane</hi> was illegitimate, you follow <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydore,</hi> a man of no great either industrie or iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>William Malmesbury</hi>

And in that you english these words of <hi>Polydore, Rex dicitur; Rex a populo salutatur; Hee was made king by the people</hi>: In that you affirme also, that for the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his valure hee was preferred before his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren which were lawfully borne, whome you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be men of most excellent both expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

            <p>
               <hi>Eldred</hi> did first take vpon him but as Protector, because of the minoritie of the sonnes of <hi>Edmund</hi> his elder brother; and afterward entred into ful pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the Crowne. But that his nephewes were put backe by the Realme, it is your owne idle inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it was no more the act of the realme, then was the vsurpation of King <hi>Richard</hi> the third.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Edwin</hi> was deposed from his estate, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusably vntrue. <hi>Polydore</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">Lib. 6.</note> writeth, that the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumbrians and Mercians not fully setled in subiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, made a reuolt. <hi>Malmesburie</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Lib. 2 ca. 8.</note> saith, that hee was maimed of a great part of his kingdome, by the stroke of which iniurie he ended his life. And whereas you write in commendation of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> his next successor, that he kept a Nauie of 6600. shippes for defence of the Realme, you discouer your defectiue iudgement in embracing such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports for true.</p>
            <p>In that you say, that many good men of the Realme were of opinion, not to admit the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Etheldred</hi> after the death of his brother, I dare confidently affirme, that you doe not only tel, but make an vntruth; hauing no author either to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse or countenance the same. In that you write al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, that betweene the death of <hi>Edmund Ironside,</hi> and the raigne of <hi>William</hi> Conquerour, it did plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare what interest the Common-wealth hath to alter titles of succession; it doth plainly appeare, that both your reason and your conscience is become slauish to your violent desire. For what either liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="tcp:4088:72"/>
or power had the Common-wealth vnder the barbarous rage and oppression of the Danes? when <hi>Canutus</hi> had spread the winges of his fortune ouer the whole Realme, none hauing either heart or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to oppose against him, what choise was then left vnto the people? what roome for right? what man not banished from sobrietie of sence woulde euer haue saide, that hee was admitted king by the whole Parliament and consent of the Realme? It is true, that after he had both violently and vniustly obtained full possession of the Realme, slaine the brother of <hi>Edmund Ironside,</hi> and conueied his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren into <hi>Sueden,</hi> he assembled the Nobilitie, and caused himselfe to be crowned king: but neither the forme nor name of a Parliament was then knowne in Englande; and if coronation were suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make a title, no king should be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to vsurpe.</p>
            <p>Of <hi>Harold</hi> the first, the naturall sonne of <hi>Canu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> our Histories doe verie differently report. <hi>Saxo Grammaticus</hi> writeth, that he was neuer king, but that he died before his Father. <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Huntington</hi> reporteth, that he was appointed but as Regent for his brother <hi>Hardicanutus.</hi> Others write, that appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the opportunitie of his brothers absence, he inuaded Northumberland and <hi>Mercia,</hi> by force of the Danes who were in Englande, wherevpon the Realme was diuided, one part holding for <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolde,</hi> and another for <hi>Hardicanutus,</hi> who was in Denmarke. But because hee delayed to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to England, they all fell, rather not to denie then to acknowledge <hi>Harold</hi> for their king. Take now
<pb facs="tcp:4088:72"/>
which of these reports you please, for all do serue to your purpose alike.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hardicanutus</hi> after the death of <hi>Harold,</hi> came out of Denmarke into Englande: and the people ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their courages broken with bondage, were easie to entertaine the strongest pretender. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death, diuers of the Nobilitie, especially <hi>Godwine</hi> Earle of Kent, rising into hope to shake off theyr shoulders the importable yoake of the Danes, aduaunced <hi>Edwarde</hi> the sonne of <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> to the Crowne, as being the next of the race of the Saxon Kings, though not in blood, yet at hand; for <hi>Edward</hi> the outlawe his elder brother, was then in Hungarie: and feare being the only knot that had fastened the people to the Danish Kings, that once vntied, they all scattered from them, like so many birdes whose cage had bene broken. <hi>Edward</hi> being dead, <hi>Harold</hi> the sonne of <hi>Godwine</hi> vsurped the kingdome: for as <hi>Malmesburie</hi> saith; <note n="r" place="margin">Extoria a principibus fide arripuit diadema.</note> 
               <hi>By extorted faith fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the nobilitie he fastned vpon the Crowne a forceable gripe: Henry Huntington</hi> also, and out of him <hi>Polydore</hi> doe write, that vpon confidence of his power he inuaded the Crowne <note n="s" place="margin">Viribus &amp; genere fretus regni Diade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma inuasit.</note>: which vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation gaue both encouragement and successe to the enterprise of the Normanes. This short pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of Historie you doe defile with so many vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes, that it seemeth you haue as naturall a gift to falsifie, as to eate, drinke, or sleepe.</p>
            <p>But where you write that <hi>William</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror formed any title by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent of the realme, you grow into the degree of ridiculous. We finde that he pretended the institution of king <hi>Edward,</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:4088:73"/>
had neither probabilitie norforce; and that he was nearer to him in blood, then <hi>Harold</hi> the vsurper: but that hee euer pretended the election of the people, it is your own clowted co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the English armie in the field, when hee had sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked their Townes, harried their Villages, slain much people, and bent his sworde against the brests of the rest, what free election could they then make? Your selfe acknowlede also in another place, <note n="t" place="margin">In part. 2. ca. 2. pa 12.</note> that hee came to the Crowne by dinte of sworde; and at his death his owne conscience constrained him to confesse, that hee tooke it without right <note n="u" place="margin">Lib. vit Will. conq.</note>. And in that the Pope and the French King fauoured his enterprise, it is not materiall, this was not the first iniustice which they haue assisted. Neither was it the Popes hallowed banner (as you affirme) but the bowe and the arrowe, the only weapon of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage long time after to this Nation, whereby hee did obtaine the victorie. One helpe hee had also within the Realme, for that King <hi>Edward</hi> had aduanced diuers Normans, to high place both of dignitie and charge; who gaue vnto him muche secret both incouragement and assistance in his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
            <p>And thus in all these turbulent times, you are so farre from finding fiue or sixe, that you are short of any one, who was made King by free authoritie of the people.</p>
            <p>King <hi>William Rufus</hi> made no other title to the Crowne, but the testament of his Father: For often vse hath confirmed it for lawe, that a Victor

            <p>But it is an idle vntruth that you write, that <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the first had no other title to the crowne, but the election of the people. He neuer was elected by the people; he neuer pretended any such title. <hi>Nubrigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi>

But <hi>Polydore</hi> saith <note n="f" place="margin">Lib. 15. pa. 263.</note>, that diuers noble men did account this to be a fraudulent iniustice, and therevpon did ominate those euils which afterward did ensue. And when the Archbishop was charged, that vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of reason, partly subborned, and partly weake, he had bene the occasion of all those mischiefes. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydore</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Pa, 269.</note> saith, that he was both grieued and ashamed at nothing more; <hi>Rog. Wenden</hi> affirmeth, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused himselfe, that he did it vpon oracles, and by the gift of prophesie.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Iohn</hi> hauing locked himselfe into the sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of state, made one wrong which he had done, to be the cause of a greater wrong; by murthering his Nephew, <hi>Arthur,</hi> Duke of <hi>Britane,</hi> whose inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he did vniustly vsurpe. For this fact the French king depriued him of all the landes which he helde in fee of the crowne of <hi>France,</hi> &amp; prosecuted the sentence
<pb facs="tcp:4088:77"/>
to effect. After this, as men are easily imboldened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst an vsurper, when once he declineth eyther in reputation or in state, diuers of the Nobilitie, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they of the North, confederated against him: but being neither able to endure his warre, nor wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to repose trust in his peace, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tracted with <hi>Lewis</hi> the French kings sonne, to take vpon him to be their king. And so it often happeneth in ciuill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, that they who are weakest, do runne with a naturall rashnesse to call in a third.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lewes</hi> being arriued vpon the coast of Kent, the Nobilitie of that faction <note n="h" place="margin">Walsing. hypodigm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ome for company, ioyned to the reuolt. Hereof a lamentable presence of all miseries did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise, whereby as well the libertie as the dignitie of the Realme, were brought to a neare and narrowe iumpe. The poore people, naked both of helpe and hope, stood at the curtesie and pleasure of the men of armes; the libertie of warre making all things lawfull to the furie of the strongest. The Nobilitie, feeling much, and fearing more the insolencie of the French Natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who (as Vicount <hi>Melin</hi> a noble ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of France confessed at his death) had sworne the extirpation of all the noble bloud in the Realme, began to deuise, how they might returne into the alleageance of king <hi>Iohn</hi>: in so much as a litle before his death, Letters were b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But after his death, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily did happen within fiue moneths after the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall of the French, both their hatred and their feare
<pb facs="tcp:4088:78"/>
being at an ende, they were all as readie to cast out <hi>Lewes,</hi> as they had bene rash to call him in.</p>
            <p>This History you corrupt with verie many odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vntruthes, which are more harsh to a well tuned eare, then the crashing of teeth, or the grating of cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. As namely in affirming, that <hi>Arthur</hi> was exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and <hi>Iohn</hi> crowned King by the states of the Realme; that God did more defend this act of the Common-wealth, then the iust title of <hi>Arthur</hi>; that by the same states, king <hi>Iohn</hi> was reiected, Prince <hi>He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> his sonne depriued, and <hi>Lewes</hi> of <hi>France</hi> chosen to be king; that the same states recalled their sentence against Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> disanulling their oathe and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageance made vnto <hi>Lewes.</hi> A shamelesse tongue, gouerned by a deceitfull minde, can easily call, facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Common wealth; rebellion, a iust and iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall proceeding; open an often periurie, an orderly reuoking of a sentence; Gods secret iudgement in permitting iniustice to preuaile, a plain defence and allowance thereof.</p>
            <p>Of the diuision of the houses of Lancastar and Yorke, it is but little that you write, whereto I haue fully answered before: you do wisely to giue a light touch to this example, it is so hotte that it will scalde your throate. King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, more caried by cursed ambition, then either by necessitie or right, laide an vniust gripe vpon the Realme, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he did beautifie with the counterfeit titles of conquest and election. So violent are the desires of Princes to imbrace streined titles, by whiche they may disturbe the states of other; not remembring, that right may be troaden downe, but not troaden out; hauing her secret both meanes to support, and
<pb facs="tcp:4088:78"/>
seasons to reuiue her. For although the lawfull suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor did warily strike saile to the tempest, because neither the time running, nor the opportunitie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent (which are the guiders of actions) did consent as then to enter into enterprise. Yet so soone as one heare of occasion was offered, his progenie did set vp a most doubtfull warre, wherein thirteene bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes were executed by English-men only, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue fourescore Princes of the royall blood slaine.</p>
            <p>Loe now the smiling successe of these vsurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; loe what a deare purchase of repentance they did cause! Were it not that passion doth blind men, not only in desire but in hope, they might suffice to make vs aduised, to keepe rather the knowne &amp; bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten way with safetie, then vpon euery giddie and brainlesse warrant to engulphe our selues in those passages, wherein so many haue perished before vs. It belongeth to wise men to auoide mischies; and it is the reward of fooles to lament them.</p>
            <p>Goe too then, conclude if you please that the people are not bound to admit him to the Crowne, who is the next successor by propinquitie of blood; but rather to weigh, whether it is like that hee will performe his charge, or no. Conclude this (I say) to be your opinion; and that it seemeth to you to be conforme to all reason, lawe, religion, pietie, wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and policie, and to the custome of all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealthes in the world: and I wil assuredly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude against you, that you prate without either warrant or weight.</p>

            <head>To the ninth Chapter, which beareth title,VVhat are the principall points which a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth ought to respect in admitting or exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any Prince, wherein is handled largely also, of the diuersitie of religions, and other such causes.</head>
            <p>IN this passage you handle what cause is sufficient, either to keepe in, or to cast the next in blood out of state. In which question you determine, that God doth allowe for a iust and sufficient cause, the will &amp; iudgement of the people. Your reason is, for that they are the iudge of the thing it selfe, and therefore they are the iudge also of the cause. Your antecedent you proue; First, for that it is in their owne affaire; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for that it is in a matter that hath his whole beginning, continuance and substance from them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. Your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequence you proue by a whole lump of lawe, in alleaging the entire bodie of the ciuil and Canon lawe, assisted also with great reason.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diogenes</hi> said of a certain Tumbler, that he neuer sawe man take more paines to breake his necke. In like sort we may say of you; It is hard to finde a man that hath more busied his wittes, to ouerthrow the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his wisedome. For the first proofe of your antecede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, is not only of no force for you, but strong against you; because no man is a competent iudge in his owne cause; no man can bee both partie and iudge: whereto I wil adde, that no inferiour hath iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction ouer the superiour, much lesse the subiect against the Soueraigne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4088:80"/>Your second proofe, that all the power of a King hath dependency vpon the people, I haue sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encountred before <note n="h" place="margin">Ca. 1.</note>. And if your consequence were true, that whosoeuer is iudge of a thing, is iudg also without controwlment of the cause; if this were as agreeable to all lawes as you make countenance, then were all iudgements arbitrarie; then could no appeale be enterposed, for giuing sentence without iust cause; then were it false which <hi>Panormitane</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <note n="l" place="margin">In e per tuas. Qui fil. sunt legit.</note>, that a false cause expressed in a sentence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it voide.</p>
            <p>What shall I say? what doe you thinke? doe you think that these fat drops of a greasie brain, can bring the tenure of a crown to the wil of the people? what are you who endeuour thus boldly to abuse both our iudgement &amp; conscience? Are you religious? are you of ciuil either nature or education, who vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Ciuilian do open the way to all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of deceits, periuries, tumults &amp; treasons? What are you? For you shewe your selfe more prophane then Infidels; more barbarous then Caniballs, Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians, Moores &amp; Mammelucks; who though they beare themselues in nothing more then hatred and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt, yet do they both loue &amp; honor their kings. I see what you are, the very true follower of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptists in Garmanie, who openly professed, that they must ruinate the state of kings. And who can as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure vs (for your corrupt dealing make all suspitions credible) that you doe not also follow them both in desire and hope, to imbrace the Monarchy of the whole world. The difference betweene you is this: they pretended reuelation for their warrant: you worke by deceitfull shewe of reason, by falsly either
<pb facs="tcp:4088:81"/>
alleaging, or wresting, or corrupting both humane and diuine authoritie.</p>
            <p>In what miserable condition should Princes liue, if their slate depended vpon the pleasure of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in whom company taketh away shame, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man may laie the fault on his fellow? How could they commaund? who would obey? what could they safely either doe or omit? Who knowes a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that knoweth not, that suddain opinion maketh them hope, which if it be not presently answered, they fall into hate? choosing and refusing, erecting and ouerthrowing, as euery winde of passion doth puffe. What staiednesse in their will or desire? which hauing so many circles of imagination, can neuer be enclosed in one point.</p>
            <p>And whereas you write, that God alwaies appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the will and iudgement of the people, as being properly the iudge of the whole businesse; and that euery particular man must simply submit himselfe therevnto, without further inquisition, although at diuers times they determine contraries, (as they did betweene the houses of Lancaster and Yorke) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we must presume that they were ledde by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent respects. You seeme not obscurely to erect thereby another priuiledged power vppon earth; which cannot erre, which doth not deceiue.</p>
            <p>But it may be some honest minded man will say, that howsoeuer you write, your meaning was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise; you write also afterward, that in two cases euery priuate man is bounde to resist the iudgement of the whole people, to the vttermost extent of his abilitie. Well then, let vs take you for a man, whose sayings disagree, both from your meaning, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<pb facs="tcp:4088:81"/>
themselues: let vs consider what are your two exceptions.</p>
            <p>The first is when the matter is carried, not by way of orderly iudgement, but by particular faction of priuate men, who will make offer to determine the cause, without authoritie of the Realme committed vnto them. But this exception is so large, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth the whole rule: for in actions of this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, the originall is alwaies by faction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment by force, or at least by feare, howsoeuer they are sometimes countenanced with authoritie of the state. So <hi>Sylla,</hi> hauing brought his legions within the walles of <hi>Rome,</hi> obteined the lawe <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leria</hi> to be published, whereby he was created <hi>Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator</hi> for 24. yeares: by meanes of which force, <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> affirmeth <note n="m" place="margin">Lib. de le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus.</note> that it was no lawe. Likewise <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Medices,</hi> hauing an armie within Florence, caused, or rather constrained the Citizens to elect him Duke. When <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth was chosen king, ho held fortie thousand men in Armes. And this is most euident by your owne example, of foure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary actes of Parliament which at diuers times were made, during the contention betweene the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of <hi>Lancastar</hi> and <hi>Yorke,</hi> not vpon different rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as with little reason you affirme, but vpon dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent successe of either side.</p>
            <p>In matters of this moment, the orderly course of proceeding is onely by Parliament. The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament must bee summoned by the Kings vvrit, and no act thereof hath life, But by expresse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the King. If this forme had alvvayes beene obserued, neyther our Kinges should haue beene deposed, nor the next successours excluded,
<pb facs="tcp:4088:82"/>
nor the title of the crowne entangled, to the inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable both weakning &amp; waste of all the Realme.</p>
            <p>Your second exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, when such a man is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the crowne, by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God is manifestly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, &amp; the realme preiudiced or endangered: in which case (you say) euery man, with a free and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trowled conscience, may resist what he can.</p>
            <p>It was euen here I looked for you. Your broyling spirits do nothing else but fling firebrands, &amp; heape on wood, to set kingdomes in combustio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, what reuolt hath euer bin made, but vnder some of these pretenses? what Princes actions, either by malicious or ignorant interpretation, may not easily be drawen to one of these heades? you are a nursery of war in the common-wealth: a Seminary of schisme &amp; diuisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the church: In sum, all your actions, all your thoughts are barbarous &amp; bloody.</p>
            <p>You write much of right &amp; iustice, but you mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the right &amp; iustice of a cause, by the aduantage of your owne affaires. You speak as hauing a tender touch of the glorie of God; but you stretch out your throate with high wordes of contradiction against him. You make shew of care to pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erue the state, but you are like the Iuy, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eemeth outwardly both to imbrace and adorne the wall, whereinto inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it doth both eate &amp; vndermine. For what meanes either more readie or forceable to ouerthrow a state, then faction and intestine quarels? and what other milke doe you yeelde? what are your opinions? what your exhortations? but either to set, or to holde vp sedition and bloodshead? Saint <hi>Paule</hi> teacheth vs not to resist higher powers <note n="n" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.</note>, although both cruel and prophane; you teach vs to resist them
<pb facs="tcp:4088:82"/>
what we can: the Apostle is followed of al the aunti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers of the church; you are followed of those only who follow the Anabaptists. For my part, I had rather erre with the Apostle in this opposition, then holde truth with you. But I will speake more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately in a subiect of such nature; I wil not say the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that I had rather erre, but that I shall lesse feare to erre in not resisting with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostle, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in resisting with you. New councels are alwaies more plausible then safe.</p>
            <p>After you haue plaide the <hi>Suffenus</hi> with your selfe, in setting the garland vpon your owne head, and making your imaginarie audience to applaude your opinion, as worshipfully wise, you proceede to declare what ought chiefly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o be regarded, in furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or hindering any Prince towards the Crowne. Three points (you say) are to bee required in euerie Prince, religion, chiualrie and iustice; and putting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the two last, as both handled by others, and of least importance, you assume onely to treate of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; wherein, eyther errour or want doth bring inestimable damage to any state.</p>
            <p>You drawe along discourse, that the highest end of euery Common-wealth, is the seruice &amp; worship of God; and consequently, that the care of religion is the principall charge which pertaineth to a King. And therfore you conclude, that whatsoeuer prince doth not assist his subiects to attaine this ende, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the chief part of his charge, &amp; committeth high treason against his Lord, and is not fit to holde that dignitie, though he performe the other two partes neuer so well. And that no cause can to iustly cleare the conscience, whether of the people, or of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men, in resisting the entrance of any Prince, as if
<pb facs="tcp:4088:83"/>
they iudge him faultie in religion.</p>
            <p>This is neither nothing, nor all which you say. In electiue states, the people ought not to admit any man for King, who is eyther colde or corrupt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; but if they haue admitted such a one with so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne authoritie, they haue no power at pleasure to remoue him. In successiue kingdomes wherein the people haue no right of election, it is not lawfull for priuate men vpon this cause to offer to impeach, either the entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance of that king, which the lawes of the State do present vnto them: not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because it is forbidden of God (for that is the least part of your regard) but because disorderly distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of a setled forme in gouernment, traineth after it more both impieties and dangers, then hath euer ensued the imperfections of a king.</p>
            <p>I will come more close to the point in controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and dispell these foggie reasons which stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene your eye and the truth. There are two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall parts of the lawe of God; the one morall or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, which containeth three points; sobrietie in our selues, iustice towards others, and generally also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence and pietie towards God: the other is super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall; which containeth the true faith of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of our saluation, and the speciall kind of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship that God doth require. The first, God hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by the ministrie of nature to all men; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond he doth partly reueale, &amp; partly enspire to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he please: and therefore although most nations haue in some sort obserued the one, yet haue they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly erred, but failed in the other.</p>
            <p>During the time of the lawe, this peculiar worship of God was appropriate only to the people of <hi>Israel,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:4088:83"/>
in a corner kingdome of the world: the flourishing Empires of the Assirians, Medes, Persians, Aegyptia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, Graecians, Syrians and Romans, eyther knew it not, or held it in contempt. The Israelites were almost al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in subiection vnder these both Heathen &amp; ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall gouernments; &amp; yet God by his Prophets enioyned them obedience; affirming, that the hearts of kings were in his hands; &amp; that they were, the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of his iustice, the executioners of his decrees.</p>
            <p>In the time of grace, the true mysteries both of worship and beliefe, were imparted also to other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but the ordinarie meanes to propagate the same, was neither by policie, nor by power. When S. <hi>Peter</hi> offered prouident counsell (as hee thought) vnto Christ, aduising him to haue care of himselfe, and not to go to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> where the Iewes sought to put him to death, Christ did sharply reproue him for it <note n="o" place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 16.25.</note>: when he did drawe his sword, and therwith also drew bloud in defence of Christ, hee heard this sentence; <note n="p" place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 26.52.</note> 
               <hi>They that take the sworde shall perish with the sworde.</hi> Christ armed his Apostles onely with firie tongues <note n="q" place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 2.3.</note>; by force whereof they maintained the fielde, against all the stratagems and strength in the world. And when Princes did, not onely reiect but persecute their doctrine; they taught their subiects obedience vnto them <note n="r" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</note>, they did both encounter and ouercome them, not by resisting, but by persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting and enduring.</p>
            <p>This course seemeth straunge to the discourse of of reason, to plant religion vnder the obedience of kings, not only carelesse therof, but cruell against it: but when we consider that the Iewes did common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forsake God in prosperitie, and seeke him in
<pb facs="tcp:4088:84"/>
distresse; that the Church of Christ was more pure, more zealous, more entire, I might also say more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, when shee trauelled with the storme in her face, then when the winde was eyther prosperous or calme; that as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith <note place="margin">Contra Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tihanum.</note>, <hi>Want or weakenesse of faith is vsually chastised with the scourges of tribulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi>; We may learne thereby no further to examine, but to admire and embrace the vnsearchable wisedome and will of God.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore that this is appointed the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie meanes, both to establish and encrease religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, may we aduenture to exchange it with humane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices? Is it the seruants dutie eyther to contradict or dispute the maisters commaundement? is there any more readie way to proue an heretike, then in being a curious questionist with God? is hee bounde to yeelde to any man a reason of his will? It is more then presumption, it is plaine rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to oppose our reason against his order, against his decree.</p>
            <p>It standeth also vpon common rules: <hi>That which is contrary to the nature of a thing doth not helpe to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, but to destroy it: It is foolish to adde externall stay, to that which is sufficient to support it selfe: It is sencelesse to attempt that by force, which no force is able to effect: That which hath a proper rule, must not be directed by any other.</hi> And this was both the profession and practise of the auntient Fathers of the Church, as I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before <note n="t" place="margin">Ca. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

were neuer followed, but they haue made way for all miseries and mischiefes to range in, to come for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to thriue, to preuaile.

For most cowardly companions may set vp striefe; but it is maintained with the hazard, and ended with the ruine, alwayes of the worthiest, and sometimes of all.</p>
            <p>The summe is this. So long as we expresse pure pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, both in our doctrine and in our doings; all will goe well; but when we make a mixture of deuine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane both wisedome and power; when we preach po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie: when we make a common trade of treason; when we put no difference betweene conscience and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite; we must needes ouerthrow, either religion or our selues.</p>
            <p>Now I will answere the reasons of your assertion. First you say, that if Princes doe not assist their subiects in the honour and seruice of God in this life, God should drawe no other fruite or commodity from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane societies, then of an assembly of brutish creatures. But this reason is not onely weake, as it may appeare by that which hath beene saide, but also brutish, and (which is worse) prophane. For what fruite, what commoditie doeth God drawe from societies of men? is not his glory perfect in it selfe? can we adde any thing to the excellencie thereof? hath he any neede of our broken worship? God is an absolute beeing, both comprehending, and exceeding all perfections: an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite being, and therefore his sufficiencies neither can be encreased, neither doe depend vpon any, but onely of himselfe. He was from eternity without any world,
<pb facs="tcp:4088:85"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd a thousand worldes more cannot any deale en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease his felicity and glory: he did create the world, not to perticipate any thing thereof, but to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate from himselfe vnto it. Heereupon <hi>Iob</hi> saith <note n="g" place="margin">22.5.</note>. <hi>What profit is it to God if thou be iust? What aduantage is it to him if thy wayes bee cleane?</hi> Surelie we must be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enformed of the soundnesse of your iudgement, before we dare depend vppon the authority of your worde.</p>
            <p>You put vs in minde that you compared an heire apparant to a spouse, betroathed onely and not maried to the common wealth. I remember it well; but I did not take you for such a widower of wit, that you could thinke it worthy to be repeated. And yet that which herevpon you deduce out of <hi>S. Paul</hi> maketh altogether against you. <hi>S. Paul</hi> saith <note n="h" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</note>, that if a brother hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidell to wife, if the consent to abide with him, he may not put her away: and likewise if a woman hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidell husband: but if the infidell doeth depart, then the Christian is free. Now if you will needes make a marriage betweene a King and his subiects, you might heereupon conclude, that if an infidell King will houlde his state, the people may not dispossesse him.</p>
            <p>And whereas you affirme, that all they who dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in any point of religion, and stand wilfully in the same, are infidelles the one to the other, you shew both a violence and weakenesse of minde. For obstinate error in certaine articles of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith, and not in the whole state and substance thereof, doth make an hereticke, but not an Infidell. And although the Canon lawe dooth in some case dissolue mariage betweene a Christian
<pb facs="tcp:4088:86"/>
and an Infidell <note n="i" place="margin">c. iudaei. 28. q. 1. c. quanto. de diuor.</note>; yet doth it not permit the like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a true Christian and an heretick <note n="k" place="margin">d. c. qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to c. gaudemus de diuort.</note>.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ison for good, yet in case of infidelitie, <hi>S. Paule</hi>; in case of heresie, the Cannon lawe is altogether against you.</p>
            <p>You adde, that albeit the religion which a man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth be neuer so true, yet whosoeuer hath a contrary perswasion thereof, he shall sinne damnably in the sight of God, to preferre that man to a charge, wherein he may drawe others to his opinion. But I will omit this streine, and yet rather as impertinent then true. For there are few nations in the world, wherein the people haue right to prefer any man to be king: &amp; that which you alleage out of <hi>S. Paule</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.</note> for your proofe, is very different from the case which you do forme. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speaketh when an action is of it selfe indifferent, but a weake conscience iudgeth it euill; being also euill by circumstance, in offending others: you speake where an action is good in it selfe, but an erronious conscience iudgeth it euill. I allowe, that a good action contrarie to conscience is vnprofitable; but that it is alwayes a damnable sinne I dare not affirme. I dare not affirme that the Romane armie did damnably sinne, in defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Empire to <hi>Iouinian</hi>; who excusing himselfe, (as <hi>Zona<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>as</hi> wrighteth) because being a Christian he could not command a Pagane armie, they did not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding confirme him Emperour, by which means they did afterward embrace the Christian faith. The like doth <hi>Orosius</hi> report, that <hi>Valentinian,</hi> being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by <hi>Iulian</hi> from being Tribune, because he was a Christian, by consent of the Souldiers was created
<pb facs="tcp:4088:86"/>
               <hi>Augustus.</hi> I rather take it to be a damnable sinne, which <hi>Zonaras</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">to. 3.</note> wrighteth of the Bulgarians, in taking armes against their King, because he was conuerted to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian religion; albeit they did according to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. It were a deflowring of time to diue into the depth of this question; because it appe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>teineth to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectiue states, and not vnto vs. But where you wright, without eyther authoritie or proofe, that to assist, or not to resist the aduancement or gouernment of any king, whom we iudge faultie in religion, is a most damnable sinne, of what side soeuer the truth be; you breath out most filthy and vnsauorie smoake; you lift vp your voice into high blasts of blasphemie, against the most high.</p>
            <p>God hath taught by the Apostle <hi>S. Paule</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.</note>, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer resist the higher powers (which at that time were Infidels) receiue vnto themselues damnation; you teach, that whosoeuer doth not in the like case resist, doth damnably offend. Were not the spirit of diuision, otherwise called the deuill seated in your soule, you would not thus openly oppose the setlings of your rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten braine, against the expresse and direct sentence of God. What? is it a damnable sinne to doe euery man right? is it damnable to giue <hi>Caesar</hi> that which is his due <note n="q" place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 22 17. <hi>Mar.</hi> 12.17. <hi>Luc.</hi> 20.25.</note>? to giue tribute, honor, feare, to whom they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine <note n="r" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 13 7</note>? The Apostle saith, that Christians by resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the power of Infidell rulers, do acquire vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues damnation <note n="s" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2</note>: and shall wee yeelde credit vnto you, that Turkes, Moores, Infidels, should damnablye sinne, eyther in admitting or enduring the authoritie of a Christian Prince? How vilie doe you value the iudgements of men? at how lowe rate doe you prize both your conscience and credit? I could rise into riot
<pb facs="tcp:4088:87"/>
of wordes vpon you, were it not that I respect what is seemlye, rather for mee to speake then for you to heare.</p>
            <p>Certainely, if we had receiued no such commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement from God, the regarde of the quiet of humane societies is sufficient to ouer-whelme your hereticall assertion: for seeing there are many different professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of religion, not onely in the world, but almost in euery nation of the world: seeing also (as <hi>Philo</hi> saith <note n="t" place="margin">De legat.</note>) euery man, eyther by vse or instruction iudgeth his owne religion best: what suretie could any Prince, what safetie could any people enioy, if your firie opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should take place? what assurance can there be of life or of state, where the sworde beareth swaye vpon such occasions, &amp; that guided by hands both tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and fierce. And seeing among many religions there can be but one truth, if all men should be obstinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie bent against the gouernment of any, who in their iudgement is faultie in religion; what likelyhood can we eyther conceiue or coniecture, but that many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours would soone preuaile against the onely trueth. And therefore it is farre more moderate and safe, to vse the ordinarie meanes both of maintaining and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating the trueth, and to commit the successe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vnto God; and (as <hi>Iosephus</hi> aduiseth) not to offer eyther contumelie or violence against any religion, least we prouoake thereby the professors thereof to doe the like against our.</p>
            <p>Your last reason is drawne from policie and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of state; because a King will neyther trust nor fauour, much lesse aduance him, that is not of the same religion with himselfe: but to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, hee shall bee subiect to all molestations, iniuries
<pb facs="tcp:4088:87"/>
and other auersions, which are incident to those who are not currant with the present course of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires.</p>
            <p>Oh sirre; this is the <hi>Helene</hi> for which you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; you concurre in opinion with those <hi>Athenians</hi> of whome <hi>Alexander</hi> demanded deuine honours; not so obstinately to defend heauen, as to loose the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the earth. This is the marke whereat you aime, this is the Compasse whereby you sayle; as diuers flowers doe open and cloase, according to the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the same; so according to the variation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, you extend or restraine your plyant conscience as you please.</p>
            <p>But the Apostle teacheth vs to be obedient to high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er powers, for conscience sake <note n="u" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.5</note>, and not for anye priuate respect.</p>
            <p>Besides, all Princes are not of that disposition whereof you speake. <hi>Suida</hi> wrighteth of one, who changing religion to please his King, was therefore adiudged to loose his head; one being appointed to crye at the time of his execution; <hi>Hee that keepeth not faith with God, what sound conscience can hee beare towards men?</hi> The Protestants in France are not altogether cast eyther out of fauoure or out of charge: and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Romane Catholickes in England, doe enioye their full part, of all the plentie and pleasures that the realme can affoord.</p>
            <p>Lastly, what haue you to doe with reasons of state? This is the Eagles feather which consumeth your deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
