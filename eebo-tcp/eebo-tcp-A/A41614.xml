            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Father of Lies</hi> is the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>Mis-representing.</hi> He first made the Experiment of this <hi>Black Art</hi> in Paradise; having no surer way of bringing God's <hi>Precept</hi> into Contempt, and making our <hi>First Parents</hi> transgress, than by <hi>mis-representing</hi> the <hi>Command,</hi> which their <hi>Maker</hi> had laid upon them. And so unhappily successful he was in this his first attempt, that this has been his chief stratagem ever since, in all business of difficulty and concern: esteeming That his best <hi>Means</hi> for preserving and propagating Wickedness amongst Men, by which he first won them to lose their Innocence. And therefore there has nothing of <hi>Good</hi> yet come into the World, nothing been sent from Heaven, but what
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60203:3"/>
has met with this Opposition; the Common Enemy having imploy'd all his Endeavours of bringing it into discredit, and rendring it infamous, by <hi>mis-representing.</hi> Of this there are frequent instances in the <hi>Old Law,</hi> and more in the <hi>New.</hi> The truth of it was experienc'd on the <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> himself, who, tho' he was the <hi>Son of God,</hi> the <hi>immaculate Lamb,</hi> yet was he not out of the reach of <hi>Calumny,</hi> and exempt from being <hi>mis-represented.</hi> See how he was painted by malicious Men, the Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> Ministers of <hi>Satan; a prophane and wicked Man, a breaker of the Sabbath, a Glutton, a Friend and Companion of Publicans and Sinners, a Fool, a Conjurer, a Traytor, a Seducer, a tumultuous Person, a Samaritan, full of the Devil; he hath Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub, and by the Prince of the Devils, casteth he out Devils, (Mark</hi> 3.22.) There being no other way of frighting the People from embracing the <hi>Truth,</hi> following the Son of God, but by thus disfiguring him to the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, reporting Light to be Darkness, and God to be the Devil. The Disciples of Christ every where met with the like encounters. <hi>Stephen</hi> had the people stirred up against him, because they <hi>heard he had spoke blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous words against</hi> Moses, <hi>and against God, (Acts</hi> 6.11.) <hi>Paul</hi> also and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> for <hi>exceedingly troubling the City, (Acts</hi> 16.20.) <hi>Iason</hi> also with them, because he had <hi>turned the World upside down, and did contrary to the Decrees of</hi> Caesar, <hi>(Acts</hi> 17.6, 7.) <hi>Paul</hi> again, because he did <hi>teach all men every where against the people, and polluted the holy place, (Acts</hi> 21.28.) And because he was <hi>a pestilent fellow, and a mover of Sedition among all the Iews through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World:</hi> to which the <hi>Iews also assented, saying that these things were so, (Acts</hi> 24.5, 9) Neither did these <hi>Calumnies,</hi> these wicked <hi>Mis-repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations</hi> stop here; he that said, <hi>The Disciple is not above his Master, if they have called the Master of the House Belzebub; how much more shall they call them of his Houshold?</hi> did not only foretell what was to happen to his <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers</hi> then present, but also to the <hi>Faithful</hi> that were to succeed them, and to his <hi>Church</hi> in future ages, they being all to expect the like Fate; that tho' they should be never so just to God and their Neighbour, upright in their ways, and live in the Fear of God, and the Observance of his Laws; yet must they certainly be <hi>reviled</hi> and <hi>hated</hi> by the World, made a <hi>by-word</hi> to the people, and have the repute of <hi>Ideots, Seducers,</hi> and be a <hi>scandal</hi> to all Nations. And has not this been verified in all ages; See what was the State of <hi>Christians</hi> in the primitive times, when as yet Vice had not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the purity of the Gospel. 'Tis almost impossible to believe in what contempt they were, and how utterly abominated. <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who was a sharer of a great part, gives us so lamentable a account of the <hi>Christians</hi> in his time, that 'tis able to move compassion in stones. He tells us, so many <hi>malicious Slanders</hi> were dispers'd abroad, concerning the manner of their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60203:3"/>
               <hi>Worship</hi>; and their whole <hi>Doctrine</hi> describ'd, not only to be <hi>folly, and meer toys,</hi> but also to be grounded on most <hi>hellish Principles,</hi> and so to be full of <hi>Impieties,</hi> that the Heathens believ'd a man could not make profession of <hi>Christianity,</hi> without being tainted with all sorts of <hi>Crimes</hi>; without being an enemy to the <hi>Gods, to Princes, to the Laws,</hi>

               <hi>to good Manners, and to Nature.</hi> Hence they conceiv'd such <hi>prejudice</hi> against them, and they were render'd so <hi>impious</hi> in the opinion of the <hi>Vulgar</hi>; that whatsoever <hi>Accusations</hi> were brought in, tho' never so <hi>false and malicious</hi>; whatsoever <hi>Villanies</hi> were laid to their charge; all was welcom to the <hi>enraged multitude,</hi> to which nothing seem'd <hi>incredibie</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>those,</hi> that were thus already <hi>odious.</hi> Upon this it was, that they were brought in guilty of <hi>Atheism, of Superstition, of Idolatry, of Cruelty, of Sedition; of Conspiracies, of Treasons:</hi> and <hi>bloody</hi> Persecutions were rais'd against them, to which the people were exasperated by <hi>Fears and Iealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies: Quod Pontifices,</hi> (as <hi>Spondanus</hi> says) <hi>Gentilitiae super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitionis Christianos more solito, calumniis circumvenissent,</hi>

Is it not strange</hi> (says he) <hi>that the hatred wherewith this Name is pursued in such manner, blinds the minds of most Men, that when they witness the Probity of a</hi> Christian, <hi>they mix in their Discourse as a reproach,</hi> that he hath embraced this Religion. <hi>One
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60203:4"/>
saith; Truly, he of whom you speak is an Honest Man, if he were not a</hi> Christian, <hi>and his Life would be free from blame. Another; Do you know such a one, who had the reputation of a Wise and Discreet Man? He is lately turn'd</hi> Christian. <hi>(Again) These people, by an extreme</hi> blindness of hatred, <hi>speak to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Name</hi> Christian, <hi>when they strive to render it</hi> odious. <hi>For, say they, How pleasant, and of what a good humour, was that Woman? How sociable and jovial was that Man? 'Tis pity they should be</hi> Christians. <hi>So they impute the amendment of their Lives to the Profession of</hi> Christianity. <hi>Some of them also purchase the</hi> aversion <hi>they carry against the Name</hi> Christian, <hi>which we bear, with the price of what is most precious to them; rather desiring to lose the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of life, tranquility of mind, and all sorts of Commodities, than to see in their Houses That which they hate. A man, who heretofore had his mind full of</hi> Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie, <hi>can no longer endure the company of his</hi> Wife, <hi>what assurance soever he has of her Chastity, after once he perceives her to be turn'd</hi> Christian; <hi>and parts from her now, when her actions full of Modesty have extinguish'd all suspicions, wherewith he was heretofore mov'd. A</hi> Father, <hi>who of a long time endur'd the Disobedience of his</hi> Heathenish Son, <hi>resolves to take from him the hope of succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in his Inheritance, for</hi> turning Christian, <hi>when at the same time, exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting his Commands without murmuring. A</hi> Master <hi>that used his</hi> Slave <hi>gently, when his Carriage gave him some cause of distrust, now puts him far from him, for being a</hi> Christian, <hi>when he hath most assurance of his Fidelity. 'Tis commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a</hi> Crime <hi>to correct the disorders of a Mans Life, by the motions of a Holy Conversion to the</hi> Christian Faith; <hi>and the good which is produc'd by so happy a</hi> Change, <hi>works not so powerfully in the minds of men, as the hatred they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd against us. Indeed this hatred is strange; and when I consider, that the Name of</hi> Christian <hi>only, makes it be so, I would willingly know, how a name can be criminal, and how a simple word can be accused</hi>? Thus was Christianity wholly <hi>infamous</hi> amongst the <hi>Heathens,</hi> contemn'd and detested by all; and where <hi>Lies</hi> were in credit, <hi>Calumnies</hi> and <hi>Slanders</hi> confirm'd and back'd by <hi>Authority,</hi> there was no other Crime but <hi>Truth.</hi> And 'twas these <hi>Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> these <hi>false Accusations</hi> (invented to cry down the Christian Religion,) oblig'd <hi>Tertullian</hi> to write his <hi>Apology,</hi> wherein he declar'd to the World, that <hi>Christianity</hi> was nothing like that, which the Heathens imagin'd it to be: That <hi>Idolatry, Superstition, Impiety, Cruelty, Treachery, Conspiracies, &amp;c.</hi> was none of their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> but condemn'd and detested by them; that these <hi>Crimes</hi> were only the <hi>malicious inventions</hi> of the <hi>Heathenish Priests,</hi> who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves unable to withstand the <hi>force of Christianity,</hi> had no other way to preserve <hi>themselves</hi> in <hi>Repute,</hi> and the <hi>People</hi> in their <hi>Errour,</hi> than by forming an ugly, odious, and most horrid <hi>Vizor,</hi> a damnable Scheme of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, than holding this forth to the World, and crying out, <hi>This is the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60203:4"/>
Religion of the Christians, these are their Principles; Behold their Ignorance, their Stupidity, their Profaneness; Behold their Insolence, their Villanies, a People unsufferable in a Commonwealth, Enemies to their Country and their Prince:</hi> And thus representing it as <hi>monstrous</hi> as they pleas'd, they brought an <hi>odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> upon as many as own'd that <hi>Name,</hi> and condemn'd them for <hi>Follies</hi> and <hi>Crimes,</hi> that were no where, but in their own <hi>Imagination.</hi> And 'twas not only in <hi>Tertullians</hi> time, that <hi>Christianity</hi> lay under <hi>this scandal,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in after ages: And therefore, as for the Vindication of the Christian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, he was forc'd to apologize for his time; so did after him St. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Arnobius,</hi> and many other Ecclesiastical Writers; nay, and under Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Emperors, the <hi>Calumnies</hi> of the <hi>Heathens</hi> yet being urg'd with much vigour and confidence, <hi>Orosius</hi> was oblig'd to write his History, and St. <hi>Augustine his City of God,</hi> in defence of the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Christ. And now, when by the propagation of Christianity, and the laborious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of her Professors, Heathenism was pretty well extinct; yet was not the Mouth of <hi>Malice</hi> stopp'd; the same <hi>Calumnies,</hi> which had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the <hi>Infidels,</hi> being taken up by <hi>evil Christians.</hi> No one <hi>going</hi> out from the Communion of the <hi>Church</hi> of Christ, but what did, by reviving <hi>old Scandals,</hi> (and the addition of <hi>fresh</hi> ones,) endeavour to make her <hi>infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,</hi> and <hi>blacken</hi> her with such Crimes, as could be thought most convenient for rendring her <hi>odious</hi> to all. It being look'd upon by as many as ever <hi>went out</hi> of her, the best means to justifie their <hi>Separation,</hi> and to gain to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the credit of <hi>Orthodox</hi> Christians; to paint <hi>her</hi> out in all the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian</hi> Colours, and represent her as <hi>Hellish,</hi> as Wickedness could make her. 'Tis strange how much she suffer'd in this Point from the <hi>Manichees,</hi> and from the <hi>Donatists,</hi> and how much pains it cost Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> to prove their <hi>Accusations</hi> to be meer <hi>Calumnies,</hi> principally intended to raise <hi>prejudices</hi> in the minds of the <hi>People</hi> against her; that so being convinc'd by these Hellish Artifices, of her teaching <hi>unsound</hi> and <hi>profane Doctrine, wicked Principles,</hi> and <hi>humane Inventions</hi> instead of <hi>Faith,</hi> might never think of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>her,</hi> to learn the <hi>Truth</hi>; nor even so much as suspect <hi>her</hi> to be the <hi>Church</hi> of Christ. This, Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> complains, was the chief cause of his continuing in the Error of the <hi>Manichees</hi> so long; and that he impugn'd with so much violence this <hi>Church.</hi> And therefore, after he was come to the knowledge of the <hi>Truth,</hi> he discover'd this to the World for the unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving others, who were caught in the same snare, making it part of his Confessions, <hi>Confess. l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 1.) <hi>When I came to discover,</hi> says he, <hi>that— I mingled Ioy and Blushes, and was asham'd, that I had now for so many years been barking and railing, not against the Catholick Faith, but only against the fictions of my carnal conceits. For so temerarious and impious was I, that, those
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60203:5"/>
things which I ought first to have learned from them by enquiry, I first charg'd upon them by Accusation; readier to impose Falshoods than to be inform'd of the Truth, — And thus I so blindly accused the Catholick Church; now suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently clear'd to me that she taught not the Opinion, I so vehemently persecuted.</hi> And this he did, deluded and deceiv'd by the <hi>Manichees.</hi> And now since 'tis certain, that this has not been the case of Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> alone, but of as many almost, as have given ear to the <hi>Deserters</hi> of <hi>this Church</hi>; nay, is at this day the case of infinite numbers, who following that Great <hi>Father,</hi> when as yet in his <hi>Errors; do not enquire, how this thing is believ'd or understood by her, but insultingly oppose all; as if so understood, as they imagine; not making any difference betwixt what the Catholick Church teaches, and what they think she teaches:</hi> and so believing her to be guilty of as many <hi>absurdities, follies, impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> &amp;c. as the <hi>Heathens</hi> did of old: 'Tis evident, there's as much need now of <hi>Apologies,</hi> as ever there was in <hi>Tertellian</hi>'s or S. <hi>Austin</hi>'s time: Not <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies</hi> to vindicate what is really her <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi>; but rather to clear her from such <hi>Superstitions, Profaneness,</hi> and <hi>wicked Principles,</hi> as are <hi>malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously</hi> or <hi>ignorantly</hi> charg'd upon her. And tho' the number of Calumnies, the in-sincerity of Adversaries, the obstinacy of a byass'd Education render a performance in this kind, a just Task for a <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s, or St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s hand; yet because I find no such eminent Pen engag'd in this design at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; and the shewing the <hi>true Religion</hi> in its <hi>own Colours,</hi> seems a Duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on every one that's a lover of Truth; I'le endeavour to pull off the <hi>Vizor</hi> from <hi>suffering Christianity,</hi> and apologize for the <hi>Cotholick Faith</hi>; that Faith, I mean, maintained by those <hi>Primitive Fathers,</hi> with so much Vigour and Zeal; which being first planted in the <hi>Head City</hi> of the World by St. <hi>

               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:60203:5"/>
of a <hi>Papist:</hi> The <hi>one</hi> expressing a <hi>Papist</hi> in those very <hi>colours</hi> as he is painted in the <hi>imagination</hi> of the <hi>Vulgar, Foul, black</hi> and <hi>Antichristian</hi>; with the chief <hi>Articles</hi> of his <hi>imagined Belief,</hi> and <hi>reputed Principles</hi> of his Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. The <hi>other</hi> representing a <hi>Papist,</hi> whose <hi>Faith</hi> and exercise of his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> is according to the <hi>Direction</hi> and <hi>Command</hi> of <hi>his Church.</hi> That so, these two being thus set together, their <hi>difference</hi> and <hi>disproportion</hi> may be clearly discerned, and a discovery made, how <hi>unlike Calumny</hi> is from <hi>Truth</hi>; and how different a <hi>Papist really is,</hi> from what he's <hi>said to be.</hi> The <hi>former</hi> Character is of a <hi>Papist Mis-represented</hi>; the <hi>other</hi> of a <hi>Papist Represented.</hi> The former is a <hi>Papist</hi> so deform'd and monstrous, that it justly deserves the hatred of as many as own <hi>Christianity</hi>; 'Tis a <hi>Papist</hi> that has disturb'd this Nation now above an hundred years with Fears and Jealousies; threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it continually with Fire and Massacres, and whose whole Design has been, to rob the <hi>Sovereign</hi> of his Crown, and the <hi>Subject</hi> of his <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Papist,</hi> that is so abominable, so malicious, so unsufferable in any Civil Government, that, for my part, I detest him from my heart; I conceiv'd an hatred against him, and all his, from my Education, when as yet a <hi>Protestant</hi>; and now, being a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> I am not in the least reconcil'd to <hi>him,</hi> nor his <hi>Principles,</hi> but hate him yet worse. I am so far from thinking the <hi>Laws</hi> too severe against <hi>such Popish Recusants,</hi> that I could wish a far greater severity were executed against them, their Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and all such as make men so sottishly Religious. And if to be a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant,</hi> nothing more be requisite, than to protest against <hi>such Popery,</hi> to hate and detest it; I think my self, and all <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> as good <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi> as any whatsoever throughout his <hi>Majesties</hi> Dominions. And I dare engage, that not only as many <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> as under the name of <hi>Papists</hi> have severely smarted in this Nation, for being the Professors of <hi>such kind of Popery,</hi> but also that all <hi>Roman Catholick Nations</hi> in the World shall subscribe to the Condemnation of all <hi>such</hi> Popish Principles and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, shall joyn with all good <hi>Protestants</hi> for the extinguishing it, with all that profess or practice it, and utter rooting it out from his <hi>Majesties</hi> three Kingdoms, and the whole Universe. The other <hi>Papist</hi> is one, that lives and believes according to what is prescrib'd in the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> in <hi>Catechisms</hi> set forth by Catholicks, and other Spiritual Books, for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Instruction of all in their Communion, whose <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> I have here set down, with some Grounds and Reasons of it, and will so leave it to apologize for it self. In drawing out the Character of the <hi>former,</hi> I have quoted no <hi>Authors,</hi> but have describ'd him exactly according to the Apprehension I had of a <hi>Papist,</hi> fram'd by Me when I was a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi>; with the addition only of some few points, which have been violently
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60203:6"/>
charg'd against Me by some intimate Friends of late, to shew the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness of my choice, after the quitting of that Communion. The latter is wholly copied out from the <hi>Papist</hi> that <hi>I am now</hi>; being the Sum of what I was taught, when reconcil'd to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and which after sixteen years conversation with Men of that Communion, in hearing their Sermons, in being present at their Catechising, in reading their Books, and discoursing with them, I have found to be their <hi>Doctrine.</hi> I have done both, I hope, with Sincerity and Truth, and without Passion. For as my endeavours have been, that my <hi>Religion</hi> should lose nothing by <hi>Lies,</hi> so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I desire it should gain by them; And did I but know of any thing in the following Papers, that has any relation to that <hi>unchristian Artifice,</hi> I would strike it out immediately. And do here oblige my self, upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, either from Friend or Adversary, to acknowledge the mistake, as it shall be made appear, and make a publick Recantation.

            <p>THE <hi>Introduction</hi> consists of two parts,
<list>
                  <item>I. A general Complaint of the <hi>Papists</hi> being <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>represented</hi> among us.</item>
                  <item>II. An Account of the Method he hath taken to clear them from these <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>representions.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. As to the <hi>First</hi>; Whether it be just, or not, must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd in the several particulars. But here we must consider, whether it serves the End it is designed for in this place, which is, to gain the Reader's good Opinion of their Innocency: Not meerly because they complain so much of being injured, but because the best Men in all Times have been <hi>mis-represented</hi>; as he proves at large in this <hi>Introduction,</hi> from several Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Old and New <hi>Testament, but especially of Christ and his Apostles, and the Primitive Christians.</hi> But it is observable, that when Bp. <hi>Iewel</hi> began his excellent <hi>Apology</hi> for the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> with a Complaint much of the same Nature, and produced the very same Examples, his Adversary would by no means allow it to have any Force, being, as he called it, <hi>Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium Commune,</hi> which might be used on both sides, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60203:6"/>
could be proper to neither. And although it be reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble only for those to complain of being <hi>mis-represented,</hi> who having Truth on their side, do notwithstanding suffer under the Imputation of Error; yet it is possible for those who are very much <hi>mistaken,</hi> to complain of being <hi>mis-represented</hi>; and while they go about to remove the Misrepresentations of others, to make new Ones of their own. And as the best Men. and the best Things, have been mis-represented; so other Men have been as apt to complain of it: and the worst Things are as much mis-represented, when they are made to appear not so bad as they are. For <hi>Evil</hi> is as truly mis represented under the appearance of <hi>Good,</hi> as <hi>Good</hi> under the appearance of <hi>Evil</hi>; and it is hard to determine whether hath done the greater Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
            <p>So that if <hi>the Father of Lies be the Author of Mis-representing,</hi> (as the <hi>Introduction</hi> begins) we must have a care of him both ways. For when <hi>he tried this black Art in Paradise,</hi> (as our Author speaks) it was both by mis-representing the Command, and the Danger of trangressing it. He did not only make the Command appear otherwise than it was; but he did very much lessen the Punishment of Disobedience, and by that means de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded our first Parents into that Sin and Misery, under which their Posterity still suffers. Which ought to be a Caution to them, how dangerous it is to break the Law of God under the fairest Colour and Pretences; and that they should not be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily imposed upon by false Glosses, and plausible Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, though made by such as therein pretend to be <hi>Angels of Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But although <hi>the Father of Lies be the Author of Mis-represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> yet we have no reason to think, but that if he were to plead his own Cause to Mankind, he would very much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of being <hi>mis-represented</hi> by them; and even in this respect, when they make him the <hi>Father</hi> of those <hi>Lies</hi> which are their own Inventions. And can that be a certain Argument of Truth, which may as well be used by <hi>the Father of Lies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the great Instruments he hath made use of in deceiving and corrupting Mankind, have been as forward as any to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of being <hi>mis-represented.</hi> The true Reason is, Because no great Evil can prevail in the World, unless it be represented otherwise than it is; and all Men are not competent Judges of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60203:7"/>
the Colours of Good and Evil; therefore when the Designs of those who go about to deceive, begin to be laid open, they then betake themselves to the fairest Representations they can make of themselves, and hope that many will not see through their pretences.</p>
            <p>If I had a mind to follow our Author's Method, I could make as long a Deduction of Instances of this kind. But I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my self with some few Examples of those who are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on both sides to have been guilty of great Errors and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Arrians</hi> pleaded they were <hi>mis-represented,</hi> when they were taken for Enemies to Christ's Divinity; for all that they contended for, was only such a moment of time, as would make good the Relation between Father and Son.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pelagians,</hi> with great success for some time (and even at <hi>Rome)</hi> complained, that they were very much <hi>mis-represented,</hi> as Enemies to God's Grace; whereas they owned and asserted the manifold Grace of God; and were only Enemies to Mens Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and neglect of their Duties.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Nestorians</hi> gave out, that they never intended to make two Persons in Christ, as their Adversaries charged them; but all their design was to avoid Blasphemy, in calling the Blessed Virgin <hi>the Mother of God</hi>; and whatever went beyond this, was their Adversaries <hi>Mis-representations,</hi> and not their own Opinions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ychians</hi> thought themselves very hardly dealt with, for saying, there was <hi>but one Nature in Christ</hi>; they did not mean thereby (as they said) to destroy the Properties of the Humane Nature, but only to assert that its Subsistence was swallowed up by the Divine; and of all Persons, those have no reason to blame them, who suppose the Properties of one Substance may be united to another.</p>
            <p>Even the <hi>Gentile Idolaters,</hi> when they were charged by the Christians, <hi>that they worshipped Stocks and Stones,</hi> complained, they were <hi>mis-represented</hi>; for they were not such Ideots, to take things for Gods, which had neither Life, nor Sense, nor Motion in them. And when they were charged <hi>with worshipping other Gods as they did the Supream</hi>; they desired their Sense might not be taken from common prejudices, or vulgar pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, but from the Doctrine of their Philosophers; and they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60203:7"/>
owned a Sovereign Worship due to him that was Chief; and a subordinate and relative to some Celestial Beings, whom they made application to as Mediators between him and them. Must all these Complaints now be taken for granted? What then becomes of the Reputation of General Councils, or the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians? But as, if it were enough to be Accused, none would be Innocent; so none would be Guilty, if it were enough to complain of being <hi>mis-represented.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore in all Complaints of this Nature, it is necessary to come to particulars; and to examine with care and Diligence the Matters complained of, and then to give Judgment in the <hi>Case.</hi> I am glad to find our Author professing so much <hi>Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Truth without Passion</hi>; and I do assure him I shall follow what he professes: For the Cause of our Church is such, as needs neither Tricks nor Passion to defend it; and therefore I shall endeavour to state the Matters in Difference, with all the clearness and calmness that may be; and I shall keep close to his Method and Representations, without Digressions, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking Reflections.</p>
            <p n="2">II. But I must declare my self very much unsatisfied with the Method he hath taken to clear his Party from these <hi>Mis-repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations.</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He takes upon him to draw a double Character of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist; and in the one he pretends to follow a certain Rule, but not in the other; which is not fair and ingenuous.</p>
            <p>As to the one, he saith, <hi>He follows the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>and their allowed Spiritual Books and Catechisms:</hi> and we find no fault with this. But why must the other Part then be drawn by Fancy, or common Prejudices, or ignorant Mistakes? Have we no Rule, whereby the Judgment of our Church is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? Are not our Articles as easie to be had and understood, as the Decrees and Canons of the Council of <hi>Trent?</hi> I will not ask, How the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> comes to be the Rule and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Doctrine to any here, where it was never received? But I hope I may, why our Representations are not to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Sense of our Church, as theirs from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent?</hi> If he saith, <hi>his Design was to remove common Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, and vulgar Mistakes</hi>; it is easie to answer, if they are contrary to the Doctrine of our Church, we utterly disown
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60203:8"/>
them. We know very well there are Persons, who have so false a Notion of <hi>Popery,</hi> that they charge the Rites and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms of our Church with it: but we pity their Weakness and Folly, and are far from defending such Mis-representations. But that which we adhere to, is the Doctrine and Sense of our Church, as it is by Law established; and what Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are made agreeable thereto, I undertake to defend, and no other. But if a person take the liberty to lay on what Colours he pleases on one side, it will be no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to take them off in the other, and then to say, <hi>How much fairer is our Church than she is painted!</hi> It is an easie, but not so allowable a way of disputing, for the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to make the Objections and Answers too; for he may so model and frame the Arguments by a little Art, that the Answers may appear very full and sufficient; whereas if they had been truly represented, they would be found very lame and defective.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He pretends to give an Account why he quotes no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors for his Mis-representations, which is very unsatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>viz. That he hath d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ding to the Apprehension he had of him when he was a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant.</hi> But how can we tell what sort of Protestant he was; nor how well he was instructed in his Religion? And must the Character now supposed to be common to Protestants, be taken from his ignorant, or childish, or wilful Mistakes? Did ever any Protestant that understands himself, say, <hi>That Papists are never permitted to hear Sermons which they are able to understand, or that they held it lawful to commit Idolatry</hi>; Or, <hi>that a Papist believes the Pope to be his great God, and to be far above all Angels, &amp;c?</hi> Yet these are some of his Misrepresentations. Did he in earnest think so himself? If he did, he gives no good account of himself: if he did not, he gives a worse; for then how shall we believe him in other things, when he saith, <hi>He hath drawn his Mis-representations exactly according to his own Apprehensions?</hi> It is true, he saith, <hi>he added some few points, which were violently charged on him by his Friends:</hi> but we dare be bold to say, these were none of them. But let us suppose it true, that he had such Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions himself. Are these fit to be printed as the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of a Party? What would they say to us, if a Spanish
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60203:8"/>
Convert should give a Character of <hi>Protestants</hi>; according to the common Opinion the people there have of them; and set down in one Column their monstrous Mis-represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and in another, what he found them to be since his coming hither; and that in good Truth he saw they were just like other Men? But suppose he had false Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions before he went among them; why did he not take care to inform himself better before he changed? Had he no Friends, no Books, no Means to rectifie his Mistakes? Must he needs leave one Church, and go to another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he understood either? If this be a true Account of himself, it is but a bad Account of the Reasons of his Change.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The Account he gives of the other part of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, affords as little Satisfaction: For although in the general, it be well that he pretends to keep to a Rule,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) He shews no Authority he hath to interpret that Rule in his own sense. Now several of his Representations depend upon his own private Sense and Opinions, against the Doctrine of many others as zealous for the Church as himself; and what reason have we to adhere to his Representations, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to theirs? As for instance, he saith, <hi>The Pope's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Infallibility is no Matter of Faith</hi>: But there are others say it is, and is grounded on the same Promises which makes him Head of the Church. Why now must we take his Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation rather than theirs? And so as to the <hi>Deposing Power,</hi> he grants, <hi>it hath been the Opinion of several Popes</hi> (and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils too) <hi>but that it is no matter of Faith.</hi> But whose Judgment are we to take in this Matter, according to the Principles of their Church? A private Man's, of no Name, no Authority, or of those Popes and Councils who have declared it, and acted by it? And can any man of their Church justifie our relying upon his Word, against the Declaration of Popes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils? But suppose the Question be about the Sense of his own Rule, <hi>the Council of Trent:</hi>

            <p n="2">(2.) He leaves out, in the several Particulars, an essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of the Character of a <hi>Papist</hi> since the Council of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60203:9"/>
               <hi>Trent</hi>; which is, that he doth not only believe the Doctrines there defined to be true, but to be necessary to Salvation. And there is not a word of this in his Representation of the Points of Doctrine, but the whole is managed as though there were nothing but a difference about some particular Opinions; whereas in truth, the Necessity of holding those Doctrines, in order to Salvation, is the main Point in difference. If Men have no mind to believe their own Senses, we know not how to help it; but we think it is very hard to be told, we cannot be saved unless we renounce them too. And this now appears to be the true State of the Case, since <hi>Pius</hi> the 4<hi>th</hi> drew up and published a Confession of Faith, according to the Decrees and Canons of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> wherein Men are not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired <hi>to believe their Traditions as firmly as the Bible, the Seven Sacraments, Transubstantiation, the Sacrifice of the Mass, Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, Invocation of Saints, worshipping of Images, Indulgences, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,</hi> &amp;c. but they must believe, <hi>that without believing these things, there is no Salvation to be had</hi> in the ordinary way; for after the enumeration of those Points, it follows, <hi>Hanc veram Catholicam sidem extra quam nemo salvus esse potest, &amp;c. This is the true Catholick Faith, without which no man can be saved; i. e.</hi> The belief of these things is hereby declared as necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as of any other Articles of the Creed. But it may be objected, <hi>The subscribing this Profession of Faith, is not required of all Members of that Church.</hi> To which I answer, That to make a Man a Member of it, he must declare that he holds the same Faith which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holds: And this is as much the Faith of the Roman Church, as the Pope and Council of <hi>Trent</hi> could make it. And it is now printed in the Roman <hi>Ritual</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> set forth by <hi>Paul</hi> the 5<hi>th,</hi> as the Confession of Faith owned by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And therefore this ought to have been a part of the true Representation, as to the Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Points; but when he comes to the 35<hi>th</hi> Head, he then owns, <hi>That unless Men do believe every Article of the Roman Faith, they cannot be saved, and he that disbelieves one, does in a manner disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all.</hi> Which may as well reach those who disown the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing Power, and the Pope's personal Infallibility, as Us, since those are accounted Articles of Faith by the ruling part of their Church, to whom it chiefly belongs to declare them; and the former hath been defined both by Popes and Councils.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:60203:9"/>(3.) He never sets down what it is which makes any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to become a Doctrine of their Church. We are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten blamed for charging particular Opinions upon their Church; but we desire to know what it is which makes a Doctrine of their Church; <hi>i. e.</hi> whether frequent and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Declaration, by the Heads and Guides of their Church, be sufficient or not to that End? Our Author seems to imply the Necessity of some Conditions to be observed; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <hi>the Popes Authority,</hi> he requires <hi>due Circumstances, and proceeding according to Law</hi>: But who is to be Judge of these Circumstances and legal Proceedings? And he never tells what these <hi>Circumstances</hi> are. And yet after all, he saith, <hi>The Orders of the Supream Pastor are to be obey'd, whether he be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible or not.</hi> And this now brings the Matter home; <hi>The Popes,</hi> he confesses, <hi>have owned the Deposing Doctrine, and acted according to it:</hi> And others are bound to obey their Orders, whether infallible or not; and consequently they are bound by the Doctrine of their Church to act, when the Popes shall require it, according to the Deposing Power. But he seems to say, in this Case, that a Doctrine of their Church is to be judged by their Number; for, saith he, <hi>There are greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that disown this Doctrine.</hi> I will not at present dispute it; but I desire to be informed, Whether the Doctrines of their Church go by majority of Votes, or not? I had thought the Authority of the Guides of the Church ought to have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ballanced any Number of Dissenters. For, what are those who refuse to submit to the Dictates of Popes and Councils, but Dissenters from the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of the <hi>Court and Church of Rome,</hi> is wholly imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in this Case. For, we here consider not the meer Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Power which makes the Court, but the Spiritual Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of Teaching the Church: and if Popes and Councils may err in Teaching this Doctrine, why not in any other? I know there are some that say, <hi>Vniversal Tradition is necessary to make a Doctrine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f their Church.</hi> But then no Submission can be required to any Doctrine in that Church, till the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Tradition of it, in all Times, and in all Parts of the Christian Church, be proved. And we need to desire no better Terms than these, as to all Points of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the 4<hi>th</hi> his Creed, which are in dispute between us and them.</p>

He makes use of the Authority of some particular Divines, as delivering the Sense of their Church, when there are so many of greater Authority against them. Whereas, if we proceed by his own Rule, the greater Number is to carry it. Therefore we cannot be thought to <hi>mis-represent</hi> them, if we charge them with such things as are owned, either by the general and allowed Practices of their Church, or their publick Offices, or the generality of their Divines and Casuists; or in case of a Contest, with that side which is owned by the Guides of their Church, when the other is censured; or which was approved by their Canonized Saints, or declared by their Popes and councils, whose De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees they are bound to follow.

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:60203:11"/>2. To make some Reflections on what he saith, in order to the clearing them from Misrepresentations.</p>
            <p>As to the State of this Controversy, as it stands, since the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> we are to consider.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We must distinguish between what persons do in their own Opinion; and what they do according to the Sense of the Divine Law. It is possible that men may intend one thing, and the Law give another Sense of it: as is often seen in the Case of Treason; although the persons plead never so much they had no intention to commit Treason, yet if the Law makes their Act to be so, their disavowing it doth not excuse them. So it is in the present Case; Men may have real and serious Intentions, to refer their final, ultimate, and Sovereign Worship only to God; but if the Law of God strictly and severely prohibits this particular manner of Worship by Images, in as full, plain, and clear words as may be, and gives a Demonination to such Acts, taken from the immediate Object of it; no particular Intention of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons can alter that Denomination, or make the Guilt to be less than the Law makes it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There can be no <hi>Misrepresenting</hi> as to the lawfulness of many External Acts of Worship, with Respect to Images, which are owned by them. But it doth not look fairly to put the Title, <hi>Of Praying to Images</hi>; for the Question is, <hi>about the Worship of Images:</hi> Whereas this Title would insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate, as though we did directly charge them with <hi>Praying to their Images, without any farther Respect.</hi> Which we are so far from charging them with, that I do not know of any People in the World, who are not like <hi>Stones</hi> and <hi>Stocks</hi> themselves, who are liable to that Charge. The <hi>PEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DETS</hi> in the <hi>East-Indies</hi> are fully cleared from it, by <hi>Thavenet,</hi> as well as <hi>Bernier.</hi>

That all the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration they express bèfore Images, whether by kneeling, praying, lifting up the Eyes, burning Candles, Incense,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is not at all done for the Image, but is wholly referr'd to the things represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which he intends to honour by these Actions.</hi> But I hope now, it is no Misrepresenting for us to say, that <hi>they do kneel, pray, lift up their Eyes, burn Candles, Incense, &amp;c.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60203:12"/>
before their Images</hi>; which is all I charge them with at present.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To perform these Acts before Images, without a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to worship the Images by them, is declared, by great Divines of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be next to Heresie. The Case was this; There were before the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> several Persons who lived in Communion of that Church, but by no means approved the Worship of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, such as <hi>Durandus, Helcot, Picus Mirandula,</hi> and others. Now these Persons thought fit to comply in these Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Acts, but declared they intended not to worship the Images, but the Objects before them.

               <hi>This way of</hi> Durandus <hi>is dangerous, rash, and savours of Heresie</hi>; and he saith further from <hi>Medina, That it was</hi> Victoria<hi>'s Opinion, that it was Heretical,</hi>; but he adds, that his own Opinion, <hi>that Images were truly and properly to be Worshipped, was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally received by their Divines:</hi> and therefore I need name no more.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is granted by their Divines and Casuists, that the People in the Worship of Images may easily fall into Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) If the Worship do not pass from the Image to the Thing represented. And so <hi>Aquinas</hi> himself determines, That no Irrational Creature is capable of Worship, but as it hath, Respect to a Rational Being. But here lies the Difficulty, how an Extrinsecal Relation to an Object of Worship, where the Thing is confessed to deserve none, can give any Reason, for its being properly worshiped. But they all grant, if the Worship stop at the Inanimate part, it can be no other than the Worship of Stocks and Stones.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) If the Worship be given to the Image, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to God alone.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60203:12"/>
it must be Relative, <hi>i. e.</hi> given to the Image for the sake of Christ represented by it.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) <hi>If the People believe any Divinity to be in the Images,</hi>

               <hi>or put any Trust or Confidence in them,</hi> then the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> it self owns such to be like the Heathen Idolaters. Now, how shall it be known when the People believe Divinity to be in Images, but by some more than ordinary Presence or Operation in or by them? by their having a greater Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of one Image than of another of the same Person? by their going long Pilgrimages to certain Images in hopes of Relief, when they might easily cause Images to represent at home?</p>
            <p>And that such are no extravagant Imaginations, is known to all who have heard of <hi>Loretto,</hi> or <hi>Compostella,</hi> or other places nearer home. I need not mention the Complaints of <hi>Polydore Virgil, Cassander,</hi> or <hi>Wicelius</hi> to this purpose, who all died in the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; for the same is very lately complained of by a considerable Person in that Communion, who saith, <hi>The greatest part of the Devotion of the People of</hi> Italy, Spain, <hi>and</hi> Portugal,<note place="margin">

            <p>The Question now is, Whether the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath taken any effectual Course to prevent these <hi>Abuses?</hi> If not, what <hi>Mis-representing</hi> is it to charge the Abuses upon the Doctrines and Practices allowed by it?</p>
            <p>The Remedies prescribed by the Council, are these;</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Declaring that there is no Divinity or Vertue in them for which they should be worshipped; and that nothing is to be desired of them, nor any Trust or Confidence to be put in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Expressing their earnest desire, that if any Abuses have crept in, they may be removed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:60203:13"/>But in the mean time the Council decrees, <hi>the Images not only to be useful to be set up in Churches, but to have due Honour and Worship given them there, for the sake of those they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; as not only putting off the Hat, but falling down before them,</hi> And the <hi>Roman Catechism</hi> declares, <hi>That this Worship is very beneficial to the People,</hi>

               <hi>and so much is to be told them; and that Images are to be in Churches, not meerly for Instruction, sed ut colantur,</hi> that they may be worshipped.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But what could the Council do more, than to desire all Abuses may be taken away; and is it not then the fault of others, and not of the Council, if they be not?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I grant, the Council doth desire <hi>Abuses may be taken away, if any such be</hi>; but then it enumerates those Abuses, in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terodox Images, in making Gain of Images, in painting them too wantonly:</hi> but besides, it doth say, <hi>that all Superstition be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved in the Sacred Vse of Images</hi>; but it doth not say in <hi>the Worship of them</hi>; and so it may relate to <hi>Magick</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination,</hi> But that the Council could not prevent, or design to prevent the <hi>Abuses</hi> mention'd in the Worship of Images, will appear by these things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Cuoncil of <hi>Trent</hi> allows the highest relative Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to be given to them: it setting no bounds to it, so it be for the sake of the Prototypes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It allows a Worship to be given to the Images them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves too; for it confirms the second Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which decreed an inferiour Adoration to be given to them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It disapproves no Customs then practised among them in the Worship of Images; which were all known, and by many complained of, both as Pilgrimages to them, and the carrying of them about in Procession, and the solemn Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration of them; the Form whereof is not only inserted but inlarged in the new Pontifical since the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> And it is to be observed, that in the old Pontifical, <hi>A. D.</hi> 1511. there is no Form for consecrating an Image; in that of <hi>Paul</hi> the 3<hi>d,</hi> it is inserted; but out of <hi>Durandus</hi>; but in that of <hi>Clement</hi> the 8<hi>th,</hi> it is put in more largely and as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentically as if it had been always there. And is not this the way to reform the Worship of Images?</p>
            <p>To come now to our Author's Reflections, on the <hi>Mis-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation</hi> he saith hath been made as to this Point.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:60203:13"/>1. <hi>A Papist represented, believes it damnable to worship Stocks and Stones for Gods; to pray to Pictures or Images of Christ, the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>or any other Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Expressions are capable of a double Sense, and therefore this is not fair Representing.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>To worship Stocks or Stones for Gods,</hi> may signifie two things. (1.) To believe the very Stocks and Stones to be Gods. And this we do not charge them with. (2.) To give to Images made of Wood and Stone, the Worship due only to God; and so by construction of the Fact, to make them <hi>Gods,</hi> by giving them <hi>Divine Worship.</hi> And if they will clear themselves of this, they must either prove that <hi>External Adoration</hi> is no part of Divine Worship, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Scripture makes it so, and all the rest of Mankind look upon it as such, even Jews, Turks, and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels) or that their external Adoration hath no respect to the Images (which is contrary to the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>) or that Divine Worship being due to the Being Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, it may be likewise given to the Image. And how then could the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> be condemned for giving Divine Worship to the Image of Christ, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confesses; and is affirmed by <hi>Irenaeus, Epiphanius,</hi> S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascen?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>To pray to Images of Christ, or the Blessed Virgin,</hi> may likewise be taken in two senses. (1.) To pray to them, so as to expect to be heard by the meer Images, and so we do not charge them with it. (2.) To pray to them, so as to expect to be rather heard by themselves for praying to them by their Images. And if this be not so; to what end are the Prayers made in the Consecration of Images, for those that shall pray before them? To what purpose do so many go in long Pilgrimages to certain Images, if they do not hope to be better heard for praying there?</p>
            <p>But he goes on, 2. <hi>He keeps them by him indeed, to keep in his mind the memory of the things represented by them.</hi> And is this all in good Truth? We will never quarrel with them, if this be true Representing. No, that he dares not say.</p>
            <p>But, 3. <hi>He is taught to use them.</hi> But how? <hi>by custing his Eye upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ictures or Images, and thence to raise his Heart to the Prototypes.</hi> And is this all yet? No.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:60203:14"/>But, 4. He finds a double conveniency in the use of them. (1.) <hi>They represent at one glance</hi>; and Men may easily make <hi>good</hi> Reflections, as <hi>upon the sight of a Death's Head, or</hi> Old Time <hi>painted with his Fore-lock, Hour-glass, and Scyth.</hi> And will he undertake, that Images shall be used in Churches for no other End? Was the Picture of <hi>Old Time</hi> ever <hi>conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated,</hi> or placed upon the <hi>Altar,</hi> or elsewhere, <hi>that it might be worshipped?</hi> as the <hi>Roman Catechism</hi> speaks of their Images. (2.) <hi>They cure Distractions; for they call back his wandring Thoughts to the Right Object.</hi> What is this <hi>Right Object?</hi> the Image, or the Person represented? And that must be either a Creature, or God himself. If it be a Creature, doth not this imply that it is made a <hi>Right Object of Worship?</hi> If God himself, how doth an Image cure our Distraction, in the Worship of an infinite invisible Being; when the very Image is most apt to distract our Thoughts, by drawing them down from his Divine and Adorable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, to the gross and mean Representations of an Image. But are we yet to come to the utmost use of them? No.</p>
            <p>But, 5. <hi>He cannot but love, honour, and respect the Images themselves, for the sake of those they represent.</hi> Will this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent them? And will he promise to go no further? It is hard to part upon Terms of meer <hi>Respect and decent Regard,</hi> where there is no encroachment upon <hi>Divine Worship.</hi> And here we are at a stand.</p>
            <p>But he goes further. 6. And so he is come at last, <hi>to Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration before Images.</hi> And is this all? Dares he deny <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to Images,</hi> when the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined it. <hi>Eisque venerationem impartiendam?</hi> What is this Veneration <hi>before Images</hi> only? <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath a Chapter on purpose to prove, that <hi>true and proper Worship is to be given to Images.</hi> And was he a <hi>Misrepresenter? Suarez</hi> saith, <hi>It is an Article of Faith, that Worship is to be given to them.</hi> But if the Veneration be only before them, why are they consecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and set up in places proper for Adoration?</p>
            <p>But, 7. <hi>To satisfie any one that he is far from making Gods of his Images, he is ready to break them into a thousand pieces.</hi> What, a Consecrated Image? Dares he take a Crucifix from the Altar and tear it in pieces? This doth not look like <hi>the Love, Honour, and Respect</hi> he mentioned before, not
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60203:14"/>
to name <hi>Veneration.</hi> And I am afraid this is a strain beyond true Representing: Yet at length he hath found some pretty Parallels for the <hi>Veneration of Images themselves</hi>; and so we are come at last to the main Point. But this is not directly owned; yet in the way of his Representing, it is fairly insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated by his Parallels.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>A Christian loves and honours his Neighbour, because he bears the Image of God in his Soul.</hi> But doth he therefore take him and set him before him when he kneels at his Devotion: to raise his Mind, and cure his Distractions? Would he set him upon the Altar, and burn Incense before him, because of the Image of God in him? Is there no difference between the <hi>Object of Christian Love,</hi> and of <hi>Divine Worship?</hi> Nor between a Spiritual Invisible Divine Image in the Souls of Men, and a Material and Corporeal Representation?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>We may kiss and esteem the Bible, because it contains and represents to Vs Gods Word.</hi> But when we kiss and esteem the Bible, we remember the second Commandment is in it; and we dare not break his Law, when we pretend to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour his Word. But we think there is some difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Respect</hi> to the <hi>Bible,</hi> and <hi>falling down</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Image. The Circumstances of the one declare it to be meer <hi>Respect,</hi> and a <hi>Religious Decency</hi>; and if the other be not <hi>External Adoration,</hi> we know not what it is</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>A good Preacher is loved, because he minds Men of their Duty.</hi> But what should we say to him that should therefore <hi>kneel down and say his Prayers, and burn Candles and Incense before him,</hi> out of a Respect to his good Doctrine? Did S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> or S. <hi>Paul</hi> like this, when Men would have worshipped them? A good Preacher would tell them of their Duty, as they did; and take Men off from the Worship of any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, animate or inanimate, and direct them to worship God alone, who made Heaven and Earth.</p>

            <p>FOr the clear stating this Controversy, these things are to be premised.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We do not charge them, <hi>that they make Gods of dead men, i. e.</hi> that they believe the Saints to be Independent Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For this our Author confesses <hi>were a most damnable Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We do not say, that the State of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with respect to the Worship of dead men, is as bad as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenism. For we acknowledge the true Saints and Martyrs to have been, not only good and Vertuous, but extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Persons, in great Favour with God, and highly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60203:16"/>
our Esteem and Reverence, as well as Imitation; whereas the Heathen Deified Men, were vile and wicked Men, and deserved not the common Esteem of Mankind, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Accounts themselves give of them. And we own the common Doctrine and Advantages of Christianity to be preserved in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We do not deny, that they do allow some external Acts of Worship to be so proper to God alone, that they ought to be given to none else besides him. And this they call <hi>Latria</hi>; and we shall never dispute with them about the proper signification of a Word, when the Sense is agreed, unless they draw Inferences from it, which ought not to be allowed. To this <hi>Latria,</hi> they refer not only Sacrifice, but all that relates to it, as Temples, Altars, and Priests: so that by their own Confession, to make these immediately and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to the Honour of any Saint, is to make a God of that Saint, and to commit Idolatry.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They confess, that to pray to Saints to bestow Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual or Temporal Gifts upon us, were to give to them the Worship proper to God, who is the only giver of all good things. For else I do not understand, why they should take so much pains to let us know, that whatever the Forms of their Prayers and Hymns are, yet the Intention and Spirit of the Church, is only to desire them to pray for us, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thngs for us by their Intercession with God.</p>
            <p>But two things cannot be denied by them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they do use solemn Invocation of Saints in places of Divine Worship, at the same time they make their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses to God himself, with all the Circumstances of Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Adoration, with bended Knees and Eyes lifted up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and that this Practice is according to the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which not only decrees an humble Invocation of them, but declares it to be impiety to condemn mental and vocal Supplication to the Saints in Heaven.<note place="margin">Sect. 25.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That they do own making the Saints in Heaven to be their Mediators of Intercession<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but not of Redemption; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Christ be our Mediator in both senses.</p>
            <p>And upon these two Points this Controversy depends.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:60203:16"/>Let us now see what our <hi>Representer</hi> saith to them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>His Church teaches him indeed, and he believes that it is good and profitable, to desire the Intercession of the Saints reigning with Christ in Heaven; but that they are either Gods, or his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemers, he is no where taught, but detests all such Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two Ways of <hi>desiring Intercession of others for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. By way of <hi>Friendly Request,</hi> as an Act of mutual Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and so, no doubt, we may desire others here on Earth to pray for us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By way of <hi>Humble Supplication,</hi> with all the external Acts of Adoration: and we cannot think St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who refused any thing like <hi>Adoration</hi> from men, would have been pleased to have seen men fall down upon their Knees before them; and in the same posture of Devotion in which they were praying to Almighty God, to put their Names into the middle of their <hi>Litanies,</hi> and so pray them then to pray for them.</p>
            <p>But how are we sure that their Church teaches no more than this? I have read over and over the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the <hi>Roman Catechism</hi> about it, and I can find no such li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of their sense there, where, if any where, it ought to be found. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> mentions both the <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> and <hi>the Help and Assistance</hi> of the Saints which they are to fly to. If this <hi>Help</hi> and <hi>Assistance</hi> be no more than their <hi>Prayers,</hi> why is it mentioned as distinct? Why is <hi>their reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together with Christ in Heaven</hi> spoken of, but to let us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand they have a Power to <hi>Help</hi> and <hi>Assist</hi>? For what is their Reigning to their Praying for us? But I have a further Argument to prove the Council meant more, <hi>viz.</hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil knew the common Practices and Forms of Invocation then used and allowed, and the general Opinion, that the Saints had power to Help and Assist those who prayed to them. If the Council did not approve this, why did it insert the very words upon which that Practice was grounded? They likewise very well knew the Complaints which had
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60203:17"/>
been made of these things; and some of their own Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion cried shame upon some of their Hymns. <hi>Wicelius</hi> saith, one of them,<note place="margin">Wicel. <hi>in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencho Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suum.</hi>
               </note>

In all that time, the <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Hymns</hi> might easily have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to the <hi>Sense of the Church,</hi> if that were truly so. But instead of that, a very late French Writer cries out <hi>of the necessity of Reforming the Breviaries as to these things</hi>; wherein he confesses, <hi>Many Hymns are still remaining, wherein those things are asked of Saints, which ought to be asked of God alone; as being delivered from the Chains of our Sins, being preserved from Spiritual Maladies, and Hell-Fire; being inflamed with Charity, and made fit for Heaven. In good Conscience,</hi> saith he, <hi>is not this joyning the Saints with God himself, to ask those things of them which God alone can give?</hi> And whatever Men talk of <hi>the Sense of the Church,</hi> he confesses, <hi>the very Forms, and natural Sense of the Words; do raise another Idea in Mens minds; which ought to be prevented.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But doth not the Roman Catechism explain this to be the Sense of the Church?</hi>

And I cannot find any necessity from thence of putting this Sense upon them. I grant in one place, where it explains <hi>the difference of the Invocation of God and Saints,</hi> it saith, <hi>We are to pray to God as the Giver, and to Saints that they would obtain things of God for us</hi>; and then it adds, <hi>the Forms differ, that to God</hi> is, <hi>Miserere Nobis,</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di Nos</hi>; that to Saints is, <hi>Ora pro Nobis.</hi> Very well!

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60203:17"/>
is there then no other Form owned or allowed in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to Saints besides this?

But it adds, <hi>that the Saints are very pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful</hi>; then surely we are encouraged to pray to them for <hi>Help and Pity.

               </note> and we may pray to them for what is in their Power: For where it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to give an exact Account of the Reason of <hi>Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Saints and Angels</hi>; it there parallels them with <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates under a King</hi>; and saith, <hi>they are Gods Ministers in governing the Church; Invocandi itaque sunt quod &amp; perpetuo Deum intuentur, &amp; Patrocinium Salutis nostrae libentissimè susci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piunt.</hi> What is this <hi>Patrocinium salutis nostrae?</hi> Is it only <hi>Praying and Intercession with God?</hi> That cannot be, for it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances presently in <hi>Deliverances by Angels, and</hi> Jacob<hi>'s pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Angel to bless him,</hi> and not meerly to intercede for him. <hi>But though this is spoken of Angels,</hi> yet from hence it infers <hi>the Invocation of Saints</hi> too. But what need we insist more on this, since they do own the <hi>Ministry of Saints</hi> as well as Angels, with respect to the Church; and do <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize Saints</hi> for particular Countries, as lately <hi>S. Rosa</hi> for <hi>Peru.</hi> And where there is such a particular Protection sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, what incongruity is it to interpret the Form of their Prayers, according to a Doctrine so received and allowed? But of this more under the next Head.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He confesses that we are all redeemed by the Blood of Christ alone, and that he is our only Mediator of Redemption; but as for Mediators of Intercession, he doth not doubt but it is acceptable with God we should have many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would ask, concerning this Distinction, the Question which <hi>Christ</hi> asked concerning <hi>Iohn</hi>'s <hi>Baptism, Is it from Heaven, or of Man?</hi> No doubt there may be such a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of <hi>Mediators,</hi> if God please to make them. But
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60203:18"/>
who hath Authority to appoint <hi>Mediators</hi> with him besides himself? Is it not usurping his Prerogative, to appoint the great Officers of his Kingdom for him? Would any Prince upon Earth allow this, <hi>viz.</hi> when he hath absolutely decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Pleasure, that his own Son should present Petitions to him, that others shall take upon them to set up Masters of Requests themselves?<note place="margin">John 14.13, 14, 16, 23, 24. Heb. 7.25. &amp; 9.7, 24. 1 Jo. 2.1.</note> Can any thing be plainer in the New Testament, than that God hath appointed the <hi>Mediator</hi> of <hi>Redemption,</hi> to be our <hi>Mediator</hi> of <hi>Intercession?</hi> And that his <hi>Intercession</hi> is founded upon his <hi>Redemption.</hi> As the <hi>High Priest</hi>'s going into the <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> to intercede for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was upon the <hi>Blood of the Sacrifice of Expiation,</hi> which he carried in with him. If there were no Revelation in this Matter, there might be some reason for it. But since the Revelation is so clear in it, this Distinction looks just like the <hi>Socinians</hi> Distinction of a <hi>God by Nature,</hi> and a <hi>God by Office</hi>; which was framed on purpose to avoid the plain Texts of Scripture which called Christ <hi>God.</hi> So doth this look as if it were intended to avoid that clear Text, which saith,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.5.</note> 
               <hi>There is one Mediator between God and Men, the Man Christ Iesus.</hi> Which is presently answered with this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction; although there be not the least ground in that or any other Text for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yes,</hi> saith our Author, Moses <hi>was such a Mediator for the Israelites</hi>; Job <hi>for his three Friends</hi>; Stephen <hi>for his Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors: The Romans were desired by S.</hi> Paul <hi>to be his Mediator, and the</hi> Corinthians <hi>and</hi> Ephesians; <hi>so almost every sick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son desires the Congregation to be his Mediator, that is, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred in their Prayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But is there no difference between Men praying for one another, and desiring others to pray for them here on Earth, and an <hi>humble Invocation</hi> of the <hi>Saints in Heaven</hi> to be our <hi>Mediators</hi> of <hi>Intercession</hi> with God there?</p>
            <p>There is a threefold disparity in the Case.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Here upon Earth we converse with one another as Fellow Creatures, and there is no danger of our having an Opinion thereby, that were able to assist one another any other way than by our Prayers. But the case is very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent as to the Saints in Heaven, who by being addressed to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60203:18"/>
there by such solemn Invocation, may too easily be conceived to have the Power of bestowing such Blessings upon those who call upon them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Heaven is looked upon by all Mankind who direct their Devotions thither, as the particular Throne of God, where he dwells, and discovers himself after another manner than he doth upon the Earth. And we are directed to pray to our <hi>Father in Heaven</hi>; where he is represented as infinitely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all his Creatures; and the great Concernment of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is, to keep up the apprehension of this distance between him and them. Now it is hardly possible to keep it up, if in the Publick Offices of Religion; in the solemnest postures of Devotion, with Eyes lifted up to Heaven, they do make Addresses, both to God and to his Creatures.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Men are sure, when they pray to others on Earth to pray for them, that they do no more than they can justifie in point of Discretion, when they speak or write to those that can understand what their desire is: But no man on Earth can be certain that the Saints in Heaven can do it: For it is agreed they cannot do it without Revelation, and no Man can be assured there is a Revelation; and it is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to expect it; for they pray to Saints to pray to God for them, and they cannot tell what they pray for, unless God to whom they are to pray, reveal to them what it is they must pray to him for. Is it not then the better, the safer, the wiser way, to make our Prayers to him, who we are sure is able to hear and help us; and hath promised to grant what we ask in his Son's Name? But there is no <hi>other Name,</hi> either <hi>under Heaven,</hi> or <hi>in Heaven,</hi> whereby <hi>we can be saved,</hi> or our Prayers accepted, but his alone.</p>
            <p>But our Author saith, <hi>It is no part of his Faith, how the Saints in Heaven know the Prayers and Necessities of such who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress themselves to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how comes it to be any part of his Faith, that they know them? <hi>However he doth not doubt but God can never want means of letting the Saints know them.</hi> And is this a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground for solemn Invocation of Saints? God doth not want Means to let the Emperor of <hi>Iapan</hi> know a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest any one here hath to make to him; but is this a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Ground, for him at this distance to make it to him?
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60203:19"/>
God doth not want Means to let the Pope know what a mighty Service it would be to the Christian World, to make a wise and truly Christian-Reformation in the Church; but would this be a Ground sufficient for me at this Distance, to make a Speech to him about it? I knew a Man who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood not a word of Latin, but yet would needs go to hear a Latin Sermon: some asked him afterwards, what he meant by it; and the chief Reason he gave was much like this, <hi>God did not want Means to let him know what the Preacher meant</hi>:</p>
            <p>But after all, Suppose <hi>God should make known to the Saints what is desired of them</hi>; I ask, Whether this be sufficient Ground for solemn Invocation, when <hi>Socinus</hi> was not able to defend the <hi>Invocation of Christ himself,</hi> supposing that he could know our Hearts only by Relation? And he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing material to say, but only that there was a Command for it; which can never be so much as pretended in this Case.</p>
            <p>As to what he alledges of <hi>the Elders falling down before the Lamb, having Vials full of Odours, which are the Prayers of the Saints, Apoc.</hi> 5.8. It must be strained hard to be brought to this purpose, when both Ancient and Modern Interpreters take it for a Representation of what was done upon Earth, and not in Heaven. And if it were in Heaven, Prophetical Visions were never intended for a Measure of our Duties. <hi>If the Angels do pray for Mankind,</hi> Zech. 1.12. Doth it therefore follow we must pray to them? But we say as the Angel did to S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> Revel. 19.10. in a like Case; <hi>See thou do it not: worship God.</hi>

            <p>I grant it.

               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:60203:20"/>
and the whole design of it,<note place="margin">

            <p>Here I have reason to enquire, Whether the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> then, according to the sense of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> be only a <hi>Mediatrix</hi> of <hi>Intercession</hi> or not, since so large Power and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion is attributed to her? And why should not her Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants go beyond an <hi>Ora pro nobis,</hi> if this Doctrine be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; as it must be, if the contrary cannot be endured? For that Author allowed her <hi>Intercession,</hi> and <hi>Prayer to her</hi> on that account;<note place="margin">

               <note place="margin">Pag. 4.</note> What can be said more of the Son of God in our Nature?

            <p n="1">1. <hi>In having an inward, cordial and passionate value of the Maternity of</hi> Mary, <hi>and all other Excellencies proper to, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable from the Mother of God.</hi>

            <p>I think I need mention no more; only three things I shall observe; (1.)

(2.) That this is published in English, that our People, as well as theirs, may be convinced how far we have been from unjust charging them as to such things as these. (3.) That at the same time they plead for keeping the Bible out of the hands of the People, wherein their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion is so far to be commended, since the Scripture, and this new Scheme of Devotion, can never stand together. There being not one word in the Bible towards it, but very much against it; and the Psalms and Hymns must be <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesq'd</hi> to found that way.</p>
            <p>But what saith our Author to their <hi>Rosaries,</hi> wherein there are <hi>ten Ave Maries to one Pater noster</hi>; which is accounted a special piece of Devotion; and great things are said of the Effects of it by <hi>Alanus de Rupe,</hi> and many others.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>Ave Maries,</hi> he saith, <hi>there is no more Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to God in reciting the Angelical Salutation, than in the first pronouncing it by the Angel</hi> Gabriel <hi>and</hi> Elizabeth. But it may not be altogether so pertinent. But doth he really
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60203:22"/>
think they said the whole <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> as it is used among them? Did the Angel and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> say, <hi>Sancta Maria, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Dei, ora pro nobis peccatoribus, nunc &amp; in hora mortis nostrae?</hi> If not, to what purpose are they mentioned here?</p>
            <p n="2">2. As <hi>to the Repetition</hi>; that, he saith, <hi>is no more an idle Superstition, than</hi> David<hi>'s repeating the same words</hi> 26 <hi>times in the</hi> 136. <hi>Psalm.</hi> But what is this to the Question, <hi>why more Supplications to the blessed Virgin than to Christ?</hi> And not one word of Answer is given to it.

            <head>IV. Of paying Divine Worship to Reliques.</head>
            <p>FOR the right understanding this Controversie, we are to consider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there is a due Veneration to the Bodies of Saints and Martyrs, allowed on both sides; and there is an undue Worship of them, which is disowned on both sides. The due Veneration is, a Religious Decency to be observed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them; which lies in avoiding any thing like Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt or Dishonour to them, and using all such Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Respect and Decency, which becomes the Remains of Excellent Persons; provided we are satisfied of their Sincerity, without having recourse to Divine Omnipotency to prove them: which <hi>Ferrandus</hi> the Jesuit runs so much to,<note place="margin">Ferrandi <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitio Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiaria.</hi>
               </note> to prove the Truth of many Reliques, worshipped in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in many places at once. But that it is possible to exceed in the Worship of true Reliques, even <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confesseth, who says, <hi>that God took away the Body of</hi> Moses, <hi>lest the People should give Divine Worship to it.</hi> And S. <hi>Ierom,</hi> as hot as he was against <hi>Vigilantius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>De Imag. sanct l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</note> yet he utterly denied giving any Adoration to the Reliques of Martyrs. It seems then it is very possible to exceed that way.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Question then is, Whether those Acts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship which are allowed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> do not go beyond due Veneration? For it is unreasonable to suppose those who give it, to believe those Reliques to be Gods;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60203:23"/>
and therefore it must be such a Worship as is given to them, supposing them to be only Reliques of such Persons. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> decrees Honour and Veneration to be given to them, but never determines what is due, and what not: it forbids all Excesses in drinking and eating, in the visiting of Reliques; but not a word of Excesses in worshipping of them, unless it be comprehended under the name of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition. But <hi>Superstition</hi> lies in something forbidden, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their notion of it: therefore, if there be no Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition by the Church, there can be no Superstition in the Worship of them. And if they had thought there had been any in the known Practices of the Church, they would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have mentioned them; and because they did not, we ought in reason to look on them as allowed. And yet not only <hi>Cassander</hi> complains of the great Superstition about them;<note place="margin">

            <p>But what saith our <hi>Representer</hi> to them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He believes it damnable to think there's any Divinity in the Reliques of Saints, or to adore them with Divine Honour.</hi> But what is this adoring them with Divine Honour? A true Representer ought to have told us what he meant by it, when the whole Controversie depends upon it. Is it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly saying Mass to Reliques, or believing them to be Gods? Is there no giving Divine Honour by Prostration, burning of Incense, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nothing in expecting help from them? Yes, <hi>If it be from any hidden Power of their own.</hi> But here is a very hard Question: If a Man doth not believe it to be an intrinsick Power in the Reliques, may a Man safely go to them. <hi>Opis impetrandae causâ,</hi> as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> saith, in hopes of Relief from them? Is it not possible for the Devil to appear with <hi>Samuel</hi>'s true Body, and make use of the Relique of a Saint to a very bad end? Then, say I, no Reliques can secure Men against the Imposture of Evil Spirits, who, by God's Permission, may do strange things with the very Reliques of Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But God hath visibly worked by them,</hi> saith our Author, <hi>by making them Instruments of many Miracles; and it is as easie for him to do it now.</hi> This is the force of all he saith. To which I answer.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:60203:23"/>1. It is a very bold thing to call in God's Omnipotency, where God himself hath never declared he will use his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; for it is under his own Command, and not ours.

But where he saith, <hi>It is as much for the Honour of God's Name to work such Miracles now</hi>; their own Authors will tell him the contrary; and that there is no such Reason now, as in former times, when Religion was to be confirmed by them; and when Martyrs suffered upon the sole account of the Truth of it; and therefore their Reputation had a greater Influence upon converting the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Suppose it be granted, yet it proves not any Religious Worship to be given to them. For I shall seriously ask an important Question: Whether they do really believe, any greater Miracles have ever been done by Reliques, than were done by the Brazen Serpent? And yet, although that was set up by God's own Appointment, when it began to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shorshipped after an undue manner; it was thought fit by <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to be broken in pieces. What now was the undue Worship they gave to it? Did they believe the Serpent, which could neither move nor understand, was it self a God? <hi>But they did burn Incense to it.</hi> And did that make a God of it? Suppose Men burn Incense to Reliques; What then, are they made Gods presently? Suppose they do not, but place them upon Altars, carry them in Procession, fall down before them, with intention to shew the Honour they do them; are not these as much as burning a little Incense, which could not signify so much Honour as the other do? and it is hard then to make the one unlawful, and not the other.</p>

               <p>HE believes it unlawful to commit Idolatry; and most damnable to Worship or Adore any <hi>Breaden God,</hi> or to give Divine Honour to any Elements of Bread and Wine. He worships only one God, who made Heaven and Earth, and his only Son Jesus Christ our Redeemer; who, being in all things equal to his Father, in Truth and Omnipotency, he believes, made his words good, pronounc'd at his last Supper; really giving his Body and Blood to his Apostles; the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Bread and Wine being by his powerful Words chang'd into his own Body and Blood, the <hi>Species</hi> or Accidents of the Bread and Wine remaining as before. The same he believes of the most Holy Sacrament of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> consecrated now by Priests: That it really contains the Body of Christ, which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd for us; and his Blood, which was shed for the remission of sins: Which being there united with the <hi>Divinity,</hi> he confesses <hi>Whole Christ</hi> to be present.

               <head>I. Of the Adoration of the Host.</head>
               <p n="1">1. The Question is far enough from being, Whether it be lawful to commit Idolatry? as our <hi>Representer</hi> puts it. For the <hi>Misrepresenter</hi> saith, <hi>That a Papist believes it lawful to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Idolatry:</hi> and to clear this, our Author gravely saith, <hi>He believes it unlawful to commit Idolatry.</hi> pag. 9. As though any Men ever owned it to be lawful: Which is, as if the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion were, Whether such a Man committed Adultery, and he should think to clear himself by saying, he believed it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to commit Adultery.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Question is not, Whether Christ may be lawfully adored by us in the Celebration of the Eucharist; which we are so far from denying, that our Church requires our recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it in the posture of Adoration.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The true Question is, Whether the Body of Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing supposed to be present in the Host by Transubstantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be a sufficient ground to give the same Adoration to the Host, which they would do to the Person of Christ.</p>
               <p>And that this is the true state of the Question, will appear by these things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> first defined Transubstantiation, and from thence inferrred <hi>Adoration of the Host</hi>; as is most evident to any one that will read the fourth and fifth De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Thirteenth Session. <hi>Nullus itaque dub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tandi locus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i.e.</hi> If Transubstantiation be true, then Adoration fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. It's true, the sixth Canon only speaks of <hi>Christ being there worshipped</hi>; but that ought to be compared with the first, second, and fourth Canons, where the Doctrine of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation</hi> is fully set down, as the Foundation of that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Adoration</hi> is not fixed on the <hi>Person of Christ, as separate from the Host,</hi> but as making <hi>one Object</hi> of Worship together with it. And so the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> declares in the sixth Decree; when it saith, <hi>The Sacrament is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to be adored, because it was instituted to be received</hi> This cannot be otherwise understood, than as relating to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: and so <hi>that</hi> whatever it be, must be granted to be the Object of Adoration. <hi>By the Sacrament, saith Cardinal</hi> Pallavicini,<note place="margin">Pallavicin. <hi>his.. Concil. Trident.</hi> l. 12. c. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>is understood the Object made up of the Body of Christ, and the Accidents.</hi> The Worship then being confessed to be
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60203:25"/>
Adoration, which is due to God alone, and that Adoration directed to the Sacrament as its proper Object; the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on now is, Whether such a Supposition in the Sacrament, doth justifie that Adoration?</p>
               <p>Our Author saith, <hi>He accounteth it most damnable to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship or adore any Breaden God, or to give Divine Honour to any Elements of Bread and Wine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then, I say, by his own confession, if it be only Bread, he commits Idolatry; for the Adoration he cannot deny. But our <hi>Representer</hi> loves ambiguous Expressions, which to the People sound very well, but have no sincere meaning: for what is it he understands by his <hi>Breaden God?</hi> If it be that he worships a God, which himself supposes to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Bread, we do not charge him with it; but if it be what we believe it to be, the Substance of Bread, but himself believes to be turned into the Body of Christ, then he cannot deny his Adoration to be given to it.</p>
               <p>All that can excuse them is, the Supposition; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that will or not, is now to be consider'd.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If it be not true, themselves grant it to be Idolatry. The Testimonies of Bishop <hi>Fisher,</hi> and <hi>Costerus,</hi>

Enchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid.</hi> c. 8. n. 10.</note> are so well known to this purpose, that I shall not repeat them. And <hi>Catharinus,</hi> a Divine of Note in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses it is Idolatry to worship an unconsecrated Host, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Person, through a Mistake, believes it conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated. And he quotes Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Paludanus</hi> for his Opinion; and gives this Reason for it;<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Because Christ is not worshipped simply in the Sacrament, but as he is under the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; and therefore if he be not so present, a Creature hath Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship given it. As those were guilty of Idolatry, who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped any Creatures of old, supposing God to be there, as that he was the Soul of the World. They were not excused,</hi> saith he, <hi>that they thought they worshipped but one God; because they worshipped him as present in such a manner, as he was not.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. If <hi>the Bread were taken to be God,</hi> our Author doth not deny it would be Idolatry, for that were to worship a Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den God. Yet here would be a Mistake, and a gross one; yet this Mistake would not excuse the Persons committing it
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60203:26"/>
from most damnable Idolatry, as he confesses: Why then should the other Mistake excuse them, when they suppose the Substance of the Bread not to be there, but the Body of Christ to be under the Species? <hi>Yes,</hi> say they, <hi>then no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is supposed to be the Object of Worship.</hi> But when the Bread is supposed to be God, it must be supposed not to be a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. There is no Answer to be given in this Case, <hi>but that the Bread really is a Creature, whatsoever they imagined</hi>; and if this Mistake did not excuse, neither can the other.</p>

               <head>II. Of Transubstantiation.</head>
               <p>Three things our Author goes upon, with respect to this.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. He supposes Christ's words to be clear for it.</item>
                  <item>2. He shews the possibility of it, from Gods Omnipotency.</item>
                  <item>3. He argues against the Testimony or Evidence of Sense or Reason in this Case, from some parallel Instances, as he thinks.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He believes Iesus Christ made his Words good, pronounced at his last Supper, really giving his Body and Blood to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles? the Substance of Bread and Wine being, by his powerful Words, changed into his own Body and Blood; the Species only, or Accidents of the Bread and Wine, remaining as before. The same he believes of the Eucharist consecrated now by Priests.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a very easie way, of taking it for granted that the words are clear for Transubstantiation. And from no better Ground, to fly to God's Omnipotency to make it good, is as if one should suppose Christ really to be turned into a Rock, a Vine, a Door; because the words are every jot as clear, and then call in Gods Omnipotency, which is as effectual to make them good. I confess, these words are so far from being clear to me for Transubstantiation, that if I had never heard of it, I should never have thought of it, from these or any other words of Scripture, <hi>i.e.</hi> not barely considering the sound of words, but the Eastern Idioms of speaking; the Circumstances of our Saviour's real Body at that time when he spake them; the uncouth way of feeding on Christ's real Body, without any Objection made against it by his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; the Key our Saviour elsewhere gives for understanding the manner of eating his Flesh; and withal, if these words be literally and strictly understood, they must make the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60203:26"/>
Substance of Bread to be Christ's Body; for that is una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably the literal sense of the words. For can any Men take <hi>This</hi> to be any thing but this Bread, who attend to the common sense and meaning of Words, and the strict Rules of Interpretation? Yet this sense will by no means be allow'd; for then all that can be infer'd from these words is, that when Christ spake these words. <hi>The Bread was his Body.</hi> But either Christ meant the <hi>Bread</hi> by <hi>This,</hi> or he did not; if he did, the former Proposition is unavoidable in the literal sense; if he did not, then by vertue of these words, the Bread could never be turned into the Body of Christ. For that only could be made the Body of Christ which was meant, when Christ said, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> This seems to me to be as plain and convincing as any Demonstration in <hi>Euclid.</hi> Which hath often made me wonder at those who talk so confidently of the plain Letter of Scripture, being for this Doctrine of Transubstantiation. But several Divines of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> understood themselves better, and have confessed, that this Doctrine could not be drawn out of the literal sense of these words; as it were easie to shew, if it had not been late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done already. It is enough here to observe, that <hi>Vasquez</hi> confesseth it of <hi>Scotus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vasq. in</hi> 3 <hi>part. Disc.</hi> 180. <hi>Q.</hi> 75 <hi>Art.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Durandus, Paludanus, Ockam, Camera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censis</hi>; and himself yields that they do not, and cannot signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie expresly the Change of the Bread and Wine into the Body of Christ. For how can, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> literally signifie, this is changed into my Body? If that Proposition were lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally true, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> it overthrows the Change; For how can a thing be changed into that which it is already?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He believes Christ being equal to his Father in Truth and Omnipotency, can make his words good.</hi> We do not in the least dispute Christ's Omnipotency, but we may their familiar way of making use of it to help them out, when Sense and Reason fail them. And therefore <hi>Cajetan</hi> well said;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cajetan. in</hi> 3 <hi>Part. Q.</hi> 75. <hi>Art.</hi> 1, 2, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>We ought not to dispute about Gods Absolute Power in the Doctrine of the Sacraments, being things of such constant use; and that it is a foolish thing to attribute to the Sacrament all that God can do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we must consider what he saith against <hi>Sense and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. For the believing this Mystery, he does not at all think it meet for any Christian to appeal from Christs Words, to his own
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60203:27"/>
Senses or Reason, for the examining the Truth of what he hath said, but rather to submit his Senses and Reason to Christ's Words in the obsequiousness of Faith.</hi> What! whether we know this to be the meaning of Christ's Words, or not? And thus we shall be bound to submit to every absurd Interpretation of Scripture, because we must not use our Senses or Reason for examining the Truth of what is said there. Can any thing be plainer said in Scripture, than that God hath Eyes and Ears, and Hands? Must now every Man yield to this <hi>in the obsequiousness of Faith,</hi> without examining it by Principles of common Reason? And we think we are therefore bound to put another Sense upon those Expressions, because they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a Repugnancy to the Divine Perfections. Why not then where something is implied which is repugnant to the Nature of Christ's Body, as well as to our Senses? But the Question about judging in this matter by our Senses, is not, as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is willing to suppose, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether our Senses are to be believed, against a clear and express Divine Revelation; but whether the Judgment of our Senses and Reason is not to be made use of for finding out the true sense of this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation? And we think there is great reason for it.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Because we have no more certain way of judging the Substance of a Body, than by our Senses. We do not say our Senses go beyond the Accidents; but we say, our Senses, by those Accidents, do assure us of the bodily Substance, or else it were impossible for us to know there is any such thing in the world.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Because Christ did himself appeal to the Judgment of his Disciples Senses concerning the Truth of his own Body after the Resurrection; <hi>Behold my Hands and my Feet, that it is I my self:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">S. Luk. 24.39.</note> 
                  <hi>handle and see, for a Spirit hath not Flesh and Bones, as ye see me have.</hi> Now we think we have reason to allow the same <hi>Criterion</hi> which Christ himself did about the very same Body. Unless he had then told his Disciples, that there was to be <hi>another supernatural manner of Existence</hi> of the same Body, concerning which their Senses were not to be Judges.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Some of the most important Articles of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith do suppose the Judgment of our Senses to be true. As about the Truth of Christ's Body; whether he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60203:27"/>
a Body, or only the outward Accidents and Appearance of a Body? if he had not, he did not really suffer upon the Cross, and so the Sacrifice of Propitiation there offered up to the Father for the sins of mankind, is lost. There was a great Controversy in St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s time, and afterwards, Whether Christ had any real Body? Those who denied it, brought Revelation for it; those who asserted it, proved it by their Senses, as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> himself,<note place="margin">1 S. John. 1.1, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>That which we have seen, and heard, and our hands have handled, &amp;c.</hi> He doth not tell men, they must submit their Sense and Reason to the pretence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation; but they ought to adhere to the Judgment of their Senses concerning the Reality of Christ's Body. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ himself appealed to it, the Apostles made use of it, without any caution or limitation, we have great reason to rely still on the Judgment of our Senses concerning the same Object, <hi>viz.</hi> the Body of Christ.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But we must now consider his Instances to overthrow the Iudgment of our Senses and Reason in this Point.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He believes Christ to be God, though to Senses he seemed nothing but Man.</hi> Do we ever pretend to judge of Christ's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity by our Senses? How then can this be pertinent, when our only Dispute is about judging his Body, and the substance of Bread and Wine by them? And yet the Senses were of great use as to the proof of his Divinity by the Miracles which he wrought? which if they had been like the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Miracles in Transubstantiation, could have convinced no man, because they could never see them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He believes the Holy Ghost descended on our Saviour, tho Senses or Reason could discover it to be nothing but a Dove.</hi> If there were no reason to judge otherwise, the Judgment of Sense were to be followed: but since the Scripture declares it was the Holy Ghost descending as a Dove, we have no reason to question that Revelation. For we do not pretend that our Senses are so far Judges of Divine Appearances, as to exclude the possibility of God's assuming the shape and figure of his Creature when he pleases, by moulding the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of a real Body into such a Representation. Thus we do not deny the possibility of an appearance of the Holy Ghost under Bread and Wine, if God thought fit, any more than under a Dove; and in this Case we do not pretend

that our Senses can exclude the presence of a Spirit under the Elements; but that is very different from the present Case, for here the Substance is supposed to be gone, and nothing but Accidents remaining; and no spiritual Presence of Christ is denied, but that of his Body, the very same Body which suffered on the Cross.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>He believes the Man who appeared to</hi> Joshua, (<hi>ch.</hi> 5 13.) <hi>and the three Men to</hi> Abraham, (Gen. 18.) <hi>were really and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially no Men, notwithstanding all the Information and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Sens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> to the contrary, from their Colour, Features, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, Talking, Eating, and many others.</hi> And what follows from hence, but that Spiritual Invisible Substances may be under the appearance of Bodies, and that our Senses cannot be Judges of them? Which is not our Question, but Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bodies can be so present after the manner of Spirits, as to lose all the natural Properties of Bodies? and whether a Material Substance can be lost, under all the Accidents pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to it, so as our Senses cannot be proper Judges of one by the other?</p>
               <p>But our Author seems to grant this, in a natural way of the Existence of a Body: but he saith, <hi>Christ gives to his Body a supernatural manner of Existence, by which being left without extension of Parts, and rendred independent of Place, it may be one and the same in many places at once, and whole in every part of the Symbols, and not obnoxious to any corporeal contingencies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is to me a Mystery beyond all comprehension by Sense or Reason; and there is certainly a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween governing our Understandings, and giving them up, as we must do if this Doctrine hold good; for it overthrows any fixed Principles of Reason in mankind concerning the Nature and Properties of Bodies.</p>
               <p>For, 1. We must still suppose the Body of Christ to be the very same individual Body which suffered upon the Cross; but if it had no extension of Parts, and be reckoned inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon Place, it ceaseth to be a Body. It is granted, that after a natural way of Existence, a B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dy cannot be in more places than one: but let the way of Existence be what it will, if it be a body, it must be finite; if finite, it must be limited and circumscribed; if it be circumscribed within one place, it cannot be in more places, for that is to make it cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribed,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60203:28"/>
and not circumscribed; undivided from it self, and divided from it self at the same time. Which is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Contradiction, which doth not depend only on Quantity or Extension, but upon the essential Unity of a Body.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it be possible for a Body to be in several places by <hi>a supernatural Existence</hi>; why may not the same Body be in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places by <hi>a natural Existence</hi>? Is it not because Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Circumscription are so necessary to it, that in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Way it can be but in one Place? Then it follows that these are essential Properties of Bodies; so that no true Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy can be conceived without them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This <hi>Supernatural Existence</hi> doth not hinder the Body's being individually present in one place: My meaning is this; A Priest Consecrates an Host at <hi>London,</hi> and another at <hi>York</hi>; is the Body of Christ at <hi>London,</hi> so present there by virtue of Consecration, as to be present at <hi>York</hi> too, by this <hi>Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Existence?</hi> What then doth the Consecration at <hi>York</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce? If it be not, then its Presence is limited to the Host, where the Consecration is made; and if it be so limited, then this <hi>supernatural Existence</hi> cannot take off its relation to place.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The same Body would be liable to the greatest Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions imaginable: For the same Body after this <hi>supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral way of Existence,</hi> may not only be above and below, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and without, near and far off from it self: but it may be hot and cold, dead and alive; yea, in Heaven and Hell at once.</p>
               <p n="5">5. What is it that makes it still a Body after this <hi>superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural way of Existence,</hi> &amp;c. if it lose extension and dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on place? If it be only an aptitude to extension, when that <hi>supernatural Existence</hi> is taken off, then it must either be without quantity, or with it. If it be without quantity, how can it be a Body? if with quantity, how is it possible to be without Extension?</p>
               <p n="6">6. This confounds all the differences of Greater and Less, as well as of Distance and Nearness. For upon this Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, a thing really greater may be contained within a less: for the whole Organical Body of Christ, with all its parts, may be brought within the compass of a Wafer; and the whole be in every part without any distance between Head and Feet.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:60203:29"/>7. This makes Christ to have but one Body, and yet to have as many Bodies as there are consecrated Hosts. No, saith our Author, <hi>This supernatural manner of Existence is without danger of multiplying his Body, or making as many Christs as Altars.</hi> But how this can be, is past all humane Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing: For every Consecration hath its Effect, which is supposed to be the Conversion of the Substance of the Bread into the Body of Christ. Now, when a Priest at <hi>London</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts the Bread into the Body of Christ there, he doth it not into the Body of Christ at <hi>York,</hi> but the Priest there doth it; therefore the Body of Christ at <hi>London,</hi> is different from that at <hi>York</hi>; or else the Conversion at <hi>London</hi> would be into the Body, as at <hi>York.</hi> But if not, what is the substantial Term of this substantial Change, where nothing but an accidental Mode doth follow? If there be any such Term, whether that must not be a production of something which was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and if it be so, Christ must have as many new Bodies, as there are Consecrations.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This makes that which hath no particular Subsistence of its own, to be the Subject of a substantial Change; for this is the condition of Christ's Body, whatever its manner of Existence be, after the Hypostatical Union to the Divine Nature. For, when <hi>Bellarmin, Petavius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bellarm. <hi>de Incarn. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 8. Petav. <hi>de In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnatione p.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 1. §. 3.</note> and others of their greatest Divines, undertake, against <hi>Nestorius,</hi> to explain the Hypostatical Union, they tell us it consists in this, that the human Nature loseth its proper Subsistence, and is assumed into the Subsistence of the Divine Nature. From whence I infer, That the Body of Christ, having no proper Subsistence of its own, there can be no substantial Change into that which hath no proper subsistence, but into that which hath; and consequently the Change must be into the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture principally; from whence it will follow, the Elements losing their Subsistence, upon Consecration the Divinity must be united hypostatically to them, as to the human Nature; and so there will be as many Hypostatical Unions, as there are Consecrations. And so this Doctrine not only confounds Sense and Reason, but the Mysteries of Christ's Incarnation too: Which I think is sufficient for this Head.</p>

'Tis his Faith to believe, That of our selves we are not sufficient, so much as to think a good thought, that the Grace by which we are justified, is given us purely <hi>gratis</hi> upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Christs Merits; moreover, that no Man, how just soever, can merit any thing, either in this life, or in that to come, independant on the Merits &amp; Passion of Jesus Christ.

            <head>VI. Of Merits and good Works.</head>
            <p>FOr the true stating this Controversie, we are to observe:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we do not charge those of the Church of <hi>Rome,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60203:30"/>
That they belive Christ's Death and Passion to be ineffectual and insignificant, and that they have no dependence on the Merits of his Sufferings, or the Mercy of God for attaining Salvation; but that they are to be saved only by their own Merits and Good Works</hi>; as the Misrepresenter saith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We do not charge them with denying the <hi>Necessity of Divine Grace in order to merit; or with asserting that they can merit independently thereupon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We do by no means dispute about the <hi>Necessity of Good Works,</hi> in order to the Reward of another Life; or assert that Christ's Merits will save Men without <hi>working out their own Salvation</hi>; but do firmly believe, that <hi>God will judg Men according to their Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Question then is, <hi>Whether the Good Works of a just Man,</hi> as our Author expresses it, <hi>are truly meritorious of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life?</hi> Which he affirms, but qualifies with saying, <hi>That they proceed from Grace, and that through Gods Goodness and Promise, they are truly meritorious.</hi> But the Council of <hi>Trent denounces an Anathema against those who deny the Good Works of justified Persons,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Concil. Trident Sess.</hi> 6. <hi>Can.</hi> 32.</note> 
               <hi>to be truly meritorious of the increase of Grace, and of eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here then lie the Points in difference, (1.) Whether such Good Works can be said to be <hi>truly meritorious</hi>? (2.) Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those who deny it, deserve an <hi>Anathema</hi> for so doing? As to what relates to <hi>Gods Acceptance and Allowance, and his Goodness and Promise,</hi> we freely own all that he saith about it; and if no more be meant, what need an <hi>Anathema</hi> about this matter? There must therefore be something beyond this, when Good Works are not only said to be <hi>truly meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious,</hi> but we are cursed if we do not say the same.</p>
            <p>To make any thing <hi>truly meritorious,</hi> we must suppose these Conditions requisite.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That what we pretend to merit by, be our own free act.</item>
               <item>2. That it be not defective.</item>
               <item>3. That there be an Equality between it, and the Reward due to it.</item>
               <item>4. That there be an Obligation in point of Justice, to give that Reward to him that doth it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And from these Considerations, we deny that good Works, even of justified Persons, can be <hi>truly meritorious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:60203:30"/>1. It is granted by themselves, That what is <hi>truly merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,</hi> must be a free Act of the Person who doth it.<note place="margin">

Oper. c.</hi> 7.</note> Now the good Works of justified persons cannot be said to be their own free Acts, if the Power of doing them depend upon Divine Assistance, and there was an antecedent Obligation upon them to perform them: So that they can do nothing but what they are bound to, as God's Creatures; and their very Power of doing it is from the Grace of God. If Men pretended to merit at anothers hands by what God gives, there were some colour for it;<note place="margin">

If I ow a Man an 100 <hi>l.</hi> and another knowing me unable to pay it, gives me so much to pay the Debt, this is no more than what may be called strict Payment, as to the Creditor; but if the Creditor himself gives me this 100 <hi>l.</hi> to pay himself with, will any Man call this strict Payment? He may call it so himself, if he pleases, but that only shews his Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Favour; but it doth not look very modestly or gratefully, for the Debtor to insist upon it as <hi>true legal Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Just so it is in good Works done by the Power of God's Grace, which we could never have done without it; and therefore such cannot be <hi>truly meritorious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. What is <hi>truly meritorious</hi> must not be defective; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Proportion is to be equal between the Act, and the Reward due to it; which being perfect, requires that there be do Defect in the Acts which merit it. But this can never be said of Good Works of justified Persons, that they have no Defects in them. We do not say, they are not Good Works, but they are not exact and perfect: for although the Grace of God, as it comes from him, be a perfect Gift; yet as it acts upon Mens Minds, it doth not raise them to such a degree, but that they have Imperfections in their best Actions. And whatever is defective, is faulty; whatever is faulty, must be forgiven: whatever needs forgiveness, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>truly meritorious.</hi> But not only their Good Works are defective; but if they would merit, they ought to have none but Good Works, whereas the mixture of others ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the good uncapable of being <hi>meritorious,</hi> because there is so much to be pardoned, as takes away all claim of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> in the good they perform. And themselves do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60203:31"/>
that Men can merit the Grace of Remission; but it is very strange that those who cannot deserve to be forgiven, should deserve to have an infinite Reward bestowed upon them.</p>

               </note>3. There must be an exact Proportion between the Act and the Recompence: for to merit, is to pay a Price for a thing; and in such Acts of commutative Justice, there must be an Equality of one thing with another. But what Equality can there be between the imperfect Good Works of the best Men, and the most perfect Happiness of another World, especially when that consists in the fruition of the Beatifical Vision? For what Proportion can there be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Acts towards God, and God's Acts towards the Blessed in Heaven? Let the Acts be of what Person soever, or of what Nature soever, or from what Principle soever; as long as they are the Acts of finite imperfect Creatures, it is impossible there should be any Equality, or exact Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between them and the Eternal Favour of God, which is the Reward promised.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Where Acts are <hi>truly meritorious,</hi> there follows an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of strict Justice, to pay the Recompence due to them. But what strict Justice can there be between the Creator and his Creatures, to recompence the Service they are bound to perform; when their very Being, Power to act, Assistance in acting, and Recompence for it, are all from his Bounty and Goodness? But our Author would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void all this, by saying, that though Good Works are <hi>truly meritorious</hi>; yet it is <hi>through the Merits of Christ, and as they proceed from Grace, and through his Goodness and Promise that they are so; i. e.</hi> they are truly meritorious, because it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from all these things they neither are, nor can be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious. For,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) How come the Merits of Christ to make good Works <hi>truly meritorious</hi>? Are the Merits of Christ imputed to those Good Works? Then those Good Works must be as merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious as Christ's own Works; which I suppose he will not assert. Or, is it that Christ hath merited the Grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may merit? But even this will not make our personal Acts truly meritorious; and the Nature of Merit relates to the Acts, and not to the Power.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:60203:31"/>2. How comes the Power of Grace to make them <hi>truly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious</hi>; when the Power of Grace doth so much increase the Obligation on our side? If it be said, <hi>That the state of Grace puts men into a capacity to merit:</hi> we might more reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably infer the contrary, that it puts them out of a capacity of meriting; because the Remission of Sins, and the Favour of God, are things for which we can never make him any recompence.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) How comes a Divine Promise to make Acts truly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious? For God's Promise is an Act of meer kindness, which is very different from strict Justice: and although by the Promise God binds himself to performance; yet how come those Acts to be more meritorious of Heaven, than the Acts of Repentance are of Remission of Sins? Yet none will now say, that there can be any Acts meritorious of that. Yet certainly there is a clear promise of Pardon upon Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as there is of Heaven upon Good Works: And if the Promise in the other case doth not make Repentance merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of Pardon; how can it make Good Works truly meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious of Eternal Life? But notwithstanding, we do not deny God's Fidelity to his Promise may be called <hi>Iustice,</hi> and so God, as a <hi>Righteous Iudge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.8.</note> may give a <hi>Crown of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to all that follow St.</hi> Paul's <hi>Example,</hi> without making Good Works to be <hi>truly meritorious.</hi>

            <head>VII. Of Confession.</head>
            <p>WE do not charge the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that in the <hi>power of Absolving, they make Gods of Men,</hi> as our <hi>Misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senter pretends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2.

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We are glad to find that our Author declares, <hi>That no Man receives benefit by Absolution, without Repentance from the bottom of his Heart, and real intention of forsaking his Sins</hi>; by which we hope he means more than Attrition.</p>
            <p>But yet there are some things which stick with us, as to the Doctrine and Practicee of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this matter, which he takes no notice of.</p>

               <hi>That the desire of Confession is included in Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Which is impossible to be proved by Scripture, Reason, or Antiquity. For so lately, as in the time of the <hi>Master of the Sentences,</hi> and <hi>Gratian</hi> (in the 12<hi>th.</hi> Century) it was a very dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable Point, whether Confession to a Priest were necessary. And it is very hard for us to understand how that should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come necessary to Salvation since, which was not then. Some of their own Writers confess, that some good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks did not believe the necessity of it. I suppose the old Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonists may pass for good Catholicks; and yet <hi>Maldonat</hi> saith,<note place="margin">

               <hi>That all the Interpreters of the Decrees held, that there was no Divine Precept for Confession to a Priest</hi>; and of the same Opinion he grants <hi>Scotus</hi> to have been.

And all other Christians in the World besides those of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> do to this day reject the necessity of particular Confession to a Priest, in order to Remission, as the Writers of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> themselves confess. So <hi>Godignus</hi> doth of the <hi>Abyssins; Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus à SS. Trinitate,</hi> of the <hi>Iacobites; Clemens Galanus</hi> of the <hi>Nestorians,</hi> who saith, <hi>They made a Decree against the use of Confession to any but to God alone.</hi> And <hi>Alexius Meneses</hi> of the Christians of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> in the <hi>Indies.</hi> The Greeks believe Confession only to be of Positive and Ecclesiastical Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the late Author of the <hi>Critical History of the Faith and Customs of the Eastern Nations,</hi> proves. And the very Form of their Absolution declares, that they do not think particular Confession of all known Sins, necessary to pardon: for therein the Priest absolves the Penitent from <hi>the sins he hath not confessed through forgetfulness, or shame.</hi> And now let any one prove this to have been a Catholick Tradition by <hi>Vincentius</hi> his Rules, <hi>viz. That it hath been always received, every where, and by All.</hi>

And this he is taught to be grounded on the Judiciary Power, left by Christ in his <hi>Church,</hi> of <hi>binding and loosing:</hi> whereby Authority was given to erect a <hi>Court of Conscience,</hi> to assign Penalties or release them, as circumstances should reguire. And this Authority he knows S. <hi>Paul</hi> plainly own'd, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6.) where he decreed a Penance; <hi>Sufficient</hi> (says he) <hi>to such a man, is this punishment:</hi> And (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10.) where he released one; <hi>For your sake</hi> (speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Penance injoyn'd the incestuous <hi>Corinthian,) I forgive it in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ.</hi> And what <hi>Mony</hi> there is given at any time on this account, concerns not at all the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Coffers, but is by every one given as they please, either to the Poor, to the Sick, to Prisoners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherefore they judge it most Charity.

            <p n="1">1. THey must be extreamly ignorant, who take the Power of Indulgences, to be <hi>a Leave from the Pope to commit what Sins they please; and that by virtue thereof, they shall escape Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their Sins, without Repentance, in another World.</hi> Yet this is the sense of the Misrepresentation, which, he saith is made of it. And if he saith true in his Preface, <hi>That he hath described the Belief of a Papist, exactly according to the apprehension he had when he was a Protestant:</hi> He shews how well he understood the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in difference, when I think no other Person besides himself ever had such an apprehension of it, who pretended to be any thing like a Scholar.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>But now he believes it damnable to hold that the Pope, or any other Power in Heaven or Earth, can give him leave to commit any Sins whatsoever; or that for any Sum of Mony, he can obtain any Indulgence or Pardon for Sins that are to be committed by him, or his Heirs hereafter.</hi> Very well! But what thinks he of obtaining an Indulgence, or Pardon, after they are committed? Is no such thing to be obtained in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> for a Sum of Mony? He cannot but have heard of the <hi>Tax</hi> of the <hi>Apostolick Chamber for several Sins,</hi> and what Sums are there set upon them. Why did he not as freely speak against this? This is published in the vast <hi>Collection</hi> of <hi>Tracts</hi> of <hi>Canon Law,</hi>

               <hi>that this Book was so far from being called in, that,</hi> he saith, <hi>the Popes Legats renerred those Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and confirmed them,</hi> It seems then a Sum of Mony may be of some consequence towards the obtaining Pardon for a Sin past, tho' not for a Licence to commit it. But what mighty diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is there, whether a Man procures with Mony a <hi>Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or a <hi>Pardon?</hi> For the Sin can hurt him no more, than if he had Licence to commit it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He doth believe there is a Power in the Church to grant Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences; which,</hi> he saith, <hi>concern not at all the Remission of Sins, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mortal or venial, but only of some temporal Punishments remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing due after the Guilt is remitted.</hi> Here now arises a material Question, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the <hi>Popes</hi> or the <hi>Representer</hi> be rather to be believed.

               <p>HE believes it damnable, to think injuriously of Christs Passion.

So that trusting in Christ as his Redeemer, he yet does not think that by Christ's Sufferings, every Christian is discharg'd of his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Sufferings; but that every one is to suffer something for himself, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> did, who by <hi>tribulations,</hi> and in <hi>suffering</hi> in his <hi>own flesh,</hi> did <hi>accomplish those things, that wanted of the Passions of Christ</hi>; and this not only for <hi>himself,</hi> but for the <hi>whole Church, Col.</hi> 1.24. and this he finds every where in <hi>Scripture, viz.</hi> People admonish'd of the greatness of their sins, doing Penance in <hi>Fasting, Sack-cloth and Ashes,</hi> and by <hi>voluntary</hi> austerities, endeavouring to satisfie the Divine Justice.

            </p>
            <p>But for right apprehending the State of the Controversy, we must consider;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they grant both Eternal and Temporal Pain due to Sin, to be remitted in Baptism; so that all the satisfaction to be made, is for Sins committed after Baptism.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We distinguish between Satisfaction to the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Absolution, and Satisfaction to the Justice of God for some part of the punishment to sin which is unremitted.</p>

            <p>The Matter in Controversy therefore on this Head, consists in these things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That after the total Remission of Sins in Baptism, they suppose a Temporal Punishment to remain, when the Eternal is forgiven; which the Penitent is to satisfy God's Justice for; and without this being done in this Life, he must go into Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory for that End. Of which more under that Head.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That this Satisfaction may be made to the Justice of God, after Absolution is given by the Priest. So that although the Penitent be admitted into God's Favour, by the Power of the Keys, according to their own Doctrine; yet the Application of the Merits of Christ, together with the Saints in the Sentence of Absolution (according to their Form) do not set him so free, but he either wants a new Supply from the Treasure of the Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> from the same Merits of Christ and the Saints; or
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60203:36"/>
else he is to satisfy for the Temporal Punishment by his own Penances.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That these Penitential Works are to be joyned with the Merits of Christ, in the way of proper Satisfaction to Divine Justice. And however softly this may be expressed, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that Christ hath merited, that we may merit, and by his Satisfaction, we are enabled to satisfy for our selves. And if the Satisfaction by way of Justice be taken away, the other will be a Controversy about Words.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That these Penitential Works may not only be sufficient for themselves,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Catech. Rom. de panit.

And about these Points, we must desire greater Proof than we have ever yet seen.</p>

For certainly, those who derive its Authority from the Church; who set Traditions in

equal esteem with it; who complain so much of its Obscurity, can never be said to hold in equal Veneration with those who maintain its independent Authority, its Sufficiency and Perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity. And these are known and material Points in Controversy between us and them: therefore let them not say, they hold it in the highest Veneration of all men living; tho those thought themselves thorough Catholicks, who have compared it to a <hi>Nose of Wax, to a</hi> Lesbian <hi>Rule, to a dead Letter, unsensed Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,</hi> and to other things, not fit to be repeated. But we are well pleased to find them express such Veneration for it. Wherefore then are the people to be kept from reading it?</p>
            <p n="2">2. He saith, <hi>It is not out of disrespect to it.</hi> But why then? (1.) <hi>Because private Interpretation is not proper for the Scripture,</hi> (2 Pet. 1.20.) One would think the Scripture were not kept <hi>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly</hi> from the people, by such a Sense being put upon it; for any one that would but consider that place, will find it must relate to the Prophets themselves; and doth he think the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were to be debarred from reading the Scriptures? But this is playing with Scripture, and not reasoning from it (2) <hi>Because in the Epistles of S.</hi> Paul <hi>are certain things hard to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now in my Opinion, such men deserve more to be debarred from med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the Scripture, who make such perverse Inferences from it, than ordinary Readers. And if they use all other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as they do this, they cannot be excused from <hi>depraving</hi> it. It is granted, there were then <hi>unlearned and unstable men,</hi> who misunderstood, or misapplied the Writings of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and other Scriptures. And what then? There are men of all Ages, who abuse the best things in the World, even the Gospel it self, and the Grace of God. Doth it hence follow, that the Gospel must not be preached to them, or the grace of God made known to them, for fear of mens making ill use of it? If this had been the just consequence, would not St. <hi>Peter</hi> himself have thought of this? But he was so far from making it, that he adviseth those persons he writes to, to have a mighty regard to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, even to the Prophetical Writings, <hi>as to a Light shi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

How could that be <hi>more sure</hi> to them, unless they were allowed to read, consider, and make use of it? (3.) <hi>Because God hath given only some to be Apostles, some Prophets, other some Evangelists, and other some Pastors and Doctors,</hi> Ephes. 4.11. Doth it hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that the People are not to read the Scriptures? In the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities, Tutors are appointed to interpret <hi>Aristotle</hi> to their Pupils; doth it hence follow that they are not to read <hi>Aristotle</hi> themselves? It is, no doubt, a mighty Advantage to have such infallible Interpreters as the <hi>Apostles and Prophets</hi>; and all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are bound to follow their Sense, where they have deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. But suppose the Question be about the Sense of these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters; must their Books not be looked into, because of the danger of Error? This Reason will still hold against those who go about to deliver their Sense; and so on, till by this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Reasoning, all sort of Books and Interpretations be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; unless any such can be found out, which is not liable to be abused or misunderstood. And if there be any such to be had, they are much to blame who do not discover it. But as yet we see no Remedy for two things in Mankind, a proneness to Sin, and to Mistake. But of all things, we ought not to take away from them one of the best Means to prevent both, <hi>viz.</hi> a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and careful, and humble reading the Holy Scriptures.</p>

            </p>
            <p>These are plausible pretences to such as search no farther; but the Mystery of this matter lies much deeper. It was, no doubt, the Design of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to keep the Bible wholly out of the hands of the people. But upon the Reformation they found it impossible; so many Translations being made into vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Languages; and therefore care was taken to have Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made by some of their own Body; and since the people of better inclinations to Piety were not to be satisfied without the Bible; therefore they thought it the better way to permit cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain persons whom they could trust, to have a License to read it: And this was the true Reason of the fourth Rule of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex Liber. prohibit.</hi> made in pursuance of the Order of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent,</hi> and published by <hi>Pius</hi> IV. by which any one may
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60203:38"/>
see it was not an Original Permission out of any good Will to the Thing; but an Aftergame to get the Bible out of the hands of the People again: And therefore Absolution was to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to those who would not deliver them to their Ordinaries when they were called for: And the Regulars themselves were not to be permitted to have Bibles without a License: And as far as I can understand the Addition of <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. to that fourth Rule, he withdraws any new Power of granting such Licenses; and saith they are contrary to the <hi>Command and V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of that Church,</hi>

who declares his mind plainly in this case, saying, <hi>That he would not believe the Gospel, except the Authority of the Catholick Church mov'd him threunto. (Contra Ep. Fundam.</hi> c. 4.) Now he is well satisfied, that many doubted whether these Books were <hi>Canonical</hi> or no; and amongst others, S. <hi>Ierom</hi>; because the Church had not declar'd them so: But since the <hi>Church</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, no Catholick ever doubted; no more than of other Books, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Epistle to the</hi> Hebrews, the <hi>Epistle of St.</hi> James, the <hi>second of St.</hi> Peter, the <hi>second and third of St.</hi> John, <hi>St.</hi> Jude<hi>'s Epistle, and the</hi> Apocalyps: All which were for many years after the Apostles time doubted of; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards declar'd and receiv'd as <hi>Canonical.</hi> This he finds S. <hi>Ierome</hi> expresly confessing of himself, <hi>viz.

               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:60203:39"/>4. <hi>It is of little concern to him, whether these Books were ever in the Hebrew Copy.</hi> I would only ask whether it be of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to him, whether they were divinely inspired or not? He saith, <hi>It is damnable to add to the Scripture</hi>; by the Scripture we mean Books written by Divine Inspiration: Can the Church make Books to be so written, which were not so written? If not, then all it hath to do, is to deliver by Tradition what was so, and what not.

            <p n="5">5. <hi>Since the Churches Declaration,</hi> he saith, <hi>no Catholicks ever doubted.</hi> What doth he mean by the Churches Declaration, that of <hi>Innocent,</hi> and the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi>? Then the same Bishop hath shewed him, that since that time, there have been very many, both in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Church, of another O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. And a little before the Council of <hi>Trent, Catharinus</hi> saith,<note place="margin">

               <hi>That a Friend of his, and a Brother in Christ, derided him as one that wanted Learning, for daring to assert these Books were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Canon of Scripture</hi>; and it is plain, <hi>Card.

            <p>THE only thing insisted on here is, <hi>That it is not the Words, but the Sense of Scripture is the Rule; and that this Sense is not to be taken from Mens private Fancies, which are various and uncertain; and therefore where there is no security from Errors, there is nothing capable of being a Rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To clear this, we must consider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is not necessary to the making of a Rule, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any possibility of mistake, but that it be such that they cannot mistake without their own fault. For Certainty in it self, and Sufficiency for the use of others, are all the necessary Properties of a Rule; but after all, it's possible for Men not to apply the Rule aright, and then they are to be blamed, and not the Rule.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If no Men can be certain of the right Sense of Scripture, then it is not plain in necessary things; which is contrary to the design of it, and to the clearest Testimonies of Antiquity, and to the common Sense of all Christians, who never doubted or disputed the Sense of some things revealed therein; as the Unity of the Godhead, the making of the World by him, the Deluge, the History of the Patriarchs, the Captivity of the Jews, the coming of the Messias, his sending his Apostles, his coming again to Judgment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No Man who reads such things in Scripture, can have any doubt about the Sense and Meaning of the Words.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:60203:42"/>3. Where the Sense is dubious, we do not allow any Man to put what Sense he pleases upon them; but we say, there are certain means, whereby he may either attain to the true Sense, or not be damned if he do not. And the first thing every man is to regard, is not his security from being deceived, but from being damned. For Truth is made known in order to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: If therefore I am sure to attain the chief end, I am not so much concerned, as to the possibility of Errors, as that I be not deceived by my own fault. We do not therefore leave Men <hi>either to follow their own fancy, or to interpret Scripture by it</hi>; but we say, They are bound upon pain of Damnation to seek the Truth sincerely, and to use the best means in order to it; and if they do this, they either will not err, or their Errors will not be their Crime.</p>

            <p n="1">1. THE Question is not, Whether Men are not bound to make use of the best means for the right Interpretation of Scripture, by Reading, Meditation, Prayer, Advice, a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and teachable Temper, <hi>&amp;c. i. e.</hi> all the proper means fit for such an end? but whether after all these, there be a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of submitting to some infallible Judge, in order to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the certain Sense of Scripture?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Question is not, Whether we ought not to have a mighty regard to the Sense of the whole Christian Church in all Ages since the Apostles, which we profess to have; but, Whether the <hi>present Roman Church,</hi> as it stands divided from other Communions, hath such a Right and Authority to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret Scripture, that we are bound to believe that to be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Sense of Scripture which she delivers?</p>
            <p>And here I cannot but take notice how strangely this matter is here misrepresented: for the Case is put,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>As if every one who rejects their pretence of Infallibility, had nothing to guide him but his own private Fancy in the Interpretation of Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>As if we rejected the Sense put upon Scripture by the whole Community of Christians in all ages since the Apostles times.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we appeal, in the matters in difference between us, to this universal Sense of the Christian Church, and are verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded they cannot make it out in any one Point wherein we differ from them. And themselves cannot deny, that in several we have plainly the Consent of the first Ages, as far as appears by the Books remaining, on our side; as in the Worship of Images, Invocation of Saints, Papal Supremacy, Communion
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60203:43"/>
in both kinds, Prayer and Scripture in known Tongues; and I may safely add, the Sufficiency of the Scripture, Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, Auricular Confession, Publick Communions, Solitary Masses, to name no more.</p>
            <p>But here lies the Artifice; We must not pretend to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of judging either of Scripture, or Tradition; but we must trust their Judgment what is the Sense of Scripture, and what hath been the Practice of the Church in all Ages, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their own Writers confess the contrary: which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard.</p>
            <p>But he seems to argue for such a Submission to the Church;</p>
            <p n="1">1.<hi>Because we receive the Book of Scripture from her; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from her we are to receive the Sense of the Book.</hi> An admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Argument! We receive the <hi>Old Testament</hi> from the <hi>Iews</hi>; therefore from them we are to receive the Sense of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> and so we are to reject the true <hi>Messias.</hi> But this is not all: If by the Church, they mean the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in distinction from others, we deny it: if they mean the whole Christian Church, we grant it: but then the force of it is quite lost. But why is it not possible for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to keep these Writings, and deliver them to others, which make against her self? Do not Persons in Law-Suits often produce Deeds which make against them? But there is yet a further Reason; it was not possible for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to make away these <hi>Writings,</hi> being so universally spread.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Because the Church puts the difference between true and false Books, therefore that must be trusted for the true Sense of them.</hi> Which is just as one should argue, The Clerks of the Rolls are to give an account to the Court of true Records, therefore they are to sit on the Bench, and to give Judgment in all Causes. The Church is only to declare what it finds as to Canonical Books; but hath no Power to make any Book Canonical, which was not before received for such.

            <p n="1">1. WE are glad to find so good a Resolution as seems to be expressed in these words, <hi>viz. That he is obliged to believe nothing besides that which Christ taught, and his Apostles; and if any thing contrary to this should be defined, and commanded to be believe, even by Ten Thousand Councils, he believes it dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in any one to receive it, and by such Decrees to make Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to his Creed.</hi> This seems to be a very good saying, and it is pity any thing else should overthrow it. But here lies the Misrepresenting; he will believe what Christ and his Apostles taught, from the Definitions of Councils; and so all this goodly Fabrick falls to nothing; for it is but as if one should say, If <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> should falsly deliver <hi>Plato</hi>'s sense, I will never believe him, but I am resolved to take <hi>Plato</hi>'s sense only from <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Words. So here, he first declares he will take the Faith of Christ from the Church; and then he saith, if the Church Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative should contradict the Faith of Christ, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver believe it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We dispute not with them, the Right and Necessity of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils,</hi> (upon great occasions) if they be truly so, rightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called, lawfully assembled, and fairly managed; which have been, and may be of great use to the Christian world, for setling the Faith, healing the Breaches of Christendom, and reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Abuses. And we farther say, that the Decrees of such Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils ought to be submitted to, where they proceed upon certain Grounds of Faith, and not upon unwritten Traditions; which was the fatal stumbling at the threshold in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and was not to be recovered afterwards; for their setting up Traditions equally with the written Word, made it it easie
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60203:46"/>
for them to define, and as easie for all others to reject their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions, in case there had not been so many other Objections against the Proceedings of that Council. And so all our Dispute concerning this matter is taken off from the general Notion, and runs into the particular Debate concerning the Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Proceedings of some which were called Free, General Councils; but were neither <hi>General,</hi> nor <hi>Free</hi>; and therefore <hi>could not deliver the Sense of the Catholick Church,</hi> which our Author requires them to do.</p>

The like assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> he believes to be in all <hi>General Councils,</hi> which is the Church-<hi>Representative:</hi> (as the <hi>Parliament</hi> is the <hi>Representative</hi> of the Nation,) by which they are especially protected from all <hi>Errour,</hi> in all Definitions and Declarations in matters of <hi>Faith.</hi> So that what the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi> pronounc'd concerning the Result of their Council; <hi>(Acts</hi> 15.28.) <hi>It hath seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to Vs</hi>; He does not doubt, may be prefix'd to all the <hi>Determinations</hi> in Point of <hi>Faith,</hi> resolv'd on, by any <hi>General Council lawfully</hi> assembled since that time, or to be held to the Worlds end.

Neither does it reflect at all on the Churches <hi>Authority,</hi> or make the Truth of her Doctrine questionable to him; that many of her eminent Members, Doctors, Prelates, and leading Men, have been, or are great enormous Sinners, infamous for their <hi>Pride, Covetousness,</hi> or other <hi>Vices,</hi> whatsoever: The <hi>Promises</hi> of God's <hi>continual and un-interrupted Assistance</hi> to his Church, being not to be frustrated by the Wickedness of such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Men, though in great Dignities.

Nay, though all things touching Religion and Virtue, were in a manner run to decay, in our Saviour's time, both in Priests and People; yet did he maintain the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church; and commanded all to be Obedient, and submit to those who had the Superiority; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out calling in question their Authority, or doubting of the Reasonableness of their Commands. <hi>The Scribes and Pharisees,</hi> (says he, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.2.) <hi>sit in</hi> Moses<hi>'s Chair: All therefore, whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe, and do: But do ye not after their Works.</hi> If therefore God's <hi>special Assistance</hi> was never wanting to the Church of the <hi>Iews,</hi> so as to let it fail in the <hi>Truth</hi> of its <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or its <hi>Authority</hi>; notwithstanding the Pride, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness, Cruelty, Impiety, Idolatry, of many of her <hi>Levites, Elders, Priests</hi> and <hi>High-Priests.</hi> Why should not he believe the same of the Church of Christ, which, (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> says) <hi>is built on better Promises</hi>; and that it remains entire in the <hi>Truth</hi> of her <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and her <hi>Authority,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Viciousness of many of her <hi>Governours.</hi> Especially, since he's in a manner confident, that there has been nothing so infamous acted by any <hi>Priests, Prelates, Popes</hi> or others, since Christ's time, but what may be follow'd; Nay, was out-done by the <hi>Priests</hi> of the <hi>Iews.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. HE doth not pretend this belongs <hi>to the Pastors and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of his Church, who may fall,</hi> he saith, <hi>into Heresie and Schism; but that the whole Church is secured by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Promises from all Error and danger of Prevarication</hi>; which he proves from <hi>the Promises of the New Testament, Mat.</hi> 16.18—28.20. <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.16, 26. But however the former seems to take away Infallibility from the Guides of the Church, yet that this is to be understood of them <hi>seperately,</hi> appears by what follows.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The like Assistance of the Holy Ghost he believes to be in all Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils, which is the Church Representative; by which they are specially protected from all error in all definitions and declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in matters of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now here are two sorts of Infallibility tacked to one another by vertue of these general Promises, which ought more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly to be considered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To preserve Christs Church so as it shall never cease to be a Church, is one thing; to preserve it from all Errors is another: The former answers the End of Christs Promises as to the <hi>Duration</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>; and the latter is not implied in them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The promise of <hi>teaching them all Truth,</hi> Joh. 16.13. is not made to the whole Church, but to the <hi>Apostles:</hi> And their case was so peculiar and extraordinary, that there can be no just in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from the assistance promised to them, of what the Church should enjoy in all Ages.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If the diffusive Church have no infallible Assistance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, then no infallible Assistance can from thence be proved for the Church Representative; so that some particular Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to the Guides of the Church as assembled together, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to prove the Infallibility of Councils.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It by no means proves following Councils to be Infallible, because the Apostle said, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.28. <hi>It seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us.</hi> Our Author <hi>doth not doubt, but the same may be prefixed to all determinations in point of Faith, resolved on by any General Council lawfully assembled since that time, or to be held to the Worlds end.</hi> But what Reason he had for not doubting in this matter, I cannot see; the <hi>Assistance,</hi> he said, <hi>being to extend
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60203:48"/>
as far as the Promise:</hi> But shall <hi>Assistance</hi> imply <hi>Infallibility</hi>? Then there must be good store, as long as the Promises of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace hold good: But this Assistance of Councils is very different from the Assistance of Grace, for the Church may sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist without Councils, but cannot without Grace: What Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council was there from the meeting, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice</hi>? Were not Christ's Promises fulfilled to his Church all that time, when it encreased in all parts against the most violent Opposition?</p>
            <p n="5">5. No parity of Reason from the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church can be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proof for Infallibility in the Christian. But our Author argues thus, <hi>If Gods special Assistance was never wanting to the Church of the Iews so as to let it fail in the truth of its Doctrine, or its Authority; Why should not he believe the same of the Church of Christ, which is built on better Promises</hi>? What special Assistance was it which <hi>Israel</hi> had, when it is said, that <hi>for a long time Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael had been without the true God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chr. 15.3.</note> 
               <hi>and without a teaching Priest, and without Law?</hi> And as to <hi>Iudah,</hi> was there no failing in point of Doctrine in our Saviours time? It is true they had the Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and that was all that was good among them; for their Teachers had corrupted themselves and the people, and made the Law of no effect among them: If there were Infallibility a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where it must be in the High Priest and <hi>Sanhedrim</hi>; but is it possible for any Christian to think them Infallible, when they were so grosly mistaken about the main Article of their Faith as to the Messias, and pronounced him worthy of Death? Is not this a fine Argument for the Infallibility of the Guides of the Christian Church? <hi>But the Church of Christ hath better Promises:</hi> No doubt of it, greater Promises of Grace and Mercy in this World, and in that to come: but what is all this to Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in Councils?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Christ's Command of Obedience to those who sat in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> Chair, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 23.2.) doth not prove the Infallibility of those who sat there. Yet this is alledged to that purpose; and that men ought not to doubt of the Reasonableness of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of their Superiors. But St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> saith,<note place="margin">

This therefore looks too much like assuming the Place of Christ, and not becoming the Distance between God and Man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Question is, <hi>Whether Christ hath appointed the Pope or Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>to be Pastor, Governour, and Head of his Church under him? This,</hi> he saith, <hi>he believes,</hi> and this he knows we deny, and therefore had reason to expect some proof of it, But instead thereof he tells us <hi>how they look on themselves as obliged to shew him the Respect due to his place,</hi> which he knows is not the matter in question. Two things however he saith, which seem to justifie his Title.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He is the Successor of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>to whom Christ committed the Care of his Flock.</hi> But how far is this from proving the Pope to be Head of the Church under Christ?

But we need not insist on the proof of this, since the late mentioned Authors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion have taken so great pains, not only to prove the Popes Supremacy to be an Incroachment &amp; Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation in the Church, but that the laying it aside is necessary to the Peace and Unity of it. And until the Divine Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Papal Supremacy be proved, it is to no purpose to debate <hi>what manner of Assistance is promised to the Pope in his Decrees.</hi> Our Author is willing to decline the Debate about his <hi>personal Infallibility, as a matter of Opinion, and not of Faith</hi>; and yet he saith, <hi>he doubts not but God doth grant a special Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to the High Priest, for the good of the whole Flock, under the New Law, as he did under the Old, and produces the Instance of</hi> Caiaphas, Joh. 11.51. This is a very surprizing way of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning; for if his Arguments be good from Scripture, he must hold the Popes <hi>personal Infallibility</hi> as <hi>a matter of Faith</hi>; and yet one would hardly think he should build an Article of Faith on the instance of <hi>Caiaphas:</hi> For what consequence can be drawn from Gods over-ruling the Mind of a very bad man, when he was carrying on a most wicked design, to utter such words, which in the event proved true in another sense than he meant them, that therefore God will give a special Assistance to the Pope in determining matters of Faith? Was not <hi>Caia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi> himself the man who proposed the taking away the Life of Christ at that time? Was he assisted in that Council? Did not he determine afterwards Christ to be guilty of Blasphemy, and therefore worthy of Death? And is not this a rare Infallibility which is supposed to be consistent with a Decree to crucifie Christ? And doth he in earnest think such, Orders are to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, whether the Supreme Pastor be Infallible or not? For so he concludes, <hi>That his Sentence is to be obeyed, whether he be Infallible or no?</hi>

And is it not another great Mystery, that these <hi>Dispensations</hi> for Lying and Swearing should be according to the <hi>Receiv'd Doctrine</hi> of his <hi>Church</hi>; and yet that he, or any of his Communion, were never instructed nor inform'd of any such Diabolical Point? nay, had never come to the knowledge of it, had it not been for the information receiv'd from some Zealous Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, such as relate either meerly <hi>upon Trust,</hi> or else such as have receiv'd a <hi>Dispensation</hi> of Lying from the Devil, that they might charge the like Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine on the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Pope.</hi>

            <head>XIX. Of Dispensations.</head>
            <p>HEre the <hi>Misrepresenter</hi> saith, That a Papist believes that the Pope hath Authority to dispence with the Laws of God, and absolve any one from the Obligation of keeping the Commandments. On the other side, the <hi>Representer</hi> affirms; <hi>That the Pope has no Authority to dispence with the Law of God, and that there's no Power upon Earth can absolve any one from the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of keeping the Commandments:</hi> This matter is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the one's affirming, and the others denying; but by finding out, if possible, the true sense of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> about this matter. And there are three Opinions about it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of those who assert, <hi>That the Pope hath a Power of Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in any Divine Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Concess. Praebend è proposuit. Abb. c. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posuit de Conc. Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend. <hi>C.</hi> 5. <hi>Q.</hi> 6. c. Aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate.</note> 
               <hi>except the Articles of Faith.</hi> The Gloss upon the Canon Law saith, that where the Text seems to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that the Pope cannot dispence against the Apostle, it is to be understood of Articles of Faith: And <hi>Panormitan</hi> saith, This Exposition pleases him well; for the Pope may dispense in all other things: <hi>Contra Apostolum dispensat,</hi> saith the Gloss on the Decree: And the <hi>Roman</hi> Editors in the Margin, refer to 34 <hi>Dist. c. Lector</hi> to prove it: And there indeed the Gloss is very plain in the Case, <hi>sic Ergo Papa dispensat contra Apostolum:</hi> And the <hi>Roman</hi> Correcters there justifie it, and say it is no absurd Doctrine as to positive Institutions:<note place="margin">Sum. Angelic. v. dispensatio.</note> But the former <hi>notable Gloss,</hi> as <hi>Panormitan</hi> calls it, sets down the particulars wherein the Pope may dispense. As, 1. Against the Apostles and their Canons. 2. Against the Old Testament. 3. In Vows. 4. In Oaths. The <hi>Summa Angelica</hi> saith, the Pope may dispense as to all the Precepts of the Old Testament. And <hi>Clavasius</hi> founds this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er upon the Plenitude of the Popes Power, according to that Expression in the Decretal mentioned, that he can, <hi>ex plenitudine potestatis de Iure supra Ius dispensare</hi>; and without such a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he saith, God would not have taken that care of his Church, which was to be expected from his Wisdom. <hi>Iacobatius</hi> brings several Instances of this Power in the Pope,<note place="margin">Jacobat. de Conciliis l. 5. p. 215.</note> and refers to the <hi>Speculator</hi> for more. <hi>Iac.

            <p n="2">2. Some of their Divines held <hi>that the Pope could not dispence

with the Law of God,</hi> as that implies a proper <hi>relaxation</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> but could only <hi>Authoritatively declare</hi> that the Law did not oblige in such a particular Case; because an Inferiour could not take away the force of a Superiors Law; and otherwise there would be no fixed and immutable Rule in the Church; and if the Pope might dispense in one Law of God, he might dispense in the rest. And of this Opinion were some of the most eminent School-Divines, as <hi>Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventure, Major, Soto,</hi> and <hi>Catharinus,</hi>

                  </gap>. Cajetan. 6. p. 524.</note> who at large debates this Question, and denies that the Pope hath any Power to dispense with Gods Law: But then he adds, that the Pope hath a kind of <hi>propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Power</hi> to <hi>declare</hi> in what Cases the Law doth oblige, and in what not; which he parallels with the Power of <hi>declaring</hi> the <hi>Canon of Scripture</hi>; and this he doth not by his own Authority, but by Gods; He confesseth the Pope cannot dispense with those Precepts which are of themselves indispensable; nor alter the Sacraments; but then, saith he, there are some Divine Laws, which have a general force, but in particular Cases may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensed with; and in these cases the Law is to be relaxed, so that the Relaxation seems to come from God himself: But he confesses this Power is not to be often made use of; so that he makes this Power to be no Act of Jurisdiction, but of <hi>propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Interpretation,</hi> as he calls it; and he brings the Instance of <hi>Caiaphas</hi> to this purpose: And he adds, that the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Divines and <hi>Canonists</hi> was but in Terms; for the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonists</hi> were in the right as to the Power, and the Divines in the manner of explaining it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Others have thought this too loose a way of explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Popes Power, and therefore they say, <hi>That the Pope hath not a bare declaratory Power, but a real Power of dispensing in a proper sense in particular Cases:</hi> For, say they, the other is no act of Jurisdiction, but of Discretion, and may belong to other men as well as to the Pope; but this they look on as more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Popes Authority and Commission; and a bare declaratory Power would not be sufficient for the Churches Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity; as <hi>Sanchez</hi> shews at large, and quotes many Authors for this Opinion;<note place="margin">Sanchez. d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60203:53"/>
it upon Christ's Promise to <hi>Peter, To thee will I give the Keys,</hi> and the Charge to him, <hi>Feed my Sheep.</hi> But then he explains this Opinion, by saying that it is no formal Dispensation with the Law of God, but the matter of the Law is changed or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away.</p>
            <p>Thus I have briefly laid together the different Opinions in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> about this power of dispensing with the Law of God, from which it appears, that they do all consent in the thing, but differ only in the manner of explaining it.</p>
            <p>And I am therefore afraid our <hi>Representer</hi> is a very unstudied Divine, and doth not well understand their own Doctrine, or he would never have talked so boldly and unskilfully in this matter.</p>
            <p>As to what he pretends, that <hi>their Church teaches that every Lye is a Sin,</hi> &amp;c. it doth not teach the Case; for the Question it not, whether their Church teach men to lye, but whether there be not such a power in the Church, as by altering the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, may not make that not to be a Lye, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise would be one: As their Church teaches that men ought not to break their V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ws; yet no one among them questions, but the Pope may dissolve the Obligation of a Vow, although it be made to God himself. Let him shew then, how the Pope comes to have a Power to release a Vow made to God, and not to have a Power to release the Obligation to veracity among men.</p>
            <p>Again, We do not charge them with delivering any such Doctrine, <hi>That men may have Dispensations to lye and forswear themselves at pleasure</hi>; for we know this Dispensing Power is to be kept up as a great Mystery, and not to be made use of, but upon weighty and urgent causes, of great consequence and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>it to the Church, as their Doctors declare. But as to all matters of fact, which he alludes to, I have nothing to say to them; for our Debate is only, whether there be such a Power of Dispensation allowed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or not?</p>

            <p>Whether those who deny it, do account it an Article of Faith; for we know they do not: But whether upon the Principles of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> they are not bound to do it.</p>
            <p>I shall only, to avoid cavilling, proceed upon the Principles owned by our Author himself. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the sense of Scripture, as understood by the Community of Christians in all Angels since the Apostles, is to be taken from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Church.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>If therefore it appear that Popes and Councils have declared this Deposing Doctrine, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ve received other things as Articles of Faith upon the same Declarations, why should they then stick at yielding this to be an Article of Faith, as well as the other.</p>
            <p>It is not denied, that I can find, that Popes and Councils for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60203:55"/>
Ages have asserted and exercised the Deposing Power; but it is alledged against these Decrees &amp; Acts. 1. That they were not grounded upon Universal Tradition. 2. That they had not Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Reception.</p>
            <p>Now, if these be sufficient to overthrow the Definitions of Councils, let us consider the consequences of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then every Man is left to examin the Decrees of Councils, whether they are to be embraced or not; for he is to judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are founded on Universal Tradition; and so he is not to take the sense of the present Church for his Guide, but the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Church from Christs time: which overthrows a Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Principle of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

Church, which the Deposing Doctrine hath had in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>? To make the Case parallel, he must suppose our Houses of Convocation to have several times declared these Damnable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and given Encouragement to Rebels to proceed against their Kings; and the University of <hi>Oxford</hi> to have condemned them; for this is truly the Case in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; the Popes and Councils have owned, and approved, and acted by the Depos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Principle: but the Universities of <hi>France,</hi> of late years, have condemned it. How come the Principles of the Regicides among us to be parallel'd with this Doctrine, when the Principles of our Church are so directly contrary to them; and our Houses of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation would as readily condemn any such damnable Doctrines, as the University of <hi>Oxford</hi>?

            <head>XXI. Of Communion in one kind.</head>
            <p>FOR our better proceeding in this Controversie, I shall set down the State of it as clearly as I can.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Question is not, Whether the first Institution of the Sacrament of the Eucharist by Jesus Christ, were in one kind, or two; for all confess it was under both kinds.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is not. Whether both kinds are not still necessary for the due Celebration of it; for it is granted that both kinds are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be upon the Altar, or else there could be no compleat Sacrifice.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is not, Whether the People may be wholly excluded from both kinds, and so the Sacrifice only remain: for they grant that the People are bound to communicate in one kind.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is not concerning any peculiar and extraordinary Cases, where no Wine is to be had, or there be a particular Aversion to it, or any such thing, where positive Institutions may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably presumed to have no force: But concerning the publick and solemn Celebration, and participation of it in the Christian Church.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is not concerning the meer disuse or neglect of it, But concerning the lawfulness of Excluding the People from both Kinds, by the Churches Prohibition, notwithstanding the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of it by Christ in both kinds, with a Command to keep up the Celebration of it to his Second Coming.</p>
            <p>Here now consists the point in Controversie, Whether the Church being obliged to keep up the Institution in both kinds, be not equally obliged to distribute both as our Saviour did, to as many as partake of it? Our Author not denying the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the continuance of it, saith, <hi>Our Saviour left it indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to receive it in one kind, or both.</hi> And that is the point to be examined.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He saith, <hi>Christ delivered it to his Apostles, who only were then present, and whom he made Priests just before: yet he gave
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60203:58"/>
no command that it should be so received by all the Faithful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But were not the Apostles all the Faithful then present? I pray in what capacity did they then receive it? As Priests? How did they receive the Bread before the <hi>hoc facite?</hi> As Priests or as faithful? It is ridiculous to suppose the <hi>hoc facite</hi> changed their capacity; and if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t did, it only relates to consecrating, and not to receiving: but if Christ gave it only to the Apostles as Priests, then for all that I can see, the People are not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in one kind or other; but it was intended only for Priests: If the people be concerned, how came they to be so? Where is there any command but what refers to the first Institution? And it had been more plausible, according to this Answer, to exclude the People wholly, than to admit them to one kind, and to debar them the other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Christ attributes the obtaining Life Everlasting, the end of the Institution, sometimes to receiving under both kinds, sometimes under one,</hi> John 6.51, 57, 58. He could not easily have thought of any thing more against himself; for our Saviour there makes it as necessary to drink his Blood, as to eat his Flesh, <hi>Verily, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. John 6.51.</note> 
               <hi>I say unto you, Except ye eat the Flesh of the Son of man, and drink his Blood, ye have no Life in you:</hi> If this be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the Sacrament, as he saith, How is it possible for him to make the Cup indifferent? Unless it be indifferent whether the People be saved or not.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Christ himself administred the Sacrament to some of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples under one kind only,</hi> Luke 24.30. But is he sure Christ did then administer the Sacrament to them? Or that if he did, the Cup was not implied, since breaking of Bread, when taken for an ordinary Meal in Scripture, doth not exclude drinking at it? <hi>But S.</hi> Augustin, he saith, (l. 49. <hi>de Consensu Evangel.) under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands that place of the Sacrament.</hi> If he doth, it cannot be where he saith; for S. <hi>Augustin</hi> wrote but Four Books of that Subject: but l. 3.25. he doth say something towards it; yet S. <hi>Augustin</hi> in another place supposes that these Disciples did both eat and drink. <hi>The Disciples did not know him, but in the breaking of Bread</hi>;<note place="margin">Tract. 2. in Epist.

As in the case of the <hi>Israelites.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>quity, and then undertakes to explain the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ctrine of <hi>Purgatory</hi> from substantial Reasons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to his Proof from Scripture.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Is that from 2 <hi>Maccab.</hi> c. 12. where he saith, <hi>Money was sent to</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>that Sacrifices might be offered for the slain; and 'tis recommended as a Holy Cogitation, to pray for the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this, which is the main foundation of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> I answer, 1. It can never prove such a <hi>Purgatory</hi> as our Author asserts; for he supposes <hi>a Sinner reconciled to God, as to eternal Punishment,</hi> before he be capable of <hi>Purgatory</hi>; but here can be no such Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, for these Men died in the sin of <hi>Achan,</hi> which was not known till their Bodies were found among the slain. Here was no Confession, or any sign of Repentance; and therefore if it proves any thing, it is <hi>deliverance from Eternal Punishment,</hi> and for such as dye in their Sins without any shew of Repentance. 2. We must distinguish the Fact of <hi>Iudas</hi> from the Interpretation of <hi>Iason,</hi> or his Epitomizer. The Fact of <hi>Iudas</hi> was according to the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Law, which required in such Cases <hi>a Sin-Offering</hi>; and that is all which the <hi>Greek</hi> implies. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And so <hi>Leo Allatius</hi> confesses all the best <hi>Greek</hi> Copies agree;<note place="margin">Leo Allat. de Purgat. p. 889</note> and he reckons Twelve of them. Now what doth this imply, but that <hi>Iudas</hi> remembring the severe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of this Sin in the Case of <hi>Achan,</hi> upon the People, sent a Sin-Offering to <hi>Ierusalem</hi>? But saith <hi>Leo Allatius, It was the sin of those men that were slain.</hi> I grant it. But the Question is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>the Sin-Offering</hi> respected the dead or the living? For the Law in such a Case required <hi>a Sin-Offering for the Congregation.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Levit. 4.13.</note> And why should not we believe so punctual a Man for the Law, as <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> did strictly observe it in this point? <hi>But the Author of the Book of</hi> Maccabees <hi>understands it of those that were slain.</hi> I do not deny it; but then, 3. We have no Reason to rely upon his Authority in this matter; which I shall make appear by a parallel Instance. He doth undoubtedly commend the fact of <hi>Razias</hi> in <hi>Killing himself</hi> (2. Macc. 14.42.) when he saith he did it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>like a brave Man</hi>; and if he had thought it a fault in him, he would never
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60203:62"/>
have given such a Character of it, but he would have added some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Caution after it. And it is no great advantage to <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> for him that commends Self-murder to have introduced it. The most probable account I can give of it is, That the <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian Iews,</hi> of whose number <hi>Iason</hi> of <hi>Cyrene</hi> seems to have been, had taken in several of the Philosophical Opinions, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Platonists,</hi> into their Religion, as appears by <hi>Philo</hi>; and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself confesses,<note place="margin">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat. l 1. c. 8.</note> that <hi>Plato</hi> held a <hi>Purgatory</hi>: and they were ready to apply what related to the Law, to their Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Notions. So here the Law appointed a Sin-offering with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the Living; but <hi>Iason</hi> would needs have this refer to the dead; and then sets down his own remark upon it, That <hi>it was a holy Cogitation to pray for the dead</hi>; as our Author renders it. If it were <hi>holy</hi> with respect to the Law, there must be some ground for it in the Law. And that we appeal to; and do not think any particular Fancies sufficient to introduce such a Novelty as this was, which had no Foundation either in the Law or the Prophets. And it would be strange for a new Doctrine to be set up, when the Spirit of Prophecy was ceased among them.</p>

Auctoritate laudasus est Razias,</hi> are their very Words in S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine.</hi> And therefore the Caution relates to the Books, and not meerly to his Example. And he lessens the Character given by the Author, when he saith, <hi>He chose to dye nobly; It had been better,</hi> saith he, <hi>to have died humbly. But the other is the Elogium given in the Heathen Histories, and better becomes brave Heathens than true Martyrs.</hi> Can any one now think S. <hi>Augustine</hi> believed this Writer Divinely inspired, or his Doctrine sufficient to ground a Point of Faith upon? And I wonder they should not every jot as well commend <hi>Self-murder</hi> as an <hi>Heroical Act.</hi> as prove the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Purgatory</hi> from these words of <hi>Iason,</hi> or his Epitemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer. For the Argument from the Authority of the Book, will hold as strongly for one as the other. And yet this is the <hi>Achilles</hi> for <hi>Purgatory</hi>; which <hi>Natalis Alexander</hi> (whom our Author follows in this matter) saith,<note place="margin">Natal. Alex. Sec. 4 Diss. 4.</note> 
               <hi>is a demonstrative place against those that deny it.</hi> But I must proceed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Purgatory is plainly intimated by our Saviour,</hi> Matt. 12.32. <hi>Whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this World, neither in the World to come. By which words, Christ evidently supposes, that some Sins are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the World to come.</hi> I am so far from discerning this plain Intimation, that I wonder how any came to think of it out of this place. Well! <hi>But doth it not hence follow, that Sins may be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the World to come?</hi> Not near so plainly, as that Sins will not be forgiven in the World to come. <hi>Not that particular Sin, but others may</hi>; How doth that appear? What intimation is there that any Sins not forgiven here, shall be forgiven there? Or that any Sins here remitted as to the Eternal Punishment, shall be there remitted as to the Temporal? And without such a kind of Remission, nothing can be inferred from hence. <hi>But if there be a Remission in another World, it can be neither in Heaven nor Hell, therefore it must be in Purgatory.</hi> But those who own a Remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sins in another World, say it will be on the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For the actual Deliverance of the Just from Punishment, may be not improperly called the full Remission of their Sins. So S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> whom he quotes, plainly saith, <hi>Si nulla remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terentur in judicio illo novissimo, &amp;c. Iulian,</hi> l. 6. c. 5. where it is evident S. <hi>Augustine</hi> takes this place to relate to the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and so in the other, (<hi>De Civit. Dei l.</hi> 21. <hi>c.</hi> 24.) But as he
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60203:63"/>
supposed a Remission, so he did a Purgation as <hi>by Fire</hi> in that day. <hi>In illo judicio poenas quasdam purgatorias futuras. De Civit. Dei l</hi> 20. <hi>c.</hi> 25. And so he is to be understood on <hi>Psal.</hi> 37. to which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15. But our Author was very much out, when he saith S. <hi>Augustine</hi> applied 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. to some place of temporal Chastisement in another World, when <hi>Bellarmine</hi> sets himself to confute S. <hi>Augustine</hi> about it,<note place="margin">Bell. de An. Christi l. 4. c. 13.</note> as understanding it of this World. And therefore he hath little cause to boast of St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority about <hi>Purgatory,</hi> unless he had brought something more to the Purpose out of him.

               </gap>s other Testimonies of Antiquity are not worth considering; which he borrows from <hi>Natalis Alexander</hi>: that of <hi>Dionysius Areopag. Eccl. Hierarch. c.</hi> 7. is a known Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, and impertinent, relating to a Region of Rest and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness. And so do <hi>Tertullian's Oblations for the Dead, De Cor. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit. c.</hi> 3. For they were Eucharistical, as appears by the ancient Liturgies, being made for the greatest Saints. St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> Ep. 66. speaks of <hi>an Oblation for the Dead:</hi> and he there mentions the <hi>Natalitia</hi> of the Martyrs: but by comparing that with his <hi>Epist.</hi> 33. it will be found that he speaks of the <hi>Anniversary Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of the Dead,</hi> which signifies nothing to Purgatory: for the best men were put into it: and St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> threatens it as a Punishment to be left out of the <hi>Diptychs</hi>; but surely it is none to escape Purgatory: <hi>Arnobius l.</hi> 4. only speaks of <hi>praying for the Dead,</hi> which we deny not to have been then used in the Church, not with respect to any temporary pains in <hi>purgatory,</hi> but to the Day of Judgment: And therein lies the true state of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, with respect to Antiquity: which is not, Whether any solemn Prayers were not then made for the dead; but whether those Prayers did relate to their deliverance out of a state of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment before the Day of Judgment. For whatever state Souls were then supposed to be in, before the great Day, if there could be no deliverance till the Day of Judgment, it signifies nothing to the present Question.</p>
            <p>As to the Vision of <hi>Perpetua</hi> concerning her Brother <hi>Dinocrates</hi> who died at Seven Years old, being baptized, it is hardly reconcila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their own Doctrine. to suppose such a Soul in Purgatory: I will not deny that <hi>Perpetua</hi> did think she saw him in a worse Condition: and thought likewise that by her Prayers she brought him into a better; for she saw him playing like little Children:
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60203:64"/>
and then she awaked, and concluded that she had given him ease: but is it indeed come to this, that such a Doctrine as Purgatory must be bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lt on such a Foundation as this? I do not call in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Acts of <hi>Perpetua,</hi> nor her sincerity in relating her Dream: but must the Church build her Doctrines upon the Dreams or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of young Ladies, tho very devout? for <hi>Ubia Perpetua</hi> was then but Twenty Two, as she saith her self. But none are to be blamed who m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke use of the best supports their Cause will afford.</p>

And for the raising of these affections in his Soul, and filling his Heart with the extasies of Love and Devotion, he thinks in this case, there's little need of Words; a true <hi>Faith,</hi> without these, is all-sufficient. Who could but have burst forth into Tears of Love and Thanksgiving, if he had been present while our Saviour was tyed to <hi>Pillar, Scourg'd</hi> and <hi>Tormented,</hi> though he open'd not his mouth to the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standers, nor spake a word? who would have needed a <hi>Sermon</hi> to have been fill'd with <hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>Compassion,</hi> if he had seen his <hi>Saviour</hi> expos'd to the <hi>scorn</hi> of the <hi>Iews,</hi> when he was made a bloody spectacle by <hi>Pilate,</hi> with, <hi>Ecce homo, Lo the Man</hi>?

Can he believe that he that gives his life for the World, and died for our sins, is there before him, and not be touch'd with <hi>sorrow</hi> and <hi>contrition</hi> for his <hi>Offence</hi>?

Words</hi> could be? And if he must needs have <hi>Words,</hi> let him behold with the eye of <hi>Faith</hi> the <hi>gaping Wounds</hi> of his <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and see if those <hi>speak</hi> nothing to his <hi>Soul</hi>?

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>estion in short is, Whether the Church Service, at which Persons are bound to assist, ought not to be in a Language understood by those who are bound to assist?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:60203:66"/>For our Author grants, <hi>That a Papist is bound to assist at the Church Service, and to hear</hi> Mass; but he is not bound to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Words there spoken.</p>
            <p>This is a plain state of the case; and one would have thought St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Discourse about Edification in the Church-Service, and a known Tongue, and the Primitive Practice, had des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rved a little consideration, but not a Word is said to either of them; and the whole is so managed, as tho there had been no Rule, or any appearance of Practice to the contrary. But I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what he doth say.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Mass is a Sacrifice:</hi> And what then? Have they no other Church-Service but the <hi>Mass?</hi> What then becomes of their Breviaries, Litanies, and all other Offices? But suppose the Priests Office in the <hi>Mass,</hi> be to offer the Sacrifice; are there no Prayers in the Canon of the <hi>Mass,</hi> wherein the People are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned? Why must not they understand what they are required to assist in <hi>Prayer</hi> for? If they have <hi>English</hi> Books, as he saith, to teach them every part and Ceremony of the <hi>Mass,</hi> why not as well the Prayers in the <hi>Mass,</hi> wherein they are to joyn? They tell us, <hi>It is unseasonable then for the People to say their Beads, and other Devotions</hi>: And I suppose as unseasonable to talk, or think of other matters. Why then should not they know what it is they are to do, and what Petitions they are then to make to God? Are there no Responses to be made? No Lessons to be read? No Creed to be professed? Doth not the Priest speak to the People to pray, and they answer him? Is there no Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving after the Communion which the People is concerned in? We are as much for <hi>their Devout Affections</hi> as they can be, but we think they are not hindred by understanding what they are about: We cannot but wonder, that any man should say, <hi>That it nothing concerns his Devotion that the</hi> Mass <hi>is in</hi> Latin, if he understand it not. Is it no part of Devotion to joyn in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers, not merely by rote, but from a due apprehension of the matter contained in them? He requires, <hi>That they accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the Priest in Prayer and Spirit</hi>: And why not in understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also? <hi>But the Church hath so ordered it:</hi> And that is the thing we complain of, as done against St. <hi>Paul,</hi> against the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, against the natural sense of Mankind, who think it is sit for them to know what they do, especially in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of God: <hi>But it is to preserve Unity</hi>: Methinks however Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Spirit and Understanding is better than without it: <hi>There are other good Reasons</hi>: I know not one good one; and if there were more, he would have produced them: <hi>The greatest part is said in a low Voice, that it is not possible he should hear it:</hi> And to what purpose should it be spoken louder, if they are not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it? But why so low in publick? Yet the People might have Books, and joyn, if they understood what was said. But why should not the rest be understood, which is spoken as if it were?</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to other Offices, he saith, <hi>He is taught, that he may perform them in a Language which he understands not, with great benefit to his Soul, and the acceptance of God, if at those occasions he endeavours to raise his Thoughts to Heaven, and fix his Heart upon his Maker.</hi> But the Question is not, Whether a Man may not have devout Thoughts at that time, but whether he can perform his part in the publick Offices, with true Devotion, without Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding? for the publick Offices of Devotion were designed for the uniting the Hearts and Desires of the People in the same things. It is not, whether one Man may not pray for Heaven, and another for fair Weather, and another for pardon of his Sins, and a Fourth for Patience, and so on, in the same place, and at the same time; for all this may be done as well in a <hi>silent Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> where not a Word is spoken: But there being one Form of Prayer for all to joyn together in that with the united force of the whole Congregation, their Petitions may go up to Heaven; The matter now in dispute is, Whether it be not necessary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to this united Devotion, that the People all know what they pray for? And one would think nothing need to be said to prove this: But what our Author adds in Justification of this, overthrows all publick Devotion; for he saith, <hi>It is not necessary to have atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the Words, or on the Sense of Prayers, but rather purely on God</hi>: Which is to make all publick Forms unnecessary, and to turn all Devotion into <hi>Prayer</hi> of <hi>Contemplation</hi>: For if this be true, all Forms whatsoever are not only useless, but burthensome; and by the stinting the Spirit, do hinder the nimbler flights of the Soul in pure silence towards God: And this Principle must lead men to <hi>Enthusiasms,</hi> and unintelligible Unions; and make them despise <hi>Forms</hi> as a mean and dull Dispensation.</p>

I wish he had told us in what publick Office of their Church it is to be found: But
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60203:68"/>
himself pleads for the leaving it out, when he saith. <hi>The People are in no danger of Superstition or Idolatry by it; since the First Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment secures them from it; and there is nothing in this, but what is vertually contained in the First, and is rather an Explanation, than a new and distinct Precept.</hi> But is this so plain and clear, that a Mans Conscience can never make any just and reasonable Doubt concerning it? There is a terrible sanction after it; and men had need go upon very good Grounds in a matter of such moment. Hath God himself any where declared this to be only an Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the First Commandment? Have the Prophets, or Christ and his Apostles ever done it? How then can any mans Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be safe in this matter? For it is not a trifling Controversie, whether it be a distinct Commandment, or an Explication of the First, but the Lawfulness or Unlawfulness of the Worship of Images depends very much upon it: For if it be only an Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the First, then unless <hi>one takes Images to be Gods,</hi> their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is lawful, and so the Heathens were excused in it, who were not such Ideots: But if it be a new and distinct Precept, then the Worshipping any Image or Similitude, becomes a grievous sin, and exposes men to the Wrath of God in that severe manner mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the end of it: And it is a great confirmation that this is the true meaning of it, because all the Primitive Writers of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, not only thought it a sin against this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but insisted upon the force of it against those Heathens who denied that they took their Images for Gods: And therefore this is a very insufficient Account of leaving out the <hi>Second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That their Church doth allow any Equivocations, or Mental Reservations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the former, I am sincerely glad to find a Principle so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to all humane Society, so utterly disowned, when he saith, <hi>He is taught to keep Faith with all sorts of People, of whatsoever Iudgment or Perswasion they be; and to stand to his Word, and observe his Promise given, or made to any whatsoever.</hi> And whatever Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Practices there may have been of that kind formerly, we hope there will never be occasion given to revive that dispute.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the Second, We embrace his Declaration against it, and hope there is no Equivocation, or Mental Reservation in it. But there are some things which must here be taken notice of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He cannot deny that there are Authors in Communion with his Church, which may be charged with teaching another Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and those not a few, nor inconsiderable; who not only allow the Practice of Mental Reservations and Equivocations, but say with great confidence, it hath been received in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church for no less than Four hundred Years; and that in some Cases they are all still agreed in it. See <hi>Parsons</hi> Treatise of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation, c.</hi> 7. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.3. <hi>c.</hi> 10 <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We do not deny, that <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. hath condemned Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations and Mental Reservations in Swearing, as <hi>at least scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous and pernicious in Practise</hi>; and therefore we cannot charge the Pope with abetting this Doctrine. But we cannot but reflect on what our Author said about the Deposing Doctrine, <hi>That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho Popes had believed it, and acted by it, yet the greater number opposed it.</hi> And what shall we say in this Case; if the Generality of their Casuists in some Cases approve it, and think it no <hi>Lye</hi> or <hi>Perjury,</hi> as in that of <hi>Confession</hi>; but if it be really so in any one Case, then it may be some other fault; but it is not a <hi>Lye</hi> or <hi>Perjury</hi> in any other, when a Man doth not think himself bound to speak all he knows.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That as we highly commend the Pope's condemning such Doctrines and Pract<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>WE have no difference with them about this matter, as far as they hold to these points: 1. <hi>That men are strictly obliged to work out their Salvation with fear and trembling in time of health</hi>: 2. <hi>That it is very dangerous to defer their Repentance to the last.</hi> 3. <hi>That if any are surprised, they ought in Charity to have all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible assistance, to put them into the best way for their Salvation.</hi>

            <p>But yet there may be some particular Doctrines owned in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which may give men too much encouragement to put off true Repentance; as 1.

            <p>THE Question here is, Whether a Man doth not observe their Churches Command about Fasting, who forbears all forbidden things, but takes liberty in those which are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:60203:71"/>It is not, Whether they may not break the Commands of God, against <hi>Gluttony</hi> and <hi>Drunkenness</hi>; but whether they break the Law of the Church about Fasting? And notwithstanding what our Author hath said, I see no Reason for the Affirmative. I do not deny, 1. That it is a very indifferent sort of Fasting, <hi>to abstain from Flesh, unless all other sorts of Excesses at the same time be carefully avoided.</hi> 2. <hi>That Excesses on such days are more scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, because there is a pretence of Fasting.</hi> 3. <hi>That God's Command doth at all times forbid Intemperance.</hi> Which are the chief things he insists upon. But yet this doth not reach the point, which is about their <hi>Churches Command.</hi> For their Casuists distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish Fasting into 1. <hi>Natural</hi>: which is total Abstinence: and this is required only in order to receiving the Eucharist. 2. <hi>Moral</hi>: which is the same with Temperance, or Fasting for Health. 3. <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical</hi>: which is defined by them to be, <hi>An Abstinence from Food forbidden by the Church.</hi> And if this Definition be true, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be broken but by eating what the Church hath prohibited.</p>
            <p>And therefore their Casuists, as far as I can find, are agreed in these things;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That a Man may eat a full Meal of what is not forbidden, and not break the Churches Precept of Fasting, provided Vespers be first said. And the later Casuists blame <hi>Covarruvias</hi> for making any scruple about it. <hi>If a Mans Excess comes to be a mortal Sin,</hi>

            <head>XXIX. Of Divisions and Schisms in the Church.</head>
            <p>TWO things he saith upon this Head:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That they are all agreed in matters of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That they only differ in some School Points</hi>; from whence he infers, That they have no Schisms or Separations among them.</p>
            <p>But that this is no just consequence, will appear by the Schisms and Separations among us, made by such who profess to agree in all matters of Faith. Yet let us see how he proves that they agree in all matters of Faith; <hi>because they agree to submit equally to the Determinations of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this very way evidently proves that they do not all agree, because they do not equally submit to the Churches Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some say they are bound to submit to the Churches Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, as it represents the Universal Church; Others say no; but as the Churches Power is virtually lodged in the Guides of it. Now this is a very material Difference: for if it be on the former
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60203:73"/>
Account, then not the Popes and Councils Declarations are to be regarded, but as they express the sense of the Universal Church; and so the Majority of Votes, the Numbers in the Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Diffusive Church is chiefly to be regarded. And on this Ground some reject the Deposing Power, tho plainly decreed by Popes and Councils, but they unhinge their Churches Authority by it. Now how is it possible for them to agree about matters of Faith, who differ fundamentally about the way how any things come to be matters of Faith? If they be decreed by Popes and Councils say some; and so the Deposing Power is become an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith. No such matter, say others, for a greater Number in the diffusive Church oppose it, as in the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, and elsewhere. Very well! But how then can these Parties be said to agree in matters of Faith, and an equal Submission to the Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of the Church?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some again say, That it is not the consent of the present Church can make any Article of Faith, but there must be an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Tradition from the Apostles times. And so they tell us the Deposing Power can never be an Article of Faith, because it wants the Consent of all the Ages before <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. So that upon this Ground there can be no Article of Faith which cannot be proved to be thus delivered down to us. Others again say, this is in effect to give up their Cause, knowing the impossibility of proving parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Points in this manner: and therefore they say, the present Church is wholly to be trusted for the sense of the foregoing.</p>
            <p>Now these differences are still on foot in their Church; and from these do arise daily disputes about matters of Faith, and the Seat of Infallibility, whether in the Guides, or the Body of the Church: if the former, whether in the Church Representative, or Virtual? Whether the Personal Infallibility of the Pope be a matter of Faith or not? Our Author saith, Not; others say, Yes: and yet he saith, <hi>they are agreed in matters of Faith.</hi> So that by his own Confession they differ about other things than mere School-Points.</p>
            <p>But suppose they were <hi>agreed in Articles of Faith,</hi> can there be no Schisms or Divisions in their Church? What thinks he of all the Schisms between Popes and Popes? Of all the Schisms between the Popes and the Emperors Parties? Which were as notorious, and scandalous, and mischievous, as ever were in the World. What thinks he of the Schisms between the Bishops and the Regular
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60203:73"/>
Orders, which were as cross and peevish towards the Bishops and Secular Clergy, as our Dissenters themselves? And among the Regular Orders, what Heats and Contentions have been, <hi>Not about the practice of a devout Life,</hi> I assure him, but about matters of Doctrine; and which both Parties severally plead to be matters of Faith? As in the noted Controversies of this last Age, about the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin, the power of Grace, and the Pope's Personal Infallibility: and they cannot say they are as yet agreed about these things.</p>

            <p>OUR Dispute is not, about the lawfulness of retiring from the World by such Persons who are rendred unfit for doing Service in it; and the more they spend their time in Devotion and Contemplation, so much the better.</p>
            <p>But it lies in these Things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether the Perfection of a Christian State of Life lies in being cloystered up from the World, or labouring to do good in it? For this was the great snare made use of, to draw men into it, because they represented this as the most perfect state; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as according to the Doctrine and Example of Christ and his Apostles, the active Life of doing good, is far beyond it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether, although such a Retirement be allowed, it be a thing pleasing to God, to tye such Persons up by indispensable Vows, whatever their Circumstances may be, not to alter that State of Life; who either in Youth, or through Force, Passion, or Discontent, have entred into it? And this may be so much rather questioned, because those who assert the Pope may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spense, go upon this ground, Because Circumstances may alter the Obligation of a Vow; and when a greater good is to be attained it ceaseth to oblige; which to my Apprehension doth not prove the Pope's Power to dispense, but the dispensable Nature of the Vows themselves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether all things of this nature being liable in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of time to great Degeneracy and Corruptions; and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of such Places being unserviceable either to Church or State, it be not in the Power of the King and States of the Kingdom, to dissolve and reduce them to ways more suitable to the Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of both?</p>
            <p>As to what he discourses about <hi>Councils of Perfection, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions of the World, the Corruptions of the best Things,</hi> &amp;c. they reach not the main Points, but are only general Topicks, which we are not concerned to debate.</p>

They are extremely to blame who charge a Church with what her Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers do in direct Opposition to her Doctrine; but it is quite another Case, when the main Ground they alledge for their Actions is some allowed Principle in it. 4. <hi>They are not accountable for the Actions of every Bishop, Cardinal, or Pope; for they extend not their Faith beyond the Declaration of General Councils.</hi> But suppose General Councils have declared such Doctrines, and Popes act but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to them; is not their Church then accountable for their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? 5. <hi>There is more Praying and Fasting. and receiving the Sacraments, more visiting the Prisoners, and the Sick, more Alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving in any of our neighbouring Popish Towns, as</hi> Paris, Antwerp, Gant, <hi>&amp;c. than in any Ten Towns of the Reformation.</hi> And is there more <hi>Charity</hi> too?

            <p>We see no reason to admire or imitate the manner of their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Fasting, and receiving the Sacraments; for <hi>to pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out understanding,</hi> to <hi>fast without Abstinence,</hi> to <hi>receive a maimed Sacrament,</hi> are things we do not envy them for; but althô our Devotion be not so pompous, and full of shew, yet We may pray and fast in secret, according to our Saviours Directions, far more than they do; however our People are mightily to blame if they do not understand what they pray for, if they do not receive more of the Sacrament than they; and we verily believe there are as great and remarkable Instances of <hi>true Charity</hi> among those of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as among any People in the World.</p>

            <p n="2">2. He sees no Reason <hi>to doubt the truth of many Miracles, which are attested by great numbers of Eye-witnesses, examined by Authority, and found upon Record, with all the Formalities due to such a Process.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, how can these two things stand together? Is not a Man obliged to believe a thing so well proved? And if his other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments prove any things, it is, that he is bound to believe them. For he thinks there is as much Reason to believe Miracles still, as in the time of the old or new Law. If he can make this out, I see no reason why he should not be as well obliged to believe them now,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60203:78"/>
as those recorded in Scripture. But I can see nothing like a proof of this. And all Persons of Judgment in their own Church, do grant there is a great difference between the Necessity of Miracles for the first establishing a Religion, and afterwards. This is not only as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted by <hi>Tostatus, Erasmus, Stella, Andradius,</hi> and several others formerly; but the very late <hi>French</hi> Author I have several times men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, saith it in expr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ss Terms.<note place="margin">Moyens Surs &amp; Honestes. &amp;c. To. 2. p. 149.</note> And he confesses the great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postures of modern Miracles, which, he saith, ought to be severely punished; and that none but Women and weak People think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves bound to believe them. And he cannot understand what they are good for: Not to convert Hereticks; because not done among them: Not to prove there are no corruptions or errors among them, which is a thing incredible; with much more to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and so concludes with <hi>Monsieur Paschal, That if they have no better use, we ought not to be amused with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But Christ promised, that his Apostles should do greater Miracles than himself had done.</hi> And what then? Must therefore S. <hi>Francis,</hi> or S. <hi>Dominic,</hi> or S. <hi>Rosa,</hi> do as great as the Apostles had done? What Consequence can be drawn from the Apostles times to latter Ages? We do not dispute <hi>God's Omnipotency, or say his hand is shortned</hi>; but we must not from thence infer, that every thing which is called a Miracle is truly so; or make use of God's Power, to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify the most incredible stories. Which is a way will serve as well for a false as a true Religion; and <hi>Mahomet</hi> might run to Gods Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency for cleaving the Moon in two pieces, as well as others for removing a House over the Seas, or any thing of a like nature.</p>
            <p>But, he saith, <hi>their Miracles are not more ridiculous and absurd than some in the Old Testament.</hi> Which I utterly deny; but I shall not run out into the examination of this Parallel, by shewing how very different the Nature, Design, and Authority of the Miracles he mentions, is from those which are believed in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. And it had been but fitting, as he set down the Miracles of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> so to have mentioned those of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church which were to vye with them; but this he was willing to forbear, for certain good Reasons. <hi>If most of poor Man's impossibles be none to God,</hi> as he concludes, yet every thing is not presently true which is not impossible; and by this way of Arguing, there can be nothing objected against the most absurd and idle Fictions of the Golden Legend, which all Men of Understanding among themselves, not only reject for want of Authority, but of Credibility.</p>

            <p>And now, as our Author saith, <hi>What Superstition in the use of it</hi>? He names several things of Gods own appointing to Parallel it; as <hi>the Waters of Iealousy, the Shew-bread, the Tables of Stone</hi>; but the first was miraculous, the other had no such effects that we ever heard of. <hi>Elisha's Salt for sweetning the Water,</hi> was undoubtedly a Miracle. Is the <hi>Holy-Water</hi> so? As to the <hi>Liver of the Fish for expelling the Devil,</hi> in the Book of <hi>Tobit,</hi> he knows the Book is not owned for Canonical by us; and this very place is produced as an Argument against it; there being no Ground from Scripture, to attribute the Power of expelling Devils, to the Liver of a Fish, either naturally or symbolically: <hi>Vallesius</hi> offers at the only proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble account of it,<note place="margin">Valles.

But these are sufficient to sanctifie the Water,</hi> saith our Author; And to what end?<note place="margin">De Cultu Sanct. <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> For all the spiritual and corporeal benefits before mentioned? Is no promise of God neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for such purposes as those? How can any Church in the World dispose of God's Power without his Will? It may appoint significant and decent Ceremonies, but it can never appropriate divine Effects to them; and to suppose any divine Power in things which God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gave them, is, in my Opinion, Superstition; and to use them for such ends, is a superstitious use. St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> whom he quotes, speaks of the Consecration of the Water of Baptism, <hi>Càtech.</hi> 3. St. <hi>Augustine</hi> only of a consecrated Bread, which the <hi>Catechumens</hi> had (<hi>De Peccat. Merit. &amp; Remiss.</hi> l. 2. c. 26.) but he attributes no divine Effects to it. Pope <hi>Alexanders Epistle</hi> is a notorious Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit. Those Passages of <hi>Epiphanius, Theodoret,</hi> and S. <hi>Ierom,</hi> all speak of miraculous effects; and those who had the power of Miracles might sometimes do them with an external sign, and sometimes without, as the Apostles cured with anointing, and without: But this is no ground for consecrating Oyl by the Church, or Holy Water, for miraculous Effects. If these Effects which they attribute to <hi>Holy Water</hi> be miraculous, then every Priest must have not only a power of Miracles himself, but of annexing it to the Water he consecrates; if they be super-natural, but not mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, then Holy Water must be made a Sacrament to produce these Effects <hi>ex opere operato;</hi> if neither one nor the other, I know not how to excuse the use of it from <hi>Superstition.</hi>

So that let a man be never so honest in his Dealing, never so just to his Neighbour, never so charitable to the Poor, and constant in his Devotion to his Maker; yet all this shall avail him nothing, if he be not a Member of his Church. 'Tis not enough for him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Iesus Christ, to confess him his Redeemer, to believe that he died for our Sins, that he rose again, and ascended into Heaven; unless he believes and assents to every Article and Tenet declar'd by any of his</hi> General Councils; <hi>for that obstinately to deny any one of these, does as certainly place him at the</hi> Left Hand <hi>of the</hi> Judge, <hi>as if he perversly stood out against the truth of Christianity, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>to be God.

condemned by the Primitive Church? What then is our Fault, which can merit so severe a Sentence? <hi>We oppose the Church</hi>: What Church? The Primitive Apostolical Church? The Church in the time of the four General Councils? I do not think that will be said, but I am sure it can never be proved: What Church then? <hi>The present Church?</hi> Is it then damnable to oppose the present Church? But I pray let us know what ye mean by it; <hi>The Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Body of Christians in the World?</hi> No, No, abundance of them are <hi>Hereticks and Schismaticks</hi> as well as we: <hi>i. e.</hi> All the Christians in the <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Southern</hi> parts, who are not in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> So that two parts in three of Christians are sent to Hell by this Principle; and yet it is no Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableness.

Suppose a man do not submit to the Guides of this Church in a matter of Doctrine declared by them, Must he be Damned? What if it be the Deposing Power? Yet his Principle is, <hi>If a Man do not hold the Faith entire, he is gone.</hi> But Popes and Councils have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared this to be a point of Faith; therefore if he doth not hold it, he must be damned. There is no way of answering this, but he must abate the severity of his Sentence against us. For upon the same Reason he questions that, we may question many more. And all his Arguments against us, will hold against himself; <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>he that disbelieves one Article of Catholick Faith, does in a manner disbelieve all.</hi> Let him therefore look to it, as well as we.

               <p>HIS Church has appointed a great number and variety of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to be used in the Celebrating <hi>Divine Service,</hi> in the <hi>Offices</hi> and the Administration of the <hi>Sacraments.</hi> She has likewise many <hi>Observances, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, Constitutions,</hi> appertaining to Discipline and the Government of the Flock. And all these are receiv'd, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, or instituted by her, every one in her Communion does embrace, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and willingly submit to, without opposition, exception, or calling any into question: because, altho the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars thus appointed or commanded be not to be found in Scripture; yet there being in the Scripture an express and absolute Command given to the whole Flock of Christ, of following and being obedient to those that have thus order'd these things; in virtue of that Command, they voluntarily, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out constraint, accept all that is of their Appointment; without excepting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any thing, unless it be manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sinful.

So that to them it seems a very fallacious rule, leading to all Confusion and unchristian Comentions, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Higher Powers, our Superiours, Pastors and Prelates, are not to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but only in such things as are express'd in Scripture; and as for any other Particulars, whosoever upon Examination cannot find what is commanded by them in <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> may lawfully refuse Submission; nay, he is oblig'd to resist. For however this seems to bear much of the Word of God in the face of it, yet certainly 'tis wholly destructive to it; and under pretence of adhering close to the Scripture, undermines the very Author of it. This the Primitive Christians understood so well, that they detested all such Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims, and following the Advice of the Apostle, chose rather to trust their Souls in the hands of those, whom God had plac'd over them, by an humble Submission to the Government, and a peaceable Obedience to their Decrees; than by a presumptuous questioning of every thing, and raising vain disputes, to take the <hi>Rule</hi> of the Flock out of the hands of those, to whom God had provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially deliver'd it, and place themselves Judges over the <hi>Church,</hi> their Elders, Prelates and Pastors, whom God had commanded them to hear, and be in Subjection to. So that we never read, that they ever pretended to weigh the Ordinances of their Superiors by their own reasoning, or to bring them to the Test of the Word of God, before the acceptance; but alway judg'd it conform to the Word of God, that their <hi>Governours</hi> should <hi>Rule,</hi> and they <hi>Obey.</hi> Thus when the Apostles observ'd the <hi>Sunday</hi> instead of the <hi>Sabbath</hi>; and met together at <hi>Pentecost</hi>; we don't read that the Faithful then began to turn over their Bibles, to find a Command for
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60203:86"/>
these particulars, but with a prompt Obedience readily followed them in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance. So when Abstinence from Blood and strangled Meats was order'd by the Elders assembled at <hi>Ierusalem; (Acts</hi> 15.) the multitude of Believers having heard the Decree, never murmur'd at it, or call'd it into question, however seemingly contrary to the intention of Christ, who in abrogating the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> was thought to have cut off all these Obligations; but they all <hi>rejoyced for the Consolation, (ib. v.</hi> 31.) So when St. <hi>Paul</hi> gave orders to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.) in what manner and posture they were to behave themselves at Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in their Assemblies, both Men and Women; we don't hear that he was challeng'd by any to shew by what authority of Scripture he thus reprov'd and prescrib'd in these Particulars, or by what they were ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And with this Doctrine of Obedience, Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and Submission, all the Primitive Christians were train'd up by the Apostles, who zealously laboured by this means to preserve them in Peace and Unity; that so they might think all the same thing, and be of one mind and one judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and without Divisions; insomuch, that there is not any one thing so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated in their Writings, as Exhortations to this Obedience and Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: See, how, going <hi>through the Cities they deliver'd to them</hi> (the Faithful) <hi>the decrees for to keep, that were ordain'd by the Apostles and Elders which were at Ierusalem, (Acts</hi>

                  </gap>6 4.) See how St. <hi>Paul</hi> commands the <hi>Thessalonians, to hold fast the Traditions they had been taught by word or by Epistle,</hi> (2 Thess. 2.15.) See how he commands the <hi>Hebrews; Obey them that have the rule over you. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them which have the Rule over you,</hi> (Heb. 13.7.17.) See with what ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness St. <hi>Iohn</hi> urges this; <hi>He that knoweth God heareth us, he that is not of God heareth us not,</hi> (1 Joh. 4.6.) <hi>hereby know we the Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Error.</hi> And then again, does not St. <hi>Paul</hi> commend the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for their Obedience; <hi>Now I praise you, Brethren, that you remember me in all things, and keep the Ordinances, as I deliver'd them to you,</hi> (1 Cor. 11.2.) And then, having given them directions as to their Behaviour in their Assemblies, he adds; <hi>But if any man seem to be contentious, We have no such custom, neither the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of God,</hi> (1 Cor. 11.16.) And now it being thus evident, that the Church of Christ in the Apostles time was founded, and preserv'd by a Submission and Obedience of the Flock to their Pastors; the <hi>Papists</hi> teach and believe, that what was taught and commanded by the Apostles to the Faithful then living, ought to be receiv'd as a Doctrine necessary for all succeeding Ages, and that Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Obedience ought to have been as much the Duty of Believers ever since as it was then; the Commands and Practice of that time being undoubtedly the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60203:86"/>
best and only Pattern for the Faithful for all times, even to the end of the World. And they do not only teach this Doctrine of Submission in their Books and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, but also observe it in their Lives, having in all Ages depended on their Elders and Prelates in all matters touching the Discipline and Government of the Church; leaving <hi>Rule</hi> to those whose Charge and Office it is to <hi>Rule;</hi> and never believing, that they, who are under Charge and Command expresly by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Remember</hi> and <hi>Obey</hi> those who have the <hi>Rule</hi> over them, can upon any pretence whatsoever, nay, thô an Angel from Heaven should come and Preach otherwise, be discharg'd from this Christian Obligation, and be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from <hi>Remembring</hi> and <hi>Obeying,</hi> whom thus by God, speaking by his Apostle, they are Commanded to <hi>Remember</hi> and <hi>Obey.</hi> And upon this ground it is, that in things concerning the <hi>Order</hi> to be observ'd in the <hi>Divine Service,</hi> in all <hi>Ceremonies; Holy Rites, Ecclesiastical Constitutions,</hi> and <hi>Ordinances,</hi> they have neither <hi>Nill</hi> nor <hi>Will</hi> of their own; but always receive, and think that the <hi>best,</hi> which is Order'd and Appointed by those, to whom, by <hi>Divine Law,</hi> they owe <hi>this Submission and Obedience,</hi> and to whom the Ordering and Appointing these things appertains. And therefore, if these appoint a Day of <hi>Humiliation</hi> for imploring God's Mercy, or averting his Judgments, they never scruple to observe it; if a day of <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> in memory of some signal Benefit, they likewise Obey. If these judge it fit, that on every <hi>Friday</hi> should be commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Death and Passion of our Redeemer in <hi>Fasting</hi>; and command <hi>Lent</hi> to be observ'd, in remembrance and imitation of our Lord's 40 days Fast in the Desart, they think it their obligation to do so. If these order such and such days to be set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and kept holy in Remembrance and Thanksgiving for the <hi>Incarnation, Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, Circumcision, Resurrection,</hi> and <hi>Ascension</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and for other such like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, they esteem it sinful to oppose it. If these judge it decent, that the Faithful shou'd <hi>bow</hi> at the Name of <hi>Iesus,</hi> stand at the reading of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> prostrate, or incline themselves at the <hi>Confession:</hi> If they appoint <hi>Tapers</hi> and <hi>Lamps</hi> to be used in <hi>Churches,</hi> to represent our Saviour who came to enlighten the World; and <hi>Incense</hi> to be used, to mind the People, that their Hearts and Prayers should, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>HIS Discourse on this Head is against those who refuse to obey their Superiours in things not expressed in Scripture, which is no part of our Controversie with them. But yet there are several things about their Ceremonies we are not satisfied in: As, 1. The mighty number of them which have so much muffled up the Sacraments, that their true face cannot be discerned. 2. The Efficacy attributed to them, without any promise from God; whereas we own no more but decency and significancy. 3.

to truth, say, that in any of these has been coin'd <hi>new Articles,</hi> or Christians forced to the acceptance of <hi>Novelties,</hi> contrary to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> or ancient <hi>Tradition.</hi> These have only trodden in the <hi>Apostles</hi> steps, as often as they have been in the like circumstances with them; doing exactly according to the Form and Example left to the Church by those perfect Masters of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And therefore as the <hi>Apostles</hi> in their Assembly, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. determin'd the Controversie concerning the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision</hi>; and proposed to the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful what was the Doctrine of Christ in that point, of <hi>necessity</hi> to be believ'd; of which till that Decision there had been rais'd several Questions and Doubts; but now no longer to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned, without the Shipwrack of Faith. So in all succeeding Ages the Elders of the Church, to whom the <hi>Apostles</hi> left their Commission of <hi>watching over the Flock,</hi> in their Councils have never scrupled to determine all such Points which had been controverted amongst the Brethren, and to propose to them what of <hi>necessity</hi> they were to believe for the future, with <hi>Anathema</hi> pronounced against all such as should presume to preach the contrary. Thus in the year 325. the first <hi>Nicene Council</hi> declar'd the Son of God to be <hi>Consubstantial</hi> to his <hi>Father,</hi> against the <hi>Arians</hi>; with an Obligation on all to assent to this Doctrine, though never till then propos'd or declar'd in that Form. Thus in the year 381. the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> was declar'd to be <hi>God;</hi> against <hi>Macedonius</hi> and his Followers, in the first <hi>Constantinopolitan Council.</hi> And in the first <hi>Ephesin, Anno</hi> 431. <hi>Nestorius</hi> was condemned, who maintain'd <hi>two Persons in Christ,</hi> and that the <hi>blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi> was the <hi>Mother of God</hi>; with a Declaration, That both these <hi>Tenets</hi> were contrary to the <hi>Catholick Faith.</hi> In the second <hi>Nicene Council, Anno</hi> 787. Image-breakers were Anathematiz'd. And so others at other times; and at last, in the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> was declar'd the <hi>Real Presence, Transubstantiation, Purgatory, the lawfulness of the Invocation of Saints, of keeping Holy Images, &amp;c.</hi> against <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Calvin, Beza,</hi> &amp;c. And now, tho in all these and the other <hi>General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi> the Persons condemned took occasion, from these <hi>New Declarations,</hi> to cry out, <hi>Novelties, Novelties,</hi> to fright the People with the noise of <hi>new coin'd Articles,</hi>

'Tis evident therefore to him, that this noise of <hi>Novelty,</hi> was nothing but a <hi>stratagem</hi> for the introducing of <hi>Novelties</hi>; and that those that brought an Infamy upon these Points, by this aspersion, might with as great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause every, and as easily have laid a scandal upon other Articles of the Christian Faith, which they thought sit to retain, and have had them all exploded for <hi>Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> And this has been so far done already, that even three parts of that Doctrine, pick'd out by the <hi>first Reformers,</hi> for <hi>Apostolical,</hi> and conform to the <hi>Word of God,</hi> we have seen in our days clamem'd against for <hi>Novelty,</hi> and thrown by with as general Approbation, and as clear Evidence of the charge, as ever they laid by <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> and the <hi>Primacy.</hi> The <hi>first Reformers</hi> cast off the Authority of the <hi>first Bishop</hi> as being a <hi>Novelty; Others</hi> soon alter cry'd down the Authority of <hi>all Bishops,</hi> for a <hi>Novelty.</hi> The <hi>First</hi> disown'd a great part of the <hi>Priestly Function,</hi> as being lately crept in; the <hi>Others</hi> disown'd all the rest, and even <hi>Ordination</hi> it self, as having all crept in together.

            <head>XXXVII. Of Innovation in matters of Faith.</head>
            <p>THE Substance of his Discourse on this Head may be reduced to these things. 1. <hi>That the Church in every Age hath Power to declare what is necessary to be believed, with Anathema to those who Preach the Contrary; and so the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>in decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Transubstantiation, Purgatory,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to be necessary Articles, did no more than the Church had done before on like Occasions.</hi> 2. <hi>That if the Doctrines then defined had been Innovations, they must have met with great Opposition when they were introduced.</hi> 3. <hi>That those who charged those points to be Innovations, might as well have laid the scandal on any other Article of Faith which they retained.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are things necessary to be examined, in order to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king good the charge of Innovation in matters of Faith, which we believe doth stand on very good Grounds.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are to consider, Whether the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> had equal Reason to define the necessity of these points, as the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Constantinople</hi> had to determin the point of the Trinity; or those of <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> the Truth of Christ's Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He doth not assert it to be in the Churches Power to make new Articles of Faith, as they do imply new Doctrines reveal'd; but he contends earnestly, That the Church hath a Power to declare the necessity of believing some points which were not so declared before. And if the Necessity of believing doth depend upon the <hi>Churches</hi> Declaration, then he must assert, that it is in the <hi>Churches</hi> Power to make points necessary to be believed which were not so; and consequently to make common Opinions to become Articles of Faith. But I hope we may have leave to enquire in this Case, since the <hi>Church</hi> pretends to no new Revelation of matters of Doctrine, therefore it can declare no more than it receives, and no otherwise than it receives. And so nothing can be made necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but what God himself hath made so by his Revelation. So that they must go in their Declaration either upon Scripture, or Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Tradition; but if they define any Doctrine to be necessary without these Grounds, they exceed their Commission, and there is no Reason to submit to their Decrees, or to believe their Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. To make this more plain by a known Instance: It is most certain that several Popes and Councils have declared the Desposing Doctrine, and yet our Author saith, <hi>It is no Article of Faith with him.</hi>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:60203:92"/>
Why not, since the Popes and Councils have as evidently delivered it, as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath done Purgatory, or Transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation? But he may say, <hi>There is no Anathema joined to it.</hi> Suppose there be not; But why may it not be, as well as in the other Cases? And if it were, I wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d know, whether in his Conscience he would then believe it to be a necessary Article of Faith, thô he believed that it wanted Scripture and Tradition? If not, then he seees what this matter is brought to, <hi>viz.</hi> That althô the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> declare these new Doctrines to be necessary to be believed; yet if their Declaration be not built on Scripture and Universal Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we are not bound to receive it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>As to the impossibility of Innovations coming in without notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opposition,</hi> I see no ground at all for it, where the alteration is not made at once, but proceeds gradually. He may as well prove it impossible for a Man to fall into a <hi>Dropsy</hi> or a <hi>Hectick-Fever,</hi> unless he can tell the punctual time when it begun. And he may as well argue thus, Such a Man fell into a Fever upon a great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch, and the Physicians were presently sent for to advise about him; therefore the other Man hath no Chronical Distemper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had no Physicians when he was first sick; as because Councils were called against some Heresies, and great Opposition made to them, therefore where there is not the like, there can be no <hi>Innovation.</hi> But I see no Reason why we should decline giving an Account, by what D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>grees, and Steps, and upon what Occasions, and with what Opposition several of the Doctrines defined at <hi>Trent</hi> were brought in. For the matter is not so obscure as you would make it, as to most of the Points in difference between us. But that is too large a Task to be here undertaken.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is no colour for calling in Question the Articles of Faith received by us on the same Grounds that we reject those defined by the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>; for we have the Universal Consent of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian World for the <hi>Apostles Creed</hi>; &amp; of the 4 General Councils for the Doctrines of the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Incarnation</hi>; who never pretended to determine any Point to be necessary which was not revea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Quarta.</note> for it first set up <hi>an Unwritten Word</hi> to be a Rule of Faith, as well as <hi>the Written</hi>; which althô it were necessary in order to their Decrees, was one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Innovations in the World; and the Foundation of all the rest, as they were there established.</p>

            <head>The CONCLUSION.</head>
            <p>THese are the <hi>Characters</hi> of the <hi>Papist,</hi> as he is <hi>Mis-represented,</hi> and as <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented.</hi> And as different as the <hi>One</hi> is from the <hi>Other,</hi> so different is the <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pist,</hi> as reputed by his Maligners, from the <hi>Papist,</hi> as to what he is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. The <hi>One</hi> is so absurd and monstrous, that 'tis impossible for any one to be of that Profession, without first laying by all thoughts of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and his <hi>Reason.</hi> The <hi>Other</hi> is just contradictory to this; and without any farther Apology, may be expos'd to the perusal of all prudent and unpassionate Considerers, to examine if there be any thing in it that deserves the hatred of any Christian: and if it be not in every Point wholly conform to the Doctrine of Christ, and not in the least contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Reason. The <hi>Former</hi> is a <hi>Papist,</hi> as he is generally apprehended by those who have a <hi>Protestant Education;</hi> such, as whensoever reflected on, is conceiv'd to be a perverse, malicious sort of Creature, <hi>Superstitious, Idolatrous, Atheistical, Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, Bloody-minded, Barbarous, Treacherous,</hi> and so <hi>Prophane,</hi> and every way <hi>Inhumane,</hi> that 'tis in some manner doubted, whether he be <hi>Man</hi> or no. The <hi>Other</hi> is a <hi>Papist,</hi> whose <hi>Faith</hi> is according to the Proposal of the Catholick Church; which by Christ's Command he is oblig'd to believe and hear, and whose whole design in this World is for obtaining Salvation in the next. And is it not strange, that these two Characters so directly opposite, so wholly unlike one the other, that Heaven and Hell is not more, should agree to the same person: 'Tis certainly a strange piece of Injustice, and yet not at all strange to those who know, that they that follow Christ shall be hated by the World, that those who study the Wisdom of Heaven shall have the repute of Fools; and that as many as attend the <hi>Lamb,</hi> shall be painted in the Livery of <hi>Satan.</hi> Our Fore-fathers were so before us; all the Primitive Christians, the Apostles, and even the <hi>Lamb</hi> himself, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. <hi>Calumny</hi> ever follow'd them, <hi>Mis representation</hi> waited upon them; and what wonder that <hi>Infamy</hi> was their constant Attendance? And now if the <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Christians</hi> have thus in all Ages had their <hi>double Character,</hi> one of <hi>Justice,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly drawn from what they really believ'd and practis'd; the other of <hi>Malice,</hi> copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them, as <hi>Mis-represented;</hi> 'tis not at all strange to find it so now in our days, when <hi>Calumny, Malice, Ignorance, &amp;c.</hi> are as powerful as ever; who, though from the beginning of the World, that is above five thousand Years, they have made it their chief business to Paint, Copy, and Represent Things and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; yet they never did it with so much injury, so altogether <hi>unlikely,</hi> as they do now to the <hi>Papists;</hi> there being scarce any one Point of their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> which they do not blindly mistake, or basely disguise. The <hi>Papists</hi> believe 'tis convenient to pray before <hi>Holy Images,</hi> and give them an <hi>inferiour</hi> or <hi>relative</hi> Respect. <hi>These</hi> describe the <hi>Papists</hi> Praying to <hi>Images,</hi> and Worshipping them

as <hi>Idols.</hi> The <hi>Papists</hi> believe 'tis good to desire the Prayers of the <hi>Saints,</hi> and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them as the Friends of God <hi>These</hi> paint out the <hi>Papists</hi> as believing <hi>Saints</hi> to be their <hi>Redeemers,</hi> and Adoring them as <hi>Gods.</hi> The <hi>Papists</hi> believe, that Christ left a Power in the Priests of his Church, to absolve all truly Penitent Sinners from their Offences. <hi>These</hi> Representing the <hi>Papists</hi> as believing, That the Priests can infallibly forgive all such as come to Confession, whether they Repent or no. The <hi>Papists</hi> believe there's Power in the <hi>Supreme Pastor,</hi> upon due Motives, of granting <hi>Indulgences;</hi> that is, of releasing to the Faithful such Temporal Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties as remain due to their past Sins, already remitted as to their guilt, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they perform such Christian Duties as shall be assign'd them, <hi>i. e.</hi> humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by Fasting, confess their Sins with a hearty Repentance, receive worthily, and give Alms to the Poor, <hi>&amp;c.

The <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> believe, That by the Merits of Christ, the good Works of a just Man are accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, and through his Goodness and Promise meritorious of eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. <hi>These</hi> report, That the <hi>Papists</hi> believe they can <hi>merit</hi> Heaven by their own Works, without any dependance on the work of our Redemption.

Anathema's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It belongs only to the Church and the General Councils to pronounce Anathema's, and not to any private Person whatsoever.</hi> So that if he would have published <hi>Anathema's</hi> with Authority, he ought to have printed those of the Council of <hi>Trent; viz.</hi> such as these,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cursed is he that doth not allow the Worship of Images.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cursed is he that saith Saints are not to be Invocated.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Cursed is he that doth not believe Transubstantiation, Purgatory,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because he leaves out an <hi>Anathema</hi> in a very material point, <hi>viz. As to the Deposing Doctrine.</hi> We do freely, and from our Hearts <hi>Anathematize</hi> all such Doctrines as tend to dissolve the Bonds of Allegiance to our Sovereign, on any pretence whatsoever. Why was this past over by him, without any kind of <hi>Anathema?</hi> Since he seems to approve the <hi>Oxford Censures.</hi> Why did he not here shew his zeal against all such dangerous Doctrines? <hi>If the Deposing Doctrine</hi> be falsly charged upon their Church, let us but once see it <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized</hi> by publick Authority of their Church, and we have done: But instead thereof, we find in a Book very lately published with great Approbations, by a present <hi>Professor</hi> at <hi>Lovain Fr.

               <p>We do not question but there are Divines that oppose it; but we fear there are too many who do not; and we find they boast of their own numbers, and despise the rest as an inconsiderable Party: This we do not <hi>Misrepresent</hi> them in, for their most approved Books do shew it.</p>
               <p>However, we do not question, but there are several Worthy and Loyal Gentlemen of that Religion, of <hi>different Principles and Practices</hi>; and it is pity such be not distinguished from those who will not renounce a Doctrine so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in the Consequences of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Because the <hi>Anathema's</hi> he hath set down, are not Penned so plainly and clearly as to give any real Satisfaction; but with so much Art and Sophistry, as if they were intended to beguile weak and unwary Readers, who see not into the depth of these things, and therefore may think he hath done great matters in his <hi>Anathema's,</hi> when if they be strictly examined, they come to little or nothing; as,</p>

                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:60203:102"/>1. <hi>Cursed is he that commits Idolatry.</hi> An unwary Reader would think herein he disowned all that he accuses of <hi>Idolatry</hi>; but he doth not curse any thing as <hi>Idolatry,</hi> but what himself thinks to be so. So again, <hi>Cursed is he</hi> (not that gives Divine Worship to Images, but) <hi>that prays to Images or Relicks as Gods, or Worships them for Gods.</hi> So that if he doth not take the Images themselves for Gods, he is safe enough from his own <hi>Anathema.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Cursed is every Goddess worshiper, i. e.</hi> That believes the Blessed Virgin not to be a Creature. And so they escape all the force of this <hi>Anathema.

                  </gap>nour her and trust in her but just as much as in God, they are safe enough; <hi>Or that believes her to be above her Son:</hi> But no <hi>Anathema</hi> to such as suppose her to be equal to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Cursed is he that believes the Saints in Heaven to be his Redeemers, that prays to them as such.</hi> What if men pray to them as their <hi>Spiritual Guardians and Protectors?</hi> Is not this giving God's Honour to them? Doth this deserve no <hi>Anathema?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Cursed is he that worships any Breaden God, or makes Gods of the empty Elements of Bread and Wine</hi>: viz. That supposes them to be <hi>nothing but Bread and Wine,</hi> and yet supposes them to be <hi>Gods</hi> too. Doth not this look like non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense? And yet I am afraid our Author would think it a severe <hi>Anathema</hi> in this matter, to say, <hi>Cursed is he who believes Nonsense and Contradictions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It will be needless to set down more, since I have endeavoured by clear stating the several Controversies to prevent the Readers being imposed upon by deceitful <hi>Anathema's.</hi> And yet after all he saith,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cursed are we, if in answering and saying</hi> Amen <hi>to any of these Curses, we use any Equivocations or Mental Reservations, or do not assent to them in the common and obvious use of the Words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there may be no Equivocation in the very Words, and yet there may be a great one in the intention and design of them: There may be none in saying <hi>Amen</hi> to the Curses so worded: but if he would have prevented all suspicion of Equivocation, he ought to have put it thus;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cursed are we if we have not fairly and ingenuously expressed the whole mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Church as to the Points condemned in these Anathema's; or if we have by them designed to deceive the People</hi>: And then I doubt he would not so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily have said <hi>Amen.</hi>
