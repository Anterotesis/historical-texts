            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PRAEFACE.</head>
            <p>JEntle Reader, I haue sette down heere in a dialogue, the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize of Sathan which hee vseth (as I haue obserued by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) to subuert and vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne the course of the gospel here in England: the names of the speakers containe in them for the moste parte, the matter that they defend, and the affection that they are of. For thou knowest that <hi>Diotrephes</hi> was hee of whom S. Iohn speaketh in his third Epi. v. 9. that louing to haue the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, disturbed the course of good things in the Church, and therefore su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staineth the person of a Bishop, or by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoplie prelate. <hi>Tertullus</hi> is he of whom Luke speaketh in the 24. Acts, that was the speaker in the ambassage from Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem to Foelix the gouernor, against <hi>Paule,</hi> in the defence of ceremonies, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogated from the ouerthrowe of the Gospell, and so representeth the Papists, that maintaine their trash, to the roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of true religion. <hi>Demetrius</hi> is he of whom mention is made in Actes
<pb facs="tcp:20279:3"/>
19. that was enemie to <hi>Paule,</hi> because he liued by an vnlawfull trade, and for that cause doth play the part of an vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. <hi>Paule</hi> was the defender you knowe of the Gospell in sinccritie, &amp; he whose pen the holy Ghost did vse to expresse the discipline of the church most clere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and therefore speaketh for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of our time that stand for refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. <hi>Pandocheus</hi> is an In-keeper in Greeke, and it is as much as to say, a receiuer of all, and a soother of euerie man for his gaine; so that the persons in their nature thus considered, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth that thou wouldest be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by me, whosoeuer thou art, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this little booke shall come, that thou wouldest in reading of it, set all affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aside, &amp; neither beleeue it, because one of thy disposition did pen it neither yet rei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r well of the speeches vttered by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie partie, &amp; compare them with the practize of the worlde, and then looke what it is that so hardeneth Pandoche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us in Atheisine, Demetrin in vsurie, &amp; Tertullus in Papistrie; and you shall (I
<pb facs="tcp:20279:3"/>
doubt not) plainely perceiue, that the cause of all vngodlines so to raigne in euery place, and of the Papists so to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in strength and number, ariseth from our Byshops and their vnlawfull gouernement; on the other side, looke into the answers that Diotrephes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to Paul, and the councell that Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus giueth to Diotrephes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them with the practize of the B. in all pointes, and you shall euidentlye perceiue that the cause why the gospel being so long preached, &amp; hath taken so little effect, ariseth from them onely, forsomuch as they haue weakened the knees of the true Preachers, and euerie way crossed them in all good actions. I haue touched thinges verie briefly of purpose, partly for that they who see what reformation meaneth, will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderstand my meaning, and partly, for that I would haue him that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth not mine intent and would be resolued, to confer at large of it wyth some godly learned for his further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. Now I pray thee, let mee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat thee to think thus of mine intent; namely, that it is not of purpose to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
<pb facs="tcp:20279:4"/>
any man, albeit we ought to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace them, by whom God his sonne is disgraced: but especially to this end, that euery man in his calling, might see howe hee is or hath beene made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument to do harme, or for want ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of knowledge, or prouident fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast, being ouertaken vnder colour of right and law, &amp; lastly that we al seeing the subtilties of the deuill againste the kingdom of Christ Iesus, may first of al returne to God by speedie repentance, from the wickednesse that we haue in our hands, which in deede is the cause of this cursse vpon vs; and then praie vnto his Maiestie, that he would detect the craftie subtilties of all his aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, reueale the trueth to those that are seduced and abused, and erect the kingdome of his Sonne Christ Iesus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs, by the forme of that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline that his owne worde expresseth vnto vs.</p>

               <p>You say well, and I percciue it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to haue a Papist, than a Puritane in  an house, and more charitie to do for them.</p>

newes, but your speach of your being, and ill successe that you hadde in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, giueth me occasion, to enquire of you (if I may be so bolde) Some Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish newes.</p>
            </sp>

               <p>Ah my hoste, though it grieue mee to thinke vppon it, yet it easeth my sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke  to tell it out. The Puritanes in Scotland, haue got vp their discipline, and vtterly ouerthrowen all the soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie of Bishops, by which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed so mightilie, that we feared our fall in England shortlie to ensue, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon I was sent togither with this my friend, who came out of Fraunce into England, to go and seeke the subuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their great assemblies, and the rest of their iurisdiction, wherein I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed a while, but nowe it is woorse, than euer it was.</p>

               <p>How came it to passe, that when you  had gotten some ground, you held it not?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>Because the whole land cried out for  Discipline againe, and the noble men so stifly did stand to it, and lastly, the Ministers that came home from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, dealt so boldelie with the King,
<pb facs="tcp:20279:7"/>
that I was vtterlie cast out without all hope, euer to do any good there again, and nowe I make homewarde in haste, least I loose all there also, but I praye you helpe me to speake with that Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane, I shall learne more by him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is better acquainted wyth the cause than either of you.</p>

               <speaker>Paule</speaker>
               <p>Whence are they can you tell? </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pandoch</speaker>
               <p>They are English men, but they are  but new come out of Scotland.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paule</speaker>
               <p>I am willing to go to them, though it be late, and so much the rather, bicause  I long to heare some good newes from thence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pandoch</speaker>
               <p>Here is the Gentleman that you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to speake withall. </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>You are welcome my frind, I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to speak with you, for that I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue  you came from London, I praie you, can you tell vs any good newes?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paule</speaker>
               <p>No surely, for I am a verie ill obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of such things. </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>You seeme to be a Minister, can you tell me what good successe my Lordes  the Bishops haue in their proceedings?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paule</speaker>
               <p>They haue too good successe, they wax worse and worse, they grow euen  to the heigth of their iniquitie, so that I hope their kingdom wil not stand long.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>Why sir, what doe they, that they  offend you so grieuously?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paule</speaker>
               <p>They stop the mouth of the sheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardes,  and set at liberty the rauening
<pb facs="tcp:20279:8"/>
wolues, and turne the foxes among the lambes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>I must desire you to expresse your minde more plainely, for you seeme to  bee so possessed with discontentment, that it maketh you to speak (as it were) snatchingly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paule</speaker>
               <p>I confesse my selfe discontented, and greatly grieued, but yet not so much, as  to make mee lesse able to expresse my minde.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>I pray you therefore, lay open your former speeches, that I may vnderstand  your meaning.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paule</speaker>
               <p>My meaning is this; That there are three abhominations committed by  them: The first is, that they do beare such an enmity against the kingdome of Iesus Christ, that they put to silence one after an other, and will neuer cease (if God bridle them not) vntill they haue rooted out of the Church, all the learned, godly, and painefull teachers: The second is, that they enlarge the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of the common enemies the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists: The last is, that they commit the feedinge of the flockes of Christe, vnto those that prey vpon them, and eyther
<pb facs="tcp:20279:8"/>
cannot, or will not labour to reclaime the wandering sheepe. So that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions that may bee gathered vppon their actions, must needes be the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and ouerthrow of the Gospell, and so consequently the bringing in of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and atheisme.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>They put none to silence, but the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans, who do indeede more hurt than  good.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paule</speaker>
               <p>I know no puritans, if there be anie, it is meete that they be put to silence:  But Sathan taught the Papistes, so to name the ministers of the Gospell, and you are his instrument in continuing the same rerme.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>I meane them, that are not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the estate, but mislike the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement  of the Church, and woulde haue a newe forme of gouernement, which would marre all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paule</speaker>
               <p>Woulde you haue them contented with Antichristian prelates, to bee ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers  of the spouse of Christ, when as the word of God hath prescribed expresly, another form direct contrary to that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>I am a doctor of diuinity at the least, and yet could I neuer reade any thing
<pb facs="tcp:20279:9"/>
in the worde of God, contrarie to this gouernement, neyther yet to speake of any other, but that the ordering of the Church is left to the discretion of the wise and learned.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paule</speaker>
               <p>Yes, you haue read it, if God had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen you eyes to see it: But if your stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy  had beene principally to aduaunce Gods glorie, and benefite his Church, which you neuer aymed at, but rather preferred vaine glorye and gaine, you should easily haue found it. I pray you therefore, when you come to London, see if you can get these bookes: the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Discipline: A lerned discourse of Ecclesiasticall gouernement: The Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyson: A Sermon vpon the</hi> 12. <hi>to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, &amp; M. Cartwrites</hi> last reply: some of which bookes haue bene extant this dozen yeeres, and yet are none of them answered, and you shall finde it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>If their Lordsh, were taken away, the  credite of the Gospell would fall to the ground, and men would not regarde it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paule</speaker>
               <p>Nay, their iurisdiction maketh it not  to be regarded, for the simplicitie of the Gospell, can not match with such
<pb facs="tcp:20279:9"/>
outward pompe, it was of more credit before their calling was hatched, than euer it was since.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>I hope neuer to see the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouerthrown,  and I thinke they will neuer giue ouer their Byshopricks.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paule</speaker>
               <p>I am of your mind, that they wil ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer  giue them ouer, they haue such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the gaine of them, the vse of the bagge preuailed so much with one of their Apostles, that rather than hee woulde lacke money, he would sell Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ himselfe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>You speak too vnreuerently and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitablie  of these holy fathers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paule</speaker>
               <p>Surely I haue so much experience of  their impious dealing, that I canne no better esteeme of them in respecte of their plaees, than of the ennemies of God, but as they bee men, I will not cease to pray for them, that God would open their eies, that they may see their sinnes, and repent, which is the best waie to deale charitablie with them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>I pray you tell ne why these men be  put to silence, I am sure it is for theyr notorious misdemeanor.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paule</speaker>
               <p>I will tell you wherefore some of
<pb facs="tcp:20279:10"/>
them were put to silence; one had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with a Bishop about subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and he was restrained for that hee gaue his friende a coppie of his confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, another, because he taught that the Church of Antichrist was no parte of the Church of God, another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his praiers before and after Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were too long, and such like.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>Away, it is rather for not obseruing the booke of common praier, than for  any such thing as you speake of.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paule</speaker>
               <p>Indeed many are suppressed therfore, but if any man will giue them their ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles  and authoritie, they will giue hym leaue to vse his discreation wyth the Booke, as wee see by experience, for they vse the Booke and ceremonies as brieles to curb them that ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k at their lordlinesse, which is the onelie thing that they mind.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>Well, I loue not to heare these reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend fathers so abused, and therefore I  praye you talke no more of it, but if it please you, you may depart.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paule</speaker>
               <p>I am contented, onlie let me request you this one thing, that for so much as  GOD hath giuen you learning, you
<pb facs="tcp:20279:10"/>
would praye vnto God, to guide you with his grace, that you abuse it not to your owne destruction, but employ it to his glory, and the good of his church.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>I thanke you for your good counsell,  and so fare you well, we will talke more in the morning.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paule</speaker>
               <p>With a good will: I praye God our  talke may tend to a good end.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>M. <hi>Demetrius</hi> and mine hoste, howe like you this fellew? is hee not a sawcie merchant, to presume thus to speake against those that were Preachers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was borne? But this is the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of our nation, that euerie yong boy will take vppon him to reach the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and to reprooue them, for that their greene heades thinke that to bee true.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pandoch</speaker>
               <p>Your Lordship saith very well, I pray  you forget not to vrge him with that in the morning. For it must needs make him mute.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Demetri</speaker>
               <p>I promise you he is a bolde fellowe,  it is no maruayle, if such as hee is, doe stand stiffe against vs that be vnlerned, seeing they bee so bolde with you, I tel you, he tooke me vp as if I had bin but
<pb facs="tcp:20279:11"/>
a kitchin boye, and all because I saide I liued by my monie, and was of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trade, calling me caterpiller, thief, and murtherer, and saide plainely, that he that robbed in Stran-gate hole, was an honester man than I.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>You must take heed, that you do not oppresse your brother too much, but  as for these fellowes, it is their manner to be so bitter and sharpe, that they do euer with their preaching, more hurte than good.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Demetri</speaker>
               <p>I hope you wil course him tomorow  for it: but I pray you my L. let me haue a little talke betweene you and me, of a matter that now commeth in my mind; this man that is with you, and went and came in your company, what is he?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>To be plaine with you, he is a Papist. </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Demetri</speaker>
               <p>Papists are enemies to the Queenes  religion and lawes; I do therefore much maruaile, that he should be put in trust by the Bishops.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>The cause is this, he light into the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie  of one of our friendes, who confuted a Booke called the <hi>Abstract,</hi> and helped him so painefully with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons out of the Rhemish testament, and
<pb facs="tcp:20279:11"/>
other such like writers, to confute the Puritans, that he was thought a fit man aboue all other of his religion, to goe with me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Demetri</speaker>
               <p>Why, coulde you not haue had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther  of your relgion, but you must needs haue a Papist your assistant?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>No, no, if I had not had a Papist with  me, I could neuer haue looked to haue preuailed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Demetti</speaker>
               <p>Why so? I pray you tel me the reason  of that.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>Because our dignities and gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,  commeth wholy and euerie part thereof from the Pope, and is ruled and defended by the same canons, whereby his popedome is supported. So that if I had wanted their helpes, I had had none authoritie, eyther from God or man, no helpe either by reason or lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, whereby I could haue beene fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Demetri</speaker>
               <p>Why did you not rather take some  doctour of the Arches, to go with you?</p>

because they knowe not else howe to liue, &amp; therfore it was feared that they woulde not be sufficiently diligent in a matter that concerneth others.

               <p>Sir, I saide nothing to hym but the truth out of the worde of God, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning  of vsurie, by which he saide he liued, and shewed him the horriblenesse of the sinne, the inconueniences tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall that come of it in the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and the iudgements of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the practises thereof.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>Vsurie in deed in some sort is vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,  but it seemeth that you dealt not with the man, as meaning to win him, but rather by such sharpenes as might harden him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paule</speaker>
               <p>Surely my desire was to winne him, and therefore my purpose in reasoning  was, to lay open the sinne vnto him, and the cause why I dealt som what round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was this: hee confessed the scriptures that I alleadged, but so cauelled and wrangled against the cleare light there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conteined, that it appeared vnto me his purpose was, not onely to abide an vsurer, but also to iustifie it by the word of God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>Such chollerike fellowes as you doe  marre al, for you cannot deale mildely,

and so you trouble the conscience, and disquiet the minde of the weake.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Paule</speaker>
               <p>His conscience must be troubled by launcing, before that euer his soule can  be cured.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Paule</speaker>

               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>

            <sp>

               <p>Surely, that I thinke you are either a  B. or else brought vp in the schoole of a B. and woulde faine be one, for you doe vse your selfe verie like, as I haue knowne them do.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Paule</speaker>
               <p>In this, that wheras we reasoning of  vsurie, wherein your conscience is clear within, you are contented for the fauor of him, and for that you like not me, to maintain the same, and to disgrace the truth, because of the partie that defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it, who is not according to your humor.</p>

               <p>You may bee ashamed to speake to  of these holy fathers, I dare say, that

none of them euer did so.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Paule</speaker>
               <p>If mine eares had not heard it, mine eies seene, &amp; mine owne person had not  felt the experience thereof, I shoulde haue beene of your minde, for I once li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them, and their verie wicked dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings made mee looke into the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their calling, which I see now to be meere Antichristian: but shall I tell you one example among manic?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>I am willing to heare you, but I can neuer be brought to thinke so. </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paule</speaker>
               <p>Yet will I tell it you, that you may thinke of it, I was accused vnto the B.  of such crimes as were most slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and false, where vpon I desired him to send for mine accusers, and see how they coulde prooue, that I (if I were con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>icted) might be punished, or else they might haue the rewarde that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesters of the preachers of the Gospell do deserue: he graunted it me, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted a day, which being come, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than I (whome hee thought not to fauor his authoritie) should haue anie helpe at his handes, hee made mee a sleeueles aunswere, and sent mee away. Thus are Byshoppes coutented to bee
<pb facs="tcp:20279:15"/>
bawdes vnto al kinde of sinners, rather than they will any way seeme to further the ministerie of those whome they fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour not, and euen thus doe you: for your hatred vnto my person, maketh you to stand with that monstrous vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, but take hecde of it, for God will not be mocked, he seeth your dealing, and will iudge you accordingly, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer you can pretend the contrarie to the world.</p>

               <p>As for mine owne part, I passe not  what you speake: but let me aske you one question concerning these holie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and that is this, what reason is there that they should do anie good in any respect vnto any of you, seeing they knowe you to bee professed foes vnto their dignities.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paule</speaker>
               <p>Because they taking themselues to  be the fathers of the Church, shoulde haue a regarde to the good cause, and defend it without respect of persons.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>No sir, I see no reason in that, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue  all things, they must look to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, without whose authoritie the Gospell would be troden vnder foote: and therfore they may defend no cause

nor person further than may stand with their owne safety.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paule</speaker>
               <p>Suppose that were lawfull, what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance  is this to themselues, to see the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that bee common and knowne drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, vsurers, adulterers, and profane persons punished, for that they are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers at me, for teaching the 'trueth of religion, and reproouing sharply their godlesse conuersation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>Oh you are a simple man, it is great hinderance, for they can do nothing in  defence of you, though it be in matters wherein you and they doe agree, but it tendeth to the derogation of their own estimation, such is the contrarietie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt your building and theirs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paule</speaker>
               <p>By that meanes shall we be so weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with aduersaries, that we shal neuer  haue any hope to doe good, but euen to be constrained to giue ouer the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie.</p>

               <speaker>Paule</speaker>
               <p>So thought the Sodomites, that they

               <p>Wee woulde haue none to preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue once a moneth, and then shoulde  he doe it profoundly, and confirme his matter out of the fathers, and humane writers substantially, whereas you ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon you to preach three or foure times a week, must not onely of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie handle your matters verie rawlie, but also breede loathsomnesse in the people.</p>

               <speaker>Paule</speaker>
               <p>Surely my hart waxeth cold, and my  flesh trembleth to heare you speake so monstrously: dooth preaching consist in quoting of doctors, and alleadging of Poets and Philosophers, in what part of his commission hath a minister war rant so to do? You finde fault with our
<pb facs="tcp:20279:17"/>
often preaching, because your selues cannot so doe, but if you woulde leaue off your vaine glory, in hunting after promotion, and your couetousnesse in adding murther vnto theft, I meane li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to liuing, and betake your selues to study and praier, bending your whole indeuor to the glorie of God, and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of his people, you should see the blessing of God so aboundantly vppon you, that you shold preach foure times euery week, with more fruite than you can doe nowe foure times euery yeare, for while you bee minded as you are, the Lords iudgment is vpon your gifts, and his cursse vpon your labours, that you appeare ridiculous euen vnto chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And whereas you say often prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching cloyeth the people, you shewe your selfe plainely to haue no feeling in the sweetnes of the worde of God: for it is so delightfull vnto the childe of God, that the more he heareth and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it, the more desirous is he to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede therein, it is the propertie of the vngodly, to whome the word is foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to be cloied with the same.</p>

nowe are made Mitred Lordes, so that they cannot tel what it is to traine vp a people to the gospel, &amp; reclaime them from ignorance and sinne, for they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer stouped so lowe as to labour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but if they had euen my experience, they would sing an other song, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I came into the haruest to worke, I liked their hierarchy wel inough, but when I laid it to my labours to further them, I found that they coulde not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly stand together.</p>

very vpright, and they haue learned of late to be more pollitike than heereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: for if they speak against any thing established, they doo it so cunningly, that aduantage can not be taken against them by law?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tertullus</speaker>
               <p>Neuer doubt of that, was there euer any man that went to beat a dogge, but  he could easily finde out a staffe to doo it, you must in this case preferre your safetie before your credit, or the esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of anye that belongeth vnto you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>Yea, but shew me some particulars, for I promise you, I see not how to doo  it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tertullus</speaker>
               <p>You must be sure to let none preach at Paules crosse, but they of whom you  haue experience to like wel of you, and you must giue them instructions before hand, that they do inuey mightilie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the reformation that our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries desire, and there wil one or other of them speake against that, and so you may haue sufficient aduantage against them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>But these fellowes be very sharpe to  find a fault: What and if the matter
<pb facs="tcp:20279:24"/>
which our friend preacheth be false, &amp; so the other take occasion to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fute it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tertullus</speaker>
               <p>Then must you vrge him to defende  that which he hath said, and so shal you haue more occasion to intrap the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>But in so doing, he whome we set on  worke shall lose his credit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tertullus</speaker>
               <p>What and if he do, do you compare  his credit with the waight of your Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprickes? There is no comparison.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>You say true, but what if it shall fall  out, that the aduersarie be not blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, neither in matter nor manner?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tertullus</speaker>
               <p>If hee maintaine the controuersie it  is sufficient cause to put him to silence though he haue the better part, for you must maintain the peace of the Church.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>But this is not all, for how shall we do  for the courte, that is the place, which aboue all we must fortifie, or els we are gone?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tertullus</speaker>
               <p>Indeede there is great care to be had  of it, and there be many waies to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent vs there, but we will doo what we can in it. First you must take heed from time to time, what chaplains be put to the queene, seing they are the teachers
<pb facs="tcp:20279:25"/>
of the whole court, namelie, that they be eloquent of toong, and good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, not too precise in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>It is very true, for they may els marre all, I haue heard some of them speake  dangerouslie, euen before hir Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tertullus</speaker>
               <p>Therefore you must take heede, that  they be such as can be contented with the course of the worlde, and then if they happen to speake home nowe and then, as it is a thing incident vnto a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritian to be girding, the Courtiers will neuer regarde his words, because thee see hee walketh not according to that himselfe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>But I am afraid that the court shal in time come to knowlege by their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,  aod then we are gone.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tertullus</speaker>
               <p>Feare not that, I read once in a Book made by one nf the Puritanes, that if a  man woulde haue the blessing of God (as he termed it) vpon his hearing, hee must submit him selfe to an ordinarie teacher, which thing I promise you is somewhat: for I see, that the greatest knowledge of their religion, as in those
<pb facs="tcp:20279:25"/>
places, and men, that haue that same ordinarie teacher, and therefore keepe them from any more preaching, than one sunday in the moneth, and that by diuers men, and I warrant you that gappe is stopped for euer.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>It is something that you say, &amp; I will not forget to looke vnto it, but there  is an other thing which is greater than that, which is, how wee may keepe the Queene on our side, for I haue often feared her, seeing (there is no question) but she is grounded in the foundation of religion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tertullus</speaker>
               <p>Howe haue you kept in with her all this while? </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>Marie thus, we haue bene verie care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to take heede who be admitted to  preach before her in the Lent: There was one Deering, that by our negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence preached, if he and such as hee, hadde but continued the whole Lent, I am afraide, there would haue bene ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a lord Bishop left in England be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the next Lent had come againe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tertullus</speaker>
               <p>That I like very well, but that is not all, they wil make books, and it can not  bee but some of them doo come to hir
<pb facs="tcp:20279:26"/>
hands, how wil you do if she like wel of them, and the matter of Discipline in them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>I promise you I cannot tel, you must help vs that dead lift, or els wee are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doone. </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tertullus</speaker>
               <p>It is an easie matter to remedie, you must when you heare hir speake of such  things, make hir beleeue that all is wel, and that the drift of these men is not seene, for they would haue no magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strare, and so would pull downe Kinges and Princes, and this wil be sure to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, and make them to be esteemed the vilest men aliue.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>Howe can I tell hir that all is well, when I haue bin constrained to tell di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers  Preachers, that haue so sore vrged mee with the text, that I coulde wishe things were amended, but the Q. will not at any hand?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tertullus</speaker>
               <p>Surely, you are a very simple man (my Lorde) as though the Queene heares  what you say vnto them, or they, what you say to the Queene, you must still continue that course of excusing all things to hir, for shee beleeueth that you are learned, and lay all the blame
<pb facs="tcp:20279:26"/>
when you talke with them on hir: for you cannot ouerthrow them by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and so you shall not onelie keepe the Q on your side, but also make the Preachers haue a tollerable opinion of you, that you would haue some thinges reformed if it lay in you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>That is a notable way, I will alwaies obserue and practise that, but there be  many Noble men, Counsellers, greate courtiers that seeme to like well of our aduersaries: how shall we do to retaine them, or to bridle them that are gone from vs?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tertullus</speaker>
               <p>That will be some what hard to doo: yet the best counsell I can see meete to  be taken, is this: you must shewe your selues very affectious vnto those that desire glorie and estimation, you must winke at the vices of all of them what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they be, and not reproue them, much lesse correct them, and those of them that be needie, you must haue them to beg the Bishopprickes, Dean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es, and such great places, &amp; let them that shall haue them pay well for them. So shall you not onelie haue them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding vnto you for a benefite, but
<pb facs="tcp:20279:27"/>
keepe them still on your side, in hope to haue the like bootie an other time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doitreph</speaker>
               <p>This is very well, and shal be always  obserued: but there is yet an other thing I heard of late, that there be verie manie Gentlemen and Gentlewomen in the Court that like vs not, and it hath often times bene, that Kings and Princes haue beene induced by infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of meane menne, to doo that which great Counsellours coulde not be at into their heads, how shall we do to stay the mischiefe that may come of these?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tertullus</speaker>
               <p>Easilie, you must consider that they be of two sortes, either they be such as  be highly in fauor, or they be common courtiers: if they be of the former sort, you must when you haue oportunitie to speake to hir, tell hir, that she must take heede of such, and such persons: for though they be verie wise and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete, because you must not dislike anie that shee liketh, yet are they (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a good nature) deceiued, by the faire pretence of Puritans, &amp; for them, you must saye they doo greate harme, by reason of their countenaunce in the
<pb facs="tcp:20279:27"/>
court, with fauouring the Puritans, so that it shall come to passe, by these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations, that the Queene shall not onely reiect their speeches (if they vse any against you) but also take them vp roundly, that they shall not dare to speake any more.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>This pleaseth me at the verie heart, but how shall wee doo to be sure in the  counsell table, for they are wise, and many of them like vs but from the teeth outward, and wee haue receiued many a foile there?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tertullus</speaker>
               <p>That is euen the hardest of all: I know not in the whole world any way  but one.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>Tell me that one, for if once I know it, we wil say well to it but we wil bring  it to passe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tertullus</speaker>
               <p>This is it: in King Edwardes dayes, there were Bish. of the counsell: now if  you could get, though it were but one to be a counseller, then might hee verie well, whensoeuer any matter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint came, tel the lords it pertained to ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, and he &amp; his brethren woulde heare it at large: so might he stop their mouthes quickelie,
<pb facs="tcp:20279:28"/>
and then hee might for fashions sake heare the cause, but send the plaintifes away with a flea in their eare. And thus very quickly woulde all complaints to the counsell cease.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>Oh moste notable deuice, all our  friends in England shal faile vs, but we wil haue this take place: there is yet an other thing that must be helped, and that is the vniuersities, for they haue great priuiledges, and Puritans start vp there euery day.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tertullus</speaker>
               <p>So there will do some, doo what you  can, vnlesse you haue a fire and a fagot, which weapon of ours, you only lacke, and none but it: the best course that I knowe to be taken is this, let no Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge choose his owne head, but let him haue a <hi>Mandamus,</hi> procured from the Queene, and see that he be such a one, as hath bene a non resident before, and let him haue diuers liuings: and so that will draw with it formalitie. Let him be the Q. chaplaine, or at the least broght nowe and then to preache in the Lent, and that will so set hym a gog for a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricke, that you shall be sure he wil suppresse your aduersaries as they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise,
<pb facs="tcp:20279:28"/>
and let the heades of the houses be admonished from time to time, that they choose none to be fellows that be Puritans, but such as like the estate, and for the more assurance, let them be vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to subscribe, yea to sweare to your authoritie, before they be admitted.</p>

               <p>Shall we go by Cambridge, &amp; see this  put in execution as we go?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tertullus</speaker>
               <p>Nay soft, be sure of the court, before  you enterprise any other where, least you marre all.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne faith and sacraments, the statute law fauors them too much.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>But haue wee no helpe by the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non  law?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tertullus</speaker>
               <p>Yes, there is helpe inough in the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non  law, if they will take it: but I will tell you one thing in your eare, which I would not for a thousand pounds were knowne abroad, and that is this: if the
<pb facs="tcp:20279:29"/>
statute made in the 28. of H. oct. cap. 19 and the reuiuing of it in the 1. of Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth cap. 1. were thorowlie sifted, I am afraid, not any cannon law woulde be found good lawe in England, and so what would become of you, and your aucthoritie? But I know to whom I do speake it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>What shall we do then? </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tertullus</speaker>
               <p>You must set a good face vppon the matter, and pretend law, both statute,  and cannon, especially cannon, bicause they know not that they depriue them of their liuings, which if you (though they know you do them wrong) could remedy it by law, yet are not their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses so wel filled as yours, and so lacke of liuing will make them to yeelde at length, as we see it hath done many.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>But may we not wel suppresse them,  for not vsing the surplice, and booke of common praier in all points?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tertullus</speaker>
               <p>I tell you there is no law in England  to hurt them, for any thing that they haue done concerning the surplice, the iudges hauing beene set on by you, and vs, haue indited them for it, but it is more than they canne warrant by law,
<pb facs="tcp:20279:29"/>
and as for the booke it is cleare, that the strickt keeping of it was meant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs, but we thanke you for tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the edge to them from vs. Sumna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries must be your best helpe in this case, and looke that you practise it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diotreph</speaker>
               <p>This wil do very wel, how shal we do to keepe the Ministerie from too much  knowledge, for that must bee doone, though we pretend the contrarie?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tertullus</speaker>
               <p>Indeede it is a thing that you must looke narrowlie vnto, and therefore  take heed aboue al things, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises of prophesie come not vp again, for you know what harme they did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you in euery place where they were kept, and especiallie where men were moderators therein, that had bene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the seas, to see the practise of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at Geneua, and you must beware of the exercises that ministers haue at their meetings: for you knowe, that in Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester-shire, they furthered knowledge greatly.</p>

in the 14. Coloss. 1. to the Cor. and it is knowne, that they whome you and wee set on worke to get it forbidden, confessed since that they knewe it not, but tooke it to be foretelling of things to come, and not expounding of the scriptures.</p>

Because I might defend him in his vnlawfull calling: But I see their ing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling well inough, and if the man wyth whome I was so offended be not gone, I will talke further with him, for I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that hee meant better vnto mee than they did.</p>

               </gap>e withall, by taking away, and stopping the mouthes of their faithful teachers, and by thrusting vppon vs vnlearned, and vnsufficient menne, which neither haue wil, nor abilitie, with wholsome barking to driue away the wolfe, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ontrariwise dooth giue priuie encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement vnto the enemie, to continue in his wickednesse, whereby the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of God is assailed most daungerou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slie; and Sathan dooth not cease by all meanes possible to ouerthrowe that good worke which is begunne in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: and therefore it behooueth vs brethren to looke about vs, and not to suffer the ennemie to growe so strong against vs if by anie meanes wee may let and hinder his wicked enterprises. And now my brethren, what is to bee doone on our partes? Surely I am one of the simplest of a thousand, to giue aduise to proceede in any good course
<pb facs="tcp:20279:33"/>
in so waightie a matter. But this, in my iudgement were a good way, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueu to ioyne our selues together, so manie as feare GOD, and to frame our moste humble supplication vnto hir Highnesse, shewing vnto hir Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie the greate dammage and losse that the Churche dooth sustayne, for that they can not haue the voyces of their faithfull pastors, which haue diligently, and with great paines labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to drawe men backe from supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the false worship of God, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the true and sincere worship of his maiestie, and laying downe before vs most purely, the doctrine of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to the end, that we shoulde know what wee ought to doo, and what to leaue vndoone, leading vs, as it were, euen by the hand, to the true worship of God, and our loyall dutie vnto her Maiestie, and al hir officers. And these men (we can not tell by what meanes) are letted and stopped from dooing those notable dueties of their calling, and are not permitted to speake anie more vnto vs in the name of the Lord,
<pb facs="tcp:20279:33"/>
whereby we hir poore subiects sustaine great dearth and scarcitie euen to the foode of our soules. Therefore wee hir loyall subiects, most humbly do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate her Highnesse, that shee would looke vpon the affliction of the poore Church, and let vs haue our true tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers restored vnto vs againe. And so we hir subiects should yeelde continual thanks vnto hir highnesse, praieng vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to GOD alwayes for hir prosperitie. And (our brethren) if this way shall bee thought good, when there shal be some aduise taken vpon it. Then to choose out some fitte man that can indite and frame our supplication, one that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth God, that hath a feeling of this plague in his heart (as the Scripture speaketh) I meane of the want &amp; lacke of these good preachers.</p>
            <p>And this beeing doone, then to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point other godlie and honest men, to present our supplication, two, or three, as it shall bee thought good vnto you, and the rest to aide them with money, or in what other daunger may fall out: so that they present it in the name of
<pb facs="tcp:20279:34"/>
the whole congregation, or otherwise, if it shal be thought good: first to moue our sute vnto some of the Byshops, as Winchester or Salisburie, or both, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie other that you shall thinke good: I beseech you let vs not sit still, when wee are touched so neer, but as those good men haue ventured their libertie and liuing for our good: so let vs take some paines for them, to aduenture some daunger of reproofe, or what else may fall out.</p>
            <p>Better is the day of death (saith Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon) than the day of birth, man that is borne of a woman, liueth but a shorte time, and is replenished with many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, but happie are the dead, that die in the Lord.</p>
            <p>Man is borne of woman in trauel, to liue in miserie, man thorough Christ doth die in ioy, and liue in felicitie. Hee is borne to die, &amp; dieth to liue. Straight as he commeth into the worlde, with cries, hee vttereth his miserable estate, straight as he departeth, with songs he praiseth God for euer. Scarce yet in his cradle, three deadlie ennemies assault
<pb facs="tcp:20279:34"/>
him: after death no aduersary can anoy him: whilest hee is heere, hee displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth God: when he is dead, he fulfilleth his will. In this life, heere he dieth tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row sinne, in the life to come, he liueth in righteonsnes, thorough many tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in earth, he is still purged: with ioy vnspeakable, in heauen is he made pure for euer: heere hee dieth euerie houre, there hee lyueth continually: heere is sinne, there is righteousnesse: heere is time, there is eternitie: hecre is hatred, there is loue: heere is paine, there is pleasure: heere is miserie, there is felicitie: heere is corruption, there is immortalitie: heere we see vanitie, there shall wee beholde the maiestie of God, with triumphant and vnspeakable ioye in glorie euerlasting.</p>
            <p>Seeke therefore the things that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God the father, to whom with the sonne and the holie ghost, be al honour and glorie, worlde without ende</p>
