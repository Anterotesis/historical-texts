         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO
New-Englands pretended Chriſtians,
WHO
Contrary to CHRIST, have deſtroyed the Lives of Men.</head>
            <opener>Having ſeen ſomething of yours, called by you an Appendix, whereby you would juſtify your ſelves in Whipping, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning,
Baniſhing, Killing, and making ſpoyle of whole Families; I being weak of body, and in bed, the ſtrength of the
Lord aroſe in me, from the which was given forth that which followeth:</opener>
            <p>THE Lord God will anſwer you with that, which you ſhall never be able to reſiſt, and from the which you ſhall never be able to flie; neither ſhall
your coverings defend you, but God will viſit in ſecret, and the Almighty will rain ſnares upon you: and all your ſtrong holds in one day
(and that ſuddenly, in a moment) will the Lord God ſcatter, and confound, with all your ſtrong reaſons, and your weapons which you have
gathered together againſt the inviſible God and his ſervants, like your Fathers in the dayes of old (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 41. 21.) theſe with all your weapons
of warr againſt the Lamb, and the ſuffering ſeed, ſhall be broken in the midſt of you, and death will overtake you, and Gods righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
will enter within your dwellings, and a day of blackneſſe from the throne of God will come upon you, and his anger with bitterneſſe will
be powred forth upon you, as a mighty ſtorme which cometh on a ſudden, and as a whirlwind which none can ſtop, and as the mighty unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
raging waves of the Sea, which none is able to reſiſt; even ſo ſhall the day of your calamity come, which is haſtning, as the lightning, whoſe break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth, all your fleſhly wiſdome ſhall never be able to hinder.</p>
            <p>Behold! I have heard a voice of terror from the Lord againſt your unrighteous proceedings, and the day of Gods vengeance is in his heart,
and who ſhall ſtand to plead with him? Behold! ye thorns, the Lord our God is a conſuming fire, and before him you cannot ſtand, for
your ſins have reached up to Heaven, and your iniquities is come before the moſt high, and your grievous blood-thirſty actions is ſpread over
Nations, and Gods witneſs in thouſands (who are not of us) but rather yet againſt us, doth riſe up in their hearts againſt you; and when you are
awakened, you will be filled with anguiſh, and a cup of aſtoniſhment from the righteous God of truth, will be powred forth unto you; and as ſure
as you have thirſted after, and drunk deep of the blood of Gods choſen, (though deſpiſed of men) ſo certain ſhall you have blood to drink; and
trembling, horror, and amazement, will moſt abſolutely come in that day, which approacheth as a theif in the night; and then ſhall your bowels
be ripped open, and your inſide-coverings broken, and then ſhall your heartes be rent with perplexity, and amazement ſhall come over you as
the cloud of the night, and the hand of the Almighty will find out your ſecreet lurking places, and then ſhall ye know that the Lord our God
doth, and will plead the cauſe of his people, and avenge himſelf on his and their enemies; and then ſhall ye know that ye have riſen up againſt
the Lamb, who is ſometimes ſilent from pleading his own cauſe, who though dumb as to anſwer the mighty one of the earth, yet faithful in ſuffering, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the will of him who ruleth over all: and then ſhall ye know, that though no anſwer at all were written unto your dark pretended co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings,
yet ſhall you then feel an anſwer neer unto you, and the ſound of Gods terrible voice ſhall be heard in the midſt of you; and from the
dreadful noiſe of his warr, ſhall you never be able to cover your ſelves withal your writings, printings, nor declarations, though never ſo ſtrong
from the prudency of the earth, for God hath caſt all that behind his back; and in the day at hand ſhall you moſt abſolutely come to know it
ſo to be.</p>
            <p>For behold, my heart is indeed rent, and God hath opened in it the ſecret council of his will, and his purpoſe concerning you, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
ſhall never be changed, which is ſealed againſt the evill doer; And where is there a people or evil doer, who have done worſe than you?
Have you not made your ſelves a reproach amongſt men, and as a by-word amongſt the people? O horrible, and wicked cruelty, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs
tyranny which is found in the midſt of you? Is this the fruit of your profeſſion? and has the ſpirit of truth led you to do theſe things?
Do not even the Nations ſtand and look at you? and do not the upright in heart mourn in ſecret becauſe of your ſins? Ah, who could have
believed that you would have done ſuch things! and do you think now to ſtop the mouths of people by publiſhing your ſtrong reaſons? Nay,
this is plain in my heart, that all whatſoever you print, publiſh, or declare, ſhall never give ſatisfaction to the meek juſt principle of God,
which remains in the ſpirits of many thouſand thouſands in the Nations round about you: and if your called an <hi>Appendix,</hi> with the reſt of your
writings, were never anſwered by us, and if we therein ſhould lay our mouths in the duſt for ever; yet this we know, that the holy one of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
the righteous God of truth will plead our cauſe, and execute Judgement in his fury, and avenge the blood of his Saints, and helpe the man of low
degree againſt him who is too ſtrong for him; and to the Lord God of righteouſneſſe we commit our cauſe, and the innocency of our dear bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and in Gods bleſſed will I reſt, and am ſatisfied in reſpect of his love unto his Jewels, though but as fools to the world, and in reſpect of
his anſwering of you according to the fruit of your own wayes.</p>
            <p>And behold! ye children of men, I cannot but proceed to declare unto you the day which is near at hand, and warn you all to ſtrip your
ſelves from all your coverings, and ſit down ye people in duſt and aſhes, and confeſſe your Iniquities in ſecret unto the Lord, before it be too
late, for great is the woe which is coming upon you; and that which I have heard concerning you, is none other than a voice of terror; O the
trouble, diſtreſſe and calamity, that ſoundeth in mine heart concerning you! and from the Lord God will it be powred forth, and exceeding
deep ſhall you drink thereof; and this ſhall you know to be true, when the whirlwind cometh from far, and the ſhadows of the night draw near,
when no hiding place will be found for the hypocrite, neither a refuge for the evill doer.</p>
            <p>And then, as ye have not ſpared the deſpiſed of the world; ſo will the Lord caſt upon you and not ſpare. O the bitterneſs, and unutterable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which will then come! but who amongſt you will believe theſe things, and who can entertain the Council of the Lord? and are not your
hearts yet hardned againſt reproof? and are you not to be reproved for your envy againſt Gods people? nay moreover, are you not ſometimes
already reproved by him, who ſeeth in ſecret, and who ſearcheth the intents of the heart, and maketh manifeſt unto man the wicked enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes
thereof, and overturneth the councils of the wicked, but remembreth the cauſe of the needy, and pleadeth the Innocency of the upright,
in whoſe ſight the death of the Saints is pretious, and who pleadeth their cauſe in the day of trouble, and will moſt certainly confound his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
and ſcatter his enemies as ſmoak is ſcattered with a mighty whirlwind, and in that day where then will your place be found?</p>
            <p>And a ſeed there is which God will deliver from your hands, and preſerve from the blood-thirſty men, which ſhall grow up in the midſt of you
as a Lilly among thorns, and Gods bleſſing ſhall be upon them, with whom my life is: and as the latter gleaning in the time of harveſt, ſo ſhall the
gathering of Gods heritage be. And what you have done, will be for the advantage of the ſuffering ſeed, and for the Glory of God, and much
for your diſadvantage and eternal ſhame, and endleſs miſery, if you repent not. And this you men of ſin ſhould know, that in as much as
you have taken away the life of Gods creatures; and moreover, unjuſtly, by an unrighteous law deſtroyed the life of his ſervants; therein may
all men ſee that you are contrary to Chriſt, and led by a ſpirit oppoſite to him, who came not to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them.</p>
            <p>And what is here written, need not hinder the movings of God in any of my Brethren his ſervants, in giving forth a more large Anſwer,
according to the particulars written in your called <hi>Appendix,</hi> or to any other of your writings, the which you may alſo expect; only this was in
my heart, in which I have diſcharged my Conſcience; and ſo herein give forth my mite amongſt the reſt of my Brethren, by way of declaration,
and that from God.</p>
            <p>And by this it is my ſouls deſire your hearts may be humbled, and truly rent, and broken for your own iniquities, and that with ſpeed, or
otherwiſe Gods dreadful hand you cannot eſcape.</p>
