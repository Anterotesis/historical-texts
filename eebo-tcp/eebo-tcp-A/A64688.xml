            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Who as hee testifies of himselfe in the 12. os Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> that hee came not to judge the world, but to condemne the world. And yet he that was the Saviour of the World meanes to save none without faith and repentance, and therefore he telles us; <hi>That except we repent, we shall all likewise perish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The occasion of the words was from a matter that was told unto him, a storie that men told as a thing that no way apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unto them. <hi>Pilate</hi> he had mingled the blood of the <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> with their sacrifices: now ths <hi>Pharisees</hi> they heard of it, and this they tell as newes to our Saviour Christ, as if it had no way touched them, and so our Saviour seeing they tooke not the matter as to themselves for examples unto them tells them that whatsoever Iudgements they did see executed upon others, the very selfe same thing would bee to them, if they did not repent.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>To apply it unto our selvee:</head>
               <p>It is the case of our neighbour nation, what are they greater sinners then we, I tell you nay, the very same Iudgements that fall upon them shall fall upon you vnlesse you prevent it by timely repentance. These judgements are sent as examples and instructions unto us. Those that fell with their carkasses in the
<pb facs="tcp:62136:3"/>
wildernesse are examples unto us that wee might not run unto the same excesse of riot. The Lord might have made you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples unto <hi>Ireland,</hi> as well as he hath made <hi>Ireland</hi> an example unto you. As the Lord saith in the Prophesie of <hi>Hosea</hi> 4. 11. I have overthrowne some of you as God did overthrow <hi>Sodom</hi> &amp; <hi>Gomorah,</hi> &amp; ye are as a firebrand snatcht out of the burning, &amp; yet you returned not. God hath overthrowne that land espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the best of the land, according as he did to <hi>Germanie;</hi> And now he is come neerer to us; The miseries &amp; calamities which they indure were too tedious to relate.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Et animus reminiscere horret luctusque refugit.</head>
               <p>And as if God did intend yet to shew us his judgements more neere to us: the fire breakes out in that corner of the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that wee least feared, which should cause us to repent in Sackcloath and ashes; Wee know it is the case of our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne that we should take this to heart: We know that <hi>David</hi> when the judgements of God was upon him in his child, then he fasted and humbled his soule with fasting; yea and is hee did when affections were upon others of his Brethren, that were no great friends unto him. Wee see it also in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> that he hearing such newes as we now heare from <hi>Ireland, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> asked how his brethren the children of <hi>Israell</hi> were, as he was told that they were in great afflicton.</p>
               <p>This was the newes, how doth he take it. And it came to passe when I heard these words I sate downe and wept and mourned, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven. This is the sence that all the members of the body should have one of another. They should call upon God one for another. God makes this an example unto us, that if we doe not repent, the same judgement or a greater shall fall upon us.</p>
               <p>The thing which we are to doe is to repent; The Physitian he tells us the danger that we are in, if we do not repent, &amp; he gives us a proviso that if will take this course notwithstanding the evill that is against us, he will forgive us if we do repent.</p>
               <p>And here we will see first, the danger we are in.</p>
               <p>The danger is perishing, either repent or there is no possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb facs="tcp:62136:3"/>
of salvation, noe prevention of Gods judgements in this world, nor in the world to come without repentance; thinke not that these words are in vaine, thinke not that these wordes are spoken in vaine, T'is not a bare and cold profession of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that shall save you, if you do not repent you shall perish, and be destroyed.</p>
               <p>Beloved, wee must Consider with our selves, that God is mercyfull when he will pardon a sinner. But when he intends to leave them, he is not mercyfull if they do not repent: And thou deceivest thy selfe, and makest an Idoll of thy God, if thou thinke that he is so made up of mercy, that he hath forgotten to be just. The Lord will breake the hairie scalpe of them that commit iniquity.</p>
               <p>Say not I shall be delivered, notwithstanding I goe on in these courses, the Lord will not have mercy upon that man. A man that goes on in iniquity, the Lord will not have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such an one, his mercy appeares to them that are weary of their sinnes, and come unto him, what is it that makes the sin of the Holy Ghost so terrible as it is there described. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 6. It is impossible.</p>
               <p>If they shall fall away to renew them againe unto repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; That's the deadly sinne, the sinne against the Holy Ghost. But what what is it I aske thee, that makes this sinne so deadlie? why because he that commits this sinne is not renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by repentance; If he were renewed by repentance, this sinne against the Holy Ghost should be forgiven him, doe not thinke that the sinne of man is above the mercy of God, do not thinke that any sin that mortall man can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, shall out-vie the blood of Christ, the sin against the Holy Ghost should not be deadly, except the point lie in this, hee cannot be renewed by repentance, so that if thou be not renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by repentance, thou art in the state of him that is guilty of the sinne against the Holy Ghost, of one miserable and irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable, many thinges I have to speake, but I see that my time is but short, and therefore I must be briefe.</p>
               <p>You see the first thing, the danger is inevitable, no way to
<pb facs="tcp:62136:4"/>
scape it but if we repent, the Lord will repent of the iudgement against us, but if we repent not, there is no hope to escape ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this world, or in the world to come; But I come to the duty of the day.</p>
               <p>For the worke of this day fasting is nothing but the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward way, yet it is the onely way to repentance, do not thinke that you come to heare an ordinary Sermon God expects it at thy hands, that thou shouldst examine what thou hast heard, whatsoever thou hast heard this day, out of this place of thy duty, the Lord lookes thou shouldest do it speedily, <hi>Now is the Axe laid to the root of the tree, and therefore every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit shall be hewen downe and cast into the fire.</hi> Now, why not before? now that is now the preaching of the Gospell comes to you, now the Lord exhorts you by the danger, now he shewes you the way how to repent, and to escape the wrath that is to come. Now if you doe not repent, Gods sword is drawn, <hi>the Axe is laid to the root of the tree, and God wil cut you down.</hi> Now the Lord he threatneth you, these thinges only that you might repent. Therefore as God saith in <hi>Hosea;</hi> I will do thus. How? I will do to you, as I have done to them in <hi>Ireland.</hi> I will do to you, as I have done to <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi> And because I will doe thus unto thee, prepare to meete thy God oh <hi>Israell,</hi> I am ready to strike, and that I may not strike thee, Prepare to meete thy God. Those men that are our enemies they strike be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they give us warning, but saith God, therefore I will doe thus unto thee, and because I will do thus, do thou meete me with repentance, <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. <hi>ver.</hi> 12. Except you returne the Lord is preparing of his arrowes. <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. <hi>ver.</hi> 12. Why doth he not shoot, presently he must bend his bow, and draw out his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and tell you of it that you may remember.</p>
               <p>Remember this now, now that God cals you all to repentance, now if you neglect the practise of it, the Axe is laid to the root of the tree.</p>
               <p>But now to come to the point of the act of repentance, I will not stand much to shew you what repentance is, but to shew you what you are to do. As you must not come before the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:62136:4"/>
and say, Lord we repent us of our sins, and mocke God, never intending it, never doe it upon the perill of his indignation, of his wrath that shall burne against you in the world to come. Know that these are not vaine words, for Repentance; there are two parts of it, and the Lord doth expect that both should bee performed by us.</p>
               <p>Wee read in the Scripture of repentance for sinne, and we read of repentance from sinne.</p>
               <p>So the Apostle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> saith thus; least my God should humble me before you; for there are many that repent not of their abhomination. and <hi>Acts.</hi> 8. 22. <hi>Repent therefore of this thy wickednesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Repentance hath two lookes like <hi>Ianus</hi> with two faces it lookes backward, and it lookes forward, when it lookes back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it lookes upon the thing that is done, and because that is done, cannot be undone, therefore it weeps, and wailes, and greives, that thing is done to Gods dishonour, which cannot be undone, that is repentance when a man looks upon sin, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himselfe, and is sorrowfull for what is past, thats but the first part of repentance.</p>
               <p>The second is that, that lookes upon sinne with distast, it is abhominable unto him: It is not hereafter I will not sweare, I will not be light &amp; wanton, I will not be evill, but there must be an hatred of all sinne, you that love the Lord hate evill; there must not be onely a ceasing from the Act of sinne, but there must be a reformation of the will, and of the heart, to the utter obhorring to the utter hating of sinne.</p>
               <p>Concerning the former of these, Repentance when it looks upon sinne that is past, the sinnes that I have committed that many have not regarded for the fornications that you have committed, you must understand that here the worke of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting is humiliation. But (marke it) not an humiliation wherein a man is meere passive, or is humbled by some great affliction that is fallen upon him. The judgement of God may come to a man, the stoutest man and humble him, but that is not an humiliation of Repentance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:62136:5"/>
The humiliation which Repentance brings it is an <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

The Spirit of God maketh use of nature, not as Agent but as a sujbect wherein grace is; and if there were not this the spirit could worke without it.</p>
               <p>It is said of our Saviour Christ in the case of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> when he groaned he was troubled, if you doe observe the reading in the Margent, it is, <hi>And Iesus troubled himselfe, Luke</hi> 15. And so in in his other sufferings, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>He offered himselfe;</hi> so that this humiliation must bee in obedience. Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, and he will raise you up so that the Humilitation, it must bee a voluntary worke, having its originall from Gods spirit, That seing there is no other remedy in the world, to shew thy hating of it; thou wilt take an holy revenge, thou wilt breake that stony heart of thine, and thou wilt not suffer it to be obdurate against the Lord, but howsoever God never doth this against a mans will. Heeris the point, the humilitation which the sinner hath, it is an act of his will; Hee doth not onely suffer as those that are strucke by the hand of God, so <hi>Iudas</hi> might have repented, but that comes out of a kind heart to Almighty God, that it breaks the heart. <note place="margin">Obiection</note>

               </p>
               <p>Humilitation stands in a generall processe, which we make against our selves. If we will judge our selves, we shall not be judged by him, so that this Humiliation is a Iudiciall processe
<pb facs="tcp:62136:5"/>
against our selves, wee will make our hearts throb, wee will make our eyes flow forth into teares, when Wee looke backe upon our sinnes committed. This is the Humilitation of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent sinner; so in this case a man comes to summe up all the powers and faculties of his soule, the will, the understandng, the conscience, the sence, it will require all thy power, and all thy strength to doe it. Thy memory that must draw up the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture, thou must consider that God will open all when hee comes to judge thee; Thou swearest, thou hast forgotten it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, but God hath written it in a booke; thy conscience shall remember every oath that thou hast sworne, every idle word that thou hast spoke, you see God. <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. Saith; He will set all our sins in order before us, he will rub up this dull memory of ours, we must draw unto our remembrance the multitude of the sinnes that we have committed against God. It is the speech of the Prophet <hi>Esah,</hi> call to your remembrance the sins that you have committed; and if you would rubbe up your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, and doe as stewards that have a bad memory, make it their businesse to cast and account every night, what they lay out the day before: and so if wee would every day before wee go to bed call our selves to an account, how we have spent that day, our memories should not be so short, wee must know how to set sinne before the sight of Almighty God, Briefely thus.</p>
               <p>Looke first in thy owne debt, a debt that thou didst com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit before thou wast born, begin at the highest, what was that? Doe not you know that many men have beene arrested, and undone for debts, for which as we say they did never drinke; a debt may be owing by the sonne for his Father, after that his father is dead, thou art in the loynes of <hi>Adam,</hi> if <hi>Adam</hi> had stood, thou shouldest have stood, bring he is falne, thou fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest with him: we all hange upon <hi>Adam</hi> as the stringe that the Prophet speaks of; that as a bunch of keyes hung upon a string, when that the string is broken, then all the keyes fall downe, with him we all hang, and with him we all fall; the sinne acted by <hi>Adams</hi> justice imputed unto thee as thou art in his loynes.</p>
               <p>Againe in the second place, by reason of this imputation of
<pb facs="tcp:62136:6"/>
                  <hi>Adams</hi> sinne unto thee, thou art deprived of that image in which Thou and Hee were created; assoone as ever <hi>Adam</hi> acted the sinne, presently <hi>Adam</hi> was spoiled; His understanding was darkned, his will was rebellious, his conscience was disordered, only heere was the difference, <hi>Adam</hi> was despoyled of it, after he had continued long in the world, thou assoone as ever soule and body were conjoyned together, God considers thee in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> to have reached forth thy hand to the forbidden fruit, and therefore the same thing that befell <hi>Adam,</hi> that he was spoyled of his originall righteousnesse, the same befals thee, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David</hi> in the 51. <hi>Psal.</hi> Hee was guilty of murther, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery yet for all this hee saith, he was borne in sinne, and doe you not thinke he did it to extenuate his sin and iniquity, that he was borne in sinne, and concelved in it, as if a man should doe me harme, because it was naturall unto him, hee could not abide me, should not I thinke him the more wicked, so the sins against God are very haynous; the root from whence this adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie proceeded, and this murther came, it came from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of his ill nature.</p>
               <p>As we deale with Toades and Foxes and Vermine, wee kill and destroy them, when they doe no hurt, wee thinke they may doe ill, because the nature of them is to doe harme; so God he findes us such Toades, such things, even before wee are out of the shell, and therefore God may justly deale with us so: so that God may take a young Child and cast it into Hell as soone as it is borne. If God will doe this for the first sinne, Death went over them that did not sinne after the simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of the transgression of <hi>Adam.</hi> Death went over those that committed no naturall sinne, as <hi>Adam</hi> did. Consider this, that when we were first borne by reason of the seede o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion that is in us, if God had marked us assoone as we came out of the wombe, he might justly have committed us to Hell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the vanitie of your childhood.

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how in its rife in a child before you thinke it hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. Consider that which comes from Pride, froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb facs="tcp:62136:6"/>
wrangling, and wantonnesse. Looke afterwards when thou commest to thy riper age, when thou wast married, when thou wast without governement. Divide thy life into severall parts, all these things may serve to set before us, those sinnes that wee have committed, not hiding them, not concealing them with <hi>Adam.</hi> To play the part of the Kings Attorney not only to bring an evidence of the fact, but to shew how hainous and grievous it is. And beloved, when this hath beene done both in sinnes of commission and (which will breake any ones heart to thinke) of the sinnes of omission; the innumerable good things which God hath commanded me to doe, yet I have neglected them, nay rather there proceedes words that arc so farre from tending to edification, that they are corrupt words, as the Apostle speakes; this I told unto you, Thus you must doe, the more of those sinnes you put before you, the more incited you should shew your selves: My sinnes are more then the haires of my head, and in another place, my sinnes are a burrhen too heavie for me to beare: so that this is the part of a penitent sinner, to set his sinnes before him, and then to desire God to forgive his secret sinnes, so draw them before thy heart, before Almighty God, and condemne them, and then God will not condemne thee; when wee have done thus, this appertaines to the first part wherein I indite my selfe, these and these things I have done, these and these things God hath committed to me, I have received much grace of God in vaine; I have abused my Talent and hid it in a napkin; these be for the Inditement.</p>
               <p>But then wee must come to the triall, when my memorie hath brought them to me, and when my understanding hath considered them and weighed them in the ballance of the sanctuary, and I consider that they are sinnes to be aggraated not onely by the Law but by the Gospel, then my confience presently like a peece overcharged recoyles me backward, and I consider the weight of them that they are a burthen to heavie for me to beare. Then the soule strikes the heart, this is my case; considering what the law hath said, considering what the
<pb facs="tcp:62136:7"/>
Gospel hath said: Alasse if I had not commited these sinnes while I was under grace, under the Minister of the Gospel, when Christ invited me to come unto him; when he bids me cast this burthen upon his shoulders, and hee would ease me, I will not doe it, and though that hee comes with peace and with safetie we will not receive him; as you heard in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; set before you the representation of the true Crucifix. The lambe of God that was slaine in the law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He that offered him was to lay his hand upon the head of the Lambe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse his sinnes over him, and then the Lambe was slaine. Now consider this, my swearing &amp; my lying &amp; my vanity, my pride in apparrell, and all my sinnes, <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll are laid upon the Lambs head that was never guilty of these vanities, the Lambe of God, hee was slaine though thou canst not groane for thy sinnes, thou canst not weepe for thy sinnes Looke, then looke upon Christ, he sought God with strange cryes and teares, not in regard of the punishment, though thou diddest not cry for thy sinnes, he had strong cryes and teares. <hi>Phil</hi> 5. And observe the highest crie. <hi>My God, my God why hast thou forsaken me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You that thinke sinne to be so small a matter, consider your sinne as it lay upon Christ, strong cryes you see it cost him. Consider him lying graveling upon the ground, as it were pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for life, sweating blood before his Father; crying, <hi>Father if it be possible take this cup from me:</hi> As if hee should say, if hou wilt shew onely mercie passe by thy judgement all this time; with cryes and with strong teares, and the third time cryes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Crosse, <hi>My God, my God why hast thou forsaken me.</hi> When all the earth had a blacke Mantle cast over it, &amp; darkenesse over him that was the light of the World, and as great a darkenesse in him, his soule was darkened within him. To consider these things is able to breake the heart of any man that hath the lest sparke of grace in him.</p>
               <p>But then consider with thy selfe thus; What hath sin done to me? First, it hath defiled thee, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. He wishes us that wee would keepe our selves from all defilement of body and spirit. That which goes into the mouth of a man defiles not
<pb facs="tcp:62136:7"/>
a man, but that which goes out, for, from within, even out o the heart of man proceedeth evill thoughts. <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 21. 22. <hi>Adulterie, Fornications, Murthers, Theft, Covetuousnesse, Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, Deceit, Vncleannesse, a wicked eye, backbiting, pride, foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no sinne that thou committest but it bespots thy soule. Did you but see the soule of a sinner what dishonour and slaine brings to it, it is like a filthy spot in pure white Lawne; your sinnes they have made a separation between you and your God. They are now in a state of enmitie, (saith God) my soule doth loathe them, and their soule doth loath me. There is an utter s<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ll wee bee renewed by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, still where God comes out the Devill comes in. A man is so possest that for his life he hath not the power to resist the least temptation of the Devill, but as fast as he tempts he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitts sinne, and then comes Gods Iudgement: you have it in <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. your sins are a breach of covenant with Almighty God, &amp; do you think that Covenant breakers, breakers of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant shall scape. They are put amongst the blacke guard in the first of the <hi>Romans,</hi> Adulterers, swearers, truce-breakers, I will send among you plagues, the judgements that are not written in this booke: Why saith <hi>Turtullian, Scipturae plenitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem habent,</hi> The Scriptures have a fulnesse, I have seene an end of all perfection, but thy commandements are exceeding large. And yet there are unwritten judgements. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is perfect, it doth not containe all the judgements which God will send upon sinners.</p>
               <p>And hence, from the consideration of this comes loathing of a mans selfe, and a godly sorrow, these are the affections we should have, when we have produced our faults, and the law hath shewne the miserie we are liable to by the committing of
<pb facs="tcp:62136:8"/>
them, then a man come to abhorre himselfe as <hi>Iob</hi> saith. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I repent and obhorre my selfe in dust and ashes: you see this abhorring a mans selfe it is a concomitant of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Those that be in the darke, though they be naked, they are not ashamed: why? because they see no light, but when the light of Gods Spirit hath discovered to a man his foulenes and his shame, then they doe repent and abhorre themselves, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 26. God exhorts them that they should loath themselves as a signe of repentance. Shame you know it is a part of the judgement against sin, for <hi>Daniel</hi> the last chapter and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verse, <hi>Some shall rise to shame and to everlasting contempt.</hi> Now when we come to judge ourselves that we be not judged of God, we must bring ourselves to this shame. And as <hi>Ezra</hi> when hee came by fasting and repentance to God, hee saith, I am ashamed to come before thee, not for his owne sinnes, but for those among whom he was: The best fruit that thou canst reape of sinne, though it be repented is shame. The Prophet <hi>Zephaniah</hi> saith, the wicked know no shame. <hi>Ier.</hi> 6. 15. were they ashamed when they had done these things, they were not ashamed, neither could they blush, when thou hast done these things and considerest them, art thou ashamed of them. When thou considerest of them betweene God and thy owne conscience dost thou blush? You that were not ashamed to commit the sinne, now that God hath opened your eyes, see whether you can blush, and be ashamed before Almighty God for committing these sinnes.</p>
               <p>But then there is sorrow which is the last thing, which sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row must be true, and from the heart; the inward sorrow it is contrition, it is the rending and breaking of the heart, when a man is ready to teare himselfe in peeces, because that he hath offended so gracious a God, that hath done so much for us. This is that which the Apostles calls that same sorrow which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God, 1. <hi>Iam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All Israell wept before the Lord, suppose there were no Hell, no damnation, no outward judgement, yet as long as there is a God in Heaven, I cannot but be sorrow for my sinne
<pb facs="tcp:62136:8"/>
and when thou canst doe thus, it is an argument thou art a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent sinner, and this is done by fasting and weeping, fasting and weeping they are things that are joyned together. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 6. It is said that when the <hi>Philistims</hi> came against them, they fasted and powred down water by the Lord, that is they made or wept such abundance of teares, as if water had beene pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red downe, and so <hi>Iudg.</hi> 2. 4. When the Angell came to <hi>Bochim</hi> and told the people of their sins, the people lift up their voice and wept.</p>
               <p>Beloved, Beloved doe not our dry eyes this day testifie that we have little sorrow, remember that place in <hi>Zachary,</hi> they shall looke upon him whom they have pierced. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. And they shall lament for him, as one mourneth for his onely Son, and be sorry for him, as one is sorry for his first borne.</p>
               <p>Doft thou weepe for thy son, and not for crucifying of thy Saviour; It is not set downe that sorrow shall be in them, but they shall bee sorrow, to shew the greatnesse of it, as though they were steeped and soaked in it, and such a sorrow as was in the valley of <hi>Megiddo,</hi> when <hi>Iosiah</hi> died, in memory or which <hi>Ieremiah</hi> wrote his booke of Lamentations. And they shall sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row apart, to shew that it is a part; that sorrow which is a part, it is particularly every man, it was not the <hi>Iewes</hi> speares or sins that did crucifie Christ but thy sins.</p>
               <p>Beloved, I must speake now concerning the matter of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, and (beloved) it must be fasting, not such a superficiall fasting, as we commonly use, but fasting of another nature; we doe not understand the name of it, if you compare, <hi>Luk.</hi> 5. 33. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 14.

Thou shalt not think thy owne thoughts, speake thine on words, nor doe thy owne Actions. The Prophet doth there speak of the Sabboth which was on the tenth day of the seventh Moneth, not of the Heb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domate weekly Sabboth, the saturday, but of the universary Sabboth; and the beginning of the Chapter runneth that way. Wee have fasted, and thou hast not looked upon us, that fasting day wherein (as some report) <hi>Adam</hi> fell they should not doe any thing,: This was but the shall of fasting, all outward things that can give content to the outward man must be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided; so farre as necessity will brooke it; But I see the time is past, thus much therefore shall serve for this time.</p>
