         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <opener>Christian Reader,</opener>
            <p>THE following Narrative was writ in a Letter seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Months ago from <hi>Scotland,</hi> by a Person of great
Moderation and Integrity, well acquainted with the
Humour and Constitution of <hi>Scotland;</hi> it has been
read and approved by Persons of the best Quality both in the
Church and State i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>England,</hi> and is now at their desire pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,
because it represents shortly and impartially, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Methods under which the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> suffered
since the late Revolution; That thereby all good Christians,
especially the most charitable church of <hi>England,</hi> may <hi>See</hi> the
sad Effects of Rampant Presbytery, <hi>Pity</hi> their Brethren that
have so severely smarted under it, <hi>Consider</hi> the fatal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
of Papal Supremacy in a Protestant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irk, and
speedily <hi>bethink</hi> themselves how to quench those Flames in
their Neighbours House, which so visibly threaten Destruction
to their own.</p>
            <q>Foelix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum.</q>
            <p>Some say, and I hope it's true, that there are many Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Presbyterians to be found abroad in the World, altho with
us they have been all ever bent to Persecute when they had
Power, and think they do God good Service when they Murther
<pb facs="tcp:41758:3"/>
Bishops, and quite raze out their Adherents in Church
and State, as is too visible by the late and present Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of that Party amongst us. Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> now Bishop
of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> in a Sermon at the Election of my Lord Mayor of
<hi>London</hi> on the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> observes very well. <hi>Some
Plead now</hi> (says he) <hi>for Moderation, tho they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
it shamefully where they have Power, as the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
now in</hi> New-England, <hi>impose under the pains of
Banishment and Death in case of return, not only the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of the State, but many speculative Points in Opinion,
and other things that are certainly indifferent. The Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery
in</hi> Scotland <hi>imposed the Covenant under the pains
of Excommunication; upon which followed a Forfeiture of
the Personal Estate, and a Sequestration of the Real;</hi> he
might have added, and sometimes Death or Banishment to the
Person, but he goes on, and this <hi>Covenant all Persons, Men
and Women,</hi> (he might have said, Children too) <hi>were forced
to Swear, tho few could understand it; and one Particular
was not far from an Inquisition,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Fourth Article of Covenant.</note> 
               <hi>that every one should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
all Malignants and Enemies to their Cause, in order to
bring them to condign Punishment, by which every Man
was Sworn to be a Spy and an Informer.</hi> The following Book
shews in part what Gospel like Methods that Party now use to
have the same Principles and Practices again revived in the
World, and from it I wish these Moderate Presbyterians
which they say are abroad, to beware of that Poison that has
made the Brains of their Scots Brethren so Giddy, that their
Zeal against Episcopacy may not run them quite out of their
Christianity, as it's too palpable with us it hath done to many.</p>
            <p>Any Moderate Man will certainly think the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
our Scots Episcopacy and Presbytery not worth the
Heat or Danger of a Dispute, For <hi>First</hi> as to the <hi>Doctrine,</hi>
both Parties are agreed, the Confession of Faith made
by Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> and ratified in Parliament by King <hi>James VI.</hi>
and revived again in the Test Act by King <hi>Charles II.</hi> this,
<pb facs="tcp:41758:3"/>
together with the <hi>Westminster</hi> Confession, (both agreed on by
the General Assembly of Presbyters) are owned next to the
Word of God by both Parties, as the Standard of the Doctrine
of our Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the <hi>Worship,</hi> it's exactly the same both
in the Church and Conventicle; in the Church there are no
Ceremonies at all injoyned or practised, only some Persons
more reverent, think fit to be uncovered, which our Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians
do but by halves even in the time of Prayer; we have
no Liturgy nor Form of Prayer, no not in the Cathedrals, the
only difference in this Point is, our Clergy are not so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bold
nor fulsome in their extemporary Expressions as the others
are, nor use so many vain Repetitions, and we generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
one of our Prayers with that which our Saviour taught
and commanded, which the other Party decry as Superstitious
and Formal; Amen too gives great Offence, tho neither the
Clerk nor People use it, only the Minister sometimes shuts up his
Prayer with it. The Sacraments are Administered after the
same Way and Manner by both; neither so much as kneeling at
the Prayers, or when they receive the Elements of the Lords
Supper, but all sitting together at a long Table in the Body of
the Church or Chancel. In Baptism neither Party use the Cross,
nor are any Godfathers or Godmothers required, the Father only
promising for his Child: The only Difference in this Sacrament
is, the Presbyterians make the Father Swear to breed up his
Child in the Faith and Belief of the <hi>Covenant or Solemn
League,</hi> whereas the Orthodox cause the Father repeat the
Apostles Creed, and promise to breed up the Child in that
Faith which himself then professes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to the Discipline it's exactly in our Episcopal
Church (if it may be so called) according to the Model of the
Presbyterian Mother Kirk at <hi>Geneva,</hi> for conformable to the
Consistory direction, (not Rubrick, for that's a Superstitious word)
we have in every Parish a little Court which we call the <hi>Kirk-Session,</hi>
composed of the Minister or Ministers, if there be two
<pb facs="tcp:41758:4"/>
belonging to that Church; and some Lay men which we call
Elders and <hi>Deacons</hi> too forsooth; the business of this Court, is
to enquire into and punish Scandals, and to collect and distribute
the Money which good People are pleased daily to offer at the
Church-doors for the Poor: This Court or <hi>Session</hi> is lyable to
the Inspection and Iurisdiction of the Presbytery, who may visit
the Sessions, inspect their Records, and receive Appeals from
them upon occasion. <hi>By Presbytery</hi> we mean again a Court of
Presbyters inferior to the Synod, for every <hi>Synod</hi> or Meeting
of the whole Diocies belonging to a Bishop, is divided into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Classes or Presbyteries, in each Presbytery there is about
eighteen or twenty in some twenty four Ministers, who with the
consent of the Bishop, chose their own Moderator or President,
they meet ordinarily once every Month, or oftener if they think
their Affairs require, for they have power to adjourn and meet
at their own Discretion: As the Sessions are subject to the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries,
so are the Presbyteries to the Synod; which meets
always at set times twice every Year, there the Bishop himself
pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ides, or in case of his necessary absence, one commissionated
by him, and all things are carried by the Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rality of Votes, and
the Acts made that way, are the only Canons or Rules we use for
Discipline: As the Presbyteries are subject to the <hi>Synod,</hi> so the
whole Synods of the Nation are to the General Assembly, where
by Law the Archbishop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> is always to pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ide; and
if I be not mistaken, has a negative Voice, tho he was never known
to use it.</p>
            <p>Now I leave the impartial World to judge, whether Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians
that had any Moderation, would not be well contented,
and live quietly under such a moderate Episcopacy, where indeed
except the Power of Ordination (which is always to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
with the consent and assistance if the Brethren of the
Presbytery) and the Title of Lord, which the King is pleased
to confer upon them, the Bishops are truly but Constant Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators,
which the Presbyterians themselves, because of the great
Divisions, which often happened among them at the electing of
Moderators, were at length necessitated to sit down with. Now
<pb facs="tcp:41758:4"/>
then let any moderate Presbyterian abroad say, whether indeed
it be matter of Conscience or Humour, that makes Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
with us, separate from a Church so Constitute, or whether
the difference between our Church and their Kirk be such as
can justisie Men in raising so many publick Rebellions, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so much Misery and Confusion upon the Nation and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as our Zealots have often done; and whether their own
Consciences can plead Not Guilty at the last Great Tribunal,
where they must answer for all those Murthers and Butcheries,
all the Cries and Tears of Widows and Orphans and ruined
Families which will then testifie against them? Or what can
they answer now to the World, for the many late Barbarities
they have committed against their Protestant Brethren, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
knowing not for what; and therefore being ashamed of
their Practices, they are fain to conceal and deny them abroad:
But to prevent their endeavours that way, and that they may
appear to the World in their true colours, I have here, for the
proof of this Modest and Impartial Narrative, inserted some
few Particulars of the Sufferings of our present Episc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pal Clergy,
attested by their own Hands, and by the Hands of Gentlemen of
great Integrity, who were Eye-witnesses to the Proceedings,
many other of this Parties more cruel Practices against the
Clergy, might and may hereafter be published, and attested by
the Hands of the most significant Gentry in the several Parishes
where the Ministers were persecuted, only here these are singled
out now, because all these Papers, as they are attested and
here published, were shewed in the original authentick Copies
to most of our Governours, both in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England;</hi>
and the greatest part of them sent by a particular Commissioner
to King <hi>William</hi> then Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in the beginning of
our Troubles. The publick <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Proclamations</hi> are also
added, that Men may not be deceived by thinking, as some
would represent it, that the Persecution proceeded only from
the Rabble, and that in a Iumble of the Times, when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
was not in a condition to protect the Leiges; and by
<pb facs="tcp:41758:5"/>
the fourth Collection of Papers I think it's plain, that the most
fatal Blows were all given by the Scots Presbyterians who were
and are at the Helm, and that without countenance from these,
the Rabble durst never have attempted what they did against
all the Laws of the Kingdom, Religion and Humanity; which
plainly shews that Presbyterians, howsoever dignified or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
are all of a piece.</p>
            <p>Considering all this, one would be apt to think that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Episcopal Clergy in <hi>Scotland</hi> needed as much the assistance
of the Prayers and charitable Collections of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as either these Protestants in <hi>Piedmont, France</hi> or <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
especially since there seems to be something harder in our
Case than in any of theirs; for in those foreign Parts, if a Man
complies with the Commands of his Superiors, (which I confess
would be sometimes most irreligious in him to do) then he would
have the same Protection and Benefit that other Subjects of his
quality are allowed to enjoy: But with us it's far otherwise, for
as it plainly appears by the third Collection of well attested Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
let men comply never so much with the Commands of their
Governors, yet they are in the same sad Case with those that do
not in the least comply; for nothing less than the utter and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
ruine of Episcopacy being according to the Covenant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed;
the Superstructure as well as Foundations must be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the Presbyters as well as the Prelates quit rooted out,
like <hi>Philistines</hi> from the holy Land; <hi>And is this nothing to
you, O all you that pass by?</hi> give Peace in our time, O

            <head>THE
CASE
Of the Present Afflicted Episcopal Clergy
in Scotland.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S nothing but a Charity agreeable to its Divine
Original, could move you, to be so solicitous
to know the present Afflicted State of the
Episcopal Clergy in <hi>Scotland;</hi> so nothing but
your. Command could have obliged me to
this short, and plain account of it.</p>
            <p>Upon what Ground the present Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Scotland</hi> have thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it to abolish
Episcopacy out of that National Church, I will not at present
strictly enquire into: Only I may be allowed to say, without
offence, That since this Parliament has not judged convenient
to abolish it, as a Government either Antichristian, or contrary
to reason, or Scripture, or Antiquity, or the Universal opinion
of Protestant Churches abroad, or Learned Men in all Ages;
but only as contrary to the <hi>Inclination of the People,</hi> and (as such)
a <hi>Grievance.</hi> It may be considently hop'd, That when Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
or the Usurped Authority of Presbyters without Bishops,
shall become a Grievance to the People, (for what has been so
heretofore, may be hereafter) and so contrary to their Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that then, and in that Case, Episcopacy may for the same
reason by Authority of another Parliament be restored again.
This is no new thing, for before this Revolution, Episcopacy in
<hi>Scotland</hi> has been abolished twice by Act of Parliament, but so
was also Presbytery; It's now abolished the third time, and so
Presbytery may be. But with this difference, That Presbytery
was never setled by Law in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but when either our Kings
were involv'd in Intestine broils, or when the Civil Government
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41758:6"/>
was under some great convulsion occasion'd most ordinarily by
the practises of that Party, which put them under a kind of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
(not choice) to allow it. But no sooner did either our Kings,
or the Government reassume their just freedom, and vigour,
but as soon was Episcopacy both restored and established by Law.
So that Episcopacy having been always setled in our Church in
time of peace, or at the Restoration of it, May it please God to
restore peace to the State, that order in the Church may be it's
happy effect. And may we make better use of these two bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
then we have done hitherto.</p>
            <p>But as for the inferiour Clergy of Presbyters, who were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into the protection of this Government,<note place="margin">

or by any manner of way interrupt or hinder the Clergy in the
exercise of their Ministry, and peaceable possession of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings,
They demeaning themselves as it became peaceable and
good men. As for them, I say, to be turned out of their Churches
in so great numbers, may justly make strangers think these men
guilty of hainous villanies and crimes, which have provoked the
Government against them, and obliged it to turn them out of
their Livings, and forbid them all exercise of their Ministry,
to declare their Churches vacant, and to order themselves and
families to remove from their dwelling-houses in the middle of
winter.</p>
            <p>To Set then this matter in its true light, it will be necessary
to look a little back upon some things which happened before
the proceedings of the Privy Council against the Episcopal
Clergy.</p>
            <p>Be pleased therefore to know, that there have been Ministers
turned out and deprived since the beginning of this Revolution,
by, and under a threefold Authority.</p>
            <p>The first turning out was by the Authority, or rather Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the Rabble in the Western and Southshires only.</p>
            <p>The Second was by a Committee of the Convention of Estates
during the Interval betwixt the Convention and turning it into
a Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:41758:6"/>The third was by the Privy-Council since the first Adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Parliament.</p>
            <p>As for the first t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rning out by the Rabble, it being executed
in a time when the Government of the Nation was in a manner
quite dissolved, there is less wonder, that disorders of that kind
fell out, then it is accountable why they should not be redress'd
now, upon this Governments assuming its Authority, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Power to make it self obeyed.</p>
            <p>But before I give you the true matter of fact of this highly
presumptuous, and unparalell'd attempt of the Rabble upon Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
It will be first convenient to set before you the then
State of those Western Shires in matters of Religion; What was
their behaviour towards the Clergy Established by Law, as also
how they stood affected to the Presbyterian Ministers then To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated
by King <hi>Iames</hi> to hold Meeting-Houses.</p>
            <p>And first, Tho' it must be confessed that the Western Shires
of <hi>Scotland</hi> have been, and are, the most disaffected Party of the
Kingdo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to Episcopal Government, and have suffered much for
the Rebellions which their prejudices against it occasion'd; yet it's
as true, that before the last Indulgence granted by K. <hi>Iames An.
1687.</hi> they were Universally in a good Understanding with
their Ministers, tho' not in that degree as the Relation betwixt
Minister, and People doth require it, being more in shew then
affection. For tho' they came generally to Church, and owned
that they had overcome their Scruple of Conscience of not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
freedom to hear them Preach, yet they still separated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from partaking of the Holy Communion when offered:
Making it a greater matter of Conscience to receive that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt
from their hands, then the other of Baptism for their
Children.</p>
            <p>It is also to be presum'd, tho' not much to their credit, that
there was more of constraint, for fear of Penal Laws, then a
willing mind in this little Conformity they yielded in coming
to Church, all which soon appeared.</p>
            <p>For in the next place, upon K. <hi>Iames</hi> his Declaration of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Preachers to these Meeting-Houses, and to contribute for their
Maintenance.</p>
            <p>With this State of Affairs they seem'd so well satisfy'd, that
they made Addresses of thanks to King <hi>Iames,</hi> in terms, which
were no less acceptable to the then Court, than Scandalons to
all Judicious Protestants in both Kingdoms.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide.</hi> The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

having been Printed and Published in <hi>Gazetts,</hi> I shall take no
more notice of them.</p>
            <p>They were often told by wise Men, that they were running
a course in accepting of that Tolleration, most destructive to
the Interest of the Protestant Religion, and that it would be
much safer for them to continue in their Parochiall Churches as
by Law Established, since every thing that weakened that fence,
tended to the letting in of the Popish Party, which in time might
destroy us both; that Tolleration being granted in both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
in order to bring in Popery, and by the means and favour
of Papists at Court obtain'd and managed.</p>
            <p>Tho' many, yea most of the Inferiour People of these We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
Shires at the first went into this snare, yet the Persons of
greatest Quality and interest among them, did not so soon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply:
And for the other Shires in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in some there were
not above two Meeting-Houses in the whole Shire, in others
none at all, which, by the by, is a kind of demonstration, how
little fond the Generality of the Nation was then of that way,
and how the inclination of the People was then set, now so much
talked of.</p>
            <p>But next, to show you how the Presbyterians stood affected
to one Another, and among themselves, be pleased to know:
That there was a Presbyterian Party then in the West, of the
meaner sort of the People indeed, truly Acting more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequentially
to the Presbyterian Principle and Practice in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times, who (for all that was done) would not accept of
this Tolleration given by King <hi>Iames;</hi> But did openly by their
Sermons and Pens declare their dislike of it, and said much more
bitter things against their Indulged Presbyterian Brethren, who
had accepted this Toll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ration, than against the Clergy Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Law. Where-ever these Preachers came, they carryed
gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> numbers of the People after them, and would Preach nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41758:8"/>
in Church nor Meeting-House, but in the open Fields, for
which they were called Field-Preachers.</p>
            <p>This boldness the then Government found it self obliged to
take notice of, and they fell upon a Method to suppress it, which
in all appearance had done it effectually, if the Scene of Publick
Affairs had not been changed by this Revolution. It was, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Commissions to such Gentlemen in each Shire, as were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
leading men of that persuasion, or at least much favouring
that way, To hold Circuit-Courts within their own districts,
and upon seizing any of these Hill-Men, or Field-Conventi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lers,
to punish them as the Law ordained. This was a Stratagem of
the then Statesmen, to cleave that Party with a wedge (as we
say) of their own Wood. But that nothing was effectually done
is to be attributed to this great change of our Affairs.</p>
            <p>Now to return to the Account of the Ministers being turn'd
out by the Rabble. Upon the certain News of the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi>'s landing in <hi>England, King Iames</hi> called all his standing
Forces in <hi>Scotland</hi> to his Standard in <hi>England.</hi> This did directly
break our Government, it le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t the Nation without Defence, and
gave all discontented People a favourable opportunity to execute
their resentment, as their passions and Interests moved them,
and none having greater and more violent then these Hill-men,
or Field-Presbyterians, they prosecuted them with equall fury
and disorder.</p>
            <p>The First Commotion that appeared was amongst these Hill-Men,
or <hi>Cameronians,</hi> (so called from one of their Leaders, and
a Preacher, <hi>Cameron</hi>) They Assembled themselves
in the Night time, and sometimes in the day, in small bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
armed. And in a hostile way went through the Countries,
forced their entry into private Mens houses, against whom they
had any private quarrell, but most ordinarily into Ministers
Houses,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide.</hi> The First Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of some Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, relating to the practice of the Rable before the Convention met.</note> where they with tongue and hands, committed all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
imaginable against the Ministers, their Wives, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
where having eat and drunk plentifully, at parting they
used to carry the Minister out of his House to the Church-yard,
or some publick place of the Town, or Village, and there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
him to the People as a condemned Malefactor, gave him
strict charge never to Preach any more in that place, but to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41758:9"/>
remove himself and his Family out of it immediately; And for
the conclusion of all this Tragedy, they caus'd his Gown to be
torn over his head in a hundred pieces, of some they spared not
their very cloaths to their Shirt. When they had done with the
Minister, they call'd for the keys of the Church, lock'd the doors
and carryed the keys with them; And last of all they threw the
Ministers furniture out of his house in many places, as the last
Act of this barbarous Scene.</p>
            <p>This was the most General Method when the Minister was
found at home, but in case he was absent, they entred his house,
made Intimation of their Will and Pleasure to his Wife and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
bidding them tell him,<note place="margin">

               </note> to remove from that place: if
they found not a ready obedience, they would return and make
him an example to others.</p>
            <p>This course went on in the Months of <hi>December, Ianuary,</hi> and
<hi>February, 1688/9,</hi> by which were turn'd outword of their Livings all
the Ministers of the Shires of <hi>Aire, Ren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and protection in this their sad distress. In the mean time the

without Molestation, untill the setling of the Government by

of the time, as was pretended, not allowing that to be sent down,
all was referred to the meeting of the Estates, who being met,

            <p>Upon all this, the afflicted Ministers saw clearly there was

            <p>This their Case ought the rather to be commiserated; there
being no Authority upon earth, that can be so much as pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by which they suffer, except that of the Rabble. They were
never since that time either cited, accus'd, or condemn'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any Judicature for any fault or crime, so that in common
Justice they have still a right in their Persons to those Livings of
which they had quiet and Legal possession, before these troubles,
and if the wisdom of the Nation in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e next Session of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
shall judge it either <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it or convenient to remove them from
these their Livings, That Law determining this affair, if any
such shall be made, can only take place from the date of it, it
cannot look back, and make men guilty before it was E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacted,
so that still it must remain without controversy, that
whatever may be determin'd to be done with the Ministers for
the time to come, they have still a just and unquestionable title
to their Livings, until a Sentence pass against them which is
not yet done.</p>
            <p>This being their Case, it's not to be imagin'd that there will
be found any man of reason, or ordinary quality, who will so
much as open his mouth, in favour of these violent, and Illegal
extrusions in the next Session of Parliament, for it's well known
to all, how at the time, when this Tragedy was acted, none of
these Presbyterians, who are now in Power, did either avowedly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41758:10"/>
own, or openly countenance these proceedings, but did pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
condemn them, so that what was morally evill in its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall,
time cannot make good, nor will good men either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>send
or countenance. Whatever may be said for some inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
which might have happened in that Country, so fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
with passion and prejudice, if these Ministers had been
ordered to return to their charges there by the present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet it's certain when men are innocent, they ought not
to suffer, and therefore as was just now intimated untill the
wisdom of the Nation shall determine this matter, they ought
to be look'd upon as Legall possessors, tho' violently extruded.</p>
            <p>But that which no doubt will seem very extraordinary to any
unbyassed thinking man, is, that these Presbyterian Preachers,
who so heartily thanked <hi>Kind Iames</hi> for the liberty of their
Meeting-houses,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide.</hi> Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress to King <hi>Iames,</hi> in the Fourth Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</note> with extraordinary and fulsom strains of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
thereby approving the dispensing Power without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
(which was the Stile of our <hi>Scots</hi> Tolleration) And did
disown these cruell proceedings against the Episcopall Clergy,
yet they would never consent to Preach against such disorders,
tho' often desir'd so to do, by wise and discreet men; yea, which
is more, these same (as they called themselves moderate)
Pres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yterian Preachers, in a little time after, very confidently
took Possession of the Churches of the Orthodox Ministers thus
thrust out of their dwelling houses, and Glebes, without the least
Title, or right to them, except what flow'd from the consent
of some Phanatick People who own'd them, and their Meeting-houses,
which was a Notorious Encroathment, not only upon
the Property of the Legal Incumbents, but also upon the right
of Patrons, not as yet taken away by Law.</p>
            <p>For when the rest of the Episcopal Cleargy who were in
quiet possession of their Churches, and in good Understanding
with their People, were Allarm'd, with the hard usage of so
many of their brethren thrust out in the midst of a severe Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by this yet greater and more violent storm in the West,
with their Wives and Children, to seek shelter from these
their brethren.</p>
            <p>This gave such a damp, and rais'd such a just apprehension
in their Spirits, what might be the sad and Tragical event of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41758:11"/>
unparallell'd proceedings; that it's no wonder many of them
were provok'd to think that the great design of some within
the Kingdom, who appeared so zealous for this Revolution,
was more to destroy the Clergy and the whole Epis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>opal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
then to settle the Kingdom upon its Just and Antient ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,
or to preserve our Religion, Liberties, and Properties as
by Law then Established.</p>
            <p>This Apprehension grew yet more strong when they saw
that the Convention of Estates,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide.</hi> A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention in the Fourth Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</note> did not take the Ejected Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the <hi>West</hi> into their Protection, by their Proclamation,
which was extended only to those who were in the Actual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of their Ministry; By which it was plain enough, that
all those Ministers, who had been violently turn'd out by the
Rabble in the Western-shires were still to be kept out, and the
advantage the Privy-Council has taken from that Proclamation,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide.</hi> An Act of Council in the Fourth Collection.</note>
of late, to stop the course of Justice, from giving them access
to their Tithes and Stipends due to them, is a sufficient Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
how some incline to treat them, if the ensuing Session of
Parliament be not more savourable.</p>
            <p>This was the prospect of Affairs, and the temper mens minds
were in towards the Clergy, when the <hi>Convention of Estates,</hi>
having for faulted <hi>K. Iames,</hi> declared <hi>K. William</hi> and <hi>Q. Mary,</hi>
King and Queen of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>

               </gap> his
right to Govern that Kingdom, they therefore forbid any
publick Prayers to be made for him, and Ordai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> that in
all time coming, the Ministors should pray for <hi>K. William,</hi> and
<hi>Q. Mary,</hi> as <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ordaining also that
this Proclamation be read, upon the next <hi>Sunday</hi> after Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
by all the Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and in all other parts
of the Kingdom on such certain Sundays, as are therein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
with certification, that who-ever should not read the
said Proclamation and pray for the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> as therein
design'd, should be deprived of their Churches and Benefices.</p>
            <p>Upon the not Obeying of this Proclamation it is, that all
the Ministers of late, have suffered, and do suffer at this day,
and therefore that falls next under Consideration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:41758:11"/>And first of all, it's here more especially to be remarked,
that this Proclamation being Published in Common Form at
Eleven a Clock in the Forenoon on a <hi>Saturday,</hi> did not appear
in Print till about Seaven that Night. So that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> who were required to read it to their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
after Sermon next Morning, had no notice, nor Copies
of it given them, untill about ten at Night upon <hi>Saturday,</hi> or
Eight in the Morning on <hi>Sunday;</hi> which in a matter of so vast
moment, as to translate Allegiance formerly sworn to one <hi>King,</hi>
and in so short a time, to resolve to preach it due to another,
without so much as knowing the reasons and grounds upon
which the Convention had proceeded to for fault <hi>King Iames,</hi>
was to require a peice of blind obedience, which with so much
reason, we abhor in Papists, neither had <hi>Ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g William</hi> and
<hi>Queen Mary</hi> then accepted of the Crown. So that what the
Convention required could not be supposed, so soon and easily
done, by Men who either make Conscience in taking such an
Oath, or resolve to keep it.</p>
            <p>Here to this purpose, I cannot but give you an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Passage, which I sind in a Paper bearing for Title, <hi>A
Vindication of the Procedings of the Convention of the Estates in</hi>
Scotland. They are the very first words in that paper. <q>The
Dethroning of a King (saith that Author) and the Setling
the Crown upon the head of a new Soveraign, is certainly a
Matter of so great weight, of such vast importance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
that it requires the most serious and deliberate, the
most calm and imprejudic'd minds to determine it; a hasty
and undigested resolution, if in any case dangerous, would
unquestionably in this prove fatall and remediless:</q> Thus he
very judiciously: Now if this be reasonable, as surely it is,
then the requiring so hasty and precipitate obedience from Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
in this point, cannot but appear very hard, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if this Author had been consequentiall to his own rule, he
had certainly said something in favour of the Scots Clergy, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whose skirts he has lately sit so hard.</p>
            <p>There is another Consideration in this Case which ought very
much to alleviate, if not excuse the supposed guilt of Ministers
in the Country, who did not read the Proclamation; and that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41758:12"/>
is, it was not delivered to most of them in due time. Not the
first, for the Sheriff-clerks who (I remember well) were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to send them to the respective Ministers in their severall
districks, did not for the most part deliver these Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
till the day appointed for reading them, was past. How
universall this neglect of those Officers was, I will not posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
assert; but sure I am, most of the Ministers turn'd out
by the Privy-Council had this Legal defence for themselves,
that they receiv'd it not in due time to read it; and that it was
not in the second place deliver'd in due form is also clear, for
whereas in all times preceeding, such publick Papers which were
to be read after Divine Service, were allways transmitted to
the inferior Clergy by their respective Ordinaries, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Bishops not being then abollished, but still a third Estate
of Parliament, they were not obliged in law to take notice of
a publick Paper which came not to their hands in the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
Legal manner.</p>
            <p>Moreover it is well known how in <hi>England</hi> the strongest
heads and pens have been employed of late to clear this point
of Allegiance as now required. And how many severall To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piques
have been made use of to prove the Subjects dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
from their first Allegiance, and yet how many in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
eminent both for Character and Conscience are still doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of the point, which sufficiently shows, that the matter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
and requir'd a considerable space of time for deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Which not being given in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to the Clergy there, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one may easily judge what anxieties, doubtings, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties
such a weighty affair would create in the Spirits of
honest and well-meaning men. Surely tho' this has not, it se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ms
excus'd, in rigour of Justice, it will surely much alleviat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

good men, who make the measures of their dealings with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
such as they would that other men in like cases should
take with them.</p>
            <p>But to make the matter yet more favourable of their side,
There are some, who tho' they did not read the Proclamation,
yet have prayed for K. <hi>Will</hi> and Q. <hi>Mary</hi> conform thereunto,
whereby they answer'd the ends of it to all intents: yet these
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41758:12"/>
have been condemn'd to the same <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ate, with those who out of

mark of any tenderness or charity to reclaim men, who are
supposed to be wrong, but looks rather like a design to ruine
them in spite of their Complyance.</p>
            <p>But now we come to give account, how the Proclamation,
and the certification therein was executed by the Government
against the Delinquents.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide.</hi> A Proclamation from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention in the Fourth Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</note>
            </p>
            <p>No sooner were the Commissions sent up by the Convention
of Estates to make offer of the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> to K. <hi>William</hi>
and Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> but they adjourned themselves. Having first ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pointed
a Committee of their number to sit at <hi>Edenburgh</hi> till
their return, and they having received Information from the
Presbyterian party, in and about <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> that some Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
had not read the Proclamation upon the day assign'd, and
had not pray'd for K. <hi>Will.</hi> and Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> which was no great
wonder, considering what's said before, what Scruples so great
a point, as translating A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>egiance was apt to create, and that
they had so little time to be clear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d of them, yet an Order was
Issued forth, to cite them to appear before the said Committee,
who being cited, did appear, and tho' they pleaded Scruple of
Conscience and want of time, yet were by formall Sentence of
the said Committee depriv'd of their Livlngs, and their
Churches declar'd vacant immediately without any regard
had to their just defence.</p>
            <p>As this fell out upon these who liv'd in <hi>Edenburgh</hi> or places
next adjacent, so some of them were depriv'd before King
<hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> had accepted of the Crown, or taken
the Coronation-Oath, which the claim of Right required as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensibly
necessary in order to their being own'd as Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns:

            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:41758:13"/>A stop having been put to any further Prosecution of the
Ministers by the Committee of Estates, and as they with joy
were willing to believe, by King <hi>William's</hi> Order and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
this whole matter of depriving was laid aside, and men
began to think themselves happy, or lucky, who had escap'd
the first tryall, hoping there was to be no further enquiry
made after such a disobedience which had so many Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
to alleviate the guilt, if not quite extinguish the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of it, they hop'd at least that the favourable things in
their Case, would have been proper grounds for a new King
to forgive what had pass'd before his Entrance upon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
and the lenity and tenderness shew'd to Persons
obnoxious enough in other trusts under him about the same
time, inclin'd the Episcopall Clergy to expect the like, when
their case should come to be dnely and impartially represented;
for seeing his mercy extended to Out-laws and Criminalls of
the Grossest Sieze, they who are Gods Ambassadors doubted not
to pertake of it, their escapes, if such they may be called, being
only in points very dubious and material.</p>
            <p>And for a good time they seem'd not to be mistaken of their
hope, for during th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> whole Session of Parliament, no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was made of any further proceedings against them. Yea, one
thing gave no small encouragement: That when the Act of
Parliament pass'd for obliging all persons in Civill and Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Capacities to take the <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> the Clergy were
not comprehended in that Act, and tho' it were once mov'd
in the house, that the Oath should be put to them as well as
to others, yet did not obtain; This made many believe that
Peace and Settlement were really in their prospect, and that
all designs of ripping up the old quarrell for not reading the
Proclamation, were quite laid aside, and more tender mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
to be us'd, which are certainly the most effectuall in
such Cases.</p>
            <p>But there are some who thought, the true reason why at
that time the Clergy was not ordain'd to take the <hi>Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance,</hi>
was more out of respect to the Presbyterian Preachers,
than the Episcopall Ministers: for those of their own party in
the Parliament, who best knew their inclination that way, had
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41758:13"/>
reason to fear, they might Scruple at the same Oath, not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the grounds which others went upon, but because their
Modell of Church-Government was not setled by Law,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide.</hi> A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and the Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon it, in the Fourth Collection.</note> they
would not come under <hi>Allegiance</hi> to this King till first he had
done their business. And it's presumable enough, by what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them have since dropt in their S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rmons and other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses;
if this Oath had been put to them as to others in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
trusts, they had discover'd more of partiality to their
Interests, then of Loyalty to K. <hi>William:</hi> for it may by the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>
will be by some requir'd to be renu'd, before they think
their <hi>Allegiance</hi> either due, or right placed.</p>
            <p>But no sooner was the Parliament adjourn'd and severall of
the Chief Nobility gone to the Country, then a Proclamation
was emitted, (Surprizing enough because not expected) by
the Privy-Council, which did in express terms, to use the
words of it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide.</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations anent the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isters in the Fourth Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</note> 
               <hi>Invite and Allow Parisbioners and other hearers, to
inform against Ministers who had not read the Proclamation of the
Estates, and prayed for King</hi> William <hi>and Queen</hi> Mary, for the
one could not serve without the other.</p>
            <p>This General <hi>Invitation</hi> coming from such an Authority to
a hot sort of People, had a very ready Obedience pay'd to it;
For one or two of the meanest of a Parish, and sometimes the
Agents of the Faction in several Places, borrowed Mens Names
without their knowledge, to fill up their Citations, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these were thought sufficient to accuse their Minister,
upon which,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide.</hi> Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to the Ministers of <hi>Kelso</hi> in the <hi>4th</hi> Collection.</note> Summons were issued out to cite them to appear
at <hi>Edenborough</hi> within 6 or 10 days, before the Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.
Whereupon has followed the depriving of such as came
before them, and had not read the Proclamation. And this has
outed almost all the Parochial Clergy in the Shires of <hi>Marsh, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viotdale,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide.</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. in the Fourth Collection.</note>
the three <hi>Lothians, Fife, Striveling-shire, Perth-shire,</hi> and
some in <hi>Aberdeen-shire, Murray,</hi> and <hi>Rose,</hi> amounting (as I am
credibly informed) to the number of above two hundred, which
was all they could possibly dispatch in so short a time.</p>
            <p>Their whole Process went upon two Points. The first was,
whether they had read to their People on the day Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Proclamation Emitted by the Convention of Estates?
The Second whether they had pray'd or did pray for King

               <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary?</hi>

            <p>As to the first, their defences were, that they never recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

delivered to them as the Order for Publick Prayers used to be,

            <p>Oh! when will these things be seriously considered and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

be happily fal'n upon, as may quiet the minds and secure
the persons of all good, pious, and peaceable Protestants?</p>
            <p>I thought to have ended here, and given you no further
trouble upon this Melancholy Subject, but that I hear of a
plausible pretext given out to you in <hi>England,</hi> for this sharp
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41758:14"/>
handling of the <hi>Scots</hi> Clergy, which is, that there is no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
taken of any Minister who is willing for the time to come
to pray for King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> if he be otherwise
of approved integrity in life and Doctrine: But that the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
us'd is only against Scandalous persons, and so by this
means they are more easily turn'd out of the Church than they
should be by a Legal Tryal upon such an Accusation And since
this preten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e is made use of in <hi>England</hi> to their disadvantage,
where the truth of this matter is not yet so well known, I must
needs say something to it.</p>
            <p>And first, it's not ordinary for Men of vicious Lives, or
loose Principles in the Church, (as they pretend the depriv'd
Clergy to be) to make great scruple in disputable matters, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when the Penalty is the loss of their Estates, they being
generally too forward to comply with what's uppermost,
and prosperous.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, I dare confidently averr that after enquiry
made, it will appear, that there are many of as great Integrity,
Piety, and Learning as are in the Church involv'd, without
distinction, in that Common fate. And I dare appeal to the
whole Nation to make good against them such Scandalls, as
their Enemies have thought fit to blacken them with, in places
where they are not known. The Original of all this clamour
about the Immorralities of the Clergy, at first arose from the
too hasty Planting of Churches in the West, upon the Resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Government in <hi>Anno 1662.</hi> by which many
Young, Men were preferr'd, for whom the prejudiced People
could not be brought to have that Veneration and respect,
that they had had for their old Preachers which were depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for Nonconformity. This prejudice, together with the
Imprudent Conduct of some of these young Men begot a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of them, which was carryed by far much too high, for
Universally these Ministers were complain'd of, as the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Western Peoples withdrawing from their Churches.
But upon Bishops <hi>Leightons</hi> coming to the See of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and
bringing with him to those parts some very good Men and
choice Preachers, against whom the People could have no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
an Experiment was made to remove, if possible, that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41758:15"/>
Exception, yet he found this also ineffectuall: The Aversion
being more rooted in the Interest of a Party, then in the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
Immoralities of the Clergy. And therefore by his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Example of Piety and Devotion, of Humility and Acts
of Charity, by his frequent Visiting and Preaching in Country
Churches, thereby taking occasion to converse more intimately
and conveniently with the Ministers, he sow'd a blessed seed in
their hearts, gave them juster Notions of the Duties of the
Pastoral Charge, and thereby through the blessing of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a burning and shineing light in those parts, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
whereof remains upon the Consciences of many to
this day. But passing this,</p>
            <p>It had been a far more fair and Equitable way, and as much
to the Honour of the Government, as the disgrace of the guilty
to have <hi>Invited People to Accuse their Ministers</hi> upon the head of
<hi>Scandall,</hi> and after Evidence thereof, (if they had found any) to
have Proceeded and deprived, rather than Promiscuously to
have Condemn'd the Righteous with the wicked. It is true
their Libells were generally stuft'd with a great many Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and vitious practices alledged against them, (a malicious
design to expose them to the present Age, and to blacken them
upon Record to the future) but it is as true that when the
Ministers came to the Bar, the Scandalous and Immoral part
of the Libell was wholly omitted by their Judges, altho' the
Ministers themselves craved for their Vindication in those Points
to be particularly Tryed upon them, but the Sentence passed
against them upon the two heads before mentioned, and yet
in the Accounts they sent to Court, the Immoralities of the
Ministers Lives, which were only pretended in the Summons,
but never spoke of in the Tryal, were represented as the great
Grounds of their Deprivation; but it were far more easy to
give the true reasons, for truth tells best, and its this.</p>
            <p>The Presbyterian Preachers in <hi>Scotland</hi> of the old Standing
who only can pretend to be own'd in any Church-Meeting, (if
the Government should think fit to call one) are but very few
in Comparison of the Episcopal Clergy now in Place. It was
highly debated amongst them, what should be their behaviour
if the Parliament restored them to their Churches, from which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41758:15"/>
they were put out in the year 1662. They could not think it
adviseable to meet in Presbyteries by themselves, since in some
Presbyteries, they would make but two in number, and in
some but one, in others none at all. So that if they should joyn
with the Regular Clergy in such Presbyteries, they might reckon
to be out-voted in all businesses, &amp; so signify just nothing, Nay,
if a National Synod should be call'd, they would be at the same
loss, for the Members thereof Chosen by Presbyteries behoov'd
to be Episcopal Men, the Plurality by far of Voters being of that
way. So to take off all difficulties attending this matter. It seem'd
to be the most plausible &amp; effectuall way, to make as many Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancies
as was possible, and that also before the meeting of the
next Session of Parliament, least other measures should then be
taken, And for this design the premunire of not reading the
Proclamation seem'd next to Rabbling, the fittest and shortest
Expedient.</p>
            <p>I call it shortest, because it was not possible to make greater
dispatch for Vacancies, then it occasion'd, for a dozen of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
were ordinarly turn'd out in a Forenoon, and as many
more, sometimes, in an Afternoon. So that this Method made
clear way for the Presbyterian Brethren to be the greater part
in all Ecclesiastical Assemblies, and by Consequence to carry
any thing they please there. Hereby also they have a fair op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of setting out young Vagrants to take possession of
the Vacant Churches, by which the number of their Preachers
dayly encrcase.</p>
            <p>Thus you have the Present State of the very much Afflicted
Clergy in <hi>Scotland</hi> represented faithfully, and with as much
brevity as the matter will allow, for tho' much more might
be added upon this Subject, yet since you desired no more,
but a plain and generall Narrative, I here give it according to
my Ability.</p>
            <p>However it shall please Divine Providence to order Affairs
in our National Church, this you in <hi>England</hi> may be assured
of, that her Enemies, are yours also, and it is some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to us that those of that way are not like to prevail
so far over you, as they have done already over us. And
therefore that God may prosper and preserve the Church
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41758:16"/>
of <hi>England,</hi> restore ours to some Order and Decency, And
Settle the Three Kingdoms upon such Righteous Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

they rent his Gown in pieces over his head: they made
a Preface to their discourse to this purpose; that this
they did not as States-Men, nor as Church-Men, but
by violence and in a Military way of Reformation.</p>
               <p>In this manner, in the same place, and at the same

it as a Superstitious and Popish Book: thereafter they
went to the Church-yard where they publickly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
the Minister from his Office and Interest there.</p>
               <p>Upon the twenty seventh of <hi>December</hi> the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable

where they apprehended the Minister, and taking him
out of his house into the Church yard they rent his
Cloak missing his Gown, and thereafter forced him to
wade upon and down through the water of <hi>Irwine</hi> for
a considerable time in a severe Frost.</p>
               <p>Upon the said day they went to <hi>Rickarton:</hi> whence
they brought the Minister of the place to <hi>Torbolton:</hi>
where they kept for a whole night the Ministers of these
two Parishes under a Guard: and next Morning
brought them to the Church-yard of <hi>Torbolton</hi> where
they rent the Minister of <hi>Torboltons</hi> Canonical Coat,
and put the one half of it about each of the Ministers
necks, commanding the Church-Officer of the Place to
lead them thereby per vices as Malefactors, discharging
them from all Exercise of the Ministry, &amp; from their
Houses, Gleibs, and Stipends under the highest peril.</p>

               <head>A true Account of those Abuses and Affronts, that were
committed upon the Person of Mr. Robert Bell Parson
of Kilmarnock, by a Party of the Presbyterians now
in Arms in the West of Scotland.</head>
               <p>MAster <hi>Robert Bell</hi> Minister of <hi>Kilmarnock,</hi> being desir'd by
his Neighbour Minister at <hi>Richardtown,</hi> to celebrate the
Marriage of two Persons at that Church, in the Ministers
necessary absence, as he was walking thither, was seized by two
Armed Men, who came from a great Party which he saw at some
distance; one of them as he came near to him, presented a Musket
to his Head; whereupon he told him, he was his Prisoner, and would
go where he had a mind to carry him: He having recovered his
Musket, and placed him betwixt himself and his Fellow Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in Arms; in this posture he was brought to the Minister of
<hi>Ritchardtown</hi>'s House, where he was commanded to pluck off his
Hat, they calling him Rogue and Rascal, and treating him very
rudely. But assoon as he perceived they had filled their Bellies with
the Meat, that the good Gentlewoman had set before them; and
their Passion and Rancour was thereby a little asswaged; he began
to ask the Commander of the Party, by what Rule and Law they
proceeded, in their appearing thus in Arms: He told him, <hi>By the
Rule and Law of the Solemn League and Covenant, by which they were
obliged to extirpate Prelacy, and bring all Malignants to condign Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
Mr. <hi>Bell</hi> replied, they would do well to take care that those
their proceedings were justifiable by the Word of God, and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to the practice of Christ, his Apostles, and the Primitive
Church in the propagation of the Christian Religion. He answer'd
him, <hi>That the Doom of all Malignants is clearly set down in the Word
of God, and their appearing thus in Arms, was conformable to the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Ancient Church of</hi> Scotland. From this House the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
was carried Prisoner to <hi>Kilmarnock,</hi> and in his Journey thither,
there was a Gentleman the Laird of <hi>Bridgehouse,</hi> who having come
to meet him, took the courage to tell the Party, that their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41758:19"/>
in Arms, and abusing the Clergy in this Hostile manner, were
but insolent outrages against all the Law of the Nation; and that
they would do well to remit their Illegal forwardness, together with
their pretended grievances unto the Parliament, that was now very
quickly to be assembled, by the care and affection that his Highness
the Prince had of all the Subjects of this Kingdom. They answered
him, <hi>To stand off and forbear giving Rules to them, for they would
take none from him nor any Man, and that they would not adhere to the
Prince of</hi> Orange, <hi>nor the Law of the Kingdom, any further than the
Solemn League and Covenant, was fulfilled and prosecuted by both.</hi> By
this time they were come near the Town, and they commanded the
Minister to pluck off his Hat, which he obeyed, yet at the same breath
they threatned to throw him in the River: And coming to the Bridge,
they met the whole Body of the aforesaid Party, returning from
the Mercat place; where they had caused the Church Officer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
up the Keys of the Church: And they discharged by way of
Proclamation the Minister, whom in an opprobrious manner,
they called Curate of <hi>Kilmarnock,</hi> from all intromission with the
Benefice and Casuality of the Church, or the least exercise of the
Ministerial Function. Assoon as they saw Mr. <hi>Bell,</hi> and understood
that he was the Parson of the Parish, he could see nothing in their
Faces, but the most insulting joy; nor find in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ir discourses, but
the most reproaching Language, that ever the greatest Criminal in
the World was treated with. After a long Consultation amongst
themselves, one of their chief Commanders came, and asked him,
if he had a Book of Common Prayer: the Minister desired to know
of him, why he asked the Question. He answered, <hi>That sure be
could not want that Book since he was educated at</hi> Oxford, <hi>and train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up to all the Superstition and Idolatry of the Church of</hi> England.
The Minister told him, perhaps he had half a dozen of Common
Prayer Books; he commanded him, to produce one of them, <hi>for
that would do their business.</hi> From this place they carried him back
to his House; and there compelled him to deliver unto their hands
the Book of Common Prayer of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> after this
they led him as a Prisoner bare headed, betwixt four Foiles of Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keteers,
through a great part of the Town unto the Market-place,
where the whole Party was drawn up in Battallia: Which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be about the number of two hundred well Armed, with fire
Lock Muskets of a very large size, most of them had also a pair
of Pistols but all of them one. In <hi>Kilmarnock,</hi> after the fashion of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41758:19"/>
most Mercat places in <hi>Scotland,</hi> there is a Cross erected, unto which
one goes up by steps on all sides, after the form of a broad Stare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case,
with which it is invironed. It was on the uppermost step, that
these rude Guards placed the Minister, two of them on the same
step, one on both hands; and so on every step as you go down
from the Cross, they ranged themselves before him: After this
they called for Fire, which was brought, then one of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
made a Speech to the People, that were gathered together
in great numbers from the Town and Country. He told them,
<hi>That they were come there to make the Curate of the place, a Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of Ignominy, and that they were obliged so to do, by virtue of the
Solemn League and Covenant; in Obedience unto which they were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
here their abhorrency of Prelacy, and to make Declaration of their
firm intentions and designs, to fulfill all the ends of that Oath: The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation
of the Discipline of the Government of the Church of</hi> Scotland,
<hi>as it is express'd and contained in the foresaid Solemn League and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.
And all this they attempted to do, not by virtue of any Civil
Power nor Ecclesiastical Power, but by the Military Power, and the Power
of the posture they were now in.</hi> These are the very words of this
Speech. After this another of their Commanders taking the Book
of Common Prayer, reading the Title Page of it, and extending his
voice very high, he told the People, <hi>That in pursuance of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
League and Covenant, they were now to burn publickly this
Book of Common Prayer, which is so full of Superstition and Idolatry;
and then throwing it into the Fire, blowing the Coals with a pair of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
after that catching it from amidst the flames, they fixed it on the
Spear of a Pike, and thence lifting it up on high, far above the top of
the Cross. Which Elevation was attended with Shouts and Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
down with Prelacy Idolatry and Superstition of the Churches of</hi>
England <hi>and</hi> Scotland. After all these indignities and impudent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
offered to the most reformed and best constituted Churches
in the World, they turned themselves to the Minister again, and
rudely in a very menacing manner, asking him, if he was an Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Prelate's Man, and of the Communion of the Churches of
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> he answered, he was, and did there confess
it to the whole World. Then they tore his Gown, one of the
Guard first cutting up the Skirt of it with his Sword, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it amongst their feet, telling him, <hi>It was the Garment of the
Whore of</hi> Babylon. One of them bid him promise never to Preach,
nor Exercise the Office of a Minister any more; but he refused,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41758:20"/>
telling them, that such a Promise lay not within the compass of his own
will, and could not be extorted by force, and that tho they should tear
his Body, as they had done his Gown, they would never be able
to reach his Conscience. Well, well, (says he) do it at your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril;
the Minister answer'd, that he would do it at his Peril. And
so they gave over troubling him any more, only asking, what he
had to say to them, he told them, he was extremely sorry to see
Protestants, so ingratefully exasperated against the best Protestant
Church in the World, that had done such Eminent Service to our
Common Religion and Interest against Popery: And withal pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God to forgive them, and not to lay these things to their
Charge.</p>
               <p>So the Minister was dismissed, they telling him, he was an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and obdured Curate and Malignant.</p>
               <p>This is a true Copy of that Account, of those indignities and affronts,
that were done unto me <hi>Robert Bell,</hi> by the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> now

               <head>Some account of the Outrages and Cruelties committed upon
the Ministers and their Families in the Presbytery of Irwin,
who own the Protestant Religion as it is established by Law.</head>
               <p>THE Ministers in <hi>Irwin</hi> Presbytery since the beginning of <hi>December,</hi>
have been so sadly and miserably persecuted by the Violencies
of a rabble of armed Men and furious Women, who have joyned
together in a most barbarous Confederacy against them, that they
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41758:21"/>
have been forced to fly and lurk so secretly, as that they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
to meet together in such full number as that they can parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
represent all their Grievances which are still daily increasing,
only three or four who have with much difficulty got together at the
concerting of this, do from their own proper knowledge of what
they have felt, and from certain accounts from the rest of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
declare, that all of their Houses have been invaded by these
armed Men, not only in the day time, but for the most part under
silence of night, and so many of the Ministers as did not secretly
escape, were most disgracefully taken to the Mercat Crosses and
other publick Places, and their Gowns torn in pieces over their Heads,
and discharged, with greatest Threatnings of Cruelty ever to enter
the Churches and preach again: They have also turned many of their
Wives and Children out of Doors, and are still proceeding to do so
to others, exposing them to the Extremity of the Winter Cold, and
to perish for want of Bread, when the Ministers themselves durst not
come near them for their relief. The particular Instances are so La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable,
and the Circumstances of them so many, as that it would
be a long work to enumerate them particularly, only this in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
is so well known over all the Country, that there needs neither
particular Evidences to prove it, nor more to be said to move the
pity of any that are capable to remedy it, and we under Subscribers

had done special acts of Kindness) came to Mr. <hi>Gabriel Russel</hi>'s
House the Minister of <hi>Govean;</hi> they beat himself, his Wife and
Daughter, carried away all the Utensils of the Church, and the Keys
of the Doors, discharging him to preach there any more under the
highest Perils.</p>
               <p>The same night another Party came to Mr. <hi>Robert Tinnic</hi>'s House
Minister at <hi>Calcheart;</hi> not finding himself at home, they turned his

to stay in the Stable all night with her small Children; of which Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
three have since been at the point of Death, through the Fear
and Cold to which they then were exposed. The next Lords day the
indulged Preacher in that part, possessed himself of the Pulpit; they
were his own Parishoners who treated Mr. <hi>Tinnie</hi> so. The same
Night, and much after the same manner Mr. <hi>Robert Bayle</hi> Minister at
<hi>Carmunnock</hi> was treated.</p>
               <p>On <hi>December 27. Anno 1688.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hugh Blair</hi> Minister at <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glen,</hi>

Worship and Sermon, a great Multitude of People, for the most

part Women, came to Church, with a design to have drag'd the
Minister out of the Pulpit; but he (by the advice of some of his
Brethren who were there) forbearing to go into the Church, and
endeavouring to retire without Noise, was fallen upon most barbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
beaten, and had his Gown and other Cloaths torn in many
pieces, altho he had been one of the Ministers of the said City twenty
four years, and lived most Christianly and inoffensively.</p>
               <p>The same day the same Rabble went to the House of Mr. <hi>Alexander
George</hi> Minister of the Barony Church of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> broke his Doors
with great Hammers; and notwithstanding he was at that time tyed
to his Bed by a very dangerous Sickness, they thrust into his Chamber,
and had undoubtedly drag'd him from his Bed, and perhaps mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered

come to his relief.</p>
               <p>On the Lords day thereafter, being the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary.</hi> there was
no Sermon in any of the Churches of the City. On the <hi>22th.</hi> a
Copy of a Letter was sent to each Minister in the City, the Tenour
whereof followeth.</p>
               <p>We are credibly informed that our pretended Provost <hi>Walter Gibsone,</hi>
and his Malignant Associates, are upon a design of having you restored
to your Churches, sometime this or the next Week, but if you will take
advice and prevent your own Trouble and perhaps Ruine, do not listen
to their Motion, for they are but laying a Snare for you, without reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon their own being taken in it themselves: Therefore consider what
you are doing, and if you desire Safety, forbear to attempt any thing
suggested upon that head, for assure your selves, that it will not be now
the Female Rabble you have to engage with, but must resolve in all
time coming for such a Guard as will be so sufficient and diligent, as
to protect you, not only in the Church (which even we doubt of) but
also in your Houses, and that both by night and by day; if you take
this warning, you will both save your selves, and prevent the Effusion
of much Blood, but if not, stand to your peril, which in all probability
will be more formidable than that of Mr. <hi>Milne.</hi> Let this be a
sufficient warning to you from those who by this desire to exoner them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>We doubt not but there are other Instances of the foresaid Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
within our Bounds before this time; but because of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Dispersion we cannot give any more particular accounts, only

as to the Instances above-named, we can make them fully appear
when called to it: In Testimony whereof we subscribe thir presents

               <p>SInce our last we received yours; and for a return, you are to understand,
that our Circumstances are still worse, and the opposite Party more
Insolent, Cruel and Barbarous. The Particulars are as follows, 1. That
Party invaded the Minister of <hi>Balantra</hi>'s House in open day, before many
of his own People, beat to the ground his Wife big with Child with the
butt end of a Musket, dragged himself to the Church-yard and back again
to his House, tare his Cloaths to his Shirt, wounded him with a small
Sword, and for warding off the Thrust, beat him severely with Cudgels,
and then commanded him under the pain of Death, never to preach any
more in that place. 2. Six of the Meeting-house Men came to the Minister's
House of <hi>Kirk Michael</hi> (himself being at <hi>Edinburg</hi>) beat, batter'd and
bruised his Man-Servant, commanded him (after they had lain two days
and three nights upon him) to go immediately from the House with all
that belonged to his Master therein. 3. They have possessed the Churches

               <p>In <hi>Irwin</hi> Presbytery both the indulged and Mountain-men have possessed
several of the Churches, have gone to the Ministers Houses, given them their
last Summons of removal, with all the effects thereof under pain of death.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Pasley</hi> Presbytery they have outed the whole Ministers (as they have
in all the West of <hi>Scotland</hi>) they have particularly ejected the first Minister
of <hi>Pasley</hi>'s Wife and Family, burnt his Gowns and Hat at the publick
Cross, and thrown all his Goods to the open Street. From that they went
to <hi>Renfrew</hi> (where the Ministers Wife was but nine days lain in of a Child)
pull'd her out of the Bed, threatned the Families present ejection, had not
one <hi>Cranford</hi> of <hi>Corsburn,</hi> who being occasionally there, prevailed with
them for ten days respite: the Ministers Wife upon this cruel usage, fell into
an high and dangerous Fever, under which, according to our last information,
she yet labours. The whole Presbytery of <hi>Dunbarton</hi> are banished from
their Charges. In <hi>Glasgow</hi> the Ministers are not secure of their Lives,
for some nights age they beat Mr. <hi>Miln</hi> in the Street the second time: They
went to the Minister of <hi>Calders,</hi> rent his Gown in the Church-yard, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
being from home, and commanded his Wife and Family to be gone imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
under the Penalty aforesaid. <hi>Sir,</hi> We who are here, are patiently
waiting for the effects of the Princes Declaration, which was solemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
over this Cross on <hi>Wednesday</hi> last. If it quiet the Country, we
are resolved to return to our Charges, a little time will inform us. We had
almost forgot to tell you, that on <hi>Sunday</hi> last the Meeting-house Preacher at
<hi>Diglass</hi> caused them to break open the Church-doors there, and went in
and preached. We have wrapt up things in as narrow a compass as was
possible: We have written nothing but truth in matter of Fact, and which
upon legal trial shall be made good by</p>

               <head>Information of the abuses done by the Presbyterians, who
frequent the Meeting-houses to the Ministers of Leving-Widtalder,
Bathgate, and Westcalder; in the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
of Levingstonne.</head>
               <p>UPon the <hi>22th.</hi> of <hi>Dec.</hi> last, about six a Clock at Night, about
Thirty Men in Arms came to the Kirk Town of <hi>Levingstonne,</hi>
and having set a Guard to the Ministers outer Gate, a Party of
them came to his Hall-door, which was shut, and pretending that
they were come to search for Arms, rudely craved to have entrance
into the House, offering, that if the Door were not opened, they
would set fire to it, and shoot in Musket-ball through it, to kill those
that were within, and forced the door with such violence, that the
double bar which held it securest, being quite broken, the Minister
was necessitated to make the door patent, thereupon about eight
of them entered the House, with great noise and Swords drawn
(the Ministers Wife having been brought to Bed, only six days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that time; which was not unknown to the Assassins) and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a great deal of rough and opprobrious Language, and unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
carriage towards the Minister (which so affrighted his Wife,
that she apprehending her Husbands life to be in danger, rose from
her Bed in great consternation, and having put on only a Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gown,
did on her naked feet interpose for his rescue) they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
him to go through the Rooms before them; with a lighted
Candle to guide them in their search for Arms; one of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so uncivil, that he offered to turn his Wife out of the Bed;
whereinto she had again betaken her self, and with much difficulty
was by the Minister disswaded from that Cruelty. This done, they
carried away such things as they thought fit, together with the said
Ministers Horse, but the Horse being quite spoiled returned the next
day: They also went to the Church Beadle's House, and robb'd
him of his Horse, and other things belonging to him, but the Horse
returned also the next day. The names of these Assassins for the
most part, and of the Gentleman that hounded them out, are well
known. 2. Upon the <hi>27th.</hi> of <hi>Ian.</hi> last, there came Nine Armed
Men to the Church of <hi>Levingstonne</hi> (it being the Lord's Day in the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41758:24"/>
Forenoon) and the Church doors being made patent to them, by
one of the Ministers Servants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because they had threatned to break
them up, they searched all the Seats of the Church for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and not finding him there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they went to his Mansion House,
and disbelieving his Wife, who told them that her Husband was
from home, they went through the House searching for him most
narrowly; and compelled his Wife to go before them with a light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Candle, belching out terrible Speeches against him; and they
not yet finding him, departed, and told some of the Ministers Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors,
who live in the Kirk Town, that if they had got their Curat,
they would have ducked him in the water of Almond, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
they were disappointed at that time, they were resolved to be
full of his Flesh. 3. Upon the first of <hi>Feb.</hi> instant, about sixty
Armed Men came to his House, and delivered to his Wife a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of removal, the true Copy thereof is hereafter inserted, and
having called for the Ministers Gowns (with a purpose (as they
declared) to tear them) and for the Keys of the Church door,
the Church Bible, the Communion Cups, Records of Session, and
all other Utensils belonging to the Church of <hi>Levingstonne;</hi> they got
the said Keys and Bible (all the rest having been put out of the
way) and these they delivered to <hi>Iohn Wilson</hi> in Long <hi>Levingstonne,</hi>
to be by him kept, and so departed. Follows the tenour and true

groaned under the insupportable Yoke of Prelacy, and having

to do; and they being informed of the place where his Gown lay,

Eight men with drawn Swords and Fire-locks, came to his

the Laird of <hi>Pompherstonne,</hi> with divers other good Neighbors, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed

for what they had done in defence of the Curat, farther averring,
that nothing was designed by them to be done to that Curat; but
what and much more was done this day at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> to the outing
and disgrace of all Curats there. 2. That upon the <hi>1st.</hi> of <hi>Feb.</hi> instant,
a considerable Company of men in Arms, came to the said Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters

only to search, whether he were at home or not (altho after the
search, they confessed, that they knew he was not there, because
sufficiently informed, that he had taken Journey on the <hi>Munday</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding,
and did not carry his Gown with him, which they resolved
to have if possible) and in a most barbarous manner, forced up a
Window at the foot of the Bed, where the said Minister Wife was
lying with her sucking Child, and thrust in their Swords and Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks
at the Window, which so affrighted her with the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

if they intended to murther her and her Family, they would but
allow her the favour to put on some Cloaths, and to recommend
her Self and Family in Prayer to God. This they nothing regarded,
but continued forcing up the Hall-door, until the Lock and bolts being
broken it was made patent; whereupon sixteen of them having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
the House, with Swords drawn; they conveyed the said Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
Wife, with her Suckling in her Arms to the Kitching, and
placed a man with a naked Sword beside her, whom they command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the laying down such fit and united Methods as would give punctual
Obedience to His Highness's Declaration, and procure the publick

interrupted these four or five Weeks by-past, by the illegal unchristian
Outrages of the Rabble in this place. And after a prudent Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

immediately subsequent to the Publication of the Prince's Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
being the Seventeenth of <hi>February,</hi> according to the usual and

all kinds of Persecution unto them in the legal Exercise of
their Religion. On the <hi>Sunday</hi> morning the Promiscuous Rabble
gathered themselves together upon the Streets, and hindered the
ringing of some of the usual Bells for calling the People to Church.
Yet the Magistrates thought fit to connive at the first Insolence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
willing upon any Terms to have the Exercise of their Religion,
and give Obedience to the Prince's Declaration. But the more
moderation the Magistrates shewed on this occasion, the more the
Rabble were inraged, publickly threatning the People as they went
to Church, to pull them out by the Ears. And particularly, they
seeing a certain Minister going to Church, they pursued him with
Sticks and Clubs, but he taking a House escap'd their Fury. When
the Magistrates were come near the Church, they found it sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with a promiscuous Rout: Upon this they desired the rude
People to go home in peace, but they returned Scolding and Bloody
Language, and flinging from them their Cloaks and Plaides, that is
Mantles, they gave the Assault with Staves and Battoons in their
hands unto the Magistrates; and particularly one of them giving
a severe blow to <hi>Iohn Bell,</hi> one of the late Bailies, and at this time
in company with the Magistrates. Upon which unsufferable and
scandalous Attack, the Magistrates gave order to the Towns Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
and Officers, to clear their way to the Church, and beat off
the Rabble; which being effected, the Magistrates, together with
all the People, entered peaceably into the Church, seating themselves
according to their Ranks and Qualities in the usual postures of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

After Prayers were ended, towards the middle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of the Sermon,
the forementioned <hi>Thomas Crawsurd,</hi> the pretended Captain of the
Guard, came into the Church, and cry'd aloud to the People, <hi>That
the Town was in Arms.</hi> He was answered, <hi>That five or six hundred
People of the best Quality in Town were assembled in Church, to the
Service of God, according to Law and the Prince's last Declaration, That
they were naked Men without Arms or the least intention to make any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance:
And if the Town was in Arms, he was more concerned to look
to it than they, he being the pretended Captain of the Guard.</hi> And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
he was told, <hi>That if the People in Church had designed any opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to such as might disturb them in the Exercise of their Religion, they
would have appeared in an armed posture (which out of a due respect to
the House of God and the Prince's Declaration they did forbear to do;)
and then he should have found them too strong for any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Party that durst

in Arms upon the Streets, and together with the Company that
was upon the Guard, they formed themselves in a great Body,
and then marched off under the Conduct of the Laird of <hi>Carsland,</hi>
taking their way straight to the Cathedral Church; when they
came to it, they fired both upon the People that had fled to the

there was a little Boy dangerously wounded on the Face; but at last
they broke open the Doors of the Church, and searching diligently
for the Parson they found him: They were disired by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
to dismiss the armed Men and go in peace, but they refused it,
telling, <hi>They would have out those People that beat off the Women and the
Men from the Church-door upon the first Vpr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>That the Disorders were begun by the Rabble against the Prince's Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and that the Magistrates could not, without doing infinite injury to
the Service of God, the Honour of the Prince, and the Authority of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
forbear commanding the Officers and Towns Servants to beat off
the Rabble that opposed their entry into the Church.</hi> And to this it was
subjoyned, <hi>That if they would lay down their Arms, or go home in
peace, and forbear the encouraging and protecting of the Rabble in those
Vproars, they could return in the same peaceable way from the Church
that they came into it.</hi> But this they absolutely refused to do, telling us,

                  <hi>They could not desert their Sisters the Women, that by this time were
assembled in great numbers upon the Streets and in the Church-yard.</hi>
After this they took up the Names of the People of the best Quality
in Church, and then they hurried us out by Fives and Sixes at
several Doors of the Cathedral, and so exposed us to the Fury of
the Rabble, which we had escap'd if th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The whole Congregation being thus maliciously dissipated, very few
of them did escape without Wounds or Blows; and particularly the

him. Sir <hi>Iohn Bell</hi> had above a hundred Snow-balls thrown
at him: The Laird of <hi>Borrowfield</hi> and his Lady, together with his

               <p>Upon the first <hi>Saturday</hi> of <hi>February 1689. George Dickson</hi> Cottar
to the Lair of <hi>Smelholm</hi> a profest <hi>Cameronian,</hi> brought to me an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>subscribed
Paper in the presence of my Family, in the which he, in
name of the Parochine, ordains me to cease from the Exercise of
my Ministry there, pretending in it, that I had no call from the
People, and that I was an Intruder, and had brought Troopers among
them; with this certification, that they would force and compel me to
do it. This much troubled me, to be upbraided for that of which I was
never guilty, and that by Persons whom often I kept from the lash of
the Law, and who had constantly heard me till the late Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and frequently taken the Sacrament from me, but from the
consideration of our Saviours Treatment from those to whom he was
ever doing good, I comforted my self, and resolved patiently to
bear and undergo this present Disaster, and whatever might follow
thereupon. This being represented to the Laird <hi>Smelholm,</hi> he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
me for a day to cease from Preaching, and withdraw, which
accordingly I did: The next Lords day I returned (laying aside all
Fears, not willing so easily and suddenly to be put from the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of my Ministry) and it pleased the Lord to grant to me, and to
continue with me, a safe Exercise of my Ministry without distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,
until the fourteenth of <hi>April</hi> hereafter, which was the Lords
day, on which day the Scum of that People, most of them not above
the quality of a Servant, yet all dwelling under the Laird of <hi>Smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm,</hi>

Preacher in a Meeting-house near by (as I am credibly informed)
did assemble with Staves and Battoons (having, on <hi>Saturday</hi> before,
warned me by a second Summons, and taking away the Bell-rope)
to oppose me that day; the Laird of <hi>Smelholm</hi> being acquainted by
me, of the said intended Uproar, at the ordinary time of convening,
came to the Church-yard, I following with my Family, and after
some communing with the said Rabble, his Tenants, who had been

Doors, and having enter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the said <hi>George Dickson</hi> (having received the Hire of eighteen
Pence from the rest, as he himself confess'd afterwards in my Beadles
hearing) approached furiously to draw me out of the Pulpit, which
a Son of mine (of sixteen years of Age) observing, stop'd him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he came near me; upon which there came t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

pulling the Hair off his Head, tearing his Hat, Cloak and Neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth,
which extorted from his Mother these words in the midst of
the Church, <hi>Murder! Murder!</hi> and forced me from the Pulpit, at
length the Laird quieted them. Upon all this I took Witnesses,
and withdrew with my Family, to the Neighbour Church, ever after
that they put Cattle of all sorts into the Church, frequently
threatned my self, watched every Lords day for my coming, to
Church, not to Hear me but Harm me: O the Sin of Stoning of the
Prophets, which brought sad Judgments on the Guilty of Old, is
now frequently among us practised, the Lord grant Amendment.
This forced me to Preach in my own House, while after <hi>Whitsunday,</hi>
and then it being reported to me by some, that if I preached any
more in the House, the said Rabble would eject me and my Family,
I ceased there, and preached in some Neighbour Churches: At length
they caused cite me before the Council, <hi>Sept. 28.</hi> where for not praying
for K. <hi>W. Nominatim,</hi> in my House, and not reading the Proclamation
there, I was deprived by the Council, and appointed to remove from my

Hazardous) and came to the City of <hi>Edinburg</hi> with my whole
Family, intending there the Education of my seven Children at
Colledge and Schools: This is a true Narration of what befel me at
<hi>Smelholm,</hi> among that People, who kindly received and joyned with
me in all the parts of my Ministry, until the said <hi>Dickson</hi> and others
of that Perswasion had conversed with them and frequently preached
among them; yea, I am credibly informed that this <hi>George Dickson</hi>
on a <hi>Saturday</hi> night as he came from <hi>Edinburg,</hi> lighted in a Change
House, and then the People desiring him to preach to morrow, he
answered, <hi>He would preach no more until they put away the Curate from

               <p>MR. <hi>William Bullo</hi> Minister at <hi>Stobo</hi> in <hi>Tweddale,</hi> was all the
Winter over most barbarously used by the Rabble, they having
many times, not only in the day time, but even under cloud of night,
with drawn Swords and Guns in their Hands, entered his House,
broke open the Doors thereof, and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>arched the same for himself,
and thereby did so affright his Wife and Children, that they took
Sickness through fear, and he himself for fear was forced to lye out
in the Fields in the coldest Winter nights: And after he had endured
a great many of their Onsets, about the beginning of <hi>April</hi> last, as
the said Mr. <hi>Bullo</hi> was coming home from the accompanying the
Corps of a Gentleman, they lay in ambush for him by the way, and
riding through a little Village in his own Parochine, where there was a
Meeting house erected, and where was the Dwelling-House of the
Preacher of the Meeting-house, out of which House there broke out
upon him a number of the Rabble (among whom was the Preachers
Servant-man) and with drawn Swords in their Hands, offered to
stobb him, and charged him to stand, and he putting the Spurs to his
Horse rode for it, they firing their Guns after him; and at last two
of them mounted themselves on Horses and pursued him, and chased
him farther than his own House, until at length the said Mr. <hi>Bullo</hi>'s
Horse gave over riding, and so they apprehended him, and told

him, they would instantly shoot him, and commanded him to his
Knees; and he desiring for a little time to pray; they told him, he had
lived too long; he answered, that was to quarrel with God, and
he wished them to consider what they were saying and doing, <hi>For,</hi>
said he, <hi>you are in passion: You Damn'd Rogue,</hi> said they, <hi>do you take

said he, <hi>Since you will do it, God have Mercy on my Soul, and God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give

They would forbear his Execution that night (it being then late of
the night) and would take him Prisoner to his own House, and guard
him there until the next day, and pronounce Sentence on him in
sight of the whole Parish, and would do further as they thought
fit: And accordingly all this was done, for to morrow morning they
sent through the whole Parish, and convened all that would joyn
with them against the said Mr. <hi>Bullo,</hi> and entered his House in a most
Hostile manner with their Arms, and commanded his own Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servant
to tear his Gown; and after many Altercations betwixt him
and them, they discharged him to preach any more upon the peril
of his Life: He told them, that he would receive no orders from them,
he came in by Authority and would not go out but by it. And about a
Fortnight or twenty days after this, they came upon his Family
(he being from home) and most cruelly threw out at doors his whole
plenishing and Furniture of his House, and locked up the Doors;
and upon the Lords day, whereupon he should have read the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
Proclamation for making Prayers for King <hi>William</hi> and Queen
<hi>Mary,</hi> and upon the day of Thanksgiving, they set Guards in the
Church-yard, lest he should have given Obedience. And thus was
he violently forced away from his Church, and is since deprived by
Act of Council, for his not Reading and Praying.</p>
               <p>The Names of these honest Gentlemen who offered to attest the

Not; so he continued for two Lords days thereafter doing his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial
Duties without Interruption: upon the third Lords day he goes
to the Kirk of <hi>Trailflat,</hi> where he is obliged to preach once a month,
and there when he was going to perform his Duty, there meets him
to the number of fifty Women and upwards, with Cudgels in their
hands, and enters the House where he used to go in, and came there
and most violently abused his Person, without giving any reason
why, and teared his Cloak from his Shoulders, and hauled him out
of Doors; which being done, they compassed him about and beat
him most severely with their Cudgels, so that some Persons who
was come to hear a Sermon, cryed out, <hi>Will you Murder a Man?</hi>
and after they had torn all his Cloaths (his Shirt not excepted) and
inquired how he durst come to preach there this day, being warned
before to desist, he answered, That they could not be ignorant of
a Proclamation issued out in name of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> which
was publickly intimate from the Cross of <hi>Drumfries</hi> the <hi>Wednesday</hi>
preceding, that all their Violencies and Injuries should surcease
until the Meeting of the Estates: They answered, That they could
not obey Mans Laws, but their King of Heavens Laws. He said
likewise unto them, <hi>Why do you put your selves out of that Frame
and Temper that is suitable to the Lords day?</hi> They answered, That
in doing to me what they pleased, they could not offend their King
of Heaven. After this he desired them to allow him some covering
for to defend his Head from the cold, after they had cut his Hat in
pieces, and trod the same, with the rest of his Cloaths, in the Mire;
all which they denied. After all this they required the Key of the
Kirk-door; he cried for the Beadle, who lived half a Mile distant
from the Kirk, who was not as yet come; upon which they sent
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41758:31"/>
two of their own number for it, and the Man being out of the way
they returned without it; so that the Minister was necessitated to
send again for the Key, which then came; during which time, which
was more than an hour and a half, he stood naked: Then they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
him about four at each Arm, others of them beating his Head
and Shoulders with their Fists, others of them Scratching and
Nipping his bare Back, and leads him along first to the Kirk-door,
and after entering into the Kirk, they required of him that he would
there confess all the Wickednesses he had done, as the Preaching
under a Popish Tyrannical King, and delating those who did not
keep the Kirk: To which the said Mr. <hi>Iames</hi> answered, <hi>God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
forgive you and me all our Wickednesses, and if you will have
the patience, I shall preach a Sermon to you, wherein I shall shew you,
upon what Ground you and I may build the Forgiveness of all our Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesses,
because every one that asks Forgiveness does not obtain it.</hi> After
which they came upon him with their Cudgels over again, and lent
him upon the Head and Shoulders, and said, <hi>Will you preach to us:</hi>
After all this they dragg'd him out of the Church, and caused
him to deliver the Key to one of them, and others of them cried,
<hi>Come all here, that we may all be alike in this Business:</hi> Immediately
after they fastened four to each Arm, as before, and leads him out of
the Church-yard until they bring him to a Myre, where they go
about the Myre, and takes up handfuls of Dirt; which made those
who had him by the Arms, to part from him, and threw the
same handfuls of Dirt upon him, and after they dismiss'd themselves.

The matter of Fact in short was this; Upon the Festival of <hi>Easter</hi>
last (a day observed with much Religious Reverence by all the
Christi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from that Catholick Society) eight Men in Arms with about
an equal number of Women, much in the same posture, came to
the Ministers Dwelling-house early in the morning; and having
forced open his Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, the good Minister, who was then busie in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
himself to serve God and his People in the Church, surprized
with the extraordinary noise, and hearing them ask so furiously for
him, came calmly to them, and modestly ask'd what business they
had with him; Whereupon one of them took him by the Gorget,
commanding him to surrender himself up to them as their Prisoner:
He ask'd them what he had done for which he should be made
Prisoner, and by what Authority they made him theirs: He was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
by a severe blow upon the Head with a Pistol, the stroke
knock'd him flat to the ground, and the Wound it made, would in all
probability proved mortal, if his Head had not been gaurded by a
thick Velvet Cap, which by kind Providence he had then upon it:
The Miscreant who wounded him, ordered him immediately to be
drag'd out from his Gate, which two of his Blood-thirsty Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices
as readily performed, beating him afterwards down into a nasty
Puddle; his poor Wife (then so big with Child that she expected
every day to be brought to Bed) running out to save, if she could, her
Husbands Life, was, at her first Appearance, knock'd down with the
Butt end of a Musket; she received many merciless blows, and had
her Head and Body severely bruised among the Stones where she was
beat down. Then <hi>Iames Harcannass</hi> their noble Captain at this
honourable Expedition, gave the word of Command to his Female
Janizaries, which was, <hi>Strip the Curate</hi> (for they think this a most
Disgraceful App<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>llation, and therefore they apply it to all Episcopal
Ministers) the order was no sooner given, than these Amazons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to put it in execution, for throwing away their Plaids, (<hi>i. e.</hi>
loose upper Garments) each of them drew from her Girdle a great
sharp pointed Dagger, prepared, it seems, for a thorough Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The good Minister lying panting and prostrate on the ground,
had first his Night-gown torn and cut off him, his close Coat, Wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat
and Britches ript open with their Knives; nay, their Modesty
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41758:32"/>
could not so far prevail against their Zeal, as to spare his Shi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t and
Drawers, but all were cut in pieces and sacrificed to a broken Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:
The forementioned Captain gave the finishing stroke himself,
with a great Reforming Club, the blow was design'd for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
Head or Breast, but he naturally throwing out his Hands to save
those vital parts, occasioned it to fall upon his Shin-bones, which
he had drawn up to cover his Nakedness; the blow was such, as
greatly bruised both his Legs, and made them swell extraordinarily
after; however the Captain thinking that they were broke, and
finding it uneasie for himself and his Companions to stand longer in
a great Storm of Wind and Snow which happened to fall out that
morning, he drew off his Company, and left the Semi-Martyr, who
afterwards by the assistance of his Servants, crawled home to his Bed,
and but a little after, the whole Herd of his Persecutors broke in
again upon him, and told him, They had treated him so, because he
prayed for the Tyrant <hi>York,</hi> (so these People ordinarily called King
<hi>Iames,</hi> tho he was too kind to them) and because he had presumed
to preach, and visit the Parishioners as if he had been their Minister,
which they had formerly forbid him to do; they required him also
to be gone from their Covenanted Lands, under pain of death, before
that day Sevennight, and never again to meddle with the Ministry.

Irwine and Kirknewton.</head>
               <p>MR. <hi>William Hamilton,</hi> a Man for the Integrity of his Life, Purity
of his Doctrine, Knowledge and Gift of Preaching beyond
Exception, was first Minister at <hi>Pemicooke</hi> in <hi>Midhotham,</hi> where he
served in the Ministry for several years with great Reputation: In
the Year 1681. the Clergy being required to take the Test, he was
one of these Ministers who scrupled to take it, and so was laid aside,
he lived privately and peaceably, following his Studies, till he had
again access to the free Exercise of his Ministry, which was first at
the Town of <hi>Irwin</hi> in <hi>Cunningham</hi> in the Wes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; the People there
are for the most part Presbyterians. <hi>The Exemplariness of the Mans
Life.</hi> The first Character I have given of the Man already, one
would have thought must have conciliate all Respect and Kindness
to him amongst his Neighbours, he treated them with all Discretion
and Civility, upon all Occasions, yea, at such Occasions as he was
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41758:33"/>
not to preach at himself, he went to hear him who preached in
the next Meeting-house, and went frequently to visit him, but all
this prevailed not; for about the end of <hi>Ian.</hi> 1688/9. these People
attacqued him, some of them came in the morning, and kept him
Prisoner all the Forenoon, till their Accomplices met, to the number
of about Fifty or Sixty, when they were all convened, five or six
of them seized him, and carried him through the Town to the Cross,
making a Show of him, and here were none of all these People of
his own Parish, but only two, but almost the whole Inhabitants were
looking on, and saw their Minister, who deserved so very well of
them, thus rudely treated, without rescuing him. When he was
brought to the Cross, they tore his Gown over his Head, and told
him, That that was their Testimony against Episcopacy; they took
upon them to discharge him to preach there again, and to command
him to depart from the<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>i. e.</hi> Parsonage House.</note> Manse and Glebe, which he the more readily
promised to do, because he was weary of living amongst them, and
had an Invitation to a Charge where he expected more Comfort and
Success in his Ministry, tho less Stipend. From <hi>Irwin</hi> he came to
<hi>Kirknewt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

About the end of <hi>February</hi> he exercised his Ministry there peaceably
until the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> at which time a company of armed Men
came to his House, about Nine of the Clock at Night (none of them
were his own Parishoners) and commanded him in King <hi>William</hi>'s
Name to preach there no more. He had complied with the first, to
the present Government in all things required of him, he made his
Application to the Committee of Estates then Sitting, who granted
him an Order to preach at <hi>Kirknewton,</hi> forbidding any Person to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb
him, or wrong him in his Person or Goods. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
this, in <hi>Iune</hi> another armed Company came about six of the
Clock one Night to his House when he was absent, and ejected his
Wife and six small Children, one of them very Sick; at this time
the Act of the Meeting of Estates in the Ministers Favour was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to these People, they read it, and dropt and trampled on it,
and said, they valued it not, tho it had been under King <hi>William</hi>'s
own Hand, this being again represented to the Committee of Estates,
they sent out Sir <hi>Iohn Maitland,</hi> one of the said Committee, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
about such unsufferable Insolencies, who came to the place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoke
some he heard were most accessory, and took a List of their
Names: Notwithstanding of this, not long after five Women assaulted
the Minister, who had been reponed and preached again.</p>

                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:41758:34"/>
His Servant and Horse coming from the Coal-pit, and the Servant-man's
Daughter coming out to her Father's defence, was ill hurt by
them, she fell in a Swound at this and at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Iuly</hi> 19. Yet again came a company of armed Men at nine at
Night, the Minister being occasionally absent, and were yet more
Outragious, and again cast out of the House his Wife, Children and
Servants; at this time also they cast out his Furniture, broke much
of it, took away several Books and other things he could ill spare.
Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> at his return, finding his Wife in a Coal-house, and
being informed how badly his Family had been used, concluded it

to preach. His Sick Child died before the last Assault. He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
finding it needful for him to take Physick, and having no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency

it being rendered otherwise useless; they cast out the Cloaths into
the Puddle; spared not the Chamber-pot, but beat out the bottom
of it with Halbards, left not his walking Cain unbroken. They
not finding himself in the Manse, they went to search for him in the
Coal-house; so narrow was the search they made, that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they left not
Feather-beds and Bolsters and Chests unpierced with their Swords,
crying, <hi>Come out Dog,</hi> (so they called the Minister) two and twenty
of them, all known Persons, after they had left the Cottage in which
the Minister then lived, met his Servant with two Horses coming
loaded with Coals to his House, they carried them back two Miles
after they had come six, and compelled the Ministers own Servant
to bring forth kindling to make a Bonefire of the Coals, which was
done just before my Lord <hi>Torphican</hi>'s Windows who lived in that
place. The Minister happened at the time to be in a House in the
Town in which one of the Heretors of the Parish lived, with a
Friend, about his business. These People who had so abused his
House and his Servant, got notice of his being there, and came to
the House and would needs see him. The Master of the House
and his Wife, being his good Friends, and stout-hearted People,
hindered these People from breaking open the door, which they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to do. They threatned to shoot a pair of Balls through the
door upon the Minister; at length they promised to do him no
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41758:34"/>
harm if he would come forth to them. Upon this he came out, and
when they saw him they had little to say to him, but that he had
no right to go to the Manse, it belonging to the Kirk, and he had
no right to that: He said he had returned thither not to dwell, but
only for a day or two to take Physick, he having no conveniency for
that in the Coal-house he then lived in, he behaved himself with
that Caution and Moderation, that they could not find the least
colour to do him further Injury, they only vented some foolish and
impertinent Words against him. All this I can prove by the Attesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Oaths of Famous Witnesses.</p>

from whence they were come, and to whom they belonged, and if

preach: Who answered, That they belonged to the Earl of <hi>Angus</hi>

preach, and that he should not preach there take his part who would.
To which it was answered by the said <hi>Patrick Porterfeild,</hi> That King
<hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and their Council had taken his part, and
authorized him to preach; and that accordingly he was ready to
preach and to read the Proclamation for the Fast if they would not

going for Church, I sent forth my Reader to know from them, why
they were assembled at so unseasonable a time, since they came not
to hear Sermon from me; and withal, That they would by some

               <p>YOUR Lordship knows how Mr. <hi>Paul Gellie,</hi> your Minister, has
deported himself in his Ministry at <hi>Airth,</hi> and has gained the
Affections of all the Parish, except three or four of the very worst of
them, and how he was removed from his Charge upon the Deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of two flagitious Fellows, who had resolved to Damn themselves
to get him out of his Ministry. If your Lordship can get his Cas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I Have sent the Testimony of the Heretors of your Lordships

their Testificat, with your own Knowledge, may procure an Order
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41758:39"/>
of Reinstallment from His Majesty to me, especially considering, that
to your certain knowledge I have given full Obedience to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and have in my Custody the Testimonies of an hundred and
fifty Heads of Families subscribed by them, ready to depone the
truth of my Obedience, and Innocency of what these two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
Persons witnessed against me: Yea, I have a subscribed Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of honest Men, offering to prove these two Witnesses (by whom
I was deposed) really perjured, and before credible famous Witnesses
one of them has confessed his Perjury. And if His Majesty be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of the manifest Injury done me by two perjured Persons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Testimony of the whole Parish, I doubt not of an Order
of Reinstallment; and truly the Falsehood, Malice and Cruelty of
that Party in your Lordships Parish, is so known to the Presbyterian
Ministers themselves, that scarcely any one will come and preach to
them; for tho they violently possess the Church, which they have
greatly abused, they had not a Sermon these divers Sabbaths: So that
our People not only want the preaching of the Gospel, but likewise
the Ordinances of the Lords Supper and Baptism. If I were present I
am assured to prevail, and if you judge it expedient, send me word
by a Line, and with the help of God I shall come on my own Horse
by Land, for I am afraid to venture by Sea. I would have sent the
Testificat of the whole Parish contrary to these two false Depositions
against me, but I am afraid they may be miscarried, and it would be
hard for me to recover them again at this juncture of time, but I think
your Lordships own Testimony will be sufficient with what I have
done. <hi>My Lord,</hi> I need not use motives to perswade your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to move herein, all are confident you both may and will prevail
for an Order from His Majesty for my Reinstallment, which will be for
your Lordships Honour, who is Patron, and for His Majesties Interest, as
well as my Advantage. I shall add no more, but pray for the Blessing of
God on your Lordship, Lady, and the whole Children, which shall ever
be continued by,</p>

               <p>The Reader is desired to take notice, because omitted in the Narrative,
that tho the Presbyterian Preachers, whom it is certain the Convention
thought <hi>Gospel-Ministers,</hi> were obliged as much at least as any others, to
read this Proclamation, and had it for that purpose sent them; yet they
were never called in question for their neglect of it, tho that was sufficient
to turn out the Orthodox Clergy, which to play the Pedant for once,
amounts to this in <hi>Latin:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Dat veniam Corvis, vexat censura columbas.</l>

                     <l>Show me the Man and I'll show you the Law.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The truth is, the Governours knew that many of the Meeting-house Preachers
could not be induced to do any thing in favour of any King, until he had first
declared for Presbytery and renewed the Holy Covenant, and this is the true
reason, why no Oath of Allegiance is yet put to any of the Clergy in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
either of the one Perswasion or the other; This Proclamation was not published
till <hi>Saturday April</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that night, and to some of them not till <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning, and yet upon that
short Advertisement, all were to satisfie their Scruples of Conscience against
next Morning, about Translating their Allegiance which they had Sworn to
one King, to another who had not then declared that he would accept the
Crown upon such Conditions as it was offered with; otherways they were
to be deprived; <hi>This is pressing of Conscience with a witness;</hi> and
'tis plain from the latter part of this Proclamation, that Men might offer
what Injury they pleased to Ministers of the Gospel, who were not then in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
and possession of their Ministry; that is indeed, to all the Orthodox
Ministers in the West, who had been some months before drawn from their
Possessions by the Rabble.</p>

               <p>THe coming of an Herauld and Trumpeter to Summon a Man
to lay down Arms, that is living in peace at home, seems to
me a very extraordinary thing; and I suppose will do so to all that
hears of it. While I attended the Convention at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
often of many peoples being in Arms without Authority,
which was notoriously known to be true, even the Wild Hill-men;
and no Summons to lay down Arms under the pain of Treason
being given them, I thought it unsafe for me to stay longer among
them: And because some sew of my Friends did me the Favour to
convey me out of reach of these Murderers, and that my Lord <hi>Leving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston,</hi>
and several other Officers took occasion to come away at the same
time, this must be called <hi>being in Arms:</hi> We did not exceed the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
allowed by the Meeting of Estates: my Lord <hi>Levingston</hi> and I
might have had each of us Ten; and four or five Officers that were in
Company might have had a certain number allowed them; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it will be found we exceeded not. I am sure it is far short of the
number my Lord <hi>Lorne</hi> was seen to march with. And tho I had gone
away with some more than ordinary, who can blame me, when De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of Murdering me was made appear? Besides, it is known to
every body, that before we came within sixteen Miles of this, my Lord
<hi>Levingston</hi> went off to his Brother my Lord <hi>Strathmoir</hi>'s House; and
most of the Officers, and several of the Company, went to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Homes or Relations; and if any of them did me the Favour
to come along with me, must that be called <hi>being in Arms?</hi> Sure when
your Grace represents this to the Meeting of the States, they will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
such a groundless Pursuit, and think my appearance before them

serve to discover the humour of the Times, and the impartial Iustice
of that Convention, the Rabble and Wild-hill Men went together in Arms in
formidable Multitudes both in the Country and City, and the Thanks of the
Convention was made to them for their good Services; they affronted the
Viscount of <hi>Dundee</hi> daily upon the Streets, and sometimes on the Night
attempted to Murder him in his House; all which was made evident to the
Convention, and no notice taken of it; but because my Lord <hi>Dundee</hi> and
some other Gentlemen, not willing to lye longer under those Dangers, retired
to their Country-houses only with such a Guard as was sufficient to secure
them from the Violence of the Rabble, which the Convention it self allowed
to Noble-men and Gentlemen when they travelled on the Road; upon this
account he was attainted of High Treason, and a Herauld and Trumpeter
sent to Summon him upon that account to appear and answer for his Life
and Fortune; by their own Messengers he sent back to them the preceding
Letter, and by the Tennor of it, I leave the World to judge who they were
that first begun the War in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which is not ended there yet, nor like
to do in haste, and hath cost the Nation so much Blood and Treasure since.</p>

               <p>THE Lords of His Majesties Privy Council, considering that by
the Act of the Meeting of Estates of the Date the Thirteenth
day of <hi>April</hi> last, there is a difference made betwixt the Ministers
then in possession and Exercise of their Ministry at their respective
Churches, and those who were not so. And that the Case of the
Ministers who were not in the actual Exercise of their Ministerial
Function the Thirteenth day of <hi>April</hi> last, lyes yet under the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the Parliament; and lest in the mean time they may
call and pursue for the stipend (alledged) due to them, or put in
execution the Decreets and Sentences already obtained at their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
for the same before the Estates of Parliament can meet and
give these Determinations in the Points. Therefore the said Lords of
Privy Council finding that the Case foresaid depending before the
Parliament, is not obvious to be cognosced and decided upon by the
inferiour Judges, but that the same should be left intire to the Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Parliament; have thought fit to signifie to all inferior
Courts and Ministers of the Law, that the matter abovementioned
is depending before the Parliament, to the effect they may regulate
and govern themselves in the judging of all Process to be intented
before them upon the said matter, or in executing Sentences already
pronounced thereupon, as they will be answerable.</p>

               <p>Was ever Iustice (to speak modestly) stretched so as in this Act; because
the Government in the Proclamation of the Date <hi>April 13.</hi> had left the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the West, who were forced by the Rabble from their Possessions, out
of their Protection, which was all the difference mode by that Act, was it
therefore not just to allow them any Tithes or other Debts due to them for
several years before, and for which they had obtained fairly Decrees and
Sentences in Courts of Iudicature, surely these Preachers, who by the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the Rabble had possessed their places, had no legal or just pretence to
any part of the Tithes or Stipends for which the others had served. With what
face then, or pretence to common Iustice could this be called a Case depending
before the Parliament.</p>

               <p>WHereas the Meeting of the Estates of this Kingdom, by their
Proclamation dated at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the Thirteenth day of
<hi>April, 1689.</hi> did Command and Require all the Ministers of the
Gospel within the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> publickly to pray for King
<hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> as King and Queen of this Realm, and
to read that Proclamation from their Pulpits upon the several Lords
days therein exprest; as also, the Estates of the Kingdom did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
and discharge any Injury to be offered by any Person whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,

who were then, <hi>viz.</hi> on the Thirteenth of <hi>April</hi> last, in
Possession and Exercise of their Ministry, either in Churches or
Meeting-houses, they behaving themselves dutifully under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Government. And it being most just and reasonable, that the
foresaid Proclamation be fully performed and obeyed, as most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for the Security of the Peace of the Kingdom, and that such
Ministers who gave Obedience should be Secure under the Protection
of the Law, and that the pain of Deprivation be inflicted upon all
those Ministers who have Disobeyed the Proclamation. Therefore
the Lords of His Majesties Privy Council, in their Majesties Name
and Authority, Do strictly Command and Charge, that none of
the Leidges take on Hand to do any Violence or Injury to any of
the Ministers of the Gospel, whether they be Preaching in Churches
or Meeting-houses, and that all such as were in Possession and
Exercise of their Ministry upon the Thirteenth day of <hi>April</hi> last,
be allowed to continue undisturbed, and that such Ministers as
have been removed, dispossessed or restrained without a legal Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
in the Exercise of their Ministry, since the Thirteenth day
of <hi>April</hi> last, shall be allowed to return, and Exercise their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry

and prayed for King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Tenor thereof, may be deprived of their Benefice, and

Sentence be deprived of their Benefices, and that none of the Leidges
at their own hand, without a legal Sentence and Warrand, presume

               <p>Some of the sad Effects of this Canting Proclamation were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly

for the design was to remove all the Episcopal Ministers from

Council. By their procedure against his Brethren he knew what
would be the event of this; and therefore it being his turn to preach
on that day he was cited to comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Parishoners being present, he delivered some Advices and Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which made the Sermon look somewhat like a valedictory one;
after Sermon his Elders attended him to the foot of the Stairs of the
Council Chamber. Mr. <hi>Ramsay</hi> is called and interrogated if he did
read the Proclamation of the <hi>13th.</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> he answered, <hi>I did read
it:</hi> Again he is questioned if he prayed for King <hi>William</hi> and Queen
<hi>Mary,</hi> naming them, (for it was not enough to use such Expressions
as were only to be appropriated to <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Mary)</hi> he said, He
had prayed for them by Name. <hi>But</hi> (says the President) <hi>you only
prayed for them as</hi> Declared <hi>King and Queen, not as those that were
really such.</hi> Mr. <hi>Ramsay</hi> replied, That he had prayed for <hi>William</hi> and
<hi>Mary,</hi> whom the Estates of the Kingdom had <hi>Declared</hi> King and
Queen, and since they had no Liturgy, and they had given to them
no Form of Prayer, he thought, being he had pray'd for <hi>William</hi>
and <hi>Mary,</hi> no more was to be required; and as for the words <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
King and Queen,</hi> he had taken them from one of their own
Proclamations; which when denied, he desired the Proclamation
might be produced, which was done, and then it appeared he was
in the right. When he could not be reached in this point, then the
President, the Earl of <hi>Crawfurd,</hi> said, <hi>But, Mr.</hi> Ramsay, <hi>you pray

They then ordered him to remove, and consulted by what other
way they might reach him, for yet they could not find a pretence
against him sufficient to deprive him. At last they called him in,

and the President said, <hi>But Mr.</hi> Ramsay, <hi>you did not read from the

you have nick'd me, indeed I did not intimate that Fast. But why
did you not? For many Reasons, my Lord,</hi> said he. <hi>But pray,</hi> said my
Lord, <hi>let us hear some of those Reasons. Excuse me, my Lord,</hi> replied
he, <hi>it's sufficient that I confess that I did not read it.</hi> (But according
to the method of their Inquisition of Screwing out Mens minds, and
provoking them to speak, that they might get occasion against them)
they press'd him to name some of his Reasons, he said, being they
urged he would give them one, <hi>That it was against the Practice of the

Prelacy, and the Superiority of any Church-Officers above Presbyters in this
Kingdom;</hi> did declare, <hi>That they would settle that Church-Government
in this Kingdom which is most agreeable to the Inclinations of the People.</hi>
And considering, That the Church-Government by General, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial,
and Presbyterial Assemblies, with the Sessions of the Kirk, as
it was established by the first Act of the Twelfth Parliament of King
<hi>Iames</hi> VI. holden in <hi>Iune 1592.</hi> is most agreeable to the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the People: Therefore the King and Queens Majesties, with
Advice and Consent of the Estates of Parliament, Revives and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news
the said Act of Parliament in the whole Heads, Points, and
Articles thereof, (with this express Declaration, <hi>That the necessity of
occasional Assemblies be first represented to His Majesty by humble Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:</hi>)
And Statutes and Declares, That it is, and shall be lawful
to the Presbyters of this Church to admit Ministers upon Presenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from the lawful Patrons, or <hi>Iure de voluto,</hi> which shall happen
hereafter; or into Churches which fall not under Patronages, but
were Mensal and Patrimonial Churches belonging to the Bishops;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41758:51"/>
sicklike and as freely as they did or might have done of before by
the foresaid Act of Parliament in the Year 1592. and to do all and
every thing which before pertained to Presbyteries, and were exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
by the Bishops. And Ordains all the Ministers in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to submit and conform themselves to the Church-Government
established by the foresaid Act, and to take the Oath of Allegiance,
under the pain of being deprived of their Churches, and losing their
Benefices. And it is Declared, That all Ministers that shall submit
and conform to the foresaid Church-Government, and to take the
Oath of Allegiance, without being obliged to take any other Oath,
shall enjoy their Churches and Benefices, and shall not be deprived of
the same, except for Scandal or Insufficiency. But in respect there
are several Ministers that were put out of their Churches and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
since the year 1662. for not complying wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h, and conforming
to Prelacy; and others since the year 1681. for not taking the Test:
And now seeing Prelacy is Abolished, and all Acts relating thereto, it
is just and reasonable that these Ministers that went out, and were
laid aside, for not conforming to, and complying with Prelacy, and
for not taking the Test, should be restored to their Churches and
Benefices; Therefore the King and Queens Majesties, with Advice
and Consent of the saids Estates of Parliament, do Ordain the saids
Ministers that went out, or were laid aside, upon the account foresaid,
to be restored and reponed; and do hereby repone and restore them
to their respective Churches and Benefices. And the King and Queens
Majesties, and Estates of Parliament, declares, That they will take
care to provide these Ministers that are now serving the Cure at the
saids Churches, with other Churches and Benefices, as occasion shall
offer; they submitting themselves to the Government of the Church
established by this present Act, and taking the Oath of Allegiance, and
being sufficient and qualified for the Office of the Ministry, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Scandal. As also it is Declared, That Intrants to the Ministry
shall not be holden or obliged to take any other Oaths at their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
but the Oath of Allegiance, and the Oath <hi>de fideli.</hi> And in
regard that much trouble hath ensued unto the Estate, and many sad
Confusions and scandalous Schisms have fallen out in the Church, by
Church-men meddling in matters of State: Therefore their Majesties,
with Advice and Consent of the Estates of Parliament, do hereby
discharge all Ministers of the Gospel within this Kingdom, to meddle
with any State-affairs, either in their Sermons or Judicatories, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickly
or privately, under the pain of being holden as disaffected to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41758:52"/>
the Government, and proceeded against accordingly. And declares,
That the Jurisdiction of the Church consists and stands only in
the preaching of the True Word of Jesus Christ, Correction of
Manners by Ecclesiastical Censures, and the Administration of the
Holy Sacraments, conform to the <hi>69th</hi> Act <hi>Iames 6. Parl.</hi> 6. And to
the effect there be nothing treated or concluded in the Church-Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories,
that concerns the Affairs of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the saids Assemblies, the said Person appointed by Their Majesties

there are many things to be settled in relation to the Policy and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
of the Church, therefore Their Majesties declare, That They,
by the Advice of the Estates of Parliament, and Judicatories of the
Church, will enact such Rules concerning the Policy, Discipline, and
other Matters to be observed by the Church, as shall tend most to the
curbing of Vice, the Advancement of True Religion and Piety, and

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41758:53"/>
them from controling the State when they pleased (as they had been always
wont to do when in power) for sometimes the Parliament and General
Assembly flatly contradicted one another, as in the year 1674. when King

from meddling in State Affairs, as they had been wont to do, leaving them
no power in the State, and the King some power in the Church, as that they
could not call a General Assembly without acquainting him with the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity

and the Presbyterian Minister who was then in Quality of a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain

            <p>SOme may perhaps think it an unkindness done to the Nation of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> thus to expose the publick Acts of the Kingdom which
were never ridiculous or afraid of the light, but only when some Men

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rned, who are indeed the far least and most inconsiderable part
of the People, otherways why should they so violently now oppose
the Dissolving of this Parliament and the Calling of a new one; since
it is certain that the Humour of the Nation cannot be so well known
by a thin Conv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntion, which was called in an extraordinary Hurry,
in a great Confusion and Fermentation of the People, and which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
with equal Heat and Precipitancy? Others may think, that by
publishing the Names (as is here done) of some few of these good
Men who have suffered, they shall be thereby dangerously exposed to
the Fury and Violence of these Zealots, whose greatest Mercy is
Cruel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y: Indeed there is too much Ground for this Conjecture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:41758:53"/>But our Enemies have put us upon this Necessity, for the late ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
that was given, in some Letters, of the present Persecution of
the Church in <hi>Scotland,</hi> tho it was exactly true in all the Matters of
Fact relating to that Persecution; yet in <hi>England</hi> where these things
are not so well known, some Men being ashamed of these Barbarities,
to which they gave all the Life they could at such a dist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce, have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously
represented by their Tongues and Pens, that account as
altogether False and Fabulous, altho even themselves are but too well
satisfied that it contains sad Truths.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>Mercurius Reformatus,</hi> as he stiles himself, wanting Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements,
and good News from <hi>Ireland</hi> to fill up his Weekly Papers,
stuffs two or three of them with Reflections on that former account of
our Persecution: First, He doubts the Matters of Fact are not true;
and it's something strange, that one who has conversed so intimately
with, and been most of his Life bred up amongst Scotch Fanaticks,
should so much question their natural and customary Practices.
Secondly, He imputes all the Mischief (if, says he, there has been any)
wholly to the Rabble, and wonders that any part of it should be
charged upon the Godly Patriots to whom the Government of that
Kingdom is now intrusted: But now if the Matters of Fact so fully
att<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sted in this Book, and the publick Acts so faithfully transcribed, do
not satisfie him, and those few whom he may have led into these his
willful Mistakes; they must be allowed to doubt on till one come from
the Dead to inform them, if even that can perswade them to believe.</p>
            <p>But Thirdly, which shows that he is indeed but <hi>a new Observator,</hi> he
seems to grant what he would deny, for acknowledging the Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he says, That it was occasioned by the Severities wherewith the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>piscopal Party had treated the Presbyterians in the by-gone Reigns;
as if their <hi>new Gospel</hi> could adopt <hi>Revenge</hi> into a vertue, and as if all
the Punishments inflicted upon Rebels by the State for its own Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
were to be charged only upon the Church, and revenged now
upon the Clergy, the poor helpless Prelates and their Curates.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He's confident that the whole Book is but a malicious
Design to Bespatter the present Government; if the Government be
bespattered when the true account of their open Proceedings is fairly
published to the World, then the faultlyes originally in that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not in the Historian: It's a strange Severity in any Government,
not to suffer Men to groan under Burthens because it imposed them,
and to knock Men in the Head for but clattering those Chains
wherewith the Government Fetters them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:41758:54"/>
Fifthly, He quarrels at the Stile of the Letters, for the Authors, he
says, do no where express any thing of duty or Allegiance to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Governours, but according to <hi>Mercurius</hi>'s own Principles of Policy,
there's time enough for that when they find themselves according to
the Articles of the pretended <hi>Original Contract,</hi> and many fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
secured in their Religion, Liberties and Properties, for now it's
a received Axiom it seems, that Protection and Allegiance are reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal:
Again, He's offended at the Sharpness and Severity which he
discovers in the Expressions, then he runs out in many Rhetorical
Commendations (by way of new reformed Observation) upon Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and recommends it from the great Example of a famous Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholick Prince, whereas at another turn he will not allow
either Popish Prince or People to be capable of the least Moderation,
meerly because they are Papists. It's hard to think why this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
should be so much offended with the Stile of those Letter's; it's
not, I hope, for the Scoticisms in them, for that's a Fault that neither
he nor we can so easily help in our Writing; perhaps he's angry that
he, as a Scotch Doctor, was not entrusted to purge out their sharp
Humour, before they were allowed to take the open Air in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the new Observator upon <hi>March 26.</hi> last, published my Lord
<hi>Crasurd</hi>'s Letter dated <hi>Edinburgh March 16. 1690.</hi> he might have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
that in that Letter my Lord fairly owns, that the Council did
at the same time that they proceeded against Ministers for not praying
for King <hi>William,</hi> take probation of Crimes of another nature also
against them; <hi>tho the Cognisance of them did no way belong to the Council;</hi>
these are the very words of the Letter, for if this be true, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of the Council against the Ministers must be acknowledged
not to have been fair and legal; for the Observator himself who once
pretended to an inferior kind of Practice in the Scots Law; knows I
hope so much, as that no Court ought to hear probation of Crimes
whereof they have not the <hi>Cognizance,</hi> nay the best of Men may be
abused by such Proceedings, for if the Court be not competent, the
Defendants cannot be admitted to object against the Insufficiency of
the Probation, and so the worst things may be proved against the most
innocent People.</p>
            <p>But of all them that have written or spoken against the Account
given in those Lettert, we owe the most Thanks to one downright
true thorough-paced Presbyterian, who writes a Pamphlet against it,
called, <hi>A Brief and true Account of the Sufferings of the Church of</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>occasioned by the Episcopalians since the year 1660.</hi> The Book is
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41758:54"/>
indeed worth the reading because in it the Author has fairly pulled off
that Mask which others more Cunning but less Honest, love to act under.</p>
            <p>I shall not here hazard the turning of the Readers Stomach, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
any of these his most fuls<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

boldly, hoping that if he throw a great deal of Dirt, some of it
may stick; but his Mallce is too large to be confin'd to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and

Laud's <hi>time; and that the Godly Women will with their Folding-stools once
mere arm against them as they did in King</hi> Charles I. <hi>time.</hi> This is a true
Specimen of the Love and Charity that the Scotch Presbyterians have
to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and it's but a little part of that Fire and
Slaughter which our Author breaths out against them: Further yet he
condemns all the orderly Churches in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, for says he. <hi>All
those who use Set Forms of Prayer are Strangers to the Power of Godliness.</hi>
So that neither the Presbyterians themselves in <hi>Holland,</hi> nor in <hi>France,</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:41758:55"/>
no nor in <hi>Geneva,</hi> must escape the Lash of our Scotch Reformers, until
they be purified according to the <hi>Pattern in the Mount, the Covenant
Standard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that I may not rake any longer in this Dunghill, our Author is
as far from Truth in the Points of History he relates, as his manner of
Expression is from the Spirit of Meekness and Charity; and his whole
Discourse is as inconsistent with that, as his beloved Doctrine of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,</hi>
is with the Thirteenth Chapter to the <hi>Romans;</hi> and that they
who shall please next to draw their Pens against us who are already
suffici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntly persecuted by their hands, may find some Matter as well
as Words to fill their Weekly Papers. I shall take leave of them in some
few plain Queries.</p>
            <p>First, Considering the Great Charity which the Scotch Presbyterians
have for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as you have heard; and their Intention
of visiting them again (which the Author has threatned) as they did in
the year 39. when Plate, Jewels, Money, Houshold-goods, Cattle and
all Moveables were declared <hi>Malignants;</hi> and they grew witty in their
Zeal, and told, they came for all their <hi>Goods.</hi> And considering that
they are more Numerous now than they were then; and if they be
establish'd by Law, will be much more Formidable, because all will be
forc'd to joyn with them or suffer their utmost Persecution; for they
have declared <hi>Toleration</hi> to be <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tichristian.</hi> And considering that
their Solemn League and Covenant obliges them to root out Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and never to desist till they have effected it.
I say considering these things, and what they have formerly done upon
the same Principles, Query whether the Settling Presbytery in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
be reconcilable to the Securing Episcopacy in <hi>England?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2ly, Whether even King <hi>William</hi> can secure himself in the Monarchy
against those who formerly refused to Dissolve at the King's Command
in the Assembly of <hi>Glasgow</hi> in the year 38. who preach'd the Subjects
into a furious Rebellion, and to the delivering up the King his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
to be murdered, who by Act of their General Assembly in 48.
declared his <hi>Negative Voice</hi> inconsistent with the Liberty of the Subject,
and who since himself was made King, have risen twice in Arms,
once to the number of some Thousands, who threw out the Episcopal
Ministers by their own Authority (which our Author says, was<note n="*" place="margin">Page 22.</note> 
               <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly
enough</hi>) Beating, Wounding and Tormenting them. Another
time a more formidable number in a hostile manner, made an Address
to the Council, telling them, That they would not lay down their Arms
till the Council had discharged all Judicatures to pronounce any Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41758:55"/>
in Favour of the Episcopal Ministers, which the Council was
forc'd to do. Neither of which Matters of Fact this Author has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered
to answer, tho it was the Subject of the whole Book against
which he wrote. To speak modestly, it seems to have no very good
Aspect to the present Government, and it's but a small A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Inclinations to live peaceable long under it, that they
have voted King <hi>William</hi> out of the Supremacy of the Church,
and that they have now so soon after usurp'd it to themselves,
having already without his leave either ask'd or granted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened
all at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and voted themselves into a free legal ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Assembly, where they draw up daily Instructions for regulating
the Parliament, and meet and adjourn at their own pleasure; and in
their Sermons before the present High Commissi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ner, my Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi>
who is of their own Professi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, they roundly tell his Grace, (if that be
not a Superstitious Arch-prelatical Title) how he must build the <hi>Temple
of the Lord, the Temple</hi> of the Lord, only by such true b'ue <hi>Israelites</hi> as can
well <hi>Edisie,</hi> with the Truel in one Hand and the Sword in another, and
that none of these Samaritans who are addicted to the Superstitions and
Idol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tries of <hi>England,</hi> must be concerned in this <hi>thorough</hi> Reformation.
By those Practices one may easily conjecture why they so scornfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
the Act for establishing Presbytery offered by the late Commissioner.</p>
            <p>King <hi>William</hi> would likewise consider how many Thousands of them
have and do own, That the <hi>Covenant</hi> (which is again voted the Standard
of all pure Religion) is the Fundamental Contract 'twixt God, the King,
and the People. And because K. <hi>C.</hi> 2. broke it, therefore they declared
that he had fallen from his Right to the Crown; and because K. <hi>I.</hi> 2.
never took it, that therefore he had no Right to the Crown, and by
publick Proclamations declared it lawful to kill them, and all who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered
to them; and accordingly killed several of their Souldiers and
Servants in this Quarrel. From all which the Query naturally arises,
What Measure King <hi>William</hi> must expect if he will not take the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
and consequently Swear to root out Episcopacy in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3ly. <hi>Query,</hi> What Loyalty he can expect from those who think him
to be an <hi>Idolater,</hi> as they think all to be who communicate according to
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whose Liturgy they call the Mass in English?</p>
            <p>4ly. Considering their Number in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> how easily
they may carry their Covenant thither, and all its Consequences?</p>
            <p>5ly. What Danger there may be of it, even in <hi>England,</hi> whose
Dissenters have already learned to pray for the Scotch Presbyterians as
their Mother Church?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:41758:56"/>6ly. <hi>Query,</hi> Whether it be fit for King <hi>William</hi> and the Parliament
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to set up those who think it a Sin to grant any <hi>Toleration,</hi>
not only to <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> but to <hi>Anabaptists, Independents,</hi> or any but <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery?</hi>
Which the General Assembly declared to be a Sin, <hi>Anno</hi> 48. and
Address'd to the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> to concur with them in doing
the like.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Whether any Presbyterians, considering their late Practices
and Demands, be more Moderate now than when they formerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
<hi>England</hi> without any Pretence, but their Obligations to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and to reform the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> according to that Model.</p>
