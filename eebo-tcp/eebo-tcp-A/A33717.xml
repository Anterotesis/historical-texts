         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

being beſieged on the north ſide of the town, the River dividing
the Towne, by Sir <hi>Phealam O Neale</hi> and his, company. Sir <hi>Henry

               <hi>Varracaville</hi> was riſing to let flie at him: and ſome others were
as ready as he; but noyſe and tumult ariſing, the Governour of the
Towne came in, and commanded all to be quiet, great muttering
was in the Towne, the next two dayes about it: on the third, the
<pb facs="tcp:63999:4"/>
Prince was ſummoned to the <hi>Hague</hi> to make his appearance before
the States Generall, to make anſwer unto ſuch things, as ſhould by
<hi>Martin Van Trump, Iohn Van Eſterdort</hi> bee laid againſt him. His
Highneſſe tooke ſuch homely dealing bad, and his ſervants worſe:
and his Army worſt of all, who ſummoning a Counſell of warr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to
his Highneſſe lodging; plainely told him, that except he would, he
ſhould not goe, and that they ſhould know, that if they had money
they had ſwords, and that they having command of the one, would
not be long without the other, and that ſhould ſhortly appeare,
hereupon we all, as well ſervants, as Commanders, tooke an oath
unto his Highneſſe, and his ſonne, to ſerve them towards all, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all; which taken upon mature deliberation, it was ordered
by his Highneſſe himſelfe, becauſe of the Queene of great Britains
preſence to go to the Hague, but not to take notice of any ſummons,
and with ſuch a company with him, that hee ſhould not greatly
need to feare them; and here we are in that poſture, not caring for
thoſe that looke ſo big upon us: I truſt the Army is wholly made
for his Highneſſe; not being deſired of their ſervice, but freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
if: We his ſervants, and thoſe of my young Maſters, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to ſee our end ſhortly accompliſhed, or to die every man of
us: I truſt there are no falſe parties in the Army, then before May-day
I hope we ſhall ſee an alteration: and thoſe that hold themſelves
our maſters, ſhall be glad to give us all fitting reſpect: the King of
Denmarke is aſſuredly for it, and hath promiſed both coyne, men,
and ſhipping: <hi>France</hi> hearkens to it, and <hi>Spayne</hi> upon ſome condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
will yeeld aſſiſtance; it is more honourable for a Prince to
be tyed in ſome ceremonious concernments unto a Monarch, then
to any other, either by Democraſticall, or Ariſtocraticall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
more pleaſant tydings I hope to write you, at the Queens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
if not before; for this muſt not be long in doing, and it is
here thought, that ſhe will not ſtay long here, by reaſon that theſe
atchievements cannot long remaine without a period, nor without
ſome bickering, we hold it not fit, ſhee ſhould be eye witneſſe of
it: His Highneſſe, although he is counſelled to ſend away ſpeedily
his young ſonne, and our hope, into <hi>France,</hi> yet he will not, but is
reſolved that hee ſhall partake of his fortune, what ever it be; I
hope we ſhall ſhortly cry, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ivez Oraneye;</hi> and in this expectation,
wishing Heaven to ſay Amen unto it.</p>

               <p>THe 20. of <hi>Decem. ſtilo novo,</hi> arrived at St. <hi>Lucar</hi> the Admirall of
the <hi>Nova Spania's</hi> Fleet, in company of another little ſmall ſhip, they
came in 92. dayes from the <hi>Havana,</hi> and were parted by a ſtorme from
the reſt of the Fleet 12. dayes after their ſetting forth. I ſuppoſe they
may be arriued at <hi>Porto Rico,</hi> for they had moſt of them ſpent their maſts.
The ſaid Admirall was caſt away in the going into St. <hi>Lucar,</hi> of 4.
Millions, which he brought, about 1. ½ million loſt; the whole Fleet worth
10. or a 11. millions, the richeſt that ever was knowne; in the ſaid Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall
was loſt 500. Cheſts of Cuchinell, and a 1000. Cheſts of Indigo,
with a great quantity of other goods. I have Letters by an Aviſo from
Cartagena, dated the 14. of <hi>September,</hi> wherein they adviſe that the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
were ready laden with the ſilver, and would depart thence the 6.
of <hi>October.</hi> The Generall of the Gallions, named <hi>Franciſco Dias Pimien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
had bin formerly in the moneth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> with above 3000. men, and
the leaſt of his Ships in the Iland of <hi>Sancta Catalina,</hi> which he had taken
and carried away all the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and raſed the Forts, wherein they found
600. Negros, much gold and Indigo, ſo that the prize is eſteemed worth
above halfe a million.</p>
               <p>This unexpected, and undeſerved act of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> in ſupplanting
our Nation, will I hope ere long be requited, when as in coole bloud the
<hi>Spaniard</hi> ſhall doe us a miſchiefe, in demoliſhing, and ruining that which
another hath built; and is not able, or will not make uſe of it himſelfe, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting
our more induſtrious people, which endeavoured to doe good both
to the bodies and ſoules of men, and onely to ſhew his greatneſſe, with his
multitude to deſtroy a handfull, and to account that a victory, which is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a credulous trechery: but let him triumph that wins at laſt.</p>
