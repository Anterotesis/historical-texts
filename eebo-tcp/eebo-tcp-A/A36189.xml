            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

HIS PREACHING
Confuted by
HIS PRACTICE.
Sent in a Letter by N. G. to a Friend in
LONDON.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Dear George,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Send thee a Copy of the <hi>Lampoon</hi> upon the
Preſident of <hi>Maudlins,</hi> that you may ſee at
what diſtance his Court-preaching ſtands
with his College-practice. For there he
twitted the Romaniſts with I know not what
Novelties both of Doctrine and Practice cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
brought into the Church; whileſt here,
by a tyrannical and arbitrary way of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he puts down all the good old Cuſtoms
which ſeemed fit to be preſerv'd by his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,
(ſome whereof were as good, and others
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93405:3"/>
better then himſelf) and, under pretence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
hath innovated more in a year and
half, than the Romaniſts had done in many
Ages. What his Innovations are I need not ſay
here in Proſe; thou wilt find in great part they
are told in Verſe: whereof but five or ſix
<hi>Stanza's</hi> were proclaim'd on Act-Monday by
Mr. <hi>Brookes</hi> of <hi>Chriſts-Church,</hi> than whom in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years there has not been a more couragious,
or a more comical, <hi>Terrae-filius.</hi> But his moſt
execrable Novelty was his imperious way of
Proceeding againſt <hi>Harry Yerbury;</hi> who (for all
his Degree, and his Sufferings for the King
1648, his great Ingenuity, and civil Carriage)
was not onely put out of Commons like a Boy,
for I know not what Peccadillo's call'd <hi>Verba
brigoſa;</hi> but caſt out of the College like any
Dog, for but appealing to the <hi>Viſitor</hi> from ſuch
Correction. Now to ſcare our own Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
from preſuming to deal with us, as the
Statute-monger of <hi>Maudlins</hi> dealt with him, be
ſure to publiſh this Ballad as far and wide as
thou canſt, ſo thou be'ſt but ſo honeſt as to huſh
