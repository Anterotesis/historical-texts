            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

sett furthe (according as in
my laste translacion I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mysed)
to the vewe and
sight of all men, the manie
and sundrie misdemeanour and enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
wherwith I can and may most iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
accuse and charge yowe: Yf I had
(I saye) therewith sett furthe your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
then I neaded not to dowbte, but
that your owne doinges, had fullie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
anie true meaning or indifferent
man, to marvaile at your more then sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mefull
outerage, to dowbte your doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
to mystruste your teachinges, and at
the leangth (not without a iuste cause)
to followe the perfecte fayth of Christe
his Catholyke churche. But, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that I dyd vnderstande and see,
thys waye to be bothe sure and readie,
<pb facs="tcp:1919:3"/>
to rase out from mens hartes the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
bloattes, and infection of heresyes,
which in thys our vnhappie tyme, to the
consusion of manye, raygneth with furie
and rage througheout the Realme and
countreys of England: (For, what can
sooner deface vntrue doctrine, then the
detecting of the teachers tyrannous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
peruerse purposse, most lewde lyfe,
and more then past impudent an arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie?)
<note n="*" place="margin">Foxe his martyrs were suche fylthie ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers: as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of theyr nowe prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chers was moued to say this of theim: that onles they recanted their synne at the very stake, he was sure they were in hell.</note> Yet, because the factes of some
of yowe, be so dishonest, so detestable,
and so to be hated, as yf your names were
noted in deede, and that they people dyd
once perceaue yt: ynoughe were yt to
drive yowe (yf you be subiecte to any sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mefastenes)
in desperacion all lewdelye
to leade and end the remnaunte of your
wreached most woefull lyfes. for thys
cause, I wyll omytte at thys tyme your
names. I will not muche speake of your
priuate deedes and offences.</p>
            <p>Onelye in this briefe treatyse will I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle
(lyke a freind) to pulle yowe out
<pb facs="tcp:1919:3"/>
of the clammye claye: wherein your fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
be founde of so long a tyme thus fast.
I will indevour with gentle doinges to
deliuer yowe from thys poreblinde di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease,
which so dreadefullye dothe cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
yowe. And I will trye, whether anye
of yowe recanting from his cursed doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
will in tyme wyselie beware the
euerlasting shame, which otherwise yow
must of necessitie sustayne, to your vtter
and most woorthye defacing foreuer.
For, in case I perceaue yow styll to stand
in your selfe will wanton newe fonde
faythe and waye: I shall be then forced
(for some further admonicion vnto the
people) to sett furthe your names, your
habitacions, the faultes and haynous cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
wherewyth I wyll but all truelye ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
yowe, and also the tyme, the place,
and the personnes, which shall make for
the manifest testimoniall and proofe of
the trothe: which thing (I am sure) yowe
wolde be right sorye to see in printe, and
<pb facs="tcp:1919:4"/>
so published to your perpetuall deserued
reproache. But, there be of yowe perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture,
which do litle thinke, that I can
be pryevie to anye poincte of your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
lyfe and behaviour: or at the leaste
doe suppose yt impossible, that I should
haue the full vnderstanding of all your
vnbrydeled beastlynes and follye. In dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
althoughe that muche of your illau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
lyfe must needes be vnto mee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen:
Yeat, so muche thereof I am
pryevie vnto, as (truste vnto yt) ys hable
to move and bring anye honest harted
man, to abhorre and myslyke all your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencious,
lewde, and ouerstreached lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
And yf you wyll knowe, howe I cam
vnto the knowlaige thereof: yt was by
theym of your owne syde, of your owne
sectes, counsaill, and profession, it was
they which wroughte you this woe, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terered
you outerage, declared your cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailles,
and betrayde the whole effecte of
your vngodlye tryckes and noughtynes.
<pb facs="tcp:1919:4"/>
Now then, yf that vnto me (whoe sholde
knowe least the fruicte of your long la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
for licencious libertie) suche and
so muche of your disordered dealinges is
made manifest and detected: how thinke
you of others? how muche knoweth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men? what say you vnto those which
dwell in the other parties of Englande?
do not they likewyse perceaue the vnlau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
lyuing of your brethern there? yeas
no dowbte. For whether you goe or ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
trauaill or reast, what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie soeuer
you keepe, you shall here nothing but of
the noughtynes of these newe Ministers.
All folkes will straight fall to complayne
on the ryotte, ambicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, auarice, and meere
cruell desyre of Ministers. so that yf you
whiche be Ministers woulde trauayll by
lande or by sea, your selves sholde surelie
here your owne synfull trespasses all tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
tolde and vttered. For, whereas some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
men trauayling accustomed by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of hystories and tales, to auoyde the
<pb facs="tcp:1919:5"/>
wearinesse of theyr long wayes and iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney:
in these dayes they haue none other
newes, nor anye other historie, then the
telling of the madde touches of Minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
in so muche, that whether he be a
childe, a yong man, of middle age, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged:
he is sure able to saye, that this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
or that Minister, hathe commytted
thys vyle deede, or that, and one michie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feous
facte, or an other. Moue further to
anye man the misfortune and calamitye
of this present age, wherein, if wee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
the trothe, we doe rather lynger then
lyue, expresse the imperfection of men,
complaine vpon the wante of vnitie and
peace, sett furthe the fayle and decaye of
charitie, honest loue, and true freindship,
tell the vntrothe, vnfaythefulnes, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
shiftes now vsed, yea, bewraye
the whole woe of thys wreached and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
tyme: And then yf you inquire
for the cause of all suche our vncompfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
estate, yt wilbe aunswered, that this
<pb facs="tcp:1919:5"/>
wrye wicked and false religion hathe fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
vs in the myddest of all these mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
that these here &amp; there newe folyshe
professed opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s haue imprisoned vs in
suche sundrie puddells of painefull dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse,
and that the newe fatched from
<hi>Geneua</hi> faith hath mingled our quiete es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
<hi>&amp;</hi> safetie, with these sought out sectes
of warre, rebellion, schismes, sedicion, and
disobedience. Ys such therefore (o prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers)
the credyte, which you haue pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased?
and is suche the shamefull lowse
lyfe, whiche your preaching vnperfecte
maintayneth? Yea, yea, suche is the holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of all your whole professed protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancie,
and suche is the shame, which of
necessytie must ensue and followe you
for the same. This your fayned religion
is not yet full seauen yeares of age, and
for all that, see what a defourmed babe
alreadie it is, beholde what wickednes yt
committeh, and marke what detestable
doinges yt practyzeth. yt perswadeth the
<pb facs="tcp:1919:6"/>
people against theyr Prince, the youthe
against their parentes, seruantes against
their superiours and maisters, one realme
against an other, and whole Chrysten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
against Christe. But in thys, our
made Ministers can reioyce and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe,
tearming yt most vngodlye, to be
the Ghospell: whereas in deede, there
neaded no better argument to proue yt
to be, as yt ys, high mynded pestiferous
pleasante heresye: then the readynes of
selfewill youthe, and delicate vnpainefull
personnes to runne so rashelie to imbrace
yt: for from labour vnto luste, from prayer
vnto contempte and pryde, and from fas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vnto lowse libertie and feasting, wee
see the peruerse nature of man to be ouer
prone and reade. I remember the talke
(as it is written) betwene Socrates the
famous philosophier and <hi>Theodota</hi> the
bewtiefull queane, she tolde hym that she
was able at anye tyme to allure vnto her
al his schollers <hi>&amp;</hi> stude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes in philosophie:
<pb facs="tcp:1919:6"/>
affirming, that <hi>Socrates</hi> colde not wythe
all his learning, perswade anie one of her
companions and louers vnto hym. It is
truthe, sayd Socrates, <hi>&amp;</hi> no meruail, seing
thowe doest drawe theym in a downe
hyll pathe into pleasure: and I compell
theym to clyme vnto vertue, wherevnto
the waye and clyming is highe and full of
difficultie in likewise what wonder is it,
yf manie a thowsande doe nowe thicke
and threefolde, fall from vertue the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the Catholyke churche, into vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
the verye whyrlepoole of the protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of heretykes? The Apostle of Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste
S. Pieter,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2.</note> dyd hym selfe long sythence,
in most playne woordes expresse the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
saing: <hi>Superba enim vanitatis loquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
pelliciunt in desideriis carnis luxuriae, eos
qui paululum effugiunt, qui in errore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersantur:
libertatem illis promittentes, cùm
ipsi serui sint corruptionis, &amp;c.</hi> that ys to say,
For when they haue spoken the swelling
wordes of vanitie, they beguyle throughe
<pb facs="tcp:1919:7"/>
wanto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, throughe the lustes of the flea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>she,
theym whiche were cleane eskaped:
but now are wrapped in errours, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myse
theym libertie, and are theym selfes
the bonde seruantes of corrupcion, &amp;c.
So nowe in these later dayes, when yowe
(which vsurpe preaching) haue prated
and sett furthe your owne foolish and (as
God doth knowe) inconstante fancies:
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yowe prouoke and allure others into

offering theym the like fruicion
of the luste of the filthie fleashe. And pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mysing
vnto Priestes, Moonkes, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
others, whoe sometimes lyued in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie
<hi>&amp;</hi> godlines, an open gate into all
vngodlie desire and vanitie: and that in
suche wyse, as what poore Prieste soeuer
dothe at this tyme lyue within the lurche
of your iniunctions and tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nie, the same
ys not compted honest zelous, nor ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
in faythe, onles he be clogged with
a queane, to carie him all headlong into
<pb facs="tcp:1919:7"/>
hell. So that the poore man, which lyued
of a long time in chastitie and perfection,
is nowe compelled to compasse the loue
of some light damosell, to leade with her
a loytering detestable lyfe, and so to byd
farewell vnto all his former faythe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myse,
and fidelitie. Wherefore, may wee
not most iustlie with Seneca saye? <hi>Vincit
sanctos dira libido.</hi> Vengible or cruell luste
ouercommeth the holye men. Forther,
may wee not adiudge by this oure tyme,
the sayng of Marcus Antoninus Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of the Romaines, to be all ryghtlie
spoken for truthe? whoe alleaged it ouer
harde for anye man, hauing immoderate
libertie, to rule the brydell and rayne of
his raging appetites and lustes. But here
some of yowe will saye, Why? and were
not manie of the Priest yuell in the olde
tyme? Admytte (yf anie to your knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laige
were) some so to be, and yet, that
shall make nothing to mayntayne your
noughtines. For in those dayes to punishe
<pb facs="tcp:1919:8"/>
suche lewde lyuers as yowe, there were
streight and laudable lawes established, as
the bookes thereof, yf you wolde impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentlie
denye yt, can yet testifie. So that
feare then forced fowle lyfe to flye into
corners, and to forsake the face of the strea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes
and howses: but nowe puritie of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
is cleane putte awaye, chastitie is
shaken in sunder, the lawes to punish lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie
is layde vnder foote, vertue is cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
but a varlat, inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinencie is creapte
vp and mayntayned in maried Moonkes,
Priestes, and Ministers howses. Also then
the spiritualtie were spirituall and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast,
now they be laye men and shameles.
Then they were learned and laudablie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
in liberall sciences, nowe they are
rude vnlearned, and for the most parte
but poore labourers of handie craftes.
Then they were deuoute and diuines, but
nowe they haue neyther deuocion nor di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uinitie.
Yowe your selfes (o Ministers)
doe knowe, that the most parte of youe
<pb facs="tcp:1919:8"/>
be onlie throughe meere pouertie thus
compelled to putt your selfes so rashelie
in these disordered orders, &amp; youe which
haue consumed and riotouselie wasted
your welthe and goodes, are nowe glad
to professe a peruerse doctrine, thereby
to drawe into some abilitie for to wade
with the worlde agayne. Yf that in anie
paryshe (a pietiefull thing to heare) there
was any pastthrifte and rashe mate which
colde but reade, such an vnrulie runnea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
is nowe, not onlye, in the churche a
reader, but also (which thing passeth all
impudencie) a preacher and a pulpitte
possessor in the holye howse of God.
(I meane in the howse which once was
holye, and rightlie reuerenced throughe
out the Realme of England, but nowe
defaced, and against all godlynes propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.)
I knowe my selfe suche as, hauing
forsaken theyr handieworke and former
trade of lyuing, haue afterwardes labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to reade, that then they might be Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
<pb facs="tcp:1919:9"/>
               <hi>&amp;</hi> readers. I know theym who, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
some skyll in reading, haue rashelie
forsaken their maisters seruices, <hi>&amp;</hi> so that
haue not onelye sought thus vnorderlie
for orders, but also which haue obtayned
the same. I know theym who, (being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuered
out of the Bushoppes pryson,
and whose handes, before the temporall
Iudge, of the yron and fyre haue suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlye
fealte.) haue notwithstanding
strayght passed into the next Diocesse,
and there desyryng orders, were furthe

            <p>Agayne, yf you marke the yong sorte of
newe made Ministers, you shall fynde in
theym suche follye and pryde, suche wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnes
and wantonnes, that woefull yt is
to heare yt. they be in theyr attyre and
apparaill so rooffed, welted, iagged and
stytched, as meeter to be ministrels then
of the ministery. These doe no sooner at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
this one newe onelye order, but

then busylie seeke they for some bassing

a varlat: they passe not, this is the ende
of theyr studie, this is it which they seeke,
and this is theyr <hi>summum bonum,</hi> theyr

grauest fathers and newe named Bushop<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pes
haue bene,<note place="margin">these newe Bushop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes were the basyste sorte of the whole cleargie.</note> and you shall fynde, that
they were the inferiour sorte of the whole
cleargie, that they were for theyr learning
meater to be compared with the laitie,
then with the learned: that they were the
most wantonne lyuers (as by theyr light,
vnaduised, and vnluckie made maraiges
appeareth) amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest the spiritualtie: that
they were those, for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the whose clear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gie
were accused of incontinencie, that
they were but the riffe raffe amongest the
religious: that they were but truantes in
comparison of the true Catholyke tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers:
that they were the verye worste of
<pb facs="tcp:1919:10"/>
all those which professed Priestehoode &amp;
sanctitie, and that they were but the verye
Dregges of the Diuines and Doctors of
our dayes. Beholde of them some, who
hauing lyued this long tyme without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
matching in mariage, doe nowe in
theyr olde age fall to suche follye and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
as theyr meere madde doinges must
well declare, what kinde of fayth they see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke

of theyr Bushopes, and they be of theyr
newe godlie, deuoute, and (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantes
can call theym) most graue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
But is it grauitie for a Bushop with

wanto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, and to wade in loue with a light

whom he hathe made suche hast to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye?
I shall not neede to trouble your with
hys name, for the cyttie and countrey doe
well knowe yt. Yet, yf anye farre dweller

aswell as the best a mocke Bushoppe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

And is it also grauitie, for one taken to be
the profoundest clearke of theyr compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye,
who lead hys lyfe hethervnto in stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
and (as some doe thinke) in chastitie,
nowe hauing throughe heresie heaped to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether
great store of welthe in a Bushop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryke,
to be as busye in wantonnes as the

at his studie doore, and so in the myddest
of his newe godlynes to marye? Is this a
signe that they seeke for the Kingdome
of God? dothe thys proue that they pray,
<pb facs="tcp:1919:11"/>
fast, mourne, and lament for theyr offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?
shall wee gather by this, that they be
deuoute, holye, chaste, sighing, and soro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the fathers of this late framed fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the,

readie to be receaued into hys graue, that
yet he wolde greadelye goe into the worl<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de

is the perfection, that springeth from thys
vnperfecte faythe, which theyr owne fan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cies,

I doe vrge hym the more in this, for
that his owne freindes haue founde faulte

Is it proper to his protestancie, or belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging

what then? It was the spirite that moued
hym. O spightefull spirite, cursed, detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and a most daungerous enemye vnto
the best parte and porcion of man. This
spirite is he, which the Poêtes named <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pido,</hi>
and yowe the Englishe Ministers will

<pb facs="tcp:1919:13"/>
these men wold haue vs to defye our fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refathers,

ceasing in theyr prating sermones most
vngodlye and vnnaturallye to saye, our

Here I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not suffer, but must neade saye,
O you beastes vnnatural,<note place="margin">Who can write to ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che varla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes?</note> why will you to

who dyed in the faythe and true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

so peruerselye pronounce thys shameles
sentence against so manie thowsandes of
good men, of Christian vertous and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
Kinges? of whome we may surelye
with the Prophete saye: <hi>In te sperauerunt
patres nostri: sperauerunt, &amp; liberasti eos.
Ad te clamauerunt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 21.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; salui facti sunt: in te

In thee haue our fathers trusted: in thee

them. Vnto the haue they cryede, and
they are made safe: in the they haue trus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb facs="tcp:1919:13"/>
and are not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>founded. I reade, that
noble Solon one of the. vij. wyse men of
Grece, being on a tyme demaunded: why
he had not established lawes, to punishe
those which had beaten theyr fathers. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
(saythe he) I adiudged not anye
suche to be, You may hereby see, howe
that Solon thought yt impossible, that
anye should be so pastgrace as hys father
to beate or in anye wyse to greve.</p>
            <p>But our newe noughtie false preachers
will not sticke so to storme against theyr
fathers:<note place="margin">We are vnnatural children, yf we forsake not the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

lawes, to punishe suche lewde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall

then vnnatural and lewde, to alleage that
their forefathers and oures, that the Sain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes,

in tormentes in hell? whiche thyng
they be eyther dryven to affirme: or els to
<pb facs="tcp:1919:14"/>
deface the chiefest poinctes of their new
bastardlie paynted fayth. For it is against
theyr fancied faythe to mayntayne, that
anie man dyeng in the belefe of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholyke
churche (as all our forefathers
haue done) can obtayne heaven, or anye
saluacion of soule. Wherefore (o Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testante)
if anie pietie be planted in thy

so many, as these monstrous Ministers be
rulers ouer, yf anye grace and mercy may
move thee, thowe wilte all hartelie lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
the loasse and danger, which the people
of Christe be in, And also if there be but
one iote of anye gentlenes or iustice in
thyne harte, thowe wilte haue some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie
to deale withe and to iudge
these thinges. Playe therefore nowe the
worthie parte of <hi>Pericles</hi> the noble and
valiaunte Captayne of the Athenienses,
vse here his iustice, and with hym saye,
<hi>Oportet me amicis accommodare, sed vsque

frendes, the Protestantes, saving my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
Let nowe thy conscience cause
in the some consideracion of honestie,
and then no dowbte the pleasante pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous
doctrine of heresye must needes
displease thee: whiche doctrine the elder
that yt ys, the more rotten and fylthie
fruicte yt bearethe. Yt ys a doctrine by
the dyvel devised to snare and delude the
corrupte companie of youthe and others,
who willingelie wold walke in the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large,
wicked, <hi>&amp;</hi> pleasaunte way of theyr
most poysoned appetites. For as Sathan
sometymes on the highe mountayne and
hyll toppe, dyd assaye to tempte our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
Christe: saing, (after that he had
shewed hym the whole dominion of the

me, &amp;c.</hi> that is, All these things will
I give the, if thow wilte falle downe and
worshipp me, &amp;c. So now in this valey or
dale of miserie, he mischievouselye with
the lyke intycementes compasseth, also to
<pb facs="tcp:1919:15"/>
tempte the Christians, saing: The pompe
of the world, the freedome of the fleashe,
riches, power, welthe, wyves, Bushoppry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
deanries, beneficies, and authoritie: al
these thinges wil I give you, if you imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
and sett furthe my faythe, fancie, and

Well, a great companie of good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
have forsaken al these baytes, Bushop
prykes, benefices, welthe and wyves, and
they have sayd with our Sauiour Christ,
<hi>Abi Sathana,</hi> auoyde Sathan. But a fewe
peruerse Englishe preachers, they wyll
praye him to make that offer agayn, and
then more heede shall they give vnto his

you shal herein earthe sustayne most wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thye
infamye and shame for your offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and in hell a iuste plague and punis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
for the same.</p>
            <p>Here haue I passed ouer briefelye some
piece of your peruerse practize and beha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uiour,
&amp; that the more to make you myn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>defull
of your vngodly estate and degree,
wherin I haue yeat vsed such modestie, as
willinglye I named not one of you. but
now this cometh last into my mynde, that
manye of you beholding this booke, will
bragginglie saye: If that he cold name vs,
he wolde. hereat I staye, and doe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
dowbte, whether it were best to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynne
of newe or not, and of freashe to
sett furthe your names, fylthie factes and
<pb facs="tcp:1919:16"/>
dwellinges. Well, you shall see that I can
doe it, and yeat will not: hoping that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
you haue forsaken this your fonde fayth,
you may leade a godlie lyfe agayne. But
to preuent your bragg, you dryue me to
vtter the doinges of one or twoe for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
sake: whose proper names notwith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>standyng
I will (according vnto my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mysse)
omitte. There is one nowe a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
who, being maried, and his wyfe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in the towne fyue or six myles westwarde
from London, was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuertheles by a
gentle ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with an other mans wyfe, and
so brought before the iustice, who bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
hym to appeare before M. Grindall,<note place="margin">they leaue theym vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished: least yt sholde els deface their doctrine.</note> at
whose handes he receaued none other pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be banished out of his dio<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cesse.
This perfect Preacher now dwelleth
foure myles fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Windsor: where he hathe
gotten for his excellent vertue a vicarage.
There is an other, who (according vnto
the saing of <hi>Theodorus</hi> the Atheman) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued
diuinitie in his right hande: but
<pb facs="tcp:1919:17"/>
which delyuereth it vnto the people agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
with the leafte. I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not well leaue out
his name, &amp; yet I am lothe to name hym.
But,<note place="margin">Chrsman is sent to preache this newe Ghospell into the countrey / where he is not knowen, which is a shifte now commonly vsed.</note> inquire for the Archedeaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of West
mynster, learne the cause of his departure
thence, aske with what fauour the lawes
went forwarde, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he eskaped the carte,
which he had deserued, for ventring lyke
a <hi>Hardye man</hi> so farre with <hi>Venus.</hi> Thus,
being lothe further towade with your faul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes,
onles I be by you pricked and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
I wishe vnto yowe suche harte, as may
hate all haynous pleasau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te heresies, vnto
the people suche perfection and pure iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes,
as maye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne your vngodlie
shameles sermones: wherein yow co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passe
most craftelie to kyll &amp; slea theyr soules,
And I wishe finallie vnto vs all, perfecte
vnitie, charitie, and true loue, that at the
leangth wee maye like breathren lyue
in the euerlasting ioye which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
shall ende. Amen.</p>
