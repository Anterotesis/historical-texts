            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>'TIS known to all who have been any conſiderable time in <hi>Italy,</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> how <hi>Opera</hi>'s are eſteem'd among 'em. That <hi>France</hi> borrow'd what ſhe has from <hi>Italy,</hi> is evident from the <hi>Andromede</hi> and <hi>Toiſon D'or,</hi> of Monſieur <hi>Corneille,</hi> which are the firſt in the kind they ever had, on their publick Theaters; they being not perfect <hi>Opera</hi>'s, but Tragedies, with Singing, Dancing, and Machines interwoven with 'em, after the manner of an Opera. They gave 'em a taſt firſt, to try their Palats, that they might the better Judge whether in time they would be able to digeſt an entire <hi>Opera.</hi> And Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> (that great Encourager of Arts and Learning) introduced 'em firſt at his own Expence, as I have been informed amongst 'em.</p>
            <p>What encouragement Seignior <hi>Baptiſt Luly</hi> had from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent King of <hi>France,</hi> is well known; they being firſt ſet out at his own Expence; and all the Ornaments given by the King, for the Entertainment of the People. In <hi>Italy,</hi> eſpecially at <hi>Venice,</hi> where <hi>Opera</hi>'s have the greateſt Reputation, and where they have 'em e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Carnival, the Noble <hi>Venetians</hi> ſet 'em out at their own coſt. And what a Confluence of People the fame of 'em draw from all parts of <hi>Italy</hi> to the great profit of that City, is well known to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one who has ſpent a Carnival there. And many of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Gentry are ſenſible what advantage <hi>Paris</hi> receives, by the great number of Strangers which frequent the <hi>Opera</hi>'s three days in a Week, throughout the Year. If therefore an <hi>Opera</hi> were eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here, by the Favour of the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>England;</hi> I may modeſtly conclude it would be ſome advantage to <hi>London,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what a Sum we muſt Yearly lay out among Tradeſmen for the fitting out ſo great a work.</p>
            <p>That Sir <hi>William Davenant</hi>'s Siege of <hi>Rhodes</hi> was the firſt <hi>Opera</hi> we ever had in <hi>England,</hi> no Man can deny; and is indeed a perfect <hi>Opera:</hi> there being this difference only between an <hi>Opera</hi> and a Tragedy; that the one is a Story ſung with proper Action, the other ſpoken. And he muſt be a very ignorant Player, who knows not there is a Muſical Cadence in ſpeaking; and that a Man
<pb facs="tcp:64474:3"/>
may as well ſpeak out of Tune, as ſing out of Tune. And though few are ſo nice to examine this, yet all are pleas'd when they hear it juſtly perform'd. 'Tis true, the Siege of <hi>Rhodes</hi> wanted the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of Machines, which they value themſelves ſo much upon in <hi>Italy.</hi> And the Dancing which they have in ſuch perfection in <hi>France.</hi> That he deſign'd this, if his firſt attempt met with the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it deſerv'd, will appear from theſe Lines in his Prologue.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>But many Travellers here, as Judges, come</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>From</hi> Paris, Florence, Venice, <hi>and from</hi> Rome.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Who will deſcribe, when any Scene we draw,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>By each of ours, all that they ever ſaw.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Thoſe praiſing for extenſive breadth and height,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And inward diſtance to deceive the ſight.—</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <p>And a little after—</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Ah Mony, Mony! if the Wits would dreſs</l>
               <l>With Ornaments the preſent face of Peace:</l>
               <l>And to our Poet half that Treaſure ſpare,</l>
               <l>Which Faction gets from Fools to nouriſh War.</l>
               <l>Then his contracted Scenes ſhould wider be,</l>
               <l>And move by greater Engines; till you ſee</l>
               <l>(While you ſecurely ſit) fierce Armies meer,</l>
               <l>And raging Seas diſperſe a fighting Fleet.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>That a few private Perſons ſhould venture on ſo expenſive a Work as an <hi>Opera,</hi> when none but Princes, or States exhibit 'em abroad, I hope is no Diſhonour to our Nation: And I dare affirm, if we had half the Encouragement in <hi>England,</hi> that they have in other Countries, you might in a ſhort time have as good Dancers in <hi>England</hi> as they have in <hi>France,</hi> though I deſpair of ever having as good Voices among us, as they have in <hi>Italy.</hi> Theſe are the two great things which Travellers ſay we are moſt deficient in. If this happens to pleaſe, we cannot reaſonably propoſe to our ſelves any great advantage, conſidering the mighty Charge in ſetting it out, and the extraordinary expence that attends it every day 'tis repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. If it deſerves their Favour? if they are ſatisfied we ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture boldly, doing all we can to pleaſe 'em? We hope the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are too generous not to encourage ſo great an undertaking.</p>
