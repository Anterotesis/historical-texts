            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

WALTER
LORD BISHOP OF
WINCHESTER,
Prelate of the Noble order
of the GARTER, my
singular good Lord
and Patron.</head>
            <head type="sub">Right reverend Father in God,
and my very singular good Lord.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>ETting aside
more serious
studies, and
being desirous
to recreate my
selfe with some books of
<pb facs="tcp:24022:3"/>
medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, it was my good hap
to meet with this litle tract
<hi>Of the Imitation of Christ:</hi>
And having lookt over
some of it, I began to admire
both the plainnesse and the
pythinesse of it; being so
well fitted to the capacity
of the ignorant, and yet not
unworthy the perusall of the
learned, insomuch that I
finde it to be true by mine
own experience, that the
high co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendations so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
have given of it, is not
without just cause. For I
must confesse to the glory
of God and mine own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
that I have profited
more in the course of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
by the perusall of
<pb facs="tcp:24022:3"/>
this one small book of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
then by turning over
many volumes of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies.
For I found in it
great motives to selfe-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
humility, obedience and
devotion, to humility in our
selves, to obedience towards
superiors, to devotion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God. I then began
to enquire whether it were
translated or no, and I finde
it is translated into all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
and into english se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
times, yet could none
of these altogether please
me; for I perceaved some of
them to stick too close to
the letter, &amp; others fly too
farre off: I have therefore
taken a litle paines to fit it
<pb facs="tcp:24022:4"/>
to our own language and
yet not leave the author too
much. And because the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
thereof was too much
addicted to one side, I made
bold to leave out that which
might offend any Christian
palate, and have endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that it should look with
an equall and unpartiall eye
upon all good Christians.
And it were to be wished
that we had more bookes in
this kind, and that we did
especially apply our selves
to such kinde of books; for
men now adaies are immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratly
wedded to their
own opinions, they labour
to dispute well, not to live
well, and delight more in
<pb facs="tcp:24022:4"/>
books of controversy to
strengthen them on that side
they are, then in books of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
to teach them what
each good Christian should
be.</p>
            <p>So that the admonition
of the Apostle was never
more seasonable then now,
<hi>Let your moderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be known
unto all men. Phil.</hi> 4. 5. That
therefore others may be the
better encouraged to peruse
this so plaine and profitable
a booke, I have presumed to
shelter it under your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
gracious protection.
And to whom could I more
fitly dedicate so pious a
worke then to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
in whom humility pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb facs="tcp:24022:5"/>
and devotion, joyned
with a singular temper and
moderation are so well met
together. The assured con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of all these doth give
great assurance, that you
will favourably accept of
the weak endeavours of</p>

this pious worke of

good Christian Reader whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thou art, and wheresoever
thou dwellest; I say wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thou dwellest, for nowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies
it is an hard matter to find
a good Christian: the Prophet
bid them run to &amp; fro, through
the streets of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and
seeke in the broad places there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
if they could finde a man, <hi>Ier.</hi>
5. 1. They were not so much
troubled to find out a man as we
<pb facs="tcp:24022:6"/>
shall be to find out a Christian.
We so busie our selves about
Controversies, that we forget
to be good Christians. There
was a time indeed when the
name was first given at <hi>Antioch,
Act.</hi> 11. 26. that it was then
well set by; but this lasted not
long, for presently after they
fell a sideing amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and one cryed I am of
<hi>Paul,</hi> another I am of <hi>Apollos,</hi>
and another I am of <hi>Cephas,</hi> and
another I am of <hi>Christ,</hi> and
much adoe had S. <hi>Paul 1. Cor.</hi>
1. 12. to appease these factions:
for presently after they fell to
them againe, and have so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
yea and encreased in them
even unto this day. But Christ
is not divided, saith the same A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
neither is this to imitate
Christ the God of love and
peace, who loved us when we
<pb facs="tcp:24022:6"/>
were his enemies; and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
makes a good inference of
imitation upon it. 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4. 11.
<hi>Beloved, if God so loved us we
ought also to love one another:</hi>
Nay as though there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else required of a good
Christian, and a follower of
Christ, our saviour saith, <hi>Ioh. 13.
15. by this shall all men know
you are my disciples, if you have
love one to another.</hi> Seeing then
this is the proper and peculiar
badge and cognisance of a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Christ to love his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
disciples, what preface
would be fitter here, then an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction
to all Christians to be
in peace and charity one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
            <p>But alas how unwelcome a
taske is it, to entreat of peace
and charity! For he that goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to part a fray, in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb facs="tcp:24022:7"/>
will have blowes on both
sides, especially where the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites
&amp; combatants are fierce
and violent, he that is eager on
any one side shall be sure to finde
some fast friends, but he that
bewaileth the miserable distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the whole, and doth but
set a foote forward to make up
the breach, will finde few to
take his part, but shall be sure to
have many about his eares: And
therefore we may observe that
presently after our Saviour had
said, <hi>Blessed are the peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
Mat.</hi> 5. 9. 10. he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly
addeth, <hi>Blessed are they that
are persecuted for righteousnesse
sake:</hi> knowing well enough that
if a man will undertake to be a
peacemaker, he must presently
prepare to suffer persecution,
and I know none greater then
that of peace-makers in religion
<pb facs="tcp:24022:7"/>
for they suffer on all sides, either
by sharpe and bitter words, or
by scoffing &amp; jeering speeches.
For although the hot-spurres of
these times be at deadly fewde
and bitter enmity one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
yet will they like <hi>Herod</hi>
and <hi>Pilate,</hi> joyne together and
muster up their forces against
those who labour any kind of
pacification and desire to be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
in the land. <hi>Wee is me</hi> (saith
<hi>David Ps. 120. 4. 5 6. that I am
constrained to dwell with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sech,
and to have mine habitation
amongst the tents Kedar: my
soule hath long dwelt among
them, that be enemies unto peace.
I labour for peace but whn I speak
unto them thereof, they make
them ready to Battell.</hi> Never
could the pious and peaceable
Christian more truly cry out
then now, <hi>My mothers Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb facs="tcp:24022:8"/>
were angry with me. Cant.</hi>
1. 5. A strange speech to call
them <hi>Mothers children:</hi> had it
not been a more easy &amp; familiar
way to say my Brethren or my
Sisters were angry with me (for
so they must be, if they were
her Mothers Children) why
then doth she make such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
speech of it, <hi>My mothers
children were angry with me.</hi>
True indeed though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
choose but be her brethren,
(as being her Mothers children)
yet she doth not, she dares not
call them brethren, for they
will not acknowledge it, they
hate the name of brethren, and
make themselves professed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and therefore she is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to leave out this loving and
affectionate compellation of
brethren, and say in a kinde of
strange phrase, <hi>My mothers chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb facs="tcp:24022:8"/>
were angry with me.</hi> Yet
should no man be discouraged,
from performing so worthy a
duty, for though there be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

that attends upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers
here, yet is there a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
promised them hereafter.
And seeing our blessed Lord and
Master Christ Iesus, when he
was about to leave his Apostles
and Disciples, he left unto them
this golden legacy: <hi>Ioh. 14. 27.
Peace I leave with you, my peace
I give unto you,</hi> O how well
would it become us his Priests
to be men of peace, to write for
the peace of <hi>Ierusalem, to pray
for the peace of Ierusalem, for
they shall prosper that love it.
Psal.</hi> 122. 6.</p>
            <p>I will begin this exhortation
unto peace and Charity, from
that common name which we
all beare in that we are called
<pb facs="tcp:24022:9"/>
Christians, and doe all pretend
to imitate Christ in our doctrine
and practice. There was a time
indeed when this name was
much taken notice of and great
danger for any man to owne it,
when they had no other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
then, nor any other cause
of their cruell persecutions, but
to heare a man confesse <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus
sum,</hi> I am a Christian: But
when these stormes were
blown over, and the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be in peace, this name
of Christian was not so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.
And yet methinks the
very name of Christian is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
to be contemned, for,
unlesse I am deceived whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hath but this appellation
may challenge a brotherhood
with me, for in Scripture I find
a brother and a Christian to be
the very same, so that whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb facs="tcp:24022:9"/>
is a Christian will necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be my brother. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 12.
13. <hi>If any brother hath a wife,</hi>
saith the Apostle, <hi>that believeth
not, and she be pleased to dwell
with him, let him not put her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
and if the woman hath an
husband which believeth not, if
he be pleased to dwell with her, let
her not leave him: But if the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
depart let him depart,
a brother or a sister is not in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
in such cases.</hi> Where the
Apostle plainly sheweth that a
brother and a sister are such as
are Christians and opposite only
to Infidels and unbelievers. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ought we to take that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
of Saint <hi>Paul 1. Pet.</hi> 2.
17. when he saith <hi>love the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood,</hi>
in any narrower sense,
but that we should love every
one that is a Christian, not only
because he agreeth with me in
<pb facs="tcp:24022:10"/>
some opinions concerning reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
but I ought to love him in
that respect he is a Christian,
and professeth Christ crucified.
Neither ought we to love him
thus with an ordinary kinde of
love, in wishing him well and
doing him good, for so we ought
to love and doe good to all, but
there is a more strict tie of love
that lies upon us Christians one
to another; and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Apostle wisheth us
<hi>to doe good to all men, yet especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to the houshold of faith, Gal.</hi>
6, 10. that is, to such as be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
            <p>Were this precept of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
practised as it ought to be,
there would not be so much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitablenesse,
nor peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
so much dissention amongst
Christians. Why can wee not
consider one another as united
<pb facs="tcp:24022:10"/>
in this blessed name of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi>
and set aside for a time those
names of faction and division<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
why should wee not rejoyce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while
in those things wherein
we agree, and not alwaies be
wrangling about those things
wherein wee differ? Of what
moment those opinions are
wherein we disagree I am not
able to determine; this I dare
be bold to say, that the points
wherein we are friends are of
farre greater consequence, then
those are wherein wee fall out.
And yet we so eagerly contend
one with another, and damne
each other to the pit of hell, as
though our differences were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
important, &amp; our agreement
not worth the talking of. For
my part I should be loath to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
any visible Christian
Church from all hopes of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:24022:11"/>
and if I must needs offend,
I had rather give account to a
mercifull God for too much
mildnesse and Charity, then too
much fiercenesse and severity:
yet I hope to make it appeare
that my opinion of Charity shall
not exceed the bounds of verity.</p>
            <p>A chiefe cause of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of these dissentions is,
that men minde not so much the
common cause of Christianity,
as their own particular engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
nor stndy how they may
agree one with another, as how
to uphold the side they are on:
whereas would they set aside
prejudice and partiality and cast
an equall eye upon all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
they would not spye so
many faults abroad, and so few
at home, but would freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
there might bee greater
concord amongst Christians then
<pb facs="tcp:24022:11"/>
now there is. No other unity
doe I labour for at this time but
that of charity, that Christians
would not for some differences
in opinion, pronounce such an
heavy sentence upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as is that of Damnation. If
God should deale with us as we
deale with one another, if he
should censure us all, as we cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
one another, I know not
who should be saved: The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist
damning the Protestant, and
some among us the Papists, and
both of them any other that shall
differ from them both. But my
hope is, and my hearty prayer
to God shall be, that he would
be more mercifull to all these
then they are one to another.
When I consider with my selfe
the manifold distractio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
about Religion, and the
great fiercenes and violence u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb facs="tcp:24022:12"/>
on all sides, every one think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his own opinion truest, and
consequently damning all others
that differ from him, I could
not but call to minde that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
of our blessed Saviour
<hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 12. concerning these
latter and worser times, <hi>Because
iniquity shall abound</hi> (saith he)
<hi>the love of many shall waxe cold:</hi>
for although charity of it selfe
be of a hot and diffusive nature,
yet now clean contrary to the
nature of it, it is in most men
grown cold; it being the nature
of cold to contract and combine
to congeale and draw into a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
roome; thus is it now with
our charity. For whereas like
the heat in our naturall bodies,
it should diffuse it selfe into all
the members thereof, unto the
whole Christian Church, yet I
know not how it hath, taken
<pb facs="tcp:24022:12"/>
cold, for men contract their
love now into a very small
compasse and narrow roome,
that is, to no more then to such
who jumpe with them in the
same opinion about Religion,
leaving others who differ from
them, to nothing but death and
damnation. For not only in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
countries but in the same
Kingdome, in the same City,
nay in the same family there are
severall Religions, or at the least
severall opinions about Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
raigning: So that what Saint
<hi>Austine</hi> complained of in his
time is truly verified in these,
<hi>Epist. 147. Thou seest</hi> (saith he)
<hi>with how great and miserable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction
Christian houses and
families are divided &amp; troubled;
husbands and wives can agree
well enough to goe to bed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but they cannot agree to goe
<pb facs="tcp:24022:13"/>
to Christs Altar together: There
they sweare peace one to another,
but here they can have no peace.
Parents and children live well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
together in one house of
their own, but one house of Gods
will not hold them both. Their
desire is that those should succeed
them in their own inheritance,
who yet think they have no inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
with Christ. Masters &amp;
servants divide the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Lord
and Master of us all, who yet took
upon him the forme of a servant,
that so he might free all:</hi> I say
never more fully verified then
in these daies; For in how many
families shall we observe this
great division, the husband goes
to Church and the wife staies
at home, or the wife goes to
Church and the husband staies
at home, and so between pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
and children, Masters and
<pb facs="tcp:24022:13"/>
servants. The father will give
his sonne the portion of his
land, who yet thinks he shall
have no portion in the land of
the living.</p>
            <p>The great division of the
Christian world, was first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the East and West Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and this West hath been
since subdivided into the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
and the reformed Religion: So
that the division amongst Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
which is considerable is
but into three parts, the Eastern,
the Romanist, &amp; our Reformed.
All Christian Churches, and so
farre forth the members of
them brethren and sisters; and
not only Christian Churches,
but also Catholike &amp; Orthodoxe
in these points wherein they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
one with another, &amp; with
the Primitive Church. Why
may it not be with these Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb facs="tcp:24022:14"/>
as it was with those seven
Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> which S. <hi>Iohn</hi>
wrote unto, in which there
were some things commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
&amp; other things amisse? they
were encouraged in the former
and reproved for the latter.
And although some of them
were better then others, yet
you shall scarce finde one of
them to which he doth not say,
<hi>habeo adversus to pauca,</hi> I have a
few things against thee: And yet
we shall finde that Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
was in the midst of all these
seaven Churches, <hi>for he was in
the midst of the seaven golden
candlesticks, Revel. 1. 13. and
had in his right hand seaven
starres. Revel.</hi> 1. 16. For writing
to the Church of Ephesus, he
maketh this one of his attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes:
<hi>Apoc. 21. These things</hi>
(saith he) <hi>who holdeth the seaven
<pb facs="tcp:24022:14"/>
starres in his right hand, who
walketh in the midst of the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
golden Candlesticks.</hi> So that
our Saviour walked in the midst
of all these Churches, even in
that lukewarme Church of <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea,</hi>
which he threatned to
spue out of his mouth. And let
Rome tell us never so much of
her infallibility and unerring
chaire, yet questionlesse there is
none of our Churches, no not the
best of them, that our Saviour
may not say to her, <hi>habeo adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
to pauca,</hi> I have a few things
against thee. And as those seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Churches, though some of
them very faulty, yet were all
severall members of Christ, and
helped to make up one body: so
all those Churches, though some
of them much to blame, yet may
all help to make up one Chatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Church: and why may it
<pb facs="tcp:24022:15"/>
not be so in these. Churches I
speak of? For first they all agree
in that one and only foundation
of Religion, Iesus Christ as the
Apostle calleth him, <hi>No other
foundation can any other man lay,
then that which is laid, to wit Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ,</hi> and this no doubt is a
sure and good foundation, and
this maketh them to be Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Churches, they are all bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
into Christ, and looke to be
saved by his sufferings: And
think not this to be a small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
for S. <hi>Paul</hi> desired to know
nothing else, <hi>I esteemed not</hi> (saith
he) <hi>to know any thing among you
but Iesus Christ, and him cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi>
and it worked upon his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
as much as upon his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.
<hi>God forbid that I
should rejoyce</hi> (saith he) <hi>save in
the crosse of our Lord Iesus
Christ, Gal.</hi> 6. 14. that is in Christ
<pb facs="tcp:24022:15"/>
crucified. Besides this one foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
they all embrace the
two Testaments, the three
Creeds, and the foure first gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Councells, and many other
very materiall points. The
discord amongst us Christians
hath been long agoe objected
to us; and certainely there
hath nothing so much drawn
some out of the Church, and
kept others from comming
to the Church, as these quarrels
amongst our selves; Vnto whom
I briefly answere: If they like
not our differences, let them
joyne with us in those things
wherein we agree, and that is
to be Christians, to beleeve in
Christ and him crucified, and
those other principall points
whereof I speak, and to strive to
imitate Christ to their power,
and then our discords will lesse
<pb facs="tcp:24022:16"/>
trouble them. It is true, we have
not all built alike upon this
foundation, but some no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
have built wood and straw,
as well as silver and gold; yet
all of us no doubt did strive to
imitate Christ as neare as we
could, both in our doctrine and
in our practice: and certainly
in these superstructures of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
good intentions must goe
farre, or else it will goe hard
with many of us; not that they
altogether excuse the fault, but
doubtlesse they take off much
from the punishment. There is
a difference between the East
and west Churches, in what
kinde of bread the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist
is to be receaved; th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
East receiving in unleavene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
bread, the west in leavened. And
herein though they differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves, yet the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:24022:16"/>
both strive to imitate Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the one Church thought
our Saviour used then the bread
that was leavened, the other,
that which was unleavened.
Either Church is the lesse
blameable because they think
both that they follow our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
example.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>S.</hi> Austin <hi>in like manner doth
prettily reconcile a difference
between some concerning the
time how often we should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave
the holy Sacrament of the
Lords supper; for some it
seemes in his time thought we
were bound to receave the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist
every day, others but
now and then.</hi> Some <hi>(saith he</hi>
Epist. 118.) communicate daily,
others but upon certain daies,
some will omit no day, others will
only receive on the Sabbath, and
the Lords day. There is a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb facs="tcp:24022:17"/>
to be used in both these:
Some will say we must not daily
receive the Sacrament, because
we ought to select and set apart
some daies wherein we must live
more carefully and religiously, and
so come to the Sacrament more
worthily and with greater devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
On the other side, another
tells us, yea but if the plague-sore
of sinne and violence of the disease
be so great and dangerous, such
soveraigne medicines as these are
not to be deferred. Of both these
saith he let every man take his
choice, and doe that which he
thinks in his conscience he may
best and most piously performe;
for neither of these dishonour the
body and blood of our Saviour,
but rather both of them doe strive
to honour this saving Sacrament.
For <hi>Zacheus</hi> rejoyced greatly to
entertaine our Saviour in his
<pb facs="tcp:24022:17"/>
house. The Centurion said, Lord
I am not worthy thou shouldest
come under my roofe; both of these
did worship and honour our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
though after a diverse, and
as it were a contrary manner, both
of them being miserable by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of sinne, both of them obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mercy for their sinnes. Thus
one man to honour Christ dares
not receive every day, another al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to honour Christ dares not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any day. <hi>And although these
be but petty differences, yet
why may I not apply it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
of greater moment,
especially seeing that ancient
Father S.</hi> Salvian lib. 5. de Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntia,
<hi>hath found a good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
in the</hi> Arians <hi>the most
pernitious and most dangerous
hereticks accounted that ever
have been in the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> They
whom we account hereticks <hi>(saith
<pb facs="tcp:24022:18"/>
he)</hi> account not themselves here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
for they so much esteeme
themselves good Catholikes, that
they defame us with the note and
appellation of heresy. That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
which they be to us, the very
same are we to them. We are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that they injure the divine
generation in that they say the
Sonne is lesse and inferior to the
Father: They think us likewise
injurious to the Father, because
we make the Sonne equall unto
him. The true honour of God is
amongst us, but they think that
to be the honour of the Deity, to
believe as they believe. They are
undutifull but they think it the
greatest duty of their Religion:
They are impious but they think
this to be true piety. They erre
therefore, but they erre with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good minde and intention, not
with a hatred, but with a good
<pb facs="tcp:24022:18"/>
affection towards God, verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that they honour and love
God. Although they have not the
right Faith, yet they notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
think this to be perfect
love towards God. In what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
they shall bee punished in the
day of Iudgement for this very
error of false opinion, no man can
tell but the judge himselfe.</p>
            <p>A good lesson for the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>purres
of these times, with
whom it is a very easy matter
to pronounce damnation upon
the very least disagreement in
Religion, whereas this good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would not determine any
thing concerning these great he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
the Arians, but leaves
them to the mercy of the judge,
not being able to discerne what
they did deserve. You see that
this holy Father findes out a
good intention even in these
<pb facs="tcp:24022:19"/>
hereticks. And if there was a
good intention amongst those
that were so grossely erroneous,
why may there not be good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
found out amongst us
also, who are not at such great
oddes, and acknowledged on all
sides to have no such dangerous
opinions amongst us.</p>
            <p>I speak not this any whit to
countenance that opinion of the
Arians, which is creeping into
the Church againe, but leave
them to stand or fall to their
own master, and shall in the
mean time be perswaded that
they goe not against their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
and so farre forth hit will
goe better with them: yet with
this holy Father, not free them
from punishment, but must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
the manner and measure
thereof to the time of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:24022:19"/>
               <hi>Those of the Church of
Rome are so impatient of this
doctrine, that they care not for
being saved unlesse they may be
saved alone; And their writers
generally agree upon nothing
so much, as that out of their
Communion there is no Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
One of their late writers,</hi>
(Barckly Paren. l. 1. cap. 1) <hi>can
professe thus,</hi> We <hi>(saith he)</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
with the whole Church,
and we command with Moses
that Heaven and Earth would
heare us, that there is no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

that these Protestants doe so far
differ from us in matters of faith,
that they altogether in vaine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect

which are prepared for us. <hi>And
afterwards he saith,</hi> Hee that
dares believe a stubborne and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
Protestant can be saved,
<pb facs="tcp:24022:20"/>
doth by so believing fall from the
Catholike Faith. And that this
is no private or obscure sentence
of the Church, but that all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
are of the same mind, that
none of them are ignorant of it,
nor any can dissemble it, unlesse
he be an unexpert Divine, or for

not heaven able to hold us as

be any disparagement to
yours? It seemes it will. But
to come a litle closer to you: Is
it nothing with you at one
breath, to throw so many soules
headlong to hell, for whom
Christ died; and which is more
who are already incorporate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ by Baptisme? It cost
more to redeeme their soules;
but you will let that alone for
ever. Our comfort is that though
you passe such sentence upon us
here, yet you are not to be our
Iudges hereafter, but must your

salvation be as deere unto us, as
yours is unto you? or why should
you not think us to have as great
a care of our salvation, as you
have of yours? For could wee
be perswaded that wee were

salvation out of your Church,
how quickly would we fly unto
you? How gladly would we be
entertained by you? what means
and moans would we make to

            <p>Neither are you thus fierce
alone, there are some of our own
side, to requite you in your
owne kind, are as confident that
you cannot be saved, as you are
that we cannot; so that the
Question now is, In which of
our two Churches salvation is
to be had? For taking for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:24022:22"/>
that wee have excluded all
others, and got heaven between
us, we cannot be content to
share it, but we must confine and
ingrosse it to one of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
as though it could not be
had in both, nay as though it
could not be had out of both; for
I am verily perswaded, and
dare undertake to make it good,
that those poore Easterne Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
who differ from us both,
will yet come to heaven assoon
as either of us: which were it
well considered might be a
good means to pacifie this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
and to abate the heate of

            <p>But this monopolizing of
Christ, although it be generally
entertain'd by the Romane Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
yet are not all our reformed
Divines so straite lac't, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them, and those of no
<pb facs="tcp:24022:22"/>

others should be saved with
them, and therefore they are
called by you, by way of derisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>(Preface to Charity mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken)
good fellow Christians. As
though they had so much of the
good fellow in them, that they
have too little of the good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi>
And indeed you have most
reason to be angry with these
good fellow Christians, for they
are like to doe you all the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,
for having found that
there may be salvation in our
Church as well, yea, with more
ease then in yours, we shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be thinking of going any
further. As for those who are
so eager, `that will confine salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to one certaine Church, you
have some hope of them, that in
time they may come over to
you: And what you object to us
<pb facs="tcp:24022:23"/>
as a crime, wee esteeme as our
great glory, and account it one
of God's speciall blessings that
wee live in the bosome of a
Church that is so charitable, and
we are willing to have so much
of the good fellow in us, because
we would not have too litle of
the good Christian: for though
our Creed be compris'd in a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
roome, yet our charity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
farre, not only to you, but
the Easterne Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We have a litle Sister, and shee
hath no breasts, what shall we doe
for our Sister, in the day when she
shall be spoken of? We have a litle
Sister. Cant.</hi> 8. 8. Though the
Church of Rome call the
Church of Greece Hereticall
and Schismaticall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, yet we of
the Church of England, esteeme
her to be a Daughter of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Church, and our Sister,
<pb facs="tcp:24022:23"/>
though now she be litle, yet she
was a great one, not inferiour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
waies to the Church of
Rome, she brought forth many
children, and gave milk plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully;
but now alas she is litle by
reason of her long persecution,
and her breasts dried up, for
now she is in a manner barren
and able to bring forth but few
children. And although Shee be
in this poore and desolate estate,
yet the Church of Rome will
doe nothing for her, for when at
the Councell of Florence shee
desired aide of them against the
Turkes, they gave her no suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
at all, but left her in misery
here, and adiudged her as they
doe us to death and damnation
hereafter. <hi>What shall we doe for
our Sister?</hi> so long as we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
her for our Sister, wee
should be willing to doe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:24022:24"/>
for her <hi>in the day when she
shall be spoken of;</hi> for as yet no
body speakes for her, no body
laments her, but lets her alone,
as if she deserved no pity, no
succour, no commiseration, the
Romanists have perswaded so
many that she is schismaticall
and hereticall in her tenents.
But all those who esteeme of
her as a sister, I hope will doe
some thing for her in the day
when she shall be spoken for,
when her cause shall be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and she cleared from hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
such dangerous and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Doctrines, then certainly
she will have many to pity her,
many to helpe her.</p>
            <p>But the confining of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

only sharpened the pens of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

<pb facs="tcp:24022:24"/>
but also hath unsheathed the

effussion of much

it a strange thing in his time for

his brethren, but brother goeth to

maketh that to be a motive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

16. 2. Doe you not think you
<pb facs="tcp:24022:25"/>
have done God good service in
those many massacres in France,
in every of which how many
thousands of poore Christians
have you swept away with such
a suddaine destruction, that had
they been willing, you gave
them not so much time as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
them of their Protestancy?
Doe you not think that you had
done God good service, if that
horrible designe of the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder-Treason
had taken ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
a prodigie not to be spoken
of without horrour and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
void of all humanity as
well as Christianity. But doe
what you can, call us Heretiques
Schismatiques, and what other
disgracefull name you can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
imprison us, banish us,
strangle us, stifle us, burne us,
hang us, wee are yet your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
Certainly had our Savi-intended
<pb facs="tcp:24022:26"/>
to begin or propogate
his Church by this meanes, hee
could as easily have sent forth
mighty men of warre to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
others to believe in him, as
poore fishermen who catch
none but such as come to net,
or are fairly allured to lay hold
on the bait. If this open hostili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
were used against the Turks,
the common enemy of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
name, there were some
pretence for it; and therefore
we read that <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 2.
when he saw the Israelite and
the Egyptian fight, he did not
say, why strive you, but drew his
sword, and slew the Egyptian,
but when he saw the two Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
fight, he said, <hi>yee are bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
why strive yee.</hi> What a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
sight would it be to see
the red Crosle once againe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
as it was in the daies of
<pb facs="tcp:24022:26"/>
               <hi>Constantine?</hi> and if wee did not
see it written in heaven, I hope
wee should finde it true upon
earth, <hi>in hoc signo vinces.</hi> Vnto
this holy warre I suppose all
they would come, who have
promised to fight under Christ's
banner. And set aside for a while
this private interest of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
and Papist, and Grecian,
and Lutheran, and Calvinist, and
Arminian, and Socinian, and if
there be any other division a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, and take upon us that
generall livery of Christianity,
and so joyne together to rescue
our brethren from that wilde
Boare of the Forrest which hath
laid wast this goodly vine; &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
we might see how we
could decide the Controversies
amongst Christians: For whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
is in the right, I hope wee
are all well enough perswaded
<pb facs="tcp:24022:27"/>
that he is in the wrong. Could
<hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> otherwise
deadly enemies be made
friends, and agree together to
condemne Christ, and shall not
those, who are already brethren
and therefore should be friends,
combine together to save
Christ: I say to save Christ, for
so long as we save and preserve
his members, we save and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
him; but so long as we suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
his members to be thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
and oppressed, hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
choose but suffer with them:
But wee in steed of bandying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the common enemy, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
up our forces one against ano<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther,
and find that to be true by
lamentable experience, there is
no greater hatred then of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
that are falllen out.</p>
            <p>Seeing then that all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
are brethren, I say brethren,
<pb facs="tcp:24022:27"/>
as having one Father of us all,
brethren as having one faith, one
Lord, one Baptisme, whereby
we are borne into the Catholike
Church, and one food by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the Eucharist, which
makes us groane to be perfect
men in Christ; seeing we are all
these waies brethren, I may
well say as <hi>Moses</hi> did, <hi>yee are
brethren why strive yee?</hi> or if yee
must needs be striving about
matters of Religion, strive and
<hi>strive earnestly for the faith
which was once delivered to the
Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And because I say we are
brethren I would not have you
think we like not the cause we
have in hand, or that we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to yeeld unto you, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
joyne hands with you, as
some of you imagine, and many
of our side causelesly suspect, but
<pb facs="tcp:24022:28"/>
this is all, we would have the
breach no greater then it is, and
would not have the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
because we differ in some
things, that wee agree in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
And although we call
you brethren, wee will not
winke at your faults, or joyne
with you in them, but this doth
put us in minde to admonish
you more gently of them as bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
though you rage never so
fiercely against us, for by this
meanes wee shall expresse our
charity towards you, and so heap
coles of fire upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your head. God
he knowes we are farre enough
from yeelding to you as Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,
yet should we not be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
to you as Christians, we
were much to blame. But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee
how you mistake, or rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
pervert and abuse this our
charity: <hi>For</hi> (say you) <hi>by your
<pb facs="tcp:24022:28"/>
own acknowledgement, there may
be salvation in our Church, but
we all deny there can be salvation
in yours, therefore all if they had
care of themselves would have
recourse to us, for it is the safer
way to be a member of that
Church where both sides yeeld
there may be salvation, then in
that where one side denies it.</hi> This
were something if Salvation or
Damnation depended upon opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
but I suppose that charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
opinion of ours in hopeing
you may be saved, makes you
never a whit the nearer heaven,
but our selves, and that rough
censure of yours in setting us all
out for damnation, makes us no
whit the neerer hell but your
selves. And I had rather be a
member of that Church which
holds there may be salvation in
both, then of that which holds
<pb facs="tcp:24022:29"/>
there can be salvation but in
one. For holding with the first
I am safe wheresoever I am, but
holding with the latter, I must
be in danger wheresoever I am.
I say wheresoever I am; for I
am not only in danger of my sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
if I be in that Church
wherein I think there is no sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
but also in that out of
which I think there can be no
salvation, because I confine sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
to one of these, which
though I think it be in this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
yet it may be in the other
alone.</p>
            <p>Many other motives unto
charity might be shewed, but
these briefly shall suffice for me,
The one is, that we are Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and therefore brethren, and
so ought to love as brethren; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
is, in that I hope our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
are good, and that none
<pb facs="tcp:24022:29"/>
maintaines a false opinion per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versely
against his conscience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>and this last is, that for some opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
that are not so orthodoxe
yet there may be hopes of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
although it be not without
smart and punishment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now let me say unto all
Christians, as S.</hi> Paul <hi>doth to the</hi>
Corinthians 2. Cor. 6. 11. 12. 13.
O yee Christians, our mouth is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
unto you, and not only so, but
our heart is enlarged, <hi>not only to
the Roman, but even to the East
Church, and to as many as call
upon the name of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</hi>
Ye are not straitned in us, but
ye are straitned in your own bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
now for a recompence in the
same, I speak unto you as unto
Brethren, be ye also enlarged.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let me bespeak all learned
Prelats and Pastors on all sides, as
S.</hi> Austine Epist. 147. <hi>doth</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culianus
<pb facs="tcp:24022:30"/>
               <hi>a Bishop and a favourer
of the Donatists,</hi> I pray and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
thee (<hi>saith he</hi>) if there be
any good disposition in thee, which
many doe extoll, and commend, if
it be not a counterfeit courtesy by
reason of worldly honour, that
the tender bowells of pitty and
compassion begin to yerne in thee,
and that you would have these
controversies discussed between
us at the length, not by wrangling
and railing one at another, but by
fervent prayers and earnest sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
unto Almighty God,
and by comparing all things
peaceably and examining them in
the spirit of meeknesse, lest the
poore ignorant people which now
yeeld to and willingly obey our
jurisdiction and command over
them, presse us with this their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
and dutifull obedience to
us in the day of the Lord Iesus,
<pb facs="tcp:24022:30"/>
               <hi>and say, they did as their leaders
directed them,</hi> but rather by our
unfained love and charity, being
together with us drawn from
those by paths of errour and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sention,
they should be directed
into the right way of truth and
peace. <hi>I will conclude all with
our Churches prayer, that it
would</hi> please God to inspire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
the Vniversall Church,
with the spirit of truth, unity and
concord, and grant that all they
who doe confesse his holy name,
may agree in the truth of his holy
word, and live in unity and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
love! <hi>And although we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
at the first attaine to that
perfection to be of one minde,
yet let us beginne to be chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and beare with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for who knowes but that
by entertaining this bond of
peace, we may in good time</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:24022:31"/>

               <p>15 Great are the confliccts of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

               <p>16 This then should be our chiefe

               <p>16 The greatest perfection wee
can attaine to in this life, it hath some
imperfection annexed to it, and our
greatest light of knowledge is not void
of some darknesse.</p>
               <p>17 An humble knowledge of thy

then a profound searching into other
kinds of learning.</p>
               <p>18 Not that humane learning is
blame-worthy, nor the knowledge of
any thing whatsoever is to be disliked,

because it is good in it selfe, and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

               <p>19 But yet a good conscience is
to be preferred before all knowledge,
and a vertuous life before all learning.</p>

labour more to know well, then to live
well, this makes them so much to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <p>21 O if men would be as carefull

26 In their life time they seemed
to be some body; who but they? but
now they are gone, we heare not a

               <p>27 O how quickly doth the glory
of this world passe away; would God
their life had been answerable to their

in that they make small account of the

of profiting.</head>
               <p>VVOuld we not busie our selves
in other mens imployments,
which we have nothing to doe withall,
we might enjoy at home much peace
within our selves.</p>
               <p>2 How can he continue long in any
quietnesse, that thrusteth himselfe into
other mens affaires, who seeketh occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to be busie abroad, and seldome
takes occasion to recollect himselfe at
home.</p>
               <p>3 Blessed are the simple and pure in
heart, for they shall inherit abundance
of peace.</p>
               <p>4 Why are some of the Saints come
to such perfection, &amp; given to so much
contemplation, but because their whole
care hath beene to mortify themselves
and their earthly desires.</p>
               <p>5 And this hath made them able
freely to attend their own affaires, and
with the whole strength of their soule
to unite themselves to their God.</p>
               <p>6 But as for us we are too much car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:24022:43"/>
away with our unbridled passions
and too too sollicitous for temporall
trash.</p>
               <p>7 We also seldome overcome any one
vice as we should, we are not enflamed
to profit daily more and more, and this
makes us continue cold in devotion,
and luke-warme in Religion.</p>
               <p>8 Were we but once throughly dead
unto our selves, and not inwardly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
in our owne soules, then
should we relish the things that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
and get some experience of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
contemplations.</p>
               <p>9 The greatest and indeed the only
impediment is, that we are in bondage
to our passions and vile affections, and
labour not to follow the perfect foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps
of the faithfull.</p>
               <p>10 And when any small adversity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falleth
us, then we are very soone cast
downe, and betake our selves to the
miserable comforters of this world.</p>
               <p>Now if we would not give back but
like valiant souldiers stand upon our
guard doubtlesse the Lord would send
us helpe from above.</p>
               <p>12 For he that gives occasion to fight,
to the end we may get the victory, sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:24022:43"/>
is ready to helpe those that fight
manfully.</p>
               <p>14 If we place our progresse in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
onely in these outward obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
then will our devotion come
quickly to an end.</p>
               <p>15 Wherefore we must lay the Axe
to the very roote, that our unquiet affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
being eradicated we may finde
rest to our soules.</p>
               <p>16 If every yeare we did but root
out one vice, we should in a few yeares
become perfect men.</p>
               <p>17 But we often finde it to bee
cleane contrary, that we were better
and purer at the beginning of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
then we have been after many
yeares of our profession.</p>
               <p>18 And whereas our fervour and
forwardnesse should increase daily
more and more, we think it a great
matter if a man retaine but some part
of his first love.</p>
               <p>19 Did we but straine and force
our selves a litle at the first, then might
we doe all things afterwards with ease
and delight.</p>
               <p>20 I confesse indeed it is hard to
leave old wonts, and as hard, yea har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:24022:44"/>
to goe against our owne wills.</p>
               <p>21 If thou art not able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
these things that be litle and
light, how wilt thou be able to conquer
those things that are more difficult?</p>
               <p>22 At the beginning therefore
strive with thine owne inclination, and
unlearne if thou canst a naughty cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,
lest otherwise when thou
wouldst, thou canst not so easily, and
all that thou endeavourest will be but
in vaine.</p>
               <p>23 O if thou didst but consider
what peace thou should'st reape unto
thy selfe, and joy unto others by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haveing
thy selfe well, I suppose thou
wouldst be more carefull of thy profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
towards God, and fearefull to
give any offence unto man.</p>

               <p>IT is good for us sometimes to suffer

they oftentimes call a man home unto

               <p>2 They make a man to know that

and that he must not trust to any thing

               <p>3 It is good for us sometimes to

               <p>SO long as we live in this wicked
world we must look to be troubled
with miseries and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>mptations.</p>
               <p>2 Hence we find it written in that
holy Book of <hi>Iob,</hi> The life of man upon
earth is but a warfare and temptation.</p>
               <p>3 Therefore ought every one to
be very carefull of his courses; and that
he be not led into temptation through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
arme himselfe with watching and
praier.</p>
               <p>4 Lest the Devill find occasion to
entrappe and deceive us, who never
slumbereth but rangeth about seeking
whom he may devour.</p>
               <p>5 There is no man so holy or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
but is tempted sometimes, and to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:24022:45"/>
be utterly without them is altogether
impossible.</p>
               <p>6 Though temptations seeme for
the present to be grievous and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
yet are they often very profitable
to us in the end.</p>
               <p>7 They are instructions, purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and humiliations unto us, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
our lives, they purge our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and humble our soules.</p>
               <p>8 All the saints of God have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
in this life, and passed unto a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
through many tribulations and
temptations.</p>
               <p>9 And those that have not beene
able to endure these temptations, have
become reprobates in themselves and
back-sliders from God.</p>
               <p>10 There is no order so sacred, no
place so secret, where there is not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
temptations to try thee or troubles
to molest thee.</p>
               <p>11 There is no man whilst hee
lives can be wholly free and secure
from temptations.</p>
               <p>12 Though we had none with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
us, we have enough within us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all of us borne in concupiscence
and sinne.</p>

miseries upon miseries, &amp; having
lost our first happinesse, we have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
unhappinesse or other to endure.</p>
               <p>14 Whilst many sèeke to avoid
temptations, they are plung'd into
them deeper, and some to shunne one
trouble fall into a worse.</p>
               <p>15 By flying wee shew our selves
not conquerors but cowards, it is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
abideing and true humility that
make us stronger then all our enemies.</p>
               <p>16 He that cuts off but the branches
of temptations, and plucks not up the
roote from whence they spring, shall
be litle the better.</p>
               <p>17 For they will assaile him so
much the sooner and make him worse
then he was before.</p>
               <p>18 By litle and litle (through
Gods helpe,) by patience and longa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ity
thou shalt more easily get the

or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>turdy importunity.</p>
               <p>19 Often take good advise when
thou thy selfe art tempted, and deale
not roughly with another that is temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but minister unto him comfort, as
thou wouldst be comforted thy selfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:24022:46"/>
20 The very roote and originall
of all evill temptations, is the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy
of our mindes, and the litle
confidence we have in our God.</p>
               <p>21 For as a ship without a sterne
is tossed to and fro with wind and
weather, so a carelesse and unconstant
man hath great variety of temptations.</p>
               <p>22 As fire tryeth yron, so tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
a just man, we know not often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
what we are able to doe, untill
temptations doe shew us what we are.</p>
               <p>23 We must be very watchfull
then especially, when temptation is but
newly begunne, for then is the enemy
more easily overcome.</p>
               <p>24 If thou suffer him not to enter
in at the doore of thine heart, but gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
him his answer at the threshold
when he gives the first knocke.</p>
               <p>25 <hi>Wherefore one said very well,</hi>
               </p>
               <l>Take a disease at the first, and 'twill
easily be cur'd,</l>
               <l>But an after remedy will be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
endur'd.</l>
               <p>26 For first of all there comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thy minde a bare cogitation, next a
strong and vehement imagination, after
that an evill motion and consent joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:24022:47"/>
with a wonderfull delectation.</p>
               <p>27 And so our deadly enemy if we
set him but put in his head, doth after
with greater ease draw in the whole
body.</p>
               <p>28 And by how much the longer
before any man stirreth against his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
by so much the weaker is he when
he doth resist, and his enemy the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
whom he must resist.</p>
               <p>29 Some suffer greatest assaults in
the beginning of their conversion,
and some at the later end, but others
are much troubled all their life long.</p>
               <p>30 Some againe are but gently and
lightly assaulted according to the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and equity of the divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which weigheth the state and
conditions of all men, and pre-ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all things to the salvation of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</p>
               <p>31 We ought not therefore to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire
when we are tempted, but so
much the more fervently pray unto
God, who is ready to helpe us in all
our adversities.</p>
               <p>32 Who according to the saying of
S. <hi>Paul</hi> will not suffer us to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
above that we are able, but will
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:24022:47"/>
give an issue with the temptation, that
we may be able to beare it.</p>
               <p>33 So then in all temptations
and tribulations let us humble our
soules under the mighty hand of God
for the humble in spirit will he save
and exalt.</p>
               <p>34 In these troubles and adversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
a manis proved how much he hath
profited, and the more his vertue hath
been manifested here, the greater shall
be his reward hereafter.</p>
               <p>35 Nor is it any great matter for
a man to be zealous and devout when
nothing doth trouble him, but if in time
of adversity he beare himselfe patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there is good hope he hath profited
not a litle.</p>
               <p>36 Some there are who in great
and fierce temptations are strangely
preserved, who in small and ordinary
trials are often overcome.</p>
               <p>37 To the end that being truly
humbled they never in great matters
trust to their owne strength, who in
such small trifles have shewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be so weak.</p>

we may passe over it for a time, or doe

that for a better.</p>
               <p>3 Let thy worke be never so great

worth; be thy worke but small

effectuall.</p>
               <p>4 For God regardeth not so much
what is done, as how and with what
affection a thing is done, he doth most,
that loves most.</p>
               <p>5 He doth much that doth a thing

and in whom finally all the Saints have

sometimes, at the least once a day, to

therein, compunction bringeth
much good which dissolutenesse is
wont quickly to destroy.</p>
               <p>4 A wonder it is that any man can
heartily rejoyce in this life, if he duly
consider his banishment, and throughly
weight the many perils wherewith his
soule is invironed.</p>
               <p>5 The levity of our minds and the
litle care we have of our faults makes
us insensible of the sorrowes of our
soules.</p>
               <p>6 But we often vainly laugh when
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:24022:60"/>
we should justly weepe: the service and
feare of God is the truest liberty, and
a good conscience a continuall feast.</p>
               <p>7 Happy is he that can avoid all
cause of distraction, and recollect him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to the union of holy compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>8 Happy is he that can cast away
from himselfe all that may defile his
conscience, or any way grieve or bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
it.</p>
               <p>9 Bestirre thy selfe like a man, one
custome overcomes another, if thou
canst forbeare medling in other mens
matters, they likewise shall not have to
doe with thine.</p>
               <p>10 Busie not thy selfe in matters
which appertaine to others, neither doe
thou meddle at all with the affaires of
thy betters.</p>
               <p>11 Still have an eye to thy selfe
first, and be sure more especially to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
thy selfe before all thy loving
friends.</p>
               <p>12 If thou hast not the favour of
men, be not grieved at it, but take this
to heart because thou dost not carry thy
selfe so warily and circumspectly as it
becometh the servant of God and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:24022:61"/>
a devout religious man.</p>
               <p>13 It is better oftentimes and more
secure that a man hath not consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in this life, especially such as are
consonant to our carnall desires.</p>
               <p>14 But that we have not all or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
seldome tasted divine consolation,
we may thank our selves, because we
seeke not after inward compunction,
as having not altogether forsaken out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
vanities.</p>
               <p>15 Know that thou art unworthy
of divine consolation, and that thouhast
deserved much tribulation.</p>
               <p>16 When a man hath perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition,
then is the whole world grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
and loathsome unto him</p>
               <p>17 A good man never wanteth
matter of mourning, for whether he
consider his owne or his neighbours e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
he knowes that none liveth here
without great tribulation.</p>
               <p>18 And by how much a man
looks narrowly into himselfe, by so
much he sees greater cause of lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>29 Our sinnes and wickednesses
wherein we lye weltring, doe minister
unto us so much matter of sorrow and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:24022:61"/>
compunction, that we can seldome
apply our selves to heavenly contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations.</p>
               <p>20 Didst thou but as often think
with thy selfe how soone thou maist
die, as how long thou maist live, there
is no question but thou wouldst more
earnestly labour thine amendment.</p>
               <p>21 If thou but let the paines, that
hereafter are to be endured, sink deeply
into thy heart, I belieeve thou wouldst
willingly undergoe any labour or sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
in this world, and not be afraid
of the greatest severity.</p>
               <p>22 But because we doe not take
these things to heart, and as yet love
those things only that delight us, this
makes us so dull and key-cold in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>23 If our body be amisse we may
thank our selves for it, it is often our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay,
and want of spirit which makes
our miserable body so easily complain.</p>
               <p>24 Pray therefore unto the Lord
with alll humility, that he will vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to give thee the spirit of contrition.</p>
               <p>25 And say with the Prophet, feed

upon the earth, there is none in this

some tribulation or other.</p>
               <p>4 Who is then in the best estate or
condition? even he who for God's sake
can suffer affliction.</p>
               <p>5 Many weake and fraile men
can say, O what an happy life hath such
a one, how wealthy, how mighty he is,
in how great honour and credit.</p>
               <p>6 But lift up thine eyes to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of heaven, and thou shall perceive
that all the goods of this life are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

               <p>7 They are very uncertain, rather

burthensome then delightfull, because
they are never enjoyed without care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
and feare.</p>
               <p>8 Mans happinesse consisteth not
in having abundance of wealth, but a
meane estate should content him, it is
truly misery enough even to live upon
the earth.</p>
               <p>9 The more a man hungreth after
godlinesse, the more he abhorreth this
life because he seeth more cleerly and
perceiveth more sensibly the defects of
humane corruption.</p>
               <p>10 For to eat and to drink, to sleep
and to watch, to labour and to rest, and
to be subject to other necessities of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

and delivered from sinne.</p>
               <p>11 For the inward man is much
oppressed with these outward and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall

               <p>12 Therefore the holy Prophet
prayeth with great devotion to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

               <p>13 But woe be to them that know

               <p>14 And some there be so much
dote upon it, although with great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

the Kingdome of heaven.</p>
               <p>15 O how mad are these in their
braines and faithlesse in their hearts,
who lie so deeply drowned in the earth
that they can think of nothing but
earthly things.</p>
               <p>16 But miserable wretches as
they are, they shall in the end feele to
their cost how vile and vaine that was
which they loved.</p>
               <p>17 Whereas the Saints of God,
and all the fast friends of Christ looke
not on those things which pleased the
flesh, and flourished for a time, but pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
after everlasting rreasures with all
greedinesse and desire.</p>
               <p>18 Their whole desire was carried
upward to things durable and invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that the desire of things visible
might not draw them to things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>19 O Brother loose not thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence

there is yet time, the houre is not yet

               <p>23 We could gladly be quiet and

               <p>21 If thou dost not provide for thy

               <p>22 The time that is now present
is very precious, now is the day of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
now is the acceptable time.</p>
               <p>23 But alas that thou shouldst
spend thy time so idlely here, where

hereafter.</p>
               <p>24 The time will come when thou

               <p>25 O be loved from how great

from how great feare free thy selfe, if

               <p>26 Labour now to live so, that at

               <p>29 Ah foole, why dost thou think

snatcht away?</p>
               <p>30 How often dost thou hear
these reports, such a man is slain, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is drowned, a third breaks his neck
with a fall, this man died eating, and
that man playing?</p>
               <p>31 One perished by fire, another
by the sword, another of the plague, and
another was slain by theeves, thus death
is the end of all, and mans life passeth
away like a shadow.</p>
               <p>32 Who shall remember thee
when thou art dead? and who shall
pray for thee when thou canst not help
thy selfe?</p>
               <p>33 Doe, doe now my beloved
whatsoever thou art able to doe, for
thou knowest not when thou shalt die,
not yet what shall befall thee after thy
death.</p>

34 Now whilst thou hast time
heap unto thy selfe everlasting trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
think on nothing but the salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of thy soule, care for nothing but
the service of thy God.</p>
               <p>35 Make now friends to thy selfe
by honouring the Saints of God, and
imitating their vertues, that when thou

               <p>36 Esteem thy selfe as a stranger

one to whom the affaires of this world
doe nothing appertain.</p>
               <p>37 Keep thy heart free from the
world and lifted up directly unto God,
because thou hast here no abiding city.</p>
               <p>38 Send thither thy daily praiers

               <p>14 There is no fault but shall have

               <p>35 Then wilt thou be comforted

that thou hast praied devoutly, then
fared daintily, and be more glad thou

much.</p>
               <p>36 Then will good works prevail
more then godly words, then a strict
life and severe repentance will be more
pleasing then all earthly delight.</p>
               <p>37 Prove first here what thou
canst indure hereafter, accustome thy
selfe now to suffer a little, that thou
maist then be delivered from more
grievous pains.</p>
               <p>38 If now thou canst indure so li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
how wilt thou then be able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
perpetuall torments, if a litle suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering

               <p>39 Assure thy selfe thou canst not

injoy delights in this world, and after
that raign for ever with Christ.</p>
               <p>40 Suppose thou hadst hitherto
lived alwaies in honour and delights,
what would all this avail thee if thou
wert to die at this instant.</p>
               <p>41 All therefore is but vanity and
texation of spirit, besides the love of
God and his alone service.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:24022:70"/>
42 For he that loyeth God with
all his heart is neither afraid of death
nor judgment, nor of punishment, nor
of hell, for perfect love gives secure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
to God.</p>
               <p>43 But he that takes delight in
sin, what marveil is it if he be afraid
both of Death and Iudgment? Yet it
is good although love be not of force
to withhold thee from sinne, that at

thee.</p>
               <p>44 But he that laieth aside the fear
of God, can never continue long in
good estate, but falleth quickly into the

               <p>2 A passionate man turneth good

               <p>5 He considereth what others are

               <p>12 There be who are at peace

               <p>13 And others there are who keep
themselves in peace and labour to bring

               <p>14 Our greatest peace, in this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable

               <p>3 Thou shalt rest quietly if thine
heart reprove thee not; rejoyce not but
when thou hast done well.</p>
               <p>4 Wicked men have never any
true joy, neither doe they feele inward
peace, for there is no peace to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
saith the Lord.</p>
               <p>5 Although they say we live in
peace, there shall no evill happen unto
us, and who dares doe us any harm.</p>

7 To glory in tribulation is no
hard thing to him that loveth, for so to
glory is to glory in the Crosse of our
Lord.</p>
               <p>8 The glory is short which is given
and received from men, sorrow alwaies
attends the glory of the world.</p>
               <p>9 The glory of the good is in the
testimony of a good conscience, and
not in the tongues of men, the
gladnesse of the just is of God,
and in God, and their joy is of the
truth.</p>
               <p>10 He that desireth true and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
glory careth not for that which
is temporall, and he that seeketh after
temporall glory, or contemneth it not
from his heart, is lesse in love with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly.</p>
               <p>11 He injoyeth great tranquility
of mind, that eareth not for the praises
or dispraises of men, he is easily content
and pacified whose conscience is pure.</p>
               <p>12 Thou art not the more holy
for being commended, nor the more
vile for being dispraised, thou art what
thou art, neither canst thou be greater
then what thou art in the sight of God.</p>
               <p>13 If thou consider what thou art
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:24022:83"/>
within thee, thou wilt not care what
men say of thee, man seeth but the face,
but God considereth the heart.</p>
               <p>14 Man looketh upon the deeds,
but God weigheth the intentions; to
doe alwaies well, and to esteeme litle
of thy selfe, is a signe of an humble
mind.</p>
               <p>15 To refuse to be comforted by
any creature is a signe of great purity
and inward confidence.</p>
               <p>16 He that seeketh a thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
himselfe, to bear witnesse of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
it is plain he hath referred himselfe
wholly unto God.</p>
               <p>17 For not he that commendeth
himselfe the same is approved, saith S.
<hi>Paul,</hi> but hee whom God commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</p>
               <p>17 To walk inwardly with God
and not to be possessed with any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

himselfe for Iesus sake.</p>
               <p>2 Thou oughest to leave thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved

will alone be beloved above all things.</p>
               <p>3 The love of the creature is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiptfull
and unconstant, the love of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus

               <p>4 He that cleaveth to creatures
shall full with that which is ready to
fall, he that embraceth Iesus shall be

               <p>5 Love him, and keep him for thy
friend, who when all goe away, will
not forsake thee nor suffer thee to perish
in the end.</p>
               <p>6 Prevent the world and begin to
forsake it first before it forsake thee, for
thou must one day be left of all men
whether thou wilt or no.</p>
               <p>7 Stick thee close to Iesus both in
life and death; and commit thy selfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <p>8 Thy beloved is of that nature,
that he will none of that which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
to others, but will have thy
heart alone, and sit like a King in his
owne throne.</p>
               <p>9 If thou couldest purge thy selfe
perfectly of all creatures, Iesus would
willingly dwell with thee: whatsoever
confidence thou reposest in men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Iesus, is all no better then lost.</p>
               <p>10 Trust not, nor rely upon a reed
full of wind; for that all flesh is as grasse
and all the glory thereof shall wither
away as the flower of the field.</p>
               <p>11 Thou shalt quickly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
if thou look only to the outward
shew of men: and if in them thou see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
for comfort and commodity, thou
shalt instead thereof often feele losses
and crosses.</p>
               <p>12 If thou seekest Jesus in all
things, thou shalt surely find Iesus: but
if thou seekest thy selfe, thou shalt also
find thy selfe, but to thine own destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>13 For man doth more hurt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,

               <p>2 When Iesus speaketh not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly

worth; but if Iesus speak but one word,
we feele much consolation.</p>

               <p>4 Happy is the houre when Iesus
calleth from the teares of the eyes to

art thou without Iesus?</p>
               <p>How foolish and vaine, if thou desire
any thing out of Iesus? Is not this a

without Iesus? To be without Iesus is
a grievous hell; and to be with Iesus is
a sweet Paradise.</p>

                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:24022:85"/>

               <p>9 Be humble, and peaceable, and
Iesus will be with thee; be devout and

all these are to be prayed for, that all

               <p>17 Never desire to be singularly

               <p>5 We are alwaies willing to have
something for our comfort: and a man
doth hardly put off, and forsake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
The holy Martyr S. Laurence over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the world with his Prelate.</p>
               <p>6 Because he despised whatsoever
seemed delightsome in the world: and

to be taken from him, whom he most
loved.</p>
               <p>7 He overcame therefore the love
of man by the love of the Creator; and
he rather chose the divine pleasure, then
humane comfort.</p>

8 See thou also learne to forsake
some necessary thing, and a beloved
friend for the love of God.</p>
               <p>9 Be not grieved when thou art
forsaken by a friend, knowing that we
all at length must be separated one
from another.</p>
               <p>10 A man must fight long, and
with a constant mind, before he g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the victory, and be able to place his
whole heart in God.</p>
               <p>11 When a man trusteth in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
he easily slideth unto humane
comforts.</p>
               <p>12 But a true lover of Christ, and
a diligent follower of vertue, giveth
not himselfe to such solace, nor seeketh
sensible sweetnesse, but rather forcible
exercises, and to sustaine hard labours
for Christ.</p>
               <p>13 When therefore spirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
is given thee from God, receive it
thankfully; but know that it is the gift
of God, not any desert of thine.</p>
               <p>14 Be not puffed up, joy not too
much, neither doe thou presume vainly:
but be rather the more humble for that
grace, and more wary and fearefull in
all thy actions: for that houre will
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:24022:87"/>
passe away, and temptation will suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
               <p>15 When consolation is taken from
thee, despaire not presently; but with
humility and patience attend the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
visitation: for God is able againe
to give thee greater consolation.</p>
               <p>16 This is not new nor strange
unto them, that have experience in the
way of God; for in the great Saints
and ancient Prophets, there was often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
such kind of alteration.</p>
               <p>17 For which cause one when he
had grace, said, I said in my prosperity I
shall never be removed.</p>
               <p>18 But when this was gone from
him, he addeth what he found in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thou turnedst thy face
from me, and I became troubled.</p>
               <p>19 Yet doth he not despaire in the
midst of these changes, but more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
prayeth unto our Lord, and
saith: Vnto thee (O Lord) <hi>I</hi> will cry,
and I will pray unto my God.</p>
               <p>20 Lastly he receiveth the fruit of
his prayer, and witnesseth that he was
heard, saying: Our Lord hath heard
me, and taken pity on me: our Lord is
become my helper.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:24022:88"/>
21 But wherein? Thou hast tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
(saith he) my sorrow into joy, and
thou hast compassed me about with
gladnesse.</p>
               <p>22 If great Saints have been so
dealt with all, we that are poore and
weake ought not to despaire, if we
be sometimes fervent, and sometimes
cold.</p>
               <p>23 For the spirit commeth and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
according to the good pleasure
of his will, for which cause blessed
<hi>Iob</hi> saith, Thou visitest him early in the
morning, and suddainly thou provest
him.</p>
               <p>24 Whereupon therefore can I
hope, or wherein ought I to trust, but
in the great mercy of God alone,
and in the onely hope of heavenly
grace?</p>
               <p>25 For whether I enjoy the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of good men, or devout brethren,
or faithfull friends, or holy Bookes,
or learned treatises, or sweet songs and
himmes,</p>
               <p>26 All these helpe litle, and have
litle savour, when grace forsaketh me,
and I remaine left in my owne poverty.</p>
               <p>27 At such a time there is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:24022:88"/>
remedy then patience, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
of my selfe unto the will of
God.</p>
               <p>28 I never found any so religious
and devout, that hath not had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a with drawing of grace, or felt
not a decrease of fervour.</p>
               <p>29 There was never Saint so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rapt, and illuminated, who first or
last was not tempted.</p>
               <p>30 For he is not worthy of the
high contemplation of God, who hath
not been exercised with some tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for God's sake.</p>
               <p>31 For temptation going before,
is wont to be a signe of ensuing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
And unto those that are proved
by temptations, heavenly comfort is
promised. He that shall overcome, saith
he, I will give him to eate of the tree of
life.</p>
               <p>32 But divine comfort is given,
that a man may be stronger to beare
adversities. There followeth also tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,
lest we should waxe proud of
that good.</p>
               <p>33 The Divell sleepeth not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>6 God doth well in giving grace:
but man doth evill in not returning it
againe wholly unto God, with thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.</p>
               <p>7 And therefore the gifts of grace
cannot flow in us, because we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull
to the given: and returne them
not wholly to the head fountaine.</p>
               <p>8 For grace is ever due to him that
is thankfull, and from the proud shall
be taken that which is wont to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the humble.</p>
               <p>9 I desire not that consolation
that taketh from me compunction, nor

               <p>10 For all that is high, is not holy:
nor all that is sweet, good: nor every
desire, pure; nor every thing that is deare
unto us, is gratefull to God.</p>
               <p>11 I doe willingly accept of that
grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereby I may ever become
more humble and fearful, and be made
more ready and able to forsake my
selfe.</p>
               <p>12 He that is taught by the gift of
grace, and by the scourge of the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:24022:90"/>
thereof; will nor dare to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
any good to himselfe: but will
rather acknowledge himselfe poor, and
naked.</p>
               <p>13 Give unto God that which is
God's; and ascribe unto thy selfe that
which is thine own: that is, give thanks
unto God for his grace, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that nothing is to be attributed
to thee, but only sinne, and the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
due thereunto.</p>
               <p>14 Content thy selfe, and desire
alwaies the meanest and lowest things,
and the highest shall be given thee: for
the highest stand not without the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est.</p>
               <p>15 The highest Saints before God,
are the least in their owne judgments;
and how much the more glorious, so
much the humbler within themselves.</p>
               <p>16 Those that are full of truth,
and heavenly glory, are not desirous of
the vain glory of this world. Those that
are firmly setled and grounded in God
can no way be prov'd.</p>
               <p>17 And they that ascribe all unto
God what good soever they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
seeke not glory one of another
but would have that glory which is
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:24022:90"/>
from God alone: and desire above all
things to praise God in himselfe, and
in all the Saints, and alwaies tend unto
the same.</p>
               <p>18 Be therefore gratefull for the
least gift, and thou shalt be made wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to receive greater. Let the least be
unto thee also as the greatest, and the
most contemptible as an especiall gift.</p>
               <p>19 If thou consider the worth of
the giver, no gift will seeme litle, or of
meane esteeme. For it is not litle that
is given by the Soveraigne Majesty of
God.</p>
               <p>20 Yea if he should give punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and stripes, it ought to be grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
for that he doth it alwaies for
our salvation, whatsoever he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
to happen unto us.</p>
               <p>20 He that desireth to keepe the
grace of God, let him be thankfull for
the grace given; and patient for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away thereof. Let him pray that

of Christ are.</head>
               <p>IEsus hath now many lovers of his
heavenly Kingdome, but few bearers
of his Crosse: He hath many desirous of
comfort but few of tribulation.</p>
               <p>2 He findeth many companions
of his table, but few of his abstinence.
All desire to rejoyce with him, few
will suffer any thing for him, or with
him.</p>
               <p>3 Many follow Iesus unto the
breaking of bread, but few to the drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the Cup of his Passion. Many
reverence his miracles, few follow the
ignominy of his Crosse.</p>
               <p>4 Many love Iesus, as long as
adversities happen not. Many praise &amp;
blesse him, as long as they receive any
comfort from him.</p>
               <p>5 But if Iesus hide himselfe, and
leave them but a while, they fall either
into complaint, or into too much deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of mind.</p>
               <p>6 But they that love Iesus for Iesus,
and not for some comfort of their
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:24022:91"/>
owne, blesse him in all tribulation and
anguish of heart, as well as in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
comfort.</p>
               <p>7 And although he should never
give them comfort, they notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

give him thankes.</p>
               <p>8 O how powerfull is the pure
love of Iesus, which is mixed with no
selfe-love, nor proper interest! Are they
not all to be called hirelings that ever
seeke comforts?</p>
               <p>9 Doe they not shew themselves
to be rather lovers of themselves, then
of Christ, that alwaies think of their

be found that will serve God, without
looking for reward?</p>
               <p>10 It is hard to find any one so
spirituall, that is free from the love of
all earthly things. For where is any that
is inddeed poore in spirit, and free from
all affection of creatures? thou maist
goe to the end of the world before
thou find him.</p>
               <p>11 If a man should give all his

he is yet farre off.</p>
               <p>12 And if he should have great ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and very fervent devotion, yet there
is much wanting, to wit, one thing
which is most necessary for him.</p>
               <p>13 What is that? That leaving all
he forsake himselfe, and goe perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from himselfe, and retaine nothing
of selfe-love. And when he hath done
all that he knoweth to be done, let
him thinke that he hath done nothing.</p>
               <p>14 Let him not weigh that much
which might be much esteemed, but
according to truth, let him affirme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to be an unprofitable servant, as
our Saviour hath said: When you shall
have done all things that are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
you, say, We are unprofitable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
               <p>15 Then may he be truly poore in

I am alone and poore, yet no man

be much harder to hear that last word:
Get yee away from me, yee cursed into

               <p>2 For they that now willingly heare
and follow the word of the Crosse,
shall not then feare to heare the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

               <p>3 This signe of the Crosse shall be

               <p>5 Why therefore fearest thou to

in the Crosse is life, in the Crosse is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection

sweetnesse, in the Crosse is
strength of mind, in the Crosse is joy

of sanctity.</p>
               <p>7 There is no health of the soule,

               <p>9 For if thou diest with him, thou

his companion in paine, thou shalt be
partaker with him also in glory.</p>
               <p>10 Behold in the Crosse all doth

thou shalt suffer tribulation of spirit.</p>
               <p>14 Sometimes thou shalt be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken

troubled by thy neighbours, and which

               <p>16 For God will have thee learne
to suffer tribulation without comfort;

tribulation.</p>
               <p>17 No man hath so lively a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

               <p>21 And every where of necessity
thou must have patience, if thou wilt

Crowne.</p>
               <p>22 If thou beare the Crosse wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
it will beare thee, and lead thee
to thy desired end, to wit, where there
shall be an end of suffering, though

               <p>23 If thou beare it unwillingly,
thou makest for thy selfe a new bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
and increasest thy load, and yet
notwithstanding thou must beare it
doe what thou canst.</p>
               <p>24 If thou cast away one Crosse,
without doubt thou shalt find another,

               <p>26 Verily Iesus Christ our Lord
was never one houre without paine of
suffering, so long as he lived. Christ
(saith he) ought to suffer, and rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine

his glory.</p>
               <p>27 And how doest thou seeke any

which is the way of the holy Crosse?</p>
               <p>28 The whole life of Christ was

               <p>30 And how much the more one
hath profited in spirit, so much the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier

the love he beareth to God, encreaseth
the griefe which he endureth for his

unto God, how much the more for

               <p>36 This is not the power of man,

               <p>37 It is not according to mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to bear the Crosse, to love the

it into subjection, to shun promotion.</p>
               <p>38 To suffer contumelies with a

joyfull heart, to despise himselfee, and
to wish to be despised, to beare all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities,

               <p>39 But if thou depend upon thy

               <p>40 But if thou trustest in our Lord,
strength shall be given thee from hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ven,
and thou shalt subdue under thee

               <p>41 Neither shalt thou feare thy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
the Divel, if thou be armed with

               <p>42 Resolve therefore with thy

               <p>43 Prepare thy selfe to beare ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

with a good affection, if thou wilt be
his friend, and desirest to have part with
him. As touching consolation, referre
that to the will of God, let him doe
therein as shall best please him, but
yeeld thou thy selfe to the bearing of
adversity, and account it as the greatest
comfort.</p>
               <p>46 Set thou thy heart upon the
suffering of tribulations, and account
them the greatest comforts.</p>
               <p>47 For that the passions of this
life are not worthy of the glory that
shall be revealed, although thou alone
couldest suffer them all.</p>
               <p>48 When thou shalt come to this

shall seeme sweet and pleasant unto
thee, then think it is well with thee,
for thou hast found a Parradise upon

               <p>49 As long as it is grievous unto
thee to suffer, and that thou desirest to

               <p>52 I (saith IESVS) will shew him

thou shouldest rather wish to suffer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities

               <p>59 Because by these meanes thou

8 Love is a great matter, in very
truth a great good, which alone mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
every thing that is heavy to be
light, and beareth equally all that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

any burthen, and maketh every
thing that is bitter to be sweet and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory.</p>
               <p>10 The noble loue of Iesus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth
man to worke great things, and
stirreth him up to desire alwaies the
most perfect.</p>
               <p>11 Love will be aloft, and not
kept downe with any abject things.
Love will be free, and a stranger to all
worldly affection.</p>
               <p>12 That his inward sight be not
obscured, that he be not intangled with
the desire of any transitory game: or
troubled with the want thereof.</p>
               <p>13 Nothing is sweeter then love,
nothing stronger, nothing higher, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more ample, nothing more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
nothing fuller nor better in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or in earth.</p>
               <p>14 For that love hath his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from God, and cannot rest but in
God above all creatures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:24022:105"/>
15 He that loveth, flyeth, runneth,
and rejoyceth; he is free and not held
in. He giveth all for all, and hath all in
all, for that he resteth in one Highest
above all, from which all good floweth,
and proceedeth.</p>
               <p>16 He respecteth not the gifts, but
turneth himselfe above all goods unto
the giver. Love oftentimes knoweth
no measure, but enflameth aboue all
measure.</p>
               <p>17 Love feeleth no burthen, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no paines, desireth above its
strength, complaineth not of impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
for that it thinketh all things
lawfull, and possible.</p>
               <p>18 It is therefore able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
all things, and performeth and
bringeth many things to effect: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he that doth not love, fainteth and
can doe nothing.</p>
               <p>19 Love alwaies watcheth, and
slumbring sleepeth not: being wearied,
is not tired: straitned is not pressed:
frighted, is not troubled: but like a

               <p>20 If any one loveth, he knowes
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:24022:105"/>
what this voice cryeth, a loud cry in the

               <p>25 Love is swift, sincere, pious,
sweet and delightfull: strong, patient,

and never seeking it selfe.</p>
               <p>26 For where one seeketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,

vaine things; sober, chast, constant,
quiet, and guarded in all the senses.</p>
               <p>27 Love is subject, and obedient
to Superiours, mean and abject to it
selfe, devout and thankfull unto God,
trusting and hoping alwaies in him, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
then when God imparteth no
sweetnesse unto it: for without sorrow
none liveth in love.</p>
               <p>28 He that is not ready to suffer
all things, and stande to the will of
his beloved, is not worthy to be called
a lover.</p>
               <p>29 A lover ought to imbrace wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
all that is hard, and distastfull for

               <p>5 A prudent lover considereth not

all gifts under his beloved.</p>
               <p>6 A noble lover resteth not in the

               <p>3 Consider every thing as flowing
from the highest good, and therefore
all things to be reduced unto me, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their

               <p>4 Out of me, as out of a living
fountaine, the litle and the great, the
poore and the rich, doe draw the water
of life, and they that willingly, and
freely serve me, shall receive grace for
grace.</p>
               <p>5 But he that will glory out of me,
or be delighted in any particular good
shall not be grounded in true joy, nor
enlarged in his heart, but shall be many
waies hindred and straitned.</p>
               <p>6 Thou oughtest therefore to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
no good unto thy selfe, nor attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
the praise of vertue unto any man,
but give all unto God, without whom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

7 I have bestowed all, and will
that all be returned to me againe: and
with great severity I require thanks.</p>
               <p>8 This is the truth that putteth to
flight vain-glory. And if heavenly grace,
and true charity enter in, there shall be
no envy nor grudging of heart, neither
shall there be any place for selfe-love.</p>
               <p>9 For divine charity overcommeth
all, and enlargeth all the forces of the
soule.</p>
               <p>10 If thou understand aright, in
me alone thou wilt rejoyce, in me alone
thou wilt hope: for none is good but
God alone, who is to be praised above
all, and to be blessed in all.</p>

               <p>3 So it is, Sonne, and my will is
not that thou seeke after that peace
which is void oftemptations, or that
feeleth no contrarieties;</p>
               <p>4 But then think that thou hast
found peace, when thou art exercised
with sundry tribulations, and tried in
many adversities.</p>
               <p>5 If thou say that thou art not able

if it be to thy honour, let this be done

occurreth unto thy mind to be desired,
let it be desired with the fear of God,
and with humility of heart.</p>
               <p>8 And above all thou oughtest to

doe this, or that, as thou pleasest.</p>

deale with me in all things according to

thou please.</p>
               <p>11 Behold I am thy servant, ready

               <p>7 For that thou, my Lord God,

               <p>10 For surely my heart cannot

               <p>11 O my most beloved spouse
Christ Iesus, the most chast lover, the

               <p>13 When shall I fully recollect my

feele my selfe, but thee alone, above
all sense, and feeling, in a manner not
commonly known.</p>
               <p>14 But now I oftentimes lament
and bear my infelicity with griefe:</p>
               <p>15 For that many evills occurre

               <p>17 To the end I should not have
free accesse unto thee, and that I should
not enjoy those sweet and heavenly
imbracings, which thou alwaies givest
to the blessed and celestiall spirits. Let
my sighs and manifold desolation on
earth moove thee.</p>
               <p>18 O Iesus, splendor of eternall

               <p>21 Thou art my joy, and without

               <p>4 I am lesse then the least of all

the least cannot be had.</p>

cannot glory of his owne desert, nor

               <p>9 And he that esteemeth himself

and he more, it is not ours, but thine
to determine, who dost weigh in just
measure the good behaviour of every

               <p>14 Wherefore my Lord God, I
esteeme it as a great benefit not to have

               <p>15 So that he, who considereth
his own poverty, and basenesse, ought
not therefore to conceave griefe, or
sorrow, or to be therefore troubled, but
rather to take great comfort, and to be
glad.</p>

                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:24022:130"/>
16 For that thou, O God, hast
chosen the poore and humble, and the
despised of this world for thy selfe,
and for thy familiar and domesticall
friends.</p>

griefe from whence soever it commeth,
as though all hope of delivery were
quite gone.</p>

although for a time I have sent thee
some tribulation, or withdrawne thy
desired comfort; for this is the way to
the Kingdome of heaven.</p>
               <p>20 And without doubt, it is more

               <p>21 I know the secret thoughts of

spirituall sweetnesse;</p>
               <p>21 Least perhaps thou shouldest
be puffed up with good successe, and
shouldest please thy selfe in that which

               <p>22 That which I have given, I can

               <p>5 When I give it, it is mine; when

doe passe from one to another.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of putting our trust in God, whom
evill words arise.</head>
               <p>SOnne, be constant, and put thy
trust in me: For what are words,
but words? They passe through the
aire, but hurt not. If thou be guilty, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
willingly to amend thy selfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
if thou be innocent, resolve to suffee
this willingly at least for God.</p>
               <p>2 It is a small matter to suffer
sometimes a few words, if thou hast
not yet the courage to endure stripes.</p>
               <p>3 And why doe small matters goe
to thy heart, but for that thou art yet
carnall, and regardest men more then
thou oughtest?</p>
               <p>4 Because thou art afraid to be
despised, therefore thou wilt not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
for thy faults, and therefore
seekest shadowes of excuses.</p>
               <p>5 But look better unto thy felfe
and thou shalt see, that the world yet
liveth in thee, and a vaine desire to
please men.</p>
               <p>6 For when thou refusest to be
humbled, and reproved for thy faults,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:24022:160"/>
it is surely evident, that thou art nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
truly humble, nor dead to the
world, nor the world perfectly crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to thee.</p>
               <p>7 But give diligent eare to my
words, and thou shalt litle respect ten
thousand words spoken by men</p>
               <p>8 Behold if all should be spoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thee that could be most malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
invented, what would it hurt
thee, if thou sufferedst it to passe, and
madest no reckoning at all of it? Could
all those words pluck as much as one
haire from thy head?</p>
               <p>9 But he that hath not his heart
within him, nor God before his eyes,
is easily moved with every litle dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praise,
when as he that trusteth in me,
and trusteth not in his own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
shall be free from humane
feares.</p>
               <p>10 For I am the Iudge and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerner
of all secrets: I know how the
matter passed, I know him that offereth
the injury, and him that suffereth it.</p>
               <p>11 From me hath this word pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
this hath happened by my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
that out of many hearts
thoughts may be revealed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:24022:160"/>
12 I shall judge the guilty and the
innocent, but by a secret judgement I
would before hand try them both.</p>
               <p>13 The testimony of men often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
deceaveth, my judgement is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
true, it shall stand and not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowne.</p>
               <p>14 It is commonly hidden and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
and not known in every thing but
to few; notwithstanding it never er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
neither can it erre, although to
the eyes of the foolish it seemes not
right.</p>
               <p>15 Men ought therefore to return
to me in every judgement, and not to
stand in their owne opinions.</p>
               <p>16 For the just man will not be
troubled, whatsoever happeneth unto
him from God: and if any thing be
wrongfully brought forth against him,
he will not much care, neither will he
vainely be glad, if by others he be with
reason excused.</p>
               <p>17 For he considereth that I am
he that searcheth the heart and reines,
and doe judge, not according to the
outward face, nor humane apparence.</p>
               <p>18 For that is oftentimes found

be thou my strength, and all my trust,

               <p>20 Thou knowest that which I

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:24022:166"/>
to my honour.</p>
               <p>10 For if thou judgest aright<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou
oughtest to preferre and follow my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
rather then thine owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
or any thing that can be desired.</p>
               <p>11 I know thy desire, and have
heard thy often groanes: Now thou
wouldest be in the freedome of the
glory of the Sonnes of God: now
doth the everlasting habitation, and the
heavenly Country full of joy delight
thee.</p>
               <p>12 But this houre is not yet come:
it is yet another time, to wit, a time of
warre, a time of labour and triall.</p>
               <p>13 Thou desirest to be filled with
the chiefest good, but thou canst not
attaine it for the present: I am he, saith
our Lord, expect untill the Kingdome
of God doth come.</p>
               <p>14 Thou art yet to be tried upon
earth, and to be exercised in many
things: Comfort shall be sometimes
given thee, but abundant fulnesse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
shall not be granted to thee.</p>
               <p>15 Take courage therefore, and
be valiant as well in doing as in suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
things contrary to nature: Thou
oughtest to put on a new man, and to
<pb facs="tcp:24022:166"/>
be changed into another man.</p>
               <p>16 Thou must oftentimes doe that
which thou wouldest not, and leave
undone that which thou wouldest: that
which is pleasing to others shall goe
well forwards, that which thou wishest
shall not speed.</p>
               <p>17 That which others say shall be
heard, what thou saist shall be nothing
regarded: Others shall aske and shall
receive, thou shalt aske and not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
               <p>18 Others shall be great in thc
praises of men, but of thee there shall
be no speech, to others this or that
shall be committed, but thou shalt be
accompted sit for nothing.</p>
               <p>19 At this nature will sometimes
repine, and it is much if thou endurest
it with silence.</p>
               <p>20 In these and such like, a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
servant of our Lord is wont to be
tried, how he can deny and overcome
himselfe in all things.</p>
               <p>21 There is scarce any thing,
wherein thou hast such need to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
thy selfe, as in seeing and suffering
those things that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>are contrary to thy

               <p>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:24022:167"/>
22 Especially when that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
which seemeth unto thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient,
or to little purpose.</p>
               <p>23 And for that thou being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
under authoritie, darest nor resist
higher power, therefore it seemeth
hard unto thee, to walke at the beck of
another, and to leave wholly thine own
opinion.</p>
               <p>24 But consider, Sonne, the fruit
of these labours, the end neare at hand,
and the reward above all measure, and
thou shalt receive no griefe there by, but
great comfort of thy patience.</p>
               <p>25 For in regard of that litle of
thy will which now thou willingly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sakest,
thou shalt alwaies have thy will
in heaven.</p>
               <p>26 There thou shalt have all that
thou wilt, or canst desire, there thou
shalt enjoy all good without feare of
loosing it, there shall thy will be ever
one with me; it shall desire nothing
strange or private.</p>
               <p>27 There no man shall withstand
thee, no man hinder thee, nothing come
against thee: but all things desired shall
be there together present, and refresh
thy whole affection, and fulfill it to the
highest.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:24022:167"/>
28 There I will returne thee glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for the reproach which here thou
sufferedst, a garment of praise for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
griefe; for the lowest place, a seat
of an everlasting Kingdome:</p>
               <p>29 There shall the fruit of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
appeare, the labour of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
rejoyce, and humble subjection
shall be gloriously crowned.</p>
               <p>30 Now therefore bow thy selfe
with great humility under the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nds of
all, and regard not who said, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
this.</p>
               <p>31 But take great heed, that whether
thy Superiour, or thy inferiour, or thine
equall require any thing of thee, or doe
insinuate their desire, thou take it all in
good part, and endeavour to fulfill it
with a sincere intention.</p>
               <p>32 Let one seeke this, another
that, let him glory in this, the other in
that, and be praised a thousand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times.</p>
               <p>33 But doe thou neither rejoyce in
this, not in that, but in the contempt of
thy selfe, and in the good pleasure and
honour of me alone.</p>
               <p>34 This art thou to wish, that
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:24022:168"/>
whether it be by life, or whether it be

               <p>7 But if thou withdraw thy selfe,

               <p>13 Holy Father, thou hast appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Thou oughtest therefore to cast away
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:24022:173"/>
all hinderances of grace, if thou desire
to receave the infusion thereof.</p>
               <p>2 Choose therefore a secret place
to thy selfe, love to live alone with thy
selfe, desire the conversation of none,
but rather powre out devout prayers
unto God, that thou maist keep thy

               <p>3 Esteem the whole world as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:

transitory vanities.</p>
               <p>4 Thou oughtest to sequester thy
selfe from thy acquaintance and
friends, and to keep thy mind deprived
of all temporall comfort.</p>
               <p>5 So the blessed Apostle Peter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
that the faithfull of Christ
should keep themselves as strangers &amp;

he have at the houre of death, whom
no affection to any earthly thing detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

               <p>7 But the weak minde is not yet

               <p>8 Notwithstanding if he will be
truly spirituall, he ought to renounce
as well those which are farre off, as
those which are neere unto him, and to
beware of no man more then of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
               <p>9 If thou perfectly overcome thy
selfe, thou shalt with more ease subdue
the rest. It is a glorious victory to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
over our selves.</p>
               <p>10 For he that keepeth himselfe
subject in such sort, that his sensuality
be subdued to reason, and reason in all

               <p>11 If thou desire to mount unto
this height of perfection, thou must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
manfully, and set the axe to the

               <p>12 Of this vice (that man too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately

dependeth, whatsoever is wholy to be

               <p>13 But for that few endeavour

upon all mankinde.</p>
               <p>6 In such sort, that nature it selfe,

for the infirmity of a corrupted nature,

which our own merits are nothing, and
no gifts of nature are to be esteemed!
Arts, riches, beauty, and strength, wit,
or eloquence are of no worth with thee
O Lord, without thy grace.</p>
               <p>16 For gifts of nature are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to good and evill, but the peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
gift of the elect is grace and love,
wherewith being marked, they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
worthy of everlasting life.</p>
               <p>17 This grace so much excelleth,
that neither the gift of prophesie, nor
the working of miracles, or any specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
how high soever, is of any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme
without it. Neither faith, nor
hope, nor other vertues are acceptable
unto thee without charity and grace.</p>
               <p>18 O most blessed grace, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
the poore in spirit rich in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
and the rich in many blessings,
humble in heart.</p>
               <p>19 Come downe unto me, reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
me in the morning with thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
lest my soule should faint with
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:24022:179"/>
wearinesse, and wither away with dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>20 I beseech thee Lord, that I
may find grace in thy sight, for thy
grace is sufficient for me, though other
things that nature desireth be wanting
unto me!</p>
               <p>21 If I be tempted and vexed with
many tribulations, I will not feare
these evils whilest thy grace is with
me? she is my strength, she giveth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
and helpe, she is stronger then all
enemies, and wiser then the wisest.</p>
               <p>22 Thy grace is the mistresse of
truth, the teacher of discipline, the light
of the heart, the solace in affliction.</p>
               <p>23 She driveth away sorrow, she
expelleth feare, she is the nurse of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the mother of teares.</p>
               <p>24 What am I without it, but a
rotten peece of wood, and an unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
stalke only meet for the fire?</p>
               <p>25 Let thy grace therefore, Lord,
alwaies prevent me, and follow me, &amp;
make me ever diligent in good works,
through Iesus Christ thy Sonne, Amen.</p>

the Saints, which of them is holier then
the other, and which shall be greater in

               <p>8 These things oftentimes breed
strife and unprofitable contentions,
they nourish also pride and vain-glory,
from whence doe usually spring envy
and dissentions:</p>
               <p>9 Whilest one endeavours to have
this, another to have that Saint vainly
preferred. To desire to know and
search our such things, is to no purpose,
but to displease the Saints.</p>
               <p>10 For I am not the God of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sension,
but of peace, which peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
rather in true humility, then in
exalting themselves.</p>
               <p>11 Some are carried with zeale of
affection, to love these, or those most,
but this love is rather humane then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</p>
               <p>12 I have made all the Saints: I
have given them my grace, I have
made them partakers of my glory: I

know the merits of every one, I have
prevented them in the benedictions of
my sweetnesse.</p>
               <p>13 <hi>I</hi> foreknew my beloved before

them out of the world, they chose not

               <p>14 I called them by grace, I drew
them by mercy, I led them through sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
temptations, I have sent them great
inward comforts, I have given them
perseverance, I have crowned their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>
               <p>15 I know the first and last: I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
all with inestimable love, I am to
be praised in all my Saints, I am to be
blessed above all things, and to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
in every one, whom I have thus

without any precedent merits of their

               <p>16 He therefore that contemneth
one of the least of my Saints, honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not the greatest, for that I made
both the lesse and the greater.</p>

               <p>22 They are alwaies much drawn

by a naturall affection, and humane
friendship to this man or to that, and
according to the experience they have
of themselves in their earthly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
so they frame an imagination of
heavenly.</p>
               <p>23 But there is an incomparable
distance between the things which the
imperfect frame in their conceipts, and
those which are illuminated doe see by
revelation from above.</p>
               <p>24 Beware therefore, my Sonne,
that thou treat not curiously of these
things, which exceed thy knowledge,
but rather so apply thy endeavours, that
thou maist at least have the meanest
place in the Kingdome of heaven.</p>
               <p>25 And if any one did know which
of the Saints exceeded others in sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or is esteemed greater in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heaven, what would this
knowledge avail him, unlesse he should
thereby humble himselfe the more in
my sight, and stirre up his mind to praise
my name with greater fervour.</p>
               <p>26 His labour is much more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable

of vertues, and how farre off he is from
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:24022:185"/>
the perfection of the Saints, ehen he
that disputeth of their greatnesse.</p>
               <p>27 It is better to labour after the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
&amp; devotion of the Saints, and with
an humble mind to imitate their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
examples, then to search their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
with vaine curiosity.</p>
               <p>28 They are wel &amp; right wel conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
if men could content themselves,
and refrain from these vain discourses.</p>
               <p>29 They glory not of their owne
merits, for they ascribe no good unto
themselves, but attribute all to me, who
of my infinite charity have bestowed my
blessings upon them.</p>
               <p>30 They are replenished with so
great love of my Godhead, and so su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabundant
joy, that there is no glory
that is, nor happinesse that can be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
unto them.</p>
               <p>31 All the Saints how much the
higher they be in glory, so much the
more humble they are in themselves, &amp;
nearer and dearer unto me.</p>
               <p>32 And therefore thou hast it writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,

               <p>3 I had rather choose to be a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim
in earth with thee, then to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse
heaven without thee: Where thou
art, there is heaven: and there is death
and hell, where thou art not.</p>
               <p>4 Thou art my desire, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it behoveth me to send forth deep
sighes from my heart, and cry and pray
unto thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:24022:187"/>
5 For I have none to trust unto,
none that can help me in time of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie,
but thee alone, my God: Thou
art my hope, and my trust, thou art my
comfort, and most faithfull unto me in
all my distresses.</p>
               <p>6 All men seeke their own gaine,
thou only seekest my salvation and my
profit, and turnest all things to my
good.</p>
               <p>7 Although thou permittest many
temptations to assault me, and many
adversities to befall me, yet thou ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
all this to my good and profit, who
art wont to prove thy beloved ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
a thousand waies.</p>
               <p>8 In which proofe thou oughtest
no lesse to beloved and praised, then
if thou didst replenish me with heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
comforts.</p>
               <p>9 In thee therefore, my Lord God,
I put my whole hope and refuge: in
thee I place my tribulation &amp; anguish;
for I find all to be weake and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
whatsoever I behold out of thee.</p>
               <p>10 For neither can many friends
availe, nor forcible helpers aide, nor
wise counsellours give profitable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
nor the books of the learned com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:24022:187"/>
nor any wealth deliver, nor any
secret, or pleasant place defend, if thou
thy selfe doest not assist, help, comfort,
instruct and keepe us.</p>
               <p>11 For all things that seeme to be
ordained for the rest and solace of man
when thou art absent are nothing, and
doe bring indeed no joy, nor comfort
at all.</p>
               <p>11 Thou therefore art the end of
all that is good, the light of life, the
depth of wisdome: and the most forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
comfort of thy servants, is to trust in
thee above all things.</p>
               <p>12 To thee therefore doe I lift up
mine eyes: In thee my God, the Father
of mercies I put my whole trust.</p>
               <p>13 Blesse and sanctifie my soule

               <p>22 Sith those holy ancient Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches,
and Prophets, yea Kings also &amp;
Princes with the whole people have
shewed so great zeale of devotion to
thy divine service.</p>
               <p>23 The most devout King David
danced before the Ark of God with all
his force, calling to mind the benefits
bestowed in times past upon his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers.</p>
               <p>24 He made instruments of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry

appointed them to be sung with joy:
himselfe also oftentimes plaied upon
the harpe.</p>
               <p>27 Being inspired with the grace
of the holy Ghost, he taught the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Israel to praise God with their

e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day to blesse and praise him.</p>
               <p>28 If so great devotion was then
used, and such memory of divine praise
before the Arke of the testament;</p>

29 What reverence and devotion
is now to be performed by me, and all
Christian people in the presence of
this Sacrament, in receiving of the
most precious Body of Iesus Christ?</p>
               <p>30 Many goe to sundry places to
visit the Reliques of Saints, and are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished
when they heare of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
worke:</p>
               <p>31 They behold the spacious
buildings of their Churches, and kisse
their sacred bones wrapped in silke and
gold:</p>
               <p>32 And behold thou art here pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sent
with me on the Altar, my God,
the Holy of Holies, the Maker of all
things, and Lord of Angels.</p>
               <p>33 Oftentimes in those devotions
there is but curiositie of men, and the
novelty of the beholders in the seeing
of such sights, and litle fruit of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is gotten thereby, especially
where there is so unconstant wandring
without true contrition:</p>
               <p>34 But here in the Sacrament of
the Altar, thou art present, my Lord,
God and Man, Christ Iesus, where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
plentifull fruit of, everlasting salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is obtained, as often as thou art
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:24022:192"/>
worthly and devoutly received.</p>
               <p>35 No levity, no curiosity, or sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality
draweth unto this, but firme
faith, devout hope, and sincere cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
               <p>36 O God the invisible Creator
of the world, how wonderfully doest
thou deale with us, how sweetly and
graciously doest thou dispose of all
things with thine elect, to whom thou
offerest thy selfe to be received in the
Sacrament.</p>
               <p>37 O this exceedeth all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of man: this chiefly draweth
the hearts of the devout, and inflameth
their desire!</p>
               <p>38 For thy true faithfull servants
that dispose their whole life to amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
oftentimes receive great grace of
devotion, and love of vertue.</p>
               <p>39 O admirable and hidden grace
of this Sacrament, which only the faith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full
of Christ doe know: but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull,
and such as are slaves unto
sin, canot conceive nor feele.</p>
               <p>40 In this Sacrament spirituall
grace is given, and lost vertue is resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the soule: and beauty disfigured
by sin returneth againe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:24022:192"/>
41 This grace is sometimes so
great, that with the fulnesse of devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is here given, not only the
mind, but the weake body also feeleth
great increase of strength.</p>
               <p>42 Our coldnesse and negligence
surely is much to be bewailed and pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied,
that we are not drawne with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
affection to receive Christ, in whom
all the hope and reward of those that
are to be saved doth consist.</p>
               <p>43 For hee is our sanctification
and redemption: he is the comfort of
passengers, and the everlasting fruition
of Saints.</p>
               <p>44 It is much therefore to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
that many doe so litle consider
this comfortable mysterie, which rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
heaven, and preserveth the whole
world.</p>
               <p>45 Oblindnesse and hardnesse of
mans heart, that doth not the more
deeply weigh the greatnesse of so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
gift, but rather comes by the
daily use thereof, to regard it litle or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>46 For if this most holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
should be celebrated in one place
only, &amp; consecrated by one only Priest
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:24022:193"/>
in the world, with how great desire
doest thou think would men be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to that place?</p>
               <p>47 And what esteeme would they
have of such a Priest of Almighty God,
by whom they might enjoy the conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of these divine mysteries.</p>
               <p>48 But now there are many Priests,
and Christ is offered up in many places
that so the grace and love of God to
man may appeare so much the greater,
hovv much the more this sacred Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
is common through the world.</p>
               <p>49 Thankes be unto thee, good
Iesu, everlasting Pastour of our soules,
that hast vouchsafed to refresh us poore
and banished men, with thy precious
Body and Blood!</p>

how unspeakable thy truth! For thou
saidst the word, and all things were
made, and this was done which thou
commandest.</p>
               <p>17 A thing of great admiration,
and worthy of faith, and surpassing the
understanding of man, that thou, my
Lord God, true God &amp; Man, shouldst
be exhibited unto us by the elements
of bread and wine, and thy body wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
receaved should be the spirituall
food of our soule.</p>
               <p>18 Thou who are the Lord of
all things, and standest in need of
none, hast pleased to dwell in us by
meanes of this thy Sacrament.</p>
               <p>19 Preserve my heart and body
unspotted, that with a cheerefull and
pure conscience, I may often celebrate
thy mysteries, and receave them to my
everlasting health, which thou hast
chiefly ordained and instituted for thy
honour, and perpetuall memory.</p>
               <p>20 Rejoyce O my soule, and give
thankes unto God for so noble a gift
and singular comfort, left unto thee in
this vale of teares!</p>

21 For as often as thou callest to
mind this mystery, and receavest the
body of Christ, so often dost thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the worke of thy redemption,
and art made partaker of all the merits
of Christ.</p>
               <p>22 For the charity of Christ is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
diminished, and the greatnesse of
his mercy is never drawne dry.</p>
               <p>23 Therefore thou oughtest al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
to dispose thy selfe hereunto by
a fresh renewing of thy minde, and to
weigh with attentive consideration this
great mystery of thy salvation.</p>
               <p>24 So great, now, and joyfull it
ought to seeme unto thee, when thou
commest to the holy Communion, as if

For besides thee no comfort is
availeable, I cannot be without thee,
nor live without thy gracious visitation.</p>
               <p>7 And therefore I must often
come unto thee, and receave thee as
the only remedy of my health, lest
perhaps I faint in the way, if I be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived

               <p>8 For so, most mercifull Iesus,
thou once didst say, preaching to the
people, and curing sundry diseases, I
will not send them home fasting, lest
they faint in the way.</p>
               <p>9 Deale thou therefore in like

of everlasting glory.</p>
               <p>11 It is necessary for me, that doe
so often fall and sinne, so quickly waxe
dull and faint, that by often prayers

my selfe, lest perhaps by long

               <p>12 For man is prone unto evill

               <p>13 This holy communion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
draweth back from evill, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth

               <p>14 For if I be now so often slack
and negligent when I communicate or
officiate, what would become of mee,
if I receaved not this remedy, &amp; sought
not after so great helpe.</p>
               <p>15 Though every day I be not sit,
not well prepared to communicate, I
will endeavour notwithstanding at
convenient times to receave the divine
mysteries, and make my selfe partaker
of so great a grace.</p>

of Angels.</p>
               <p>3 A great mystery, and great is the

               <p>5 The Priest is the Minister of

of God, but God is there the principal
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:24022:201"/>
Author, and invisible Worker, to whom
is subject all that he pleaseth, and all
that he commandeth, doth obey.</p>
               <p>6 Thou oughtest therefore to

               <p>7 Consider attentively with thy
selfe, and see what that is, whereof the
Ministry is delivered unto thee by the
imposition of the hands of the Bishop.</p>
               <p>8 Behold thou art made a Priest,

but are now bound with a straiter
bond of discipline, and art obliged to a
more perfect degree of sanctity.</p>
               <p>10 A Priest ought to be adorned
with all kind of vertues, and to give ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of good life to others.</p>
               <p>11 His conversation should not be
according to the ordinary and common
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:24022:201"/>
proceedings of men, but like to the
Angels in heaven, or to perfect men on
earth.</p>
               <p>12 A Priest clothed in sacred gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
is the Vicegerent of Christ, to
pray humbly, and with a prostrate
mind unto God for himselfe and the
whole people.</p>
               <p>13 And know that he is placed as
a modiatour betweene God and the
sinner: Neither ought he to cease from
praior and holy oblation, till he obtaine
grace and mercy.</p>
               <p>14 When a Priest doth celebrate,
he honoureth God, rejoyceth the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
edlfieth the Church, helpeth the

all good deeds.</p>

that nothing remained in me that was

thy selfe willingly unto me daily, as a
pure and holy oblation, with thy whole
force and desire, in as hearty manner as
thou canst.</p>
               <p>3 What doe I require of thee more
then that thou resigne thy selfe wholly

so neither can it please me whatsoever

               <p>18 How happy is he and gratefull

keepeth his conscience in such purity,
that he may be ready and fit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
every day, if it were coveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

the Body of his Redeemer,
and rather seeke the honour and glory
of God, then his own comfort.</p>
               <p>24 For he communicateth mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,

presence, and with devout Magdalen
to wash thy feet with the teares of
mine eyes.</p>
               <p>4 But where is this devotion? where
is so plentifull shedding of holy teares?
Surely in the sight of thee and thy holy
Angels, my whole heart should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
and dissolve into teares for
joy.</p>
               <p>5 For I enjoy thee in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
truly present, though darkned &amp;
in a shadow.</p>
               <p>6 For to behold thee in thine own
divine brightnesse, mine eyes would
not be able to endure it, neither could
the whole world stand in the cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the glory of thy Majesty.</p>
               <p>7 I doe really enjoy and adore
him whom the Angels adore in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but I as yet for the time in faith,
they in his proper forme, and without
shadow.</p>
               <p>8 I ought to be contented with
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:24022:210"/>
the light of true faith, and to walke
therein, untill the day of everlasting
brightnesse break forth, and the shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
of figures passe away.</p>
               <p>9 But when that shall come
which is perfect, the use of Sacraments
shall cease: For the blessed in heavenly
glory need not the remedy of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
who rejoyce without end in
the presence of God:</p>
               <p>10 Beholding his glory face to
face, and being transformed by his
brightnesse, into the brightnesse of the
incomprehensible Deity, they tast the
word of God made flesh, as he was
from the beginning, and as he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for ever.</p>
               <p>11 Whilest I remember these
wonderfull works, even all spirituall
comfort whatsoever becometh very te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
unto me: for that as long as I
behold not my Lord openly in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
I make no accompt of whatsoever
I see or heare in this life.</p>
               <p>12 Thou art my witnesse, O
God, that nothing can comfort me, no
creature give me rest, but thou my God,
whom I desire to behold everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:24022:211"/>
13 But this is not possible whilest
I remaine in this mortall life, therefore
I must frame my selfe to much pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and submit my selfe to thee in all
my desires.</p>
               <p>14 For thy Saints also, O Lord,
who now rejoyce with thee in the
Kingdome of heaven, whilest they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
expected in faith and great pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
the comming of thy glory.</p>
               <p>15 What they believed, I believe,
what they hoped for, I expect; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they are come, I trust by thy grace
I shall also come.</p>
               <p>16 In the meane time I will goe
forward in faith, strengthened by the
examples of the Saints.</p>
               <p>17 I have also devout bookes for
my comfort, and for the guide of my
life, and above all these, thy most holy
Body for a singular remedy and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>18 For I perceive two things to
be chiefly necessary for me in this life,
without which this miserable life
would be insupportable unto me.</p>
               <p>19 Whilest I am kept in the prison
of this body, I acknowledge my selfe
to stand in need of two things, to wit,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:24022:211"/>
food, and light.</p>
               <p>29 Thou hast therefore given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, weak creature, thy sacred Body
for the refection of my soule &amp; body,
and hast set thy word as a light unto
my feet.</p>
               <p>30 Without these two I could not
well live: For the word of God is the
light of the soule, and thy Sacrament,
the bread of life.</p>
               <p>31 These also may be called the
two tables set on the one side and the
other, in the store-house of the holy
Church.</p>
               <p>32 One is the table of the holy
Altar, containing the sacred bread,
that is, the precious body of Christ:</p>
               <p>33 The other is of the divine law,
containing holy doctrine, teaching true
faith, and certainly leading to the part
of the Temple within the veile, where
are the Holy of Holies.</p>

presently given, and at hand ever with

               <p>6 Therefore devotion is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected

thy sinnes, when it is not given thee,

               <p>8 And if thou remove this, be it
great or small, and perfectly overcome
it, thou shalt have thy desire.</p>
               <p>9 For presently as soone as thou
givest thy selfe to God with thy whole

thine own pleasure or will, but setlest

thy selfe united unto him, and quiet.</p>
               <p>10 For nothing will tast so well,
and please thee so much, as the good
will and pleasure of almighty God.</p>
