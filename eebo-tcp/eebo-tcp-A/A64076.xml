            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S Magiſtracy, that excellent ordinance of God (whereon
much of his Soveraign Majeſty and glory is impreſſed) is
not amongſt the ſmalleſt priviledges of the ſons of men;
they being thereby not only preſerv'd in their well and
better being, but even in their real and true being; injoying thereby,
not only Religion, Right and Property, but even life, freedome
and ſafety from all the other inconveniences in the world; and that
whileſt theſe due bounds and limits, which God has appointed in his
Word, and given men to know by reaſon, are ſo ſtrictly obſerv'd,
that Magiſtracy is thereby preſerv'd; ſo, when through the breach
thereof there is a full perverſion into Tyranny, that, which once was
the greateſt priviledge and bleſſing, does then become the greateſt
miſery and curſe, according to that maxime, <hi>corruptio optimi ſemper
peſſima.</hi> But ſuch a plague (and ſo much the greater, that the world
hath bin rather doteing on, then ſeeking a remedie againſt it) hath
overtaken this generation, that very properly an alluſion to that of
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> may take place, <hi>Iſai. 44. ver. 16. Where he ſpeaks of ſuch as take
a peece of wood and burn part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth
flesh: roſteth roſt and is ſatisfied; yea he warmeth himſelf and ſayeth Aha,
I am warme, I have ſeen the fire. And the reſidue thereof he maketh a God,
even his graven Image; he falleth down unto it and worshipeth it, and
prayeth unto it, and ſayeth, deliver me; for thou arte my God.</hi> Such
hath bin the madneſs and folly, even of the true Chriſtian world, that
they have ſet up perſons moſt unfit for Government; and inlarged
their power beyond the due limites, that tyranny and oppreſſion in
the very abſtract has bin viſible both in their perſons and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and yet worshiped as ſo many Idols, and all abſolute obedience
and non-reſiſtance pleaded for, to an abſolute power and tyranny.
One great reaſon whereof is, that fooliſh notion of the ſacredneſs of
power in poſſeſſion, never inquiring into right and title; and the
due diſtance, diſtinction and boundaries of Magiſtracy, and Tyranny,
that are as ſpecifically diſtinct, as right and robry: honeſty and kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very:
a bleſſing and a curſe. Hence nothing would be more uſefull
and advantageous to the world, then to be induced to a ſerious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie,
how theſe are to be diſtinguished by their true characters. And
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36588:3"/>
that the matter may be the more clearly illuſtrate, the queſtion shall
be ſtated thus;</p>
            <p>What is it, that makes a juſt and lawfull King, or Magiſtrate, and
doth continue them ſuch.</p>
            <p>The which queſtion shall be anſwered; firſt, negatively, and then
poſitively: Negatively, by removing what it is that doth not: po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively,
in a plaine aſſerting and proveing what it is that doth. In
the negative part, there are theſe two would be removed; firſt, that
it is conqueſt that doth it; and ſecondly, that it is an hereditory title
that doth it.</p>
            <p>That conqueſt is not that which doth it, will eaſily be granted by
all men; for a man by violence may mount a Throne, and yet be no
juſt and lawfull King. <hi>Abſolom</hi> did mount the throne, and yet was no
juſt and lawfull King, as in 11 <hi>Sam. 15. Chapt.</hi> more particularly it is
to be obſerved in the 19. ver. <hi>where David deſigns him by the title of
King, which in effect was only an uſurped title, he having come to it only
by violence and robry.</hi> Zimri <hi>did the ſame, and yet was no juſt and lawfull
King,</hi> as in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16. from the 9. <hi>ver. we find his conſpiracy againſt his
maſter and killing of him: and after his eſtablishment upon the Throne, a
deſtroying of all the houſe of</hi> Baasha, and in ver. 16. <hi>when the people heard
thereof, they made</hi> Omri <hi>King over Iſrael in the Camp,</hi> and in the 17,
and 18, <hi>ver.</hi> Omri <hi>purſued him, and took the City, ſo that</hi> Zimri <hi>went
into the Palace of the Kings houſe and burnd' the ſame over him with fire.</hi>
Athaliah <hi>deſtroyed alſo all the ſeed Royall of the houſe of Judah, and by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
took poſſeſſion of the power,</hi> as in 2 Chron. 22. ver. 10, 12. <hi>And yet</hi>
Joash <hi>is made King, and she deſtroyed;</hi> as in the following Chapter 12,
13, 14, <hi>ver.</hi> Many more examples of this nature might be added: but we
shall only ſay this by way of argument, and ſo have done; that ſeeing
neither the word of God, nor reaſon does command, or allow a King,
or any other Magiſtrate to mount a Throne, and accordingly to take
poſſeſſion of the power by violence, and that it would be a thing of
moſt dangerous effects, if the minds of people should be poſſeſt with
any ſuch principle; (for there is ſuch a luſt and propenſity in the hearts
of men to govern, that they would ſeek out all occaſion to deſtroy the
very beſt of Magiſtrates; and thereby the people might be robbed of
the very beſt of Governours and Government: for the ſame principle
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36588:3"/>
that makes a man uſurp a power, makes him alſo uſurp an unjuſt and
unlawfull power,) it's evident that conqueſt makes not a good right.
Now this being ended, our next is to inquire into that of an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory
title, and we shall ſtate the argument thus;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether or not doth an hereditory title really in it ſelf give
a full and real power to a King, and thereby make him a juſt, and
lawfull Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That which neither in it ſelf, nor by the Law of God, nor
reaſon is neceſſar, or eſſentiall to the being of a King, can never make
a King; but an hereditory title neither in it ſelf, nor by the Law of
God, nor reaſon is neceſſar, or eſſentiall to the being of a King;
therefore hereditory title can never make a King. The major I hope
none will deny; the minor I prove thus; as for the firſt part of it,
Viz: that an hereditory title in it ſelf, doth not make &amp;c. It is clear
that hereditory title in it ſelf, dot not make a King, or then Kings
could never have bin made without it, but Kings have, are, and may
be made without it, Ergo &amp;c. And as for the latter part, that the
word of God, nor reaſon does not allow of it, nor command it, I
prove thus,</p>
            <p>That which doth expreſly thwart and contradict the word of God
and reaſon, muſt be inconſiſtant with the word of God and reaſon;
but that an hereditory title should be neceſſar and eſſential, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
make a King doeth expreſly thwart and contradict the word of
God and reaſon, ergo &amp;c. which I prove thus,</p>
            <p>The word of God, and reaſon do expreſly command and allow
that a Magiſtrate should have ſuitable qualifications for the office, as in
<hi>Deutr.</hi> 17. from <hi>ver.</hi> 15. there the qualifications of a King are held forth
and commanded; I shall only mention one of thoſe, which is this,
that he should not be a ſtranger born: which does clearly import that
he should not be of a ſtrange Religion; for the reaſon why the Lord
did lay ſuch ſtrict commands upon his people not to marry with ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
was not but that they had the bodies of men and women as
good as they, but that they were of a ſtrange Religion and might
draw them away to Idolatry; and ſeeing the word of God does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
command theſe qualifications as neceſſar and eſſential, certainly
reaſon does command and allow that a people should have a reſpect to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36588:4"/>
the glory of God, their own good and ſafety, and accordingly make
non King, but ſuch as have theſe neceſſar and eſſentiall qualifications:
but that hereditory title, (which many do boaſt of,) does allow and
eſſentially make him a King, whether he have theſe qualifications,
or not; though he should be born a monſter and not a man; a mad
man and not a ſober man; a fool and an ideot, and not a wiſe man;
a ſtranger and of a ſtrange Religion, and not a native, nor of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of the Land; yea though he were given to all manner of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs,
yet he is ſaid to be a born King, and accordingly the Lords
anointed: wich is altogether inconſiſtant with the word of God and
reaſon. But that we may give ſatisfaction more fully to all perſons
concerning this matter, let us inquire yet a little further into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of this hereditory title, who it is that gives this title and what it
is they can give. I know that ſome of the vil'd of the earth, who
would flatter Princes and cheat the people out of their rights and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
do plainly ſay, that it is God only gives it, and that all Kings
have their right and power only, and immediatly from God and ſo
are accomptable to non but God. I would gladly know where thoſe
Kings got theſe ladders, by which they went up to Heaven to get
thoſe rights devolved upon them, and their Families, or if there be
ſuch a thing recorded in Scripture, that ſuch and ſuch men should by
an hereditory title Reign as Kings on the earth, and in ſuch and ſuch
parts of the world, or if this right of reigning muſt only and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
flow from the people. There is nothing more certain than, that
it is the gift of the people, if it be not the effect of conqueſt, which is
already ſpoke to, and excluded. And therefore we shall next conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what a people can give, and what the extent of this hereditory
title can be. And it muſt be underſtood, that a people can give no
more then they have to give, which is, that if they be perſons ſo
and ſo qualified for the office; then they shall be preferred before
others to ſuch an office: but if a people should abſolutely ſay and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
that ſuch a race and Family should be their born Kings, that
were to take Gods power unto them; for it is not in their power to
bring ſuch a thing to paſs in reſpect of theſe many natural accidents
that are in the way, yea it were the very way to make themſelves ſlaves;
and to bring that curſe upon them, that is there threatned in, <hi>Hoſ: 8.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36588:4"/>
ver.</hi> 3, 4. and accordingly to forfeit Gods protection. So that the
extent of this hereditory title being only a promiſe in the people that
ſuch a race shall ſucceed to ſuch an office being qualified for the ſame,
it muſt of neceſſity follow that the people muſt be Judges of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
for no forraign power can determine therein, the people being
only and immediatly concerned therein. Let us now go to the caſe of
<hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and there we find, though <hi>Saul</hi> had Gods abſolute
promiſe for it from the mouth of the Prophete (for non can make an
abſolute promiſe of this nature, but God only) and that alſo the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete
did confirme the ſame unto him by anointing him with oyle,
and telling him whome, and what he shoud meet with by the way;
yet all this did not make him King: for this was only a ſecret
act of the Prophete, whereby he did make known Gods minde and
promiſe unto him; for when <hi>Saul</hi> was made King, the people were
gathered together for that purpoſe, and preſented before the Lord by
their trybes and by their thouſands: and when <hi>Saul</hi> was taken by lot,
he was lying hidde amongſt the ſtuffe, being it ſeemes affrayed and
doubtfull, whether he should be choſen King, or not; as you shall find
in 1 <hi>Sam. 10. ver.</hi> 20, 21, 23. And accordinly <hi>David, though he had the
Lords promiſe in the ſame manner, yet he was not really King for many
years after, until the death of</hi> Saul; <hi>and he was firſt made King of Judah;
and did Reign ſeven years and ſix moneths, before he was made King over
Iſrael, until all the tribes went to him in Horeb, and</hi> David <hi>made a League
with them, and then they anointed him King over Iſrael.</hi> Now ſeeing we
finde clearly the Lords promiſe (which was abſolute) was not that
which did really make them Kings, far leſs doth the lame promiſe of
the people do it, which (we have made manifeſt already) may come
to nothing. I know ſome do alleadge that there was an hereditory right
ſettled upon the houſe of <hi>David:</hi> but we finde that it was only a ſecret
promiſe of God to <hi>David</hi> upon conditions, that if he and his family
should keep Gods Covenant, then the Lord in his providence would
ſo order it, that there should not be one of the family wanting to ſit,
upon the Throne, and this promiſe was not made to <hi>David</hi> ſimply as
he was a King; for then it should rather have bin made to the houſe of
<hi>Saul;</hi> becauſe he was before him: for God did bleſs him with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
bleſſings that no King on earth can pretend to; as his being a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:36588:5"/>
Prophete, and Chriſts coming out of his race. Yea that Prophecy
and bleſſing of <hi>Jacob</hi> to his Children in the 49. of Geneſis, ver. 10.
<hi>The Scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a Lawgiver from between
his feet, until Shiloh come,</hi> was fulfilled in the perſon of <hi>David</hi> and his
houſe; as vve shall finde by <hi>Davids</hi> ovvn vvords in 1 Chron: 28. ver. 4.
<hi>Howbeit the Lord God of Iſrael choſe me before all the houſe of my Fathers
to be King over Iſrael for ever: for he hath choſen Judah to be the ruler;
and of the houſe of Judah the houſe of my father; and amongſt the ſons of
my father he liked me, to make me King over all Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> I knovv
ſome do alleadge this hereditory title to be the abſolute promiſe and
gift of the people and therefore becomes as really the right, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of that race and family, to vvhom it is given, as any other
eſtate does go-from father to ſon. Although there be anough ſayd
both from Scripture, and reaſon ſufficiently to anſvver the ſame, yet
vve shall come to matter of practice in theſe Nations, vvhere this
hereditory title has bin moſt in uſe. And in the firſt place, vve shall
conſider the reaſon of this hereditory title, the title it ſelf, and the
practice of the people concerning thoſe, to vvhome it did belong.</p>
            <p>As for the reaſon thereof, there can be no other reaſon given then
this, that often times families fell a contending for the Government
and thereby the sheding of blood vvas occaſioned, and therefore the
people (to take avvay this inconvenience) thought fit to ſettle the title
to an office upon a particular race.</p>
            <p>As for the title ſelf, though the very vvords granting it, may ſeem
to be abſolute, admitting of no condition, or qualification vvhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomever;
yet it cannot be thought, that any Nation vvho knevv any
thing of a God, much leſs a Chriſtian Nation, and of the Reformed
Religion vvould ever ſet the povver and providence of God ſo at
nought, as not to reſpect the ſame in the doing of this very thing:
for though men do frequently ſay, that they vvill go ſuch avvay, or
do ſuch a thing, yet it is alvvays underſtood, that they do reſpect
the povver and providence of God in this matter, that they neither
can go any vvay, or do any thing, vvithout God concur vvith them
in giving them thoſe neceſſar qualifications, as health, ſtrength, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and underſtanding; and every vvay make his povver and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
good for them therein. So it muſt be underſtood of ſuch a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36588:5"/>
vvhen they give ſuch a right, that as they are lead by ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for the doing thereof, ſo they do not intend thereby to deſtroy
reaſon, Religion and nature, and accordingly to ſet the povver and
providence of God at nought. For it vvere againſt reaſon, Religion
and nature, and a defying of Gods povver and providence for a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to give up themſelves blindfoldedly to ſuch a race, in ſuch an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
manner as that. And as for the practice of the people concerning
thoſe to vvhome this title did belong, vve shall find, that in Scotland,
England and other parts of the vvorld, vvhen the people did find
that thoſe perſons, to vvhome this hereditory title did immediatly
belong, were unqualified for the office, that they have taken it from
them, and given it to the next in line being more qualified for the
ſame. Now if this promiſe and gift had bin ſo abſolute, as ſome do
ſay, ſo as that theſe perſons by their birth had bin Juſt and lawfull
Kings, it had not bin in their power to have taken the ſame from them.
But ſeeing we have ſaid anough from Scripture, reaſon and the practice
of the people to prove that this hereditory title neither in it ſelf, nor
by the Law of God, or reaſon, is neceſſar, or eſſentiall to the makeing
of a King; and that it is inconſiſtant with the word of God &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that a King can be made thereby; let us now conſider what it
is that doth really make a Juſt and lawfull King, and continue him
ſuch.</p>
            <p>It is neceſſar to be conſidered, that no ſupreme Magiſtrate comes
juſtly to the power without the call and election of the people; and
that the people are to call and elect non, but ſuch as have thoſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſar
and eſſentiall qualifications.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that he be a man; and not a monſter. Secondly, that he be a
prudent, wiſe and ſober man; and not a fool, an Ideot, or a mad
man. Thirdly, that he be of the true Religion of the Land; and not
of a ſtrange Idolatrous Religion. Fourthly, that he be Juſt and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.
I know, no rational man will object againſt the firſt two, and
therefore I shall labour only to prove the abſolute neceſſity of the laſt;
that he be of the true Religion of the Land; and not of a ſtrange,
Idolatrous Religion: and I do it thus; Firſt, the Lord has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
it in his Word; ſecondly, reaſon does alſo injoyn it. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
from the bad conſequences that may follow, if it be not. Now
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:36588:6"/>
that the Lord has commanded it, is clear from that of <hi>Deut. 17. ver.</hi>
14. It is like ſome will object, that this command was judiciall and
only binding upon the Jewes, they being more immediatly under
Gods own Government: but if the Text of Scripture be conſidered,
there can be no ſuch miſtake: for this is a Government common to
other Nations, to which God grantes them a liberty, theſe due mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
being obſerved, which a people, or Nation (who do worship
the true God in the true manner) ought to ſecure their Religion and
liberty by. Now that reaſon does injoyn it muſt natively follow; for
that people, who would ſecure their Religion and Liberty, could
not at all be accompted men of reaſon, if they should ſet up an Idolater
to be their King. For it is too well known to the true Chriſtian world
that no bondes can binde an Idolater, (eſpecially a Papiſt) who by
the nature of his Religion and theſe his religious vowes, does not
only ſtand at liberty, but obliedged upon all occaſions to break all
vowes and Oaths whatſomever, to thoſe of the true Religion, when
it does in any meaſure prove conſiſtent with the deſtruction of the true
Religion, and the advancement of Idolatrie: and it muſt alſo follow,
that the worſt of conſequences will attend thereupon. For thereby a
people are guilty of rebellion againſt God by not obſerving, but rather
forſakeing thoſe due meaſures, that the word of God and reaſon has
commanded, and do accordingly forfeit Gods protection: and it muſt
of neceſſity be ſaid, that they have caſt off that which is good, and
that the enemies shall purſue them, as it is ſayd of that people, <hi>Hoſ.
8. ver.</hi> 3, 4. And as the worſt of miſery muſt follow thereupon, ſo it
muſt be acknowledged, that they have brought it on with their own
hands. And ſo long as they continue unpenitent for this their rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
againſt God, and treachery to their native Land, they can not
pray with hopes that God will either help, or relieve them out of
their miſery.</p>
            <p>And that he be Juſt and upright, is moſt abſolutely neceſſar: for
that Magiſtrate, who is not Juſt and upright in his office, can no
more be ſaid to be a Juſt and lawfull Magiſtrate, then a thiefe, or a
murtherer can be ſaid to be an honeſt man. <hi>David</hi> in his laſt words
gives this as a thing moſt abſolutely neceſſar and eſſentiall to the real
and true being of a Magiſtrate, in 2 <hi>Sam. 23. ver. 3. The God of Iſrael
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:36588:6"/>
ſaid, the rock of Iſrael ſpoke to me, he that ruleth over men, muſt be
Juſt, ruleing in the fear of God:</hi> This Text of Scripture does not ſay,
that it is neceſſar he should be Juſt, ſo as he might be the better Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
(for that were only neceſſar to the well being of a Magiſtrate)
but that he muſt be Juſt, ſo as without it he cannot at all be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
a lawfull Magiſtrate: and accordingly <hi>Jethro, Moſes</hi> Father in
law gives this alſo, as a thing moſt abſolutely neceſſar and eſſentiall
to the true being of a Magiſtrate, <hi>Exod. 18. ver. 21. Moreover thou
shalt provide out of all the people, able men; ſuch as fear God: men of
truth, hating covetouſneſs, and place ſuch over them &amp;c.</hi> And it is a
thing well known to all the world, that the want of this can not be
diſpenced with in any manner of employment whatſomever: for the
meaneſt treadsman is obliedged to be Juſt and upright, or if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
he be found to malverſe in his office, by cheating of people, he
can no more be looked upon as a Juſt and lawfull treadſman, but a
cheat and a rogue. Now as it is moſt certain that the electing and
chooſeing of a King is the proper, true, Juſt, and radicall power of
the people, and that they for their convenience, further good, and
ſafety do chuſe a King, ſo for their convenience they do not now
meet by their tribes and thouſands, as in the days of old: but do chuſe
their repreſentatives, and the repreſentatives the King. So that if the
repreſentatives malverſe, the people may call them to an accompt, and
if the King malverſe, the repreſentatives may call him to an accompt;
and if both malverſe, the people may call both to an accompt: for
both are choſen for the convenience, good and ſafety of the people
&amp; derive their power only, and immediatly from them, as the only
qualified under God for giveing the ſame unto them.</p>
            <p>Now it is to be conſidered, when a people do call and chuſe a
King, that there are termes and conditions agreed upon by borh par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
the people they do convoy and give into his hands the Juſt and
lawfull power of the ſupreme office in the ſtate, and accordingly he
does receive the ſame from them, promiſing faithfully to hold, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs,
or uſe no other unlawfull or tyrannicall power: but by vertue of
that Juſt and lawfull power, to maintain and preſerve all thoſe rights
and priviledges; wherewith God has bleſſed them, both ſacred and
civill, and as the peoples Magiſtrate to exerciſe the ſame for the glory
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:36588:7"/>
of God and their good and ſafety: for there is nothing more certain,
then that all Magiſtrates whatſomever are really ordained of God, and
do receive their power from the people to miniſter thereby for their
good; and accordingly the people do promiſe to maintaine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſend
them as ſuch; This appears further from 1 <hi>Kings 12. ver.</hi> 7. The
old men, when they gave their advice to <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> it was to this
purpoſe; <hi>And they ſpoke unto him, ſaying, if thou wilt be a ſervant unto
this people this day, and wilt ſerve them; and anſwer them, and ſpeake
good words to them; then they will be thy Servants for ever.</hi> Now when
this man, who is to be their Magiſtrate, has this power convoyd
unto him by the people, and does promiſe to the people; to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
preſerve and accordingly to act by vertue of the ſame, it muſt
neceſſarly follow that he is either really ſincere and upright in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakeing
and promiſing, his heart being fully determined to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with the minde and purpoſe of the people, and accordingly to
become the Miniſter of God for good to the people, having nothing
elſe before his eyes but the glory of God, the good and ſafety of the
people, over whome he has that charge, or then he is fals and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous,
and does only diſſemble with them, takeing occaſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
only to poſſeſs himſelf of the power, that then he may act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
the purpoſe of his own wicked heart; if he be real and ſincere
in his promiſes to the people, there is nothing more certain then that
he is a Juſt and lawfull Magiſtrate; but if otherways he be fals and
treacherous, and does only take occaſion by his thus receiveing of the
power, to change the ſame unto an unjuſt, unlawfull, arbitrary,
wicked and tyrannicall power, and accordingly to rob them of their
rights and priviledges, both ſacred and civill at his pleaſure, then he
can not at all be ſaid to be a Juſt and lawfull Magiſtrate, but a deceiver
and a tyrant: for a people can do no more, then put a Juſt and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
power in his hand; and accordingly to cloath and poſſeſs him with
the ſame: but it ſtill remains that God give him that grace of juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and uprightneſs to maintain, preſerve and accordingly to act by
vertue of the ſame, as <hi>Prov. 8. ver. 15, 16. By me Kings Reign and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
decree Juſtice. 16. By me Princes rule and Nobles, even all the Judges
of the earth.</hi> Now, though there may be ſome that pervert and wreſt
this Scripture to a proveing that Kings have their power immediatly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36588:7"/>
from God, yet the true meaning of it is, that a King being lawfully
choſen and ſet up by the people, it's God that gives him the Spirit of
Government, whereby he is in a capacity to exerciſe that function,
whereinto he is firſt inſtalled by the people; ſo that it does ſufficiently
prove what we were ſaying. For when a people has brought a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
to a Throne of Juſtice, and accordingly put a ſword of Juſtice
in his hand; if he from the wicked purpoſe of his heart shall imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
leave and forſake that Throne of Juſtice, and go to a Throne
of iniquity; whereby he shall fraime and eſtablish miſchief by a Law,
and change that ſword of Juſtice into a ſword of injuſtice, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
that very intereſt, which he should have maintained; and
become a murtherer of thoſe, whome he should have defended, there
is nothing more clear and certain then that he is no longer a Juſt and
lawfull Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>Now this is to be known ſeverall ways; one way is this, that ſo
ſoon as he has received that Juſt and lawfull power from the people,
and findes himſelf well fixed therein, if he shall immediatly declare
his fals teracherous, and ſiniſtruous end in receiving that power, and
that he was only diſſembleing with the people in all his vowes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements,
that were upon him, to them, and accordingly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
renounce thoſe very vowes and ingagements that were upon
him to the people, and declare himſelf an enemy to that very intereſt
and people, which he should have preſerved and defended; then it is
moſt clear and certain that he is no Juſt and lawfull Magiſtrate. The
next way is this, that though he should not do it in ſuch a formall way,
yet he may do it practically, as many have done, who did not finde it
their intereſt in a formall way to renounce their vowes and ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but upon the contrary have indeavoured what they could to
blinde the eyes of the people, by all fair promiſes whatſomever, and
yet nothing has bin more clear and certain, then that their practice
has bin quite contrary; and that the people have found to their ſad
experience many a time; as thoſe two Queen <hi>Maryes</hi> of Scotland and
England, both of them at that very inſtant of time, vvhen they vvere
deſtroying the Proteſtant intereſt, and murthering true Proteſtants
vvere not vvanting by all fair means to perſvvade the people of their
reſolute and unchangeable purpoſe to maintain the ſame. I knovv
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:36588:8"/>
ſome vvill object, and ſay that though a Magiſtrate be found quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
for the office, as to all outvvard appearance and have the povver
lavvfully convoyed to them, yet the people are ſtill uncertain, vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be their lavvfull Magiſtrate, or not; and ſo are not obliedged to
maintain and defend him as their Juſt and lavvfull Magiſtrate, or give
him any obedience, as ſuch. To vvhich I anſvver, that vvhen a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
do diligently inquire into the qualifications of a Magiſtrate, and
as to all outvvard evidences, they are aſſured and convinced of his
ſuitable qualifications for the office; and accordingly do convoy unto
him the Juſt and lavvfull povver belonging to the office; though his
heart be fals and treacherous, yet he is to them a Juſt and lavvfull
Magiſtrate, ſo long as he doth not diſcover any thing to the contrary.
Neither is every act of vvickedneſs in a Magiſtrate, that vvhich doth
really unmagiſtrate him; though I hope non vvill deny a Magiſtrate
ought to be as circumſpeck as any other: for certainly he, vvho is to
punish vice and vvickedneſs, should not be a bad example to others.
I knovv ſome do alleadge that a King is above the Lavv, and may do
vvhat he pleaſeth: but non vvill ſay ſo, but Court-flatterers; and non
vvill pretend to ſuch a povver, but tyrants and oppreſſours: for a
perſon, vvho pretends to be above the Lavv of a Nation, does there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
exclude himſelf from the ſociety: that being nothing elſe but a
conſociation of many perſons of vvhat ranks ſomever under common
Lavv, and ſo is incapable of any office in that Nation: but vvhen a
Magiſtrate does either formally, or practically break his Faith to the
people by proveing fals and treacherous, and does thvvart and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
the very end, for vvhich he vvas ordained, and becomes a
deſtroyer and murtherer of that very intereſt and people, vvhich he
should have preſerved and defended, he does then ſufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
himſelf to be no lavvfull Magiſtrate, but a tyrant and an oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour.
Some do object, I knovv, and ſay that a Juſt and lavvfull
povver being once convoy'd unto a Magiſtrate by the people, even
though he should malverſe never ſo much, and act never ſo vvickedly
in the povver, yet ſtill he does remain a Juſt and lavvfull Magiſtrate,
untill that povver, vvhich gave him the povver, do in the ſame
manner take the povver from him. Though vvhat I have ſaid already
does ſufficiently diſcover the vveakneſs of this argument, yet I shall
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:36588:8"/>
give a particular anſvver thereto. As it is only in the people to give a
morall, externall povver, ſo as to render him a lavvfull Magiſtrate,
upon ſuppoſition of his juſtice and other neceſſary qualifications,
vvhich are gifts of God; and that it does ſtill remain that God give
him that internall and effectuall povver, vvhereby he does become
really and in effect a Juſt Magiſtrate, as in that forecited place of
<hi>Proverh. 8. ver.</hi> 15, 16. ſo the not formally takeing avvay this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
externall povver, does not at all continue him a Juſt and lavv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Magiſtrate: for vvhen a murtherer committes a murther and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervvards
is brought before a Judge, and ſentenced to die for the ſame;
it is not the ſentence of the Judge that does really, materially, and in
effect make him a murtherer, but only formally and declaratively,
and accordingly punishes him for the ſame; but it is his committing
of murther, that does really, materially and in effect make him a
murtherer. For though he should never be brought before a Judge,
or receive the ſentence of death, yet from his very committing the
act of murther he is really, materially and in effect a murtherer. So
that it is very ſtrange that ſome are pleaſed to ſay, that a Magiſtrate
haveing once the povver convoyed unto him by the people though he
should act never ſo vvickedly, yet the povver does ſtill remain the
ſame, ſo long as he is not formally diveſted; and that theſe acts of
vvickedneſs are only the bad exerciſe of that lavvfull povver, vvhich
vvas given him of the people; vvhereas Gods vvithlolding the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of juſtice, and other qualifications ſuppoſed, the povver
granted upon the ſuppoſition falles <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> vvithout any declarative
ſentence; and the people have a right vvhenever an opportunity oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curres
to reject ſuch a Magiſtrate. And it is, as impoſſible that a Juſt and
lavvfull Magiſtrate, by vertue of a Juſt and lavvfull povver, can bring
forth acts of vvickedneſs, as it is impoſſible for a good tree, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of it's goodneſs, to bring forth bad fruite. For the exerciſe of the
povver is, as the fruite from the tree; ſo that if the exerciſe of the
povver be vvicked and unjuſt, there is nothing more certain, then
that the povver it ſelf muſt be vvicked and unjuſt; and that, vvhich
once vvas a Juſt and lavvfull povver, muſt be changed into an unjuſt
and unlavvfull povver. For as a tree is knovvn by it's fruites, ſo is the
povver knovvn to be Juſt by the good acts thereof. And vvhen our
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:36588:9"/>
bleſſed Lord and Saviour vvas charged by the Phariſees of poſſeſſing
a vvicked and bad povver in caſting out of Divells by the povver of
Beelzebub the Prince of the Divells, he gives no other reaſon for a
certain proofe of the goodneſs of that povver, by vvhich he acted,
then theſe very good acts thereof, as <hi>Matth. 12. ver.</hi> 24, 25, 26, 27,
28. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> vvhen he does commend obedience to higher
povvers, as thoſe povvers, vvhich are ordained of God, vvarning
them not to reſiſt the ordinance of God, he does not leave people in
the vvilderneſs, but gives this as the certain and true Character of
Juſt and lavvfull Magiſtrates, that they vvere not a terrour to good
vvorks, but to the evill, and that they vvere the Miniſters of God to
the people for good, <hi>Rom. 13. ver.</hi> 3, 4. And accordingly the Apoſtle
<hi>Peter,</hi> in his 1 <hi>Epiſt. 2. ver.</hi> 14. gives the ſame Character, that
they are for the punishment of evill doers, and for the praiſe of them
that do vvell. So that this is the very Character by vvhich Juſt and
lavvfull Magiſtrates are knovvn to be ſuch; I knovv ſome vvill object
and ſay, that the Apoſtles gave command to obey theſe very Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
vvho vvere then in place; and they vvere the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
for they vvere not a terrour to the evill vvorks, but to the
good, But I hope non, vvho are in any meaſure acted by reaſon and
Religion vvill ever alleadge, that the Apoſtles did thvvart and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
themſelves, or that they vvere lying and diſſembling to the
people: but that this vvas given as a ſtanding command for all times
to come; that the people should give obedience to thoſe Magiſtrates,
vvho should act by vertue of Gods ordinance, and therefore gives
them the certain and true Character, by vvhich they shall knovv
ſuch Magiſtrates, ſo that the Apoſtles doctrine, doth not atall clash
vvith the neceſſity of obeying God rather then man. But I knovv
ſome do alleadge that <hi>Paul</hi> gave obedience to thoſe very Magiſtrates,
and did appeal unto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> vvho vvas a vvicked tyrant, and thereby
did acknovvledge them to be Juſt and lavvfull Magiſtrates. To all
vvhich I anſvver, that neither the Apoſtle by his practice conſonant
to his precept, doth acknovvledge <hi>Caeſars</hi> being a Juſt, or lavvfull
Magiſtrate; nor yet doth his precept, vvhich is certainly perpetuall,
extend beyond the caſe and ſtate of the people he vvrote to; to vvit
the called to be Sanctes, vvho vvere in Rome, <hi>Rom. 1. ver.</hi> 7. no
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:36588:9"/>
great number not to the whole body of the Roman people: then it is
concerning a power eſtablished, though not lawfully, or by conſent
of the people; yet by the ordinance of God, for his own wiſe endes,
which doth neither communicate juſtneſs, nor lawfullneſs to that
power, but ſingle poſſeſſion. For though God in his Juſtice ſets up
a tyrant, who has no pretence of right, for a peoples punishment,
and that tyrantes poſſeſſion of power is an ordinance of God for a
time; yet the invader is neither Juſt, nor lawfull Magiſtrate, as it's
like non will deney: but ſuch as he is, Magiſtrate in poſſeſſion, the
debelled and ſubdued by him, (according to the Apoſtles practice and
doctrine), are free to plead before his Courtes, and obliedged to
ſubmit to their civill ſentences, not only for wrath (which is a good
reaſon of prudence here allowed, they not being in a condition to
remove his yoke from them) but alſo for conſcience ſake, diſcerning
clearly, that God has ordained that power to be over them, or them
to be under that power, untill he ſend an opportunity of outgate and
deliverance, which, non can deney, they are obliedged to lay hold on
whenever it preſentes. But that the Apoſtles doctrine commanding
ſubjection to that ordinance of power, and his practice of appealing to
<hi>Caeſar</hi> may be the better underſtood, it's fit to conſider what he writes
to the Corinthians 1 <hi>Epiſt. 6. ver. 1. Dare any of you, haveing a matter
againſt another, go to Law before the unjuſt, and not before the Sanctes?</hi>
He rebooks them in the 7. <hi>vers. Now therefore this is utterly a fault
amongſt you becauſe ye go to Law one with another; why do you not rather
take wrong? why do you not rather ſuffer your ſelves to be defrauded?
There is utterly a fault in you that you have pleaes amongſt your ſelves, each
of you should deal juſtly with all men of choice, voluntarly, and without
need of being compelled.</hi> Nay (<hi>ver. 8.) you do wrong, and defraud, and
that even your bretheren.</hi> Here is the higheſt degree of the fault: but
to the perſons wronged he ſayes <hi>vers 7. why do you not rather ſuffer
your ſelves to be defrauded? then have a plea with your bretheren?</hi> before
what ever Judge it be (as the text moſt clearly importes) non muſt
thinke, that there is here a command not to implead a brother, as is
clear by the 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, <hi>ver. Do ye not know that the Sanctes shall
judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthie
to judge the ſmalleſt matters? 3. Know ye not that we shall judge Angels,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:36588:10"/>
hou much more things that pertaine to this life? 4. If then ye have Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of things pertaineing to this life, ſet them to judge who are leaſt
eſteemed in the Church. 5. I ſpeake to your shame. Is it ſo, that there is
not a wiſe man amongſt you? No not one, that shall be able to judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his bretheren.</hi> Nor yet is it commanded as a poſitive duty to
ſuffer defraud from a brother, much leſs in ſuch a meaſure as is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant
with what the Apoſtle writes <hi>Rom. 12. ver. 17. Recompence to
no man evill for evill. Provide things honeſt in the ſight of all men. 2 Corint.
chap. 8, ver. 21. Provide for honeſt things, not only in the ſight of the
Lord. but in the ſight of men. 1 Timoth. 5. ver. 8. But if any provide
not for his own, eſpecially for thoſe of his own houſe, he hath deny'd the
faith and is worſe then an infidele.</hi> But this queſtion, why &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 7.
importes an advice in reference to a tollerable loſs, to an eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Charity towards the bretheren in matters of <hi>meum &amp; tuum,</hi>
and is of the ſame nature with theſe propoſed 1 <hi>Corinth. 7. ver. 38, 40.
So then he that giveth her in mariage, doth well: but he that giveth her not
in mariage, doth better. 40. But she is happier if she ſo abide, after my
judgement, and I thinke alſo that I have the Spirit of God.</hi> Then the
queſtion proceeds thus, if one keep back from another what of right
he should have, and the other is not able, or yet has not that meaſure
of Charity to bear the loſſe; or if there be doubtfull queſtions of Law
amongſt you, why do you not chuſe by conſent a wiſe man of the
beſt eſteemed in the Church to judge between his bretheren, to whoſe
determination you should ſtand; and not leave your ſelves under a
neceſſity (as that is of ones being wrong'd and defrauded of all his
meanes) of impleading the bretheren before infideles. Note by the
way, that the whole argument runs upon matters commonly called
civill; not criminall, as Murther, Robbery, Adultery &amp;c. Upon
which they were not then in caſe to appoint Judges, or indued in any
caſe to coact, or compell: the next ſtep he makes is upon the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
that they have of their bretheren perſons condeſcended upon
to determine their differences <hi>ver. 1. Dare any of you</hi> &amp;c: <hi>implead or
purſue before the unjuſt and not before the Sanctes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the whole theſe things will be clear to a diſcerning perſon,
Firſt, that in criminalles, upon which they could have no Authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Judges of their own; and in civills, in caſe by common fault
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:36588:10"/>
they had non appointed of their own, and alſo in caſe the injuring
party would not ſtand to the Sentence given (they haveing no power
to compell him) they might lawfully purſue before the power in being,
though infidele: albeit in the laſt two caſes it were more Charitable
to bear a comportable loſs; and in all caſes, though the loſs be not
borne the injury muſt be forgiven, and vengeance laid aſide ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Matth. 6. ver. 14, 15. For if ye forgive men their treſpaſſes,
yeur heavenly father will alſo forgive you. ver. 15. But if ye forgive not
men their treſpaſſes neither will your heavenly father forgive your treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, That the party defendor in a juſt defence may plead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any Judge he is called to, and appeal from an inferior to a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior,
if expedient for his ſafety, or cauſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the juſt Sentences of ſuch Judges are to be obeyed
for conſcience ſake; and the unjuſt may be yielded to (in civill caſes
eſpecially) if there be no shunning it, for wrathes ſake; and in ſuch
things, one may ſtill chuſe the greater conveniency, provided it be
done <hi>ſalva innocentiâ:</hi> as he who by an unjuſt ſentence is appointed
to pay 100 Crownes at a certain day, or 200, if he paſs it, may
juſtly and innocently ſave 100 by preventing that ſet day.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That what is done in any of theſe caſes, doth no way
acknowledge an uſurped power it's juſtneſs, or it's lawfulneſs, but
only, (which can not be denyed) it's exiſtance, And moreover it is
not perſecuting Religion ſimply, as it is Religion, that unmagiſtrates
a Magiſtrate, and thereby makes him become a Tyrant, but it is the
perſecuting of Religion as it is the right and priviledge of a Nation.
For thoſe Magiſtrates, who did then perſecute Religion, were not
at all guilty of the breach of Faith and truſt to the people; becauſe they
were not under any ingagement to the people to defend the ſame; in
reſpect of Religions not being the right and priviledge of thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
therefore the perſecuting Religion did not in the leaſt unma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
them: but it is a far different thing where Religion is become
the right and priviledge of the Nation; and the Magiſtrate formally
ingaged to maintain and defend the ſame; Then perſecuting Religion
is a formall breach of his Faith and truſt to the people, and a robbing
them of the beſt and choiceſt priviledges that they have, upon which
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:36588:11"/>
all their other priviledges have a dependency. For there are ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
that a people can diſpence with the want of: but this is ſuch a
priviledge, that the want thereof can not be diſpenced with. For if
they should diſpence with the want of Religion, then they should
diſpence with the want of God alſo; for by their forſakeing of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
they forſake God alſo. I know ſome will object, aud ſay, that
the Magiſtrates may change their own Religion and yet not take from
the people theirs, and ſo not be guilty of the breach of Faith and
truſt to the people. To which I anſwer, that the Magiſtrates chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geing
from the Religion eſtablished forfeits, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> his right of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy:
and when the Religion is condeſcended upon by the people,
and the Magiſtrate formally ingaged to maintain and defend the ſame;
his very changeing therefrom is a breach of his Faith and truſt to the
people, and thereby he becomes a Traytour to God and his native
Country. But it's like ſome may alleadge, that a Magiſtrate may
give a tolleration of Religion, and thereby tollerat a falſe Religion.
To which I anſwer, that if the Conſtitution of the Government does
allow of the ſame, and it be done by the conſent of the people, or
their repreſentatives, the Magiſtrate is the more excuſable: but if it
be done contrary to the expres Laws of the Land, and without the
conſent of the people or their repreſentatives, the Magiſtrate in this
caſe is no leſs then a thiefe and a robber; and as there is a curſe due to
ſuch as do remove the Landmarkes, and that as to the civill and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Intereſt of men amongſt themſelves, <hi>Deutr. 19. ver.</hi> 14. and
27. <hi>ver. 17. Proverb. 22. ver.</hi> 28. certainly there muſt be a great
curſe due to ſuch as do remove the Landmarkes of the Land, upon
which the good, peace and ſafety, yea and glory of the Land does
depend. And as <hi>David</hi> underſtood it well to be his duty to pray that
<hi>God would confound all ſuch as did worship graven Images, Pſal. 97. ver.</hi> 7.
Certainly it is the duty of the people of God to pray that God would
confound ſuch as do, not only worship graven Images, but eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
the ſame in a Land, where the Glory of God has shined brightly
in his pure Ordinances; and that contrary to the Laws of the Land
and conſent of the people. And as there is a command by the Lord to
ſtone to death ſuch as should but ſecretely intice and lead the people
away to Idolatry, <hi>Deutr. 13. ver.</hi> 6. and 17, <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:36588:11"/>
certainly this command muſt in a great meaſure reach him, who
does the ſame in ſuch a publick manner. But I know ſome will yet
alleadge that NERO was not only a perſecutor of Religion, but he
was otherwayes a perſecutor and deſtroyer of his people, and was really
a Tyrant, and an oppreſſour. That he was once this, I do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
but that he was ſuch at that time, I will not ſo eaſily grant,
in reſpect of the good intertainement <hi>Paul</hi> had from him. And thoſe
very Hiſtorians, who do ſay that NERO became a Tyrant, do alſo
ſay that it was not in the firſt five years of his Reign, but that for the
firſt five years he Reigned as a Sanct, ſo that the people ſaid, that a
God was come down from Heaven to govern them. But grant he had
bin a Tyrant, it was not <hi>Paules</hi> intereſt to call it in queſtion being
only a ſtranger, and what he did might have bin done by him, though
he had fallen unto the hands of thieves and murtherers by the way.
For if a man should fall unto the hands of thieves and murtherers by
the way, and if they were going to take away his life, if he knew any
of them to have a greater power then another, and to have ſome title
of honour above others, it were no ſin in him to make application to
him in the ſame manner, by giveing thoſe titles of honour that were
any ways common and ordinar to him, that thereby his generoſity
might be ingaged to show him mercy. There are ſome, I know, will
ſtill object, that the Kings of Iſrael, though moſt wicked, and in
effect Tyrants and oppreſſours, as <hi>Saul, Zedekiah</hi> and others, yet
they did ſtill remain Juſt and lawfull Magiſtrates untill the day of their
death, and the people gave obedience to them as ſuch; as alſo when
the people of Iſrael were ſubdued by <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> though in
effect a wicked Tyrant and oppreſſour, yet the people are then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
to give obedience to him, as their Magiſtrate in all things law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
From what has bin ſayd already it does clearly appear, that when
once a Magiſtrate does degenerate unto a Tyrant, he can no more be
accompted a Juſt and lawfull Magiſtrate, then that man, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittes
all manner of Villany, and knavery can be ſayd to be an honeſt
man from what he has bin formerly. And as for <hi>Saul,</hi> we finde that
no ſooner he had committed Rebellion againſt God, but as ſoon the
Prophete <hi>Samuel</hi> is ſent to tell him, that the Kingdome was rent out
of his hand; and accordingly <hi>David</hi> was anointed King in his place:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:36588:12"/>
and in reſpect that the people did not performe their part in a formall
diveſting him of the power and eſtablishing of <hi>David,</hi> they were
made ſufficiently to ſmarte for it: for he killed fourſcore of the Prieſts
of the Lord: and when foreſaken of the Lord, went to the Divell
for councill, and when invaded by the enemy he and they both were
deſtroyed, and the curſe of God did lye heavily upon the Kingdome
for his ſake, ſo that much blood was shed, till that <hi>David</hi> was put
in full poſſeſſion of that, which was his Juſt and proper right. And
although <hi>Davids</hi> heart did ſmite him, ſo that he could not kill him in
the cave, from theſe reaſons following. Firſt, That God honour'd
him, makeing him King; and that he was not as yet formally diveſted
of the power. Secondly, That he was his Father in Law. Thirdly,
He vvas a brave man, as appeares from that commendation <hi>David</hi>
gives him after his death, that his bovv did never return empty;
Fourthly, The braveneſs of <hi>Davids</hi> ſpirit; yet <hi>David</hi> vvanted not a
purpoſe to have done it in Battel, as vve may finde from theſe vvords,
ſome one day or other he shall fall in Battel. And it could be for no
other end, that <hi>David</hi> did keep ſo many in armes vvith him; for if he
had looked upon him to have bin the Juſt and lavvfull Magiſtrate, it
had bin uſurpation and Rebellion in him to have accepted of that right,
vvhich the Prophete had given him. And as for <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> he did not
ſo formally breake to the people, as he and they vvent alongſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in Apoſtacy and defection from God, as is clear from that
Scripture, <hi>Jerem. 38. ver.</hi> 5, 24, 25. vvhen the Princes beſought that
<hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s life might be taken. <hi>Then Zedekiah the King ſayd, behold,
he is in your hand; for the King is not he, that can do any thing againſt
you;</hi> and yet vve finde, that the Lord declared him to have no right
to Reign, as in that Scripture, <hi>Ezek. 21. ver. 25, 26, 27. And thou
profane, wicked Prince of Iſrael, whoſe day is come, when iniquity shall
have an end, 26. Thus ſayeth the Lord God, remove the Diademe, and
take off the Crown, this shall not be the ſame, exalt him that is low, and
abaſe him that is high. 2. I will overturn, overturn, overturn, and it
shall be no more, till he come whoſe right it is, and I will give it him.</hi>
As alſo vvhen they vvere delivered into the hands of <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi>
they vvere commanded to renounce all alleadgeance in <hi>Zedekiah,</hi>
and to take protection from <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> as priſoners of War,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:36588:12"/>
and ſo ſubmit to him in all things lavvfull, as their Magiſtrate, for a
time; untill God should deliver them out of his hand.</p>
            <p>Haveing novv in ſome meaſure held forth and diſcovered vvhat it
is that makes a Juſt and lavvfull Magiſtrate, and continues him ſuch
and thereby diſcovered, vvhat it is that makes a Tyrant; It remains
novv to be ſpoken to, vvhether a people are obliedged to ſvveare and
keep alleadgeance, and do the ſame duty to a Tyrant; that they are
to a Juſt and lavvfull Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>That it is the duty of a people to ſvveare, and keep alleadgeance to
a Juſt and lavvfull Magiſtrate, is not in the leaſt to be queſtioned;
for thereby a Magiſtrate is in a capacity to do the duty of a Juſt and
lavvfull Magiſtrate to his people, and vvithout it he is not: but to
ſvveare Alleadgeance to a Tyrant, is moſt vvicked and ſinfull. For
Juſt and lavvfull Magiſtrates are ordinances of God, for his Glory
and the good of the people, as the true and reall Miniſters of God,
for the peoples good, but Tyrants and oppreſſours are only raiſed up
by the Lord, for Judgements and plagues to a people, for their
diſobedience to God. For God never gave a right to Tyrants and
oppreſſours to govern his people, but ordained them for a peoples
punishment, according to that povver, that the Divell has; for he
has a povver, both to tempt to ſin, and alſo the punish for ſin; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
God has him allvvayes reſtrained as to both; ſuch is the povver
of Tyrants and oppreſſours; for as they are plagues and Judgements
againſt theſe parts of the vvorld, vvhere they have povver, by rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
them of their rights and priviledges, ſo are they alſo by tempting
people to ſin againſt God; to vvhich aſſertion the Chriſtian vvorld
this day may give their vvitneſs; as in Brittain, Ireland, France, and
other parts of the vvorld, not only have they bin robbed of their
rights and priviledges, but all manner of vvays uſed to make them ſin
againſt God. And as it is a great and Rebellious ſin againſt God to
enter in any Compact, or Covenant vvith the Divell, to mantain
and keep up him in his vvicked povver, ſo it is the very ſame, to
enter in any Compact or Covenant vvith Tyrants, and oppreſſours
to mantain and keep them up, in their vvicked povver; for thereby
Satans Kingdome is mantained and kept up; vvhich I prove thus,
ſuch as do ſvveare to mantain and keep up thoſe, vvho do mantain
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:36588:13"/>
and keep up Satans Kingdome; do ſvveare to mantain and keep up
Satans Kingdome; but ſuch as do ſvveare to mantain and keep up
Tyrants and oppreſſours, do ſvveare to mantain and keep up thoſe,
vvho do mantain and keep up Satans Kingdome, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they do
ſvveare to mantain and keep up Satans Kingdome; for as Hell and
Divells are immediately oppoſite, and contradictory to Heaven and
thoſe holy Spirits, vvhich are there; ſo Tyranny and oppreſſion;
Tyrants, and oppreſſours are the ſame oppoſite and contradictory to
the true ordinance and Miniſters of God here on earth, and it does
moſt natively follovv, that vvhatever vvickedneſs they do commit, or
innocent blood they shed; their concurrance is not vvanting thereto;
and that they are guilty thereof; vvhich I prove thus, ſuch as do
mantain and keep up a Tyrant and an oppreſſour in a vvicked and
tyrannicall povver, are guilty of all his vvickedneſſes, Tyranny,
and bloodshed, but ſuch as do ſvveare Alleadgeance to a Tyrant, and
an oppreſſour, are thereby obliedged to mantain and keep him up in
that vvicked and tyrannicall povver, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are guilty of all his
vvickedneſs, Tyranny and bloodshed; yea if it vvere in their povver
by a good vvish, or prayer to God, or other indeavour to do good
to the intereſt of God, thy can not give it, or do it; for ſo long as
they ſtand under that Alleadgeance in the doing of any of theſe
things they commit perjury. I knovv ſome do object, and ſay that
vvicked Magiſtrates, yea Tyrants and oppreſſours are raiſed up by the
Lord as plagues and Judgements againſt a people for their ſines, and
therefore they are obliedged patiently to bear the ſame from Gods
hand, vvithout uſeing any reſiſtance vvhatſomever; and accordingly
to pray to God for thoſe Tyrants, that the Government may be bleſſed
to them. That they are raiſed up by the Lord as plagues and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
againſt a people for their ſins, as alſo that a people are oblied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
patiently to endure, and bear the ſame tovvards God, no vvays
freteing at the diſpenſation of God therein, knovving it be the Juſt,
and reall effects and fruits of ſin; as alſo to pray for them, is not in
the leaſt to be queſtioned: but that a people should ſtupidly lye under
the ſame, vvithout uſeing any indeavour to remove the ſame, is a
moſt vvicked deluſion: for certainly all people vvhatſomever are
obliedged to uſe all means and indeavours vvhatſomever Religious and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:36588:13"/>
morall to the removeing of plagues and Judgements from a Land,
if it were even by prayers, teares and faſtings; yea <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>e and ſword.
For as it is ſin that brings them on, ſo it is ſin that keeps them on;
and as it is a peoples duty moſt circumſpectly, and with all diligence to
gard againſt thoſe ſins, that may bring on plagues and Judgements, ſo
it is their duty to put away thoſe ſins, that does continue them, and
uſe all indeavours to remove the ſame; otherwayes they will be found
guilty of as great Rebellion againſt God by doing that, which keeps
them on, as by doing that which brought them on, though it were
no more but even in the very remiſneſs of their duty. If any perſon
through the exceſs of Drunkeneſs should have ſo waſted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
his body, that nothing but death in a very short time were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
and if an Eminent Phyſician should adviſe him to a more
temperate and moderate life as the only certaine mean, whereby to
recover his health and ſtrength and to continue his dayes longer in
the world; if he should anſwere, that as by the exceſs of Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
he had brought on that punishment upon himſelf, and being
convinced of it's being the native and proper effects of his ſin, ſo he
would indure the ſame patiently without uſeing any mean or indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to remove the ſame, and would ſtill go on in his Drunkeneſs
praying to God to bleſs that unto him and make the ſame effectuall
for his health and ſtrength, would he not be accompted by all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
and good men a fool and a mad man, and a deſtroyer
of both ſoul and body. Now when a people through their madneſs
and folly have inlarged the power of Kings beyond thoſe due limites,
that the Word of God, and reaſon, yea and the Lawes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
have ſet thereto, or if they by force and treachery have done
the ſame, ſo that both God and the people are robbed of their right,
and they become Tyrants and oppreſſours; if they should not only be
remiſs as to all indeavours whatſomever, whereby to extricate and
deliver themſelves from thoſe plagues and Judgements, but go on in
that very courſe of ſinning againſt God, by which they did bring
them on, praying to God for the long Reign and proſperity of thoſe
Tyrants and oppreſſours, and that the Government might be bleſſed
unto them, could they be accompted any thing elſe then fools, and
mad men; rebelles and enemies to God and his Ordinance, yea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayers
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:36588:14"/>
and deſtroyers of their own rights, liberties, peace, good
and proſperity in the world; for if there were a Company of Thieves
and Murtherers, who by their cunning and force were moſt dexterous,
and active in robbing, and murthering upon all occaſions, and if
the people should pray only to convince them of their ſin and reclame
them from the ſame without haveing the leaſtdeſire to God, that
they might be apprehended, and Juſtice execute upon them, that
ſo God might be Glorifyed, and thoſe plagues and Judgements
removed from a Land; certainely theſe would be but very lame pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers:
but if theſe thieves and murtherers upon ſome great deſigne
of their own, and for the advancement of their own intereſt, should
for a time shew great mercy and favour, and if the people then should
pray that they might live long and proſper, and that, that domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nireing
and tyrannicall power of theirs might be bleſſed to them, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
this would be great Rebellion againſt God, their own rights
and liberties: and there is nothing more certain then, that Tyrants
and oppreſſours are the greateſt Thieves and Murtherers in the world;
for where common and ordinary Thieves do rob and murther their
tens, or twentyes, they do rob and murther their thouſands, and
millions; for whole Kingdoms and Nations do thus ſuffer by them,
and though it be lawfull, and duty to pray, that God would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
and reclame ſuch, and that with mercy to their Souls, yet this
muſt never be wanting, that God would bring down thoſe Thrones
of iniquity, and cauſe Juſtice overtake thoſe Tyrants and oppreſſours,
that God may be glorifyed and the Land delivered from ſuch plagues,
and Judgements: and as it is the duty of every true Chriſtian, ſo often
as he minds the intereſt of his own Soul, not to forget the intereſt of
God, but to pray that Gods Kingdome may come, and his will be
done in Earth as it is in Heaven; and that all ſtopes and letes may be
taken out of the way of his Kingdome and Glory; and in a ſpeciall
manner Tyrants and oppreſſours, thoſe ſtoopes and pillars of that
Antichriſtian and Satanicall Kingdome in the world may be brought
down, and levelled with the duſt; ſo it is the abſolute duty of all
Chriſtians, to do it with hearts fully purpoſed and determined to
ſerve God in this very matter, and to this very end; and to pray
that God would give them occaſion thus to Evidence their love, zeal,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:36588:14"/>
and faithfullneſs for him; that ſo they may not be reckoned amongſt
thoſe curſed and uſeleſs creatures for God in their generation, and
ſuch, whoſe hearts are not thus determined will be ſo far from being
found to anſwere the deſign and end of the ſecond Article of our
Lords Prayer, that they will be found but mockeres and diſſemblers
of God. Now that all true Chriſtians may thus pray and do, is the
earneſt deſire of him, who deſires and hopes to be and continue a true
lover of God, his intereſt, and all ſuch as are the true lovers thereof
in the world.</p>
