            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A SVVEET PROSOPOPEIA OF THE SPEECH OF KING CLODOVEUS, TO THE BISHOPS AND THEIR OPPOSERS, AFTER HE VVAS CONVERTED AND BAPTIZED.</head>
            <p>MY Lords; (for ſo you ſtile your ſelves) you remember what promiſe you cauſed mee to make unto you, before you would Baptize me. Now I declare unto you that it is ſince manifeſted unto me; that thoſe vowes which you then cauſed me to promiſe, to defend with all my force, are litigious. For your tenets you hould them one way, and your oppoſers an other, yet neither you nor they utterly deny them; both you, and they confeſſe them, but heerein you differ. You affirme that forme wherein you ſtand, that faith, that Church to be the very ſame; which was received of the Apoſtles; well thus you pleade, and I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that howſoever the ſucceſſion of Biſhops have held it, and whereſoever it hath beene diſperſed, yet this I now doe underſtand; that the receipt of the Apoſtles from Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe is the firſt principle, and ground of my vow, which I promiſed to perſiſt in, and to defend with all my force, and all the other Circumſtances of my promiſe are but depending upon this. Know therefore this, that this I chiefely aime to keepe; and ſo farre to aſſiſt you, as you ground upon this. But on the contrary, your oppoſers doe averre, and on their part maintaine; proteſting to affirme, and prove that your faith and Church is not that faith, and Church, which the Apoſtles received and delivered, but is utterly degenerate, and ſwarved from it. Looke ye therefore to it; bee not yee your ſelves the cauſe to make me breake that promiſe, which you made me vow. You ſee that theſe oppoſe you, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe you juſtifie your ſelves how you can, of what they object againſt you, to cleare your one cauſe as you can, to confute them. And you the Biſhops adverſaries, on your part, my deſire is, that you on the other ſide, ſhould lay downe your proofes, (the beſt you can) to defend the faith and Church, which you maintaine; and if your reaſons bee better grounded then theirs, I ſhall defend you; otherwiſe I ſhall impugne your forme, and defend theirs againſt you.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe the proceeding therein ſhall be juſt, and equall, both towards the plaintife, and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, neither you, nor your adverſaries ſhall have any voice on either part to judge; neither in your teſtimony northeirs, for thus to doe to one werepartiality, to the other injuſtice. And to avoide all ſuſpicion, I my ſelfe (whom the matter both for my office, and glory more concerneth) In regard of my vow, which makes me a party in the cauſe, will therefore be no Judge, but an indifferent hearer of you both.</p>
            <p>Me thinkes it ſhould be no difficult matter to cleare this controverſie, becauſe you both admit the Scriptures to be the word of God; and the Apoſtles faith, and the Apoſtles Church be ſo manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recorded in the Scriptures; and Chriſt himſelfe willeth us to ſearch the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Know ye therefore, that without partiality your faiths and Churches on either part ſhall bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to, and levelled, by that platforme which ſhall be found there apparently expreſſed.</p>
            <p>Therefore expect no other tryall; but that as the Scripture ſhall ſtrike the ſtroke betweene you, even ſo will I be led to miniſter juſtice, and maintaine my vow; and will (with all my force) defend that faith, and Church; vvhich ſhall there be found to be received from the Apoſtles, and vvill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate (vvith all my force) that faith and Church; vvhich is degenerate from it.</p>
