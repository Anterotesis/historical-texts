            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am deliver'd from all other Care
then of my <hi>Duty</hi> and my <hi>Honour;</hi>
and This <hi>Tranquillity</hi> of <hi>Thought,</hi>
I am to thank the <hi>Malice</hi> of my
<hi>Fortune</hi> for; which has left me
neither <hi>worse</hi> to <hi>Fear,</hi> nor much
<hi>better</hi> to <hi>hope</hi> for.</p>
            <p>In This Estate of <hi>Freedome</hi> and <hi>Security,</hi> I must
presume to Dedicate this Paper to your Lordship:
which is no more then a fair offer of a <hi>supposed Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal</hi>
to a <hi>Publique Tryal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be pleas'd to know (my Lord) that upon</hi> Friday
<hi>Morning last, in</hi> Westminster-Hall, <hi>a Gentleman
took me aside:</hi> L'Estrange <hi>(sayes he)</hi> I am glad to
meet you: for I'm unquiet till I have told you something,
which both in <hi>Honour,</hi> and in <hi>Conscience,</hi> I think
my self oblig'd to acquaint you with. <hi>Continuing
Thus,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am the Person that gave <hi>Intelligence</hi> to my <hi>Lord
Chancellour,</hi> that <hi>You betray'd the King's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs;</hi>
but with such <hi>Caution,</hi> and <hi>Deliberation</hi> as
you your self in my place would have done no lesse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:110083:3"/>
My Lord; he told me the whole matter, with so
<hi>obliging</hi> and so <hi>Frank</hi> a <hi>Cleerness,</hi> that truly when I
weigh <hi>one</hi> Office against the <hi>other;</hi> (that is, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their true Intention) his <hi>Iustice</hi> and his
<hi>Kindness here,</hi> compar'd with his <hi>former mistake,</hi> I
reckon that I have an <hi>Obligation</hi> to him.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman was further pleas'd to give me a
view of your Lordships <hi>Answer</hi> to him; which I
confess, was <hi>Charitable,</hi> considering the <hi>Suggestion,</hi>
but as related to my <hi>Innocence,</hi> 'twas <hi>sharp</hi> and <hi>Cruell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not wonder now (my Lord) at some Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
I have heard of late; as if your <hi>Lordship</hi>
were my <hi>Enemy;</hi> (having such Reason for it) nor
at his Sacred <hi>Majesties Displeasure,</hi> toward a Person
under so Black a <hi>Character.</hi> To clear my self to <hi>You</hi>
my Lord, and to the <hi>World,</hi> must be the Businesse
of This Paper.</p>
            <p>Waiving the Parties mediate to this Notice; the
Ground of all is fix'd upon Mr. <hi>Iames Whitlock:</hi> a
<hi>Captain</hi> of <hi>Horse,</hi> and a <hi>Knight</hi> of <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s. <hi>He</hi>
(as this Gentleman my Friend undertakes to prove)
declar'd, that <hi>L'Estrange</hi> WAS A TRAYTOUR;
AND TO HIS KNOWLEDGE HAD RECEI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VED
<hi>six hundred Pounds In Gold, from</hi> CROM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WELL.—<hi>Hinc
Illae Lachrymae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall not passe good manners so far, as to call
This <hi>Scandal</hi> by the <hi>right Name:</hi> but This I humbly
<hi>Begg,</hi> and <hi>Offer</hi> that I may put my <hi>Life</hi> upon the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:110083:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Tryal;</hi> which I profess I had rather <hi>lose,</hi> than in the
case of <hi>Treason, Wear</hi> it as a <hi>Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further my Lord, I shall be bold to add, that
These ensuing <hi>Particulars</hi> are <hi>Truths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. I never took <hi>Protestation, Covenant, Oath,</hi> or
any <hi>Engagement</hi> of That Quality from them.</p>
            <p>2. I never <hi>Comply'd</hi> with the <hi>Party</hi> in any thing
whatsoever, related to the <hi>Publique.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. I never spake to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> save four times in
my Life. <hi>First,</hi> being his <hi>Prisoner</hi> at <hi>Chambridge.
Twice</hi> more, while I was a <hi>Prisoner</hi> in <hi>Newgate,</hi> I went
to him (under a <hi>Guard</hi>) to move for an <hi>Exchange.</hi>
The <hi>Fourth</hi> and <hi>Last</hi> time was in 1653. when being
ty'd by a <hi>Restreyning Order</hi> to attend an <hi>Examination,</hi>
and my <hi>Father</hi> lying then upon his <hi>Death-sickness,</hi>
I mov'd <hi>Cromwell</hi> that I might go down and receive
my Fathers <hi>Blessing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. I did never communicate Directly or Indirectly
<hi>(as I have said elsewhere)</hi> with any man of the Party
upon Publique Business.</p>
            <p>5. I never made a <hi>Particular Acquaintance</hi> with
any man of that <hi>Side,</hi> that had not first <hi>disown'd</hi> the
<hi>Cause,</hi> and Actually <hi>serv'd</hi> the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. I did never decline either <hi>Hazzard, Labour,</hi>
or (to my little Power) <hi>Expence,</hi> in order to his
<hi>Majesties Service:</hi> nor did I ever let slip any <hi>Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity</hi>
of doing my <hi>Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:110083:4"/>
Now (with your Leave my Lord) <hi>I challenge the
whole World to contradict me:</hi> and by your Lordships
favour yet a little further.</p>
            <p>I was engag'd in the First <hi>Scotch Expedition:</hi> after
which, when the Broyls began in <hi>England,</hi> I was
Confederate with divers Gentlemen to endevour
the Securing of <hi>Lin Regis</hi> for his Majesty. That
failing, I betook my self to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and Serv'd in
Prince <hi>Rupert</hi>'s <hi>Troup.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My next remove was to <hi>Newark</hi> (then Govern'd
hy the now-Lord <hi>Byron:</hi>) where, after a while, I
reciev'd an Invitation out of <hi>Norfolk</hi> to attempt
something upon <hi>Lin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Motives</hi> to the Enterprize were <hi>These. Walton</hi>
the <hi>Governour</hi> was before <hi>Crowland;</hi> (a place of
<hi>Consequence</hi> and <hi>Strength.</hi>) And <hi>Lin</hi> left almost with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a <hi>Guard;</hi> and a considerable number of Gallant
Gentlemen, that had been taken at <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and
<hi>Gainsborough,</hi> then <hi>Prisoners</hi> in the <hi>Town.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Occasion call'd me to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his late-Majesties <hi>Commission,</hi> to endevour
the <hi>Surprizal</hi> of the <hi>Place.</hi> It was <hi>sign'd,</hi> and <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd</hi>
to me, by the now-Earl of <hi>Bristol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was <hi>Betray'd</hi> in the Attempt by one <hi>Leman,</hi>
formerly of the <hi>Kings Party,</hi> and ty'd up by an
Oath of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Secresie,</hi> as binding as Syllables
could make it.</p>
            <p>Thence, I was carried to <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>there ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg'd
to Dye;</hi> under <hi>These Solaecismes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:110083:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>First;</hi> I condition'd for my Life when I was taken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Next;</hi> It was contrary to <hi>Articles</hi> betwixt the <hi>Earl of</hi> Manchester,
<hi>and the Governour</hi> of <hi>Newark;</hi> to which Garrison I belong'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly;</hi> The Committee by their own Law were not empowr'd to try me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly;</hi> They jugled up a Court almost at Midnight, and Sentenc'd
Me to Death without a Hearing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly;</hi> I was adjug'd to Dye by a <hi>Court-Martial</hi> as a <hi>Traytor,</hi> yet they
themselves confess'd that I never receiv'd any <hi>Trust: D.</hi> MILLS the
now Chancellor of Norwich <hi>was my</hi> Iudge-Advocate.</p>
            <p>Betwixt my Doom, and my appointed Execution,
Mr. <hi>Thorowgood,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Arrowsmith,</hi> (then of the
<hi>Synod</hi>) gave me a <hi>Visit;</hi> and very friendly tendred me
the utmost of their <hi>Interest</hi> to <hi>save</hi> me; if I would but
<hi>Petition</hi> for <hi>Mercy,</hi> and offer to take the <hi>Covenant.</hi>
These Gentlemen will acquit me (my Lord) that I
<hi>refus'd</hi> it.</p>
            <p>At length by the Interest and Kindness, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
of the Earls of <hi>Northumberland, Essex, Stamford</hi>
with others, I was <hi>Reprieved;</hi> First, for a <hi>Fortnight,</hi>
and till further <hi>Order;</hi> and then, under Colour of a
<hi>further Hearing:</hi> which in almost <hi>four</hi> years I could
not obtain, although I pressed it earnestly. With the
same Faith and Openness have I proceeded to this
Instant.</p>
            <p>Out of <hi>Newgate,</hi> I slipp'd into <hi>Kent</hi> in 1648, and
of that Action I presented your Lordship with a
Printed Accompt in <hi>Flanders:</hi> to which I dare refer
the most <hi>unsatisfy'd</hi> of my <hi>Enemies.</hi> After that <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat</hi>
I cross'd the Seas, and return'd in 1653, fixing
in <hi>London,</hi> as the most proper place, in Relation both
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:110083:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to my <hi>Publique Duty,</hi> and <hi>particular Safety.</hi> Since
which time my Lord, let my Soul answer for it, if
(according to the best of my own memory) I ever
exchang'd one Syllable with <hi>Cromwell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the <hi>Cheshire Motion,</hi> I can appeal to a <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi>
several persons in <hi>London,</hi> and to a <hi>Declaration</hi>
now Extant in my <hi>Apology,</hi> that at that time I was
not <hi>Idle.</hi> And touching those succeeding <hi>Broyles</hi>
which more immediately led to his Sacred Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's
<hi>Return.</hi> I dare remit my self to half the honest
Part of the <hi>City;</hi> who Then were of opinion that
Those <hi>Remonstrances, Protests, Resolves, Engagements,
Declarations,</hi> &amp;c. however drawn by my unlucky
hand, were no <hi>Ill office</hi> toward his <hi>Majesty:</hi> They will
at least acquit me, of <hi>Ill meaning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At last my Lord, having scap'd all these Rocks
and Storms, I meet new dangers in the <hi>Harbour:</hi> I
