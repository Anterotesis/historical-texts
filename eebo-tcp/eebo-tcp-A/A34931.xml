            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Authors friend will not usurp much upon thy Eye; this is only for those, whom the name of our Divine Poet hath not yet seised into admiration, I dare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake, that what</hi> Jamblicus (in vita Pythagorae) <hi>affirmeth of his Muster, at his Contemplations, these Poems can,</hi> viz. <hi>They shalt lift thee Reader, some yards above the ground; and, as in</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:101362:3"/>
Pythagoras <hi>School, every temper was first tuned into a height by several pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of Musick, and spiritualiz'd for one of his weighty Lectures; so, mayst thou take a Poem hence, and tune thy soul by it into a Heavenly pitch; and thus refined and born up upon the wings of Meditation, in these Poems thou maist talk freely of God, and of that other state.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here's</hi> Herbert'<hi>s second, but equal, who hath retriv'd Poetry of late, and return'd it up to its Primitive use; Let it bound back to Heaven Gates, whence it came. Think ye St</hi> Augustine <hi>would have steyned his graver Learning with a book of Poetry, had he fancied their dearest end to be the vanity of Love-Sonnets, and Epithalamiums? No, no, he thought with this our Poet, that every foot in a high-born Verse, might help to measure the soul into that better</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:101362:3"/>
               <hi>world:</hi> Divine Poetry; <hi>I dare hold it, in position against</hi> Suarez <hi>on the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to be the Language of the Angels; it is the Quintessence of Phantasie and discourse center'd in Heaven; 'tis the very outgoings of the soul; 'tis what alone our Author is able to tell you, and that in his own Verse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It were prophane but to mention here in the Preface those under-headed Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, Retainers to Seven shares and a half; Madrigal fellows, whose only bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness in Verse, is to rime a poor Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peny Soul, a Subburb sinner into Hell;—May such arrogant pretenders to Poetry vanish, with their prodigious issue of tumorous heats and flashes of their adulterate Brains, and for ever after, may this our Poet fill up the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter room of man. Oh! when the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral arraignment of Poets shall be, to give an account of their higher souls;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:101362:4"/>
               <hi>with what a triumphant brow shall our Divine Poet sit above and look down upon poor</hi> Homer, Virgil, Horace, Claudian, &amp;c. <hi>who had amongst them the ill luck to talk out a great part of their gallant</hi> Genius <hi>upon Bees, Dung, Frogs, and Gnats,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and not as himself here, upon Scriptures, Divine Graces, Martyrs and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader, we stile his Sacred Poems,</hi> Steps to the Temple, <hi>and aptly, for in the Temple of God, under his wing, he led his life in</hi> S. Maries <hi>Church near</hi> St. Peter's <hi>Colledge; there he lodged under</hi> Tertullian'<hi>s roof of Angels; there he made his Nest more gladly then</hi> David'<hi>s Swallow neer the House of God: where like a Primitive Saint he offered more Prayers in the night, then others usually offer in the day; there he penned these Poems,</hi> Steps
<pb facs="tcp:101362:4"/>
for happy Souls to climb Heaven by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And those other of his pieces, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled,</hi> The Delights of the Muses, <hi>(though of a more Humane mixture) are as sweet as they are innocent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The praises that follow are but few of many that might be conferr'd on him, he was excellent in Five Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages (besides his Mother-Tongue)</hi> viz. Hebrew, Greek, Latine, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, Spanish, <hi>the two last whereof he had little help in, they were of his own acquisition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amongst his other accomplishments in Academick (as well Pious as Harmless) Arts, he made his skill in Poetry, Musick, Drawing, Limming, Graving, (exercises of his curious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention and sudden fancy) to be but his subservient recreations for vacant hours, not the grand business of his soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101362:5"/>
               <hi>To the former Qualifications I might add that which would crown them all, his rare moderation in Diet (almost Lessian Temperance) he never created a Muse out of distempers, nor (with our Canary Scriblers) cast any strange mists of Surfets before the intellectual beams of his Mind or Memory, the latter of which he was so much a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of, that he had there under Lock and Key in readiness, the richest Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the best</hi> Greek <hi>and</hi> Latine <hi>Poets, some of which Authors he had more at his command by heart, then others that only read their Works, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain little, and understand less.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Enough Reader, I intend not a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of praises, larger then this Book, nor need I longer transport thee to think over his vast perfections,</hi> I <hi>will conclude all that I have impartially writ of this Learned young Gentleman</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:101362:5"/>
               <hi>(now dead to us) as he himself doth, with the last Line of his Poem upon Bishop</hi> Andrews<hi>'s Picture before his Sermons.</hi>

                  <l>A soul, whose intellectual beams</l>
                  <l>No Mists do Mask, no Lazy steams,</l>
                  <l>A happy soul, that all the way</l>
                  <l>To Heav'n rides in a Summers day.</l>
                  <l>Would'st see a man, whose well-warm'd Blood</l>
                  <l>Baths him in a genuine Flood!</l>
                  <l>A man whose tuned humours be</l>
                  <l>A seat of rarest harmony?</l>
                  <l>Would'st see blith looks, fresh Cheeks beguile</l>
                  <l>Age? wouldst see <hi>December</hi> smile?</l>
                  <l>Would'st see Nests of new Roses grow</l>
                  <l>In a bed of reverend Snow?</l>
                  <l>Warm Thoughts, free Spirits flattering</l>
                  <l>Winter's self into a Spring.</l>
                  <l>In summe, would'st see a man that can</l>
                  <l>Live to be old, and still a man?</l>
                  <l>Whose latest and most leaden hours</l>
                  <l>Fall with soft wings, stuck with soft flowers;</l>
                  <l>And when Life's sweet Fable ends,</l>
                  <l>Soul and Body part like friends;</l>
                  <l>No quarrels, murmurs, no delay;</l>
                  <l>A kiss, a Sigh, and so away.</l>
                  <l>This rare one, Reader, wouldst thou see?</l>
                  <l>Hark hither; and thy self be he.</l>
