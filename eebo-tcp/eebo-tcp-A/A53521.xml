            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO HER
Royal Highness
THE
DUTCHESS.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Madam,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AFTER having a great while wisht to write
something that might be worthy to lay
at your Highnesses Feet, and finding it
impossible: Since the World has been so kind to
me to Judge of this Poem to my advantage, as the
most pardonable fault which I have made in its
kind; I had sinn'd against my self, if I had not
chosen this Opportunity to implore (what my Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
is most fond of) your Favour and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
            <p>For though Fortune would not so far
bless my endeavours, as to encourage them with
your Royal Highnesses presence, when this came
into the World: Yet, I cannot but declare it
was my design and hopes it might have been
your Divertisement in that happy season, when
you return'd again to chear all those eyes that had
before wept for your Departure, and enliven all
hearts that had droopt for your Absence: When
<pb facs="tcp:59654:3"/>
Wit ought to have pay'd it's Choicest Tributes in,
and Joy have known no Limits, then I hop'd my
little Mite would not have been rejected; though
my ill Fortune was too hard for me, and I lost a
greater Honour, by your Royal Highnesses Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
than all the Applauses of the World besides
can make me Reparation for.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, I thought my self not quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy,
so long as I had hopes this way yet to
recompence my disappointment past: When I
consider'd also that Poetry might claim right to a
little share in your Favour: For <hi>Tasso,</hi> and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osto,</hi>
some of the best, have made their Names E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
by transmitting to after-Ages the Glory of
your Ancestors: And under the spreading of that
shade, where two of the best have plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Lawrels, how Honoured should I
be, who am the worst, if but a branch might
grow for me.</p>
            <p>I dare not think of offering at any thing in this
Address, that might look like a Panegyrick, for
fear lest when I have done my best, the World
should Condemn me, for saying too little, and
you your self check me, for medling with a Task
unfit for my Talent.</p>
            <p>For the description of Vertues, and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
so rare as yours are, ought to be done by as
deliberate, as skillful a Hand; the Features
must be drawn very fine, to be like, hasty dawb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
would but spoil the Picture, and make it so
unnatural, as must want false lights to set it off:
<pb facs="tcp:59654:3"/>
And your Vertue can receive no more Lustre from
Praises, than your Beauty can be improv'd by
Art; which as it Charms the bravest Prince that
ever amaz'd the World with his Virtue: So let
but all other Hearts enquire into themselves, and
then Judge how it ought to be prais'd.</p>
            <p>Your Love too, as none but that great Heroe
who has it could deserve it, and therefore, by a
particular Lot from Heav'n, was destin'd to so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
a blessing, so matchless for itself, and so
wondrous for it's Constancy, shall be remembred
to your Immortal Honour, when all other Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
of the Age you live in shall be forgotten.</p>
            <p>But I forget that I am to ask Pardon for the
fault I have been all this while Committing:
wherefore I beg your Highness to forgive me this
presumption, and that you will be pleas'd to think
well of one who cannot help resolving with all
the Actions of Life, to endeavour to deserve it:
Nay more, I would beg, and hope it may be
granted, that I may through yours never want an
Advocate in his Favour, whose Heart, and Mind,
you have so entire a share in; it is my only Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and my Fortune; I cannot but be happy, so long
as I have but hopes I may enjoy it, and I must be
Miserable, should it ever be my ill Fate to lose it.</p>
            <p>This, with Eternal wishes for your Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
Content, Happiness, and Prosperity, in all
Humility is presented by</p>

            <l>TO you, great Iudges in this Writing Age,</l>
            <l>The sons of Wit, and Patrons of the Stage,</l>
            <l>With all those humble thoughts, which still have sway'd</l>
            <l>His Pride, much doubting, trembling and affraid</l>
            <l>Of what is to his want of merit due,</l>
            <l>And aw'd by every Excellence in you,</l>
            <l>The Author sends to beg you would be kind,</l>
            <l>And spare those many faults you needs must find.</l>
            <l>You to whom Wit a Common Foe is grown,</l>
            <l>The thing ye scorn, and publickly disown;</l>
            <l>Though now perhaps y'are here for other ends,</l>

            <l>For he ne're call'd ye yet insipid Tools;</l>
            <l>Nor wrote one line to tell you ye were Fools:</l>
            <l>But says of Wit ye have so large a store,</l>
            <l>So very much, you never will have more.</l>
            <l>He ne're with Libel treated yet the Town,</l>
            <l>The names of Honest men bedawb'd and shown,</l>
            <l>Nay, never once lampoon'd the harmless life</l>
            <l>Of Suburb Virgin, or of City Wife:</l>
            <l>Satyr's the effect of Poetries disease;</l>
            <l>Which, sick of a lew'd Age, she vents for Ease,</l>
            <l>But now her only strife should be to please.</l>
            <l>Since of ill Fate the baneful Cloud's withdrawn;</l>
            <l>And happiness again begins to dawn,</l>
            <l>Since back with Joy and Triumph he is come,</l>
            <l>That always drove Fears hence, he're brought 'em home.</l>
            <l>Oft has he plough'd the boist'rous Ocean o're,</l>

            <l>Should it prove so, I'd fain amongst you find,</l>
            <l>Who 'tis would to the fatherless be kind.</l>
            <l>To whose protection might I safely go?</l>
            <l>Is there amongst you no good Nature? No.</l>
            <l>What should I do? should I the Godly seek,</l>
            <l>And go a Conventicling twice a Week?</l>
            <l>Quit the lewd Stage, and its prophane pollution,</l>
            <l>Affect each Form and Saint-like Institution,</l>
            <l>So draw the Brethren all to Contribution?</l>
            <l>Or shall I (is I guess the Poet may</l>
            <l>Within these three days) fairly run away?</l>
            <l>No, to some City Lodgings I'll retire,</l>
            <l>Seem very grave, and privacy desire:</l>
            <l>Till I am thought some Heiress rich in Lands,</l>
            <l>Fled to escape a cruel Guardian's hands;</l>
            <l>Which may produce a Story worth the telling,</l>
            <l>Of the next Sparks that go a Fortune-stealing.</l>
