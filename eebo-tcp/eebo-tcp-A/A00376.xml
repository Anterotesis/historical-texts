            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

For of truth our mother the holy church hath in her none so hygh a treasure nor nothyng of more excellent dignite, than is the promotion where vnto she is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb facs="tcp:10449:3"/>
by the wonderfull benifyte of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloude of our sauyoure Christe by vertu wherof, she beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myth to be ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de one with christ both in nature and sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>staunce ye and therto is as it were trans<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>formed into god, and surely there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge more effectuall, to norishe in her a perfighte and an indyssoluble concord: Than that the same our mother the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholyke church etynge one self body and drynkynge one selfe bloude, by one spirit is made and compact into one body, by whom she also receyuyng lyfe is knyt vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to oure lyuynge heade christe, and yet do we nowe se, that al these great benifites &amp; hygh promocions nothwithstandynge, howe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> throughe the slyghtie craftes of our deceytfull &amp; stronge aduersarie Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, it is brought to passe, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same most beneficiall gyfte the sacrament of the body &amp; bloude of our moste mercifull and moste tenderly louynge sauyour, gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto vs to brynge all persons into

vnytie and concorde, hath bene the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wherupon in olde tyme so many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centyons haue rysen, and of late yeares are nowe agayne renewed. Whyle that some there be which do denye that there is any thyng els in the blyssed sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but onely the outwarde tokens of the bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy &amp; bloude of our sauyoure christ. Some others do kuoweledge that Christe is in the sacramente, but yet vnder the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce of bread and wyne. And agayne some there were that sayde howe that through the wordes of consecration, the substauuce of breade and wyne do fyrste peryshe, and so succedeth after the bodye and the bloude of oure sauyoure christe. Some others do holde that our sauiour by the wordes of consecration doeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come breade and wyne, by theyr myndes makynge it but a lyghte matter, that he was once for vs incarnate, and dyd for our sakes become man. There haue also ben some that were called starcoranista,
<pb facs="tcp:10449:4"/>
whiche irreuerent persons deseruyd wel so vyle a name bycause they dyd both im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>magyn and speake so vyly and withoute all reuerence, of so hyghe a Sacrament the countre of Grece also, to disquiet the vnytie of the catholyke church, haue sent forth amongest vs theyr leuanars so cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led bycause they dare presume contrarye to holy scripture, to leaue the vse of pure breade vnleuanyd, and do consecrate in breade whiche is leauanyd. After this hath rysen the debate and stryfe for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuynge of the Sacrament in both the kyndes, but yet as in that matter the hy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ghe Byshoppes haue varyed amongest them selues. For Galacius dyd orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne that all suche parsons shulde be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouyd from the receyuynge of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment in both the kyndes. whiche wolde nedys receyue it but vnder one, whiche ordynaunce he than made, bycause the vse for that tyme was contrarye. There haue some ben also whiche stryuyng for
<pb facs="tcp:10449:4"/>
the matter, haue styfly mayntained that an euyll and synfull priest, had no power to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrate nor that the body of our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyoure christ was receyued of any wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and synfull lyuer. and yet hath it so happenyd that the sondry errours of all these persones haue ben greatly benyfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall vnto the catholyke churche, for tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the meanes of these stormy assaul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes made agaynst her by these instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

He that shall eate &amp; drynke vnworthelye, he shall be gyltie of the body and blode of our lorde. This is and ought to be vnto all christianed men a foundacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> immoueable. But certayne of the auncyent fathers of Christes chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che haue vpon this hygh misteries som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme wrytten darkely, &amp; sometyme they do some to varye one from a nother, yea and somtyme, they do seme to wryte dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly of this blyssed and holy sacrament but all suche darkenesse, and all suche se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge to varye one from a nother, or whan that they do to any readers seme to wryte thynges that do dyffer one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an other, that ought to be ascrybed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the vnspeakeable profou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditie of this hyghe mysterie: or els to theyr ware and syrcomspecte speakynge or wrytynge of the sayd auncyent fathers, which many

And the varyte whiche semyth to be in theyr wrytynges, ryseth here vpon, that somtyme the formes sacramentall them selues be called of them holye tokens.

And howe is it, that those acciden<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes do kepe theyr coloure, theyr smell, theyr sauoure, &amp; also power to fyll lyke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fode, and to make dronken, all whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che qualites the breade and wyne had in them selues afore that they were conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat, also at what moment of tyme, doth the body and bloude of christ begyn to be in the Sacrament? Also at what tyme the body and bolude of christ doth sease to be in the Sacramente? Also whether that after the formes be corrupted any

Also how the bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy of a perfyte man may be vnder so ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyll a broken peace of breade? And many suche other questions which it behouith with sobernes to be entreated of, amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest suche persons as haue theyr wyttes exercysed, in disputynge and reasonynge vpon suche hyghe matters, But as vnto the laye people it doth suffise, yf they do beleue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> after the wordes of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secracion be once by the mynyster spoken ouer the creatures of breade and wyne, that there is incontynent the very body and bloude of our sauyour Christ, which neyther can be deuyded, nor yet receyue any hurte, nor is not mete to receyue any maner in iurye, what so euer chaunces do become of the outward formes. For yf the sacred body of our lorde shulde be throwne into the myer, or into any vyle gonge, or any otherwise (vnto any irreuerent persons
<pb facs="tcp:10449:12"/>
thynkynge) shuld be iniuryd or soyled, in dede the most iniurye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> can be done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. Is whan it is receyued in to the mouth, of a wycked and synfull person, whiche is sore soyled and spotted with greuous and odyble synne. Nowe suerly it is therfore syttynge for oure christian religyon, to entreate and order, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde formes of breade and wyne of the holy sacrament, with all dewe reuerence but as concernynge the very body of our Sauyour it selfe, lyke as god is after his nature is no lesse glorious in a vyle synk than he is in heauen, and can by no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyce of man, or chaunce by man, or other wyse happenynge receyue any hurte or Iniurye, no more can the glorified body of our Sauyour christ, what Iniurye so euer be done vnto the outwarde tokens. And to be brefe agaynst all the doubtes and scrupules of mans weake knowlege Let vs fyrst call into our myndꝭ, the Im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mesurable power of God, vnto whom no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thyng
<pb facs="tcp:10449:13"/>
is impossible. Ye and vnto whom there is nothynge, but it is lyghte to be done, so it be his pleasure, that it shuld so be. And farther more let vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>syder, how inestymable the gyftes of any body glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryfied be, but specially, &amp; incomparablye of the body gloryfied, ye and these hygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly super exaltyd body in glory and honor of oure lorde Iesus. There restyth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nowe no more, but that the thynge of which the veryte is here so sufficyent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto vs perswadyd, may on our parte be worthely worshyppyd, and had in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, and that the thynge whiche we do professe to beleue to be so, we may by matter in dede, declare vnfaynedly that suche is oure beleue, as we do make for. For with howe great a purenes of lyuyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge. With howe moch humble reuerence and with howe moch ferefull tymerous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes oughte this, thryse ye &amp; foure tymes to, worthy to be worshypped mystery, to be receyued, ordered, and entreted, who
<pb facs="tcp:10449:13"/>
can suppose that they do beleue earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and from the bottome of theyr hartes whiche whan this holye mysterye at the masse tyme is in doing do walke vp and downe in the churche, pratyng and Ian<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gelynge togyther? or that (which now in some places is taken vp for a custome) do stande in the market place without the church dores, there spending theyr tyme aboute tellynge of Idell tales? In olde tyme that place was appoynted for peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentes, or for them that were but newe come to our fayth, and had not yet lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned theyr belefe, and so thought them sel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ues not worthye once to entre into the churche dores. Some other or euer the mynisters be shewed vnto the people, at the leuacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tyme, do get them into some tauerne or alehouse, &amp; do in maner leaue the churche empty. What kynde of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or condicion call we this? yf y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> shuldest stande to here a play made but for laugh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, thou woldest indure to take pacience
<pb facs="tcp:10449:14"/>
and abyde styll to the ende, and that the game shoulde be fully done and finished. And canst thou not endure tyll the endyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge of this heauenly mystery be fully done and fynished, all the masse tyme the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelycall sprites do with most humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence stande aboute the altare, thereto do theyr worshyp and lowlye reuerence. He also is there present, whom all the he<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenlye hoostes of blyssed spirites do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre to beholde, and loke vpon, and thou as thoughe theyr were some leude game or playe there in hande, eyther thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyst, and gapyst for werynes, or els thou makest a pratyng there, and tellest some lewde or rybalde talles, or els thou get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test the away strayght to the tauerne. I do se that it is nowe adayes a custome ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken vp amongest many folkes, whiche perauenture ought not to be called wic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked, bycause it doeth some to procede of some deuoute affection, though it be but of man, withoute any dewe and conueni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ent
<pb facs="tcp:10449:14"/>
grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de. For that custome is brought in, contrarye to the olde maner of the church: and in dede not very conuenient so to be, which custome is, that at the sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crynge tyme whyle the mynisters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration be a doyng, the Quyare vsyth to synge some songe, made in the laude of the virgyn Marye, &amp; set forth by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taynynge some prayer made vnto her. But is it fyt and fyttynge at that tyme in the wonderfull presence of the Sone our Redemer to make sute by any prayer vnto the Mother? Suerly yf we wolde nowe in our tyme herein, kepe the auncyent and laudable custome of the churche vsyd in olde seasons, there was at the Leuacyon tyme no maner voyce herde in all the Church but al the people at once bowynge downe them selues to the groundewarde, with theyr styll de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoute myndes dyd gyue thankes vnto god the Father, whiche hath gyuen his sone vnto the death for the saluacyon of
<pb facs="tcp:10449:15"/>
mankynde. And therunto in very deade, doeth the priest a lytell before the leuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, exhorte the people whan he speakyng vnto them sayth. Lyfte vp your hartes. Let vs gyue thankes vnto the lorde oure God. For whyle this vnspeakeable my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steryes be in doynge, nothynge is more conuenient to be done on the peoples be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>haulfe, than to kepe a deuoute and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent scylence. Nor the wonderfull cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryte of our lorde Iesus is by none other meanes more worthyly praysed than by a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon scylence at that tyme of all the people, as the moste effectuall kynde of lowde speakynge, that is in man, whan he speaketh to God before whom all har<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes do lye prostrate and wyde open? So that at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leuacion tyme, whylest that all maner noyses of orgaynes or other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner voyces kepyng a styll and reuerende scylence, the people with theyr bodyes be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ynge inclyned downe wardes and lyftyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge vp theyr hartes, shulde at that tyme,
<pb facs="tcp:10449:15"/>
after that maner speake vnto our lorde and mercyfull god. Yea and that the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple myght the more worthelye worshyp this holy mystery, accordyng to the hygh worthynes therof, the deuouote and god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly conuersation, of the priestꝭ, is no smale helpe and Furtheraunce there vnto. In olde tyme, whan the Churche dyd moste floryshe in deuotion and godly conuersa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, they vsyd no more but one masse which onely the Bysshop dyd execute, as for the multytude of priestes whiche be nowe a dayes, fyrst deuotion and shortly after Lucure, hathe moued the worlde there vnto. And now at the last the thyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge is come here vnto that many persons do learne to synge masse, for none other intent, but as the laye people to mayne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne theyr lyuinges, do lerne theyr han<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy craftes as some do learne to be sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, some to be dawbers or tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rars of morter, and some others to be Taylers, and vnto suche priestes theyr
<pb facs="tcp:10449:16"/>
masse seruyth them for none other inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t but as to be a meane for them to gette theyr lyuing by. In very dede, it is good reason, that he whiche doeth serue the alter shulde lyue of the alter. But yet is it moche requesite that the executoures of this hyghe mysterye shulde rather be mete to execute theyr worthy to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyppyd tome and offyce than to vse it lyke any vyle bartrynge as it were of were for ware or of one marchaundyse for a nother. So that it is not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite for suche mynysters to haue the knowledge of theyr outwarde gestures, and to haue theyr vestementes and voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to theyr offyce accordyng, but it is al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>so moch more requisite that all the hole trade of theyr lyues &amp; conuersation, shul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de be mete and answerable vnto the dig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nite of theyr offyce ye it is suerly a great mater to consyder howe moche sobryete it beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myth for a priest to haue of what pure chastyte oughte he to be and howe
<pb facs="tcp:10449:16"/>
moch ought he to be garnyshed with all maner clennes of lyuinges what conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt and dyspysynge also oughte there to be in them of all such voluptuous pleasures as the comyn people do delyte in. And spe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyally what great &amp; feruent loue oughte there to be in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> towardes the dyligent and contynuall redyng of holy scripture. And how moche vnsyttyng and vncome<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly is it for a priest incontinenty after the selebratynge of such a godly and deuyne mysterye, to consume all the resydue of the daye, eyther in gullynge, and dryu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge or intellynge or heryng of vyle ry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>balde tales, or to syt playeng at the dysce or at the cardes, or to go a huntynge all daye to cast away the tyme in Idell wan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derynge aboute to and fro, and eyther to bestowe no parte of al the day besydes or els very lytell therof, eyther in redyng of any holy auctours or in any medytaci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on or contemplaciton of heauenly thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, let all priestes therfore consyder the
<pb facs="tcp:10449:17"/>
hyghnes of theyr professyon, whan they do stand at the alter. They haue Angels to mynister vnto them, whan they be de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>parted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, some of them do make it but a lyght matter incontinenty after to gyt them into companye of the moste vyle dregges of man bycause I wolde here vse no mo wordes which myght be sharpelyer spoken I praye God that the vnworthy conuersacion of those whiche do take vpon them a mynistracio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is aboue the dignite of Aungels, do not gyue occasyon vnto herytykes to concey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue a wycked opinion of so vnspeakeable mystery, but let all ministers by theyr de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uoute and godly conuersacion so deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne them selues on theyr party, that oure lorde on his party maye honour them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne.
