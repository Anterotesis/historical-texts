         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Whereas Wee haue alwayes held it one of the most and necessary cares and considerations incident to the State and Office of Kings and Soueraigne Princes, so to dispose of their people and gouernment, as the knowledge and vse of good and profitable Arts and Inuentions may become common and frequent among their people, the same being one of the greatest meanes to encrease and preserue the wealth and strength of State and people, considering how contrary effects Labour and Idlenesse doe produce; the one making King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes great and flourishing, the other, alwayes bearing the markes of beggerie and contempt: Forasmuch as some of Our good and louing Subiects of Our Realme of England, haue of late to their great charge, and no lesse commendation, found out, and made proofe of sundry Mines in Our Countie of Yorke, and elsewhere within Our Realme of England, for the making of <hi>Allome,</hi> a Merchandize of great necessitie, and vse sundry wayes for all Our Dominions, and did so well and commendably proceed therein, as that they were able to make sufficient store of <hi>Allome,</hi> not onely to serue for the vse and expence of all Our said Kingdomes, but also to afford and spare great quantities thereof, to be euery yeere Transported for the vse and seruice of Our neighbour King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Nations: And whereas the said persons by their skill and industrie, haue effected so good and great a worke, haue willingly and freely offered and yeelded vp the same <hi>Allome</hi> Mines into Our hands, vpon such conditions and considerations, as haue giuen them full contentment and satisfaction, all men being able to iudge, that a matter of that consequence, and wherein so many of Our people should be interessed, was more fit for Us to take into Our handes, then to leaue the same in the power of priuate men: For which causes and considerations, Wee haue caused the said whole Worke to bee taken into Our possession, and of late haue disbursed great summes of

And albeit that by meanes of the <hi>Allome</hi> made and to be made within Our said Realmes, Wee shall receiue great hinderance in Our Customes, and other dueties, formerly payed vnto Us and Our predecessours, Kings and Queenes of this Realme, for and vpon that commoditie imported; yet Wee, that in all Our actions and proceedings haue Our eye of Grace rather vpon the flourishing estate of Our Kingdomes, and the comfort of Our people, then vpon Our profite, haue resolued rather to quit and forsake such benefit vnto Our owne Coffers, then to interrupt or ouerthrow so excellent a Worke, of Our care and Princely pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, for the welfare of Our Subiects.</p>
            <p>These are therefore to require and command all and singuler person and persons whatsoeuer, aswell Our naturall borne Subiects, as Denizons or Strangers, That none of them, nor any other person or persons whatsoeuer, doe at any time or times hereafter, attempt or presume to bring, or cause to be brought into these Our Realmes of England, Scotland, or Ireland, or any other Our Dominions, or into any the Ports, Hauens, Creekes, or places of any of them, any <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lome,</hi> in greater or lesser quantities, made or to be made in any forraigne part or place whatsoeuer, or of <hi>Allome</hi> made here within this Kingdome, after that the same hath bene exported, vpon paine of forfeiture of all and euery quantitie and quantities of <hi>Allome,</hi> so brought, or caused to be brought into Our said Dominions, contrary to this Our present commandement: All which said <hi>Allome</hi> brought and to be Imported and forfeited, Our will and pleasure is, that such person and persons as shall make seizure of the same <hi>Allome,</hi> shall foorthwith conuey the same <hi>Allome</hi> to the Warehouse of <hi>Robert Iohnson</hi> Merchant, one of Our Agents for that businesse, lying in Our Citie of <hi>London,</hi> where hee so bringing and deliuering the same, shall haue and receiue of Our said Agent, vpon the deliuery thereof, the full summe of Twelue pounds for euery Tunne of <hi>Allome,</hi> and so ratably Twelue shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings for euery Hundreth weight of such, and so much as hee and they shall bring thither; to the end that the same <hi>Allome,</hi> shall be with all conuenient speed Exported out of this Kingdome into some forreigne parts beyond the Seas, so as no forraigne <hi>Allome</hi> be sold, spent or vsed, within these Our said Realmes or Dominions, or any part thereof; And also vpon paine of Our high indignation and displeasure, and of such further paines, penalties and punishments, as for the contempt of Our commandement Royall in this behalfe, may any way be inflicted vpon them, or any of them so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, contrary to the true intent and meaning herein signified.</p>

And neuerthelesse Wee doe hereby signifie and declare, That whereas Wee did publish a former Proclamation of this nature, bearing date the Nineteenth day of Iune, in the seuenth yeere of Our Raigne, that Our intention is, that the same (as to all offences past,) doe stand in full force, any thing in this present Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
