            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Up he did climb, and is supposed to sleep there all Night, but the next Morning was found stone dead upon the Flower, his Hat remained on the top of the <hi>Barley-Mow</hi>; How he fell down is unknown, because no body was in the Barn when he Fell: It was a Clay Flower, where his Head pitched on a Peble-stone, which brake a hole in his Skul, and let out much Blood and Water.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>SOlomon</hi> saith, <hi>That a word fitly spoken, is like Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver,</hi> Prov. <hi>25.11.</hi> That is to say, it hath all that may Invite our Attention. Surely then it is a fit time to speak to the Ear, when God, by any dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Iudgement doth speak to the Eye. Although my Mouth is stopped at present, and I am denied to Speak unto you in the Pulpit, yet no Law can hinder me from Writing unto you; and the End of my Writing at this time is to exhort you to hear God, now loudly speaking unto every one of us by the dismal Iudgment upon <hi>John Woolman,</hi> calling on every one of us to Repent and Turn from our sinful Courses, and more particularly calling upon every <hi>Drunkard</hi> to forsake his <hi>Drunkenness,</hi> beholding the Woful Effects of that Sin in this sad Example. It will not become a <hi>Minister</hi> to Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the Faults of the Dead, my desire is to press upon the Living to lay his woful End to heart.</p>
            <p>Would you not have the Iudgments of God to Cut you off in your Sins, and to stop your Breath, before you have time to ask Pardon? then be Exhorted and Perswaded to <hi>Repent, to day while it is called to day, and do not harden your Hearts any longer against such Warnings as this.</hi> We say, <hi>It is best striking while the Iron's hot,</hi> Therefore admit this <hi>Word of Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> while there is some Warmth remaining upon your Souls, by that which you have seen or heard of the sudden Death of this poor Wretch; <hi>Happy and wise are those who take Warning by other Mens Harms.</hi> Let me desire you to Read frequently those words, <hi>Proverbs 29.1. He that being often Reproved, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eneth his Neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32733:3"/>
Remedy.</hi> Mayer, on those words saith, <hi>For all sins there is forgiveness, but for hardness of Heart and Neck, there is none</hi>; and therefore, such cannot escape Destruction. And then a Man is judged to be thus <hi>Hardned,</hi> when being often <hi>Reproved,</hi> he relenteth not, but goeth on obstinately still in his Sins. Hear this, all ye <hi>Swearers,</hi> and <hi>Drunkards</hi> of <hi>Sarret</hi>; and though it is not a seemly thing to name Persons, and say, you <hi>John,</hi> or you <hi>Thomas,</hi> or you <hi>Richard</hi>; yet, I beseech the Lord, to set it home on every Soul particularly, both mine and yours, throughout the Parish, and let those <hi>Drunkards,</hi> who are so busy to erect a New <hi>Alehouse</hi> in the Town, take notice, how God threatneth such doings, and let them desist from their <hi>Enterprize,</hi> lest God mark them out to be the next <hi>Examples</hi> of <hi>his Wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They sufficiently tell the World, what they are that thrust out their <hi>Minister,</hi> and endeavour to set up another <hi>Alehouse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God has set me as your <hi>Watchman,</hi> Ezek. <hi>33.7, 8, 9.</hi> Turn to it, and read it your selves. Therefore, that I may <hi>free my own Soul,</hi> and <hi>that the Blood of impenitent Sinners may not be required at my hands,</hi> have I written this <hi>Letter,</hi> to be read in your hearing.</p>
            <p>Doth not God say to the <hi>wicked Drunkard, Thou shalt sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly die,</hi> when he shews him a <hi>Drunkard</hi> struck dead suddenly? <hi>I</hi> beseech you therefore all my Christian Neighbours, take these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Considerations home to your Hearts, to make you hate <hi>Drunkenness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Consider what a Brutish, Beastly kind of Sin <hi>Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is</hi>; and there is no Beast, that I ever read of, that will drink to be <hi>drunk,</hi> but the <hi>Swine,</hi> to which a <hi>Drunkard</hi> is most like; a <hi>Drunkard</hi> makes his <hi>Belly</hi> like a <hi>Hogshead,</hi> to be filled with <hi>Strong-Drink,</hi> his <hi>Throat</hi> is the <hi>Tunnel</hi> to let it down; until, by overbriming his <hi>Vessel,</hi> he force it to run out at his Mouth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; if once the strong Liquor begin to work in his <hi>Guts,</hi> it flies up to his <hi>Brain,</hi> and quickly drowns the <hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>robs</hi> him of all that should bespeak him a <hi>Man,</hi> and layes a <hi>Swine</hi> in his Room, you cannot say, that now he <hi>utters,</hi> but <hi>mutters</hi> his <hi>words,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:32733:4"/>
his <hi>Tongue</hi> greatly labouring to <hi>speak,</hi> but lying <hi>drowned</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nder <hi>Water,</hi> is not able to bring forth any sensible <hi>Words,</hi> you may discover an <hi>Ape</hi> in every Posture of him, and he goes, Like what? no <hi>Comparison</hi> can be <hi>vile enough,</hi> unless you will say, <hi>That he goes like himself,</hi> or like another <hi>Drunkard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Consider what <hi>heinous Aggravations</hi> this Sin ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitts of; As,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>mispending</hi> that <hi>precious Time</hi> in <hi>bad Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and <hi>Tippling-Houses,</hi> which he ought to <hi>redeem,</hi> to <hi>work out his Salvation</hi>; a <hi>Saint</hi> may be distinguished from a <hi>Sinner by this Character,</hi> as well as others. The <hi>Saint</hi> is desirous to <hi>redeem Time,</hi> the <hi>Sinners</hi> great Study is, <hi>how to drive away Time</hi>; the <hi>Saint</hi> spends his time in <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Lawfull Busy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> the <hi>Sinner</hi> mispends his time in <hi>drinking</hi> and <hi>unlawful Sports</hi>; so that a <hi>Drunkard</hi> wilfully throws away his <hi>precious Time,</hi> as if it were a <hi>Burthen</hi> to him, and seeks for <hi>Damnation</hi> in that <hi>Time</hi> which is allotted him to seek for <hi>Salvation</hi>; and how inexcusable is that <hi>Sinner</hi> that will not be saved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Consider how one <hi>Drunkard</hi> makes many more Partakers of his Sin. <hi>Drunkenness</hi> is a <hi>sociable Vice,</hi> and the <hi>Drunkard</hi> calls himself <hi>a Good Fellow.</hi> It is very rare, that a Man should drink himself <hi>drunk</hi> alone; love of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi> makes many <hi>drunk,</hi> who say they do not love <hi>Drink.</hi> And the <hi>Devil</hi> hath found a rare <hi>Expedient</hi> to help forward this <hi>Sin,</hi> by <hi>Drinking of Healths.</hi> If any one begin a <hi>Health,</hi> it is now reckoned a great Piece of <hi>Rudeness,</hi> not to stay to pledge it; yes, and not to drink all that is filled unto you; the <hi>Healths</hi> forsooth, must go round by any means. If the Devills in Hell be capable of <hi>Laughing,</hi> surely this might make them <hi>Laugh,</hi> to see how eagerly <hi>Drunkards</hi> are working out their own <hi>Damnation,</hi> and by this <hi>Stratagem, drinking away</hi> the <hi>Health</hi> of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> both, and pulling many others into <hi>Hell</hi> with them by this <hi>Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Stratagem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Consider what a <hi>wasting Sin Drunkenness is</hi>? the <hi>Drunkard</hi> consumes, that <hi>Money</hi> on his <hi>Vice,</hi> which should main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:32733:4"/>
his <hi>Family,</hi> and how many good <hi>Estates</hi> have been wasted by this Sin? How many have drunk <hi>Ale</hi> so long, until they have been forced to sell <hi>Ale</hi> for a <hi>Livelyhood?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Drunkard</hi> poures it in by <hi>whole Flagons,</hi> while his <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> would be glad of a <hi>Draught</hi> of <hi>Small Beer</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Consider that this <hi>Sin</hi> of <hi>Drunkenness</hi> exposeth to every <hi>Sin,</hi> I have formerly told you a remarkeable Story, which I read in a Book called <hi>(Tragica) Page 117.</hi> in <hi>Latine,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins thus: <hi>Quidam cum Pietate sedulo studeret, assiduis Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aboli Tentationibus infestabatur, suadentis ut ex tribu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Consider how <hi>Drunkenness</hi> incapacitates a Man for all <hi>Duties,</hi> and for all <hi>Cevil Actions; Brawling,</hi> and <hi>Quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> and <hi>Fighting,</hi> and often <hi>Murder,</hi> have been the Woful Fruits of <hi>Drunkenness.</hi>

               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Consider how often the Lord doth punish some <hi>Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> with <hi>sudden Death,</hi> to warn others; how many have fallen into the <hi>Water,</hi> and have been drowned? some have tumbled down <hi>Stairs</hi> (as I knew one in <hi>London</hi> came in <hi>Drunk,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of going <hi>up Stairs,</hi> fell down into his <hi>Cellar,</hi> and never

            <p>Let me close up this <hi>Exhortation</hi> with these Words, <hi>Psal. 50.22. Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.</hi>
