         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THIS Diſcourſe, which firſt came to life in Your
Royal Brother's, his late Majeſty's Reign, (of moſt
happy memory to theſe Nations) being now of
Age to appear abroad, doth humbly proſtrate it ſelf at Your
Majeſty's Feet; not doubting Your moſt gracious Acceptance,
if but for the End and Deſign it propoſes and carries with it:
Which is no other, than to ſtir up and provoke Your Majeſty's
Subjects Abroad, (and even at Home alſo) to uſe at leaſt
ſome endeavours for the <hi>propagation of Chriſtianity</hi>
among their domeſtick Slaves and Vaſſals; (together with the
other numerous Heathen in Your Majeſty's Colonies) who for
the general are moſt ambitious thereof, were their Deſires ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
by ſuitable Inclinations in their Owners, ſo as to afford
it to them. A Duty moſt certainly ſo indiſpenſibly neceſſary,
and abſolutely incumbent upon all, but eſpecially the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
and refined Chriſtians, that it may juſtly ſeem a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of greateſt admiration and aſtoniſhment, to but obſerve
that it has hitherto been ſo much neglected; yea, and not only
neglected, but (I cannot expreſs it without ſhame and horror!)
even ſcoffe at and oppoſed by them. An impiety, which tho be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not wholly unknown to Your Majeſty, (as having been,
by a very reverend and worthy Perſon, of near Relation to
Your Majeſty, ſome time ſince repreſented to Your Majeſty)
<pb facs="tcp:100722:3"/>
is yet but newly arrived within Your Power to remedy. But
for the which we have the greateſt aſſurance, to wit, Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Royal Word then paſſed upon that Your firſt notice
thereof. Your Majeſty being thereupon pleaſed, not only to
teſtify Your higheſt reſentment and abhorrence of ſo prophane
an Abuſe, but withal giving most manifest Indications of
Your Deſires for its reformation and redreſs. And like a
most religious Aſſertor, and zealous Patron of the Faith once
delivered to the Saints; Your Majeſty declaring it most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
that all Men ſhould be made to partake of <hi>the Grace
of God,</hi> ſo freely in <hi>Chriſt</hi> tendred unto them; and that
none ſhould be debarred of the <hi>common Salvation,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſuch who do ſo much <hi>hunger and thirſt after it.</hi> And at
the ſame inſtant, no leſs admiring, that any pretence of Reaſon
ſhould by Chriſtians (and thoſe too of the beſt ſort) be offered
to the contrary; much leſs ſo reſolutely, and with ſo much
pertinacy be defended and perſisted in. And when in refutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that no leſs impudent than moſt impious Aſſertion, of the
<hi>Impracticableneſs</hi> thereof, at leaſt in thoſe Parts; it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
and urged, that it could not poſsibly be leſs practicable
to us, than to other Nations; particularly to the <hi>French,</hi> who
in the Iſland of St. <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> (half whereof is peopled
by that Nation, but the reſt poſſeſſed by your Majesty's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects)
without finding any either miſchief or inconvenience
conſequent thereupon, are known to confer Baptiſm upon all
that ſort of People: Whilst the <hi>Engliſh</hi> upon the ſame Spot,
do most ſacrilegiouſly reject and give it up for impoſsible:
Upon the hearing whereof, Your Majesty being fully convinced
<pb facs="tcp:100722:3"/>
and ſatisfied, was pleaſed to allow the <hi>Argument for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable;</hi>
and withal to add, <hi>That if ever it ſhould
happen to fall in Your way, Your Majeſty would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it all you could.</hi> The due performance whereof, no
one that understands Your Veracity and Zeal, will in the least
ſuſpect.</p>
            <p>As for this ſo abſurd an Impiety, their pretence is, the
advance of Trade and Commerce, which they are not aſhamed
to ſet up in oppoſition to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and Religion. But Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
cannot but know how unworthy (even at the beſt) this
Plea is of a Christian Nation: and withal, how incongruous
and mean it is that for Trade (even allowing the Pretence
for good) <hi>the Work of God ſhould be deſtroyed;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 15, 20.</note> and
thoſe Myriads of Souls be <hi>made to periſh, for whom
Chriſt died,</hi> no leſs than for the reſidue of Mankind.</p>
            <p>It would be alſo conſidered, as we doubt not but Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
will, what returns, after ſo long poſſeſsion, we have made,
or rather, what <hi>deſpite to the Spirit of Grace</hi> we have
done, in hindring thoſe poor Heathens Salvation, which we
ought with our utmoſt Zeal and Induſtry, to have promoted;
The very end, as muſt be piouſly ſuppoſed, for which it at firſt
pleaſed Almighty God to diſcover to us, and to poſſeſs us of
thoſe many large and fruitful Countries: Whilst we prefer our
<hi>Trade</hi> and our <hi>Mammon</hi> before it, as of the greater value.
And when all other Religions, even to the very Turks and
New-England-men, do <hi>compaſs Sea and Land to create
Proſelites;</hi> we only do ſeem to fetch the ſame compaſs to
continue them Heathens. An abomination which both threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
<pb facs="tcp:100722:4"/>
and calls aloud for Vengeance from Heaven upon the
most wicked Authors: Unleſs Your Majeſty's extraordinary
Piety and Goodneſs ſhall ſuddenly interpoſe, and ſo at once
put a ſtop to the Sin and to the Judgment. <hi>And who
knows whether Your Majeſty be not come to the
Kingdom for ſuch a Time as this?</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I ſhall only be bold to detain Your Majeſty with a ſhort
but pious Speech of a certain great Prince, one of the late
Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> uttered to Your Majeſty's bleſſed Father, <hi>of
moſt glorious memory,</hi> whilst reſiding in that Kingdom;
Who indiſcourſe, taking occaſion to magnify that King's ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Dominions; He, in anſwer thereto, was pleaſed to reply,
<hi>That 'twas true,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>God had entruſted him with divers
Nations and Countries; but that his Advantage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
was, to have opportunity to propagate Chriſtian
Religion.</hi> It is to be preſumed, that as Your Majeſty's
Dominions, in the Parts we ſpeak of, are in extent not much
ſhort of, perhaps a great deal larger, than that Princes: So
your Majeſty's Piety will not ſuffer You to be wanting to Your
Self and People, in reaping the like bleſſed and glorious Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
thereby. So prayeth,</p>

            <p>I Cannot but foreſee, that I ſhall fall under no ſmall danger of
Cenſure, as well for my firſt preaching, as now publiſhing this
Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>For beſides the ſiniſter Surmiſes of divers here at home,
(ſuch, who like the Curr in the Manger, will neither eat Oats them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
nor ſuffer thoſe that would); I muſt alſo look to undergo,
as far as is poſſible, the utmoſt Effects of the Rage and Malice of
thoſe incenſed <hi>MAMMONISTS</hi> from abroad; who, I am to
expect, will not fail, by their Agents and Partizans, to diſpenſe to
me the ſharpeſt Revenge and Miſchief, that ſuch Enemies of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi>
can contrive againſt a Promoter of it. And, when they thus
ſee me upon <hi>taking away their Gods,</hi> it will be but a very ſenſleſs and
unreaſonable Queſtion to demand, <hi>What aileth them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as there was no temptation from the thing it ſelf, as being like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to prove ſo invidious and coſtly an Undertaking, what I have but
too much already felt; and it being on the behalf of ſuch who are
never like to make me any amends, and I am ſure that no body elſe
will: So I hope that others better diſpoſed, will in charity, which
thinketh not the worſt, rather believe, that what I have herein attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
doth proceed from no worſe Motive, than from a ſenſe of my
Duty; as not knowing otherwiſe, what I yet knew was moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
how to reprove the<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts 13. 6, 7,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Bar-Jeſus,</hi> or <hi>Elymas,</hi> did op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Chriſtianity, as not believing it; but theſe whilſt they profeſs it, do yet oppoſe it.</note> 
               <hi>BARJES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ITISM</hi>
and baſe <hi>Mammoniſm</hi> ſo openly practiſed in our <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi>
and even at Home too; of which I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
give ſome Inſtances. At leaſt certainly I can
deſerve no blame for thus <hi>opening my Mouth for the
Dumb,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 31. 8.</note> and becoming their Advocate, who are <hi>appointed to Eternal
Deſtruction:</hi> For that I have, as it were, <hi>put my Life in my hand,</hi> to
oppoſe thoſe <hi>Elymas's,</hi> who do <hi>not ceaſe to pervert the right Ways of the
Lord,</hi> and to obſtruct <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> when no body elſe either durſt or
would. And ſince the more Learned and Prudent, who never uſe
to lay out themſelves but to ſome purpoſe (and this, 'tis too well
known known, is but a barren Theme), had hitherto been ſilent
therein, that I thought it no diſparagement to become a <hi>Fool for
Chriſt's ſake,</hi> and conceived that it might better be done by me,
than not at all.</p>
            <p>Theſe in truth were my Reaſons in general for this Undertaking;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100722:5"/>
but there was withal a more particular. And that was, hereby, if
poſſible, to put ſome ſtop to, and to abate the arrogant and proud
vauntings of that new Sect of American Anti-Religioniſts, the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſuits</hi>
and <hi>Elymaſes</hi> before mentioned, for their Victory over <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi>
by <hi>L<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CYfer</hi> and his fellow Agents, here ſometime

no appearance of any, no not at the greateſt diſtance, <hi>(for they were

upon the ſcore of their <hi>Mammon,</hi> freely communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to them their Religion; which that People then
embracing, are ſaid to retain to this very day.</p>
            <p>But to leave theſe remote Parts, where Men may perhaps be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to act what they pleaſe, without controul, let us come nearer
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100722:6"/>
Home, to our own moſt <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Iſland, and even to <hi>England</hi> it ſelf, and
there ſee how much better the caſe is, to is in time like to prove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
our ſelves; where we ſhall find this ſuperlative Wickedneſs
to have ſpread amain, even from Sea to Sea; infected both the <hi>Eaſt</hi>
and <hi>Weſt,</hi> and gotten poſſeſſion of the very heart of this Kingdom.
I have been told, that when this Sermon was firſt preached in <hi>London,</hi>
the Pariſh Clark, after all was done, fell to wondring that I ſhould
thus trouble my ſelf to preach againſt <hi>Negro</hi>'s and <hi>Indians,</hi> for that
he ſaid, there were <hi>none of that Religion</hi> in this Nation. But how
much this poor Clark was miſtaken, I ſhall from ſome four or five
Inſtances, out of a great many which I have heard, ſoon diſcover.</p>
            <p>Whereof the firſt that I ſhall mention, is of a Gentlewoman, who
commending a certain <hi>Negro</hi> Wench that ſhe had, for her towardli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and other good qualities, in the hearing of a Miniſter; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of her, why ſhe made her not a <hi>Chriſtian?</hi> Whereat, caſting
her eyes ſtrangely on him, and greatly wondring, ſhe replied, That
ſhe had thought he would have given her better Counſel.</p>
            <p>The next ſhall be of a poor Wretch of the like ſort, belonging to
a certain Lady, at that time reſiding in a place ſome ſeventy miles
diſtant from <hi>London:</hi> With this <hi>Negro,</hi> a certain religious Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
condeſcended to diſcourſe, and to perſwade to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi>
unto which ſhe found him very inclinable; but was interrupted by
the Lady, who overhearing the Diſcourſe, thereupon ran in;
and, as in a moſt hideous affrightment, cryed out, <hi>O, for God's</hi> (ſhe
might better have ſaid the Devil's) <hi>ſake,</hi> ſay no more to him of that.
And ſo the Diſcourſe ended.</p>
            <p>The third Inſtance ſhall be of a <hi>Negro,</hi> whoſe Owner lived nearer
<hi>London, viz.</hi> within ſome four or five miles diſtance of it. This <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro</hi>
preſented himſelf to the Miniſter, I think not of his own, but of
a neighbouring Pariſh, deſiring Baptiſm at his hands; For which the
Miniſter finding him not unqualified, did not abſolutely refuſe it,
nor yet at preſent grant it him; 'tis poſſible, as being of another Pariſh.
But however, the Maſter coming to the knowledg thereof, forthwith
ſends a peremptory Meſſage to the Miniſter, charging him upon his
peril not to proceed.</p>
            <p>The fourth is of a <hi>Negro,</hi> whoſe Owner reſided ſomewhere near
<hi>Bristol,</hi> (the places name I have forgotten); This <hi>Negro</hi> alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
himſelf to the Miniſter, beſeeching Baptiſm; For the which
the Miniſter finding him not incompetently fitted, did not deny it
him; only deferred it for the preſent. All which ſoon after arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to the Maſter's jealous ear, he, with the like terrible Menaces,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100722:6"/>
dehorted the Miniſter; adding withal, this inſolent enquiry, <hi>Whether he would bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
his Horſe?</hi> But perceiving that the Miniſter little regarded his Menaces or Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
he goes home, and inſtantly chains the <hi>Negro</hi> under the Table among his
Dogs, and there continues him in that double bondage for ſome time; till finding him
thereby to become unſerviceable, which is all they regard; he at length releaſeth
him of his Chain, but with this ſtrict charge, not to go any more to the Miniſter.
Which the <hi>Negro</hi> not obſerving, the Miniſter, like one that underſtood his Office, and
that believed himſelf obliged to pay a greater reſpect to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Commands, of <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
all Nations,</hi> than to that Infidel <hi>American</hi>'s forbidding it, publickly admits him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church by the Sacrament of Baptiſm; After having purged him, by demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of him, whether his Deſires herein did proceed from any hopes of temporal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> By what Authority or Law, he could do this to that or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Perſon?</note> as for the obtaining of liberty, or the like? Which the <hi>Negro</hi> utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
declaring that he deſired it only for the Salvation of his Soul. This again
coming to his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Maſters knowledg, as it could not well be kept from him, the <hi>Negro</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his return, was welcomed with his former Chain, wherein he was ſoon after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
on Shipboard, and ſo to <hi>America:</hi> Where 'tis to be preſumed, that according
to the <hi>general cuſtom</hi> there, he ſhall never more hear of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> Three of theſe
Paſſages I had from the Miniſters themſelves, even as the other was told me by the
Gentlewoman, an eminent Clergy-man's Wife in thoſe Parts.</p>
            <p>I have heard alſo of a parcel of <hi>Negro's</hi> brought into <hi>England,</hi> concerning whom an
eſpecial charge was in the firſt place given to the Servants, not to mention any thing
of Religion to them: Together with an intimation, (which was no other, than to
invite ſome lewd fellow to the Villany) how acceptable a piece of ſervice it would
be, to have a certain young <hi>Negro</hi> Wench of the Company got with Child. It ſeems
they take this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fornication to be no ſin, no not ſo much as Venial.</p>
            <p>To theſe I may add, what I have heard, and do believe to be too true, <hi>viz.</hi> That
the Grandees of one of theſe Colonies, were not long ſince ſo hardy, and withal ſo
impious, as to produce<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Articles againſt their Governor Sir <hi>J. H.</hi> for his intended
kindneſs to theſe People upon this account; How far their Complaint was admitted,
I cannot tell. It was certainly an Innovation, and for which he could produce no
Preſident in thoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Parts. So that Mr.<note n="*" place="margin">In his Temple.</note> 
               <hi>Herbert</hi> ſeemeth to have been directed by a
fallible Spirit, when in certain prophetic Lines, foretelling the large and ſpeedy
progreſs of Religion in <hi>America,</hi> he thus ſung,
<q>
                  <l>Religion ſtands a tiptoe in our Land,</l>
                  <l>Ready to paſs to the <hi>American</hi> Strand.</l>
               </q>
And a little further;
<q>
                  <l>Then ſhall Religion to <hi>America</hi> flee,</l>
                  <l>They have their Goſpel-times as well as we.</l>
               </q>
The contrary being here moſt viſible; for inſtead of our carrying <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> thither,
they are upon bringing over the blackeſt <hi>Irreligion</hi> and <hi>Gentiliſm</hi> hither.</p>
            <p>Now if the cauſe of this their ſo great ſpite againſt <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and cruelty to the
Souls of Men, even of their own Slaves, who wear out their days in perpetual toil
and labour for them,<note place="margin">If the <hi>Negro</hi> knew his Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, he need not to deſire Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of his freedom.</note> ſhould be enquired into, it would not be eaſy to give a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
Reſolution. Some indeed here at home, have been ready to form Excuſes for
them, and to urge the danger of looſing their Slave by his admittance to Baptiſm.
But this certainly cannot be the true Cauſe, at leaſt as to thoſe parts. I my ſelf was
accidentally preſent at the ſigning of an Act of Aſſembly by the Governor of <hi>Virginia,</hi>
for the Security of this Intereſt. The like Laws I have been aſſured were enacted in
the reſt of the <hi>Plantations.</hi> And Sir <hi>Robert Southwell,</hi> upon ſome diſcourſe about
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100722:7"/>
this very thing, ſome five Years ſince, was pleaſed to inform me, That he had heard
the late Lord Chancellor <hi>Finch</hi> declare, that he did not know of any Law now in
force in <hi>England,</hi> (or words to that effect) whereby a <hi>Slave</hi> was releaſed from Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
by <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> And certainly he, if any Man, muſt have known it. Others will
tell us, that <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> will make them more crafty and cunning, and withal, more
tumultuous and rebellious. But this Argument equally fights againſt <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in all
other places, and renders it intollerable to all Conditions and Degrees alike, as well
to <hi>Freemen</hi> as <hi>Slaves,</hi> and at Home as well as Abroad; and at this rate it muſt be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
out of the World. Others again are ready to ſuggeſt the Factors of <hi>Jackatra</hi>'s
Reaſon: But what have Slaves to do with buying and ſelling, who have nothing of
their own to diſpoſe of? So that if the Reaſon were good, and of force againſt other
freer <hi>Gentiles,</hi> (not to mention that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ought not, upon any account whatſoever,
to put themſelves into a condition or courſe of Life, which carries with it an inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
neceſſity of perpetual ſinning againſt God); yet it makes nothing againſt our<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Negro-Slaves</hi>
admittance to <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> So that for my part I can deduce this curſed averſion
in our <hi>Planters,</hi> from no other cauſe, than from their brutiſh and <hi>Atheiſtical</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Impii impie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, nec intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. <hi>Dan. 12.</hi>
               </note> temper,
which they are willing to ſhift off and to excuſe with ſuch Pretences, as knowing
how eaſily they will be here ſwallowed.</p>
            <p>To this I might add that filthy Principle, which I think is almoſt univerſally received,
and currant amongſt them, That whatever conduceth to the getting of Mony, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
on of <hi>Trade,</hi> muſt certainly be lawful. As to inſtance in their trapanning and
ſpiriting Men out of <hi>England,</hi> with ſugar Promiſes of large kindneſs to be exhibited
to them at their arrival in thoſe Parts: whilſt at the very inſtant they intend nothing
elſe but to expoſe them to ſale, and to make <hi>Slaves</hi> of them, at leaſt for ſome term
of Years.<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 21. <hi>All ſeek their own,</hi> &amp;c.</note> This, with other the like practices, I have heard juſtified and defended,
and that by Perſons who appeared very honeſt Men for thoſe Places, and that withal
would ſeem to have at leaſt ſome little ſenſe of <hi>Religion</hi> above their Neighbours, (for
a great deal would quite undo them); who yet becauſe they never hear them contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted,
may poſſibly be perſwaded of their lawfulneſs. And by the ſame Principle
I ſuſpect it may be, that even thoſe do permit Polygamy to their Slaves, and alſo put
them upon a neceſſity of labouring upon <hi>Sundays,</hi> to prevent their ſtarving all the
Week after.</p>
            <p>Now all this, muſt in a very great meaſure be aſcribed, to their want of being
at firſt better inſtructed, and their not having the contrary Doctrines often inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to them, as well from the Pulpit as elſewhere. Theſe <hi>Tares were ſown whilſt the
Watchmen ſlept,</hi> or poſſibly when there were none at all; Then they grew up and
got ſtrength, and took deep root, and now it is thought too late to weed them up.
Which notwithſtanding I muſt affirm to be beyond all peradventure their ſtrickeſt
Duty. And the total omiſſion whereof, for I never heard it mentioned, will one
day prove a ſharper <hi>Thorn in their Sides,</hi> than that innocent Paper, which ſome have
by Letters to <hi>England</hi> ſo fiercely complained of. Thereby, as it were, <hi>ſtrengthening
the hands of thoſe wicked Men,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks, and <hi>hardening</hi> them in their <hi>evil
way.</hi> Who inſtead of encouraging, do talk of nothing but the <hi>difficulty</hi>

Courage into others, and not only be contented <hi>to ſuffer, but to die</hi> for the Cauſe of
<hi>Chriſt:</hi> Which this certainly is, if ever there were any ſuch. It is indeed difficult,

danger and miſerable condition of thoſe People (if at leaſt it be thought to be ſuch)
calls for Action to all thoſe who had not rather ſee <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> lie waſt, and ſo many

            <p>Others again will ſuppoſe this Work not to be effected, but by the Countenance
and Encouragement of a <hi>Parliament.</hi> But, God be thanked, the Laws in force, are
all in favour of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi>

of Chriſt may, <hi>without hazard,</hi> either of <hi>Life or Liberty,</hi> preach purſuant to any
Text in the whole <hi>Bible,</hi> without any need of new Laws for his juſtification. But if
a <hi>Parliament</hi> be of ſuch abſolute neceſſity for the carrying on thereof, bleſſed be God
we have one at hand; who doubtleſs, upon a due Application, will not be wanting
to contribute their utmoſt aſſiſtance to ſo religious and good a Work. However, at
the worſt,<note place="margin">Eccl. 32. 15, 17</note> we are in no worſe condition than the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and firſt preachers of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity</hi>
were. And ſhould it happen, which God forbid, that even the whole Civil
Power ſhould <hi>neglect,</hi> or even <hi>prohibit</hi> this preaching, yet I cannot believe that to
be a ſufficient Plea for our Silence. And I muſt no leſs declare my ſelf of a different
Judgment from thoſe who hold the contrary, tho unfurniſh'd with <hi>Miracles;</hi> as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
the Service of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Salvation of Souls, to be of much greater conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
than any worldly Concern can poſſibly be; and being no leſs perſwaded that
neither Secular Intereſt, Reaſon of State, nor any prudential Conſideration whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
can in the leaſt juſtify ſuch a Neglect, or Silence.</p>
            <p>But there are no leſs than four potent Objections againſt this Work ſtill remaining
to be conſidered. As,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That this kindneſs, eſpecially to Slaves, will make them <hi>Hypocrites</hi> only, and
not <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> They will be apt, notwithſtanding the Laws before-mentioned, to run
to <hi>Baptiſm</hi> in hopes of Liberty, having hitherto flattered and hugged themſelves with
ſuch thoughts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It will diſpleaſe the Merchants.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This is only ſome petty Deſign, which I am hereby managing for my
ſelf.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, What I have both formerly and now ſaid herein, is all Lyes; The <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
Men of extraordinary Credit, having ſo declared. A Man would judg that
<hi>Chriſtianity</hi> were grown extraordinary cheap, and of low eſteem with thoſe Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters,
when ſuch groundleſs Slanders, and <hi>blind Shifts,</hi> ſhall be admitted to its preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice;
and its Cauſe quite given up by them upon ſuch <hi>empty</hi> Suggeſtions.</p>
            <p>But, to begin with the laſt. What? is all but Lyes? Is not that true, touching the
<hi>Negro's</hi> not being admitted to <hi>Chriſtianity?</hi> Why then did thoſe very <hi>Planters</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
at leaſt by their <hi>Agents,</hi> both own and defend it, ſome time ſince, before the
Council; And even then giving in their Reaſons, ſuch as they were, for the contrary?
Admit but this one piece of monſtrous Abſurdity, this ſo impudent Impiety, which
is too evident to be denied, and the reſt may, without any great difficulty, be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
at leaſt, it will not be for their credit to put me to prove even the worſt of
them.</p>
            <p>The next to it is of the like force and nature, wherein the Argument thus runs, That
to defeat and ſpite me, <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is not to be promoted, nor the Souls of Men ſaved.
Very <hi>Chriſtianly</hi> both ſpoken and concluded! See here of what different Tempers
theſe Objectors are,<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 15, 18.</note> from that of St. <hi>Paul; Some,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>do indeed preach Chriſt for
Envy and Strife; and ſome alſo of good Will: What then? notwithſtanding every Way, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Pretence or Truth, Chriſt is preached; and therein do I rejoice, yea, and I will rejoice.</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:100722:9"/>
It ſeems, ſo that the Work were done, which he ſo paſſionately purſued and laboured
for, he did not ſo much regard the undue Motives by which Men were induced and
perſwaded to it; which theſe here do wholly ſeem to do.</p>
            <p>For the next; I would fain know what kind of <hi>Merchants</hi> theſe are, who will be
diſpleaſed upon this occaſion? Either we muſt pleaſe, or diſpleaſe them. But
St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us,<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 10.</note> (and I ſuppoſe in this very ſenſe) that if <hi>we pleaſe Men, we cannot
be the Servants of Chriſt.</hi> At this rate, <hi>Elijah</hi> was not to have diſpleaſed <hi>Ahab;</hi> nor
St. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt,<note place="margin">Be not ye the Servants of Men.</note> 
               <hi>Herod;</hi> In the Collect for whoſe day, we are yet taught-to pray,
That <hi>after his Example we may conſtantly ſpeak the Truth, boldly rebuke Vice, and patiently
ſuffer for the Truth's ſake.</hi> So that it is evident, we muſt, as the caſe ſtands, either
diſpleaſe them or act contrary to our Prayers, and diſobey Chriſt. <hi>We are not to pleaſe
our Neighbour,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 2.</note> but <hi>for his good to edification,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, Why ſhould theſe be any more <hi>Hypocrites</hi> than themſelves? ſince that God's
Grace is free,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>St.</hi> Mat. 3.</note> and may be beſtowed upon whom he pleaſeth. He can raiſe <hi>out of thoſe
Stones,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>St.</hi> John 3.</note> 
               <hi>Children unto</hi> Abraham: And his <hi>Spirit bloweth where it liſteth.</hi> Beſides, a very
ſhort ſpace would confute that fooliſh Opinion of their Freedom, when they had
ſeen ſome of their Fellows continued in their former State, even after <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> One
would think, that Men were aſhamed and weary of their Religion, that can admit of
ſuch Flams againſt it.</p>
            <p>But now after that, all their pittiful Reaſonings are vanquiſh'd, and their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
put to flight, yet nevertheleſs it cannot ſtill be other with them, than impra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable;
nor are there wanting ſome that, to ſave trouble, from amongſt our ſelves
are inclined to believe as much. Good God! that <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> after its continuance in
the World for near two thouſand Years, ſhould now at laſt be excluded for its impra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticableneſs.
A <hi>Poſition</hi> which every Man, endued but with common ſence, may at
once ſee as well the wickedneſs as the folly of it. The <hi>Diſputer</hi> that denied Motion,
and was not to be confuted but by practice, (which theſe alſo muſt) was not half
ſo ridiculous.</p>
            <p>But perchance they will ſay, 'tis only impracticable to Slaves. If ſo, why are the
Native <hi>Indians</hi> upon the Continent, who are only Tributaries, and whoſe Habitations
are many of them environ'd by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> equally neglected, and their reduction
to <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> as much ſcofft at as the other? And why were not thoſe poor <hi>Barbarians</hi>
of <hi>Jackatra</hi> (before mentioned) admitted thereto, when ſo earneſtly importuned
and beſought by them? But to anſwer the Objection.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> be impracticable as to the condition of Slavery,
why then did the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> both preach and write, to and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<note n="*" place="margin">For by our Spirit we are all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into one Body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be Bond or Free: and have been all made to drink into one Spirit, <hi>ſaith St.</hi> Paul, <hi>1 Cor. 12. 13.</hi> See al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>Chap. 7. 20, 21, 22,</hi> &amp; 24.

               <hi>Slaves,</hi> either for their Converſion, or Confirmation in
<hi>Chriſtianity?</hi> For either they therein did well, or ill: If well,
then ought we to imitate them therein: But that they did ill, was
never, that we find, once ſuggeſted, no not by the <hi>Heathen</hi> Maſters
themſelves. For thoſe ſtill remaining as much their <hi>Slaves</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
of what wrong could they complain, unleſs of their being
made better and more faithful Servants by <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> than they
were? But if by <hi>Baptiſm</hi> they were ſet at liberty, (which the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> and the expreſs words of their ſeveral Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
do prove that they were not) then it is evident that the
<hi>Apoſtles</hi> did not ſuppoſe the Maſter's Intereſt in his Slave to be of greater account
than the Slave's Salvation: Nor that they ought to value his Diſpleaſure or Profit,
thus ſtanding in competition with their Duty; which is exactly our Caſe. Again, if
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100722:9"/>
thoſe of other Religions do,<note place="margin">See A. B. <hi>Abbot</hi>'s Hiſtory of the New World, where he makes often mention of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Friars</hi> labours in this kind in <hi>America;</hi> A <hi>Prelat</hi> that was never ſuſpected for any friend to them.</note> with great Induſtry and Zeal, both
endeavour and effect, (as it is plain that they do, whilſt ours do
not only neglect, but forbid it); then it is clear that therein thoſe
do act more agreeably to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and Scripture-Rule, than our
ſelves; whom yet we ſo frequently charge in other things of leſs
moment, with deviating from it; And ſo forgetting how we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
our ſelves whilſt we blame them. However ſince theſe do
it, where is then the impracticableneſs thereof? or how comes it to be leſs practicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to us, than to them? If they do it leſs perfectly, as is ſuggeſted, yet ſtill they
do it.<note n="*" place="margin">Si tibi diſpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceant, fac melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, precor. <hi>Mart.</hi> Ep.</note> If amiſs, let us do it better: Only let us not under that pretence be ſaid
never to do it at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If any Man have not the Spirit of Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 9.</note> 
               <hi>he is none of his,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: Now
<hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Spirit was to promote the Salvation of Mankind. But of what Spirit muſt
thoſe then be that do neglect and hinder it?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 22.</note> And <hi>if any Man love not the Lord Jeſus

there be in endeavouring to rob him of that which he ſo dearly purchaſed with his
Blood?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>All Knowledg, all underſtanding of Mysteries,</hi> and <hi>all Faith,</hi> without <hi>this Charity
is nothing;</hi> Yea, the <hi>beſtowing of all our Goods to the relieving of the Poor,</hi> and <hi>even the
giving our Bodies to be burnt, withoat it, will profit us nothing.</hi> This is a thing which
all Sects and Parties do moſt generally agree in: No Scruples to tender Conſciences
will from hence ariſe; it being impoſſible that any ſhould oppoſe it, but ſuch only
who have loſt all Conſcience.</p>
            <p>And certainly, if <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> and the Souls of Men be worth our care, it cannot be
but that ſomething in order thereto will ſpeedily be endeavoured; the thing in its
ſelf being moſt eaſy, and there wanting nothing, but ſome reſolute and wiſe <hi>Agent</hi>
to puſh it forward. As for the impotent railing of thoſe <hi>Barjeſuſes</hi> and <hi>Elymaſes,</hi>
(for God be thanked that is the worſt they can do) it is to be pitied and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
rather than dreaded or regarded by us. Or at the worſt, a vigorous purſuit
would in a ſhort time both diſarm and ſilence them. There being no Strumpet ſo
impudent and void of ſhame, as to aſſert and practice her lewdneſs in the preſence
of more vertuous People. Nor has it been heard that any Thief has been ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
as to defend his Rapines and Slaughters before an upright Judg. And it being
a thing ſo utterly incongruous and contradictory in it ſelf, for Men to call themſelves
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> yea, and of the moſt refined ſort too, and yet at the ſame time to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> that it is impoſſible but at the firſt manful onſet, they muſt needs be
baffled and ſhamed out of it.<note place="margin">Wiſd. 17. 11.</note> For, <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> as the wiſe Man ſaith, <hi>condemned by
her own Witneſs, is very timerous, and being preſſed with Conſcience, always forecaſteth
grievous things.</hi> So that there ſeemeth nothing more to be needful, but the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word
from our vigilant and prudent Leaders, to the faithful Souldiers of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
boldly to fall on, and to attaque them: <hi>The Victory cannot but be eaſy over thoſe that fight
againſt God.</hi> And pitty, yea infinite pitty it would be, that ſo Holy and Righteous a

            <argument>
               <p>The whole Verſe runs thus;
<q>Alſo in thy Skirts is found the Blood of the Souls of the
poor Innocents; I have not found it by ſecret ſearch,
but upon all theſe.</q>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>THis Particle <hi>[Alſo]</hi> ſtanding at our firſt entrance into the
Text, requires us to raiſe our Eye to the foregoing Words,
both of this, and of the former Chapter. In the firſt of
which we find our Prophet, as it were opening his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
aſſerting his Authority as derived to him from God himſelf.
<hi>Before I formed thee in the Belly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 1 ver. 5, 7.</note> 
               <hi>I knew thee; and before thou cameſt
forth out of the Womb, I ſanctified thee, and ordained thee a Prophet unto
the Nations: Therefore thou ſhalt go unto all that I ſhall ſend thee, and
whatſoever I command thee, thou ſhalt ſpeak.</hi> And the better to qualify
and enable him for this great Work,<note place="margin">Verſ. 9.</note> it is added, <hi>Behold, I have put
my words into thy Mouth.</hi> And then to create a Reſolution and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100722:11"/>
in him ſuitable thereto, and that he might go on with a ſteady
boldneſs and aſſurance in this ſo hazardous and thankleſs an Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<note place="margin">Verſ. 18.</note> it is promiſed that he ſhould be <hi>an Iron Pillar,</hi> and <hi>a brazen Wall,</hi>
yea, <hi>a defenced City againſt them;</hi> And that therefore <hi>he was not to be
afraid or diſmayed at their Looks,</hi> (that being the worſt they ſhould be
able to do againſt him,)<note place="margin">Verſ. 19.</note> for that God himſelf <hi>would moſt certainly be
with him, to preſerve and deliver him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In confidence whereof,<note place="margin">Chap. 2. 4.</note> we find him in the next Chapter betaking
himſelf to his Function; and in charity to his own ungodly Nation,
beginning with them firſt, unto whom indeed he was eſpecially ſent:
Where after a brief rehearſal of the many benefits conferred upon
them by God himſelf,<note place="margin">Verſ. 7, 20.</note> as that <hi>he had broken their Yoke, and burſt their
Bonds,</hi> had <hi>brought them into a plentiful Countrey,</hi> which he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
for them, <hi>to eat the fruits thereof, and the goodneſs thereof.</hi> That
he had there <hi>planted them a noble Vine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 21.</note> 
               <hi>wholly a right Seed,</hi> inſtructed
them in the beſt and pureſt Religion; with abundance of the like
Privileges and Immunities, which by his eſpecial Favour and Munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
they enjoyed above all other People; I ſay, after this, the
Prophet at laſt beſpeaks the Almighty as falling thus to expoſtulate
with them:<note place="margin">Verſ. 5.</note> 
               <hi>What Iniquity have your Fathers found in Me, that they are
gone away far from me?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 11.</note> And, <hi>Hath a Nation changed their Gods, which are
yet no Gods? but my People have changed their glory, for that which doth
not profit:</hi> Charging them that they had <hi>turned their Backs to him, had
ſpoken and done evil things with their utmoſt might, and as far as they could<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
Adding,<note place="margin">Hâc tuâ im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudentiâ qua omnes ſuperas, etiam impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſſimos doces improbitatem.</note> 
               <hi>that they were become cruel, and unthankful,</hi> and (which was
worſt of all) <hi>incorrigible;</hi> and in a word, <hi>worſe than the very Heathen.</hi>
That by their cuſtomary and long Practice in that curſed Trade of
Sinning, they had attained a notable aptneſs and dexterity therein,
even beyond the proficiency of the moſt <hi>wicked,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jun.</note> whom, it ſeems, they
were able to <hi>teach.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 33.</note> In fine, they are told that they were <hi>wholly turned
into a degenerate Plant of a ſtrange Vine;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 7.</note> had <hi>defiled the Land which he
had brought them into,</hi> and <hi>made God's Heritage an Abomination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now after this ſo large and foul a Catalogue of their Impieties,
one would have thought that the Prophet muſt have been at a ſtand,
and could have proceeded no further; when to compleat the charge,
and to render them for ever both inexcuſable and infamous, he adds
to it a certain new, and before unheard-of Villany, <hi>viz.</hi> of exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
thoſe their Helliſh Cruelties,<note place="margin">Verſ. 23, 35.</note> not only upon the Bodies, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
them to the very <hi>Souls,</hi> and that of <hi>poor Innocent</hi> Men: Which,
as bad as it is, is yet exceedingly aggravated by their Impudence in
the perpetration, ſhewing that it was grown into a Faſhion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

               </note> not committed in private, or in the
dark, as if aſhamed of it; nor yet detected by any laborious <hi>Search,</hi>
or <hi>Scrutiny,</hi> but acted openly, and in the Face of the Sun, like <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom</hi>
upon the Houſe top; and even owned and juſtified by them to
the whole World: They did, as the Prophet ſpeaks, TRIMM, that
is, by falſe reaſonings and Sophiſtry, and probably ſometimes by the
loudeſt Lies defend and aſſert their Impiety;<note place="margin">Quid bonam praedicas viam tuam? <hi>Vulg. Ed.</hi>
               </note> nor could by any
Argument be perſuaded to acknowledg it to be ſo: But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
boaſted themſelves <hi>Innocent,</hi> proclaimed that they were <hi>not pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Quid niteris bonam oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere viam tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am? <hi>Jun. Why TRIMMEST thou thy way?</hi> verſ. 33.</note> and that <hi>they had not ſinned,</hi> notwithſtanding that <hi>their way in
the Valley,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks, was ſo notorious. They might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
have an Eye unto their <hi>MAMMON,</hi> and belike, deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that the neceſſity and benefit ariſing to them from their Trade
and Commerce with Forreign Nations, would not barely excuſe, but
even conſecrate the Villany.</p>
            <p>This then, in ſhort, was their caſe; God had moſt mercifully and
wonderfully delivered them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and not only ſo, but had
likewiſe brought them into a Land, which, as the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi>
expreſſeth it,<note place="margin">Chap. 10. 6.</note> 
               <hi>he had eſpied for them,</hi> and which was indeed <hi>the Glory
of all Lands;</hi> the entire and full poſſeſſion whereof was given them
upon this ſole Conſideration, and theſe only Terms, <hi>viz.</hi> That they
<hi>ſhould caſt away all their Abominations,</hi> and become Trumpets of God's
Praiſe, and <hi>declare his Glory among the Heathen,</hi> Pſal. 69. no doubt
for the Salvation of their precious Souls. But inſtead thereof, even
from the very time of their firſt <hi>entrance into that Land,</hi> they practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<hi>all their former Abominations,</hi> and that <hi>with both Hands earneſtly;</hi>
and inſtead of declaring,<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 2. ver. 15. 16.</note> they ſtifled and concealed his <hi>Eternal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
forbidding the preaching of it to the Heathen, that they might</hi> [not]
<hi>be ſaved;</hi> and ſo <hi>they pleaſed not God,</hi> and became the <hi>murtherers of
Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which very thing in this Charge doth ſeem to have been their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
and grand Crime, <hi>viz.</hi> Their acting in and connivance at the
moſt open and <hi>prophane effuſion of the Blood of Men's Souls,</hi> and that too
in that very Land which God had given them to a contrary end and
purpoſe: And the not decrying nor diſcountenancing of which
Wickedneſs, by ſuch other of them who poſſibly might be leſs active
in the perpetration, bringing them alſo in as Aſſociates and Partizans
with the reſt, and rendring them thereof equally guilty.</p>
            <p>But here methinks I perceive my ſelf ready to be interrupted, and
told, that this is a forced Interpretation, and cannot be the proper
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100722:12"/>
meaning of the Text, which, ſay they, was intended only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
thoſe <hi>bloody Immolations</hi> of Children, offered without the Gates
in the Valley of <hi>Hinnom</hi> (and ſo as it were in the Skirts or Suburbs of
<hi>Jeruſalem)</hi> unto <hi>Moloch;</hi> the Words, <hi>Innocents,</hi> and <hi>Poor,</hi> manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
implying no leſs.<note place="margin">

               </gap>, deſtitute of Blood, and <hi>Immortal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unto the firſt of which, I anſwer, That the Words in the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
here rendred by <hi>Poor,</hi> and <hi>Innocents,</hi> do not neceſſarily import the
ſame ſignification with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> where Time and Cuſtom have
made <hi>Innocents,</hi> and <hi>Infants</hi> (or little Children) to be almoſt ſyno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
and convertible; and the Adjunct, <hi>Poor,</hi> to repreſent one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
in Mind or Body, as well as Eſtate or Fortune; one that groans
under Oppreſſion or Sickneſs, or ſome other ſuch like Calamity, and
not under bare Poverty only, which is the moſt natural import of
that Adjunct, and under which Children or Infants cannot ſo well be
ſaid to fall; who, as they are not capable either to gather or uſe
<hi>Riches,</hi> ſo neither can they properly be ſaid to be either <hi>rich</hi> or <hi>poor.</hi>
Theſe Sufferers therefore were not <hi>Children,</hi> but <hi>Men;</hi> poſſibly, as
<hi>poor</hi> in Fortune, as <hi>miſerable</hi> in Condition. They were <hi>Pauperes &amp;
Egentes,</hi> as the Vulgar <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Tremelius</hi> do render the Word,
which is wholly omitted in the <hi>Greek;</hi> where they are only called
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (without any mention of their other condition;) ſignifying
<hi>inſontes, Indemnes, damni expertes, plagis intactas,</hi> as well as <hi>Innocentes.</hi>
All which can hardly be underſtood of little <hi>Children:</hi> And therefore
I cannot ſo readily aſſent that our Prophet here intended theſe.</p>

herein happen to be other, (which there is no convincing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
or reaſon to prove) yet I ſhall not in the leaſt ſcruple to follow
the Letter both of the <hi>Original,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Tranſlations,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
our own. But from the Words, as I here find them, ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that there may be and is, at leaſt in ſome ſenſe or other, ſuch
a Sin as this reprehended in the Text, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>ſhedding the Blood,</hi> and
<hi>murthering of Souls.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:100722:12"/>
And upon this <hi>Foundation</hi> it is that I intend to raiſe my enſuing
Diſcourſe; and therein ſhall obſerve this <hi>Method,</hi> and ſhew,</p>
            <p>I. What this Sin is, and wherein it conſiſts.</p>
            <p>II. The ſeveral ways by which it is committed.</p>
            <p>III. What are the common <hi>Inducements</hi> thereto.</p>
            <p>IV. The moſt <hi>horrid Nature</hi> thereof, and how infinitely diſpleaſing
to Almighty God.</p>
            <p>V. The <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Perſons</hi> here eſpecially charged.</p>
            <p>VI. I ſhall enquire what <hi>Relation</hi> this Text may have unto us, and
how far this <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Nation</hi> may be chargeable with this Sin.</p>
            <p>VII. Which being diſpatch'd, and having diſcovered ſome, and thoſe
no ſmall ſpots and ſtains of this Blood upon our <hi>own,</hi> no leſs than upon
<hi>Jeruſalems Skirts</hi> and Garments, <hi>viz.</hi> by our neglecting the Souls of
the poor Heathen in our Plantations, (and even here at home.)
I ſhall from the hainouſneſs of the Sin, and from the Prophet's
ſevere reprehenſion of it in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the ſeventh and laſt place,
infer the moſt <hi>indiſpenſible</hi> and <hi>abſolute</hi> neceſſity of our ſpeedy redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
this <hi>abuſe</hi> and <hi>neglect</hi> of our duty to God, and to our <hi>own,</hi> no leſs
than to our <hi>Peoples Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. FOR the firſt of theſe. I have before ſhewed, that in Scripture
Language, there is a <hi>Blood of Souls;</hi> but then what that Blood is, and
wherein the Crime of ſhedding it doth conſiſt, will need ſome further
Explication. As for the Phraſe, it muſt be ſuppoſed to be an <hi>Hebrew
Idiotiſm,</hi> or a Metaphor taken from the Function and Imployment
which the Blood ſuſtains and exerciſeth in the Body, which <hi>Moſes</hi>
ſaith,<note place="margin">Gen. 9 4.</note> 
               <hi>is the Life thereof.</hi> So that <hi>to ſhed the Blood,</hi> the Crime here
charged, is to <hi>take away the Life,</hi> whether of Soul or Body.</p>
            <p>Now God Almighty being the ſole Life of Man's Soul, the very
<hi>Fountain of living Waters,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 36. 9.</note> and in <hi>whoſe light only ſhe can ſee Light;</hi> the
miſerable deprivation of his Favour can be no leſs than the <hi>ſhedding
of her Blood,</hi> and the taking away the <hi>Life thereof.</hi> It is to ſubject
her to God's Eternal Wrath and Curſe, the <hi>true ſecond Death,</hi> ſpoken
of by St. <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelations;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 20. 6, 14.</note> the ſame alſo which St. <hi>Paul</hi> terms
to be <hi>accurſed from Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 3.</note> and even to be <hi>blotted out of God's Book,</hi>
which <hi>Moſes, Exod. 32.</hi> in that mighty Zeal for his Nation, ſued for.
In ſhort,<note place="margin">verſ. 32.</note> it is the ſum total of whatſoever is deplorable and wretched,
and to be deprecated and avoided by all Mankind.</p>
            <p>Which loſs of God's <hi>Favour,</hi> with the diſmal Conſequences thereof,
is ſolely occaſioned by an ungodly courſe of Life, and by <hi>Infidelity:</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:100722:13"/>
Piety and Vertue, being the ſame to the <hi>Soul,</hi> which good Blood is to
the <hi>Body;</hi> and what the miſchievous <hi>effuſion</hi> thereof is to the latter,
the ſame muſt the <hi>profuſion</hi> of evil manners be to the former: So that
this ſhedding of the <hi>Soul's Blood,</hi> is nothing elſe but a ſpiteful <hi>capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
and detaining of Men under God's Wrath and Diſpleaſure, a
permitting or forcibly compelling them to perſiſt in <hi>Infidelity,</hi> and a
wicked Life, the moſt natural effect thereof, and which is therefore
the firſt Root or Spring of Miſery and <hi>Death</hi> to the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man. From
whence it is that when Almighty God in the <hi>3d, 18th,</hi> and <hi>33d</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> threatens to require the witleſs Offender's <hi>Blood</hi> at the
<hi>Watchman</hi>'s Hand, 'tis plain that thereby was meant, ſuch Sins and
Enormities, which he, through the want of timely notice from the
<hi>Watchman,</hi> had run into. And when <hi>Job (Chap. 16.)</hi> forbad the
<hi>Earth to cover,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 18.</note> or conceal <hi>his Blood;</hi> 'tis underſtood that he then
made his Purgation, as to the foul ſuggeſtions of his Enemies; wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therein that his moſt ſecret and concealed Sins, there ſtiled his
<hi>Blood,</hi> might be laid open to the view of the whole World: ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
would his innocence then appear, at leaſt as to the Crimes, by his
<hi>back-Friends,</hi> ſo unjuſtly charged upon him. So alſo St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation
of himſelf,<note place="margin">Acts 20. 26.</note> as to <hi>his being pure from the Blood of all Men,</hi> is to
be underſtood of his being no way chargeable with their Ignorance
and <hi>Infidelity,</hi> nor with the Conſequences thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> their other
groſſer Impieties;<note place="margin">Verſ 31.</note> as having even <hi>day and night with Tears</hi> warned
them thereof,<note place="margin">Verſ. 20, 27.</note> at no time ſhunning <hi>to declare unto them the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
of God,</hi> nor <hi>keeping back any thing that was profitable for them.</hi> And
ſo much for the Nature of this Sin, and wherein it conſiſts. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
unto the next Particular;</p>
            <p>II. WHICH is to ſhew the ſeveral ways by which this Sin is
committed; and this I intend for a Light or Sea-Mark, by the help
whereof Men may avoid the danger of running upon it: And they
are eſpecially two. Whereof</p>
            <p>The firſt is by publiſhing of <hi>falſe</hi> Doctrine, which by debauching
of Mens Minds and Judgments with evil <hi>Principles,</hi> doth neceſſarily
lead them into <hi>Immorality,</hi> and a <hi>wicked Life,</hi> which, as I have ſhewed,
is the moſt certain <hi>ruine of the Soul.</hi> For if, as our bleſſed Saviour
teſtifies,<note place="margin">St. Joh. 8. 32.</note> 
               <hi>the Truth doth make Men free,</hi> then muſt Falſhood be the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of their Bondage; and if <hi>right Principles</hi> be the only ſure
Guides and Conducters to <hi>Happineſs,</hi> the contrary muſt needs lead
us to <hi>Miſery</hi> and <hi>Ruin.</hi> For he that believes amiſs, will conſequently act
ſo; it being moſt natural for Men to act according as they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100722:13"/>
perſuaded. <hi>Falſe Doctrine</hi> then muſt be confeſſed to be the
Bane and <hi>Poyſon of the Soul.</hi> The Publiſhers and Promoters whereof,
can therefore be no other than its moſt perfect <hi>Betrayers</hi> and <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers.</hi>
For which reaſon doubtleſs it was, that our Lord Chriſt in
his Goſpel commands us <hi>to take heed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">St. Mark 4. 24.</note> both <hi>how,</hi> and <hi>what we hear:</hi>
confirming <hi>Solomon</hi>'s advice,<note place="margin">St. Luke 8. 18.</note> thus warning us, <hi>Ceaſe, my Son, to hear
the Iuſtruction that cauſeth to err from the words of Knowledg,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov 19. 17.</note> as being
ſo deſtructive to the Soul.</p>
            <p>And no leſs, in the ſecond place, may this guilt be contracted by
<hi>prohibiting</hi> and <hi>concealing</hi> the <hi>Truth;</hi> this being a ſacrilegious robbing
the Soul of her neceſſary <hi>Suſtenance,</hi> and is not ſo much a <hi>ſtabbing</hi> or
a <hi>poyſoning,</hi> as a <hi>ſtarving</hi> of her; The knowledg and practice of the
Truth being that alone which can <hi>reconcile</hi> her unto God, and entitle
her to <hi>his</hi> Favour, which is the <hi>Life</hi> thereof. For, as <hi>Syracides</hi> ſaith,
<hi>The Bread of the Needy</hi> (as well the Spiritual as the Temporal) <hi>is
their Life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ecclus. 34. 21.</note> 
               <hi>and he that defraudeth him of it, is a Man of Blood: And
he that taketh away his Neighbours Living, ſlayeth him; and he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraudeth
him of his Hire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 15. 2.</note> 
               <hi>is a Blood-ſhedder:</hi> So likewiſe, <hi>That the Soul
ſhould be without Knowledg, it is not good,</hi> ſaith the wiſe <hi>Solomon.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it is no other but to murther her. And therefore he ſaith again,
<hi>That the Lips of the Wiſe diſperſe Knowledg,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 15. 7.</note> the moſt proper and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Food for <hi>Men's Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was it which Almighty God complained of by his Prophet
<hi>Hoſea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 4. 6.</note> 
               <hi>That his People were deſtroyed for lack of Knowledg;</hi> Inſtruction,
the means thereof, being withholden from them: And likewiſe in
<hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 5. 13.</note> where it is lamented, <hi>That they were gone into Captivity, and
their honourable Men were famiſhed, and their Multitude dried up with
Thirſt, becauſe they had no Knowledg.</hi> This alſo was the ſad condition
of the poor Flock in <hi>Zechariah;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 10. &amp; 11.</note> They fell <hi>into diſtreſs,</hi> becauſe <hi>there
was no Shepherd,</hi> or ſuch only as did not regard <hi>nor pity them;</hi> no not
when they <hi>were ſold and ſlain.</hi> For <hi>thoſe that were cut off, they did not
viſit, they neither ſought out the young,</hi> nor <hi>healed the broken, nor fed
that which was ſtill;</hi> But that <hi>that dieth, let it die,</hi> was all they cared,
ſo they might <hi>but eat the fleſh of the fat;</hi> retain the Oppreſſors Favour,
and ſo thrive and grow rich. Wherefore, to obviate this ſore evil
for the future,<note place="margin">Chap. 3. 15.</note> Almighty God in the Chapter enſuing the Text, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth
to give them Paſtours after his own Heart, which ſhould feed them
with Knowledg and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> the only ſure Preſervatives of the
Soul.</p>
            <p>Nor let any one here think to <hi>ſhift off</hi> this Guilt, by leſſening this
Sin into an <hi>Omiſſion</hi> only (even where it ſo happens, which is ſeldom;)
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100722:14"/>
It being our very great <hi>Crime</hi> to but <hi>omit</hi> what is our ſtricteſt duty

               <note place="margin">Chap 7. v. 25.</note> It was not enough in our bleſſed Saviour's

               <hi>if he hear thee, thou haſt gained thy Brother,</hi> and
thereby ſaved his Soul. This is that perfect love of <hi>God</hi> and of our
<hi>Brother</hi> (or Neighbour) which cannot be ſeparated; and which
whoſoever wanteth, is at once an Enemy both to God and to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<note place="margin">1 Joh chap. 2, 3, 4.</note> For, <hi>he is a Lyar and a Murtherer,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John; He walketh

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Chap. 3.</note> 
               <hi>He abides in Death,</hi> and can <hi>have no hopes
of Eternal Life;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 10. <hi>&amp;</hi> chap. 4. ver. 20</note> withal adding, that ſuch a Perſon <hi>is not of God,</hi> and
<hi>cannot love him, that hates</hi> (or doth not love) <hi>his Brother;</hi> confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Aſſertion with a moſt ſubſtantial Reaſon, demanding, <hi>How
he can love God whom he hath not ſeen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 3 10, 17</note> 
               <hi>who hateth his Brother whom he
hath ſeen?</hi> For whom <hi>he ought to lay down his Life,</hi> but much more to
extend his Charity, and to open <hi>his bowels of Compaſſion</hi> to him, being
in <hi>need,</hi> whether of Spiritual or Temporal Aſſiſtance. So that this
<hi>Omiſſion,</hi> as they term it, which, of a charitable pious Chriſtian,
renders a Man a <hi>Lyar,</hi> a <hi>Murtherer,</hi> and an <hi>Apoſtate, &amp;c.</hi> is but a
<hi>bad Plea,</hi> and very far from an <hi>extenuation</hi> of our Crime.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:100722:14"/>
But then if this love of our Brother by admoniſhing and reproving
him be thus every Man's duty, much more muſt it be of ſuch, who
are peculiarly <hi>ordained</hi> and appointed to that work; as we read the
Watchman in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was, againſt whom it was determined, That
<hi>he ſhould ſurely die,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 33. 8.</note> 
               <hi>if he did not ſpeak to warn the wicked from his way.</hi>
Wherein it is obſervable, that nothing of any Crime actually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by the Watchman is therein mentioned, but only an <hi>Omiſſion</hi>
of his Duty; nor was this Penalty to be inflicted for any treacherous
correſpondence with the Enemy, or for <hi>betraying</hi> his Cauſe or Party,
but only for <hi>holding his peace</hi> in a time of danger. From hence alone
could St. <hi>Paul</hi> acquit his Innocence,<note place="margin">Acts 20.</note> as to <hi>the Blood of all Men,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he had not omitted to declare to the Souls under his charge
<hi>the whole counſel of God,</hi> nor any thing <hi>that was profitable unto them;</hi>
Of which yet his partiality or ſilence muſt have impleaded him deeply
Guilty: For it had been a <hi>concealing of the Truth,</hi> and therefore confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
a ſhedding of their Blood, and a murthering of them. This was
that <hi>Fruit which our Lord Chriſt</hi> acquaints his Diſciples,<note place="margin">St. Joh. 15. 16.</note> that <hi>they were
to go and bring forth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 14.</note> and <hi>that their Fruit might remain;</hi> and which alone
could qualify them for that honourable Title of <hi>his Friends, viz.</hi> by
an induſtrious and active conformity <hi>to all his Commands;</hi> of which,
this we are ſpeaking of, was <hi>none of the leaſt.</hi> And how far thoſe
ſhifts and excuſes, which upon this occaſion are uſually produced,
will avail us at the laſt day,<note place="margin">St. Mat. 25.</note> the ſad doom both of the <hi>ſlothful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi>
and of the <hi>ſleepy Virgins</hi> may ſerve to inform us. And ſo much
for my ſecond Obſervable. I proceed now unto</p>
            <p>III. THE Third, which is to repreſent the moſt uſual and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Inducements to this Sin; And they are four: Whereof</p>
            <p>The firſt is that <hi>root of Bitterneſs,</hi> or ſpirit of Unbelief, attended
with a moſt <hi>violent Spite</hi> or Enmity to Religion inwardly lodg'd in
the Heart; ſuch as is generally obſervable in Atheiſts and <hi>Anti-Religioniſts,</hi>
eſpecially where Religion doth happen to ſute leſs with
their <hi>Secular Intereſts</hi> and Deſigns.<note place="margin">Amos 7. 12.</note> Or elſe, ſuch as was viſible in
<hi>Amaziah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 13.</note> the Idolatrous High-Prieſt of <hi>Bethel,</hi> or in <hi>Elymas</hi> the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer,
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 8.</note> in <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambers,</hi> and divers others;<note place="margin">Acts 18. 17.</note> who poſſibly might
reſiſt the <hi>true,</hi> only for the ſake of their <hi>falſe</hi> Religions. Or, laſtly,
ſuch as are poſſeſſed with a Spirit of <hi>Gallioniſm</hi> and Indifferency <hi>which</hi>
or <hi>what</hi> Religion ſhall prevail; whether <hi>Jeſus</hi> or <hi>Mammon, Barabbas</hi>
or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo that they may be at eaſe, it is the ſame with them. But
againſt whom our bleſſed Lord hath poſitively declared, ſaying, <hi>He
that is not with me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">St. Mat. 12. 30.</note> 
               <hi>is againſt me; and he that gathereth not with me,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100722:15"/>
ſcattereth.</hi> Now the foundation and root of this, is nothing elſe but
<hi>Infidelity;</hi> They act againſt, or neglect Religion, becauſe they <hi>believe</hi>
it not. For, as the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> obſerves, <hi>All people will walk every
man in the name of his God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 4. 5.</note> and of that <hi>Religion</hi> which they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
of. As for inſtance; a <hi>Jew</hi> will make his boaſt of <hi>the Temple
of the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 7. 4.</note> and ſtand up for his antiquated <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> A <hi>Turk</hi> will
aſſert his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and rather than fail will buy over <hi>Proſelytes</hi> to his
Superſtition. And ſome <hi>Chriſtians</hi> there are too, who (to the ſhame
of others who do oppoſe or neglect it) will do the ſame for theirs.
The <hi>Epheſian</hi> Craftſmen would adventure upon an Uproar,<note place="margin">Acts. 19.</note> rather
than ſuffer their <hi>Diana</hi> to be blaſphemed. Yea, the ſilly Worſhippers
of <hi>Baal</hi> could <hi>cry aloud from morning till noon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King. 18. 23.</note> not ſparing their <hi>fleſh
from Knives and Launcers</hi> for the honour of their <hi>paultry</hi> Deity; Nor
would the <hi>Gentiles</hi> change <hi>their Gods,</hi> of whoſe Divinity they were
before perſwaded, as our <hi>Prophet</hi> obſerves. <hi>But theſe,</hi> as ſaith the
ſame <hi>Prophet</hi> Micah,<note place="margin">Chap. 4. 12.</note> 
               <hi>know not the ways of the Lord, nor underſtand his
Counſels:</hi> Yea, they vilify and caſt <hi>Dirt</hi> upon that Religion, they
would be thought to <hi>profeſs.</hi> A moſt evident ſign <hi>that they believe
it not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly; <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Ambition</hi> are too frequently the occaſions of
this Sin. As when in the <hi>Church,</hi> ſome fanciful <hi>Humouriſts,</hi> or ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necked
<hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> ſhall turn <hi>Reformers;</hi> and, upon their own Heads
endeavour to make Alterations in things ſetled and agreed upon by
the <hi>best</hi> Authority, and after the <hi>matureſt</hi> Deliberation. Or when
ſome little <hi>Dwarfs</hi> or <hi>Pygmies</hi> in worth and abilities, ſhall ſet up for
themſelves, and by diſperſing Heterodox <hi>Opinions</hi> in Religion, ſhall
aſpire after <hi>fame</hi> and greatneſs amongſt their Party and Followers.
Or in the <hi>State,</hi> when any diſſatisfied <hi>Achitophel</hi> ſhall plot revenge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it: And to that vile end ſhall ſide with, and encourage the <hi>idle
Dreams</hi> and <hi>Dotages</hi> of thoſe empty <hi>Votaries,</hi> as hoping to compaſs
that by the <hi>new</hi> Religion,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 1 Tim. 6. 3.</note> which he could never effect by the <hi>old. 'Tis
Pride,</hi> ſaith an ancient Greek Proverb, that is the <hi>Parent of Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
the very ſame with that of St. <hi>Paul, If any Man teach otherwiſe,
and conſents not to wholſom words, he is proud, knowing nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third Inducement is <hi>Avarice,</hi> and a never ſatisfied <hi>Thirſt</hi> after
<hi>filthy Lucre:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Wiſd. 15. 12.</note> When wicked <hi>Mammoniſts,</hi> (ſuch who <hi>do account their
Life here to be but a Market for gain,</hi> and that reſolve <hi>they muſt be get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi>
tho it be with the <hi>ruine</hi> of their own, and <hi>their Peoples Souls)</hi>
ſhall begrutch the time and expences laid out upon the <hi>Service</hi> of God,
and the Work of <hi>Religion.</hi> Who finding their <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> to be
inconſiſtent, and having purpoſed in <hi>deſpite</hi> thereof to carry on
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100722:15"/>
their <hi>ungodly</hi> Intereſts, will not ſcruple to turn their Backs to the
one, for the <hi>advantage</hi> of the other, and ſo as much as in them lieth
ſhall make their <hi>God</hi> to truckle under <hi>Mammon.</hi> Or when <hi>Cheats</hi> and
Impoſtors to furniſh themſelves of a <hi>livelyhood,</hi> and finding Preaching
to be the only <hi>Trade</hi> they can ſet up for, without ſerving an Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeſhip,
ſhall ſubvert Order, draw Diſciples after them, and preach
a Nation into <hi>Deſolation.</hi>
               <note place="margin">28. Pet. 2. 3.</note> Such, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> deſcribing, warns us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt,
<note place="margin">Rom. 16. 17, 18.</note> who <hi>through Covetouſneſs, with fained words, ſhould make Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe
of us:</hi> And whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> bids us <hi>to mark and avoid;</hi> for that <hi>they
did not ſerve our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as they falſly pretended, <hi>but their
own Belly;</hi> and <hi>by good Words and fair Speeches did deceive the Hearts of
the ſimple:</hi> But for which, (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the forementioned place,
to their ſmall comfort, aſſures them) <hi>their Judgment did not linger,
nor their Damnation ſlumber.</hi> This is that <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi>
terms <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 3. 5.</note> For whatſoever a Man magnifies and <hi>admires moſt,</hi>
that certainly <hi>must be his God;</hi> And in Chriſtianity, whereſoever
practiſed, 'tis no doubt a renouncing of it: It being no leſs true, than
Truth it ſelf,<note place="margin">St. Mat. 6. 14.</note> 
               <hi>That no Servant can ſerve two Maſters, for either he will
hate the one,</hi>
               <note place="margin">St. Luk. 16. 13.</note> 
               <hi>and love the other, or elſe he will hold to the one, and deſpiſe
the other.</hi> Now to <hi>deſpiſe</hi> and <hi>hate,</hi> what is it but <hi>inwardly</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce?
And therefore, a little to invert our Saviour's Words, I
muſt in this caſe declare, <hi>That we cannot ſerve Chriſt and Trade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt Inducement I ſhall mention is <hi>Sloth,</hi> and a ſupine care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs
and neglect of <hi>Religion,</hi> and of the <hi>Souls of Men:</hi> When to
avoid Clamour and Obloquie, or being willing to ſhift off Buſineſs,
or to flatter a few Atheiſtical Apoſtates;<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 12.</note> (Such I fear, <hi>to make a fair
ſhew in the Fleſh,</hi> would, with St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>prudent</hi> and <hi>moderate Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
ſcarce ſtick at Circumciſion, if thereby they might <hi>eſcape ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perſecution for the Croſs of Chriſt;)</hi> Or becauſe it is a <hi>barren</hi> Theme,
and nothing is to be got by the <hi>preaching</hi> or promoting of it, but may
rather prove ſome impediment to their <hi>Profit:</hi> Or laſtly, becauſe
there is ſome <hi>labour</hi> or trouble in it; I ſay, when for theſe doughty rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
Men ſhall ſuffer <hi>Religion</hi> to lye waſte, and poor <hi>Innocent Souls</hi> to
periſh, without any <hi>pity</hi> or regard; and then to excuſe this their
<hi>Sloth,</hi> or whatever <hi>worſe</hi> Name it deſerves, ſhall declare it a <hi>needleſs
Service:</hi> And ſo ſtrike Hands with the Adverſary, to the great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
and <hi>weakning</hi> of thoſe who are more hearty therein;
whom they <hi>ought in Duty</hi> to both ſtrengthen and aſſiſt. And ſo I
proceed to</p>
            <p>IV. THE Fourth Obſervable, which is to ſhew the <hi>horrid</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100722:16"/>
moſt unpardonable <hi>Nature</hi> of this Sin, and how infinitely diſpleaſing
to Almighty God. Which will be made appear from theſe <hi>five</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Circumſtances, whereof,</p>
            <p>The firſt is its evil and <hi>lewd Society,</hi> and that foul <hi>herd</hi> of Sins,
which it is muſtered and mated with, in this and the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
For even <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Sins,</hi> as well as <hi>Men,</hi> may be judged of
by the <hi>company</hi> they go in.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It will appear from the <hi>Site</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> in which it is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
as being made to cloſe up this grand Charge, brought in in the
laſt place, which in ſuch caſes is uſually the <hi>Principal,</hi> as being apt more

the <hi>like</hi> hainouſneſs into the <hi>whole</hi> Accuſation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By conſidering the <hi>Vehemency</hi> here uſed by our Prophet,
or rather by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> both in and preparatory to this grand
Charge; Whereas at the <hi>12th Verſe,</hi> he breaks forth into this mighty
Exclamation;<note place="margin">Verſ. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Be aſtoniſhed, O Heavens, and be horribly afraid, yea, be
very deſolate,</hi> as it were at the conſideration of this <hi>new and ſtrange</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety:
<note place="margin">Verſ. 22.</note> And at the <hi>22d Verſe</hi> it is reſolved, that <hi>tho they ſhould waſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with Nitre, and take to them much Soap,</hi> yet <hi>that it ſhould not avail
them,</hi> as to any expiation; <hi>For that their Iniquity was marked before the
Lord.</hi> The Conjunctive, <hi>Alſo,</hi> carrying with it a fearful Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, from the clamorous and <hi>revengeful</hi> nature of <hi>Blood</hi> above
all other things, and from the high deteſtation wherewith the Holy-Spirit
of God in <hi>Scripture</hi> hath declared againſt that Sin, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<hi>ſimply</hi> againſt the <hi>Body</hi> alone, without any reſpect or <hi>relation</hi>
to the <hi>Soul.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 21.</note> As when in the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law we read of an <hi>eſpecial Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and Sacrifice</hi> appointed for the expiation of but an <hi>uncertain mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> And of <hi>Abel's Blood crying from the Earth for vengeance againſt
Cain;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 6. 10.</note> and ſo of <hi>the Souls under the Altar crying aloud unto God to judg
and avenge their Blood upon thoſe that dwelt upon the Earth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 21.</note> And of the
<hi>Gibeonites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 21.</note> and <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Blood,<note place="margin">2 King. 9.</note> purſuing <hi>Saul</hi>'s and <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Families,
when themſelves were extinguiſh'd, even to the utter extermination of
<hi>the latter.</hi> And, laſtly, of God's determining to <hi>avenge</hi> even that
Blood, <hi>viz. The Blood of Jezreel, upon the Houſe of Jehu,</hi> tho comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to do it.<note place="margin">Hoſ. 1. 4.</note> From all which Inſtances we may eaſily conclude
the horridneſs of this Sin; Of which nevertheleſs I ſhall yet ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more in <hi>another</hi> place. But,</p>
            <p>The fifth Circumſtance will yet more abundantly make appear the
<hi>horridneſs</hi> of this Sin above <hi>all</hi> other, from the conſideration
of the <hi>nature</hi> and excellency of the <hi>Soul of Man,</hi> which as much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100722:16"/>
his Body, as a living Creature is preferrable to ſo much inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Clay.<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9. 4.</note> The vaſt diſtance between which, <hi>Solomon,</hi> the ableſt
Judg, will beſt inform us, when he pronounceth, <hi>A living Dog to be
better than a dead Lion.</hi> And ſurely then a living and immortal <hi>Soul,</hi>
capable of <hi>Eternal</hi> things, and deſtined to the higheſt Happineſs,
muſt be allowed a proportionable ſhare of preeminence, above a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
and dying <hi>Carcaſe.</hi> Hence it is that our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi>
doth ſo much poſtpone the <hi>danger</hi> of the Body to that of the <hi>Soul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">St. Mark 8. 36.</note>
preferring this laſt <hi>above the World.</hi> Now Offences do uſually receive
much of their aggravation from the <hi>worth</hi> and quality of the <hi>parties</hi>
injured; as our Laws for <hi>Treaſon,</hi> and defaming of <hi>Noble-Men</hi>
do manifeſtly prove. I conclude therefore, that all Injuries and
Wrongs done againſt the <hi>Soul</hi> muſt from the <hi>ſupereminent</hi> and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent
<hi>excellency</hi> of her Nature, take their <hi>trueſt</hi> eſtimate and value,
as to the <hi>Actors</hi> both Guilt and Puniſhment for the ſame, whether
inflicted in <hi>this,</hi> or in <hi>the Life to come.</hi> And as upon a <hi>juſt</hi> ballancing
of the merits of <hi>each,</hi> ſuch Offences will be found infinitely to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh
all other, ſo they do ſeem to <hi>require</hi> an equal proportion of
<hi>Evil</hi> for them. And, to ſpeak in the Scripture Language, if the one
deſerves to be <hi>avenged ſeven-fold truly</hi> the other not ſo little as <hi>ſeventy
and ſeven fold.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>V. NOW for the <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Perſons</hi> here charged, which is the fifth
particular to be conſidered; the Place is <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Perſons
her <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Rulers,</hi> or elſe together with them the Body of her
<hi>People</hi> alſo. Theſe by their <hi>Ignorance</hi> and groſſer <hi>Stupidity,</hi> or by
<hi>wicked</hi> Principles inſtilled into them; and the other by their <hi>Connivance</hi>
and Example, or by their Precepts to the contrary; ſuch as we read
were afterward decreed by <hi>Antiochus</hi> and other Heathen Princes.
But be the fault where it will, whether in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
or in her <hi>People,</hi> or in both; 'tis certain from our <hi>Prophet</hi>'s
Charge, that this at this time was moſt <hi>eminently</hi> the Sin of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
A place where Knowledg did ſo abound, that was ſo thorowly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with <hi>the Will of God,</hi> at leaſt in this particular; that had
had ſo many <hi>Prophets</hi> to inſtruct her, and for a long time had lived
under ſo much <hi>excellent</hi> Preaching;<note place="margin">Iſa. 28. 10.</note> had had <hi>Precept upon Precept,</hi> and
<hi>Line upon Line;</hi> were God's peculiar People, and did glory ſo much
in her alone profeſſion of the Truth, and her being (which was but
true) the beſt <hi>Reformed</hi> Church in the whole World: And laſtly,
that had been gratified and obliged by ſo many <hi>Bleſſings,</hi> ſuch a Train
of <hi>Deliverances,</hi> and no leſs admoniſh'd by as many <hi>ſevere Judgments</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:100722:17"/>
from Heaven: That ſhe ſhould become guilty of the <hi>ſtifling</hi> and <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi>
of Religion, at leaſt by her connivance and permiſſion, and
thereby of the <hi>murthering of Souls;</hi> and that with that daring <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
till her Sins, this eſpecially, became ſo conſpicuous, that there
was no need <hi>of ſearch;</hi> and yet at the ſame time, with ſuch a ſtiff Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
could ſo boldly affirm that <hi>ſhe was Innocent,</hi> and <hi>had not ſinned:</hi>
Theſe, I ſay, were Sins of ſuch a Sanguine Complexion, and ſuch a
Scarlet Dye, that the Almighty begins to look upon himſelf as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to <hi>vindicate his Honour</hi> by a ſevere caſtigation of her, leſt
otherwiſe the very Heathen ſhould aſſume the boldneſs to demand,
<hi>Where was now their God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 42. 3.</note> and the Reformation they ſo much boaſted of?
And hereupon he reſolves to <hi>be unto them as a Lion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. 13 7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>and to obſerve them
as a Leopard in the Way:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Amos 9 8.</hi> &amp; 6. 8. &amp; 5. 16. &amp; 7. 9. &amp; 6. 9, 11.</note> 
               <hi>To meet them as a Bear bereaved, and to rent
the very Caul of their Heart, and to devour them.</hi> And he purpoſeth <hi>to
deſtroy the ſinful Kingdom, and to deliver up the City, and to cauſe wail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be in every Street; and they ſhall go into Captivity with the firſt that
go Captive; and he determines to lay waſte the Sanctuaries of Iſrael, and
to make deſolate the high places of Iſaac. To ſmite the greater Houſes
with Breaches, and the little with Clefts, ſo that if ten Men ſhould remain
in them, they ſhould die.</hi> This was the <hi>Place,</hi> and theſe the <hi>Perſons</hi>
upon whom this <hi>Blood</hi> was charged; and theſe the <hi>Plagues</hi> allotted
for it, as to their <hi>coſt</hi> they afterwards felt.</p>
            <p>VI. BUT here in the ſixth place, methinks, I eſpy ſome one
ready to ſtand up and to demand of me, To what purpoſe is all this
ſtirr, this fierce declaiming againſt <hi>the Murtherers of Souls?</hi> Where
are the <hi>guilty Parties</hi> amongſt us? If the Jews in <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s time or
ſince, have defiled their <hi>Skirts</hi> with this precious <hi>Blood,</hi> what is that
to us, who never were concerned with them therein? Let them look
to it,<note place="margin">Nihil eſt in te, aut circa te, non comma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatem ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine; omnia teſtificantur adverſus te, <hi>&amp;c. Jun. An.</hi>
               </note> we for our Parts are clear. But, <hi>Nos utinam vani!</hi> would to
God my complaint were groundleſs, and that this Guilt had for ever
ſtuck to thoſe firſt <hi>Skirts</hi> only of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church and Nation! For
whether we take theſe <hi>[Skirts]</hi> as a <hi>Metonymie</hi> of a part for the
whole (which ſome do ſeem to favour,) and ſo to imply them all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
and even throughout polluted: Or if with the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
we refer them to the <hi>Hands,</hi> which amounts to almoſt
the ſame with the former: Or if, in the third place, we take them
in a more reſtrained Senſe, and thereby ſhall underſtand the <hi>out-borders</hi>
only, and <hi>Confines</hi> of their Government, (the <hi>Skirts</hi> being the utmoſt
and <hi>extreameſt parts</hi> of a Garment:) In all theſe Sences the <hi>Text</hi> will
be applicable, and the Crime chargeable upon us alſo, no leſs than
upon <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:100722:17"/>
For to underſtand the Word in the <hi>firſt Senſe,</hi> it were eaſy to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiate
into too many <hi>Inſtances,</hi> which will make good that <hi>Senſe</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us. As in the many <hi>large Pariſhes,</hi> and the ſlender (or no) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
found in the greateſt <hi>part;</hi> The ſmall <hi>care</hi> that is taken for the
inſtructing of <hi>Youth,</hi> and the more ignorant both at home and abroad:
The grand Licenſe allowed to the diſperſers of whatſoever falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
the Enemy of <hi>Goodneſs</hi> ſhall inſpire his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and Diſciples
with. And laſtly, in the <hi>open</hi> venting and defending of <hi>Blaſphemy</hi>
and Atheiſm, without any hazard to the Blaſphemer's Perſon or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation:
All which, as they are in ſome ſort near univerſal, ſo they
have a moſt direct and immediate tendency to <hi>the murthering of
Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet not ſo much to <hi>inſiſt</hi> upon theſe, I ſhall inſtance in another,
more <hi>ſuitable</hi> to my purpoſe, and to the <hi>Subject</hi> in hand; and which,
the wholly <hi>unknown</hi> to the <hi>former Ages</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> is now become
frequent in this City and Kingdom: And that is, the <hi>compelling</hi> of
Perſons imported out of <hi>Africa,</hi> and other remoter <hi>Heathen</hi> Regions,
but reſiding in our Families, and Vaſſals to us, to remain in their <hi>native</hi>
Gentiliſm; without any regard to the <hi>honour</hi> of our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
any more than to the good of <hi>their,</hi> or our <hi>own Souls.</hi> An Impiety
that even here ſome <hi>fifty</hi> or <hi>ſixty</hi> years ſince (and at this day in <hi>other</hi>
Countries) would render the <hi>Authors</hi> obnoxious, not only to the
<hi>publick Cenſure,</hi> but to the <hi>Peoples Fury.</hi> But with us, even amidſt
this <hi>mighty Zeal,</hi> and <hi>ſtirr</hi> for <hi>Religion</hi> (an evident ſign that we indeed
have none) is ſuffered to paſs on <hi>without</hi> contradiction. No one
once daring to <hi>open his Mouth</hi> againſt it, or ſo much as to <hi>look</hi> the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety</hi>
in the <hi>Face:</hi>

Enemies have the confidence and courage <hi>openly</hi> to bid <hi>deſiance</hi> to it,
by this their hindring and oppoſing of it.</p>
            <p>But I rather chooſe to take the Word in the more contracted
Senſe, and ſo to underſtand by theſe <hi>Skirts,</hi> the remoter parts only,
ſome <hi>out-Provinces</hi> of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Government. And then this <hi>Text</hi>
will ſeem not only an Hiſtory or Narrative of this <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Impiety, but
alſo a <hi>Prophecy</hi> of our times, too plainly and eminently by our People
acted and fulfilled in our <hi>Plantations.</hi> Where you ſhall ſee this
<hi>Blood of poor Innocent Souls</hi> waſted and <hi>poured out like ſo much Water
ſpilt upon the Ground;</hi> and that Sin, which <hi>at home</hi> ſeems to be as it
were lock'd up under the <hi>darkeſt</hi> Cyphers, and here attains only the
notice of a <hi>few,</hi> is there legible in <hi>Capital</hi> Letters, made evident to
the moſt incurious <hi>Obſerver,</hi> and entred into their very <hi>Laws</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords.
Thereby ſtriving to out-do the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Impudence, <hi>I have not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100722:18"/>
found it by ſecret ſearch,</hi> as being ſo publick and notorious to the
whole World.<note place="margin">Jer. 6. 15.</note> They <hi>are not aſhamed at the committing theſe Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
nay, they are not aſhamed, neither can they bluſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, there you ſhall ſee <hi>Myriads</hi> of poor hungry <hi>Souls</hi> imploring
the <hi>Bread of Life,</hi> but no compaſſionate Chriſtian affording it to them;
Whole Multitudes of St. <hi>Paul's Macedonians</hi> calling for our <hi>help,</hi>

finding none: Not ſo much as that Hypocritical Charity of, <hi>Be ye

and waſting them with unmerciful Labour and wretched <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage,</hi> they
bring into <hi>final</hi> Deſtruction and Bondage their <hi>very Souls</hi> alſo. And
here, before I can proceed a ſtep further, I muſt be ſo bold as to
demand of whomſever ſhall pleaſe to reſolve me, whether the <hi>Jews</hi>
offering up a <hi>few</hi> Children to <hi>Moloch</hi> (which ſome will have this
Text to reprove) the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Superſtitions, (againſt which ſo many
Volumns have been wrote;) the old Gentiles Idolatry, or even the
<hi>Turks</hi> worſhipping <hi>Mahomet</hi> (all Circumſtances conſidered;) be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
to this Sin, among us, <hi>viz.</hi> of continually ſacrificing ſo many
Bodies to <hi>Mammon,</hi> and Souls to the <hi>Devil;</hi> againſt which no one
hath hardly ever yet opened his Mouth.</p>
            <p>And thus I think it doth but too plainly appear, that theſe <hi>Skirts</hi>
are not ſo much ſpotted or ſtained only, as thorowly wrenched
and dyed in this <hi>precious Blood of Souls.</hi> And thoſe our out-Provinces
are moſt evidently chargeable with this moſt foul and horrid <hi>Guilt;</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:100722:19"/>
far, I dare affirm, beyond whatever hath by Fame been ſtoried to
have been practiſed, or but permitted by any, beſides (yea hardly by)
the moſt openly avowed <hi>Enemies</hi> of Chriſtianity. And, which is yet
more aſtoniſhing, All this and much more, we find to be tolerated
and acted under <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> and by perſons outwardly profeſſors of
it, and that in the <hi>moſt refined and pureſt way.</hi> So ſtrange a mockery
and abuſe, as by no Hypocriſy to be parallel'd, but by the <hi>Jews</hi> crying,
<hi>Hail King</hi> unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Mat. 27. 29.</note> when they were going to <hi>crucify</hi> him; or by
thoſe who murthered their <hi>Sovereign</hi> to make him more <hi>glorious</hi> and
renowned! They might doubtleſs more innocently, give licenſe and
freedom for the erecting publick <hi>Stews,</hi> and Brothel Houſes, or make
Proclamation againſt <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>common Honeſty,</hi> than thus to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
or but permit, ſuch <hi>Sacriledg</hi> and Prophaneneſs to paſs without
<hi>Controul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whilſt thoſe abroad are thus acting and carrying on their
Butcheries upon the Souls of Men there, how quietly and unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
in the mean time do we ſit down here, and take our eaſe, not once
in our thoughts reflecting upon this Calamity; <hi>Perinde quaſi, cum
membra noſtra putreſcant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Chryſ.</note> 
               <hi>nihil grave acciderat</hi> as a certain Father
ſpeaks: As tho, like <hi>Cain,</hi> we eſteemed all regard of our <hi>Brethren</hi> to be
needleſs; or like the vile Oppreſſors in <hi>Nathan</hi>'s Parable, we had no
<hi>Bowels</hi> nor <hi>Compaſſion;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 6.</note> or that we believed the rotting and periſhing
of our <hi>Fellow-Members,</hi> to be a moſt deſirable and pleaſant Object.
Yea, we act as tho the Prophet had miſtook, and talked impertinently,
when he demanded,<note place="margin">Mal. 2. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Have we not all one father, and did not one God
create us?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 31. 15.</note> And alſo <hi>Job,</hi> when he asked, <hi>Did not he that made me in
the Womb make them,</hi> and <hi>did not one faſhion us both in the Womb?</hi> And
even <hi>Solomon</hi> too, as wiſe as he was, (or whoever was the Author of
that Book,)<note place="margin">Wiſ. 7. 5, 6.</note> declaring that <hi>no King had other beginning of Birth,</hi> than
what theſe have, <hi>all Men having but one entrance into Life, and the

when he beſpeaks us all,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 5.</note> 
               <hi>as Members one of another.</hi>

            <p>And tho in the Captives of <hi>Algier</hi>'s caſe, as in the late <hi>Brief</hi> it is

               </note> termed <hi>Tyranny</hi> and

and is therein declared a <hi>Calamity never ſufficiently to be bewailed;</hi> yet
the very ſame, or worſe, is allowed in our own People; that is, by
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100722:19"/>
Proteſtants and Engliſh-men: Our profound <hi>Silence</hi> being no better
than a conſtructive approbation; and our <hi>Connivance</hi> a conſenting
thereunto. As if ſuch <hi>Tyranny</hi> over the <hi>Souls</hi> of Men were <hi>Accurſed</hi>
and <hi>never ſufficiently to be bewailed,</hi> only in <hi>Turks</hi> and profeſſed Infidels;
or that the ſame Action were <hi>Vertue</hi> in us, but <hi>accurſed Tyranny</hi> in the
other. Notwithſtanding that thoſe do therein act moſt agreeable to
their <hi>Belief,</hi> and for the <hi>promoting</hi> of their <hi>Faith;</hi> which if true, as
they ſuppoſe it is, is a pious deed, and but what they were bound to
do. And they are therefore beyond all peradventure more <hi>juſtifiable</hi>
before <hi>God,</hi> than ſuch, who whilſt <hi>owning</hi> (I dare not ſay <hi>believing)</hi>
the Truth, do yet upon pretence of <hi>Intereſt</hi> (which <hi>thoſe</hi> do therein
renounce) not only <hi>conceal,</hi> but moſt induſtriouſly <hi>decry</hi> and oppoſe
the advancement of it: Yea, and than ſuch other too, who, tho
they do not <hi>oppoſe</hi> it, yet have never entered their <hi>Proteſts</hi> againſt
thoſe that do. And of both which I cannot ſo much as doubt, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
our <hi>accurſing</hi> the other,<note place="margin">S. Mat. 23 14.</note> but that <hi>theſe ſhall receive the
greater Damnation.</hi> And certainly, (all being impartially weighed)
theſe <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> as bad as they are, for any thing we can find, do
(herein at leaſt) appear more vertuous than our ſelves, and muſt in
the laſt day <hi>riſe in judgment and condemn us;</hi> and that from no other
than our <hi>own Mouths.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 12. 41.</note> For, if they be accurſed for promoting what
they think is the <hi>Truth,</hi> what muſt thoſe be that do oppoſe, (or at

For tho they live in an unpardonable <hi>Errour,</hi> yet becauſe they do it
<hi>Ignorantly thro unbelief,</hi> not <hi>knowing</hi> it to be either <hi>Sin</hi> or Errour, but
perſwaded of the contrary, they are certainly the more excuſable.
And it were an unreaſonable <hi>incongruity</hi> to imagine that the <hi>God of
Mercy</hi> and Juſtice, ſhould be more ready to puniſh <hi>Errours</hi> of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
than <hi>wilful</hi> Impieties: But that, if <hi>thoſe that have ſinned
without Law, ſhall alſo periſh without Law;</hi> much more thoſe that <hi>have
ſinned in the Law,</hi> (that is, againſt their Profeſſion,) <hi>ſhall be judged by it;</hi>
as St. <hi>Paul</hi> argues. And as the Wiſeman ſpeaks, <hi>that the moſt mighty
Sinners ſhould be mightily tormented;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Wiſ. 6. 6.</note> whilſt Mercy may ſooner acquit
the other. For, (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> go's on,) <hi>When the Gentiles which have not
the Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 14.</note> 
               <hi>do by Nature the things contained in the Law; Theſe having not
the Law, are a Law unto themſelves, which ſhew the works of the Law
written in their Hearts; their Conſcience alſo bearing witneſs, and their
Thoughts between themſelves, accuſing or excuſing one another.</hi> And now
this being conſidered, what right can we have thus fiercely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
againſt theſe <hi>Mahometans?</hi> concerning whom, were St. <hi>Paul</hi>
alive to determine the matter; (if but for their <hi>Zeal</hi> for their

               <hi>Religion,</hi> even <hi>falſe</hi> as it is,) in reſpect of our ſelves, he, no doubt
would pronounce them Saints.</p>
            <p>So that to bring down this <hi>Text</hi> to Chriſtianity and our <hi>own</hi> times,
we are the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> therein charged, and in our <hi>Skirts</hi> alſo is this
<hi>Blood</hi> moſt eminently diſcernable.<note place="margin">Pſal. 9. 12.</note> And when God <hi>ſhall ariſe to make

               <hi>the Sword came,</hi> and <hi>we have not blown
the Trumpet, nor warned the People,</hi> and therefore their <hi>Blood muſt be
upon our Heads.</hi> And then it muſt needs go hard with us, and that
chiefly upon the ſcore of that abundant <hi>Light</hi> and Knowledg, and
that <hi>Purity</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> we ſo much boaſt in.<note place="margin">Salv. de gub. Dei.</note> For, <hi>Atrocius ſub ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomine

            <p>VII. THE ſeventh and laſt part of my Diſcourſe, wherein I am

            <p>The Firſt,<note place="margin">Wiſ. 11. 26.</note> which is the <hi>Impiety</hi> thereof: It being an Injury againſt

Happineſs by Chriſt, we, as much as in us lieth, do hereby make
<hi>void</hi> and fruſtrate, and do even <hi>defeat</hi> that his bleſſed <hi>purpoſe,</hi> for

and Natives there, with other <hi>like Gentiles,</hi> who might arrive
thither from other parts.</p>
            <p>It is a moſt <hi>vile Affront</hi> to Chriſtianity, as implying the <hi>no eſteem</hi> we
have for it, as if not worth the troubling the World therewith;
which diſeſteem muſt firſt ariſe from a Principle of Infidelity and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm
firſt lodged in the Heart, as is before ſhewed. It was the
Barbarians of <hi>Japan</hi>'s Argument, in behalf of our <hi>trading</hi> Neighbours
<hi>(whoſe Zeal alſo to Religion doth not much out-ſtrip ours)</hi> that, according
to their Word, they took them to be <hi>no Chriſtians,</hi> becauſe they
perceived not in them any <hi>endeavours</hi> for the promoting of that Faith.
An Indifferency, they obſerved, not uſual with <hi>other ſorts</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;
and it being no way probable, they thought, that Men ſhould
ſo much neglect and <hi>ſlight</hi> a Religion, which themſelves believed.
It makes Chriſtianity <hi>inferiour</hi> to all other Sects, whoſe <hi>Zealots</hi> (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially)
are known, even <hi>to compaſs Sea and Land to make Proſelites</hi>
to their Opinions. It makes it a Religion only for <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,</hi>
and even Heaven and Salvation to be of leſs moment than <hi>the
getting of Money:</hi> It makes it a Patroneſs of the <hi>groſſeſt</hi> Immanities,
for <hi>filthy Lucre;</hi> and no leſs implies an <hi>Impoſture</hi> in the firſt publiſhers
of it, (or at beſt ſome <hi>miſtake</hi> of their <hi>Errand,)</hi> if whilſt they perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Men to <hi>forſake</hi> the World for the <hi>attaining</hi> of Heaven, they only
<hi>deſigned</hi> the heaping up of <hi>Riches,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 S. Joh. 4.</note> as of the greater Importance. It alſo
deſtroys <hi>Charity,</hi> which is the true <hi>mark</hi> of a Child of God, and the
<hi>badge</hi> of a Chriſtian, whoſe proper nature and quality is, tho to <hi>begin</hi>
at home, yet to enlarge it ſelf to others, even our very Enemies.
And in a word, it is no other than an abſolute <hi>depoſing</hi> and rejecting
of <hi>Chriſt, for the Exaltation</hi> of <hi>Mammon.</hi>

Laſtly, It is a <hi>reproach</hi> to <hi>Humanity</hi> it ſelf, and a Sin of the <hi>blackeſt
quality</hi> againſt our Neighbour; whom we herein are ſo far from
<hi>loving as our ſelves,</hi> that it rather ſeems the utmoſt effort of our
Malice againſt him, and which no Revenge could <hi>ſatisfy,</hi> but ſuch
only as ſhould terminate <hi>in the deſtruction</hi> of his <hi>Soul.</hi> And ſo much
for the firſt. But then,</p>
            <p>Secondly, This ought to be reformed in reſpect of the <hi>Diſhonour</hi>
from thence redounding to our <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Nation,</hi> and even to the
<hi>whole</hi> Reformation. Firſt, to the <hi>Church:</hi> For it occaſions her <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies

another it is objected againſt both <hi>our ſelves,</hi> and our equally <hi>zealous</hi>
Neighbours, <hi>That never any thing for the propagation of Chriſtianity in

thence, a third Perſon very roundly infers the <hi>Nullity</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Again, when the great Induſtry of our People in <hi>New-England</hi> ſhall

<hi>ſecular</hi> Affections, as applying our care more to the promoting of

Souls:</hi> The <hi>Poverty</hi> of the Cauſe, that is, ſay they, the want of <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities</hi>
and <hi>Preferments</hi> (tho it be the way to make them), occaſioning
it <hi>hitherto</hi> to lie fallow. And they are too apt often to throw out

may juſtly ſtirr up ſhame in us: Whoſe aſſaulting their <hi>Slaves,</hi>
with tenders of <hi>Liberty,</hi> thereby to induce them to eſpouſe their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,
is by us complained of; perhaps for the <hi>example,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the like <hi>Generoſity</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi> for Religion is not found among our
ſelves; nor are we capable of being <hi>provoked to the leaſt Emulation.</hi>
Thus even <hi>the Sea-Monſters draw out,</hi> (that is, do willingly offer) <hi>the
Breaſt, and give ſuck to their young Ones,</hi> ſaid Almighty God by our
Prophet, <hi>But the Daughter of my People is become cruel, like the Oſtriches
in the Wilderneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor doth the Diſhonour hereof reflect upon this <hi>Church</hi> only, but
upon the <hi>whole</hi> Reformation. Hence the forementioned Roman Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor

               <hi>If you caſt your thoughts upon all Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,

Hence alſo they ſtick not to affirm our Reformation <hi>monſtrous,</hi>

its ſhort-livedneſs; becauſe that things by <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> deſigned
to perpetuity, are always endued with a <hi>Faculty</hi> of Generation, and
of creating their like. So that our Proteſtant Churches do from all
Hands lie under moſt <hi>heavy</hi> Cenſures and Reproaches, for this neglect,
and (as it is repreſented) unfaithfulneſs to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> at leaſt for not
endeavouring, not what <hi>ſhould,</hi> but what <hi>might</hi> be done. And yet,
to our honour be it ſpoken, we undergo them with as much Patience
and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconcernedneſs</hi> as if the Enemy only were chargeable therewith,
and our ſelves were <hi>Innocent.</hi> Altho, to uſe our Prophets Words,

and Myriads, who do even invite, and offer themſelves to his
Service? That we ſhould be ſo much <hi>out-done</hi> who <hi>formerly</hi>
did ſo infinitely out-doe <hi>all others?</hi> Theſe, if true, are I fear, but too
<hi>evident Symptoms</hi> of a ſtrange degeneracy, of a declining old Age and
<hi>Decrepitneſs</hi> in us; and which cannot be far removed from our laſt
<hi>fatal</hi> Period, and <hi>final</hi> Diſſolution; and that God is determining
of us,<note place="margin">S. Luk. 13. 7.</note> as he once did of the <hi>Barren Fig-tree, Cut it down, why cumbers
it the Ground.</hi> And this leads me to</p>
            <p>The third and laſt Motive to this <hi>Reformation, viz.</hi> The dread of
thoſe <hi>Plagues</hi> and <hi>Judgments,</hi> which this Impiety, if longer perſiſted in,
muſt neceſſarily draw down upon us. In the firſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
Act for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity,</hi> there is extent a certain Clauſe containing an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration,
in God's Name earneſtly requiring the due and true execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof, as they ſhould anſwer to Almighty God for ſuch Evils
and Plagues wherewith he might juſtly puniſh the neglect of it. So
that it ſeems in <hi>thoſe</hi> Days, there was ſome apprehenſion of Plagues
and Judgments to follow Impiety and the neglect of Religion. Nay,
long before that, the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarch <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> was not wholly
inſenſible of the ſame, when he iſſued forth that ſtrict Decree for
the ſpeedy re-edifying of the Temple, fortified with this Reaſon,
<hi>For why ſhould there be wrath upon the Realm of the King,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezr. 7 23.</note> 
               <hi>and of his Sons?</hi>
'Tis true, ſome Apoſtate <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> before their Captivity, (to ſave
themſelves the labour of <hi>reforming</hi> their Lives), we read, had fallen
into a moſt <hi>abominable</hi> practice of ſcoffing at, and <hi>denying Providence,</hi>
affirming,<note place="margin">Ezek. 8. 12. <hi>&amp; 9. 9.</hi>
               </note> That the <hi>Lord had forſaken the Earth;</hi> or, tho he had not,

Journey they afterwards made to <hi>Babylon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 1. 6.</note> became in a ſhort time
better inſtructed: For upon an Appeal, which the Prophet <hi>Zechariah</hi>
made to the Children of theſe prophane Scoffers, <hi>whether God's
Words</hi> and his <hi>Statutes, which he had commanded by his Servants the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Prophets, had not overtaken their</hi> ſtubborn <hi>Fathers;</hi> They, in deſpite
of their proud Hearts, were forced to confeſs, That <hi>like as the Lord
had purpoſed to do unto them, according to their ways, and according to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100722:24"/>
their doings, even ſo had he dealt with them.</hi> And, <hi>Haſt thou not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
this unto thy ſelf,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 17.</note> ſaith our Prophet here in the Text, <hi>in that thou
haſt forſaken the Lord, when he led thee by the way?</hi> And hereupon the
Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> doth not doubt to declare <hi>God's Judgments</hi> for Sin,<note place="margin">Chap. 6. 5.</note> to
be <hi>as clear as the Light that goeth forth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are then Judgments for Sin:<note place="margin">Zech. 5. 1.</note> There is a <hi>flying Roll</hi> which

<hi>rotts</hi> and conſumes <hi>the Timber,</hi> and <hi>eats out the ſtone-work</hi> thereof.
And why then muſt this above all other eſcape, this ſo black a Sin of
Irreligion? which ſtriketh directly at God himſelf; and therefore as
good old <hi>Eli</hi> reproving his wicked Sons, ſaith, is the <hi>hardeſt to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated</hi>

For, <hi>Jupiter</hi> being offended, doth puniſh all, ſaid the Poet; and in

            <p>Lift up thy hand againſt the ſtrange Nations, and let them ſee thy power.</p>
            <p>As thou waſty ſanctified in us before them: ſo be thou magnified among
them before us.</p>
            <p>And let them know thee, as we have known thee, that there is no God, but
only thou, O Lord.</p>
            <p>Shew new Signs, and make other ſtrange Wonders: glorify thy Hand and
thy right Arm, that they may ſet forth thy wonderous Works.</p>
            <p>Raiſe up Indignation, and pour out Wrath: take away the Adverſary,
and deſtroy the Enemies <hi>of thy Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Make the time ſhort, remember the Covenant, and let them declare thy
wondrous Works.</p>
            <p>Smite in ſunder the Heads of thoſe that ſay, There is none other but we,
and let them periſh that oppreſs thy People.</p>
            <p>O be merciful to Jeruſalem thy holy City, the place of thy Reſt.</p>
            <p>Fill Sion, that it magnify thine Oracles, and thy People, <hi>that they may
ſet forth</hi> thy Glory.</p>
            <p>Give Teſtimony to thoſe whom thou hast poſſeſſed from the beginning:
and raiſe up Prophets that may ſpeak in thy Name: and let thy Prophets be
found faithful.</p>
            <p>O Lord hear the Prayer of thy Servants, according to the Bleſſing of
Aaron over thy People, that all they which dwell upon the Earth may know
that thou art the Lord, the Eternal God. <hi>Amen.</hi>
