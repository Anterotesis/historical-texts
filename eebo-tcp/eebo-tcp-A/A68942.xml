         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or as much as thys epiſtle is the principall and moſte excellente parte of the newe teſtament, and moſte pure Euangelion: that is to ſaye, glad tydinges and that we call Goſpell: and alſo a light and a waye in vnto the whole ſcripture: I thinke it mete, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chriſten man not only know it by rote and without the boke: but alſo exercyſe hym ſelfe therein euermore continually, as with the dayly breade of the ſoule. No man verely can rede it to ofte, or ſtudye it to well: for the more it is ſtudyed the eaſier it is, the more it is ſhewed, the pleaſanter it is, and the more groundely it is ſerched, the precyouſer thynges are founde in it, ſo greate treaſure of ſpirituall thynges lyeth hyd therin.</p>
               <p>I will therfore beſtowe my laboure and diligence thorow this lytel pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face or Prologue, to prepare a waye in there vnto, ſo farforth as God ſhal geue me grace, that it maye be the better vnderſtande of euery man. For it hathe bene hetherto euyll darckened with gloſes and wonderfull dreames of Sophiſters, that no man coulde ſpie out the entent and meaning of it. Which neuertheleſſe yet of it ſelfe is a bryght lyght, and ſufficient to geue light vnto all the ſcripture.</p>
               <p>Fyrſt we muſte marke diligentlie the maner of ſpeaking of the Apoſtle, and aboue all thing know what Paul meaneth by theſe wordes, the Law, Syn, Grace, Faith, Righteouſnes, Fleſh, ſprite, &amp; ſuch like, or els rede thou it neuer ſo ofte, thou ſhalt but loſe thy labour. This word Law may not be vnderſtand here after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune maner, &amp; to vſe Paules terme, after the maner of men or after mans waies: that thou wouldeſt ſay the law here in this place wer nothing but learning which teacheth what ought to be done &amp; what ought not to be done: as it goeth with mans lawe where the law is fulfilled with outward workes only, though the herte be neuer ſo farre of. But God iudgeth the grounde of the heart, yea and the thoughtes and the ſecret monynges of the mynde, &amp; therfore his lawe requyreth the grounde of the herte &amp; loue from the botome therof, &amp; is not contente with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde worke onely: but rebuketh thoſe workes moſt of all whiche ſpring not of loue, from the ground and low botome of the herte: though they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere outward neuer ſo honeſt and good. As Chriſt in the Goſpel rebuketh the Phariſes aboue al other that were open ſinners, and calleth them ypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, that is to ſaye ſimulars and painted ſepulcres. Which Phariſes yet lyued no men ſo pure, as perteyning to the outewarde dedes and workes of the lawe: yea and Paul in the thyrd Chapter of hys epiſtle vnto the Philippians confeſſeth of hym ſelfe, that as touchynge the lawe he was ſuche a one as no man coulde complayne on, and not withſtanding was yet a murderer of the Chriſten, perſecuted them, and formented them ſo ſore, that he compelled them to blaſpheme Chriſt, &amp; was all together mercileſſe, as many which now fayne outwarde good workes, are.</p>
               <p>For this cauſe the .cxv. Pſalme calleth all men lyars, becauſe that no
<pb facs="tcp:7459:5"/>
in anne kepeth the lawe from the grounde of the herte, nether can kepe it, though he appeare outward full of good workes.</p>
               <p>For all men are naturally enclyned vnto euyll, and hate the lawe. We fynde in oure ſelues vnluſt and tediouſnes to do good, but luſt and delecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion to do euyll: Nowe where no fre luſt is to do good, there the botome of the hert fulfilleth not the lawe, and there no doubte is alſo ſinne, and wrath is deferued before God, though there be neuer ſo greate an outwarde ſhew and appearaunce of honeſt liuinge.</p>
               <p>For this cauſe concludeth ſaynte Paule in the ſeconde Chapter, that the Iewes are al ſinners and tranſgreſſors of the lawe, though thei make men beleue, thorow ypocriſy of outwarde workes, how that they fulfil the law, and ſayeth that he onely whiche doeth the lawe, is righteous before God, meanyng therby that no man with outward workes fulfilleth the lawe.</p>

Wherin thou iudgeſt an other man, therin condemneſt thou thy ſelfe, for thou thy ſelf doeſt euen the very ſame thinges which thou iudgeſt. As though he woulde ſaye, thou liueſt outwardly well in the workes of the lawe, and iudgeſt them that liue not ſo. Thou teacheſt other menne, and ſeeſt a moote in an other mannes eye, but art not ware of the beame that is in thyne owne eye. For though thou kepe the lawe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly with workes, for feare of rebuke, ſhame and punnyſhment, eyther for loue of rewarde, vauntage and vayne glory: yet doeſt thou all without luſte and loue towarde the lawe, and haddeſt leuer a greate deale other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe do, yf thou diddeſt not feare the lawe, yea inwardly in thine hert thou wouldeſt that there were no lawe, no nor yet God, the auctor and vengear of the lawe, yf it were poſſible: ſo paynefull it is vnto the to haue thyne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites refrayned, and to be kepte downe.</p>
               <p>Wherfore then it is a plaine concluſion, that thou from the ground and bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ome of thine hearte, arte an enemy to the lawe: what preuayleth it now, that thou teacheſte an other man not to ſteale, when thou thyne owne ſelfe arte a thefe in thyne hert, &amp; outwardly wouldeſt faine ſteale yf thou durſt? though that the outward dedes abyde not alwaye behinde with ſuche ipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites and diſſimulars, but breake forth amonge euen as an euyll ſcabbe or a pocke cannot allwayes be kepte in with violence of medicine.</p>
               <p>Thou teacheſt an other man, but teacheſt not thy ſelfe, yea thou woteſte not what thou teacheſt, for thou vnderſtandeſt not the lawe a right, howe that it cannot be fulfilled &amp; ſatiſfyed, but with an vnfained loue &amp; affeccion, ſo greately it cannot be fulfylled with outwarde dedes and workes onely. Moreouer the lawe encreaſeth ſynne, as he ſayeth in the fyfte Chapter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that man is an enemye to the lawe, for as muche as it requyreth ſo many thynges clene contrarie to his nature, whereof he is not able to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyll one pointe or title, as the lawe requireth it. And therfore are we more prouoked, and haue greater luſt to breake it.</p>
               <p>For whiche cauſes ſake he ſayeth in the ſeuenth Chapter, that the law is ſpirituall: as though he woulde ſaye, yf the lawe were fleſhlye and but mans doctrine, it myght be fulfylled, ſatyſfyed and ſtylled with outwarde dedes. But nowe is the lawe goſtly, and no man fulfilleth it, excepte that all that he doeth, ſpringe of loue from the botome of the hert. Suche a newe
<pb facs="tcp:7459:5"/>
herte and luſty corage vnto the lawe warde, canſte thou neuer come by of thyne owne ſtrength and enforcement, but by the operacion and workinge of the ſpirite.</p>
               <p>For the ſpirite of God only maketh a manne ſpiritual and lyke vnto the lawe, ſo that now henceforth he doeth nothinge of feare or for lucre or van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages ſake, or of vayne glory, but of a fre hert, and of inwarde luſt. The law is ſpirituall and wil be bothe loued and fulfylled of a ſpirituall hearte, and therfore of neceſſitie requireth it the ſpirite that maketh a mannes her fre, and geueth him luſt and courage vnto the lawe ward. Where ſuch a ſpirite is not, there remayneth ſynne, grudginge and hatred agaynſte the lawe, which lawe neuertheleſſe is good, righteous and holy.</p>
               <p>Acquaynte thy ſelfe therfore with the maner of ſpeaking of the Apoſtle, and let this now ſticke faſte in thyne herte, that it is not bothe one, to do the dedes and workes of the lawe, and to fulfyll the lawe. The worke of the lawe is, what ſo euer a manne doeth or can do of his owne free wyll, of his owne proper ſtrength and enforſyng. Not withſtandyng though there bee neuer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This meaneth Paul in the thirde Chapter where he ſayeth, by the dedes of the lawe ſhall no fleſhe bee iuſtyfyed in the ſight of God. Hereby perceaueſt thou that thoſe ſophiſters are but deceauers, which teache that a manne maye, and muſte prepare him ſelfe to grace and to the fauoure of God with good workes, before he haue the ſpirite and true faithe of Chriſte. Howe can they prepare them ſelues vnto the fauoure of God, and to that whiche is good, when they them ſelues can do no good, nor cannot once thinke a good thought or conſent to do good, the deuyl poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing their hertes, myndes and thoughtes captiue at his pleaſure? Canne thoſe workes pleaſe God thynkeſt thou, whiche are done with gryfe, payne and tediouſnes, with an euyll wyll, with a contrary and grudgyng mynde? O holy ſayncte Proſperus, how myghtely with the ſcripture of Paul, dyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou confound this hereſie, aboute (I trowe) a twelue hundred yeares a goo, or there vpon.</p>
               <p>To fulfill the lawe, to do the workes therof, and what ſoeuer the lawe commaundeth, with loue, luſt, and inwarde affeccion and delectacion: and to lyue godly and wel, frely, wyllingly, and without compulſyon of the lawe, euen as though there were no lawe at all: Such luſt and free libertie to the lawe, cometh onlye by the workynge of the ſpirite in the herte, as he ſaieth in the fyrſt Chapter.</p>
               <p>Nowe is the ſpirite none other wiſe geuen then by faithe onely, in that we beleue the promiſes of God, without wauering, how that God is true, and wyll fulfyll all his good promyſes towarde vs for Chriſtes bloudes ſake, as it is playne in the .i. Chapter. I am not aſhamed (ſayeth Paul) of Chriſtes gladde tydynges, for it is the power of God vnto ſaluacion to as many as beleue.

the worde or glad tydynges of God, when Chriſte is preached how that he is Gods ſonne and man alſo, dead and riſen again for our ſakes: as he ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the .iii.iiii. and .x. Chapters. All our iuſtifying then commeth of fayth, and fayth and the ſpirite come of God and not of vs.</p>
               <p>When we ſaye, faythe bringeth the ſpirite, it is not to bee vnderſtande, that faith deſerueth the ſpirite, or that the ſpirite is not preſent in vs before fayth. For the ſpirite is euer in vs, and faythe is the gyfte and workyng of the ſpirite. But thorow preaching the ſpirite beginneth to worke in vs. And as by preachinge the lawe, he worketh the feare of God, ſo by preachynge the glad tydinges, he worketh faythe. And nowe when we beleue and are come vnder the couenaunt of God, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are we ſure of the ſpirite, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſe of God, and then the ſpirite accompaineth fayth inſeperablie: and we begynne to fele his workinge. And ſo faythe certifyeth vs of the ſpirite, and alſo bringeth the ſpirite with her, vnto the workynge of all other gyftes of grace, and to the working oure of the reſt of oure ſaluacion, vntill we haue all to gether ouercome ſynne, death, hell and Satan: and are come vnto the euerlaſtynge lyfe of glory. And for thys cauſe ſaye we: faythe bryngeth the ſpirite.</p>
               <p>Hereof commeth it, that faythe onely iuſtifieth, maketh righteous, and fulfilleth the law: for it bryngeth the ſpirite thorow Chriſtes deſeruynges, the ſpirite bryngeth luſte, looceth the hert, maketh him free, ſetteth him at libertie, and geueth him ſtrength to worke the dedes of the lawe with loue, euen as the lawe requireth. Then at the laſt out of the ſame faythe ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge in the herte, ſpringe all good workes by their owne accorde. That meaneth he in the thyrde Chapter: for after he hath caſt awaye the workes of the lawe, ſo that he ſoundeth as though he woulde breake and diſanull the lawe thorow faythe: he aunſwereth to that myght be layde agaynſte, ſaying: we deſtroy not the lawe thorow faythe: but mayntyene, further, or ſtablyſhe the lawe thorow faythe. That is to ſaye, we fulfyll the lawe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row faythe.</p>
               <p>Synne in the ſcripture is not called that outwarde worke onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the body, but all the whole buſynes and what ſoeuer accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth, moueth or ſtereth vnto the outwarde dede, and that whence the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes ſpringe: as vnbelefe, pronenes and redines vnto the dede in the ground of the herte, with all the powers, affeccions and appetytes, wherwith we can but ſynne. So that we ſaye, that a man then ſumeth, when he is caried awaye hedlonge into ſynne, all to gether as muche as he is of that poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, inclynacion and corrupte nature, wherin he was conceyued and borne. For there is none outwarde ſynne committed, excepte a manne be caryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye all together, with lyfe, ſoule, herte, bodye, luſte and mynde therunto. The ſcripture loketh ſingularly vnto the herte and vnto the rote and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall fountayne of all ſynne, whiche is vnbelefe in the botome of the herte. For as faythe onely iuſtifieth and bryngeth the ſpirite and luſte vnto the outwarde good workes, euen ſo vnbelefe only damneth and kepeth out the ſpirite, prouoketh the fleſhe, and ſtereth vp luſte vnto the euyll outwarde workes, as happened to Adam and Eua in Paradiſe. Geneſis .iii.</p>
               <p>For this cauſe Chriſt calleth ſynne vnbelefe, and that notably in the .xvi. Chapter of ſainct Iohn. The ſpirite ſayeth he, ſhall rebuke the worlde of
<pb facs="tcp:7459:7"/>
ſynne, becauſe they beleue not in me. And Iohn .viii. he ſayeth: I am the lyght of the world. And therfore in the .xii. of Iohn he byddeth them while they haue light, to beleue in the light, that ye may be the chyldren of light: for he that walketh in darkenes woteth not whither he goeth. Nowe as Chriſt is the light, ſo is the ignoraunce of Chriſt that darkenes wherof he ſpeaketh: in whiche he that walketh, woteth not whither he goeth: that is, he knoweth not howe to worke a good worke in the ſyght of god, or what a good worke is. And therefore in the .ix. he ſayeth, as longe as I am in the worlde, I am the lyght of the worlde: but there cometh nyght when no manne can worke: which nyght is but the ignoraunce of Chriſt, in which no man can ſe to do any worke that pleaſeth God. And Paul exhorteth, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſi .iiii. that they walke not as other hethen whiche are ſtraungers from the lyfe of god, thorow the ignoraunce that is in them. And agayne in the ſame Chapter. Put of (ſaieth he) the olde man whiche is corrupt thorowe the luſtes of erroure, that is to ſaye ignoraunce. And Rom .xiii. Let vs caſte away the dedes of darckenes: that is to ſay, of ignoraunce &amp; vnbeleue. And i. Pet .i. Faſſion not your ſelues vnto youre olde luſtes of ignoraunce. And .i. Iohn .ii. He y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> loueth his brother dwelleth in light: &amp; he that hateth his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther walketh in darckenes, and woteth not whither he goeth, for darcknes hathe blynded his eyes. By lyght he meaneth the knowledge of Chriſt, and by darckenes, the ignoraunce of Chriſte. For it is impoſſyble that he that knoweth Chriſte truly, ſhoulde hate his brother.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, to perceaue this thing more clearly, thou ſhalt vnderſtande, that it is impoſſible to ſinne any ſynne at all, excepte a man breake the firſt commaundemente before. Nowe is the firſt commaundement deuyded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two verſes: Thy Lorde God is one God, and thou ſhalt loue thy Lorde God with al thine heart, with al thy ſoule, with al thy power, &amp; with al thy might. And the whole cauſe why I ſynne againſt any inferiour precepte, is that this loue is not in mine hearte: for wer this loue wrytten in my heart, and were full and perfecte in my ſoule, it would kepe mine heart from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentinge vnto any ſynne. And the whole and onely cauſe why thys loue is not wrytten in our heartes, is that we beleue not the fyrſte parte, that our Lorde God is one God. For wiſt I what theſe wordes, one Lorde and one God meaneth: that is to ſaye, yf I vnderſtode that he made all, and ruleth all, and that what ſoeuer is done to me, whether it bee good or bad, is yet his will, and that he onely is the Lorde that ruleth and doeth it: and wiſt thereto what this worde myne meaneth: that is to ſaye, yf myne heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued and felte the infinite benefytes and kyndenes of God to me warde, and vnderſtode and erneſtly beleued the manyfolde couenauntes of mercy, wherwith God hathe bounde him ſelfe to be mine, wholy and all together, with all his power, loue, mercye, and might, then ſhoulde I loue him with all myne heart, ſoule, power, and myght, and of that loue euer kepe his commaundementes. So ſe ye now that as faythe is the mother of al good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and of al good workes, ſo is vnbelefe the grounde and rote of all euyll, and all euyll workes.</p>
               <p>Finally, yf any man, that hath forſaken ſinne and is conuerted to put hys truſt in Chriſte, and to kepe the lawe of god, doth fall at a time: the cauſe is, that the fleſhe thorowe negligence hathe choked the ſpirite, and oppreſſed
<pb facs="tcp:7459:8"/>
her, and taken from her the foode of her ſtrength: whiche fode is her medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion in God and in his wonderfull dedes, and in the manyfolde couenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Of this now vnderſtandeſt thou the .vii. Chapter. where Paul accuſeth him ſelfe as a ſynner, and yet in the .viii.

Neuertheleſſe in as muche as we beleue in Chriſt, and haue the earneſt and beginning of the ſpirite, and woulde fayne be perfecte, God is ſo louinge and fauourable vnto vs, that he will not loke on ſuche ſynne, nether will counte it as ſinne, but will deale with vs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to oure belefe in Chriſt, and according to his promyſes, which he hath ſworne to vs, vntyll the ſynne be full ſlaine and mortified by deathe.</p>

               <p>Faithe is then a liuely and ſtedfaſt truſte in the fauoure of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we committe oure ſelues all together vnto God: and that truſte is ſo ſurely grounded and ſtycketh ſo faſte in our heartes, that a manne woulde not once doute of it, though he ſhoulde dye a thouſande tymes therfore.

By the meanes whereof, willingly and without compulcion he is glad and redy to do good to euery man, to do ſeruice to euery man, to ſuffer all thinges, that God may be loued and prayſed, which hathe geuen him ſuche grace: ſo that it is impoſſible to ſeparat good workes from faithe, euen as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to ſeperate heere and burninge from fyre.</p>

               <p>Righteouſnes is euen ſuche fayth, and is called Goddes righteouſnes, or righteouſnes that is of valoure before God.

For though it be knowen and dayly vnderſtande by the creatures, that there is but one God, yet is nature of her ſelfe, without the ſpirite &amp; grace, ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt &amp; ſo poiſoned, that men nether can thanke him, nether worſhippe him,

               <p>In the .ii.

Theſe are they whiche deſpiſe the goodnes of God, and according to the hardenes of theyr heartes, heape together for them ſelues the wrathe of God. Furthermore ſaynct Paul as a true expounder of the lawe, ſuffreth no man to be without ſinne, but declareth that al they are vnder ſynne whiche of fre wil and of nature will liue well, and ſuffreth them not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the .iii. Chapter he mingleth both together, both the Iewes and the gentiles, and ſayth that the one is as the other, both ſinners: &amp; no difference betwene them, ſaue in this onelye, that the Iewes had the worde of God committed vnto them. And though many of them beleued not theron, yet is goddes trueth and promiſe thereby nether hurte nor miniſhed: and he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in hys waye and allegeth the ſayinge of the .L. Pſal. that God myght abyde true in hys woordes and ouercome when he is iudged. After that he returneth to hys purpoſe agayne, and proueth by the ſcripture that all men without difference or excepcion are ſynners, and that by the workes of the lawe no man is iuſtified: but that the lawe was geuen to vtter and to declare ſynne onely. Then he beginneth and ſheweth the righte waye vnto righteweſnes, by what meanes men muſt be made righteous and ſafe, and ſayeth: They are all ſynners and without prayſe before God, and muſte without their own deſeruinges be made righteous thorow faith in Chriſt, whiche hathe deſerued ſuche ryghteouſnes for vs, and is become vnto vs Goddes mercy ſtole for the remiſſion of ſynnes that are paſte, therby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that Chriſtes righteouſnes which commeth on vs thorowe fayth, hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth vs onely. Whiche righteouſnes ſayeth he is now declared thorow the goſpell, and was teſtified of before by the lawe and the Prophetes. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore (ſayeth he) the lawe is holpe and furdered thorow faithe, though that the workes therof with al theyr boſte are brought to nought, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not to iuſtifye.</p>
               <p>In the .iiii. Chapter (after that now by the .iii. fyrſte Chapters, the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes are opened, and the waye of faythe vnto rigteouſnes layde) he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to aunſwere vnto certayne obieccions and cauillacions. And fyrſte he putteth forthe thoſe blynde reaſons, whiche commonlye they that wilbe iuſtifyed by their owne woorkes, are wont to make when they heare that faythe onelye without woorkes iuſtifyeth, ſayinge: ſhall menne do no good woorkes: yea and yf faythe onelye iuſtyfye, what nedeth a manne to ſtudye for to do good workes? He putteth forthe therfore Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham for an enſample, ſayinge: What dyd Abraham with hys woorkes?
<pb facs="tcp:7459:10"/>
was al in vaine? came hys workes to no profyte? And ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham without &amp; before all workes was iuſtified and made ryghteous. In ſo muche that before the worke of circumcyſion he was prayſed of the ſcripture and called ryghteous by his fayth onely, Genelis .xv. So that he dyd not the worke of circumciſion for to be holpe therby vnto ryghteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which yet God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded him to do, and was a good worke of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: So in lyke wyſe no doute none other workes help any thing at all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a mans iuſtifyinge: but as Abrahams circumcyſion was an outewarde ſigne whereby he declared his righteouſnes which he had by faith, and his obedience and redynes vnto the wyll of God, euen ſo are all other good workes outwarde ſignes and outewarde frutes of fayth and of the ſpirit, which iuſtifye not a man, but that a man is iuſtifyed alredy before God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in the herte, thorowe faythe, and thorowe the ſpirite purchaſed by Chrſtes bloud.</p>
               <p>Herewith nowe ſtablyſheth Sayncte Paul his doctryne of fayth afore rehearſed in the .iij. Chapters, and bringeth alſo teſtimony of Dauid in the xiij. Pſalme, whiche calleth a manne bleſſed, not of workes, but in that hys ſynne is not reckened, and in that faythe is imputed for ryghteouſnes, though he abyde not afterwarde without good workes, when he is once iuſtifyed.</p>
               <p>For we are iuſtifyed, and receaue the ſpirite for to do good workes, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were it otherwyſe poſſible to do good workes, except we had fyrſte the ſpirite.</p>
               <p>For how is it poſſible to do any thynge well in the ſight of God, while we are yet in captiuitie and bondage vnder the deuyll, and the deuyll poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth vs all together and holdeth our hertes, ſo that we cannot ones con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto the wil of God. No man therfore can preuent the ſpirite in doing good: but the ſpirite muſt fyrſte come and wake hym out of hys ſlepe, and with the thunder of the lawe feare him, and ſhewe him hys miſerable eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and wretchednes, and make him abhorre and hate him ſelfe, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre helpe: and then comforte hym againe with the pleaſant rayne of the Goſpell, that is to ſaye, with the ſwete promyſes of God in Chriſte, and ſtiere vp faithe in hym to beleue the promiſes. Then when he beleueth the promiſes, as God was mercifull to promyſe, ſo is he true to fulfyll them, and will geue hym the ſpirite and ſtrength, bothe to loue the will of God, and to worke thereafter. So ſe we that God onelye (whiche according to the ſcripture worketh all in all thinges) worketh a mans iuſtifyinge, ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacion and healthe, yea and powreth faithe and belefe, luſt to loue goddes will, and ſtrength to fulfill the ſame, into vs, euen as water is powred into a veſſell, and that of his good will and purpoſe, and not of our deſeruinges and merites. Goddes mercy in promiſinge, and trueth in fulfilling his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes ſaueth vs, and not we our ſelues. And therfore is al laude, praiſe and glory, to bee geuen vnto God for hys mercy and trueth, and not vnto vs for oure merites and deſeruinges. After that he ſtretcheth hys enſample out agaynſte all other good workes of the lawe, and concludeth that the Iewes cannot be Abrahams heyres becauſe of bloude and kynred onely, &amp; much leſſe by the workes of the law, but muſt inheryt Abrahams fayth, if they wilbe the right heires of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for as much as Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before the

Moreouer the law cauſeth wrathe, in as much as no man can fulfil it with loue and uſie. And as longe as ſuche grudgynge, hate and indignacyon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the lawe remayneth in the herte, and is not taken awaye by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite that commeth by fayth, ſo longe (no doute) the workes of the lawe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare euidently that the wrath of God is vpon vs, and not fauoure. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faythe onely receyueth the grace promyſed vnto Abraham. And theſe enſamples were not written for Abrahams ſake onely (ſayeth he) but for ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es alſo, to whom yf we beleue, faythe ſhalbe rekened lykewyſe for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, as he ſayth in the ende of the Chapter.</p>
               <p>In the .v. Chapter he commendeth the frutes and workes of faythe, as are peace, reioyſing in the conſcience, inwarde loue to God and man: more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer boldnes, truſt, confydence and a ſtrong and a luſty mynde and ſtedfaſt hope in tribulacion and ſufferynge. For all ſuche folowe, where the ryghte fayth is, for the aboundaunte graces ſake and gyftes of the ſpirite, whiche God hathe geuen vs in Ieſu Chriſte, in that he gaue him to dye for vs yet his enemyes. Nowe haue we then, that faythe only before al workes iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth: and that it foloweth not yet therfore that a man ſhoulde do no good workes: but that the righte ſhapen workes abyde not behynde, but accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panye faythe, euen as bryghtnes doth the ſunne, and are called of Paul the frutes of the ſpirite: where the ſpirite is, there it is alwaies ſomer, and there are alwaies good frutes: that is to ſay, good workes. This is Pauls order, that good workes ſpringe of the ſpirite, the ſpirit commeth by faith, and fayth commeth by hearing the worde of God, when the glad tydinges and promiſes which God hath made to vs i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt, are preached truly, and receaued in the grounde of the hearte without wauering or doutynge, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the law hath paſſed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs &amp; hath damned oure conſciences, where the word of God is preached purely and receaued in the hert, there is faith and the ſpirite of God, and there are alſo good workes of neceſſitie when ſoeuer occaſion is geuen: where goddes worde is not purely preached, but mens dreames, tradicions, ymaginacions, inuencions, ceremonies and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſticion, there is no faythe, and conſequentlye no ſpirite that commeth of God. And where Goddes ſpirite is not, there can be no good workes, euen as where an apple tre is not, there can growe no apples, but there is vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefe, the deuels ſpirite and euyll workes. Of thys Goddes ſpirite and hys frutes haue oure holy ypocrites not once knowen, nether yet taſted howe ſwete they are, though they fayne many good workes of theyr owne yma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginacions, to be iuſtyfied with all, in whiche is not one crum of true faythe or ſpirituall loue, or of inwarde ioye, peace and quyetnes of conſcience, for as muche as they haue not the worde of God for them, that ſuch woorkes pleaſe God, but they are euen the rotten frutes of a rotten tre.</p>
               <p>After that he breaketh forth, and runneth at large, and ſheweth whence bothe ſynne and righteouſnes, deathe and lyfe come. And he compareth A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, and Chriſte together, thus wyſe reaſonynge and dyſputynge, that Chriſte muſte neades comme as a ſeconde Adam, to make vs heyres of hys ryghteweſnes, thorowe a newe ſpyrytuall byrthe, without oure deſeruynges: euen as the fyrſte Adam made vs heyres of ſynne, thorowe

the bodely generacyon, without oure deſeruing. Whereby is euidently knowen and proued to the vttermoſt, that no man can bring him ſelf out of ſynne vnto righteouſnes, nomore then he coulde haue withſtande that he was borne bodely. And that is proued herewith, for as muche as the very lawe of God, whiche of right ſhoulde haue holpe, yf any thinge could haue holpen, not onely came and brought no helpe with her, but alſo encreaſed ſynne, becauſe that the euyll and poyſoned nature is offended and vtterly diſpleaſed with the lawe, and the more ſhe is forbyd by the lawe, the more is ſhe prouoked and ſet a fyer to fulfill and ſatiſfye her luſtes. By the lawe then we ſe clerely that we muſt nedes haue Chriſte to iuſtifye vs with his grace, and to helpe nature.</p>
               <p>In the .vi. Chapter he ſetteth forth the chiefe and principal worke of faith, the battaill of the ſpirite againſt the fleſhe, howe the ſpirite laboreth and enforſeth to kyll the remnaunt of ſyn and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> whiche remaine in the fleſhe, after our iuſtifiyng. And this chapter teacheth vs, that we are not ſo free from ſynne thorowe faythe, that we ſhoulde hence forth go vp and downe ydle, careleſſe, and ſure of our ſelues, as though there were nowe no more ſynne in vs: yes ther is ſin remaining in vs, but it is not rekened, becauſe of faith, &amp; of the ſpirite which fight againſt it. Wherfore we haue ynough to do all oure lifes longe, to tame our bodies, and to compell the membres to obey the ſpirite, and not the appetites, that thereby we myght be like vnto Chriſtes death &amp; refurreccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and might fulfil our baptiſme, which ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the mortifyinge of ſynnes, and the newe life of grace. For this battayle ceaſeth not in vs vntill the laſt birthe, and vntill that ſinne be vtterly ſtaine by the death of the bodye.</p>
               <p>This thing (I meane to tame the body and ſo forth) we are able to do (ſayeth he) ſeyng we are vnder grace, and not vnder the lawe: what it is, not to be vnder the lawe, he hym ſelfe expoundeth. For not to be vnder the lawe is not ſo to be vnderſtande, that euery manne maye do what him luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth. But not to be vnder the lawe, is to haue a free hearte renewed with the ſpirite, ſo that thou haſt luſt inwardly of thyne own accorde to do that which the law commaundeth, without compulſion, yea though there were no lawe. For grace, that is to ſaye Goddes fauoure, bryngeth vs the ſpirit, and maketh vs to loue the lawe: ſo is there now no more ſynne, neyther is the lawe nowe any more agaynſt vs, but at one, and agreed with vs, and we with it.</p>
               <p>But to be vnder the lawe, is to deale with the workes of the lawe, and to worke without the ſpirite and grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ſo longe no doubte ſynne rayg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in vs thorow the lawe, that is to ſaye, the lawe declareth that we are vnder ſynne, and that ſynne hath power and dominion ouer vs, ſeynge we cannot fulfyll the lawe, namely within the hearte, for as muche as no man of nature fauoreth the lawe, conſenteth there vnto, and delyteth therein. Which thyng is exceading great ſynne, that we cannot conſent to the law, which lawe is nothyng els ſaue the will of God.</p>
               <p>This is the ryght fredome and libertie from ſinne, and from the lawe wherof he writeth vnto the ende of thys Chapter, that is a fredome to do good onelye with luſte, and to lyue well without compulcyon of the lawe: wherfore thys fredome is a ſpirituall fredome, whiche deſtoyeth

Euen as though thou were in dette to an other man, and were not able to paye, two maner wayes myghteſt thou be lowſed. One waye, yf he woulde require nothyng of the, and breke thyne obligacion. An other waye, yf ſome other good man woulde paye for the, and geue the as much as thou myghteſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the .vij. Chapter he confyrmeth the ſame with a ſimilytude of the ſtate of matrimony. As when the huſband dyeth, the wyfe is at her liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the one looced and departed from the other, not that the woman ſhould not haue power to mary vnto an other man, but rather now fyrſt of all is ſhe fre, and hath power to mary vnto an other man, which ſhe coulde not do before, tyll ſhe was looced from her fyrſt houſband: Euen ſo are our conſciences bound and in daunger to the law vnder old Adam the fleſh, as long as he liueth in vs. For the law declareth that our hertes are bounde &amp; that we cannot diſconſent from him. But when he is mortifyed and kylled by the ſpirite, then is the conſcience fre and at lybertye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not ſo that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhall nowe nought do, but now fyrſt of al cleueth vnto another, that is to were Chriſt, and bringeth forthe the frutes of lyfe. So <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ow to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the lawe, is not to be able to fulfyll the lawe, but to be detter to it, and not able to paye that whiche the lawe requyreth. And to be looce from the lawe, is to fulfyll it and to pay that which the lawe demaundeth, ſo that it can nowe hence forth are thee nought.</p>
               <p>Conſequently Paul declareth more largely the nature of ſynne and of the lawe, how that thorow the lawe ſynne reuiueth, moueth hir ſelfe, and gathereth ſtrength. For the old man and corrupt nature, the more he is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boden and kepte vnder of the lawe, is the more offended and dyſpleaſed therewith, for as muche as he cannot paye that whiche is requyred of the lawe. For ſynne is his nature, and of hym ſelfe he cannot but ſynne. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the lawe death to him, torment and martyrdome. Not that the law is euill, but becauſe that the euyll nature cannot ſuffre that which is good, cannot abyde that the law ſhould require of him any good thinge. Lyke as a ſicke man cannot ſuffre that a man ſhould deſire of him to run, to lepe, and to do other dedes of an whole manne.</p>
               <p>For whiche cauſe. S. Paul concludeth, that where the lawe is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande and perceaued of the beſte wiſe, there it doeth no more but vtter ſynne, and bring vs vnto the knowledge of our ſelues, and thereby kyll vs and make vs bonde vnto eternall damnacion, and detters of the euerlaſting wrathe of god, euen as he wel fealeth and vnderſtandeth whoſe conſcience is truely touched of the lawe. In ſuch daunger were we yer the law came, that we knewe not what ſynne ment, nether yet knewe we the wrathe of God vpon ſynners, tyll the lawe had vttered it. So ſeeſt thou that a man muſt haue ſome other thing, yea and a greater and a more myghty thinge then the lawe, to make hym ryghteous and ſafe. They that vnderſtande
<pb facs="tcp:7459:12"/>
not the lawe on this wiſe, are blinde, and go to worke preſumptuouſly, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſyng to ſatiſfie the lawe with workes. For they knowe not that the lawe requireth a fre, a willinge, a luſty and a louynge hearte. Therfore they ſee not Moſes ryght in the face, the vayle hangeth betwene and hydeth hys face, ſo that they cannot beholde the glorye of hys countenaunce, how that the lawe is ſpirituall &amp; requyreth the hearte. I may of myne owne ſtrength refraine that I do mine enemy no hurte, but to loue hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with al mine heart, and to put awaye wrathe cleane out of my mynde, can I not of myne owne ſtrength. I maye refuſe money of myne owne ſtrength, but to put awaye loue vnto riches out of myne hearte, can I not do of mine own ſtrength. To abſtayne from adultery as concerning the outward dede, can I do of myne owne ſtrength, but not to deſyre in mine hearte is as vnpoſſible vnto me as is to choſe whether I will honger or thurſt, and yet ſo the lawe requyreth. Wherfore of a mans owne ſtrength is the lawe neuer fulfilled, we muſte haue thereunto goddes fauoure, and hys ſpyryte, purchaſed by Chriſtes bloude.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe when I ſaye a man maye do many thynges outwardly clene againſte his hearte, we muſte vnderſtande that man is but dryuen of diuers appetites, and the greateſt appetite ouercommeth the leſſe and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth the man awaye violently with her.</p>
               <p>As when I deſire vengeaunce, and feare alſo the inconuenience that is lyke to folowe: yf feare be greater, I abſteyne, yf the appetite that deſireth vengeaunce be greater, I cannot but proſecute the dede, as we ſe by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in many murtherers and theues: which though they bee brought into neuer ſo great perill of death, yet after they haue eſcaped, do euen the ſame againe. And commen wemen proſecute their luſtes, becauſe fear and ſhame are awaye, when other whiche haue the ſame appetites in theyr heartes, abſtayne at the leſtewaye outwardly, or worke ſecretly being ouercome of feare and of ſhame, and ſo lykewyſe is it of al other appetites.</p>
               <p>Furthermore he declareth, how the ſpirite and the fleſh fight together in one manne, and maketh an enſample of him ſelfe, that we myght lerne to knowe that worke aright, I meane to kyll ſynne in oure ſelues. He calleth both the ſpirite and alſo the fleſh a lawe, becauſe that lyke as the nature of Goddes lawe is to dryue, to compell, and to craue, euen ſo the fleſhe dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth compelleth, craueth, and rageth agaynſte the ſpirite, and will haue her luſtes ſatiſfied. On the other ſyde dryueth the ſpirite, cryeth, and figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth agaynſte the fleſhe, and wyl haue his luſte ſatiſfied. And this ſtrife du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>eth in vs, as longe as we lyue: in ſome more and in ſome leſſe, as the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite or the fleſhe is ſtronger, and the very man his owne ſelfe is both ſpirite and the fleſh, which fyghteth with his owne ſelfe vntyll ſynne bee vtterly ſlaine and we all together ſpirituall.</p>
               <p>In the .viij. Chapter he comforteth ſuch fighters that they diſpaire not becauſe of ſuche fleſh, either thinke y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they are leſſe in fauour with God. And he ſheweth how that the ſynne remaining in vs, hurteth not, for there is no daunger to them that are in Chriſte whiche walke not after the fleſhe, but fyght agaynſte it. And he expoundeth more largely what the nature of the fleſh and of the ſpirite is, and how the ſpirite cometh by Chriſte, which ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite maketh vs ſpyrituall, tameth, ſubdueth, and mortifieth the fleſhe, and
<pb facs="tcp:7459:12"/>
certyfieth vs that we are neuertheleſſe the ſonnes of God, and alſo beloued though that ſynne rage neuer ſo moche in vs, ſo long as we folowe the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite and fyght againſt ſynne to kyll and mortifye it. And becauſe nothynge is ſo good to the mortifiynge of the fleſhe, as the croſſe and tribulacion, he comforteth vs in our paſſions and affliccions, by the aſſiſtens of the ſpirite which maketh interceſſion to God for vs myghtely, with gronynges that paſſe mans vtteraunce, ſo that mans ſpeche cannot comprehende them, and with the mourning alſo of the creatures with vs, of greate deſire that they haue, that we were looced from ſynne and corrupcion of the fleſhe. So ſe we that theſe thre chapters, the .vj.vii.viij. do none other thing ſo muche as to dryue vs vnto the right worke of faithe, which is to kil the olde man and mortify the fleſhe.</p>
               <p>In the .ix.x. and .xi. Chapter he treateth of Goddes predeſtinacion: whence it ſpringeth all together, whether we ſhall beleue or not beleue, be looced from ſynne or not bee looced. By whiche predeſtinacion oure iuſtifying and ſaluacion are clene taken out of oure handes, and put in the handes of God only, which thinge is moſte neceſſary of al. For we are ſo weake and ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, that if it ſtode in vs, there would of a truth no manne be ſaued: the deuyll no doute would deceaue vs. But now is God ſure that his predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacion cannot deceaue him, nether can any man withſtande or let him, and therefore haue we hope and truſt agaynſt ſynne.</p>
               <p>But here muſt a marke be ſet vnto thoſe vnquyet, buſye, and hie clyming ſpirites howe farre they ſhall go, whiche fyrſte of al bringe hither their hye reaſons and pregnant wyttes, and begyn fyrſt from an hye to ſerch the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe ſecretes of Goddes predeſtinacion, whether they bee predeſtinate or not. Theſe muſte nedes ether caſte them ſelues doune headlong into deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peracion, or elſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit them ſelues to fre chaunce careleſſe. But folow thou the order of this epiſtle, and nooſell thy ſelfe with Chriſte, and lerne to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande what the lawe and the goſpell meane, and the office of both two, that thou mayeſt in the one knowe thy ſelfe, and how that thou haſt of thy ſelfe no ſtrength, but to ſinne: and in the other the grace of Chriſt. And then ſe thou fight agaynſte ſinne, and the fleſhe, as the .vii. fyrſt Chapters teache the. After that when thou art come to the .viij. Chapter, and arte vnder the croſſe and ſuffring of tribulacion, the neceſſitie of predeſtinacion will waxe ſwete, and thou ſhalt well fele how preciouſe a thinge it is. For except thou haue borne the croſſe of aduerſitie and temptacion, and haſte felte thy ſelfe brought vnto the very brymme of deſperacion, yea &amp; vnto hell gates, thou canſt neuer medle with the ſentence of predeſtinacion without thine owne harme, and without ſecret wrathe and grudging inwardly agaynſt God, for otherwiſe it ſhal not be poſſible for the to thinke that God is righteous and iuſte. Therfore muſte Adam be well mortifyed and the fleſhely witte brought vtterly to nought, yer that thou mayeſt awaye with this thinge, and drynke ſo ſtronge wyne. Take hede therfore vnto thy ſelfe, that thou drinke not wyne, whyle thou art yet but a ſuklinge. For euery learnynge hath her tyme, meaſure and age, and in Chriſt is there a certayne chylde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hod, in which a man muſt be content with mylke for a ſeaſon, vntil he waxe ſtronge, and growe vp vnto a perfecte manne in Chriſt, and be able to eate of more ſtrong meate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7459:13"/>In the .xii. Chap. he geueth exhortacion. For this maner obſerueth Paul in all his epiſtles, fyrſt he teacheth Chriſt and the faythe, then exhorteth he to good workes, and vnto contynuall mortifyinge of the fleſhe. So here teacheth he good workes in dede, and the true ſeruynge of God, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Prieſtes, to offre vp, not money, and beaſtes, as the maner was in the tyme of the lawe, but their owne bodyes, with kyllynge and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyinge of the luſtes of the fleſh. After that he deſcribeth the out warde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſacion of Chriſten men, how they ought to behaue them ſelues in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall thinges, how to teache, preach &amp; rule in the congregacion of Chriſt, to ſerue one another, to ſuffre all thinges pacientlye, and to commyt the wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the .xiii. he teacheth to honour the worldly and temporall ſwearde. For though that mans lawe and ordinaunce make nor a man good before God, nether iuſtify hi in the hert, yet are they ordeyned for the furtherau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the commune welth, to mayntene peace, to puniſh the euyl and to defend the good. Therfore ought the good to honoure the temporall ſwerde, and to haue it in reuerence, though as concerning them ſelues, they nede it not, but woulde abſteyne from euyll of theyr owne accorde: yea and do good with out ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s law, but by the law of the ſpirite which gouerneth the herte, and gideth it vnto all that is the wyll of God. Fynally he comprehendeth &amp; knitteth vp all in loue. Loue of her owne nature beſtoweth al that ſhe hath, and euen her owne ſelfe on that whiche is loued. Thou nedeſt not to byd a kynd mother to be louyng vnto her only ſonne. Moche leſſe ſpirituall loue which hath eyes geuen her of God, neadeth mans lawe to teache her to do her dutye. And as in the begynnynge he dyd put forthe Chriſte as the cauſe and auctor of our ryghteweſnes and ſaluacion, euen ſo here ſetteth he him forth as an enſample to counterfayte, that as he hathe done to vs, euen ſo ſhulde we do one to another.</p>
               <p>In the .xiiii. chapter he teacheth to deale ſoberly with the conſciences of the weake in the fayth, whiche vnderſtand not yet the libertye of Chriſte perfectly ynough, and to fauer them of Chriſten loue, and not to vſe the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of the fayth vnto hynderaunce, but vnto the furderaunce and edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge of the weake.

                  </gap>pell. It is better therfore to forbeare the weake a whyle, vntyll they waxe ſtronge, then that the learnynge of the Goſpell ſhould come al together vnderfote. And ſuch worke is the ſingular worke of loue, and where loue is perfecte, there muſt nedes be ſuch a reſpecte vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the weake, a thynge that Chriſte commaunded and charged to be had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all thinges.</p>
               <p>In the .xv. Chapter he ſetteth forthe Chriſte againe to be folowed, that we alſo by hys enſample, ſhoulde ſuffre other that are yet weake, as them that are fraile, open ſinners, vnlerned, vnexperte, and of lotheſome maners, and not to caſte them awaye forthwith: but to ſuffre them tyll they ware better: and exhorte them in the meane time. For ſo dealte Chriſt in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell

and now dealeth with vs dayly, ſufferyng our vnperfectnes, weaknes, conuerſacion and maners, not yet faſſioned after the doctryne of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, but ſmel of the fleſhe, yea &amp; ſometime breake forth into outward dedes.</p>
               <p>After that to conclude withal, he wyſheth them encreace of faith, peace, and ioye of conſcience, prayſeth them and committeth them to God, and magnifyeth his office and admyniſtracyon in the Goſpell, and ſoberly and with greate diſcrecion deſyreth ſuccoure and ayde of them for the poore ſaynctes of Ieruſalem, and it is al pure loue that he ſpeaketh or dealeth with al. So fynde we in this epiſtle plenteouſly, vnto the vttermoſt, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer a Chriſten man or woman ought to know, that is to were, what the Lawe, the Goſpell, Synne, Grace, Faith, Righteouſnes, Chriſt, God, good workes, Loue, Hope, and the croſſe are, and euen wherein the pythe of all that pertayneth to the Chriſten fayth ſtandeth, and how a Chriſten manne ought to behaue him ſelfe vnto euery man, be he perfect or a ſynner, good or bad, ſtronge or weake, frende or foo, and in concluſion how to behaue oure ſelues both toward God and toward our ſelues alſo. And all thinges are profoundely grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in the ſcriptures, and declared with enſamples of hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelf, of the fathers, &amp; of the prophetes, that a man can here deſyre nomore.</p>
               <p>Wherfore it appereth euydently, that Pauls mynde was to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hende brefely in thys Epiſtle all the whole learnyng of Chriſtes Goſpell, and to prepare an introduccion vnto all the olde teſtamente. For without doute whoſoeuer hath this piſtle perfectly in his herte, the ſame hath the lyght and the effecte of the olde teſtamente with him: wherefore let euery man without excepcion exercyſe him ſelfe therin diligently, and recorde it nyght and daye continually, vntyll he be full acquaynted therwith.</p>
               <p>The laſt Chapter is a chapter of reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherin he yet mingleth a good monicion, that we ſhulde beware of the tradicions and doctryne of men, which begyle the ſimple with ſophiſtry, and lernynge that is not after the Goſpel, and drawe them from Chriſt, and nooſell them in weake and feble, and (as Paul calleth them in the piſtle to the Galathyans) in begger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ceremonyes, for the entent that they would lyue in fatte paſtures and be in auctoritie, and be taken as Chriſt, yea and aboue Chriſte, and ſyt in the temple of God, that is to wit in the conſciences of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where God only, his worde, and his Chriſt ought to ſytte. Compare therfore all maner doctrine of men vnto the ſcripture, and ſe whether they agre or not. And commytte thy ſelfe whole and all together vnto Chriſte, and ſo ſhall he with his holy ſpirite and with all his fulnes dwell in thy ſoule.</p>
               <p>The ſumme and whole cauſe of the wrytynge of thys epyſtle, is, to proue that a man is iuſtified by fayth onely: which propoſicion who ſoeuer denyeth, to him is not onely this epiſtle and al that Paul wryteth, but alſo the whole ſcripture ſo locked vp, that he ſhall neuer vnderſtande it to hys ſoules health. And to bringe a man to the vnderſtandinge and felynge that faith onely iuſtifyeth: Paul proueth that the whole nature of manne is ſo poiſoned and ſo corrupte, yea and ſo dead, concerning godly liuing or godly thinkinge, that it is impoſſible for her to kepe the lawe in the ſight of God: that it to ſaye, to loue it, and of loue and luſt to do it as naturally as a man eateth or drincketh: vntill ſhe be quickened again and healed thorow faith.</p>
               <p>And by iuſtifying, vnderſtand none other thing then to be reconciled to

Chriſtes workes only iuſtifie the, &amp; make ſatiſfaccion for thy ſinne, and thyne owne workes not: that is to ſay, quieteth thy conſcyence, and make the ſure that thy ſynnes are forgeuen the, and not thine owne workes. For the promiſe of mercye is made the for Chriſtes workes ſake, &amp; not for thine owne workes ſake. Wherfore ſeinge God hathe not promyſed that thyne owne workes ſhall ſaue the, therfore faithe in thine owne workes can neuer quyet thy conſcience nor certifie the before God (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to iudge &amp; to take a reconing) y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> thy ſinnes are forgeuen the. Beyond all this, mine owne workes ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer ſatiſfie the law or pay her that I owe her. For I owe the law to loue her w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all mine heart, ſoule, power &amp; might. Whiche thing to paye I am neuer able whyle I am compaſſed with fleſhe. No, I cannot once beginne to loue the lawe, excepte I be fyrſte ſure by fayth that God loueth me and forgeueth me.</p>
               <p>Finallye that we ſaye fayth only iuſtifieth, ought to offende no man. For if this be trewe, that Chriſt only redemed vs, Chriſt only bare our ſynnes, made ſatiſfaccion for them &amp; purchaſed vs the fauour of God, then muſt it nedes be true, that the truſt only in Chriſtes deferning &amp; in the promyſes of God the father made vs for Chriſtes ſake, doth onely quiet the conſcience, &amp; certifie her that the ſinnes are forgeuen. And when they ſay, a man muſt repent, forſake ſin, &amp; haue a purpoſe to ſin no more as nye as he can, &amp; loue the lawe of God: Ergo fayth alone iuſtifieth not. I aunſwere: that, &amp; al like argumentes are nought, &amp; like to this. I muſt repent &amp; be forye, the Goſpel muſt be preached me, &amp; I muſt beleue it, or els I cannot be partaker of the mercye which Chriſte hath deſerued for me: Ergo Chriſt only iuſtifieth me or not, Chriſt onely hathe not made ſatiſfaccion for my ſinnes. As this is a naughty argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſo is the other. Now go to reader, &amp; according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Paules wryting, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo do thou. Fyrſt behold thy ſelfe dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly in the lawe of God, &amp; ſe there thy iuſt damnacion. Secondarely turne thyne eyes to Chriſte, and ſe there the exceading mercy of thy moſt kynde and louinge father. Thirdly remembre that Chriſte made not thys attonement that thou ſhouldeſt anger God againe: nether dyed he for thy ſynnes, that thou ſhouldeſt lyue ſtyll in them: nether clenſed he the, that thou ſhouldeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne (as a ſwyne) vnto thyne olde puddell againe: but that thou ſhouldeſt be a newe creature, and lyue a newe lyfe after the will of God, and not of the fleſhe. And be diligent leaſt thorowe thine own negligence and vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, thou loſe this fauoure and mercy againe.</p>

And fyrſt to beginne with the authors name, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it I knowe that ſainct Hierome in his commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries he wrote vpon the Epiſtle to Philemon, is of the minde, that Paul was fyrſt called Saule, and afterwarde called him ſelf Paule, in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braunce of the great and victorious acte, wherby he wonne vnto Chriſt Sergius Paule lieuetenaunt of Paphos in Cipres, as it is wryten in the .xiii. cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter of the Actes of thapoſtles: And though againe I knowe that other ſome be of the mynde, that Paule for the tyme, wherin he liued vnder the Iewes lawe was called Saule, &amp; that at the fyrſt beginnyng of his newe religion he chaunged his name: yet the one opinion ſemeth vnlikely, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuche as S. Luke in the chapiter before reherſed, <hi>(then Saule, vvhiche is alſo called paule, beyng full of the holy goſte)</hi> plainly by theſe wordes declareth that he had two names before Sergius Paules conuerſion: the other o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion ſemeth more vnlikely, as it appeareth, as well by that ſome els where, as eſpecially in the ſame chapiter euen at that tyme, when he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Chriſtes goſpel, he is called Saule, the holy gooſte ſpeakyng theſe wordes, <hi>deuide me Barnabas and ſaule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Me thinketh therfore, that Origens opinion is in this point nigher y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> trueth. For as in the bookes of the olde teſtament we fynde ſome, whiche had diuers names, as for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, one in one place is called Idida, whiche in an other is called Salomon, likewyſe an other is in ſome place called Ozias, whom ſcripture elswhere calleth Azarias, &amp; in the goſpel of Luke he is called Leui, whiche in his owne goſpel calleth him ſelfe Mathewe: ſo is it to be ſuppoſed that Paule had two names, though that in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles he neuer vſeth to call him ſelfe Saule, but in euerye place Paule, peraduenture becauſe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> name of Paule was more familiar among them that he wrote vnto, I meane the Romaines and Grecians. Now is the Latine worde Saulus after like ſorte deriued out of this Hebrue worde Saul, as the Grecians fourme Ioſephus of Ioſeph. This name Paule to them that vnderſtande the Heorue toungue ſignifieth, marueilous, if we may be ſuffered to ſearche the interpretacion of a Latine or Greeke worde out of a ſtraunge la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage, in whiche enterpriſe, albeit in other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers ſainct Hierome ſemeth to be ſcrupulous, yet herein beareth he with him ſelfe, I wene, becauſe the matter is not earneſte, nor muche weightie. For in dede with the Grecians the name ſoundeth, quiet, &amp; with the Latin menne litle, but Saul with the Hebrues, ſignifieth required, or if we geue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And this muche haue I ſayd of Paules name, more at large (I wene) tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the nature of an argument doeth wel beare. This epiſtle endited Paule, Tertius beyng his ſcribe, as Tertius him ſelfe at thende of the Epiſtle ſayth. <hi>And I tertius ſalute you alſo, vvhiche vvrote this epiſtle in the lorde.</hi> It ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peareth that it was ſent to Rome fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Corinthe by Phebe a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chris. Now is Cenchris the Corinthians porte, &amp; ſtandeth not farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> citie. And if any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be deſirous to know the tyme, when it was wryten, to ſuche as weigh the matier diligently, it may ſeme wryten after bothe the epiſtles to the Corinthians (wherof ſome gather, that in it aboue other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>priſed &amp; taught the ful &amp; perfite rules of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> religion) &amp; wryten aboute the ſame tyme that he had preached throughout the whole cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey of Achaia, wherin the citie of Corinthe ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth, &amp; alſo through the countrey of Macedonia borderyng nigh thervnto, euen vntil the coſte of Slauone, not only teachyng euery where Chriſtes goſpel in ſuche places where none of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other Apoſtles els had been, but gatheryng alſo (as Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter warned him) money of his hearers for the reliefe of the poore people, made him ſelfe ready to repayre vnto Ieruſalem, &amp; thence, after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had beſtowed that, whiche he had receiued, mynded to goe into Spayne, &amp; by the way to go through Rome, &amp; there to ſalute chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men, whoſe fayth &amp; godlynes he had onely heard of in dede, &amp; yet had he not ſene them. Their ſtate was ſomethyng vnlike the Galathians. For the Galathians beyng at the fyrſt well taught by ſainct Paule, were by fraude of falſe Apoſtles deceiued &amp; brought backewarde to Iewiſhnes againe. The Romaines co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwyſe beyng fyrſt miſſe taught &amp; by falſe preachers deceiued, aſſone as they according to theyr wiſdome perceiued it, they ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded theyr fault, faſte &amp; ſtedfaſtly after continuyng in ſuche a trade, as they well wyſt was good. In the infancie &amp; fyrſt chyldhod of Chriſtes churche ſome there wer whiche thought that the grace promiſed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpel ſhould not foorthw<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be preached vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> curſed Panymes geuen al to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worſhippyng of idols &amp; deuils, forſomuche as the ſame ſemed eſpecially piniſed to Abrahams poſteritee &amp; ſtocke of the Iewes. Of this mynde it appeareth that ſainct Peter was, as whiche would not haue receiued the capitayne Cornelius into Chriſtes religion, had he not been warned by a viſion ſo to do. For whiche dede he was troubled at Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what tyme they, that of Iewes were conuerted to Chriſt, layde vnto his charge, that he had been in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany among them, that wer not circumciſed. And likely it is, that ſome of them, whiche ſo accuſed Peter, were of thapoſtles them ſelfe. For in the xi. chapiter of the Actes ſo is it wryten: <hi>And the Apoſtles and brethren that were in Iurie, heard that the heathen had alſo receiued the worde of god. And when Peter was come vppe to Hieruſalem, they that were of the circumciſion, contended againſt him ſaiyng: why wentest thou in to ſuche as were not circumciſed, and diddeſt eate with them?</hi> Againe ſome there were of this mynde, which albeit thought not, that the Panyms ſhould from the felowſhip of the goſpel vtterly be excluded, yet thought they therwith al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that ſuche ſhould not be receiued, vnleſſe they wer like Iewes, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed: as though it ſo were that Chriſt had nede of Moſes lawe, therby as appeareth laboryng to tranſpoſe and alter the glory of Chriſtes goſpel in
<pb facs="tcp:7459:15"/>
to the glory of theyr owne nacion. Agreable with this is that whiche is wryten in the .xi. chapiter of thactes, <hi>when it is ſayd, that ſuche, as for the perſecucion enſewyng ſhortely vpon Stephens death were fledde into Phaenicia, Cipres, and Antioche, preached Chriſt to none, but to Jewes onely.</hi> Againe in the .xv. chapiter, <hi>certaine Jewes came to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioche, whiche openly preached againſt Paule and Barnabas, that men were without hope of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, if they were not, (as Moſes lawe teacheth) circumciſed.</hi> By meane whereo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> there was luche a commocion ſtirred vp that it was by a commen counſail de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed and appointed, that Paule and Barnabas with theyr aduerſaries ſhould repayre vnto Ieruſalem, to the entent that there this contencion might by the Apoſtles and elders arbitrement be determined, where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine through the vehement and contencious labour of ſome, of ſuche ſpecially, as were of Phariſeis become chriſtians, of whiche ſecte Paule himſelf was too, there was called a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel of Apoſtles &amp; elders, wherin by the authoritie of Peter &amp; James it was decreed, that the Gentiles ſhould not be burdained with the obſeruaunces of Moſes lawe, but onely ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from eatyng of ſtrangled beaſtes, from bloud, from fleſhe offered to idols, and from fornicacion, whiche pointes were for a tyme onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended vpon, by reaſon of the great and ſtubburne ſcrupuloſitie of the Iewes, as by this it doeth wel appeare, that we now ſee, that thre of them are in theſe dayes vtterly taken away and aboliſhed. Vpon this occaſion aroſe alſo y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> notable and famouſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tencion at Antioche betwene Peter &amp; Paule what tyme Paule the Gentiles Apoſtle ſeyng his flocke through Peters diſſemblyng to be in ieopardye reproued him openly, as himſelfe in the ſeconde chapiter of his epiſtle to the Galathians wryteth. Againe at Ieruſalem by the counſel of Iames to pourge the rumour than ſpread among the Iewes, for that he ſemed to drawe men backe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Moſes law, he with other of his company ſhaued him ſelf, and beyng purified as the Iewes cuſtome was, made his oblacion in the temple, as Luke in the .xxi chapiter of thactes reherſeth. By the whiche place it appeareth, that Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, albeit he before had enfraunchiſed the Gentiles, welnigh from the burdaine of Moſes lawe, abode ſtyll yet in this opinion, that the Iewes ſhould be bounde to the obſeruacion of the whole lawe, if it were for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng els, but to appeace ſuche as had not yet ſo far profited in the truth of the goſpel, that they could be content to deſpiſe theyr aunceſtres rites and vſages. For ſo ſpeaketh Iames: <hi>and all ſhall knowe, that thoſe thinges, whiche they haue heard concernyng the, are falſe: but that thou thyſelfe alſo walke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And for the ſame cauſe (I wene) ſhaued he his head at Cenchris accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng vnto his vowe, as appeareth in the .xviii. chapiter. And for like conſideracion cauſed he Timothe to be circumciſed, as we reade in the xvi. chapiter, whiche yet had in deede a Iewe to his mother, when that his father was a Gentile. Suche a difficultie was it to make of a Iewe a chriſtian.</p>
               <p>This nacion beyonde all other hadde a ſpeciall vntowardnes, nor was there euer founde any, that more ſtiffely abode in theyr religion, as
<pb facs="tcp:7459:16"/>
Ioſephus wryteth in his boke of the defence of the Iewes antiquitie. Moreouer as the Iewes were eſpecially hated of al people of the world, to of theyr ſyde abhorred they againe al other nacions, as vncleane, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and deuiliſhe, ſo farrefoorth that they diſdained to talke with them, who thought alſo y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> their temple was vtterly ſuſpended, if any vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed had entered there into. Suche proude lookes had they for a lytle ſkynnes paryng of.</p>
               <p>Foraſmuche as therefore there was no likelyhode, that the Grecians and Romaines would receiue ſuche an odious lawe, and that the Iewes on theyr ſide helde on ſtyl, Paule fearyng leſt by ſuche deadly contencion and ſtrife a great parte of the fruite of the goſpel might periſhe &amp; be loſt, leſt alſo the glory of Chriſt might by minglyng of Moſes name be dark<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned and defaced, in euery place ſpecially laboreth vtterly to abrogate &amp; aboliſhe the ceremonies of the lawe, and to perſuade them that all aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of attainyng ſaluacion is through Chriſt onely. And as he ſharpely, but yet louyngly, rebuketh the Galathians, for that they fell backe to Iewiſhnes againe: ſo doeth he prepare &amp; fortifie the Romaines, leſt they might elswyſe vnware through falſe Apoſtles be ſnared, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he wel wyſt, neuer ceaſſed, eftſones encouragyng the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtyl to continue in that doctrine, whiche they had once begunne heartely to enbrace and fauor.</p>
               <p>There was at Rome a great noumbre of Iewes, whether they were brought thether by Pompeius Magnus who ſpoyled Hieruſalem, and made them captiues, orels whether it were becauſe the prouince of Iury appertained to the Romaines, it is vncertaine, but ſure it is that theyr ſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perſticion is by Horace, Iuuenale, and Senec oftymes reproued. With them alſo was Paule after his comyng to Rome muche troubled, as in the laſt chapiter of thactes of the Apoſtles it doeth plainely appeare. Paule therfore like a runnyng crafteſman with a wonderfull diſcrecion tempereth his tale betwene theſe two people, the Iewes (I ſay) and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, labouryng by all meanes poſſible to allure them vnto Chriſt, as muche as in them lay procuryng that noman at al ſhould periſhe to that capitaine, whoſe ſouldiar he was.</p>
               <p>One whyle therfore chydeth he one ſorte, another whyle, another, and anone after againe comfortably encourageth them bothe. The Gentiles pride he abated, declaryng, that neither the lawe of nature, nor their Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie, wherof they were ſo proude, auayled them ſo, but that they fell netheleſſe into all kyndes of miſchief. Checkyng againe and reprouyng the Iewes arrogant myndes, whiche through theyr affiaunce in the law had loſt the chiefe grounde therof, that is to wete, fayth in Ieſus Chriſt, he teacheth them, that the ceremonies of Moſes lawe are aboliſhed through the bright beames of the goſpell of Chriſt, whom the ſhadowes of the lawe rudely repreſented, with diuers other thynges, as the reſte of the ſabboth day, the diſpleaſure and paine of circumci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

theyr choyſe of meates, makyng foule agayne the bathes euerie daye, the boucherye of hurtles beaſtes, the religion of their temple, polluted with continuall ſlaughter of beaſtes, and that all theſe darke ſhadowes at the lyght of the truthe appearing vaniſhed awaye, and that ſuche onlye are Abrahams chyldren as expreſſe Abrahams fayth, that ſuche are the righte and trewe Iewes, as profeſſe Chriſtes name, and that they were verelye circumciſed, whoſe myndes were clenſed from filthy deſyers. That true iuſtice alſo &amp; perfite bliſſe is equally gyuen to al people through the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell and onlye faythe in Chriſte wythoute helpe of the lawe, and that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wythſtandyng that ſaluacyon was ſpecially promyſed vnto the Iewes, yet was it ſo promyſed vnto them, that theyr owne Prophetes letted not to prophecye, that the ſame ſaluacion beyng refuſed by the Iewes, the preachyng of Chriſtes goſpell ſhould be ſpreade abrode among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, that no man throughe Moyſes lawe, whom the Iewes carnally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, obtayned ryghteouſnes, but throughe faythe, as he proueth as well by the example of Abraham, as alſo by diuerſe teſtimonies of the lawe. And after that when he hath by this meanes abated y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> pryde of both partes, by taking away this theyr vayne confidences, in the profeſſion of the goſpel, he maketh them equalle in ſuche ſorte ioyous of the Gentiles ſaluacion, that yet lyke a tender father he bewayleth the blyndnes of hys owne countreye men, whome toward hym, alwayes he founde moſte ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and ſo he doeth mitigate this matier, whyche was of it ſelfe harde, that he ſayeth, that all were not blynded: promiſyng that the tyme ſhould come, when they ſhould be of a better mynde, &amp; amend, beyng through the faith of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Gentiles prouoked ſo to do. And here by the way toucheth Paul manye highe &amp; dyuerſe poyntes of doctrine, as of predeſtinacion, of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleage, of vocacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of grace and merites, of fre wyll, of the vnſearche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able counſell of god, of the lawe of nature, of Moſes lawe, and of the law of ſynne.

And deſyreth the Romaines for a ſeaſon to beare with the Iewes infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whiche by reaſon of long cuſtome in the lawe, was rooted in them, and on the other ſyde he requireth the Iewes, not to enuye at the Gentiles cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the grace of the goſpell, but rather with godly mynde to folow their fayth &amp; chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> libertie, wyllyng them, ſynce y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> there is but one God of al, one Chriſte, one grace, &amp; one rewarde to growe all into one bodye, &amp; that none arrogantlye preſume and take vpon hym, but yf he haue anye gyfte, wherin he ſurmounteth other to applye the ſame to the helpe of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. This place handleth ſaincte Paule diuerſlye inſtructyng theim, howe they ſhould vſe themſelfe towarde ſuperſticious chriſtians, or as he calleth them, weake and feble, howe towarde theyr ſuperioures, &amp; howe to their inferioures and felowes, towarde heathen princes and magiſtrates, after a ſorte yet doyng theyr duties, and to be ſhorte, howe they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue themſelfe in proſperitie, and howe in aduerſitie. After whiche ſharpe monicion, he apeaſeth the matier with the Romaines prayſe, and auaunceth his authoritie, and doth them to witte, how muche more he had promoted the ghoſpell, than other, ſhewyng what a deſyer he hadde to ſee them, promiſing, that he woulde come thither, and what lette he had, and why he was compelled to differ it, prayſing the fre liberalitie of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians and Corinthians beſtowed vpon the poore and deuoute people, couertlye, and as it wer with a reuerence prouokyng the Romaines to do the lyke.

               <p>Finally, becauſe he throughly knewe, aſwell the malapert wylynes of the falſe Apoſtles, as alſo the readie ſimplicitie of the Romaines, efte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones he biddeth them to beware of their fayre ſpeache.</p>

But as profitable as this epiſtle is, yet hath it aſmuche, or welnygh more difficultie, than profite, whiche principally happeneth for thre cauſes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through the confoundyng of the right order of ſpeache, or els by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of long ſentences not well hangyng together, or finallye, for that the ſame are oftetymes, as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maye ſaye, entriked or entangled, and not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finiſhed but imperfect, ſo that therupon Origen expoundyng this epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle many tymes complayneth, here and there laboryng and wraſtlyng w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuche difficulties. Whether this happened throughe Tercius, which was ſainct Paules ſcribe, or els through Paule hymſelfe, or throughe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, let therin other men be iudges, certaynly Paule hymſelf confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his rudenes of ſpeache, albeit he denie, that he is ignoraunt, touching knowledge. And beſyde this, ſo far was he from ſekyng for ſuche piked ſpeache, as in any parte ſauered worldly curioſitie. y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he thought the ſame dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to be forborne &amp; auoyded, leſte any parte of the glorie of Chriſtes croſſe myght therby be deminiſhed. And for this cauſe Origen thinketh it labour loſte for any man in his wrytinges to loke for eloquence. Hierome in ſome place graunteth, that he had the arte and craftie ſetting of wordes and ſentences together, &amp; in ſome place denieth it agayne, ſaiyng &amp; affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming plainly, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> his language was greatly corrupted, by the rude people of Cilicia, where he was brought vp. But Auſten out of Paules epiſtles gathereth floures and ornamentes of Rhetoricke. Yea and in the actes of the apoſtles he is called, <hi>chiefe capitaine of the vvorde,</hi> and in his fyrſt epiſtle to the Corinthians he ſayeth of hymſelfe, <hi>that he ſpake vvith languages aboue all other.</hi> And albeit (as ſainct Hierome ſayeth) at the ſame tyme all the Eaſte parte of the worlde vſed the Greke toungue, lykely yet is it, that as the frenche men had not ſuche puritie of the Latine ſpeache, as was vſed in the citie of Rome, ſo might there well be a great difference betwene one of Cilicia and another of Athens, ſpeakyng or wrytyng Greke.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7459:18"/>Beſyde all theſe difficulties there is another, aryſyng through the Hebrue ſpeache, whoſe properties Paule almoſte in euery place vſeth, ſo wrytyng in Greke, that yet a man maye by his wrytyng know, that he was a Iewe. The ſecond cauſe of difficultie is through the darkenes of ſuche matiers, as cannot clearely be expreſſed, becauſe none other epiſtle is there more in tricate and entermedled with deeper priueye miſteries, inſomuche, that Paule hymſelfe ſometyme leauyng his purpoſed matier, is compelled to make exclamacion, and ſaye: <hi>O the deapnes of treaſures.</hi> Yea, &amp; for the nonce ſometyme ſo toucheth he ſome miſteries, that he only ſheweth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a far of, temperyng his oracio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accordyng to the tymes, and as theyr capacities ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued, to whome he wrote. He lawe and knewe certayne thynges, whiche myghte be tolde to noman, knowyng well how farfurth his diſciples, had nede of lyght meate, as mylke is, or of ſtrong foode, &amp; therwith alſo knew he the degrees of ages in Chriſte, and what was for euerie age meete. So dyd the apoſtle Peter alſo, when he ſhoulde preache to the rude people, Chriſte, whome without any mencion makyng of his godhed, he calleth a man. The thyrde cauſe of difficultie maketh (I weene) the often and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den chaunge of perſones, whyles he one whyle hath regard of the Iewes, ſpeakyng in their perſons, another while of the Gentiles, ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tyme of bothe parties, nowe the ryght beleuers, and then the faythles, takyng vpon him ſumtyme the weake, ſumtyme the ſtrong perſones parte, ſumtyme of the godly, and ſumtyme of the vngodly. By meane wherof it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe, that the reader wandering vppe and downe, as it wer in wrenches, or (as ſome call it) in a miſmaſe diuerſly tournyng and wyndyng, neither ſeeth, where he came in, nor yet wel knoweth, which waye to go out. Inſomuche that Origen both truly, and properly (me ſeameth) lykeneth Paule to a man, which bryngeth his frende into a very riche princes palace, by tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng of wayes &amp; ſecrete chambers very doubtfull and cumberouſe, and ſheweth hym the great treaſures and heapes of goodes ſumwhat a farre of, and ſome thinges ſetteth before his iyen and would haue ſum thinges not ſene at all, oftetymes when he went in by one doore, he goeth out at another, ſo that the ſtraunger his frende maruayleth, whence he came, where he is, and whiche waye to get out. This knew alſo ſainct Peter in his ſeconde epiſtle, ſaying: that there wer in Paules epiſtles certayne pointes harde to be vnderſtanden, which the vnlearned, and vnſtable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to theyr owne deſtruccion. Herein haue we, aſmuche as in vs laye, labored to exclude ſuche difficulties, ſauyng that ſumthynges ſo peculiarly belong to Paules tou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue, that in ſome places they could not be chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged, of whiche ſorte theſe be, fayth, grace, the body, the fleſhe, the members, the ſpirite, the mynde, the ſence, to edifie, with ſuche other lyke, whiche as they ſhould not vtterly be chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged, ſo haue we labored to molifie the hardnes of them, aſmuche as myght be. But now let vs heare Paule hymſelf ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng to the Romaynes, or rather in them more groſſely and playnlye to vs all.</p>

                     <p>Now as Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſerued neither for kepyng of Moſes law, whiche was not at that tyme geuen, nor for his circumciſions ſake, whiche (as I before ſayd) he had not yet receiued, that God ſhould make him ſuche ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable promiſes, that is to wete, that the dominion of the whole worlde ſhuld by inheritau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce fal vnto him, or to his poſteritie, but through fayth wherby he deſerued to be called righteous: no more ſhuld the Iewes loke to enioye the ſayd right of Goddes promiſe, either by the onely title and right of circumciſion, or of the lawe either.

For where offences are and diſpleaſures are borne, as it is with them, which are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the lawe, there is there for chyldren no inheritaunce dew. But nowe &amp; yf any man aſke how the lawe rather worketh gods diſpleaſure &amp; wrathe than righteouſnes, beholde, this wyſe it is. Experience ſheweth, that it is vnlawfull to condemne another man as gyltye, vnles by ſome law fyrſte made there be a penaltie of conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nacion proclamed and appoynted. But ſo was it that in Moſes lawe were there diuerſe thynges commaunded to be done or not done, as for example circumciſion, the Sabboth daye ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng, feaſtes of the newe Moone, the differences of meates, touchyng of deade bodyes, of ſtrangled beaſtes, of bloude, of waſhynges, al which are of this ſorte that though we neuer ſo diligentlye obſerue them, yet make they vs not righteouſe, and yet is ſuche one as dothe in theſe offende, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daungered and ſubiecte to punyſhment. But now becauſe by this law no man is bounde, but ſuche as are Iewes, and foraſmuche as to Abraham was promyſed the enheritaunce of all nacions, well foloweth it, that by the ryght and kepyng of the carnal law, the promiſe of god can not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued into all nations, and then foloweth it that by fayth is this inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce obteined, and goddes pleaſure is it ſhould ſo be, to thentent that men ſhould knowe, that it is a gyfte gyuen by goddes free mercy and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and of no debte.

Paule alreadye receaued the goſpelle, yet remayned there in them ſome leauynges of theyr former lyfe, and properties, inſomuche that it was to be feared, leſte they mighte from true chriſtianitie be withdrawen, either by Philoſophers, who diſdayned the preachyng of Chriſtes croſſe, as a baſe, and an vnlearned doctrine, or els by falſe Apoſtles prouokyng them to Iewiſhnes. Suche a harde matier is it, to alter and chaunge one man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a newe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, bothe from ſuche cuſtomes, as the ſame was borne vnder, and from ſuche as a man hath been nozeled in. Yea ſo harde is it, that ſaynt Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, in the preface of the ſecond booke of his comentaries vpon the Epiſtle to the Galathians ſayeth, that ſome ſuche faultes, as Paule layeth to the Corinthians charge, remayned in the people of Achaia euen vntil his time. And in this our time alſo ſome ſuppoſe, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> to be but dipped in a litle water, is a ſufficient meane to make a perfect chriſtian man. Paule therfore knowyng well, that it is as great an acte to bolde that, whiche is once gotten, as it is to conquere: with as great laboure and payne as he had gotten his children to Chriſte, (for he was among them a yeare and a halfe) with like diligence he calleth them agayne to Chriſte, and eſtabliſheth them in the doctryne of the ghoſpell: ſometyme vſyng his apoſtolique authoritie, reprouyng them, chiding, and thretning: ſometime like a louing father ſpeaking fayre, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging, and mollifying the vehemencie of his neceſſarie reprouing, by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of them. And as the maner of a wiſe phiſician is, temperyng ſower and vnpleaſaunt medicines with ſwete ſuger, eftſoues prouiding alſo for euery maladie mete and conuenient reamedies. Firſte, after riches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> foloweth pryde and vurulines. And among vnruly perſones, oftentimes ariſe ſectes, whiles neither will geue place vnto an other, but eche man thinketh hymſelfe beſte. Beſides this, welthines bringeth ryot and delicate fare. And of riot gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth leachery. And to be couetous, is a thing geuen peculiarly to marchante men. Nor were the Corinthians proude onely by reaſon of there welthe, but alſo becauſe they were learned in the grecians philoſophy, and therfore deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoiſed they ſuche, as were not learned therein, as rude and barbarouſe. Of pride it came, that euery of them auaunced hymſelfe vpon the ſingularnes of that Apoſtle, of whome he was baptiſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7459:65"/>Therof roſe theſe ſediciouſe wordes, I holde of Apollo, I holde of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas, I hold of Paule. Of pryde alſo it came that in their ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne aſſemblies and meetynges, they diſagreed amonge them ſelfes, becauſe euery manne thought his ſpiritual gifte beſte: and whiles in one gyfte neither woulde gyue place to other, there was ſuche diſordre and confuſion, ſo that euen theyr wemen in open places both ſpoke and taughte. Of ryot and pryde alſo was it, that as ofte as they came to the holye ſupper, whiche Paule calleth the Lordes ſupper, wherin it were moſte mete to ſhewe chriſtian concord, the ryche men without lokynge for the poore, fell to their meate, and gorged the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues vntill they were drounke whiles other were hungrye: inſomuche as at that ſupper, there was not only diſſencion and diſtemperaunce, but alſo a certayne vnſeemyng inequalitie, not accuſtomed to bee vſed in that ſupper. And where as ſome among them dyſdayned Paule, countyng hym but a poore raſcalle, lackynge eloquence, rude and vnlearned: that roſe partlye through pryde, and partlye through Philoſophie. But wheras they doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the reſurrection of the dead, whiche is euen the pryncipall article and foundacion of our religion, that only came of Philoſophie. Of intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce and riot it came, that they vſed indifferently to eate ſuche meates, as than were offered to ymages of dyuelles, without regardyng of theyr con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, which were weake. Of Leacherye it came, whiche was in no place leſſe puniſhed than in Corinthe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo farre that beſide other enormyties in thys kynde, there was one found among them, which had in inceſtuouſe aduou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, abuſed his fathers wyfe, that is to wytte, his owne ſteppe mother, nor was, beyng giltie of ſuch an offence, banyſhed out of their company: ſo that the Corinthians kept company with him and other chriſtian menne, which were outragiouſe liuers, as though thei had euen fauered theyr wickednes. Of like wantones came this alſo, that the men vnſemely had long buſhes, &amp; their women were not a ſhamed in the church to be bare headed, by their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dylye aparayle vtteryng their lewed womannyſhe, and wanton maniers. Of couetouſnes was it, that they went to lawe one with another, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer their good name, nor for auoyding anye bodyly ieoperdye, but for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g whom the deſyre of money was growen ſo far, that chriſtian men, which had vowed the deſpiſyng of ſuche thinges, not without the great dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of Chriſtes name, went to the lawe before heathen &amp; wicked iudges: &amp; were ſo farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſpiſyng the loſſe of a litle money, that in ſuche matiers they went aboute wilfullye to deceaue other. Finallye they ſtryued among them ſelues of matrimonye, by reaſon that euen at that tyme ſome chriſtian men ſtyflye defended, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould wholy abſtayne from mariage, becauſe they ſawe the Apoſtles abſtayne from their wyues. And thus haue I decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the dyſeaſes of the Corynthians, not of all, but of ſome, by whome leſte the reſt myght be infected, Paule prouideth theſe reamydies. Firſt of al, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he hath told them of his truſt, that they would ſtedfaſtly contynewe in the goſpel of Chriſt, he earneſtlye reproueth and byddeth them beware, &amp; not contenciouſly to glorie in men, but with one aſſent and concorde to glory in Chriſtes name, whom men are bounde to thanke for all that we haue: by the waye declaryng, that the verye welſpryng of al ſuche diſſention is pryde. From pride therfore through worldly Philoſophie, he calleth them backe to the mekenes of the croſſe, which albeit it be ſymple and without all bragges, yet ſayth he that it is myghty and effectual.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:7459:65"/>And then ſheweth he alſo, that the beginners of this miſchief, were falſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, whiche after Paules departure thruſt themſelues in, eftſones warning them, howe he had layed a good and ſure foundacion, and that thei ſhould take hede, leſte they builded any thing therupon, which ſhould afterward be plucked downe: that is to ſay, that the Corinthians ſhould learne nothing which they ſhould anone after be fayne to forgette. After that, like a father he reaſoneth the matter with his children, reprouyng in them, that they were growen ſo great, that they no we deſpiſed their firſte teacher, as an abiect perſon, &amp; becauſe that he for the goſpels ſake had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred al maner of troubles, whom for theſame thei were much more bound to fauer. After which, he encourageth his children to folow the ſteppes of their father, and not wilfully to yelde them ſelfe to be bounde to newe ſcholemaiſters. And theſe poyntes intreateth Paul of ſpecially, in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> firſte, the ſecound, the third &amp; the fourth Chapters. Now in myne opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the end of the fourth Chapter, belongeth to the begynnyng of the fyfte. Wherein he gyueth commaundement touchyng the inceſtuouſe aduoutrer, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth by commen conſent, that men ſhould auoyde his company: partly that he might amende for ſhame, and partly leſte by his company other myght be corrupted, not onely warning the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to auoyde his company, but alſo the company of all ſuche, which beyng called after a ſorte chriſtian men, lyue viciouſly, and ſlaunderouſly. As for the company of Paynims (he ſayth) nedeth not ſo muche to be auoyded, eyther becauſe it lytle belongeth to chriſtians, what lyfe they leade, or els becauſe, that ſuche were ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men, that if a man would auoyde theyr company, he ſhould be able to be in no company at all. And this entreateth he of in the fyfte Chapter. Thrydely he ſheweth his mynde concernyng ſutes of the lawe, that if among them, any ſuche accion roſe, as it were a ſhame there ſhould among chriſtians, to ſtryue for money, which menne ſhould lytle ſette by, that they ſhould not ſuffer the matter to goe ſo farre, as to haue it hearde before heathen iugdes, but to finiſhe it among themſelfes, by the arbitremente of any ſuche, as they thought mete. And this entreateth he of in the ſixt Chapter, whereof a great parte, in myne opinion, belongeth to the ſeuenth, euen from that place, where he being aboute to entreate of matrimonie, among other vices condemneth fornicacion, aduoutrye, and buggorie: and this matter proſecuteth he, vntill the beginnyng of the nexte Chapter, where he ſayeth: knowe ye not that your membres are the Temple of Chriſte? Fourthly he inſtructeth them touchyng matrimonie, wydowhead, vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall mariage, diuorces, virginitie: by the way warnyng, that for chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religions ſake, they ſhould not goe aboute to chaunge the ciuile ſtate of theyr lyfe. In all which treatyſe he ſo encourageth them to ſingle lyfe and chaſtitie, that yet he denieth not the reamydie of mariage, to ſuche as haue nede therof: and this doth he in the ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th Chapter. Fiftly he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that the fleſh offred to Idolles, in very dede, nothing differeth from other, and yet muſt we abſtayne from them, if any ieopardy be, leſte any heathen or weake chriſtian be preſent, which by reaſon of thyne eatyng is lyke to thynke, that thou fauoureſt Idolatry. From ſuche and other lyke vices, diſſuadeth he by olde examples.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7459:66"/>And this doeth he in the eight and in parte of the nineth Chapter. For in the myddes he entreth into the prayſe of himſelfe, couertly auauncyng his authoritie aboue other Apoſtles, euen aboue the chiefe of them, which only among all the reſt freely taught the Corinthians the doctryne of the goſpell. Sixtly teacheth he what were mete to be done in the comen me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges of chriſtians, that is to witte, that the menne ſhould not haue long heare, nor the women be bare headed, and that alſo in the Lordes ſouper, all thinges ſhould be commen and equall, ſhewyng them, that it was no bealy matter, that there was in hande, whiche were more mete to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for at home, but in that ſpirituall feaſt, was repreſented the ſouper of the Lorde. Furthermore he warneth that none of them be proude for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpirituall gyfte, but that euery of them ſhould beſtowe his gyfte for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men weale of the churche, exhortyng them by the exaumple of the membres of the body, ſoberly to vſe other gyftes, ſpecially yet laboring for the gifte of charitie, without whom other are not onely not good, but alſo hurtful. So that among the gyftes of the ſpirite, he geueth the chiefe preeminence to charitie, and the nexte to prophecie, for by that name cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth he the gyfte of expoundyng holy ſcripture, biddyng them in the vſe of this gyfte, to auoyde all vnquiet diſordre and confuſion. As he ſayth they ſhould, if but fewe ſpake at once, and that by courſe, chargeing their wemen in the meane ſeaſon to holde their peace, in ſomuche that in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregacion he ſuffreth not them to aſke, no not for their learnyng. All this ſpeaketh he of in the. xi. xii. xiii. and .xiiii. Chapters. Seuenthly, with dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe argumentes he proueth the reſurreccion of the dead, declaring how and after what maner it ſhalbe: and this doeth he in the .xv. Chapter. In the laſt Chapter ſpeaketh he of certayne familiar thinges: that is to wit, of geuyng of money towarde the reliefe of the poore, and of his cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng agayne to Corynthe. And finally he commendeth vnto them Timothe and certayne other. Saincte Ambroſe thinketh that this is not the firſte Epiſtle, that Saincte Paul wrote to the Corinthians, coniecturing ſo, as I thinke, by that is written in the firſte Chapter: I wrote vnto you in an Epiſtle, as though he had before written vnto them of theſe matters in other letters, albeit the Greke interpreters diſſente. Some thynke that this Epiſtle was ſente by Tim othe, becauſe of him mencion is made once or twyes, and by Stephana, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, whom he commendeth vnto them. Some againe, becauſe it is wrytten at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ende, I will tary at Epheſus vntill the fiftyeth daye, ſuppoſe, that it was ſent from Epheſus. Some againe thinke that it was ſent from Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippos, for that title haue the Greke bookes. And yet ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not I coniecture, with what reaſon they were ledde, that ſo thought, onleſſe they gather, that it was written by the waye, becauſe Paul ſayeth: I wyll come to you, when I go ouer to Macedonia: for I will go through Macedonia. And ſtraight after: for I will not ſee you no we in my paſſage.</p>

And we haue not receyued the ſpirite of the worlde: but the ſpirite whiche commeth of god, for to knowe the thynges that are geuen to vs of God, whiche thynges alſo we ſpeake not with wordes that mannes wiſedome teacheth: but with wordes which the holy ghoſt doeth teache, makyng ſpirituall compariſons of ſpirituall thinges. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man perceyueth not the thynges that belong to the ſpirite of god. For they are but folyſhnes vnto hym. Neyther can he perceyue them, becauſe they are ſpiritually exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But he that is ſpirituall, diſcuſſeth all thynges: yet he hymſelfe is iudged of no man.

Whiche ſpirite, becauſe it is of goddes nature, and proceadyng from god, ſearcheth foorth euen the deapeſt and mooſte ſecrete priuities of God, wherunto mannes buſye brayne attayneth not. Euery man may eaſily loke on an other mans face, but what lieth hidden in the bottome of the hert, that is no man able to ſee, for that onely knoweth the ſpirite of god, and a mans owne conſcience. After like ſorte diuers men beholde and ſearch out the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of goddes creatures: but ſuch thinges as lye hidden in goddes coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and prouidence, no body knoweth ſauing his euerlaſtyng ſpirite, whiche beyng of one nature with hym, knoweth all ſuche thynges, as he doeth.

It beſemeth ſurely, that ſpirituall learnyng ſhould haue a ſpirituall hearer, which hath bothe his vnderſtandyng cleanſed by faythe, and wylfull deſyres corrected by charitie. For the groſſe, and naturall man, whiche is proude and arrogant vpon the knowledge of thinges that maye be ſeene, and is ruled by beaſtly luſtes, regardeth not ſuche thynges as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteyne to the ſpirite of god, but coumpteth for folyſhnes and laugheth to ſkorne, whatſoeuer ſoundeth contrary to that he thynketh. Nor beleueth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thyng, but that he hath eyther proued by experyence, or concluded by natural reaſon, and is without regarde of this learnyng and Phyloſophie, whiche teacheth, that Chriſte was borne of a virgyn, and that he was bothe very god and very man, that by dying he ouercame death, and after roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne to lyfe, and wyll perfourme in his membres ſuche thynges, as are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready doen in hymſelfe, that tribulacions are the waye to true blyſſe, and that by death a man ſhall come to euerlaſtyng lyfe.

For al thinges are yours, whether it be Paul, either Apollo, either Cephas: whether it be the worlde, either lyfe, either death, whether they be preſente thynges, or thynges to come: all are youres and ye are Chriſtes, and Chriſte is Gods.</q>

                     <q>Theſe thinges (brethren) I haue for an enſample deſcribed in myne owne perſon, and in Apollos for your ſakes: that ye might learne by vs, that no man counte of hymſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde  that whiche is aboue wrytten: that one ſwell not agaynſt an other for any mannes cauſe. For who preferreth the? What haſte thou, that thou haſt not receyued? yf thou haue receyued it, why reioyſeſt thou, as though thou haddeſt not receyued it? Nowe ye are full: nowe ye are made ryche: ye raygne as kinges without vs: and I would to God ye dyd raygne, that we myght raygne with you.</q>
                     <p>But to be playne with you, hytherto haue I framed my tale by my ſelfe and by Apollo, not becauſe we are the beginners of any ſuche ſecte, (for neyther take we any thyng vpon vs, and among you none is there, that braggeth hymſelfe to bee of Paules ſecte or of Apollos) but becauſe I perceyued, that there are among you diuerſe fauourers of diuerſe ſectes: leſte ſome myght haue been prouoked to impaciencie, I thought it beſte in fayned names to ſette furth the matter, that when this Epiſtle ſhoulde be read openly among you, euery man myght ſecretly examine his owne conſcience. And ſo is this matter, which would elſwiſe haue cauſed much ſpyte and hatred, opened in our names, that ye maye quietly perceyue, howe vncomely certayne of you triumphe and braggue vpon the names, of falſe Apoſtles, and deſpiſe euery man in compariſon of themſelfe, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renderyng vngodly that vnto menne, whiche is dewe to God: whiche for none other purpoſe exalte eche of them for their parte the dignitie of their owne Apoſtle, but becauſe themſelfes would be had in greater eſtimaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, iudgyng in this euen as folyſhlye of themſelfe, as of them, in whoſe behalfe they doe arrogantly braggue and crake. Theſe thynges perhaps myght be ſuffred, yf they were onely folyſhe, but now ſyth by them dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly debates aryſe, the matter cannot bee cloked. Ye ought not to eſteme menne, that ſupply the Apoſtles office, but as reaſon would that ſtewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and beſt wars of other mennes goodes, ſhould be regarded, nor ſhould any manne crake in this mannes name or that, ſynce all that they doe, is of God.

Though ye chaunce to haue, yea ten thouſande ſcholemaiſters, ſurely ye ſhall fynde but fewe of them to be fathers. And whye ſhoulde I not call my ſelfe a father, and you my chyldren? ſith I fyrſte of all menne preached the goſpell vnto you, and ſyth that throughe me ye are borne agayne vnto Chriſte? Haue not I in maner begoten you? What mother hathe taken ſo muche payne in trauaile with her childe, as I ſuffered, when I trauailed with you to make you chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans?<note place="margin">Wherefore I deſire you to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe me, as I folowe Chriſte.</note> Wherfore yf ye acknowledge this father to be yours, yf ye be vnfayned children, I beſeche you for our mutuall loues ſake, to folowe your father in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and manners. Synce ye are begoten by vs, why labour ye rather to bee lyke other, than to vs? Suche thynges, wherof ye ate accuſed vnto me, whence they came, conſider with your ſelfe, ſurely ye learned not them of me. Yf any poynte of our doctryne bee out of youre memorie, foraſmuche as I canne not come my ſelfe, here I ſende vnto you Timothee, euen as mine owne ſelfe, which is my ſonne, not one that groweth out of kynde, but through goddes goodnes a faythful childe, which as fyrſte by me he learned Chriſte, ſo ſwarueth he at no tyme from his fathers ſteppes. He ſhal put you in remembraunce, how I ordre my life, whiche I bothe folowe and teache after the example of Ieſus Chriſte, not vnto you onely, but to euery congregacion, that profeſſeth Chriſte. As he is one commen autour and rewler of all, ſo muſte all menne haue one rewle of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng. A naturall childe doth his duety, not for feare of payne, but gladlye and with all his hearte. There are ſome among you, whiche becauſe I am abſente, are paſte ſhame, and ſo wantonly behaue them ſelfes as though I would neuer returne. But they ſhalbe deceyued, for I wyll within a whyle bee with you, by goddes grace, what tyme I wyll haue a tryall what theſe menne can doe, that this wyſe auaunce them ſelfe, not in eloquence, but in deedes. For the ſtrength of<note place="margin">The kin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome of God is not in wordes.</note> the goſpell ſtandeth not in royall and gorgiouſe ſpeache, which euerye manne maye bſe, but in a heauenlye ſtrengthe and power, which is declared by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feraunce of troubles, by concorde, by ryghteouſneſſe of the wholle lyfe, and by myracles.

Whoſoeuer profeſſeth Chriſte, profeſſeth Innocencie, and to ſuch a lyfe is promiſed the kyngdome of heauen. For neyther is it ſufficient to bee dipped in water, nor yet to bee graffed into Chriſte, onleſſe all youre life bee agreable to Chriſtes doctryne. And for none other purpoſe are ye taken out of this world, and planted into the body of Chriſt, but to the ende ye ſhould hencefurthe in godlye lyfe bee lyke vnto Chriſte youre heade.

Fyrſte of all therefore, for many cauſes, as the time no we requireth, it wer well doen of men wholy for this cauſe to abſteyne from theyr wyues, that they maye with more freedome applye Chriſtes goſpell, and godly lyfe. For albeit matrimonie be a holy thyng, yet it wrappeth a man, will he or not, in worldlye care, wherein howe muche more laboure is beſtowed, ſomuche the leſſe is god ſerued.

The debte of eche towardes the other is lyke, and when tyme requireth, muſt of both parties be delyuered and payed, as they haue made promiſe. Let the houſebande then geue that, which he by the law of mariage is bounden to geue to his wife. The wife likewyſe geue to her houſebande, that ſhe is by the lawe of wedlocke bounde to geue him.

For among you (as I heare) ſome are there, whiche, albeit denye not but that ye are in a fredome, and maye marrye, yet when one by the deathe of the other is made free, they woulde not haue you mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye agayne. Of theſe doubtes this thinke I. Yf any manne by reaſon of the death of his wyfe become ſingle, or yf anye womanne by reaſon of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes death be wydowe, very well doen were it, if they be able, thencefurth to lyue chaſte, yf neither he ſeeke for a wyfe, nor ſhe for another huſbande, but that bothe dedicate theyr freedome vnto goddes ſeruice. That haue I for myne owne parte choſen whiche I thoughte beſte, becauſe nothing ſhoulde lette me from preachyng gods worde, whiche I ſo hartely fauoure, that for loue thereof I litle ſet by ſuche pleaſures, as are in marriage.</p>
                     <p>Nowe and yf I knewe, that all menne were of theſame mynde, I woulde not lette to call and exhorte euery manne to doe, as I doe. But ſynce the diſpoſicions of mennes myndes and bodyes are ſo vnlyke, vnmeete is it to gyue all menne one kynde of counſell, but in this rather lette euerye manne<note place="margin">If they cannot ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtayne, lette the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> marry: for it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry than to burne.</note> weyghe his owne ſtrengthe, and ſo folowe that kynde of lyfe, whereunto by nature he thynketh hymſelfe mooſt meete. Lette ſuche one, as vpon a profe had of Matrimonie feeleth hymſelfe vnable to reſiſte the violente and burnyng aſſaultes of the fleſhe, rather marrye agayne, that by lawfull ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie he maye remedye his vnchaſtnes, than by lyuyng ſyngle, through the vehemente deſyre of the fleſhe, be in ieopardie of a more grieuouſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:7459:83"/>So that in this neither compel I men to marie, nor yet forbyd mariage, but leaue euery man in fredome to weyghe with hymſelfe, what is expediente.

Suche as are vnmaried, ſtande free, (as I ſaye) either to marie or not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, as they iudge beſt, ſo that in theyr doinges they haue an iye to nothing, but to Chriſtes glorye.

Nowe yf the womanne cannot ſo long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayne her ſelfe, let her diligentlye labour to wynne her huſbandes fauoure agayne. Yf ſhe of her huſbande cannot obtayne ſomuche, lette her aſſure her of this, that with whome ſoeuer ſhe couple herſelfe, theſame knotte maye happely be named mariage, but it is in very dede aduoutcie.</p>

Circumciſion is nothyng, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcſyon is nothyng: but the keping of the commaundementes of God. Let euery man abyde in the ſame callyng, wherin he was called.

Lykewyſe, he that is called beyng fre, is Chriſtes ſeruaunt. Ye are dearly bought, be not ye the ſeruauntes of men. Brethren let euery manne wherin he is called, therin abyde with God.</q>
                     <p>As the Lorde hath geuen euery man, in theſame let hym ſerue Chriſte. In what ſtate of lyuing at the tyme of preachyng the ghoſpell a manne is founde, let hym in theſame continewe. Our newe religion abolyſheth our olde lyfe, but it deſtroyeth not our olde ſtate of lyfe: becauſe chriſtian religion agreeth and ſtandeth with euery condicion of lyfe, nor was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by God to trouble the ciuile policie of the worlde, but to the entente that in euery degree and ſtate of lyfe, euery manne myght lyue therin god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and deuoutly. This is my councell, whiche I not onely teache you, but alſo all other congregacions. Nor ſhall it be for you paynfull to folowe that, whiche euery manne foloweth. Wherfore yf the inſpiracion of Gods holy ſpirite when he calleth, fynde the maryed, breake not therefore thy matrimony: if it fynde the circumciſed, without cauſe art thou, why thou ſhouldeſt loth thy condicion, and ſeke to bee vncircumciſed. For nothyng eyther furdereth or hyndereth vncircumciſion this newe religion. Againe yf theſame fynde the vncircumciſed, no cauſe haſte thou to wyſhe to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed. For as touching this newe religion lytle force maketh it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou be circumciſed or vncircumciſed. But to both ſortes this egally belongeth, that eche lyue henceforth after the commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dementes of God, whoſe rule they haue profeſſed, &amp; not as carnal deſyres moue them.

without diſquietnes and trouble. And as I haue ſayed, that ye ſhoulde doe, being called to god in the ſtate of matrimonie or in the ſtate of circumciſion, euen lyke wyſe muſte ye iudge of the ſtate of bondage. Suche as at the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and receuyng of the goſpell are bonde, let them bee content with theyr fortune, nor thinke themſelues delyueryd from theyr maiſters dominion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are delyuered from the tyranny of ſyn. Agayn the fre man whiche is called to chriſtian religion, hath no cauſe to chaunge his ſtate, and become bonde. But rather let euery man endeuoure, yf occaſion ſerue, to embrace lyberty, and chaunge hys bondage. Yf the maiſter for diſpleaſure borne to Chriſtes name reiecte his ſeruaunt, let the ſame ſeke no newe maiſter, nor yet be at diſpleaſure w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him ſelfe, becauſe he is maiſterles, ſynce he hath Chriſte to his maiſter, whoſe free ſeruaunt he is bee come of a bonde man. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſyde, he that is borne fre, and borne agayne by baptiſme let hym for his ſtate neither bee angrie nor pleaſſed with hym ſelfe, ſynce that through bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme he is become bonde ſeruaunt to Chriſt: ſo that after ſondrye ſortes, the bondman is made fre, and the fremanne made bonde, to thentent that eche of them ſhoulde with more ſobrietie beare theyr fortune. Fredome and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage are ſuch thinges, wherof Chriſte hath in maner no regarde. Embrace the better, yf thou with bondage be oppreſſed, thinke that albeit thy maiſter hath vpon thy bodie a certayne power and authority, yet thy ſoule being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuered from ſynne, is to Chriſte warde fre. Yf thy fredom any thyng make the prowde, remember that thou were bought by Chriſte, and bought for no ſmalle price. Thou haſte a maiſter to be had in all feare and honoure, beware thou phantaſie not, that thou art fre, and mayſt lyue at thy pleaſure. And he that is to anye man bonde, is this farfurthe by Chriſte made fre, that yf hys maiſter commaunde hym to doe any vngodly ſeruice, he is rather bounde to gyue eare to Chriſte hys newe Lorde and maiſter, than to hys olde, whiche by reaſon of abuſe hath loſte his tytle. And yet reaſon it were, that ſuche, as<note place="margin">Ye are dere<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly boughte, be not ye the ſeruauntes of men.</note> Chriſte with the price of his bloud hath made fre, ſhoulde not with any gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſe maiſter be oppreſſed. I fauer lybertie, yf it maye be had. For Chriſtes ſeruice is perfite libertie. That a chriſtian manne ſhoulde ſerue an heathen, ſemeth an vnmete thinge. And reaſon were it, that ſuche as are to a chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian maiſter, ſeruauntes, ſhoulde of them bee fauoured as brethren and chyldren, becauſe bothe haue one comon maiſter, by whome bothe were with one price redeamed. But yet leſte vnder the coloure of chriſtian religion the ſtate of the comon weale bee diſquieted, let euery manne ſuffer hys condicy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therein abyde, and ſo abyde in it, that in the meane ſeaſon he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that goddes commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dementes muſte bee ſet before the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes of menne. Obey youre maiſters, but yet ſo, that god therwith be pleaſed, whiche payed more for you, than they. Suche poyntes, as I haue taught you of freedome and bondage, haue alſo place in the ſtate of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, and ſingle lyfe. For he that is vnder the lawe of matrimonie, is after a ſorte bound. But he that is ſingle, is in a more fre ſtate of lyfe. Therfore menne muſte alwaye folowe that, whiche is more commodiouſe, if it maye be. Yf it maye be, (I ſaye) for we maye not ſo deſyre libertie, that for loue therof we fall into a greater ieopardie.</p>

Thys ſpeake I for youre profyt, not to tangle you in a ſhare: but that ye may folow it which is honeſt, and comely, and that ye maye cleaue vnto the Lorde without ſeparacyon. If any man thinke that it is vncomly for hys virgin, yf ſhe paſſethe tyme of mariage, and yf ſo nede requyre, let hym do what he lyſteth, he ſynneth not: let them be coupled in mariage.

Let ſuch haue wyues, as will, but let them be had without regarde, as though they had none, ſo ſhal the bondage of matrimonie leſſe trouble, and the pleaſures of wedlocke leſſe delyght.</p>
                     <p>Let ſuche, as are with aduerſities oppreſſed, wepe, as though they wepte not. And ſuche as haue this worldely welthe, reioyce, as though thei reioyced not.

Nothing hath this world, but euen ſhadowes of good thynges and badde, wherein nothyng is there, that is eyther ſounde or ſtable, whereunto to bee to muche geuen, is not the purpoſe of ſuche as laboure to lyfe immortall.

And in this behalfe better is the ſtate of the ſingle, than is his, that is maried. For he that is ſingle, is not troubled, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe cares, nether how to pleaſe his father in law, nor how to pleaſe his
<pb facs="tcp:7459:86"/>
mother in lawe, and other aliaunce, nor howe to contente his wyfe and children, howe to prouide neceſſaries for his houſholde dayly encreaſing more and more, nor yet howe to be more worthe, than his wyues dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye was: but holy geueth himſelfe to Chriſte, thinkyng that he hath al his deſyre, yf he onely pleaſe hym. On the otherſyde, albeit that he, whiche is maried, partly ſerue God, yet ſome ſeruice oweth he to his wyfe, and to ſuche thinges as apertayne to matrimonie. And lykewyſe is it in the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, foraſmuche as ſhe is not wholy at her owne libertie, ſhe cannot who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerue Chriſte, but by reaſon that ſhe is diuerſly troubled, partely ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth Chriſte, and partely her houſbande.

But the maried woman muſte nedes betwixte Chriſte and her huſbande deuyde herſelfe, in ſuche ſorte endeuouringe to pleaſe Chriſte, that ſhe yet diſpleaſe not her huſbande, to whome ſhe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth obedience. Nowe this is the ende of all that I haue ſayd, wherin I ſomuche prayſe ſingle life, (leſte any man miſtake it) not to take from you<note place="margin">This ſpeake I for your profite, not to tangle you in a ſnare.</note> the libertie to marie, or not marye, or by neceſſitie to compelle you to anye kinde of lyfe which ye cannot phantaſie, but with frendly counſell to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your weale, that when ye knowe that ye maye frely do ether of both, ye incline thytherwarde and choſe that rather, whiche hath not onlye ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie in it, but alſo therwith libertie annexed, wherby it ſhall be lawfull for the ſingle perſon in ſuche ſorte wholy with all obedience and loue to gyue hym ſelfe to the Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, that no wordly trouble or care ſhalbe able at any time to withdraw him from theſame. But this let eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man vprightly weigh with himſelfe, whether that waye, whiche he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth honorable &amp; free, he thinke the ſame ieopardles, &amp; ſuch as he is diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vnto. For he that feareth leſte he fall into any reproch or infamie, yf he ouer long kepe his daughter a virgine at home being already mariage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp; mynded to theſame, &amp; the matter ſelfe requireth no leſſe, good leaue geue I him to doe, as he ſhal thinke expedient to be done. For albeit, as I ſayed, matrimony haue bondage &amp; care adioyned, yet is it without ſinne, both honeſt and lawfull, &amp; alſo for ſome neceſſary. Let therfore the father in ſyght of the worlde &amp; in ſeaſon prouyde for his daughter a huſbande, leſte ſhe by ſtelth doe that ſhamfully, which done in matrimonie ſtandeth with honeſtie. But yf the father ſeeyng hymſelfe to ſtande in full freedom to mary his daughter or not mary, and not to be compelled to eyther of both partes of neceſſitie, purpoſed and ſurely in his harte decreed to kepe her a virgin ſtyll, in aſmuche as ſhe is not deſyrouſe to be maried, he doth well. For as it is not ieopardles to ſtay and lette one that is of mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age deſyrous, ſo is it not godly to diſcourage a maydens mynde from her loue and godly deſyre of chaſtitie. He therfore whiche for feare of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryll<note place="margin">He that ioyneth his virgine in mariage doeth well.</note> marieth his daughter beyng deſyrouſe of mariage, doeth well. But he that moueth not a maydens minde to mariage, whiche is deſyrouſe to lyue continually chaſte, but is glad to pleaſe the godly deſyre of the may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, doeth better.

to ſerue her ſpouſe Chriſte. For other intent and purpoſe is there none, why any ſhould ſeke for the lybertie of ſingle lyfe. In the ſyght of God a more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable thyng is it, in the ſtate of matrimony to beſtowe in Gods ſeruice as muche tyme as is lefte after neceſſarie buſyneſſe done, than to abuſe the pretence of virginitie, to ryote, idlenes, or licencious ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng. So farre therfore am I from reſtrayning virgines from theyr fyrſt mariage, that wheras the worlde lytle eſtemeth the ſeconde mariage, I let not euen wydowes to marry again. What is for euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> profitable, it belongeth not to me particularly to preſcribe and apoynte. Herein let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man with hymſelfe take aduiſe. What may be doen without offence, that declare I. A virgine may lawfully marry, becauſe ſhe is free. A ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed woman is not in lyke freedome, nor may ſo doe, but hath bounde her ſelfe vnto her huſbande, with the bonde of matrimonie, duryng the tyme of his lyfe. This bonde is by nothyng broken, but by onely death. For whoſoeuer maryeth, for this purpoſe maryeth, that the knotte made in mariage ſhould not be broken. But yf the huſbande dye, then is the wyfe free agayne, ſo that yf ſhe mynde to marry agayne, ſhe may marry whom ſhe wyll, ſo that it be a chriſtian maryage, that is to ſaye, neyther deſyred for filthy pleaſures ſake, nor contracte with one that is of an other religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And yet as I graunt, that ſhe ſynneth not, whiche maryeth agayne: ſo iudge I her muche more happy, whiche for deſyre of godly life ſtandeth and abydeth in the lybertie, that to her is reſtored. But this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde I not them, as neceſſarie to be folowed, but councell it, as a thyng more commodiouſe. And this nowe heare you the councell of a man, but yet ſuch, as is well agreing wyth the wyll of Chriſte, whiche by his owne mouthe teacheth many thynges, and muche alſo by his ſeruauntes.</p>
                     <p>And ſynce I am both his Apoſtle, and haue (as I verely thinke) receyued his ſpirite, as other Apoſtles haue, my councell with you ſhould not be of ſmall weyght and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>

Some there be among you, which becauſe they know, that an idole is nothyng, but eyther tymber, or braſſe, or ſtone, and that therfore the fleſhe, that vnto them is offered, in very dede nothyng diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from other fleſhe, and that a mannes conſcience canne with no kynde of meate bee defiled, abuſyng this theyr knowledge, in euery place, and without conſideracion, engorge and pamper vppe themſelues with fleſh offered to idolles: iudgyng not a myſſe of the matter in dede, but yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gettyng the lawe of charitie, whiche geueth no maunne occaſion of myſſe thynkyng and ſlaundre, but confourmeth herſelfe to ſuche as are weake, vntyll that by lytle and lytle they growe vppe to more knowledge.</p>
                     <p>What greate matter is it, yf they vnderſtande, that an image hath in it no godly power?

Knowledge doeth ofte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes hurte, beyng ſuche a thyng, as maketh a manne to ſwell, and to bee diſdaynfull: but the endeuer of charitie in all tyme and place is to doe good, and hurte no manne. Albeit in very dede, ſuche ſeme to lacke a great parte of knowledge alſo, whiche knowe not, howe to vſe theyr know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. That poynte teacheth charitie, whiche meaſureth and iudgeth all thinges by the weale of his neyghbour. He therfore, that in ſuch thinges as he doeth, will ſeme perfitly learned, muſt call charitie to councell. For he, that without charitie ſwelleth with a vayne perſuaſion that he is learned, is ſo far from knowledge, that he is not come ſo far as to knowe howe he ſhould vſe his knowledge. He that to Godwarde is wyſe, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame man is the very wyſe man in dede. But he that pleaſeth hymſelfe, and ſeketh his owne glory, without regarde of his brothers ieopardie, his learning God alloweth not. But he that vnfaynedly loueth God, muſt alſo loue his neighbour. Such one therfore God acknowledgeth, as his owne diſciple, becauſe that as God humbled his hygh Godhead, to ſaue mankynde: ſo doeth ſuche one ſubmitte his knowledge, and compell it to ſerue the commoditie of his neyghbour. To returne therfore to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed matter: we knowe in maner all, that albeit the Gentyles wurſhyp idoles, as though in them there were ſome diuine power, and Godhead,<note place="margin">We are ſure that an image is nothyng.</note> yet is an idole in dede nothing els, but either a piece of tymber, or a ſtone, and hathe nomore Godhead in it, than an other vnſquared piece of tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or an vnwrought ſtone, and therfore in the fleſhe that to them is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, there is nomore goodnes or hurte, than is in ſuche, as is ſolde in the ſhambles.

miſerable people offer vnto in ſtede of god? Theſe men therfore are defiled with ſuche meates, whiche receyue them as holy, whereas they bee vnholye and prophane. As for chriſtians ſuche fleſhe defileth not, whiche eate them not, as holye, but vſe them, as creatures made by god, to apeaſe hunger. And vſe them for ſuſtenaunce, and not for deuocion, with hymſelf laughing at the folyſhe rable of heathen goddes, beeyng fullye perſwaded, that there is no god, but one, to whome all thynges are holye. For albeit ſome there be, whiche are called goddes, whether they bee in heauen, whome they call heauenlye, or els in earth, whome they call goddes earthlye, of whiche ſorte there be manye goddes and many lordes, yet are theſe, by name onely, gods and lordes, and are to them onely ſuche, as erroniouſly beleue them ſo to be, and haue taken them for theyr goddes and lordes. But to vs chriſtians there is but onely one god, that is to ſaye, the father of Ieſus, the creatoure and gouernour of the worlde, of whome we receyue all goodnes, to whome onely beyng addicte, we ought to ſerue with al honour and reuerence.

On the other ſyde, as the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manne is ſubiecte vnto her huſbande, ſo is ſhe apparayled to his honoure, agaynſte whom, well maye ſhe be coumpted reprochefull, yf ſhe by vncoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng her heade in open places, ſhewe her owne vnſhamefaſteneſſe, and as though ſhe were free, refuſe obedience to her huſbande.

Becauſe what tyme god fyrſte made man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynde, the manne came not of the womanne, but contrarye the womanne of the manne. Firſt was Adam made of earthe and by the ſpirite of god a ſoule was geuen him, and then ſhortely after was Eue taken furth of hys ſyde, as ſhe were a certayne porcion of the manne, and euen contrary to the commen courſe of nature, firſt was made that, whiche was more perfite, and than af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward was made the imperfiter. For that, that reaſon is in manne, the ſame in matrimonie is the huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: and that, which is affeccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the man, the ſame in matrimonie is the woman. Beſide this, the man was not made for the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſake, but the woman was made and geuen to the manne for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte,<note place="margin">Neither was the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> created for the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſake.</note> and for a helpe to bring furth iſſue by generacion: in whiche act, as the man is principall doer and faſhioner, ſo is the womanne but the matier and ſufferer. Nowe good reaſon is it, that to hym the preeminence ſhoulde be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, whiche was both firſt made, and onely made of God, and not to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manne. And for aſmuche as at the firſte begynnyng of nature the huſbande hath geuen vnto hym the tytle of preeminence, ſurelye the womanne oughte to acknowledge her condicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and not onely with a readynes to pleaſe, ſhewe her ſubieccion towarde hym, but alſo in reuerente behaueour to hym. But as the ſhauen head declareth a libertie, ſo is the coueryng of the head a token of ſubieccion. But and yf any womanne bee ſo farre paſte ſhame, that ſhe regarde not the ſyght of menne, yet for Aungels ſakes and theyr teſtimonie beyng alſo preſente at your ſolemne meetynges, lette her heade be couered, and in ſo doyng, ſhe acknowledgeth what doeth beſeme her. And yet ſpeake I not this either to encourage the huſbande to vſe his wife as a vile dreuell, becauſe ſhe is commaunded to obeye, or to diſcoumforte the wyfe, becauſe ſhe is ſubiecte to her huſbande, ſynce bothe are in chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religion equall, beſydes that oftetymes the huſbande alſo needeth aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well his wyues healpe, as the wyfe her huſbandes.</p>
                     <p>And albeit at the begynnyng womanne was made of manne, yet nowe neyther the wyfe bryngeth foorth chylde without the manne, nor the manne canne become a father withoute a womanne. And yet there is no cauſe, why anye perſon ſhoulde for this with hymſelfe be eyther to muche pleaſed or grieued, ſynce it is the ordinaunce of god, whiche after ſuche ſorte ſetteth all thinges in an ordre.</p>

Then were ye lead with errour, but now are ye go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by the ſpirite of Chriſt. Now your former er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is not imputed vnto you, ſo that this remaineth, that as at that tyme your cuſtome and vſage of lyfe was euen as badde as your deuylyſh religion, ſo muſte now the ſame bee vpryght and godly, as your newe religion is trewe and holy, ſo that it appeare, that whatſoeuer is doen among you, theſame ſeme to be doen by the motion of the holy goſte. Whatſoeuer is ſayed or ſoung to the glorye of Chriſte, that ſame cometh of his ſpirite. Wherfore I declare vnto you, that no manne inſpired with the ſpirite of god the father, defieth Ieſus hys ſonne. Nor can any manne with a true heart ſaye, that Ieſus is the Lorde, but by the inſpiracion of the holy ghoſte. For all the goodnes therfore, that is in you, his fre beneuole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ought ye to thanke, and to his glory it ſhoulde bee beſtowed, And though all men haue one ſpirit in dede, yet are his giftes diuers, whiche he, as his pleaſure is, diuerſly gyueth to diuers menne. The vſe alſo and adminiſtracion of ſuche gyftes are in ſondrye wyſe beſtowed, wheras the Lorde, whoſe gyftes they are, is but one.
<pb facs="tcp:7459:97"/>
Yea and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> effect and operacion of the ſpirite in diuerſe men diuerſly worketh and gyueth lyfe, whereas yet there is of al men but one god, of whome the power and actiuitie of al thinges, howſoeuer they be wrought in men, haue theyr begynnynges. Al gyftes therfore are to be aſcribed to god onely, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be high or lowe, and there is no cauſe why any man of them, ſhould be proude. Another mannes gyfte is it, that he hathe, and whatſoeuer a man hath by the inſpiracion of the holy gooſte, that ſame is for the comon profite gyuen hym, to edifie with all, and not to be proude of it hymſelfe only. For to ſome one is giuen through the ſpirite of god, wiſdome, to gyue there with ſage and truſtie counſell. Agayne another hath by the goodnes of the ſame ſpirite gyuen vnto hym, by vtteraunce of knowledge, and rules of good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to helpe the comon weale. Another hath by the ſame ſpirite gyuen vnto hym a ſtronge confidence, whiche according to the Lordes promyſe moueth, yea mountaines out of theyr places. Another hath by the ſame, the gyfte to cure diſeaſes. Some there bee alſo, that haue a ſingular power to worke miracles. Some hath the gyfte of prophecie, therwith either to open thinges to come, or els other hydden myſteries. Another hathe gyuen vnto hym through wyttie iudgement to put difference betwixte the ſpirites in menne, whether they bee of god or not. Some haue the gyfte to ſpeake diuerſe lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, whiche is a meane, that greatly ſerueth towarde the knowledge of holy ſcriptures. Another hath geuen vnto hym, either by inſpiracion, or by knowledge of ſecret learnyng to expounde and declare that, which the other ſpoke. For it is not to be ſuppoſed, that whoſoeuer knoweth a language, alwaye vnderſtandeth the ſecrete meanynge therof.

                     <q>For as the body is one, and hath many membres, and all the membres of one bodye  though they be many, yet are but one body, euen ſo is Chriſt. For by one ſpirite are we all baptyſed, to make one bodye whether we be Iewes or Gentyles, whether we be bond or fre, and haue all droncke of one ſpirite. For the body: is not one member, but many. If the fote ſaye: I am not the hande, I am not of the body: is he therfore not of the body? And yf the care ſaye: I am not the eye. I am not of the body: is he therfore not of the body? If at the body wer an eye, where wer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the eare? If al were hearing, where wer the ſmelling? But now hath God ſet the membres euery one ſeuerally in the bodye as it hathe pleaſed hym. If they were al one member, where were the body? Now are there many membres, yet but one body: And the eye cannot ſaye vnto the hand: I haue no nede of the. Agayne, the heade cannot ſaye to the fete: I haue no nede of you.</q>
                     <p>For as, albeit euery mannes bodye bee one whole thinge, yet is it made of diuerſe members framed together, but ſo yet, that one ſpirite geueth lyfe to all the members, of whome notwithſtandinge euery one by hymſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſydered are many and diuers, yet is there of all made but one bodye: euen ſo woulde Chriſte haue it to bee in hys bodye the churche, wherof we bee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all we hauyng equallye receyued baptiſme are through the ſelfe ſame

one ſpirite framed into one bodye, whether we be Iewes or Grecians, bonde or fre, men or women, maried or ſingle, hygh or lowe. And theſame ſpirite haue we all receyued, not withſtanding it haue in diuerſe of vs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuerſe operacions. Nor is our body made of one parte onely, but of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye and diuerſe: Nowe and yf the foote abaſyng it ſelfe ſaye, I am not the hande, I haue with the reſte of the body nothyng to doe, is it ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no parte of the body? Or yf the eare bewayling her condicion ſaye: I am not the iye, I haue with the reſte of the body nothing to doe, is it ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not of the body? The diuers placyng and vſe is not to the member re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochful, but this varietie rather apertayneth to the welth of the whole body. And what office ſoeuer is geuen to any part, theſame is geuen vnto it to helpe the whole body. The iye is a goodly parte of the body, but yf the whole body were an iye, where were the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the eares? Again if the whole body were aneare, where were the noſe?

Nor yet can the head, albeit it be the palace of our ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, ſaye vnto the fete, as loweſt partes: I care not for your ſeruice.</p>

                     <q>For greater is he that prophecyeth, then he that ſpeaketh with tongues, excepte he  expounde it: that the congregacion maye haue edifying. Nowe brethren, yf I come vnto you ſpeakyng with tongues: what ſhall I profite you, excepte I ſpeake to you other by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelacion or by knowledge, or by prophecying, or by doctrine? Moreouer, when thynges without lyfe geue founde (whether it be a pype or an harpe) excepte they make a diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion in the ſoundes, howe ſhall it be knowen what is pyped or harped? For yf the trompe geue an vncertayne voyce, who ſhall prepare hymſelfe to the warre? Euen ſo lykewyſe when ye ſpeake with tongues, excepte ye ſpeake wordes that haue ſygnificacion, how ſhal it bee vnderſtande what is ſpoken? For ye ſhall but ſpeake in the ayer. Many kyndes of voyces are in the worlde, and none of them are without ſignificacion. If I knowe not what the voyce meaneth, I ſhalbe vnto hym that ſpeaketh, an alient: and he that ſpeaketh, ſhalbe an alient vnto me. Euen ſo ye (for aſmuche as ye couete ſpiritual giftes) ſeke that ye maye excell, vnto the edifying of the congregacion. Wherfore, let hym that ſpeaketh with tonges praye, that he maye interprete alſo. For yf I praye with tongue, my ſpyrite pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: but my vnderſtandyng doeth no good. What is it then? I will praie with the ſpirite, and wyll praye with the vnderſtandyng. I wyll ſyng with the ſpirite, and wyll ſyng with the vnderſtandyng. For els, when thou bleſſeſt with the ſpirite, howe ſhall he that occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyeth the roume of the vnlearned, ſaye Amen, at thy geuyng of thankes, ſeyng he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth not what thou ſayeſt? Thou verely geueſt thankes wel, but the other is not edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed. I thanke my god that I ſpeake with tongues more then ye all, yet had I leuer in the congregacion to ſpeake fyue wordes with my vnderſtandyng to the informacion of other, rather then ten thouſande wordes with the tongue.</q>
                     <p>More excellent is he that prophecieth, than is he, which with a language vttereth holye wordes, but ſuche as no man vnderſtandeth, excepte perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture he that fyrſte ſpake with tongues, ſtraight expounde, what he ſayd, that the people maye yet thereby take ſome profite, and be edified. For in dede ſome there be, whiche not ſomuche as throughly vnderſtande themſelf, what they ſounded with theyr tongue. Of wordes vnderſtanden ſome fruite maye be taken, yfye otherwyſe thynke, conceyue and imagyne, that I nowe fyrſte came to you, and coulde do nothyng, but ſpeake with langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: what good ſhall I do you, onles I ſo ſpeake, that after I declare vnto you the miſterye that I ſpake, by the gyfte of reuelacion, or els by the gyfte of knowledge eloquently intreat of ſuch thinges, as apertayne to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of faythe, or by the gyfte of prophecie open vnto you hydden miſteries, or by the gyfte of learnyng, teach you ſome ſuch poyntes, as belong to good maners. Moreouer, euen thynges, that haue no lyfe, as a pype or a harpe, whiche are made and prepared for nothing els, but to make a ſounde, yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept theſame make a certayne diſtinction in theyr ſoundes, and by conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent meaſures and harmony expreſſe either the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or dittie of the ſong, or els the purpoſe, wherunto the ſonge moueth: that is to ſaye, yf theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentes doe nothyng, but gyue a ſounde, what profite or pleaſure ſhall the hearer take, ſynce he can not diſcerne, what is played with the pype or harpe, whether it be merye or ſadde? Or yf the trumpet make an vncertayne voyce, not puttyng difference in the veray ſounde, whether it woulde haue men to begynne battayle, or to retreyte backe, what auaileth it with a trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet to make ſuche a noyſe, ſynce the ſouldiar knoweth not, whereunto he is called? And euen lykewyſe, vnles ye ſpeakyng with tongues vtter ſuche woordes, as repreſente ſome certayne and knowen mattier to the hearers, ye ſhall ſpeake in vayne, ſynce that, whiche is ſayed of you, cannot be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by meane wherof the ſpeakers wordes ſhall not enter into the hertes

of the hearers, but ſhall with theyr vayne noyſe onely fyll the ayer. Manye and diuerſe kyndes of tongues are there in the worlde, of whiche euerye one hathe his ſignificacion and voyce. The voyce maye of al men be hearde, but yf there be to the voyce nothing els adioined, in vayne ſhal one of vs ſpeake to another. For albeit eche of vs pronounce our languages well, yet becauſe neither vnderſtandeth other, it chaunceth, that bothe I, whiche ſpeake Greke, ſeme an aliante to hym that is of Afrike, and he agayne an aliante to me, being ignoraunt of the Afrike language. Wherfore ſynce ye people of Counthe of youre owne accorde folowe, and muche eſteeme the gifte of the tongues, by mine aduiſe ye ſhall applye your ſelues to the obtayning of hygher matiers that ye to the whole congregacion maye become profitable.<note place="margin">Let hym that ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth with to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue, pray that he may interprete alſo.</note> Whoſo therfore hathe the gifte of languages, let ſuche one with prayer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre of god, that he maye alſo receyue the gyfte of interpretacion. Elſwyſe, yf I praye with a tongue vnknowen to the people, for an exaumple, among the Grecians with the language of the Perſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, or yf I ſpeake a language, aſwell vnknowen vnto my ſelfe, as to other, (as ſome are wont to do, which delyghte to ſing a ſong in a ſtraunge tongue, learned by them withoute booke, whiche they vnderſtande not themſelues) in ſuche caſe in dede my ſpirite and breathe vttereth wordes of praier, but my ſoule is without fruit, ſynce I lytle or nothyng profite my ſelfe thereby, and am alſo paynefull to other, and not onely vnprofitable, but alſo to be laughed at. What muſte I do then? I wyll, when tyme and place require, praye with my voyce, but not therewith onely contented, I will praye with hearte and mynde, and with the inſtrumentes of my voyce ſyng oute the prayſes of God, but not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented neyther, I wyll ſyng with myne hearte and vnderſtandyng, adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning therto the knowledge of the tongue. For if thou expreſſe and ſyng furth the prayſes of God with a language, whiche no manne knoweth, howe ſhall the vnlearned, whiche aunſwereth in ſteade of the people, make aunſwere with the vſed woorde, Amen, when thou haſte ended thy prayer of thankes? For by puttyng therto this woorde at the ende, that is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, whiche was ſpoken before in prayers or Hymnes. For as ye knowe, this pageante, (as a manne maye call it) hathe diuers partes, ſo that the learned begynne, the vnlearned and confuſe multitude approuyng that, whiche was ſayed, with one voyce aunſwere Amen. And howe ſhall any manne make ſuche aunſwere, yf he knowe not, what thou ſayeſt. For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandyng that thou ſayeſt, bee a holy thyng, and for thy ſelfe parad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture good, yet in the meane ſeaſon the people become nothing better, whiche is for that purpoſe reſorted together, that by the hearyng of ſuche as are learned, they maye be the better, learnyng in the open place, how they ſhoulde lyue at home. But leſte anye thinke me, as one ignoraunte of the tongues, not to fauour that gifte, as the common ſorte of men vſeth muche to auaunce and prayſe ſuche poyntes, wherein themſelues are ſkylfull, and to deſpiſe and diſprayſe ſuche thinges, as they knowe not, I geue thankes to God, that in the gifte of tongues I go beyonde all you, whiche for this knowledge moſte ſtande in your owne conceites. For no kynde of language is there vſed among you, whiche I cannot bothe ſpeake and vnderſtande.

In the lawe it is wrytten: with ſoundry tongues and with  ſoundry lyppes will I ſpeake vnto thys people, and yet for all that, wyl they not heare me, ſayth the Lorde. Wherfore tonges are for a ſygne, not to them that beleue, but to them that beleue not. Contrarywyſe, prophecying ſerueth not for them that beleue not: but for them which be leue. If therfore when all the congregacion is come together and al ſpeake with tonges, there come in they that are vnlearned, or they which beleue not: wyll they not ſay, that ye are out of your wyttes? But and yf all prophecye, and there come in one that bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not, or one vnlearned, he is rebuked of al men, and is iudged of euery man, and ſo are the ſecretes of his bert opened, and ſo falleth he downe on his fare, and worſhyppeth God, and ſayeth, that God is in you of a trueth.</q>
                     <p>Therfore brethren, ſynce (as I before ſayed) godly lyfe hath, as it were, certayne ages and increaſes, endeuour your ſelues to growe vp from lower to higher giftes, that ye ſeme not alwayes chyldren.

Touching ſimple and hurtles manners, brethren I would ye conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued chyldren ſtyll, but in ſpirituall gyftes, I woulde ye wente alwayes forwarde, vntyll ye come to the higheſt. Nor thinke it nowe ſufficiente for you to hurte no man, but labour muſte ye beyng nowe ful rype, to be able to do good and to helpe all menne.

For ye may al prophecie one by one, that al may learne, and that all maye haue comforte. And the ſpyrites of the Prophetes are in the power of the Prophetes.

And if ye this doe, none impediment is there, but all may prophecie, ſo that it be doen, by courſe, and eche one in ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king geue place to other, that euery man may haue more fruite of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, whyles euery Prophete ſheweth, wherewith God hath inſpired hym, that all may enioy and receyue more plentifull comforte, whyles e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one vpon the common weale beſtoweth that, which by the ſpirite of Chriſte is geuen vnto him. Nor lay for your excuſe, that ſuche as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with the holy goſt are not theyr owne men, no more then we ſee ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhed men to be.

For wemen are not authorized, to preache abrode, as chiefe doers of matters, but commaunded to be obedient vnto theyr huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes.

For throughe only A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dames offence all we that deſcended of hym, are ſubiecte to deathe: and throughe Chryſtes only innocencie, all ſuche ſhalbe reſtored to lyfe immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, as haue deſearued to bee ioyned into hys bodye. All ſhall ryſe agayne, but yet euery manne in his order: the fyrſte of all is Chriſte, then ſuche as cleaue vnto Chryſte, as the partes of the bodye cleaue vnto the heade, of whome, a certayne, goynge out of theyr graues, roſe with Chriſte, and the reſte ſhall all ryſe at hys laſte commyng. And when the reſurreccion of the whole body is done and paſte, then ſhall nothynge remayne, but an ende of thys worldly alteracions, whiche ſhal not bee before the vtter abolyſhment of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> tyrannye of death, what tyme Chriſte as a victoriouſe conquerour ſhall delyuer vp a quiet and a peaſyble kyngdome to god his father, to whome by ſubduyug his enemies he reſtoreth his dominion: and after that he hathe dryuen awaye vtterly from hys whole bodye, and brought to nought, all the power, rule, and authoritie of his aduerſaries.</p>

                     <q>For he muſte raigne tyll he haue put all this enemyes vnder hys feete. The laſt enemy that ſhalbe deſtroyed, is death. For he hath put all thynges vnder hys feete. But when he  ſayth all thynges are put vnder hym, it is manyfeſte that he is excepted, whiche dyd put all thynges vnder hym. When all thynges are ſubdued vnto hym, then ſhall the ſonne alſo hymſelfe be ſubiecte vnto hym, that put all thynges vnder him: that God maye be all in al. Elles what do they, which are baptiſed ouer the dead, yf the dead ryſe not at all? Why are they then baptiſed ouer them, yea, and why ſtande we allwaye then in ieoperdye? By oure reioyſyng whiche I haue in Chriſte Ieſu oure Lorde, I dye dayly. That I haue fought with beaſtes at Epheſus after the maner of men, what auauntageth it me, yf the dead ryſe not agayne? Let vs eate and drynke, for to morowe we ſhall dye. Be not ye deceaued: euell woordes corrupte good manners. Awake truely out of ſlepe, and ſynne not. For ſome haue not the knowledge of God. I ſpeake this to your ſhame.</q>
                     <p>For ſo long neceſſary is it, that the ſonne ſhoulde labor and trauayle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the recouery of the kyngdome to god his father, vntyl that he haue vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ſubdued all hys enemies, and ſo treade them downe vnderneyth hys feete, that there bee no rebellion at all, nor feare of euyll.

kyngdom the father being excluded: for the kingdom of the father and the ſonne, is all one kyngdom. This new and peculiar kyngdom, wherin there ſhalbe no rebellion of ſynfull deſyres againſt the will &amp; pleaſure of God, the father recouereth vnto himſelfe by his ſonne, which he in ſuch ſorte v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth with his ſonne in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, that nethleſſe in the father the authoritie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth, as in him, of whom the ſonne receiued the ſame kingdom, which is in ſuche ſorte fully and wholy the ſonnes, that yet the father loſeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng, ſynce of both there is but one will. And then when all thinges ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be ſubiecte to the ſonne, then ſhall the ſonne ſelfe, wholy, that is to ſaye, with his bodye miſticall, yelde and ſubmitte hymſelfe to the father, by whom as chiefe doer, al thinges became ſubiecte to the ſonne, that thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furth no not in the members ſhall there any thing be lefte, whiche ſhall to Chriſte be contrarie: but that the whole ſonne ſhall conſente with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of whom as of the firſt begynner, al thinges ſhall depende, to whom as chiefe doer, all men ſhall geue thankes for all that euer in any tyme and place hath been well done. Nowe wheras I long ſynce taught you this, and ye lykewyſe learned the ſame, what meaneth this, that ſome no we doubt a freſhe, whether the dead ſhall liue againe? Wherof if there be no hope, vayne is their labour, which albeit more ſuperſticiouſly, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> godly, in ſteade of the dead receyue baptiſme, fearyng leſte ſuche one, as dyed without chriſtenyng, ſhall not ryſe among ryghteouſe people. And to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde thys, they prepare one, which in ſteade of the dead maye aunſwere, that he beleueth, and deſyreth baptiſme. Theſe mennes fayth I allowe, but their doynges I allowe not. For as it is folyſhnes to thynke that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother mans baptiſme helpeth the dead, ſo beleue they truely and well, there ſhall a reſurreccion be. For yf they thought, that the dead ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould nomore ryſe againe, neuer would they for his ſake be ſo careful. Yea &amp; we<note place="margin">By out reioyſing whiche I haue in Chriſte Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu out lorde I dye dayly</note> our ſelfes do foliſhly, which for Chriſtes doctrin dayly put our life in ieo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardie, if after ſuch greuous torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes no reward folow.

And as in this my ſaying I lye not, ſo may I alwaies glory in this reioyſing, which I haue through Ieſus Chriſt our lorde, to whoſe glory turne al the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, which we ſuffer.

                     <q>But ſome man wyll ſaye: howe aryſe the dead? with what body ſhall they come? Thou  foole, that whiche thou ſoweſt is not quyckened, excepte it dye. And what ſoweſt thou? Thou ſoweſt not that body that ſhalbe: but bare corne (as of whete, or of ſome other) but God geueth it a body at his pleaſure, to euery ſede his owne body. All fleſhe is not one maner of fleſhe: but there is one maner of fleſhe of beaſtes, another of fiſhes, and another of byrdes. There is alſo celeſtiall bodyes, and there are bodyes terreſtriall. But the glory of the celeſtiall is one, &amp; the glory of the terreſtriall is another. There is one maner glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Sunne, and another glory of the Moone, and another glory of the ſtarres. For one ſtarre differeth from an other in glory. So is the reſurreccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the dead. It is ſowen in corrupcion, it ryſeth againe in incorrupcion. It is ſowen in diſhonour, it ryſeth againe in honour. It is ſowen in weakenes, it ryſeth again in power. It is ſowen a naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it ryſeth again a ſpiritual body. There is a naturall body, and there is a ſpirituall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as it is alſo wrytten: the fyrſt man Adam was made a lyuing ſoule, and the laſt Adam was made a quickenyng ſpyrite. Howbeit, that is not fyrſte whiche is ſpirituall: but that whiche is naturall, and then that whiche is ſpirituall. The fyrſte manne is of the earth, erthy: the ſeconde manne is the Lorde from heauen (heauenly.) As is the erthy, ſuche are they that are erthy. And as is the heauenly, ſuche are they that are heauenly. And as we haue borne the image of the erthy, ſo ſhal we beare the image of the heauenly. This ſay I brethren, that fleſhe &amp; bloud cannot inherite the kyngdome of God. Neither doeth corrupcion inherite vncorrupcion. Beholde, I ſhew you a miſterie. We ſhall not all ſlepe: but we ſhall all be chaunged, and that in a momente, in the twinkling of an lye by the laſt trompe. For the trompe ſhall blowe, and the dead ſhall ryſe incorruptible, and we ſhalbe chaunged. For this corruptible muſte put on incorrupcion, and this mortall muſte put on immortalytie. When this corruptible hath put on incorrupcion, and this mortall hath put on immortalytie: then ſhalbe brought to paſſe the ſaying that is wrytten: Death is ſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp in victory: Death where is thy ſtyng? Hell where is thy victory? The ſtyng of death is ſynne, and the ſtrength of ſynne is the lawe. But thankes be vnto God whiche hath geuen vs victory, thorowe our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte. Therfore my deare brethren, be ye ſtedfaſt and vnmouable, alwayes ryche in the worke of the Lorde, for as muche as ye knowe, howe that your labour is not in vayne in the Lorde.</q>
                     <p>But now ſynce it is certaine, that a general reſurreccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhalbe, ſome curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil aſke: after what ſort ſhal it be, &amp; in what kind of bodies ſhal men riſe? ſynce the bodies, whiche we now haue, are tourned into aſhes, &amp; earth, or into ſome other thing more vile. Thou foole, which maruaileſt, howe God can once doe in renyuing bodies again, that nature dayly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in a ſede caſt into the grounde. Thou ſoweſt a drye dead ſede into the earth, &amp; there agayne theſame beyng putrified ſemeth to dye, &amp; ſo finally growyng out of the earth, as it were, lyueth agayne and groweth, nor coulde theſame in any wyſe lyue agayne, onleſſe it be fyrſte dead and buried. But nowe groweth the ſede vppe in another fourme, that it had,
<pb n="xlii" facs="tcp:7459:105"/>
when it was caſt into the earth. Into the earth is caſt a lytle, vyle, blacke and drye grayne, which beeng by continaunce of tyme putrified there, in due ſeaſon groweth vp, and becommeth fyrſt a tender graſſe, and then a ſtalke, and ſo at the laſte an eare. Of all whiche three there appeared none in that ſmall grayne, which thou before dydeſt caſt into the earth. Euery ſede hath his power, which, when it is growen vp, appeareth, ſo that it may now ſeme vtterly to be an other, where thou in dede knoweſt it to be the ſame, ſaue that it is chaunged into a better forme. Seeſt thou not, of a lyttle kernell, howe greate a tree groweth? howe myghtye a ſtemme there is, howe the rootes ſpreade, howe large boughes, what a noumbre of braunches, howe pleaſaunte bloſomes, and plentefulnes of fruyte there is? Of all which there was nothyng, when thou dyd caſt that ſealye ſmall kernell into the grounde. And yet at that tyme all theſe thinges dideſt thou hope for, vpon truſt conceiued of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> workes of nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and dareſt thou not vpon truſt of Gods almyghtye power ſurely looke for the lyke to be done by God? A kernell it was, that thou ſowedſte, and not a tree, and yet geueth God to that kernell once quickned, a body, ſuche as his pleaſure is, which geueth euery kynde of ſede a ſpeciall property, that wheras all growe agayne, yet haue they not in all poyntes theſame forme they had before. And after lyke ſorte is it in all kyndes of beaſtes, wherof euery one hath his ſeueral ſede, ſo that of euery ſeed euery beaſte can not be engendred. And though this to all beaſtes be commen to haue<note place="margin">All fleſhe is not one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of fleſh.</note> a fleſhy body, yet is there betwixte one fleſh and an other no ſmall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. For the fleſh of men is of one maner, and the fleſh of beaſtes, fyſhes and byrdes is of another. Lykewiſe alſo though ſuch creatures, as lacke lyfe, be called bodies, yet is there a diuerſe forme in heauenly bodies, and in earthly, as in ſtones, water and earth. Yea and as there is of heauenly bodyes one beautie and comlynes, and of earthly an other, euen ſo a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie is there among the heauenly bodyes them ſelfe. Fyrſte nether is there lyke glory and bryghtnes of the Moone, with the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, nor of other ſtarres with the Moone, and briefly euen the verie ſtarres ſelfe in bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe diffre one from another, for all are not as bryght as the day ſtarre is. Lykewyſe at the reſurrection all men ſhall ryſe with theyr owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, but yet in an vnlyke glory, without doubte as it ſhal pleaſe God to gyue them, and as they in this lyfe haue deſerued. For the vngodly ſhall riſe in one fourme &amp; the good in an other. Among them alſo that are good, euerie one, as he hath in this lyfe vſed hymſelfe, ſo ſhal he excell other in the gloriouſnes of his new bodye. Yet generally all good men ſhall haue a muche more actiue bodye, than was that, which they by death forſoke. And as it is in nature to couer the ſeed vnder the earth, the ſame is in the matier of reſurrection, the buriall of the deade bodye. And that whiche in the ſeede is growyng agayne, is in the bodye ryſyng agayne. And as in the one, that is muche better, which groweth vp, than was that, which was caſte into the earth: euen ſo here, albeit it be theſame bodye, that ryſeth agayne, yet is it farre vnlike. There is ſowen as it were a grayne into the earth, a body ſubiect to corruption, but theſame ſhall ryſe againe without all corruption. There is hydden in the earth a vyle body &amp; loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, but there ſhall ryſe againe a body both gloriouſe and honourable.
<pb facs="tcp:7459:106"/>
There is buryed a bodye, whiche euen when it lyued was weake, but it ſhall ryſe agayne full of power and myght. There is buryed a bodye, which albeit were alyue, yet were it groſſe and heauye, and by the reaſon of that bourdaynouſe to the ſoule, gouernour of the ſame, but there ſhall ryſe agayne not a naturall, but a ſpirituall bodye, whiche ſhall to the ſoule be no let, whither ſoeuer it moue. For this is a difference of bodies alſo, one is naturall, whiche hath neede of meate and drynke, and is we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed with labour, whiche is diſeaſed, whiche with age weareth awaye, which with his groſſe and fautie inſtrumentes, ofttimes letteth the intent of the ſoule, which by reaſon of froward deſyers oftentimes prouoketh to vyce, to whome yf the ſoule be obedient and geue ouer, the ſame is as it were tourned into the body, and groweth out of his nature into fleſhe: another is ſpirituall, which being in this lyfe by lytle and lytle purged from ſenſual appetites and deſiers, and after by reſurrection renewed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, is in maner tranſfourmed into the nature of the ſoule, to whom it by godly deſyre applyed it ſelfe: that as oure ſoule obeyng the ſpirite of god is rauiſhed and in maner tranſformed into him: ſo maye our bodyes beyng<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> obedient vnto the ſoule be pourged, and ſhakyng of his groſſenes be purified into ſuch a body, as is very lyke to the ſoule. This groſſe and earthly body receiued we of our firſt father Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which as he was made of earth, ſo was he ſubiect to earthly deſiers. But there is an other ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de Adam, not ſomuche the begynner of our natiuitie, as of our reſurrection, which as he hath an heauenly beginning, ſo was he fre from al infeccion of earthly deſyers. And ſo reade we in Geneſis: The fyrſte man Adam was made to lyue through y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> benefite of the ſoule, but yet ſo, that the ſoule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng as it were bound to the groſſe body ſhould do nothing, but by bodily inſtrumentes, or at the leaſte by ſome material meane. But after him was geuen a ſeconde Adam, which as he was conceaued by the holy goſt, ſo ſhould he geue lyfe to his, not this groſſe lyfe, whiche we haue in many poyntes common with beaſtes, but a ſpirituall and a heauenly lyfe. By Chriſt therfore are we repayred in al poyntes into a better ſtate. For that thing, whiche is in time firſte, is alſo in ſubſtance more groſſe, and that by the order of nature. We nowe beare about with vs a naturall bodye, and in tyme to come we ſhall haue a ſpirituall bodye. As the groſſe parent of our ſtocke went before, ſo folowed Chriſt the begynner of a newe genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. And what ſorte of one the earthly parent was, ſuche are his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that is to ſaye, men gyuen to earthly deſyres. And agayne what kynde<note place="margin">The fyrſte manne is of the earth earthly.</note> of one the heauenly Adam was, ſuch are they, which are borne agayne in hym, that is to wete, wholy delyted with heuenly thinges. For we muſt for this ſtate begyn that here, which we intende herafter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitely to enioye. As before baptiſme in vngraciouſe maners we reſemblyd the nature of our fyrſt father, ſo being borne agayne vnto Chriſt through baptiſme, we muſte nowe in heauenly lyfe reſemble oure heauenly father. And yf we this do not, neither ſhall we be here partes of Chriſtes bodye, nor in tyme to come gloriouſly ryſe agayne. In deede admitted are we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kyngdom of god: but this I tell you brethren, that fleſh and bloud, that is to ſay, men of the firſt generacion cannot come to the enheritaunce of the kyngdome of God: nor the lyfe whiche is with ſynne corrupted,
<pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:7459:106"/>
ſhall haue the inheritaunce of lyfe immortall. And becauſe ye ſhall be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt of nothyng apertaynyng to the maner of reſurreccion, beholde I tell you a miſterie. We ſhall not all dye, for the laſte daye ſhall peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fynde ſome of vs alyue, but yet ſhall all we be chaunged to the glory of immortall lyfe, whiche here after a ſorte abſtayning from the infeccion of ſynne through godly conuerſacion, beginne the immortal lyfe to come. This chaunge ſhal not be made by lytle &amp; lytle, as we ſee natural thinges chaunged, but in a minute &amp; twynkling of an iye, at the ſounde of the laſte troumpe. For the troumpe ſhall blow, at the voyce wherof ſuche as then are dead ſhall ryſe immortall. And we, whiche ſhall at that day be found alyue, beyng ſodaynly chaunged ſhall lyue after an other ſorte, that is to ſay, as they doe, which are ryſen again. For neceſſary it is, that before we perfitly poſſeſſe the kingdom of heauen, we vtterly put of al earthlynes, and that this our corruptible body be made incorruptible, and this our mortal body become immortall. When this is ſo, than ſhal that verely be perfourmed, which the Prophete O ſee foreſeing ſayth, reioyſing at the<note place="margin">Death is ſwalowed vp in victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. &amp;c.</note> vtter deſtruccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> death is ſwalowed vp through victory. Where is now death thy ſtyng<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> o hell where is thy victory? The ſting of death is ſinne, &amp; the ſtrength of ſinne is the lawe, which by occaſion geuing prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs to ſinne. When the law is taken away, the power of ſinne is faynt and feble, when ſinne is taken awaye, the power of death ceaſeth, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the ſtyng is taken awaye, wherwith ſhe is wounte to ſtryke vs. Vnable were we vtterly to fyght againſt ſuch violent aduerſaries, were it ſo, we had no ſtrength but our owne: thankes therfore be geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to God, which hath cauſed, that if we wil, we may wynne this gloryous victory through Ieſus Chriſte our Lorde, whiche for our ſakes with his death ouercame death, and toke vpon hym to purge our ſynnes. Therfore my dearly beloued brethren, ſynce it is certaine, that the reſurreccion ſhalbe, and ſynce it is knowen what blyſſe &amp; glory men ſhall enioy therby, which yet no man ſhal receiue, but ſuch as here, by forſaking ſinne, and by godly liuing begynne it, doubte not of that ye haue once beleued, nor ſuffer your ſelfes with the talking of vngodly perſons to bemoued from your right receyued fayth, but rather apply continually to profite in ſuch thynges, as may bryng you into Gods fauoure, that ye become euery day better than other, preparyng your ſelfes agaynſt the reſurreccion to come.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that Sainct Paule hath at the beginning of this epiſtle ſomewhat ſpoken of his great troubles and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliccions whiche he had ſuffered for Chriſtes goſpelles ſake, declaryng that in al them god was his coumfort, firſte he ſheweth the cauſes why he came not agayne to the Corinthians, as he had in his other epiſtle promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And ſtraight after that, bringeth agayne in fauour with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Corinthians the haynouſe fornicatour, whom he by his former epiſtle had commaunded to bee geuen ouer to Satan, deſyring them louyngly to receiue hym vpon hys amendement, whome they had baniſhed for his offence. And this in maner is all that he doth in the firſte and ſeconde chapter. Then reherſeth he his greate laboure in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng the Goſpell, by the waye checkyng and reprouyng other falſe Apoſtles whiche ſekyng for theyr owne aduauntage and glorie in all tymes and places, allured men to Moſes lawe, whiche they in ſuch ſort laboured to myngle with the law of Chriſte, as though without it, there were no hope of ſaluacion. And therefore preferreth he the lyght of the goſpell before the ſhadowes of Moſes lawe, eftſones exhortyng them, not to the ceremonies of the lawe, but to be vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryght of conſcience, and to leade a chriſtian lyfe, ſhewyng in the meane ſeaſon, how without corrupcion he had preached Chriſtes goſpell, and what miſeries he had ſuffered for the goſpels ſake in hope of heauenly reward. And beſide this declareth, in what poyntes chriſtianitie ſpecially ſtandeth. Of all whiche mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Paule entreateth in the latter ende of the ſeconde chapter, and in the thirde, the fourth, fyfte, and in the begynnyng of the ſyxte. For in the reſte of this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and in the begynnyng of the nexte, he exhorteth them to knowe theyr owne dignitie, and the holines of theyr profeſſion, willyng them to abſteyne wyth all diligence from the corrupcion and viciouſe life of painyms, as men with whom they had nothyng to dooe. Fourthly he mollifieth the ſharpenes vſed in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer epiſtle, prayſyng theyr obedience, for that they in all poyntes obeyed his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, notwithſtandyng the ſharpe earneſtnes thereof: reioyſing, that the ſhort heauines, wherein he had caſte them by his letters, had made both, that is to we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e, the Corinthians and hym mearye, euen as men are wont to be when they by bitter medicines are reſtored to health. Fyftlye he prouoketh euerye one of them, as well by the exaumple of the Macedonians, as by dyuers argumentes and recordes of ſcriptures, to beſtow according to theyr abilities, and as their good wyll was, ſome thyng towarde the reliefe of the ſayntes, that were at Hieruſalem, remembryng that he by Peter was commaunded ſo to doe, for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſame purpoſe ſending thither Tytus with a coumpanion, whiche was (as the more parte doth ſuppoſe) Luke, whome he commendeth vnto them: and thys dothe Paule in the .viii. and in the .ix. chapter.

reproueth, which with proud &amp; highe lokes toke vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the honour and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of apoſtles, bringing Paule into diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone, as whiche vſed ſhomakers crafte, and that he was rude, and vnlearned: &amp; beſyde this ofttymes wronged, and beaten. Againſte them Paule defendeth his authoritie, declaryng that at alttymes he had an apoſtles power and autority, which yet he woulde not vſe to other mens payne, as ſome did, but only to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of his hearers, &amp; the glory of Chriſt. Then becauſe he was compelled ſomwhat to boaſt of himſelf, he deſireth them firſt to beare with his foliſhnes, &amp; then fyrſt he maketh himſelfequal with the chief apoſtles, and by an by ſetieth hymſelf before them al, &amp; that for many cauſes, eyther becauſe he more enlarged the doctrine of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> goſpel, or els becauſe he only taught theſame freely, as which was nether by him ſelf, nor by any of his chargeable to the Achaians: or finally becauſe he had for the goſpels ſake ſuffered more perſecucion than anye of them al, coumpting ſuch miſeries and troubles as matter to glorie vpon, for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which other thought him more to be deſpiſed. After which of an humble &amp; low mind he confeſſeth his rudenes and barbarouſnes in language, but yet knowlage and learnyng taketh he vpon him, leſte they myghte in hym for this finde any lacke. Finally becauſe the falſe apoſtles among the ſimple people made greate crakes of fayned viſions of angels, Paule ſhewethe them a verye notable and a trewe viſion, as who was taken vp into the thyrd heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and was there taught ſuch thynges, as paſſed all mennes capacities: and of theſe thynges intreateth he, in the, x, xi, &amp; xii, chapter. Seuenthly, leſt through falſe apoſtles they myght fall agayne into theyr old vice, he ſaieth that he purpoſed to ſe them agayn: eftſones with threateningts warnyng them, not to be founde ſuche in theyr ordre of lyfe, as therby he myghte be compelled, by vſyng extremitie, to be vnlike hymſelfe: or els, leſte, as he was compelled vehemently by letters to wryte vnto them, ſo myght he beyng preſent, be compelled to vſe his autoritie, otherwyſe than he had done in tymes paſt, when he myght haue lawfullye done ſo. And this doth Paule in the latter ende of the .xii. chapter, and in the xiii. The greeke titles declare, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> this epiſtle was ſent from Philippos by Titus and Lucas. But the bryefe argumentes whiche are found in latine bokes, without any autours name, record and teſtifie that it was by theſame meſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſent from Troas, for of this place Paule maketh mencion in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde chapter of this preſent epiſtle.</p>

Seyng then that we knowe, how the Lorde is to be feared, we fate fayre with men. For we are knowen wel inough vnto god. I truſt alſo that we are knowen in your conſciences.

Yf it chaunce vs for this preſent tyme to fall, we may amende, but we ſhall not alwaye be able ſo to doe. For in the Prophete Eſai this ſpeaketh God: in a tyme accepted haue I heard the, and in the daye of ſaluacion haue I ſuckered the.

                     <p>Nor ſpeake I this arrogantly, but ſo alway fauour and aide me the trueth of Chriſte, as not onely at Corinthe, but alſo in the whole countrey of Achaia thys glorye of myne in preachyng of the goſpell freely, ſhall not be taken from me. And why doe I this? Deſpyſe I your liberalitie for anye hatred borne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you? God knoweth, that thys is not the cauſe, but that whiche I dooe, and mynde to dooe hereafter, is to cut away all occaſyon from ſuche, as in vs ſeeke to fynde faulte: that where as theſe menne are ryche, pretendyng openly that they refuſe rewardes, and yet receyue them ſecretlye, that not ſo muche as in this poynte, wherein they ſeeke for a falſe prayſe, they be founde better than wee, whiche not ſo muche as in our pouertie receiue oughte of anye man, not ſufferyng that they ſhoulde paſſe vs, no not in thys vayne and counterfaycte kynde of godlineſſe. For theſe in dede preache the goſpell, not of good will, but for theyr owne lucre and auauncemente, and whereas they are neither ſente by Chriſt nor dooe Chriſtes ſeruice, yet take they falſely vpon them the honor of an Apoſtles name, and make as though they were hyred into the vineyarde of the lorde, and that they are hys woorkemen, when they hynder hys buſineſſe, and vnder the pretence of the Goſpell ſeeke theyr belly fare, enterlaſyng theyr owne doctrine, muche like them, whiche intendyng to deceiue, mingle with the pureſte wine that can be had, deadly poyſone, takyng vpon them in the meane ſeaſon an apoſtles perſone, that vnder the colour of that autoritie, and ſhadow of that hygh name, they may the rather deceiue ſimple people, more lyke to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlude players, then to Apoſtles. And ſurely it is the moſte deuelyſhe kinde of deceite, vnder the colour of religion to ſowe the venemous poyſon of vngodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. They ſay that Chriſte is theyr maiſter, when in dede they dooe the deuill ſeruice. Nor maruaile is it any, if the ſcholers reſemble theyr maiſters. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the darke deuill ſatan hymſelfe with no other craftie meane more hurteth menne, than whan he by dyſſemblyng what he is, by enchauntemente turneth hymſelfe into the lykeneſſe of a bryghte aungell.

Yf that power be gone from you, it is a plaine profe, that eyther your fayth is waxen faynte, or that Chriſte beyng diſpleaſed with your euyll lyfe hathe altered his good mynde to warde you.

But howeſoeuer the matter goe with you, I truſte ye ſhall in vs euidently perceyue, that we are not forſaken. My faythe is whole, and thereby ſhall Chriſte in me bee able to punyſhe al ſuche, as wyll not with a good will come to amendmente. But what ſayd I, (I truſte?) yea rather contrarie muche more wyſhe we and deſyer God that through your faultes I be not compelled to ſhewe my power, not becauſe we feare, leſte we be founde weake, if we goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſhewe theſame, as ſome vaynly talke of me: this rather is my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyer, that we be coumpted as caſtawayes, ſo that ye be vpright and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſte.

For agaynſte the truth we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng, but whatſoeuer we can doe, all is for the truth: in ſomuche that we agaynſte innocentes haue no power, but agaynſte offenders are we of power. Yf there be in you nothing founde worthy of correccion, ye ſhall as it were vnarme vs, with innocencie declaryng your ſelfes mightie, by reaſon that ye ſhal fro me as a weake one take away the power geuen vnto me to puniſhe with all. The ſlaunderers of my name will ſaye I can doe nothing, affirmyng that I coulde not for ſome lacke in me, doe that thing, whiche by reaſon of your integritie I coulde not doe.

This thing alſo Hillary, who was himſelf a Frenchma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> borne, in his hymnes teſtifyeth, in the ſame callyng his countreymen dullardes. Sainte Paule alſo in this preſent Epiſtle reprouing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> calleth them A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noetous, that is to ſay, witleſſe or fooliſhe: to whoſe capacitie temperyng his matter, he more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently and ſharpely reproueth, then in other of his Epiſtles he doeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, rather checkyng then teachyng them, to thentent that ſuch, as could not with reaſon be brought to a better mynde, might yet at leſtwyſe with authoritie be called home againe and amended. In this Epiſtle laboreth Paule about that matter, whiche he els where in euery place doeth: to cal men (I ſay) from the bondage of Moſes lawe to the grace of the goſpell, whiche matter in his epiſtle to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Romaines he alſo entreateth of, becauſe both people were in like errour, but yet after a ſondry ſorte fallenther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto. For the Romaines were fyrſt brought to Iewiſhenes, &amp; afterward amended: but the Galathians contrarye beyng by the Apoſtle fyrſt well taught, were through the ſleightie deſceiptes of falſe apoſtles brought backe againe to Iewiſhe religion. In the Romaines, ſimplenes it was, that they were through miſteachyng begiled, but of wyſedome and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecion it came, that after warnyng they ſone amended: on the other ſide, wheras the Galathians ſone receiued and fauored Chriſtes doctrin, that was a point of eaſines: but ſtraight after to fal againe from it, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Iewes was euen lightnes and foliſhnes. To them there came falſe apoſtles takyng vpon them as though they had been ſent from the chief Apoſtles Peter and Iames, whiche labored to abate Paules authoritie, teachyng them, that to him there ſhould no credence be geuen, as whiche was inconſtant, ſometymes obſeruyng the ceremonies of the lawe, as it appeared, by that he made a vowe, ſhauyng his head, &amp; cauſed Timothe to be circumciſed: and ſometymes with the Gentiles reprouyng and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnyng the lawe, bearyng them in hand alſo, that ſuche rather ought to be beleued, as had with Peter and Iames been conuerſaunt and other, whiche had ſeen Chriſt in his manhod, whereas Paule had neither ſeen Chriſt, nor was, but a diſciple of ſuche as were diſciples, and not the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of Chriſt. Paule therfore vehemently and ſharpely, (for none epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle is there more ſharpe) with a holſome earneſtnes and fauorable ſharp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes bothe cureth the Galathians errour, and alſo defendeth his owne authoritie, openyng the falſe apoſtles diſceiptes, at the beginnyng of the epiſtle, makyng him ſelfe equal euen with the chiefe apoſtles, yea, and in
<pb facs="tcp:7459:131"/>
this point aboue them, becauſe he was at that tyme by Chriſt put in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to preache, after that he was become immortall, and vpon bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of this authoritie, for a certain tyme both in Arabia and Damaſco preached Chriſt, before that he had talked with any of the Apoſtles, after whiche enterpriſe he graunteth, that he ſawe in deede at Ieruſalem for a fewe dayes Peter &amp; Iames, of whom yet he was nothyng holpen, after whiche tyme he ſayeth he preached. xiiii. yeres in Syria and Cilicia, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyll ſuche tyme as he was by God commaunded to returne vnto Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem with Barnabas and Titus, wher Paule compared and examined his goſpel with ſuche as wer Chriſtes Apoſtles: not becauſe that he then beganne to doubt of his ſo many yeres preachyng, but to the intent that by theyr approbacion and allowaunce, whoſe authorities were chiefe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all men, other might the more be confirmed: at whiche tyme he ſo compared with Peter, that of him he learned nothyng as touchyng the goſpell, and was not onely by Peter not compelled to charge the Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les with the burden of the lawe, but what tyme Peter at Antioche eate in company of the gentiles ſuche meates as wer by the lawe forbidden, &amp; after for feare of the Iewes that came withdrewe him ſelfe from that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, he checked him euen to his face, declaryng that through fayth men obtaine the grace of God offred by the goſpel, &amp; not by kepyng of the law whiche was at that tyme aboliſhed. And though he begunne this diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion, as it were with Peter, yet perſueth he the ſame more at large turnyng his matter to the Galathians, inſtructyng them and declaryng, that Moſes lawe was geuen but for a tyme, and that al thynges taught therin appertained and directed to Chriſt onely: that in the lawe was but fleſhe, in the goſpel was the ſpirite, in the lawe there were ſhadowes, in the goſpel light, in the lawe images, in the goſpel the truth, finally in the lawe bondage, in the goſpel libertie: and that it was in the Galathians extreme foliſhnes after they had taſted of better thynges, to fal to worſe. Whiche pointes ſaint Paule entreateth of in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> fyrſt, the ſecond, the third and fourth chapiter, then after that he hath very earneſtly warned them that by receiuyng circumſicion they ſhould not ſhamefully caſt them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues into the bondage of the lawe, he teacheth, that chriſtian libertie is not a libertie to do what a manne luſt ſynnefully, but a willyng and a ioyfull mynde to do well euen for loue, and not becauſe the lawe ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth. Finally he exhorteth the Galathians to chriſtian concorde, to helpe ſuche as are weake or fallen, and to do for ſuche as haue taught vs chriſtian fayth, and that ſuche workes, becauſe they be workes of the ſpirite, are with euerlaſting glory rewarded, whereas temporal ceremonies deſerue but glory temporal, incidently bringyng the falſe Apoſtles into diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and hatred, as whiche for nothyng els labored to haue the Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans circumciſed, but becauſe they might therof glorye, as bryngers to paſſe of ſuche an high arte. Lyke diſeaſes haue ſuche now a daies, whiche fynde out newe &amp; ſtraunge kindes of religions, that it may be ſayd, ſuche a kynde of men made he.</p>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was committed vnto Peter (for he that was myghtie in Peter, in the apoſtleſhyp ouer the circumciſion, the ſame was mightie in me among the Gentiles) when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued the grace, that was giuen vnto me, then Iames, Cephas, and Iohn, whiche ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be pillers, gaue to me and Barnabas the right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of that felowſhyp, that we ſhoulde be apoſtles among the Heathen, and they in the circumciſion, onlye y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> we ſhould remember the poore.

                     <p>Now yf ſome of them, whoſe authoritie is chiefe, at any tyme either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted of any other circumciſion, or elles permitted it, whither they therin well dyd or not, that lytle appertayneth vnto me, this is for me ſufficient, that they haue forſaken theyr olde opinion, and are nowe of the ſame, that I am of. Howe ſoeuer the matier goe, it is among men a great mattier to be well eſtemed, but with god are not regarded ſuche outwarde apparen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but the very trouthe. Be it ſo y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> their authoritie is greater, than myne, yet as touchyng the pure preaching of the goſpell, they ſo lytle furthered me, that they had rather by me therin ſome encreaſe and furtheraunce.
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:7459:135"/>
For after y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vpon declaracion and tryal had of my preachyng vnto them, they perceyued, that Chriſte had aſwell put me in truſte with preaching of his goſpel among the Gentiles, as he had done Peter among the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and when they ſawe alſo that my preachyng without circumciſion was no leſſe effectual, than Peters was, with circumciſion ioyned with his, and vpon oure reporte they vnderſtode that god had gyuen vs with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> equall grace of the goſpell, ſo ferre were Peter, Iames, and Iohn who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge them were thought principall pillers, from reprouyng my prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng, that with me and Barnabas gyuyng vs theyr ryght handes, they made alegue of felowſhippe, that we ſhoulde with one conſent and mynde preache one goſpel, euery man in his portion: we among the Gentiles, and they among the Iewes. Nor gaue they vs any iniunction, to call anye of the Gentiles to circumciſion. Onely this deſyred they of vs, that what tyme we among the Gentiles preached the goſpell, we woulde remember the poore people, whiche were at Hieruſalem, that they thereby myght by ſome of them be relieued. In whiche poynte, foraſmuche as it well agreed with the doctrine of the goſpel, we diligently obeyed that theyr commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, as we would not haue done, had they gyuen vs in commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to circumciſe the Gentiles. For an vnmete thyng is it, that with vs any mannes authoritie ſhoulde ſo take place, that for fauer borne vnto hym we ſhoulde not after a ryght trade ſee vnto the ghoſpel. For as at the begynnyng the matier required ſome thyng for a ſeaſon to beare with ſuche as from Iewyſhenes were turned to the goſpel (becauſe they could not vtterly be brought from y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> religion, wherin accordyng to theyr elders lawes was, they were nozeled euen from theyr youthe) leſte by that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion many might from Chriſte be diſcouraged: ſo was there a diligence to be vſed, that through oure aduertiſement ſuche people myghte be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to leaue any lenger to be borne with, ſpecially ſynce therin there was more ieopardy, than auauntage. For of them, whiche of Iewes embrace the doctrine of the goſpell, a verye ſmall noumber is there, in compariſon of them, whom we of the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles by our preachyng, haue enryched Chriſt with.</p>
                     <p>And of theyr further encreaſe alſo ſtande we in great hope, ſynce the Gentiles dwell ſo fer and wyde abrode in the worlde, whereas the Iewes in compariſon be contayned, but within a very narow cumpace. Nowe of the Gentiles the greateſt parte in ſuche ſorte abhorre circumciſion, that more lyke were they to forſake Chriſt, &amp; his goſpell, then vpon them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the yoke of ſuche an odiouſe law. Beſide al this alſo, this greater ieo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardy is to be feared, leſte yf men longe &amp; in moſt places abrode vſe ſuche kynde of ſufferaunce and bearyng, it come to paſſe, that the free benefite of our ſaluacion, for the whiche goddes goodnes and oure fayth ſhoulde be tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ked, greatly ſeme to hang vpon the ceremonies of the law. Which yf men ſe obſerued by the chiefe apoſtles, then wyll ſuche, as are ſomwhat bent to ſuperſticion, take it, as thoughe without them the fayth taught by the goſpell to the attaynyng of euerlaſtyng ſaluacion were not ſufficient. For what is externally done, all men ſe, but with what myndes and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thynges are done, that ſe they not.
<pb facs="tcp:7459:136"/>
And in matiers of ſuſpicion it is a knowen thyng, that men are commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But to exacte that of the Gentiles, whiche was but for a tyme ſuffered in the Iewes, that maye by no meanes be borne with. The Iewes fyrſte were excuſed by reaſon of a certayne perſwaſion receyued of theyr predeceſſours, and beſyde that by a long cuſtome, whoſe power is aſmuche effectuall, as is the power of nature: agayne by that god was y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> authour of theyr lawe, by dyuerſe other thynges alſo, of which none maye be brought for defence of the Gentiles, yf they ſhoulde lykewyſe myngle Moſes lawe and Chriſtes together.

                     <p>Beware, leſte with ſuche ſtandyng in your owne conceytes ye deceyue your ſelues, ſaying we wyl not to the whole burden of the lawe be bound, ſomewhat wyl we take of the lawe, as for example circumciſion onlye, leſt we ſeme vtterly to refuſe it, as for ſacrificyng of beaſtes, with ſuche other obſeruaunces of the lawe, them wyll we not medle with. But becauſe ye ſhall not be deceyued, I tell all men playnlye whoſoeuer doth circumciſe hym ſelfe, whether he be Iewe or Gentile, the ſame man maketh hymſelfe bonde to the kepyng of the whole lawe. For as throughe baptiſme menne wholy belong to Chriſte: ſo, whoſo is circumciſed, byndeth hymſelfe to all the law, for circumciſion is the marke, wherby he becommeth a Iew. The vncircumciſed Gentiles ſtande in libertie to gather here and there out of the lawe, ſuche thinges as are nedefull, but the circumciſed are bounde to the whole lawe. Whoſo is content to receyue circumciſion, muſte lykewiſe therwith receyue ſacrifices, kepyng of the Sabboth, feaſtes of the newe Moone, waſhynges, choyſe of meates, ſtanding faſting dayes, with ſuche other lyke.

And ſo the laſte errour ſhalbe worſe than the farther. For (as Salomon ſayeth) whan preachynge ceaſeth, the people ſhall runne hauocke. And it is that ſubtill Satans practiſe alſo, in pretence of the ghoſpelles libertie, to cauſe men to make their belies their Goddes: as we ſee dayly (alas therfore) euery lyghte headded ydle perſon, and euerye raungeyng ruffion ſhameleſly pampre his paunche with fleſhe and delicates, regardynge neyther ordre nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune wealth, ſparyng nether place nor time, ne yet geuing god any tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes at al ether for fleſhe or fiſhe, meate or drinke, as it may appeare by their impudent abominable lyuinge, &amp; couetous gredynes of worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: in ſwearyng, whoring, dyceing, cardyng, braullyng, raylyng, braggyng, querelling, fighting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> piking, ſtealing, robbing, bawdy talkyng, &amp; in al kyndes elles of helliſhe iniquitie.

                  <hi>The argument vpon the Epiſtle</hi> of the Apoſtle Saynt Paule vnto the Epheſians by. D. Eraſmus of Roterodame.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Pheſus was ſometyme the chiefe citie of the leſſe Aſia, a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſuperſticiouſly geuen to the wurſhipping of deuilles, and eſpecially of Diana, for whiche cauſe it is called in the actes of the Apoſtles, the wurſhipper of Diana, not of Diana the huntour, vnto whome the Poetes attribute bowe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, but Diana with many pappes, whome the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans call Polymaſton, and ſaye, ſhe is the nource of all maner of beaſtes, after Hieromes reporting. For the temple of Diana at Epheſus, was in the greateſt eſtimacion of al the world, ſo much that the Ethnike wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours make ſpecial mencion of it, almoſt in al their writinges. Theſe men geue their whole ſtudies vnto curiouſe artes and ſciences: as we may gather where we reade, that at the preaching of the Apoſtles, they brought in theyr bookes of enchauntmente, and burned them in the fyer, and whan they had coumpted the price, they founde it to be fiftie thouſand ſiluerlinges, as it is purported in the .xix. Cap. of the Actes. And therfore to thentent he might withdrawe them from thoſe great errours, he taried ſtill among them three yeares, trauaylling all that while, to the vttermoſt of hys power, to bring the thyng to paſſe, that myght be to the profitabe forwarding of theyr ſaluacion, albeit many of them made great reſiſtence agaynſte him, as he ſpecifyeth hymſelfe in an other place. And there he was caſt to beaſtes: lyke as he maketh mencion, in his ſecounde Epiſtle to the Corinthians. And whan he departed from thence, he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Timothee to remaine there ſtill amonge them. And like as that Citie was full of Curiouſe menne, and ſuche as were geuen to magicall artes, euen ſo had it many great learned men in it. By reaſon wherof, Paule, as he tempereth himſelfe according to the maners and natures of all men, maketh often menci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of deuils and ſpirites, whan he ſheweth the difference of good men and bad. Beſides theſe, he openeth certaine darke hard ſentences. For there is none of his Epiſtles, that hath ſo darke and hidde ſentences in it, as this to the Epheſians. So as it ſhoulde ſeme, that this Epiſtle was the chiefeſt occaſion, why Petre wrote after this ſorte. Euen as our derely beloued brother Paule, accordyng to the wiſedome geuen vnto hym, wrote to you, yea, almoſte in euery Epiſtle, ſpeaking of ſuche thynges: among whiche, many thynges are harde to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanden, which they that are vnlearned, and vnſtable, peruert, as they do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſcriptures to theyr owne deſtruccion. Therfore becauſe theſe men aboade conſtauntly in the fayth, he exhorteth them to continue and goe ſtill forwarde, vntill they were become perfite: putting them in remembraunce, what manier of people they were, whan they were addict vnto naughtines, &amp; did ſeruice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wieked ſpirites: and what they are become now, that they are engraffed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſte: and teacheth them withall, that althoughe the grace of the Goſpell was promiſed vnto the Iewes, yet that by the eternall decree of God, it was rightfully enlarged vnto the Gentiles alſo: and that he was a minyſter orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God, to that ſame office. And foraſmuche as he wrote thys Epiſtle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in priſon, he exhorteth them, not to caſt downe theyr hartes for his afflicci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but rather thinke, that they haue ſo much the more cauſe to reioyce. Theſe
<pb facs="tcp:7459:159"/>
thinges he treateth of in the firſt and ſeconde Chapters. In the other three, he preſcribeth the fourme of godly conuerſacion vnto them, ſhewing what is to be folowed, and what is to bee auoyded: the duetyes of the huſbandes to the wyues, and of the wyues vnto the huſbandes: the offices of parentes to their children, and of the children to theyr parentes: the dueties of maiſters to their ſeruauntes, and of ſeruauntes to their maiſters. This Epiſtle was written from the citie of Rome by Tichicus the Diacone, whome he ſpeaketh of in the end of the Epiſtle, calling him a faithful miniſter. Ambroſe ſayeth furthermore, that he wrote it in prieſon, whan he was caried from Hieruſalem to Rome, and liued vnder ſuertie without the tentes, in the tenement that he had taken for hyre.</p>

But God<note place="margin">Bleſſed bee God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> the father of our lorde Ieſus Chriſt, is altogether to be praiſed on our behalfe, that of hys free fauour, hath powred all gentle kyndeneſſe vpon vs, not beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng thoſe thinges vnto vs, that perteyne to the vſe of this lyfe, and bodelye ſuſteynaunce onelye, but alſo thoſe excellent giftes, that auayle to the ſaluacion of ſoule, and lyfe immortall: which lyfe abydeth vs in heauen, through Chriſt, by whome the father hath ſet heauen gate wyde open.

To be briefe, like as ſin is a certain death of the ſoule, and the forewarning of eternall death: euen ſo is innocencie a certayne life of the ſoule, and the beginning of eternal life.

In the meane tyme, after hys exaumple, you alſo being engraffed to Chriſt through baptiſme, are dead to your ſinnes and wickednes: wherein as long as you liued vngodly, you were dead in dede, for aſmuche as you had affyaunce in nothing, but noyſome ſhadowes of good thinges, wherwith this worlde for a tyme diſceaueth ſuche, as wantyng the<note place="margin">In the chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe.</note> ſpirite of God, are lead by the ſpirite of Satan, whoſe tirannye in the meane while is permitted ouer this lower element.

For albeit the law reſtrayned vs from the wur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Images, yet our lyfe was altogether defyled with noyſome luſtes of corporall thynges, by the enforcemente whereof, we paſſed of the tyme, not doyng thoſe thynges, whiche the holy ghoſte commaunded, but thoſe that our owne mynde, geuen to filthie affectes, bad vs doe.

euerye one muſte haue nede of an others offyce, ſo that one maye not contemne an other. But this diſtribucion of gyftes, dependeth not of vs, but of the wyll of God, who diſtributeth vnto euerye man leſſe or more as it ſemeth expedient in his owne ſyghte. There is no cauſe, why he ſhoulde bee diſdeyned, that hath leſſe, nor why he ſhoulde exalte hymſelfe, that hathe more. That one is after Goddes meaſuryng, thys other is after Goddes plenteous enlargyng, and all by Chriſte, which geueth alſo theſe thynges equally with the father. Certaynly this is the thyng y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Pſalmiſte by the inſpiracion of the holy goſt ſpake of ſo long agoe. For Chriſte hauyng all ready conquered the helles, is aſcended alyue agayne into the hygh kyngdome of the father, and hath caryed with him the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of his conqueſte, euen the flocke of vs myſerable captiues, whom he hath frely deliuered from the tyranny of the deuyl and ſynne. And from thence, of the fathers liberalitie, he hathe geuen throughe the holye ghoſte ſoondrye kyndes of gyftes, and beſtowed them among menne, as it is the ſolemne manner of ſuche as wynne the maiſtrye in a tryumphe, to throwe downe tokens of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphe abrode among the people. He ſente downe giftes from heauen and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly thynges they were, that he ſente. To be briefe, where it is ſayed: he aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, doeth it not conſequently folowe, that he before deſcended? And there is no deſcencion but from aboue: ſo that the deſcencion is before, and the aſcencion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For none deſerueth worthelye to bee exalted on hyghe, but onelye throughe lowlineſſe and humbleyng of hymſelfe. To conclude, after moſte lowe hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyng, foloweth moſte hygh aduauncing. From the moſte hyghe heauen, than the whiche nothyng can be higher, Chriſt deiected himſelf euen vnto the helles, than the which nothyng can be lower. And for this cauſe ſake he was worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exalted aboue the higheſte of all the heauens, and ſo tooke his bodily preſence out of oure ſyghte, to the intente to accompliſhe all thynges from aboue wyth heauenly giftes, and after an other maner of reaſon, to be now more effectually preſente with vs, than whan he was conuerſaunt emong vs vpon earth. He forſoke not his body, but deuyded his gyftes vnto euery of his membres, after ſuche wyſe, as none of them all ſhould want anye thyng, albeeit ſome were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with more excellent giftes than ſome. For ſome he would haue to be chief, as Apoſtles, ryng leaders &amp; autours of the Goſpel preahing, &amp; ſome to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes that coulde expounde the hidde meanynges of Moſes lawe, ſome to be euangeliſtes to occupye the Apoſtles roumes, and to carrye aboute the goſpell from place to place. And ſome to be paſtours and doctours, as byſhoppes, to feede the flocke of Chriſte, with the meate of holy doctryne, and holſome exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of goodlyfe. And the teſte he inſtructed, ſome with one gyfte and ſome with an other, to the intente, that of all theſe conferred together, the coumpanye of ſaynctes ſhoulde bee perfeitelye conſummate and furnyſhed, to the vſe of euerye good offyce: and that the perfeit bodye of Chriſte beyng fully growen together in all his menbres, ſhoulde ſo bee cheriſhed one with the ſuccour of an other, and that the ſtronger membre ſhoulde beate for the tyme with the weaker, and the weaker marke and folowe the exaumple of the ſtronger, vntill we maye all at length cumme to equall ſtrength of fayth, and with lyke perfeccion knowe the ſonne of God, throughe whoſe helpe we maye waxe bygge and luſtye in the ſecrete encreaſe of mynde, after ſuch ſorte, that at length we may growe vnto a perfeit manne, and accordyng to oure meaſure, frame oure ſelues aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably

And ſo it becommeth the houſebandes to be lykewiſe affected to wardes theyr wiues, that they leaue nothing vndone, whereby they maye make theyr wines perfite Chriſtian woomen, and to bee no leſſe carefull for their wyues healthe, than the head is carefull for the health of the bodye.

Correcte the faulres, ſo as thou loue thy wife neuertheleſſe for all that. For what would the head doe, yf it ſee his bodye be full of ſickenes or diſeaſe? would it beginne to hate it, and for ſake it? or rather heale it, if it coulde, and if it coulde by no meanes heale it, yet at leaſt beare with<note place="margin">He that Loueth his wife loueth himſelf.</note> it, and cheriſhe it? Might it not be thought a great abſurditie, if the head would wiſhe euill to his owne bodye? He that loueth his wyfe, loueth hymſelf, for ſhe is parte of hymſelfe: what man had euer ſo litle felyng of the ſenſes of nature, to hate his owne bodye? What man dooeth not rather nouriſhe and cheriſhe hys bodye, what a maner a one ſo euer it bee, to make it better and luſtier? Seyng that the very Ethnikes doe naturally no leſſe than ſo, why doeth not Chriſtian charitie worke the ſame in vs a great deale more, inaſmuche as we are moued thereunto by the exaumple of Chriſte, who did not forſake his wife the congres gacion (though ſhe was diſteyned before tyme, many ſondry wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>yes, and a very whoriſhe naughty packe) but he clenſed her, he pyked her, and made her perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trimme in euery poynt. Therefore, you houſe bandes doe the ſame vnto your wyues, that Chriſte hath dooen vnto vs, that are the membres of his body, whiche is the congregacion, lyke as the wyfe is the bodye of the houſebande, of whoſe fleſhe and bones ſhe is made, to thintente it maye be manifeſtlye knowen, that that thyng oughte in no wyſe to bee diuorced aſondre that is all one ſelfe ſame thing. For thus we reade in the booke of Geneſis. For the wyues ſake, man ſhal rather forſake father and mother, than forſake his wyfe: vnto whom he ſhall ſo kepe hymſelfe, that of twoo there bee made one, in moſte perfite cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling together both of bodies and ſoules.

And on the other ſide, let reuerent feare holde vnder the lower ſort, ſo as through to much ſufferaunce they waxe not rebellious. For there can no concorde nor quietnes poſſibly be, where all is hauocke without ordre. Ouer the wyfe the huſband onely hath autoritie.

And to be briefe, the very lawe of god commaundeth the ſame, and ſayeth: honour thy father &amp; thy mother. And it was not inough to geue that commaundement, as it doth in the other commaundementes. Thou ſhalt doe no murther. Thou ſhalt not ſteale. &amp;c.

They are children, and not bonde ſeruauntes. Let gentlenes mitigate auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. You muſt beware that through waiwardnes of your old age, or through ſtrayt dealing, or immoderate frowardnes, you amend them not, but prouoke their ſtomakes to bee wurſe.

And the duetie that other doe to their maiſters, vnto whom they are boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den after the temporall condicion of ſeruitude, loke you on your behalfe doe it much more aboundauntly. For the office of baptiſme is not to geue this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that you ſhoulde bee in bondage no more, but that you ſhoulde dooe youre bounden ſeruice the more diligently: nor that your will ſhoulde be to diſdayne your maiſters, becauſe they are become brethren with you in profeſſion, but ſo muche the more you ought to haue them in reuerence, and be the more afrayde to offend them: Nor do not, as the common ſorte of ſeruauntes doth, your due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for feare, and in your mynde curſe them and watche them: but with an vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right ſincere conſcience obey them, conſidering this with your ſelf, that you do this duetie vnto Chriſt, vnto whoſe wil you are obedient, although peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture your maiſters deſerue not that obedience. By this meanes ſhall it come to paſſe, that you ſhall not be lyke to the common trade of ſeruauntes, that dooe theyr maiſters commaundementes, while they be preſently in ſyght, for feare of diſpleaſure. But aſſone as they thynke no body ſeeth them, than they wil do as they luſte. In dede thys is to ſerue vnto the eye and not of a conſcience, and nothing elles but to couet to pleaſe men and not Chriſte. In whoſe ſyghte no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is acceptable, that is counterfayetly done or els by coaccion. But be you as it becummeth the ſeruauntes of Chriſte, hartely and faythfully curteous &amp; diligent in your dueties doing towardes your mayſters, not becauſe neceſſitie enforceth you, but becauſe God ſo willeth you. And ſee you alienate not your ſelues from doing your dueties, albeit you haue croked and wieked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to your maiſters. For in dede it is an expediente forwardenes of the Goſpell, that you ſhoulde be curteous vnto them, ſo that your obedience turne not vnto vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. And conſidre with your ſelues, that you doe that vnto Chriſt, that you doe vnto them for the Goſpels ſake, and that you doe it vnto God, and not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, inaſmuche as you doe it to men for the loue of God. And in caſe you winne them vnto Chriſte, through your diligence, it is a righte well beſtowed duetie. But and if they ſhew themſelues vnthankeful, yet know you for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie, that no man ſhall loſe the rewarde of his well doing. And although he ſhal not receiue it at mans hand, yet he ſhall once vndoubtedly receyue it of the lord, not onely the bondman but alſo the freeman, whatſoeuer good turne he ſhall hartely beſtow vpon an vnthankeful man. Now to conclude, like as thoſe bondſeruauntes that profeſſe Chriſte ought to be ſo much the more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto their maiſters, euen ſo is it requiſite, that chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maiſters be the more gentle in commaunding their ſeruauntes, and in their behauiours to vſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues

in ſuch wiſe, as they may appeare, to couet rather to be loued then fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and to be hartely louing vnto theyr bond ſeruauntes, inaſmuch as they be receiued into the felow ſhip of brethren: and not alwayes ready to threate and to beate, as the common ſorte of maiſters is accuſtomed to doe. Let your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes perceiue, that you are become the more gentle by reaſon of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, ſo as they alſo may the rather be allured vnto that profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as wel as you, if peraduenture they haue not yet alredy profeſſed: and conſidre, that maiſters autoritie is but a temporali thing and onely eſtabliſhed by mans lawe: And for all that it becummeth not vs in any wiſe to diſturbe it: yet neuertheles there is no reſpect of perſons with god. For he maketh neuer a whit the leſſe of any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> becauſe he is a bonde ſeruaunte, nor maketh the more of any manne, becauſe he is a gentleman borne. According to mans lawes, you maiſters haue power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer your ſeruauntes vpon earth, but for all that in the meane tyme you haue a maiſter in heauen as well as they.

For we haue not warre and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayl with men, whoſe wronges our duetie is to ouercome with pacyence.

And ſo in like caſe, you that haue ſpiritual battayl, with wicked ſpirites continually, in ſteede of the girdle, put on trueth to girde vp the loines of your mynde, ſo as you ſtande vpryghte and ſhrynke not at any naughtie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticement of falſe goodes and falſe opinions.

And if you haue alſo with this buckler, the helmet of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilaunt mynde, that can take good circumſpect hede, you nede not in any wiſe to be afraid of your health. Finally, haue alwaies in your right hand the ſword of the ſpirite, aſwel to cut of naughtie luſtes from your mindes, and to pearce to the inwarde partes of the harte, as alſo to kepe of the reſiſtours of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels veritie, and to ſuppreſſe falſe head, that trueth may preuayle. This ſworde is the worde of God, that pearceth with a conſtaunt power of fayth, not after the maner of mannes cutting reaſon, but rather renneth through than cutteth.

                     <p>Therfore it ſtandeth vs in hande to pray alway vnto him with continual ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicacions, and to deſyre this of him from the bottome of our hartes, without ceaſſing in our praiers day and night, that al ſaintes may haue the vpper hand by this ſweorde of the ſpirite. And it is alſo your duetie, to helpe me with your prayers, and to beſeche God that he would geue me plenteous vtteraunce of the goſpel, whanſoeuer I ſhall preache it: and that it would pleaſe him to vſe my mouth as an inſtrument vnto his owne glory, and to your ſaluacion, ſo as I may boldly and without ſhrinking declare vnto al men the miſtical doctrine of the goſpel, wherunto all men are called indifferently. And that I be not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by ſuche as labour by all poſſible meanes, that the glorye of the Goſpell ſhould not be ſpred abrod, for the doing wherof, I am made an embaſſadour, yea euen now being laden with chaynes, and ſuffering excedingly, that I may boldely goe about the office committed vnto me. And that this mind may ſtill perſeuer with me vnto the ende, and that by the helpe of Chriſte, I may freely ſpeake, as it becummeth me to ſpeake. For it is a rebuke for a preacher of the goſpel to be afrayd of anything, that ſhould hinder him from doyng the office of the goſpell. To conclude, as concernyng the ſtate of myne owne thinges, &amp; howe the matter ſtandeth with me here, you ſhall knowe all of Tichicus my welbeloued brother, and not a brother onely for the ſinceritie of his fayth, but alſo a miniſter and an helper in the goſpels buſineſſe: whome I haue ſent vnto you for this purpoſe, that you might know certainly in what ſtate we are, and that you ſhould be much cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted by his beyng there, leſt your hartes ſhould be diſcouraged through myne affliccions. For I am ſo tyed and bounde, that the goſpell of Chriſt doeth triumphe, notwithſtanding, euen out of the prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. My prayer is, that peace and mutual loue ioyned with ſincere fayth, may be vnto al the brethren. Of faith ſpringeth charitie, &amp; charitie nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth concord. Theſe thre with proſperous procedyng, graunt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you God the father, and the lorde Ieſus Chriſte. The loue and merciful goodneſſe of God be for euer with all them that with an vnfained conſcience and vnſpotted life, loue the lorde Ieſus Chriſte: and deſpyſyng the tranſitory tryfles of this worlde, folowe the thynges that are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and heauenly.

               <head>¶ The Argument vpon the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of Saint Paule the Apoſtle to the Philippians. By D. Eraſmus or Roterdaine.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Philippians are in the firſt parte of Macedonia, as it is declared in the. xvi. of the Actes, a people deducted oute of the citie of Philippos, ſo called of Philip the buyldour of it. And Theſſalonica is the head citie of the Philippians, whiche are worthilye muche prayſed of the Apoſtle, bicauſe they perſiſted conſtauntlie in the faythe, after they once receyued it: and woulde not allowe the falſe apoſtles among them, wheras the Corinthians and Galathians had receyued them and geuen credence vnto them. Unto theſe Philippians, Paule beyng warned of the holy ghoſt wente and taried among them a good maynye of dayes, not without greate trauayll. For there Paule was ſcourged with whippes, and was caſte with Silas in to pryſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at which tyme the keper of the priſon and all his houſehold were Baptized. In this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was alſo Lydia the purpleſeller, who fyrſt beyng co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted receaued Paule into her houſe. There alſo the ſouldiours, knowing that Paule was a cetezen of Rome, deſired him of theyr owne mynde, to goo whither he woulde: and ſo the name of Chriſte was notified abroade with luckye proſperous ſucceſſe.</p>
               <p>And alſo whan Paule was in priſon at Rome, theſe Philippians ſent to hym ſuche thynges, as were neceſſarie for him to lyue with by Epaphroditus: as they had doon afore, whan he was at Theſſalonica, as he him ſelfe witneſſeth in this Epiſtle. For the whiche hauyng ſet them forthe with prayſes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendacions, he exhorteth them to perſeuer and goo forewarde, ſhewyng them, that they ought to reioyce euen in thoſe afflictions, which make for the aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cement of Chriſtes goſpel: and that he was not onely not afrayed of death, but alſo that he woulde gladlye wiſhe it, yf Chriſt ſo would. Than he gyueth them a ſpeciall exhortacion to mutuall concorde, whiche can not poſſible be amonge ſuche as be ſtoute ſtomaked. And becauſe they ſhoulde be the better content, he promyſeth to ſende Tymotheus vnto them, and that he will come againe to them ſhortlye him ſelfe. In the meane tyme he ſendeth Epaphroditus, whiche was amended of his extreme daungerous ſickeneſſe. Theſe he treateth of, in the two firſt chapters, for in the thyrd he confirmeth theyr conſciences againſt the falſe apoſtles, alluryng men euery where vnto the Iewyſhe ſecte: whom he calleth dogges, the workers of wickednes, the enemyes of Chriſtes croſſe, and makyng their belyes their god, and in no place he is more apertely ſtomaked againſt them than in this Epiſtle. The fourth chapter is ful of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendacions and ſalutacions, but onely that he intermingleth certain monicions here and there by the way, and thanketh the Philippians for their liberall gentilneſſe ſhewed towardes him. This epiſtle he wrote from the citie of Rome by Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditus, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was layed the ſeconde tyme in priſon: for after his firſte de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe he was leadde agayne in to priſon: wherof he maketh reporte in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to Tymothee.</p>

                     <q>I thanke my God with al remembraunce of you alwayes in al my prayers for you, &amp;  praye with gladnes: becauſe ye are come into the felowſhip of the goſpel fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the friſt day vnto now: And am ſurely certified of this, that he which hath begonne a good worke in you, ſhall performe it vntil the day of Ieſus Chriſt: as it beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth me, ſo iudge I of you al, becauſe I haue you in my berte: for aſmuche as ye all are companyons of grace wyth me, euen in my bondes, and in the defendyng and ſtablyſhynge of the goſpel. For God is my recorde howe greatlye I longe after you all, from the very hart rote in Ieſus Chriſt.

                     <p>Verely as often as I call vpon God in my prayers, as I doo in dede with out ceaſſyng, I make continuall mention of you all, with rendryng of than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes and excedyng reioycyng on all your behalfes, that euer ſynce the fyrſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traunce of your profeſſion, euen vnto this daye, in that you haue releued me wyth your helpe and gentilnes, you haue ſhewed youre ſelues to be of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhyppe of the goſpel.

Whether waye ſo euer happeneth vnto me, I ſhalbe in ſure ſauegarde. And as for death, I am not onely not afrayed of it, but I thynke it alſo rather to be wyſhed for, yf it myghte be to the ſpedye furtheraunce of the ghoſpell. And yet I am not wearye to lyue, thoughe, I lyue in thys payefull eſtate, for I meaſure all the felicitie of my lyfe, by the ſucceſſe of the ghoſpell. And on the other parte, I am not affrayed of death. For it ſhalbe my vauntage, and brynge me to the ioyes of heauen, where after thys lyfe I ſhall truely lyue. And yet in the meane tyme, thys vyle corporall lyfe wanteth not his frute, foraſmuche as in amplyfyinge of good dedes, the rewarde of immortalitie is amplyfyed alſo, and beſydes that whyle we lyue in thys worlde, the ghoſpell of Chriſte is ſet forwarde and confirmed throughe oure trauayll.

For he longed after you all, and was full of heuyneſſe, becauſe that ye had hearde ſaye, that he had bene ſicke. And no doubte he was ſicke, in ſomuche that he was nye vnto death. But god had mercye on hym: and not on hym onelye, but on me alſo, leſte I ſhoulde haue ſorowe vpon ſorowe. I ſente hym therefore the more dylygently that when ye ſee hym, ye maye reioyce agayne, and that I maye be the leſſe ſorowfull. Receynt hym therefore in the Lorde wyth all gladneſſe, and make muche of ſuche, becauſe that for the worke of Chriſt he weute ſo farre, that he was nye vnto deathe, and regarded not his lyfe: to fulfyll that which was lackyng on your part towarde me.</q>
                     <p>Furthermore I thoughte thys alſo veray requiſite, that Epaphroditus, who is bothe my brother, and companyon and felowe ſouldier, and youre Apoſtle, ſhoulde beare Tymotheus companye vnto you, to the entente he myghte be commendablye welcome vnto you bothe for my ſake and for youre owne: who alſo broughte vnto me youre louyng charitie, wherwith you are wonte to releue me at my nedes. He was a good while a goe muche deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to come ſee you, and was wonderfully afrayed, leſt it greued you to ſore, to heare tell that he was ſo perylouſlye ſycke. It was true that you hearde ſaye, for he was ſo ſooze ſycke, that he was in ieoperdye of hys lyfe, and vearye lyke to haue dyed. But God reſtored hym agayne, and had compaſſyon vpon hys ſeruaunte, and not vpon him onelye, but alſo vpon me (that was in ieoperdye, whan he was in ieoperdye) leſte vpon the ſorowe, that I conceaued by his ſickeneſſe, I ſhould haue had double ſorowe, for the death of ſo faythfull a felowſouldyour. And therfore I was the more diligent to ſende hym vnto you, ſpecyally, that you myghte be glad to ſee hym well amended agayne, and peraduenture not beleue the tale as it was tolde you: than that all my ſorowe maye be wyped cleane oute of my mynde, yf I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue you vnfeynedlye ioyous and glad of hys welfare.</p>
                     <p>Receyue hym therefore with a louynge Chriſtian affection in all ioyfulnes: and haue not hym in price onely, but all them alſo that are lyke him.

                     <q>¶ Moreouer (brethren) reioyce ye in the Lorde. It greueth me not to wryte one thing often to you. For to you it is a ſure thing. Beware of dogges, beware of euyll worckers. Beware of diſſencion. For we are circumciſion whiche ſerue God in the ſpirite, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in Chriſt Ieſu, and haue no confidence in the fleſſhe: though I might alſo reioyce in the fleſſhe. Yf eny other man thincketh that he hath wherof he might truſt in the fleſſhe: I haue more: beyng circumciſed the cyght daye, of the kynred of Iſraell, of the try be of Beniamin, an Hebrue borne of the Hebrues: as concernyng the lawe, a Phariſaye: as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng feruentnes, I perſecuted the congregacion, as touchinge the right wyſnes which is in the lawe, I was vnrebukeable. But the thinges that were vauntage vnto me, thoſe I counted loſſe for Chriſtes ſake. Yee I thynke all thinges but loſſe for the excellencye of the knowledge of Chriſt Ieſu my Lorde. For whome I haue counted all thing loſſe, and do iudge them but vyle, that I maye wynne Chriſte, and be founde in him, not hauynge myne owne tyghteweſnes of the lawe: but that which is thorow the faith of Chriſt: euen that righte weſnes whiche commeth of God thorowe faith, that I maye knowe him and the veriue of his reſurreccion, and the felowſhyppe of his paſſions, while I am confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable vnto his (death) yf by eny meanes I might attaine vnto the reſurreccion of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> deed. Not that I haue attained vnto it already, or that I am already perfect: but I folowe, yf that I maye comprehende that, wherin I am comprehended of Chriſt Ieſu. Brethren, I counte not my ſelfe that I haue gotten it as yet: but this one thing I ſaye: I forget thoſe thinges whiche are behynde, and endeuoure my ſelfe vnto thoſe thinges whiche are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and (accordynge to the marke appoynted) I preace to the rewarde of the hye cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge of God thorowe Chriſt Ieſu. Let vs therefore as many as be perfect, be thus wyſe mynded: and yf ye be other wyſe mynded, God ſhall open the ſame alſo vnto you. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, vnto that whiche we haue attayned vnto, let vs proceade by one rule, that we maye be of one accorde.</q>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow brethren, this remayneth moreouer, that whan you knowe what thinges are doen here, and hauing Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditus ſent to you againe in health, you maye reioyce: and neglectinge the affliccions, wherwith the world hath turmoiled vs, you may be glad, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> our lord Ieſus Chriſtes buſyneſſe goeth alwayes forwarde better and better: On the behalfe wherof I am not ſo muche afrayed of them that be Ethnikes, whiche impugne the goſpell openly, as of theſe halfe chriſtians, whiche preache Chriſte after ſuche wyſe, that they myngle the Iewes maner of doctrine, in withall. Of this matter, I haue with muche carke and care oftentymes warned you, but yet it ſhall be no payne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, to put the ſame in wryting that you maye be more ſure. For you can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooſt neuer be ware ynoughe of theſe peſtilent wycked, ſhameles kynde of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that alwayes lye in wayte in euery place.

They bragge of their foreſkynnes circumciſion, whan their inwarde mynde is all together vncircumciſed. Beware brethren, that they begyle you not, take hede of ſuch dogges, take hede of naughtye workers, beware of the vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyſed circumciſion, yea rather conciſion. They haue no cauſe to bragge of them ſelues, though they beare about the fylthy marke of their highe bragge, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as their conſcience is vncleane and wicked. If circumciſion be worthye y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, we are circumciſed in dede, we are very Iewes in dede, we are the ryghte children of Abraham, that worſhyp God, not with beaſtes bloude but in ſpirite (for ſo he woulde be wourſhypped:) we boaſte not in the lytell ſkynne cut from a parte of the bodye, nor yet in Moſes, but in Chriſt Ieſus, who, by his ſpirite, hath cut awaye all our ſynnes from our ſoules, and hathe prynted in our har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes a very excellente goodlye marke, wherby it maye manifeſtlye appeare that we are the ſonnes of God. This nowe is a glorious and a true circumciſion.
<pb facs="tcp:7459:181"/>
God from hence forthe eſtemeth not man after the ſtate of his bodye. But theſe men neclecting the care of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoule, repoſe al their whole truſt in the fleſhe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in yf any man maye boaſte, I for my parte wyll geue place in this behalfe to none of them all: ſo as they can not haue, to quarell, that I ſet naught by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> becauſe I haue it not. If any man ſtande in his owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceite bicauſe of his circumciſion, I maye bragge of my ſelfe a greate deale more, for I was lawfully circumciſed the eyght daye accordynge to the commaundement of the lawe. I am an Iſraelite, not by engraffynge, but by kyndred: not a ſtraunge foundlyng, but a Iewe, beynge borne of the Iewes: and not of an vncertayne kyndred, but of a ſpecial chiefe kynored, that is, of Beniamin, whiche hath ben alwayes ioyned to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> tribe of Iuda, wherof Kynges and Leuites and prieſtes alſo are ordayned: wher as many ſuppoſe them ſelues Iſraelites, bycauſe they deſcende of the kyndred of the concubines of Iſrael. I am an Hebrewe of the Hebrewes, after my birthe, and after the ſectes of the law, a Phariſee, whoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre hathe had alwayes the higheſt dygnitie. And yf they wyll eſteme any man after the ſtudye and obſeruacion of the lawe: they haue not alſo in any of theſe, wherin to preferte themſelues before me. For I regarded the dyligent ſtudy of the lawe of my fathers ſo earneſtlye muche, that for the defence of it, I perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the congregacion of Chriſt by all poſſyble meanes I coulde: and I ſo enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erlye obſerued thoſe thinges, that the lawe commaundeth, that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge, wherin I coulde be iuſtlye founde withall, as a tranſgreſſour. And yf any of this geare deſerued any prerogatyue, I might with iuſter cauſe boaſt, than theſe men, that woulde ſeme to be halfe goddes, becauſe they be circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. At that time in dede, foraſmuch as I was not yet taught Chriſt, I thought my ſelfe a iolye fortunate man, aſwell for the nobylitie of my kyndred, and dignitie of my ſecte, as alſo for my ſitayte obſeruyng of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> law.

I take myne owne ryghteouſneſſe to be nothing worthe (where in obſeruyng of Moſes lawe, my ryghteouſneſſe was thought among men to haue ben muche auayleable) ſo that I maye atteyne vnto true righteouſnes: which I may not call myne, foraſmuch as it is not got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by our owne merites, but frelye geuen to them, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> dyſtruſt them ſelues, &amp; put their whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fydence ſymplye in Chriſt.

But that righteouſnes, whiche is geuen of god, is ſo not ours, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandynge it geueth vs true perfite ſaluacion, in caſe we beleue the goſpel, and through faith come to the knowledge of Ieſus Chriſt, whoſe natiuitie is more wanderful, than can be vnderſtanden by any mortall mannes wyſedom: whoſe reſurrection is of more power, than can be perſwaded by any argumentes of man. Onlye faith is hable to perſwade theſe vnto vs, and hathe ſo perſwaded in dede, that beyng eſtablyſhed in the hope of the promyſſes, I am gladly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to come vnto the felowſhyp of his affliccions, to be bounden and to dye for his goſpelles ſake, lyke as he was beaten and crucified for vs: that it maye by ſome meanes chaunce vnto me, that lyke as I folowe the example of hys death, ſo I maye come to the glory of his reſurrection, beyng rayſed vp by him. This mooſt certaine conſtaunt hope doeth ſo comforte me in theſe afflictions, bycauſe I aſſuredly truſt in the promyſſes of Chriſte, who hath promyſed the feloweſhyp of his kyndome to them, that wyll not ſhrynke from the felowſhyp of his croſſe.

For many walke (of whome I haue tolde you often, and nowe tell you wepynge) that they are the enemyes of the croſſe of Chriſte, whoſe ende is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacion, whoſe bellye is their God and glory to their ſhame, which are worldly minded. But our conuerſacion is in heauen, from whence we lake for the ſauiour, euen the Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, whiche ſhall chaunge our vyle body, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he maye make it lyke vnto his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious body: accordyng to the workyng, wherby he is able alſo to ſubdue all thinges vnto him ſelfe.</q>
                     <p>Now whyle we are in this worlde, let vs goo on ſtyll in the race, that we haue taken in hande, accordynge to the rule preſcribed vnto vs: and let vs truely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in it, that we ſuffre not oure ſelues, to be drawne backe from that purpoſe: but let vs make ſpedye haſte, euery man to his power, to atteine the game of immortalitie. Ther be ſome, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> kepe not the race a right, them it is not good to folowe. But rather folowe me: for I runne ſtreyght to the goſpelles game. And marke them, that you ſee treade forwarde after the example of vs. Chriſt hath ſet vs the beſt facion of example, after the whiche you ſee me preace to the ſame place, that he went vnto. All they that runne in this race, wyune not the game: and therfore it is not good folowing of euery one, that runneth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For there be very many, whome I haue oftentymes tolde you of before, and now I tell you againe with wepyng teares, that preache Chriſt after ſuch ſorte, that they are the enemyes of Chriſtes croſſe for all that. For they wyll in no wyſe folowe the example of his lyfe and deathe, to the intent they may euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtinglye lyue with him: but for their owne lucre and vayne gloryes ſake, in ſtede of true godlyneſſe they teache Iewyſhe obſeruations, circumciſion of the foreſkynne, choyſe of meates, dyfference of dayes, to the intent, that other men beyng burthened with theſe wares, they them ſelues maye reigne and lyue at eaſe for all that, as though after this lyfe they loked after none other. But let the ende of them fraye vs awaye from their condicions. For lyke as through ſlaunderous reproche of man, we drawe to eternall glorye, and by afflictions of this world, preace vnto immortall felicitie: euen ſo they by tranſitorye plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the worlde, procure to them ſelues euerlaſtyng deſtruction, bycauſe in ſtede of God they honour their belye that can not helpe them: and by countre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faicte vayne glorye among men, whiche they repoſe not in Chriſte, but in thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that they ought to be aſhamed of, they make ſpede to euerlaſtynge ſhame. For what ſoeuer is earthly, is but temporall and countrefayte? and what ſo euer is heauenly, is true and euerlaſtynge. But they ſtudye for nothynge elles but thoſe thinges that are of the earthe. In them they repoſe their glorye, in them they ſet their pleaſure, in them they put theyr hope of helpe, and ſo runne aſtraye ferre from the marke of the goſpell. But we, that folowe Chriſt aright, though our bodyes be deteyned vpon earthe, yet in ſoule our conuerſacion is in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſighing continuallye thither, as our head is gonne afore, from whence alſo through faythe we loke for our lorde Ieſus Chriſt, whiche ſhall rayſe vs from death, and delyuer vs poſſeſſion of thoſe thinges, that he promyſeth vs: and ſhall tranſforme this vyle naughtye bodye of ours, and make it lyke vnto his owne glorious bodye, for this conſyderacion, that the membres, which wer felowes of his afflictions in this worlde, ſhoulde be called there into the felow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyp of hys felicitye. This matter ſhall not ſeme vncredible to any man, that wyll dyligentlye pondre the great power of him, that ſhall doo this dede.

Be careful for nothinge, but in all prayer and ſupplycacion let youre pericyons be manifeſt vnto God with geuynge of thanckes.

But care for this onely, that whan Chriſte ſhall come, he maye fynde you readyly prepared: of him depende you entierlye with all youre hartes. Yf you haue nede of any thinge, truſte not to the helpe of the worlde, but call vpon god with continuall ſupplicacions, and make your moane to him with feruent deſires, whan you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any thing.

For I haue not taught you, but as I haue done my ſelfe in dede. Loke therefore, that you haue not onely theſe thinges in your remembraunce, but doo them alſo in dede, accordinge as you ſee example in vs. And to ſuche as doo thus, God that is the authour of peace, wyll be ready with his preſente helpe, where as he is at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde with none, but thoſe that are folowers of vertues. To be briefe, it pleaſed my mynde excedynglye, that your accuſtummed louyng charitableneſſe towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des me, (whiche was entermitted for a ſmall ſpace,) encreaced againe, &amp; was as freſhe as euer it was towardes me. Howbeit your good wil was not ſlaked, but though it were as louynge as euer it was, yet you wanted oportunitie to ſende the thinges that you woulde haue done. Wherefore I am glade, not ſ muche for myne owne commoditie, as for your louinge kyndeneſſe, wherby I reioyce, that you are made worthilye acceptable to God. For it moueth me not muche, that my poore penurie is releued by your good liberalitie. For I am not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted nor vnſkylled in thoſe matters: bycauſe I haue ben a greate deale practiſed in learnyng to ſuffre theſe incommodities patientlye. I haue learned to be content with my preſente fortune whatſoeuer it be. I can be poore and baſſe amonge the poore, and I haue learned to excede amonge the riche.

Nether wealth maketh me highe, whan I haue more than Inede: nor want dyſcourageth me, thoughe I haue leſſe than is neceſſarye for me to lyue withal. For why ſhould theſe thinges greue my ſtomake, ſeyng that I paſſe not vpon fetters and whyppes for the goſpelles ſake? There is neuer a one of theſe, but I can ſuffre them patientlye ynoughe without grefe of ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, beyng confirmed and ſtrengthened by Ieſus Chriſte, throughe whoſe ayde I am ſtronge, wheras of my ſelfe I am nothing. Neuertheleſſe I meane not by theſe wordes, as thoughe I ſet no ſtoore by your kynde lyberalitie, but I excedyngly commende your godlyneſſe, in that you haue planted your ſelues in to the felowſhyp of myne afflicitions: for the whiche, God ſhal alſo make you partakers of my rewardes.

Them had not the Apoſtle Paul him ſelfe ſeen, as whiche were inſtructed in the fayth of Chriſt, either by the preachyng of Archippus, or (as S. Ambroſe ſayth) of Epaphras, who were with this matter put in truſt. In great leopardy were theſe people by reaſon of falſe Apoſtles, whiche labored to bryng them into a very peſtilent opinion, teachyng them that the ſonne of God was not the meane and author of ſaluacion, but that al menne haue acceſſe and entrie vnto the father by the healpe of Angels. Theſe men ſayd further that foraſmuche as in the tyme of the olde teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all thynges were done by the miniſtery and ſeruice of Angels, that Chriſt the ſonne of God was neither comen doune into the yearth, nor would come.

Them biddeth Paule to remembre theyr profeſſion, euidently declaryng that whatſoeuer they had vntil that tyme obtained, was geuen vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by none Angel, but by Chriſt the creator of Angels, that he onely was head of the churche, and that ſaluacion ſhuld at nomans hand be ſought for, but at his, in whiche treatiſe he alſo defendeth his owne authoritie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuche as laboured to empayre it.

All whiche pointes Paule in the two fyrſt chapiters entreateth of. In the other two he exhorteth them to vertuous and godly liuyng, namely geuyng rules, how the wife ſhould vſe her ſelfe towarde her huſband, how the huſband againe ſhould vſe his wife, after what ſorte the father ſhould be towarde his children, and the children likewyſe towarde theyr fathers, the ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Coloſſians are a people of Aſia the leſſe, dwellyng nigh vnto the Laodicians. Them had not the Apoſtle Paul him ſelfe ſeen, as whiche were inſtructed in the fayth of Chriſt, either by the preachyng of Archippus, or (as S. Ambroſe ſayth) of Epaphras, who were with this matter put in truſt. In great ieopardy were theſe people by reaſon of falſe Apoſtles, whiche labored to bryng them into a very peſtilent opinion, teachyng them that the ſonne of God was not the meane and author of ſaluacion, but that al menne haue acceſſe and entrie vnto the father by the healpe of Angels. Theſe men ſayd further that foraſmuche as in the tyme of the olde teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all thynges were done by the miniſtery and ſeruice of Angels, that Chriſt the ſonne of God was neither comen doune into the yearth, nor would come. Beſide this the ſame teachers with Chriſtes doctrine myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled Iewiſhnes and ſuperſticious Philoſophie, obſeruyng and kepyng certain pointes of the lawe, ſuperſticiouſly alſo honouryng the Sunne, the Moone, and ſtarres, with ſuche other ſmal trinkettes of this worlde, bearyng the Coloſſians in hand that they wer alſo bound to do the ſame. Them biddeth Paule to remembre theyr profeſſion, euidently declaryng that whatſoeuer they had vntil that tyme obtained, was geuen vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by none Angel, but by Chriſt the creator of Angels, that he onely was head of the churche, and that ſaluacion ſhuld at nomans hand be ſought for, but at his, in whiche treatiſe he alſo defendeth his owne authoritie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuche as laboured to empayre it. After whiche he geueth them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent warnyng to take hede, leſt they be deceiued with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> high wordes of falſe Apoſtles, or forged viſions of angels, and ſo by meane therof fall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Iewiſhnes, or els into the ſuperſticion of Philoſophie. All whiche pointes Paule in the two fyrſt chapiters entreateth of. In the other two he exhorteth them to vertuous and godly liuyng, namely geuyng rules, how the wife ſhould vſe her ſelfe towarde her huſband, how the huſband againe ſhould vſe his wife, after what ſorte the father ſhould be towarde his children, and the children likewyſe towarde theyr fathers, the ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The laſt part, ſauyng that he warneth Archippus of his duetie, is all ſpent in commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacions. This Epiſtle was written out of priſon in Epheſus, &amp; ſent by Tychicus, as Paule him ſelfe in this preſent epiſtles ſaieth. The latine argumentes ſhewe, that it was alſo ſent thither by One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus, for ſo him ſelfe writeth alſo in the laſt chapiter. The Greke titles recorde, that it was ſent from the cytie of Rome, and in deede thence ſent he Oneſimus, whom Paule beyng priſoner there had made a chriſtian man.</p>

For this is the wyll of God, that you kepe your ſelues holy and vnſpotted, and not onely to be chaſte in ſoule, but alſo in body, that you may abſtayne from whoredome wherwith the bodies are defiled. The body is the dwellyng houſe of the ſoule, and the ſoule is the Inne of God. Than lyke as it is neceſſarie for the ſoule to be pure, becauſe of the geaſte God: ſo is it decente for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye to be pure becauſe of the enhabitour, the ſoule. Therfore let euery one knowe howe to geue this honoure to his ſely carcas, as a frayle veſſel, that he kepe it cleane and vndefiled: and not ſuffre it to be ſpotted with the diſeaſe of filthy deſyres and luſtes: whiche thyng is ſo farre vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the ſtate of Chriſtians, that it is the ſtate of no nacion of people, but of them that haue no knowlage of God, but thinke that euery one may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully doe what he luſteth without puniſhment, and that all is honeſt that is pleaſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the body.

Let no manne therfore eyther in this caſe or in other matters, in vſurpyng ouermuche to hymſelfe, defraude his brother, inaſmuche as God wil ſuffer none of theſe thinges vnreuenged: and ſeyng that baptiſme ſhal not onely not availe them that commit theſe offences, but alſo make to their more greuouſe puniſhemente, lyke as we haue tolde &amp; recorded vnto you before.

For this ſaye we vnto you in the worde of the Lorde, that we which ſhal lyue, and ſhall remayne in the commyng of the Lorde, ſhall not come ere they which ſlepe. For the Lorde hymſelfe ſhall deſcende from heauen, with a ſhowte, and the voyce of the Archangell and trompe of God. And the dead in Chriſt ſhall aryſe fyrſt: then we whiche ſhall lyue (eucn we which ſhal remayne) ſhall be caught vp with them alſo in the cloudes, to meete the Lorde in the ayer.

But the death of chriſtians is nothyng els but a ſlepe, from the whiche they ſhall awake agayne at the commyng of Chriſt, to lyue a great deale more bliſſefully. For why ſhoulde we not truſte, the ſame thyng to come to paſſe in the membres, that we knowe alreadye perfourmed in the head? For if we beleue verely, that Ieſus was deade after y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> manier of man, &amp; roſe agayne to immortall life, it foloweth of neceſſitie, that we ought to beleue alſo, that god the father, whiche rayſed vp Ieſus, wil alſo bring with him thoſe that profeſſed Ieſus and ſlept in the aſſured truſte of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſes, alyue agayne at the commyng of his ſonne, ſo as the heade ſhal not wante his membres.

ſhal not be preſented in the ſight of Ieſus, before that they whiche were dead afore, be preſented alſo.

But it is a wondrous matter to talke of, how euyll the worlde and Chriſt agree one with the other, and how harde a thinge it is for heauenly buſynes and worldly affaires to be at one concorde. Than ſeyng it is a great weyghtye mattier to doe either of them bothe as it ſhould be, that is to ſaye, eyther to be a good byſhop or a profytable prince: what a buſye piece of worke is it for a man that is tangled bothe the wayes, ſo to ordre the mattier, that he leaue no paite of his office vndone, eyther touching his ſpiritual charge or his temporall autoritic: ſo to content his mortall prince, that he offende not the prince immortall: and ſo to be in fauour w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the courte, that he come not out of fauour in heauen? In tymes paſt who ſoeuer toke the office of a byſhop vpon him, muſt out of hande haue prepared him ſelfe wyllynglye to abyde al ſtormes of perſecucions. And yet it paſſeth my knowledge to ſaye whether there be more daungier in the tranquillytie of the worlde that now goeth, in caſe it be a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie, or in the ſtormye tempeſtes of thoſe dayes. And althoughe by reaſon of altring the ſtate of thinges, it is not poſſible that the maner of vſynge a byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes office ſhoulde be throughly in al thinges alwayes after one ſorte. And yet the thing is not to be vtterly condemned that varieth from the example of that age, nether the mutable changeinges of humayne mattiers doe alwayes permitte a byſhop to brynge to paſſe the thing that he thinketh beſt to be doen: lyke as a Maſter of a ſhyp that is bothe experte and vigilaunt doeth no good ſomtymes with ſittyng at the helme, but is caried awaye as the wynde and we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wyll: yet not withſtandynge he ſhall goe the leſſe out of the waye, from the ſyncere perfyte image of a good byſhop, that wyll haue this forme of Paule, as it were a certaine directorie alwayes before his eyes.

And althoughe a man can not doe as Paule did in al thinges yet it is ſomwhat yf he folowe his example in ſome thinges.

He preſcribeth what is comely bothe for men and for women to vſe in the open congregacion. He paynteth out what a byſhop ſhoulde be and hys houſeholde.

whom we haue gathered together vnto the goſpel: &amp; for none other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but to get a flocke of dyſciples to them ſelues, and to be had in eſtimacion among the commune people. And as for me, my ſtudye is to enlarge the demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the goſpelles poſſeſſion to the vttermooſt of my power: ſo that neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles we maye maynteyne that, that is all ready gotten.

In conſyderacion wherof, at ſuch tyme as I went againe into Macedonia about the neceſſarie affaires of the goſpel, bycauſe the Epheſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſhoulde not be vtterly deſtitute of me, I left the there eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as my ſelfe, to haue the autoritie as a notable vicegerent in ſo excellent and ſo paynefull an office. Thou ſeeſt the generall ſorte of men wonderfullye enclyned bothe to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſticion and vnto curious artes: notwithſtandyng the glorye of the goſpel is ſo muche the more highly aduaunced. And again, there be aduerſaries ſo many and ſo cruell, that we had nede to ſet both fete faſt to the grounde (as they ſaye)<note place="margin">That thou commaunde ſome.</note> that we ſtande ſtronglye againſt them. Wherfore, the thing that whan I went thence I required the to doe, the ſame beyng now abſent I eftſones beſeche and praye the to doe: that is, that thou warne ſome corrupte apoſtles there, whoſe names I paſſe ouer aduyſedly at this tyme (leſt beyng therby prouoked they waxe more ſhameles) that they defyle not ne ſubuert the pure doctrine of the goſpel that we taught to the Epheſians, with their new doctrine. And on the other parte, warne the faithfull flocke before hande, that they geue not light eare nor intendaunce to ſuche falſe apoſtles to their owne peryll, for they teache not thoſe thinges that auayle to eternall ſaluacion, and are worthye the goſpel of Chriſt, but cloute in a ſorte of vnfrutefull Iewyſhe fables, touching the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſticious conſtitucions of men, which auayle not a rote to true godlines: &amp; of a perplexe ordre of pedegree rehearſed from grandefathers, great grandefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and great great grandefathers, as thoughe the gyfte of ſaluacion taught in the goſpel, were deriued vnto vs by corporall lynage deſcending from a ſorte of degrees of ſondry auncetours: and not rather by heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly goodnes powred once vntuerſally vpon all them, that embrace the fayth of the goſpel. And this geare they preache not to the glorye of Chriſt, but partly that they them ſelues maye be had in pryce amonge you to be commended for noble doctours: partly to the intent, foraſmuche as the goſpelles doctrine is playne and ſymple, eyther to be taken for ſo muche the greater learned men, bycauſe they can cloute in a meignye of doubtefull dyfficulties that neuer can be made playne, and a ſorte of riedles that haue no expoſicion: as thoughe thoſe thinges were not mooſte beſte that are mooſt playne. The goſpel bryngeth ſaluacion to the beleuer in a ſmall towme: But this kynde of mennes doctrine bryngeth in queſtion vpon queſtion, and not onely is nothing auayleable vnto heauenly godlynes, that God geueth vs throughe faythe, but alſo it turneth vp ſyde downe the chyefe poynt of the goſpelles religion. Whoſoeuer beleueth purely, paſſeth not vpon queſtions. And he that knytteth and vnknitteth the knottes of queſtions, what other thing doeth he teache men but to ſtande in doubte? Curioſitie of queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng is an aduerſarye to fayeth. Yf they beleue God, what a doe haue they to quarell with his promyſſes? Yf the faythe and loue of the goſpel geue ſaluaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without muche a doe, to what purpoſe are mennes phantaſies myngled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all, as cuttynge of the foreſkynne, waſſhynge of handes, choyſe of meates and
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:7459:219"/>
obſeruacion of dayes? They make vaunt vnto you, that the lawe was geuen of god: and yet thoſe that teache it, teache it more greuouſly than learnedly, and vnderſtande not the ſumme nor the ende of the lawe. Wherto ſhould a man la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for ſaluacion by meanes of ſo many wiery obſeruacions, ſeyng he maye let them alone and flye ſtreight waye to the prycke it ſelfe? That ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is conyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye learned ynough in Moſes lawe, that hathe atteyned the effectes of the law. To be briefe, the thing that comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth &amp; accompliſheth al the whole efficacie of Moſes lawe in a ſhorte ſumme, is loue, in caſe it procede from a pure herte<note place="margin">The ende of the lawe is loue.</note> and an vpright conſcience and an vnfeyned faith without holownes. A perfite ſyncere loue telleth a great deale ryghtelyer, what is to be doen, than any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitucions, howe many ſoeuer they be. In caſe this loue be preſente, what nede the preſcriptes of the lawe? yf it be not preſent, what auayleth the obſeruacion of the lawe? An humayne loue, becauſe it is many times blotted with affeccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, ſtandeth many tymes with a corrupte conuerſacion, and ſomtymes comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not a full entier truſt in god. But the Euangelicall loue is of this proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that it neuer deceaueth, neuer wauereth, and can neuer ceaſſe from doynge godly. For it geueth reſpecte to none other purpoſe but to the glorye of Chriſt, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of his neighbour: ne dependeth of any other but onely of Chriſt. Of this pricke foraſmuche as ſome myſſe, therfore in ſtedde of the ſure doctrine of Chriſt, they ſtrawe abrode vayne ſmokes &amp; myſtes of Iewiſhe queſtions, to thintent they might ſeme gaye doctours of the law and ſet out them ſelues with vayne bablyng, whan they vnderſtande not for all that the ſpecialties of thoſe thinges that they ſpeake of, nor wherof they affirme. For all the whole lawe of Moſes, although it be otherwyſe dyuerſe and dyffuſe, is collected into Chriſte alone. Than ſeyng the lawe ſelfe applieth vnto Chriſt, it is ſhame for a man to profeſſe him ſelfe a doctoure of the lawe, that interpreteth the lawe contrary to Chriſtes mynde. Howbeit we ſpeake not thus, as though we condemned y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law of Moſes.</p>

I wyll not denye myne vncleaneſſe, for it redoundeth vnto the glorye of Chriſte. The leſſe that I deſerue mercye, the more excellent is his clemencye. I was worthye punyſhement. And howe commeth it to paſſe than, that Chriſt would not onely pardon myne offences and declare his excedynge gentilnes towardes me, but alſo enriche me with ſo many great free gyftes?

It is an excellent warre, that thou arte occupied in, ſee that thou applye it manfully. And that ſhalbe, in caſe thou kepe a ſyncere perfite fayth, and vnto faithe ioyne a good conſcience: that thou put no doubte in goddes promyſſes and frame thy ſelfe in vprighteneſſe of lyfe accordynge to the ſynceritie of thy iudgement. The pureneſſe of lyfe ought to be of ſuche efficacie, that it maye be not onely allowed with other men, but alſo that the conſcience maye be vpright before God. The thinges that decaye the ſtrength of faithe are humayne que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions,<note place="margin">Faith and conſcience.</note> and the appetites of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are the thinges that defile the conſcience: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thoſe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> pretende to goe about Chriſtes affaires, haue reſpecte to other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes<note place="margin">The cauſe of the decay of faith and good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> than vnto Chriſt. Fynallye theſe two clcaue ſo faſte one to the other, that yf the one be decayed, the other is in ieoperdie. For he that hathe not a ſyncere conſcience can not poſſibly haue a ſyncere faithe.

An example of this matter we haue lately ſeene to muche true (alas therfore) in Alexander and Himeneus, who inaſmuch as in the preaching of the goſpell they holde not faſte the helme of an vpright conſcience, are fallen into the rockes of Infidelitie, and beynge once fallen from the holſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion

This is not a Goſpellyke loue, but that is a goſpellyke loue, that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the godlye for Chriſt, and loueth the wycked that they maye once re pente and turne vnto Chriſt. They doe ſacrifice vnto deuylles and curſe y ou byt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlye.

This world hath his ordre, which it is not expedyent that we ſhoulde dyſquyet: ſeyng it is our duetye to procure peace in euery place. Their power and autoritie in ſome purpoſe doeth ſeruice vnto the iuſtyce of God, in that they holde vnder the euyll doers with puniſhementes, in that they kept the naughtye ones in their duetie doing, in that they put awaye robberyes, in that with their martiall powers they defende the publique peace, in that they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the commune wealthe with their lawes.

And in caſe they abuſe their power vpon vs at any tyme, it is a Chriſtian mans parte to forget the euyll turnes and remembre the good turne. In this we are bounden to their autoritie, in this we are bounde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their defence and marciall powers, yea we are rather bounden to God by them in this, that we maye be ſafe from ſedicions, ſafe from robbynge, ſafe from bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayles, and leade a quiet lyfe without trouble. It woulde doe well to haue in remembraunce, what a greate ſea of myſchiefes the hurly burly of warre bryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth in with it, and what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities peace hath in it.

And thoughe men for the mooſt parte abuſe the benefyte of peace to wycked ſenſuall purpoſes, yet for all that let vs vſe the publique peace to the ſeruing of god and integritie of honeſt manners, obeying princes in the meane ſeaſon in al thinges, that they eyther commaunde vs righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely accordinge to their office, or elles doe nothing vnto vs but make vs puny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed perſons, and not wicked perſons.

For why doe we turne Goddes ordre vp ſyde downe? Adam was made fyrſte, and than by and by was Eue made for his ſake. Than, why is that ſhameleſſye made the later, that Goddes wyll was to haue the farther? Than as concernyng the fall, Eue was the fyrſte deceaued, in that ſhe gaue credence to the ſerpent, and beyng en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed with the fayrenes of the apple, neglected the commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God. For the man could neither be deceyued with the ſerpentes promiſes, nor enticement of the apple: but the onely loue of his wife drewe him perniciouſlye to do after her.

But yet there are matiers of more weyghtye importaunce, to be loked for in thoſe that thou ſhalte thynke mete to be put in autoritye ouer the multitude. For it is conueniente, that he whiche precelleth in honor, ſhould alſo precelle in vertues. Perchaunce there be many that are deſyrous of dignitie, but for all that they weighe not with them ſelues, what carke and care dignitie hathe annexed vnto it. He that deſireth thoffice of a Byſhoppe for none other ende, but for ambicion, or for aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, or to be a tyranne, deſyreth to himſelfe a pernicious matier, and is not wel aduiſed what this word (<hi>Biſhoppe</hi>) meaneth. For this word (<hi>Biſhoppe</hi>) is not only y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> name of dignitie, but alſo y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> name of occupacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of office, &amp; of carefulnes.

So that whoſo vnderſtandeth this, &amp; deſyreth the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Byſhop, reſpectyng nothing elles but to doo good for manye, in dede his deſire is honeſt, in that he coueteth occaſion to exerciſe vertue, and not for honoure. And yet thou ſhalt not commit that offyce to any man, excepte thou perceyue hym throughly garnyſhed wyth gyftes worthy a Byſhop. And to thintent thou ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>yſt the more certaynly deſcerne thoſe gyftes, lo, I ſhall paint the out in fewe wordes the ymage of a ryght Byſhoppe. Fyrſt it behoueth him to be of ſuche vprightneſſe of lyfe, that no fauite at all can be layed to hys charge. For it is not conuenient, that he whiche profeſſeth hym ſelfe to be a teacher &amp; a requirour of innocency in other, ſhoulde not ſhewe in his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſacion and maners the ſame that he teacheth. And that he, whiche (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to the offyce that he hath taken in hande) oughte boldely and freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue them that doe amyſſe, ſhoulde commytte the thyng, wherein he maye be blamed him ſelfe. For who geueth credence to the teacher, whoſe lyfe is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to his doctrine? who wyll ſuffer to be checked of hym, in whom he ſeeth ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſame or elles more greuous offences? But that all ſhould be vpright and innocent, it is more eaſyly poſſyble to be wyſhed for, than hoped for. Yet truelye it is muche requiſite for the one man, of whoſe doctrine the people de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth, to be cleane without fault. Than in aſmuch as chaſtitie is much to be commended in a Byſhoppe, in caſe he haue not the gifte altogether to abſteine, this is to be ſpeciallye obſerued, that he haue bene or be the huſbande of one wyfe. The fyrſt mariage maye be thoughte to be ordayned for the procreation of children. But to marye agayne is not wythoute ſuſpicion of an inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent mynde euen among the Ethnikes. As for the reſte, I lette them nor from maryeng oftener than once, yf they can not abſteyne. For it is a harder matter, than I dare exacte of the whole multitude. But it becommeth a Byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe to be ſo ferre quite frome all maner of faulte, that he ſhoulde be voyde alſo of all ſuſpicion of faulte. Beſydes theſe, that one man that hathe charge ouer manye, oughte to be ſobre and vigilaunte he is the watche man, and ieo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perdie is preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t on euery ſide.

lyghteneſſe and foliſhe toying maners, that decaye and hynder the teachers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence and autoritie. And it is not ynoughe, that he ſhewe hym ſelfe gentle and courteous towardes his owne folkes, but he muſte applye hym ſelfe, that ſtraungers alſo maye haue experience of hys gentleneſſe and lyberalitie, ſo as the reporte of his honeſt name maye be the more largely ſpredde abrode. And alſo lyke as he hath theſe vertues commenly with the moſte part of men, euen ſo this is peculyarly to be required in a Biſhoppe, that he be apte and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye to teache, not Iewiſhe fables and highe ſtatelye ſwellyng Philoſophie of this woorlde, but thoſe thynges that maye make vs truelye godly ones, and ryght Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. And y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> chiefeſt office of a good teacher, is, to know what thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are the beſt to teache. Nexte this, to teache gladly, to teache ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tilly, to teache dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, to teache louyngly, to teache without ſtatelynes, to teache ſeaſonably. For the doctrine of the ghoſpell is of ſuche ſorte, that it ouercometh with ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; not with clamourus lowde ſpeakyng. And albeit for a tyme it be prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with the naughtyneſſe of them that naught are, and be enforced to ſpeake ſomthyng ſomewhat ſeuerely, yet it neuer forgetteth Chriſtian charitie. But God forbyd, that a teacher of the ghoſpell ſhoulde (after the example of ſuche as be madde wynedronken tailers) rage to intemperauntly agaynſt them that doo amyſſe, or with a ſcoldyng toungue runne throughe the heartes of them whom his duetie were rather to heale wyth fatherlye gentyleneſſe: but in all thynges leat hym remembre Chriſtian ſobrietie and temperaunce, that is a greate deale more auayleable to brynge men to amendement, than outragious crueltie is. Let him abhorre alſo from ſtryfe and contencion, that he ſeme not to do of malice, and not of loue, that, that he doeth. Charitie amendeth, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion prouoketh. And leate him abhorre couetouſnes, that he ſeme not to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaite godlynes for gaynes ſake.</p>
                     <p>Fynally, wylte thou knowe, howe he oughte to behaue himſelfe in the open publique affayres? Marke howe he doeth his owne priuate buſineſſe at home. In caſe he ſhewe hym ſelfe there a vigilaunt houſkeper, yf he kepe all thyng in ordre, yf he haue obedyent and diligent children, yf they be ſo taughte that in ſobre ſtylnes and comely manners they maye appeare to be brought vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a godly parent, it is a good hope, that he is wel hable to take the publique charge of all, that in the adminiſtration of his owne howſeholde buſynes gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ſo good a preſidence of himſelfe. For an houſeholde is no thyng elles but a ſmall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune wealthe, and the maiſter of an houſeholde, is nothing elles, but the gouernoure of a ſmall citie. And euen ſo the wiſedome of the world iudgeth them mete to haue the weyghtier affaires of a commen wealth commytted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that gouerne thynges of leſſe importaunce wyth commendacion. To conclude, how maye a man hope, that he ſhal wel gouerne the cure of the whole congregation, that can not well tell howe to gouerne his owne pryuate houſe? howe ſhall he take charge of ſo many houſes, that is not hable ynough to take charge of one? By what meanes ſhal he care for ſo great a multitude, that kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not howe to prouyde for ſo fewe?

Nowe thys is alſo to be marked in the choſyng of a Byſhoppe, not onelye howe entierly vpryghte he hathe behaued

hymſelfe in hys owne pryuate affaires, but alſo howe longe it is ſence he came to the profeſſyon of Chriſte. Baptyſme in dede engraffeth a man to the body of Chriſte, but perfite godlynes chaunceth not ſo ſodaynlye to a man. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyſme openeth the entraunce in to the congregacion, but in this caſe it remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that euery man for him ſelfe muſte ſtryue and preace to the marke of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes. Throughe baptyſme we are borne a newe: but for all that, it remayneth, that in greate proceſſe of tyme we muſte gather ſtreyngth and bygneſſe, and waxe ſtronge with daylye encreaſes of godlynes in to full growen age. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diligent hede muſt be taken, that no newe ſcholer, that is to ſaye, none that is lately called in to the felowſhyppe of faythe, be put in autoritie ouer ſo weyghtye a buſineſſe. He is a good graffe, but yet tender, and vnmete perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture to beare a greate heauy burthen. And it is Ieoperdye, leſte yf a man, that is but rawe and not yet ſuffycientlye confirmed in religion, be aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to honoure that he had not before, be puffed vp with pride, and begynne perniciouſly to ſtande in hys owne conceipte, as thoughe he were choſen in to the company of religion, for thys intent, that he myghte haue preeminence o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer relygion: and by that meanes it come to paſſe, that beyng cralled in the deuilles ſnares (which he layeth manyfoldely but none more diſceatfully than he doeth the ſnares of ambicion) and behauyng hym ſelfe to muche ſtatelye in the honour commytted vnto him, he eſcape not the myſreportes of euyll ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers: whyche wyll thus entreprete, that he couered the Chriſtian religion vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this purpoſe, that where he was but of lowe eſtate amonge his owne ſecte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he myght be in autoritie and honour among the Chriſtians. He forſoke vs in a good howre, (wyll they ſaye) he chaunged his religion for his more aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: he had leauer be a Chriſtian Byſhoppe, than to lyue lyke a pryuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon among vs. From thys maner of ſuſpicion, that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhalbe quite, that a long ſeaſon hath expreſſed ſpeciall tokens of true godlynes and ſobrenes in hym ſelfe. I wyll not heare thys obieccion, yf a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> woulde ſaye: what matter ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it to me, thoughe the Ethnikes doo myſreporte me? it is ynough for me, to be well taken among myne owne.

                     <p>Theſe thynges write I vnto the, derely beloued ſon, not as though I thought I ſhould not come vnto you agayne, but my truſt is that I ſhal ſhortely come agayne to ſee youre congregacion. Neuertheles in caſe any thing chaunce that I be enforced to be longer ere I come, than I truſt I ſhall, myne entente was to admonyſhe thee in the meane ſeaſon by my letters, that thou ſhouldeſt not be ignoraunt, howe to behaue thy ſelfe, not in the Iewes temple, but in the houſe of God. For why ſhoulde not I thus call the Chriſtian congregation which is conſecrated and dedicared vnto the lyuyng God, and ſhal neuer be deſtroyed with any ſtormes of errours and perſecutions, inaſmuche as it is the pyller and ſure poſt of the trueth. The temple of Ieruſalem had in tymes paſt his maner of veneration, it had his prieſtes, it had his rites and ſacrifices. But this is a temple much more holy than it, that keapeth not miſteries in couerte with ſhadowes and figures: but for the Cherubin, for the Pome granates, for the Belles, for the Arke, and for ſuche like fygures, it ſheweth vs playnlye the whole ſumme and perfite trueth of the goſpel. Therfore maruayle not, though thou heareſt nothyng preſcribed herein, what maner thynges Moyſes appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with greate diligence vnto the leuites and prieſtes. For there is no cauſe why we ſhould paſſe vpon thoſe ſhadowes, in aſmuche as God hath made the thynge playnely open vnto vs, for whoſe ſake all that miſticall furniture was ordayned for a tyme. And there is no cauſe why the Iewes ſhould haue in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration or bragge of the Arke or of anye thynge that had the mooſte holye thinges called <hi>ſancta ſanctorum</hi> locked in it, if they be compared with the miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that we haue. And whether their hydde ſecretes deſerue any ſpeciall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togatyue of worſhyp, or not, leat them ſee them ſelues. Certes this miſterie of the ghoſpelles godlynes, is out of all controuerſie, whiche maketh vs once free from all maner of ſuperſticion: and in this temple is the greateſt thyng of all other that is openly declared through the whole vniuerſall worlde. In dede there is no ſhewynge of the table or of the Arke or of ſacrificed beaſtes, but Chriſte himſelfe is ſhewed and preached, whiche beynge before tyme vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen and not paſſed vpon, is now become ſo manyfeſtly open, that he is playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye ſeen to be a man after the fleſhe, and handled of men, and after the ſpirite hath receyued ſo great power, that hauing done awaye the ſynnes of all men, hathe throughe onely faythe geuen and doeth geue the righteouſnes, that the lawe was not hable to geue. And this miſterie of ours is ſo openly manifeſted, that it was wonderfull euen in the eies of Aungelles, that ſong glory to God on highe, and peace vpon earth, and vnto men a good wyll. All other myſteries ceaſſe to be of any worſhyppe yf they be publyſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as for thys myſterye it is preached openly not onelye to the Iewes but alſo to the Gentyles.</p>

Finally after his death vpon the croſſe, he roſe agayne to lyfe by his owne power, and beyng openly accompanyed with Angelles he aſcended into the heauens, and ſhewed vs vndoubtedly whether all oure hope oughte to be addreſſed. What is more holy than thys myſterie? What is more excellente? what is more certayne or euident? This thyng yf we truely beleue, this thinge yf we worthyly lyue, for what purpoſe ſhould we reſpecte from henceforth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Iewyſhe conſtitucions?

To be briefe, whether ſhe haue left no good dede vndone for lacke of her dilygence. For it is reaſon that the congregacion ſhoulde receyue into their kepynge a woman that hathe ſo deſerued, whiche afore tyme hathe with her well doynges thus gon about, that ſhe myght be allowed perpetuallye to be a myniſtre vnto the congregacion.

of infamye, bycauſe they haue made fruſtrate the faythe that they ſeme to coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt vnto Chriſt, and ſo they are to blame twoo maner of wayes: bothe in that they toke the profeſſion of chaſtitie vnaduiſedlye, not hauynge ſufficientlye tryed their ſtrenghtes, and in that they lept backe from it whan they had taken it. And albeit it fortune not them openly to marye againe, yet verilye they lyue ſyngle after ſuche ſorte that they are a ſlaunder to the congregacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And better it were for them to be holden vnder at the commaundement of a huſbande, and to be occupyed in charge of houſeholde, than vnder pretence of wydowhead to ſinne more licenciouſlye.

Now they are not onely ydle, but alſo babling tale tellers &amp; curious herkeners. For bablynge &amp; curioſytie are accuſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>med to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany together.

For theſe cauſes ſake, I holde it ſurely better, that the yonger wydowes be rather maried to huſbandes, by autoritie wherof bothe the weaker ſexe &amp; the weaker age maye be gouerned, and that they applye them ſelues to bryng forthe children, and take charge of houſeholde rather tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in doyng nothing encombre other mennes houſeholdes. For euen as to ſtande in awe to the huſbande reſtrayneth the licenciouſnes of the ſexe and the age, euen ſo the charges of houſeholde geue them not free lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to meddle of thoſe thinges that they haue naught to doe withall. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude let them ordre their conuerſacion by all meanes ſo, as there be none occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of fallyng into manyfeſt reproche, and ſo as none occaſion be geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to bewraye and ſlaunder our lyfe by, vnto the enemyes of Chriſtes profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I ſay not naye, but I might ſeme to caſte ouer muche doubte in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, but that the myſchiefe it ſelfe teacheth vs thus to beware. For we would not be ſo narowlye afrayed, leſt any ſuche thing ſhoulde chaunce, excepte we had al readye ſene them chaunce oftener than once. The examples of ſome wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men fraye vs, who, whan they are once choſen into the ſuccoure of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacion, are ouercommen with luſtes, and ſeruynge Satan are ſlypped backe and maried againe. And albeit lacke of ioynter be the lette, that a wydowe (whoſe age requireth to be maried) can not fynde an huſbande, it nedeth not at all, that for pouerties ſake, ſhe ſhould take the profeſſion of chaſtitie.

They are monyſhed of their othe, whan they ſhall ſytte on gementes, and are afrayed with the religion of falſe goddes: But I charge the Tymothie by God the father (who beyng witneſſe and autour, this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is practiſed) and by Ieſus Chriſte, whoſe miniſtres we are, and by the electe angelles arbitrours and lokers on of thoſe thinges that we goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute, that in practiſynge of iudgementes thou obſerue thoſe thinges that I preſcribe vnto the, ſo as thou maieſt come to the hearing of cauſes vpryght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye and vncorruptelye, not bryngynge the ſentence with the, that fauoure or malyce or dyſpleaſure or any other affeccion hath ſecretlye ſowked into thee, but of the thing ſelfe in dede knowen, takynge matter to geue right ſentence of, declynynge nether to this parte nor that parte.

Therfore laye not handes vpon any man without delyberate aduiſement. It ſtandeth the in hande to trye and ſearche that man muche and long, whome thou muſte committe thautoritie of a byſſhop vnto, who yf he vſe the honour committed to hun otherwyſe than he ought to doe, it ſhalbe imputed vnto thee, whatſoeuer he doeth amyſſe.

It is not ynoughe alſo for a byſhop to ſet forthe his owne innocencie, but his duetie is alſo to make good the integritie of them whome he ordeyneth. In theſe thinges therfore ſee thou kepe thy ſelfe chaſte and pure vnto the Religion, wherof thou haſt charge. Thy temperate diet is more notably perceaued vnto me, than I nede to warne the from delicatenes. Howbeit this thou arte to be warned of, that abſtinence ought ſo to be meſured, as the feblenes of the bodye be not ſuche, that it be not hable to goe aboute the offices of godlynes. Lyke as a fatte and vnreaſonable luſtye bodye dothe many tymes holde downe the ſoule from myndynge heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For bothe the lyfe and doctrine of ſuche men dyffereth manifeſtlye from the doctrine of Chriſte. For in ſteade of goſpellyke godlynes they teache Iewyſhe ſuperſticion, and as for their lyfe, it is infecte with ambicion, haſtyng hande makyng, and other myſcheuous deſyres. As for theſe maner of men, lyke as thou mayeſt lawfully iudge of them, ſo muſt thou rendre accompte of them.

Therefore I ſuffre all thynges, for the electes ſakes, that they myght alſo obtayne that ſaluacion, which is in Chriſt Ieſu, with eternal glory. It is a true ſayinge, for yf we be dead with hym, we ſhall alſo lyue with hym. If we be pacient we ſhall alſo reigne with him. If we d eny hym, be al ſo ſhal denye vs. If we beleue not, yet abyderh he faythful. He cannot denye himſelf. Of theſe thinges put them in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce: and teſtifye before the Lorde, that they folowe no contencious wordes, whiche are to no profite: but to the peruerting of the hearers.</q>
                     <p>It is requiſite to haue in remembraunce, as thou knoweſt, that Chriſte Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus beyng made mortall man of the ſede of Dauid, hath enhaunced the glorye of the ghoſpell throughe ſuffrynge of rebukes, and after the puniſhemente of the croſſe was exalted to the rewarde of immortalitie. This is the ghoſpell, that I preache yet hitherto without ſhrynkynge, beyng neyther afrayed of the Iewes malice nor of the Gentyles feare. And for the ghoſpelles ſake I am afflicted with many diſpleaſures of them both yea euen vnto pryſon and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des as thoughe I were an euyll dooer.

And beyng a pryſoner, as muche as doeth poſſyblie lye in me, I allure as many as I can vnto Chriſt of what ſorte ſo euer they be. It maketh no matier to me what I ſuffre, ſo that I maye encreaſe ſome gaynes to the ghoſpell of Chriſt. For this cauſe ſake, I ſuffre all thynges wyllynglye, beyng aſſured of mine owne ſaluacion, and that they alſo throughe preachynge of the ghoſpell ſhall atteyne ſaluation, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God hathe appoynted to this felicitie, whiche ſaluation is offered to all men, not throughe Moſes lawe, but throughe Ieſus Chriſte, who lyke as he hathe ſuffred for vs, ſo lykewiſe it becometh vs to ſuffre for his goſpelles ſake and for the ſaluacion of our brethren: and lyke as he throughe ſondry afflictions and ſpyghtefull entreatyng was exalted to the glorye of heauen, euen ſo muſte we preace to the ſame ende by the ſame waye. This matier vnto manye ſemeth hard &amp; vncredible, but vnto vs it ought to be vndoubted. For yf we bethrough baptiſme dead together with Chriſt vnto the luſtes of this world: or alſo yf we perſeuer in the profeſſyon of baptiſme, &amp; ſo it chaunce vs to be turmoyled with the ſorowes of this world, it ſhal come to paſſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſhal alſo liue w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is to wete, we ſhall be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions of immortalitie w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him, whiche were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panyons of death with him: And yf we ſuffer wyth hym and for his glorie, we ſhall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly reigne w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him alſo. For god is of moſt perfite equitie, &amp; wil not ſuffre thoſe to be ſhut out from the felowſhippe of reygnyng, whom he would haue to be felowes of ſorowes ſuffryng. Yf we profeſſe him boldely in this worlde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, he ſhall acknowlege vs alſo in his Maieſtie. But and if we ſhall denye him (for he denyeth him that refuſeth his croſſe) it ſhall come to paſſe, that in the laſte daye we ſhall heare that terrible voice: I knowe you not. It we put our truſt in him, we do for our owne wealthe, but if we diſtruſt him, he ſhall haue no loſſe. For concernyng our opinion of him, there commeth neyther wynnyng nor loſyng to him therof. He of his owne nature is true, and can not choſe but be lyke hymſelfe. Whether we beleue or beleue not, that ſhall come to paſſe that he hath promyſed, to the godly, lyfe that neuer ſhal dye: and to the vngodlye, deathe that ſhall neuer haue ende. Thys is the foundacion of the ghoſpelles doetrine. Of this ſee thou warne all men, wythoute diſputyng and

But nowe after that it is made open thorow the ghoſpell, howe greate the goodnes and charite of God the father (which is autor of our ſaluation) is to al men, now after that the darkenes of our former lyfe is put away, we haue obteyned true lyfe &amp; ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: not by the obſeruation of the lawe, which had a certayne righteouſnes in it, but yet of ſmall efficacie to geue euerlaſtyng lyfe, but we haue obteined it thorowe the mere mercie of the Godhed. For by the holy fonte of baptiſme, we benewe borne agayne and graffed into Chriſt the ſonne of the euerlaſtyng fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and beyng renewed by his ſpirite, we haue ceaſed to be carnall and haue begon to be ſpirituall.

And he hath ſhed this his holye ſpirite into vs by Ieſus Chriſt, by whom it hath pleaſed him moſt liberally to geue vs all thynges, that we beyng purged by hys benefite from oure olde ſynnes, ſhould endeuour our ſelfes by good workes to be made apte to receiue the inheritaunce of the lyfe that endureth for euer, of the whiche the doctrine of the goſpell doeth put vs in a ſure hope.

Inſomuche that there were ſome euen amonge them that had receyued Chriſtes doctrine, which thought that the obſeruacon of the lawe ought in any wyſe to be ioyned and coupled with the goſpell. Wherfore the faythfull at Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, were ſondrie wayes vexed and iniured by ſuch as reſiſted the goſpel. For the aduerſaries beeing commen officers, and hauing the publike au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie in their handes, the ſincere profeſſours of the goſpel were caſte in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to priſon, were ſcourged, and ſuffred ſpoyle and loſſe of theyr goodes.

But chefely he conforteth them with the example of Chriſte, and hope of the heauenly reward. After this he declareth that now that Chriſtes goſpell hath ſhewed furth hir ſhyning lyght, the ſhadowes of Moſes lawe haue vaniſhed awaie, and continue no longer. And in this place he repeteth many thynges out of the olde teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and applieth them, vnto Chriſt. He teacheth further, that we ought not to hope for ſaluacion by kepyng of the lawe, which was geuen but for a tyme, &amp; was vnperfit, but by fayth, by which thoſe olde nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble holy men, whoſe reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braunce the Iewes had in great veneracion, chiefely pleaſed God.

And verelye thoſe children of Leui, whiche receyue thoffice of the prieſtes, haue a commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement to take (according to the lawe) tithes of the people, that is to ſaye, of theyr brethren, yea thoughe they ſprong out of the loynes of Abraham. But he whoſe kinred is not counted among them, receiued tithes of Abraham, and bleſſed him that had the promiſes. And no man denyeth, but that he whiche is leſſe receyueth bleſſyng of hym whiche is greater. And here men that dye, receiue tithes. But there he receiueth tithes, of whom it is witneſſed, that he liueth. And to ſay the trueth, Leuy himſelfe alſo, which vſeth to receiue tithes, payed tithes in Abraham. For he was yet in the loynes of hys father, when Melchiſedech mette Abraham.</q>
                     <p>And the lawe of Moyſes commaunded this, that they whiche came of the linage of Leui, ſhoulde ſuccede in the miniſtracion of prieſthoode, and receiue tithes, but of theyr brethren alonely, that is to ſaye, of the poſteritie of Abraham: neither doeth the auctoritie and dignitie of the Leuites ſtretch any further: but Melchiſedech where he was an alyaunt from the Iewiſhe nacion, receyued tithes of Abraham, the very auctour of the whole nacion and bleſſed him, of whome according vnto Gods promiſe, the nacion of the Iewes ſhoulde iſſue. It is out of contouerſie that the leſſe receiueth bleſſing of the greater. For whoſe bleſſeth, doeth as it were, allowe by hys autoritie that whiche is done. Nowe thauctoritie to allowe is wont to remayne in the ſuperiour, and not in him that is eguall or inferioure. And in the tribe of Leui they receiued tithes, who were alſo mortall menne themſelues, and by whoſe death theſame auctoritie came vnto other. But it is ſayde of Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech that he liueth and continueth for euer in the preeminence of perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all prieſthood. To conclude, whereas thauctoritie to demaund tithes came from leuy the chiefe prieſt vnto other prieſtes, yet in that that Abraham pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tythes to Melchiſedech, it ſemeth that Leuye alſo hymſelfe was made bonde to paye tythes, notwythſtandyng that he was wonte to receyue the ſame of other. Therefore as they are counted of leſſe authoritie that paye tythes vnto Leuy: ſo was Leuy inferioure vnto Melchiſedech vnto whome he gaue tythes. Some man wyll here ſaye: howe gaue he tythes who was not yet borne at what tyme Melchiſedech mette Abraham?

Our hye prieſt, who had no ſinne of his owne, toke vnto him the ſinnes of the whole worlde, and once offered vp a ſacrifice for all menne, not a beaſt, but hys owne proper perſone.

Affliction teacheth godlyneſſe, godlines bryngeth the ioyes of a good mynd or cleare conſcience, a good mind bryngeth forth immortalitie. Therfore lette no mannes harte fayle him in this moſt godly raaſe. The ſweate and labour is greate, but the rewardes are hygh and excellente, but the rewarde gyuer is faythfull.</p>

Alſo that ſeruauntes denye not their duetie to their maiſters, though they be heathens. For the office of chriſtian goodnes is, to ſuffre al thynges. Furthermore he admoniſheth the chriſtian women that they contemne not their huſbandes though they be heathens, but ſtudy by their owne maners to prouoke them vnto better. He warneth the huſbandes to beare with their wyues, and to abſteyne ſomtymes from hauing to do with them, ſo as they may the more apply them ſelues to praier. Than he prouoketh men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the example of Chriſt, to ſuffre diſpleaſures, and not to ymagine howe to requyte wronge with wronge, but to deuiſe howe to ouercome their euyll doers with ſoftenes and well doynges. And theſe matters he treateth of in the thre firſt Chaptres and in the beginning of the fourth. After theſe he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth men vnto neweneſſe of life and diſſuadeth from the heathens vices. He allureth men vnto ſobreneſſe, vnto watching, to continual prayers, and aboue other vnto mutuall charytie vnto hoſpitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and to do good turnes one for an other. Agayne he enticeth men paciently to ſuffer perſecucions, layed vpon them for Chriſtes name ſake. Than he informeth biſhops, and in them the people vnder their charge. In the ende he reporteth that he wrote an other epiſtle vnto them by Siluanus, which was loſte. This epiſtle it appeareth he wrote from Babilo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for in the name of that churhe he ſaluteth them, if any man allowe not the vnderſtanding of Rome by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</p>

For after ſuche wyſe doeth the wyſedom of God in prouiding for your commodities permitte, that the ſinceritie and ſtedfaſtnes of your faith may be tried through ſondry aſſaultes of ſorowes.

For what is a more gloryous thyng, than to be prayſed of Chriſtes owne mouthe? whan you ſhall heare: <hi>Come you bleſſed of my father:</hi> what thyng is more honorable than to be receaued of God the father into the felowſhippe of the kyngdome of heauen together with the ſonne? But thys glory, although it ſhall be the comen glory of all godly folkes, yet it ſhall chaunce more haboundauntly vnto them, that haue ſuffered greater thynges vpon earth for Chriſtes ſake.

But nowe the ſpecial chiefe prayſe of good folkes conſiſteth in this point, that where you neuer ſawe Chriſt with your bodyly eies, yet with the eies of fayth you ſee him and loue him: and wher as the violence of ſorowes doeth openly &amp; preſently grate vpon you, but the rewardes, which are kept till a daye, doe not nowe appeare, yet puttyng aſſured confidence in hys promiſſes, you ſuffre theſe thynges with none other ſtomacke, than yf the glory were preſently furnyſhed before your iyes, neither doe you ſuffre only with boldeneſſe, but alſo in the mydle of affliccions you reioyce with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable ioy, beyng ful of glory before God, that is to ſay, of a well hoping conſcience, and full of a certayne vnfeyned confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that where you ſuffre ſuche thynges vndeſeruedly, you ſhall, by the will of God, haboundauntly receyue a great fruyte of your fayth, that is to wete, the eternall ſaluacion of your ſoules.

Theſe mattersinaſmuch as they were done by the vnſpeakable counſaill of God, it is no maruell though the prophetes deſired to ſee them, ſeyng it is ſo excellently pleaſant and acceptable a ſight euen to the angels them ſelues to loke vpon, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the beholding wher of they cannot be fulfilled.

For it is conuenient that you diffre from them in affectes and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, from whom you diſſent in profeſſion.

For al fleſh is graſſe, and all the glory of man is as the floure of graſſe. The graſſe wyddereth, and the floure falleth awaye, but the worde of the Lorde endureth euer. And this is the worde, which by the goſpel was preached vnto you.</q>
                     <p>Therfore it remayneth that you which are deſirous to haue this father mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull vnto you, haue his vnauoydable iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t alwayes before your eies, while you liue in this exile, &amp; ſo order your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that there be nothing wherfore the father may be offended, &amp; iuſtly ſhut you out of the inheritau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the celeſtial countrey, as vnnaturall &amp; diſobedyent children. The greater the price is, wherwith Chriſte hath frely redemed you, ſo muche the greater hede ought you to take, leſt for your wilfulnes and vnthankefulnes, you be turned agayn into your former bonde thraldom.

For you are not made cleane with the bloud of a calfe ſprinkled, but with the precious bloud of Ieſus Chriſte who like a la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be cleane without any ſpotte, pure and vndefiled from all filthineſſe of ſynne, was offred for our ſynnes on the aultare of the croſſe. Nether yet was that done by chaunce at all auentures, but the ſonne of God was appointed to make this ſacrifice from euerlaſtyng and before the makyng of the worlde, that he might through his deathe reconcile the father vnto vs: howbeit the ſecret deuice and decre of Goddes purpoſed mynde, which was many long yeares vnknowen to the worlde, is now at length in theſe later times open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſted, and a new matter is ſet forth before mennes eyes to loke vpon whiche in the purpoſed mynde of God was not new. And it was geuen for your ſaluacion ſake, vnto whom Chriſte that was made man, dyed, and is preached, beſtoweth thus muche, that wher as you had a vayne truſte vpon the ceremonies of the lawe, now diſtruſting your ſelues, you muſt put your whole truſt in God the father: who like as he would haue Chriſte to dye to wype awaye your ſynnes, euen ſo hathe he rayſed him vp from death, and for the paynfull trauailes of this life which he ſuffred, he gaue him the glory of immortalitie: to thentente that as you haue beleued that whiche he hath done, in folowing his example, you might alſo truſt ſurely to haue the ſame reward to be beſtowed on you, in that you put your whole affiau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in God, which what he hath already perfourmed in his ſonne, the ſame alſo will he vndoubtedly performe in al them, which lyue after ſuche ſort, that they may be worthyly accompted among the membres of Chriſt, in to whoſe body you are engraffed, ſynce that you were regenerate through baptiſme in to hym.

carnall ſhadowes of thinges in ſtede of true ryght thinges: but now ſince you haue clenſed your ſoules, not with the obſeruacion of Moſes purge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſacrifices, but in that you haue through faith obeyed the trueth of the goſpell, whiche by the ſpyryte of Chriſte hath purged your conſciences, you muſt endeuour your ſelues both to be correſpondente vnto the head Chriſte in vprightnes of life, and be anſwerably like vnto the concorde of the body by an excedyng and a playne brotherly and an vnfeyned loue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong your ſelues: that lyke as Chriſt loued you not after a commen ſort, nor after a carnall maner of loue, euen ſo ſhould you loue euery one other, with a ſpiritual loue.

For this is the will of the moſt hyghe God youre Prynce, that you geue none occaſion vnto their inconſiderate ignoraunce, whereby they myghte proueably call the goſpelles profeſſion to blame, if they perceaued you to ſet naught by their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie.

He demaundeth cuſtome, paye it him: he exacteth tribute, geue it him. That which thoſe that be free ought to do to the Magiſtrates, thoughe they be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, bonde ſeruauntes ought to do vnto their maiſters: from ſeruing of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> baptiſme maketh them not free.

To deſerue well of them that deſerue euill, and to ſpeake well of them that be euyll ſpeakers and backebytours, is thoffice of Chriſtian vertue. If any man thynke this an harde matter, let him heare the Pſalme wryttour enſpired with the ſpirite of God, that commaundeth the very ſame: whoſo is deſirous (ꝙ he) to loue lyfe, and to ſe good dayes, let him refrayne his tongue from euell: lette him reſtrayne his lyppes, that they ſpeake no deceate: let him eſchewe euel, and doe good: let him ſeke for peace, and folowe it: For the eies of the Lorde are vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ryghteous, and his eares are attentiue vnto their prayers.

                     <p>Who would couet to doe harme, yf you ſtudye to do good for all men, and to hurte no man? But yf there be anye found ſo vtterly blynd, that for malyce they beare to vertue or throughe ignoraunce do perſecute you, I praye you, in what thing can they hurt you?

For it is not ynoughe for Chriſtians, to ſpeake thinges that are true and worthy of Chriſt: but alſo to ſpeake after ſuche ſorte, that the verye reaſon of your talke maye declare, that you are not in hande with your own buſines, but that you reſpecte the glorie of Chriſte, and the ſaluation of them, whiche you ſpeake vnto.

For aſmuche as Chryſt hath once ſuffred for ſinnes, the iuſt for the vniuſt, to bring  vs vnto God, and was killed, as pertaining to the fleſhe: but was quickned in the ſpirit. In which ſpirit he alſo went and preached vnto the ſpirites that were in priſon, whych ſomtyme had ben diſobedient, when the long ſuffering of God was once loked for in the daies of Noe, while the Arke was a preparing: wherin a few, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is to ſay, viii. ſolles, were ſaued by the water, lyke as baptiſme alſo now ſaueth vs, not the puttynge away of the fylth of the fleſhe: but in that a good conſcience conſenteth to God, by the reſurreccion of Ieſus Chriſt, whyche is on the righte hande of God: and is gone into heauen, Aungelles, powers, and myght, ſubdued vnto hym.</q>

For it is better for you, if it be the wyll of God, that you ſuffre theſe thinges that you ſuffre, for wel doyng, than for euil doyng. For he that is punyſſhed for his euil dedes, ſuffreth that he hath deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: but the punyſhementes that you ſuffre, turne to the glory of Chriſte, and to the heaped encreace of your felicitie.

It is Chriſt than that hath made vs cleane, being delyuered to death for the weakenes of the humaine body which he had receiued, but he was raiſed to life agayne by the power of the ſpirite, whyche coulde not be ouercome wyth any affliccions.

might encreace by occaſion vnto euery one the rewarde of godlynes. Let no man be diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent with him ſelfe, in that he is not endued with this or that gift. Let no man alſo ſtonde in his owne conceit, in that he hath mo qualities geuen vnto him than other haue.

And yf he do that faithfully, chearefully and deſirouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, lette hym not loke for rewarde of man, inaſmuche as he ſhall receaue it of God.

And that ſhall be done, to the intent that of giftes diuerſly diſtributed, and of offices diuerſly gone about, God may be glorified on euery parte, of whom as of the welſpring we haue al thynges flowynge vnto vs, not by Moſes, but by Ieſus Chryſte, by whom whatſoeuer the father geueth, he geueth it vnto vs, as his only ſonne.

It is his buſynes that you take in hande, and of him you ſhall receyue euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinge rewarde. Loke not for rewarde in this lyfe. It is a ſhame, to take charge of chriſtian people for vauntage ſake: whiche charge no man is prayſed for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge, but he that dooeth it of his owne accorde and frely without any thinge. That man is fallen out of the rewarde of heauen, that hunteth after the hyre of his office at mennes handes here in this worlde. Next vnto this it is, yf any man, thoughe he ſet naught by lucre, yet ſeketh ambiciouſly after honour and dignitie, being deſyrous to be a commaunder, beyng deſirous to be reuerenced: that man ſhall haue no rewarde alſo with God. He hath receaued his rewarde: The office of a right byſſhop is ferre of from lordinge. It is not a tirannye, but an adminiſtracion. A biſſhop is put in autoritie for this ende, not to ſcrape to him ſelfe the more gayne therby, not to reigne a lofte, and to vſe his pleaſure the more frely, but to doe the more good. Therfore you elders, reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre your office, behaue your ſelues ſo in all thinges, that your lyfe maye be an example vnto the people of a goſpellyke conuerſacion. Let them learne of your behauiour to ſet naught by lucre, let them learne to defye dyſdeignous ſtatelynes, let them learne to hope for the hyre of their duties dooing at Chriſtes handes, &amp; to haue reſpecte to none other thing in this worlde, but becauſe ſo it is honeſt, ſo is it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God. In the meane ſeaſon playe the good ſhepherdes frely without any thing. Neuertheles in dede it ſhall not be doen for nothing: but whan the prince of ſhepherdes Ieſus Chriſt ſhall in thappointed daye openly ſhew forth him ſelfe, whiche gaue him ſelfe wholy for his ſhepe, the keping wherof he hath committed vnto your credence, than in ſtede of a vyle &amp; mortal triflyng rewarde you ſhall receyue the glorious crowne of your duetye doinge, whiche ſhal neuer fade. Therfore in no wyſe take the thing vpon your ſelues, that you ought to loke for at your princes handes: preuent not the daye, whiche he woulde haue to be vncertaine vnto vs. And like as it is the parte of ſuche as be Elders, to ſhew them ſelues as fathers vnto the yonger, euen ſo the yonger ought on the other parte to ſhewe them ſelues manerly and obedient vnto the elders: and lyke as the Elders ſubmitte them ſelues throughe goſpellyke charitie vnto all men, to thintent they maye doe the more good, euen ſo the yong ought not to abuſe the gentilnes and facilitie of the Elders, but it is rather co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient for them to obey them w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo muche the more ready diligence, as they abuſe the leſſe their autoritie. Where true charitie is, there autoritie is nether dyſdeinfull nor the youthe is outragiouſlye fearce. He y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is ſet in dignitie, goeth about nothinge but this, that he may doe good for other: and he y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is a ſubiecte, doeth more of his owne free ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde, than he requireth him. Let all men therfore haue gentyll ſobrenes fyxed vtterly in their hartes: and that ſhall be occaſion, that nether the Elders ſhalbe weary of their charge, nor y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> yonger greued at their autoritie. God hateth fearce flowtenes of ſtomake in men: his delyght is in lowe mynded heartes, and ſuche is deiecte them ſelues: he beſtoweth his giftes vnto them that take nothing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them ſelues: he repelleth &amp; forſaketh y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> proude perſons, as vnworthy his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites.

Geue not place vnto him, but reſiſte him with vnſhrinkinge ſtronge hartes. You wil ſay: where haue we power againſt him that is ſo mightie? He that hathe charge of you, is mightier than he. Put all the whole truſt of your hartes vpon him, and your aduerſaries power ſhalbe nothinge. Againſt the faithles, he is ſtrong: but againſt the faithfull he is feble. Yf he ſhoulde aſſaulte this man or that man, parchaunce it might rightly be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a ſore greuous affliccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but now doeth he impugne al the whole flocke of the godly w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> like malicious hatred.

This is my deare beloued ſonne, in whome I haue delyte. This voyce we hearde come from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when we were with him in the holy mount. We haue alſo a right ſure worde of prophecie, wherunto (yf ye take hede) as vnto a light that ſhyneth in a darcke place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ye do well vntil the daye dawne, and the day ſtarre aryſe in your heartes. So that ye firſt knowe this: that no prophecye in the ſcripture hath any priuace enterpretacion. For the ſcripture came neuer by the wyll of man: but holy men of God ſpeake, as they were moued by the holy ghoſt.</q>
                     <p>For our doctrine was not ſuche gayre, as the philoſophers teache, whoſe drifte is to perſwade by crafulye conueyed fables, and humayne ſubtilties, the thing that they them ſelues vnderſtande not, and dyſagree alſo amonge them ſelues. But we haue in no wyſe folowed theſe wayes, in openynge vnto you the power and comminge of our lorde Ieſu Chriſt, and in preachinge vnto you his maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, whiche we haue ſene with theſe iyes. For he vouchedſafe to exhibite vnto certaine of his owne afore his death ſome ſpecial token, with what mightie po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and with what glorye he ſhall once come, to iudge the quicke and the dead, and what wonderfull felicitie he ſhal geue vnto them, that loue him ſtedfaſtlye. For where God the father endued him all wholy with glorye and honour, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuche that his countenaunce ſhoone as bright as the ſunne, and his clothes were more white than the ſnowe, ſo farre, that mannes iyes coulde not abyde to beholde the heauenly ſyght, and there came alſo an exceadynge moſt honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble teſtimonie of the fathers voyce, whiche was brought downe from highe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him from the glorious maieſtie of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> father. And it was after this ſorte: This is my welbeloued ſonne, whiche hathe delyghted my mynde, heare him. There coulde haue ben no witneſſe geuen, eyther more fully or more excellent. And it was pronounced, not of any prophet, but of the fathers owne maieſtie. Theſe thinges we haue ſene with our iyes, theſe haue we hearde with our eares, whan we were preſent with him in the holy mount Thabor. If ſo be that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes playne oracles be in a great weightie eſtimacion among you, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied by figuratyue darke ſhadowes of Chriſt: of much more grauitie ought ſo euident a declaracion by the father himſelfe of his ſonne be. The prophetes agree with the fathers voice, yf a man doe rightly interprete them. They with their promiſſes prepare as it were mennes myndes to the trueth of his goſpell, in that they ſhadowe and as it were couertly poynt out, the thing that the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell doeth openly preache. Therfore I doe not diſallowe, that the Iewes beyng vehementlye geuen to the prophetes prophecienges, ſeke there for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge of Meſſias. For it is a ſteppe ſomewhat vnto the faythe of the goſpel, to beleue that Chriſt ſhoulde come. For a man ſhall the more ſoner beleue that Chriſte is come, yf he be parſwaded that he ſhoulde come. Therfore there is good hope of him, that beynge not yet lightened with the lyght of the Goſpell, is attentiue vnto the prophetes, as to a candell appearinge in a darcke place. For it is better to haue ſome lyght than no light, tyll the ſunne come, and the daye dawne, to dryue awaye all darkenes, and to obſcure euen that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell,
<pb facs="tcp:7459:304"/>
and that the daye ſterre of goſpell preachinge maye ſhyne bryght in your hartes, whiche declareth that the ſonne is at hande. The ſayinges of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes are to this vſe profytable, yf they that reade them, conſider that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of prophecyinge before hande is darkly hydden vnder couerte of figures, &amp; can not be vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>den without interpretacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is not euery mannes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretaccion, nor after euery mannes arbitrement. For the prophetes, whiche ſpake of thinges before hande, did not ſpeake after their owne braine nor after the deuyſe of their owne mynde, but where they were holy men and pure from al humaine luſtes, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> holy goſt inſpired their hartes, &amp; vſing them as his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, he ſignified his mynde vnto vs by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accordingly.

But y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> thing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> is ſet forthe by the inſpiracion of the holy goſt, requireth an interpretoure inſpired with the lyke ſpirite.

Nether are they eaſely perſwaded that Chriſt is come, in that by falſe interpretacion of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, they imagine to them ſelues a certaine earthlye Meſſias, ſuche a one as he ſhewed not him ſelfe to be.

For inaſmuche as theyr life is filthy, they ſhall not be deſyrous of the lordes commyng: And for that cauſe ſake ſhall they perſwade bothe to them ſelues and others, that he ſhal not come agayn, and ſaye: where is the promyſed reſurreccion? where is the iudgement? where are the ſondrye ſortes of rewardes according to the deſertes of lyuing? whan co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth he that is loked for day by day in vayne?

Our fathers are dead one after an other, and neuer one hathe riſen agayn to life yet hytherto.

Beloued, when I gaue all diligence to wryte vnto you of the commen ſaluacyon, it was nedefull for me to write vnto you, to exhorte you that ye ſhould continually laboure in the faith, whiche was once geuen vnto the ſaynetes.

They turne the grace of our God vnto wantonues, and deuye God (whiche is the onely Lorde) and oure Lorde Ieſus Chriſte. My mynde is therfore to put you in remembraunce, for as muche as ye once knowe thys, how that the Lorde (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he had deiyuered the people out of Egypte) deſtroyed them which afterward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued nor.

But theſe ſpeake euyll of thoſe thynges which they knowe not: and what thinges they knowe naturally (as beaſtes which are without reaſon) in thoſe thinges they corrupte them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues. Wo bee vnto them, for they haue folowed the waye of Cayn, and are vtterly geuen to the errour of Balam for lukers ſake, and periſſhe in the treaſon of Chore.

They are the ragynge waues of the ſea, fomynge out theyr owne ſhame. They are wandring ſtertes, to whome is reſerued the myſt of darckenes for euer. Enoch the ſeuenth from Adam prophecyed before of ſuche, ſaying: Beholde, the Lorde ſhall come with thouſandes of ſaynctes, to geue iudgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt all menne, and to rebuke all that are vngodly among them, of all theyr vngodly dedes, whiche they haue vngodly commytted, and of all their cruell ſpeakynges, whiche vngodly ſinners haue ſpoken agaynct hym.

But ye beloued, remembre the wordes whiche were ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before of the Apoſtles of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, howe that they tolde you that there ſhould be begylers in the laſte tyme, whiche ſhoulde walke after theyr vngodly luſtes.

But ye dearely beloued, editie your ſelues in your moſte holy faythe, prayinge in the holy ghoſte, and kepe your ſelues in the loue of God, lokynge for the mercy of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt vnto eternall lyfe. And haue compaſſion of ſome ſeperatyng them: and other ſaue with feare, pullyng them out of the fyre (and haue compaſſion on the other) and hare the fylthy veſture of the ſleſh.

But the right godly man prayeth thus: I am vnworthy of thy bounteous goodnes, I am worthy of wrathe, but yet for all that loke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy ſeruant, for thou by nature arte good and mercifull. Therfore if a man be mynded to obteyne of hym that he aſketh, let him aſke without deſtruſting, without doubt or wauering.

Of hys owne will begat he vs with the worde of trueth, that we ſhoulde be the fyrſte trutes of hys creatures. Wherfore (deare brethren) let euery man be ſwyfte to beare, ſlowe to ſpeake, ſlowe to wrath. For the wrathe of man worketh not that whiche is ryghteous before God. Wherfore, laye aparte al fylthynes &amp; ſuperfluytie of malicyouſnes, and receaue with mekenes, the worde that is graffed in you, which is able to ſaue youre ſoules.</q>
                     <p>Whether a man loue God purely, the pleaſures of this worlde dooe trye, but muche more doeth the hurly burly of affliccions. And it is in vs, that being furnyſhed with the helping ayde of God, we maye nether become tendre nyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynges through vayne pleaſures, ne moued with terrible turmoylinges. But if a manne be moued with the delices of the worlde from the right ſtate of mynde, or if a man be led by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſorow of affliccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s out of true godlines, he hath nothing to laie vnto Goddes charge. He y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> getteth the victorie, getteth the victory by the helpe of God: and he that is ouercomme, is ouercome through hys own faulte. For God doeth not geue menne occaſyon to ſynne, but the thynge that he ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth according to his own goodnes for the nouryſhment and encreace of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, our mindes being corrupte, and as it were cralled with affeccions, turneth to thoccaſyon of theyr owne deſtruccion. For God doeth ſomtymes geue vs the vſe of habundaunce of goodes, and the commodities of life, to the intent that being prouoked by his liberall goodnes we ſhould tendre thankes vnto him. Againe, he ſuffreth vs ſomtymes to bee afflicted with aduerſities, that he may both make our godlines more notably ſeene, &amp; encreace our rewarde. And if the matter turne to the cotrary parte, it is our faulte &amp; not his. For like as he being by nature good, can not bee prouoked w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any euilles, euen ſo doth he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice noman vnto euil. The thing is of vs, that turneth the goodnes of God vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to oure euil. He geueth pleintie of meates, he geueth the liquor of wyne, that beyng moderately refreſhed, we ſhoulde geue prayſes to the maker. And ſhall he that is dronken with wyne call God vnto the lawe? no in no wyſe:

let him accuſe his owne mynde, whoſe vicious gredynes entiſed and drewe him to dronkenes. Ther is a certayne readynes vnto vice graffed in oure hartes of our fyrſte parentes vice, and that is as it were a ſede of ſynne. And if it bee receaued in to the harte and receaue nouriſhment, than the mynde hathe as it were all ready conceaued ſynne. And onles the vicious deſire be dryuen out of mynde, the ſtynking ſmell of it groweth and waxeth ſtrong by litell and litell, till deadly ſynne be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted. Whiche, whan it is in his nombres conſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mately done, beginneth to bring forthe frute it ſelf agayne. And the frute that it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forthe is the naughtieſt frute of all, euen deathe euerlaſting: And this is the moſt heauy frute of that pleaſure that is delectable in outwarde appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and promyſing ſwete geare, I wote not what, while it hydeth vnder the bayte of pleaſure, the very angling hoke of death. Like therfore as thys lower worlde hath nothing pure and perfite in euery parte, but the good thinges are corrupt with the badde, and the thinges that are of gladnes are enterchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geably myngled with ſadneſſe, corrupcion enfecteth the ayer, diſeaſe and age decayeth the ſtrength of bodye, darkenes hyndreth the fauour of light: euen ſo in our myndes, as longe as they are entangled with theſe bodyes, there is ſcarcely any thynge in all partes bleſſed and pure, but it is corrupt with ſome ſpotte of humaine deſires or with the darkenes of errour and ignoraunce. But what ſo euer naughtynes is in vs, we ought to impute it vnto oure ſelues and not to God. For if we were of pure affeccions, if we put oure truſte with oure whole harte in God, if we breathed with all oure inwarde powers vnto the thinges that are euerlaſting and heauenly, what ſo euer ſhoulde bee layed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſte vs in this life, whether it were mery or ſory, it woulde turne to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creace of Godlynes. Therfore deare brethren, doe not you as the commune ſort of foliſh men doeth, who to thintent they may excuſe theyr ſynnes, pleade with the maker of nature at law, as though he were the autor of ſynne. Farre be this errour from you, whiche haue learned the Goſpells philoſophie. Like as God of his owne nature is purely and moſte chiefly good, euen ſo doeth there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing procede from him but that whiche is good. Yf any naughtynes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be in vs, let vs not aſcribe it vnto God but vnto oure owne ſelues: and yf any good thyng, yf any true lyght, yf any vndefyled wyſedome be in vs, let vs aſcribe it wholy vnto God the autor. Yf this groſſe worlde haue any lyght, it hathe it of the heauenly bodies, and eſpecially of the ſunne. What true knowlage ſo euer is in vs, what pure and ſyncere affeccion ſo euer be in vs, it ariſeth not of vs (for we are nothyng elles but ſynners and ignoraunt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones,) but it procedeth from aboue: what ſo euer is truly good, it commeth from the autor of all goodnes: what ſo euer lawfull and perfite thing there be, and ſuch thing as maketh you acceptable vnto God, it cometh from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne of all perfeccion: what ſo euer is truly light, the father and prince of all true light ſendeth it vnto vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him ſelf. Theſe thinges he beſtoweth not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oure deſertes, but he geueth them vnto vs frely, as he is liberall of nature. They are giftes rather than rewardes, it is a liberall larges rather than a hire. It is not right therfore that we chalenge any thing therof vnto vs, but for our naughtynes let vs call vpon the mercie of God: for goodnes bicauſe it is not ours, let vs geue thankes vnto his liberalitie. Like as he of his owne nature is the beſte, euen ſo he cannot geue but the thynges that are beſte: lyke as he is

This our daye is taken awaye of the night folowing, and caſte about with cloudes goyng betwene, humayne wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is darkened with errours of opinions, mans vprighteouſnes is infected with naughty deſires. With him there is no mixture of euylles, no courſes of darkenes. It behoueth vs therfore alſo to conforme our ſelues to the vttermoſt of our powers according to his ſimplicitie, that geuing our ſelues vnto godly ſtudyes, and being apte more and more to receyue his giftes, we maye be as it were tranſformed in to hym. For it is conuenient, that children reſemble the nature of their parent. We haue vnthirftyly reſembled Adam the prynce of this groſſe and corrupt birthe.

He was the true light pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding of the moſte high light, whoſe doctrine hathe made bright mens myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and ſet them free from the doctrine of this worlde. And the heauenly worde is of ſuche efficacie, that it doeth not onlye chaunge vs, but tranſformeth vs as it were vtterly in to other men, abhorryng now the thynges that we loued muche before, and loue that we before abhorred. And this is the honoure that the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father worthyed vs withal not prouoked by our merites, but of his own free goodnes, wherby he ſo determyned from euerlaſting, that he woulde, by ſuche meanes as hathe not ben hearde tell of, make a newe creature in the earthe, and woulde that we ſhoulde bee as it were the fyrſt frutes of thys newe eſtate, in that we are called amonge the fyrſte vnto the doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. Foraſmuche than as God hathe endued vs with thys honour frely, it remayneth, that we conforme oure ſelues lyke vnto hys hounteous goodnes to the vttermoſt of our power againe: we are frely admitted vnto this felicity, but we might fall from it agayne for all that through our owne fault, onles we ſtudie to kepe through godly forcaſtes, that which is frely geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It were of non effecte for vs to be choſen through baptiſme, and profeſſing of the Goſpelles doctrine in to the felowſhip of the ſonne of God, excepte we frame oure ſelues through chaſt and cleane maners like vnto our profeſſion. That like as euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtyng lighte hathe geuen vs light by the ſonne of God, ſo muſte all oure life beare witnes, that we belonge to the felowſhip of light. We once caſte of the olde manne with hys errours, with his affectes, with hys vices, now it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that we enſue the cleane contrary thynges. Heretofore you had rather ſeme maiſters than diſciples, for ſo ambicion perſwaded you, that the commune

people woulde recon him the better learned, that was moſte ful of bablyng: you had rather haue ben angrye with hym that counſailed you aright, than to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlage your faulte: you had rather haue folowed wicked outragious luſte, than enſue thoſe thinges that bring ſaluacion: Now my deare brethren, who ſo will be coumpted a new man, let him be ſlow to ſpeake, ſwyft to heare, and ready to learne of any manne. Howbeit let no manne raſhly nor ouer haſtyly take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to be a teacher. And like as he is not voyde of peril to fall, that is haſtye to ſpeake, euen ſo is that manne inclined to doe iniurie, whiche is lightly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in hys mynde. For it is requiſite that godly menne bee farre of, not only from all reuengement, but alſo from all euill ſpeaking. For he ſhalbe the more ſafe from chyding, that maketh no aunſwer: and he ſhal do no man wrong, that whan he is prouoked, is not angrye. Among men peraduenture he ſhall ſeme a iuſte man, that requiteth one euil worde with an other, one euell dede for an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but yet he ſhalbe a greate deale wyde from the iuſtice of God, who by hys ſonne hathe taught vs, to ſpeake well of them that backbyte vs, to wiſhe well to them that wiſhe euil to vs, to doe good for them that doe euil vnto vs. Theſe thinges he dooeth not, that letteth his tongue runne at large, whiche is a warb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling membre and a ſlyppery, nor he that hathe wrathe ſecretly. Theſe maner of luſtes, like as they ouerthrowe and cheoke the ſede of Goddes woorde, that whan it commeth vp it bring forthe no frute in you, euen ſo doe they lette that it canne not bee ſowen in to the fielde of the mynde. It taketh no rote in a bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery place, ne in marice, nether in the ſande that fleeteth awaye, but it requireth a pure, a trymme and a ſubſtaunciall grounde. Therfore if ye will, that the ſede of the worde of the Goſpell, that is once caſt; bring frute in you, frute (I ſay) not for a ſeaſon, or a commune frute wherwith the bodyes may be refreſhed, but the eternall ſaluacion of your ſoules: make cleane the fielde of your harte not onely from the tumulte of euil ſpeaking and of wrathe, but alſo from al gredy luſtes, wherwith mans mynde is defiled: from the thornes of coueteouſnes from the grauell of raſhenes, from the ſlyme of outragious luſt, from the ſtones of pride and wilfulnes. For in dede the mynde that is burthened with thys geare, is not hable to receaue the worde of the Goſpell, which knocketh in vayne at the tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pane of the eares, onles it light depe in to the inwarde partes of the harte. And if it once ſettle in to your myndes, it ſhall not bee baren, but ſhote forthe and ſhewe it ſelfe with godly workes.</p>

                     <q>¶ And ſe that ye be doars of the worde and not hearers onely, deceauing your owne ſelues. For yf any man heare the worde, and declareth not the ſame by hys workes, he is  like vnto a man beholdynge hys bodely face in a glaſſe. For aſſone as he hath toked on him ſelfe, he goeth his waye, and forgetteth immediatly what hys faſſhyon was. But who ſo loked in the parfayr lawe of libertie, and continueth therin (yf he be nor a forgetfull hearer, but a doar of the worke) the ſame ſhalbe happy in hys dede. If any in an amonge you ſeme to be deuout and refrayneth not hys tongue, but deceaueth his owne herte, this mannes deuocion is in vayne. Pure deuocio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and vndefiled before God the father, is this: to viſite the fatherles and widoowes in theyr aduerſytie, and to kepe hym ſelfe vnſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the worlde.</q>
                     <p>The Iewes haue their lawe by harte without boke, and yet they expreſſe it not in their life. The philoſophers do learne perfitely the leſſons howe to lyue wel, &amp; thinke that to bee ynough, farre deceauyng them ſelues: where as the felicitie of manne is not in the ſpeaking but in the lyuing. But vnto you it ought not to be ynough, that being newely inſtructed, you haue heard the Goſpelles doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine:
<pb facs="tcp:7459:315"/>
that being baptiſed, you are admitted vnto the harder hidden miſteries of the Goſpelles doctrine: that you haue learned ouer and ouer all the whole phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie of Chriſte and all hys life: ne that you haue receaued the promyſſe of Immortall life. That whiche Chriſte taught, muſte bee expreſſed in outwarde maners: That whiche he did, muſte bee folowed of vs to the vttermoſte of oure poſſible powers. It behoueth vs to dye vnto the deſires of this worlde, and be buried with hym, to riſe agayne with hym vnto Innocencye, to bee caryed with him in to heauen: and finally we ought ſo to lyue vpon earthe, as we appeare not vnworthie the rewardes of heauen.</p>
                     <p>Will you heare, howe that he yeldeth no frute at all, whiche heareth the worde of the Goſpell, but lightly and vnconfiderately? He is moſte like vnto a man that beholdeth hys face in a glaſſe. He beholdeth, but he doeth nothing els but beholde only. For he can not chaunge his naturall face, nether goeth he any other maner away from the glaſſe than he came to it. Yea inaſmuch as he went only for this purpoſe, to ſee what fauour his face was of, he thinketh not of the amending of the faultes of hys fauour, but as ſone as he goeth awaye from the glaſſe, he remembreth nothing whiche a one he ſawe him ſelfe to be. But the glaſſe of the Goſpelles doctrine ſheweth not the blemyſhes and outbreakinges of the body, but it layeth all the diſeaſes of thy ſoule before thyne eies: nether doeth it only ſhewe them, but alſo healethe them. Moſes lawe did rather vtter the ſores of the ſoule than healed them. For the lawe, as concernyng the lettre, was imperfecte, and frayed menne from euyll by feare, rather than cauſed menne willingly to folowe the thynges that were good. But the lawe of the Goſpell, obteyneth more of the wyllyng, and thoſe that bee at lybertie through loue, than the lawe of Moſes gat perforce. And the lawe of the Goſpell maketh perfite that it begynneth, where the other bryngeth nothyng to perfectyon. Whoſoeuer therfore will diligently behold bothe his mynde and his life at this glaſſe (and that ſhould he doe continually) neuer mouing his eies from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and doctrine of Chriſte, that is to ſay, whoſoeuer heareth the holy word, not after ſuche light ſorte, that turnyng him ſelf backe by and by to the cares of this worlde he ſeme to forget that he hearde, but frameth all hys life after the rule of it, expreſſing by godly workes, that which he ſticked faſt in the marye of the ſoule, he ſhall ſurely be bleſſed: not becauſe he heard the worde, but becauſe he did after it in his affeccions and maners. Thou heareſt Chriſt ſaye, that the tormente of hell fyre abydeth for him, that ſayeth vnto his brother: thou foole. And yet forgetting by and by what thou heardeſt, thou arte ready for a lyght checking worde to fight with him. Thou heareſt, that thoſe riches are to be ſet naught by, whiche are in daunger of mothes and theues, and that true riches ought to be layed vp in ſtoare in heauen: but as ſone as thy backe is turned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the preacher, thou ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neſt on with al thy forcaſting ſtudies, to muckre vp ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, (thou careſt not how) by hoke or by croke, as though thou beleuedeſt, that godlynes ſhould not be rewarded after this life. And if any among you thinke him ſelfe wonderous deuout, if he kepe hys handes from ſtealynge, and from fighting and other vyces, and yet for all that refrayne not hys tongue from backbyting, myſreportes, from ſcoldinges, from filthie talkinges, nether his harte from vncleane thinkinges: hys deuocion is vnprofitable &amp; vnfrutefull. Perchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he is not puniſhed by mans lawes, that only talketh of whoredome though he doe it not, yet he is become an whoremonger before God, that in his

We are eſtemed after y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> manifeſt dedes before menne, for they ſee not the mynde. But God loketh vpon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde affeccions of the mynde, and eſtemeth vs after them. A corrupt mynde is vſed for the moſte parte to hurſt out in to the tongue. Among Chriſten peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a reuiling woorde is a kynde of manſlaughter, but this is playne, that true godlynes can in no wiſe agree with racklenes of tongue. Nether yet is it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience vnto Chriſtian religion, to haue abſteyned from ſynnyng: it behoueth alſo to abounde in good workes. For in dede bonde ſeruauntes abſteyne from doing euill, yea, for feare of punyſhment, but thoſe that are right children, it becometh to haue loue, whiche is no idle loytring matter, but effectually wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and putteth forthe it ſelfe frely without compulſion to dooe euery good worke. But ſome woulde ſaye, what dedes than are thoſe that make vs ryght religious in dede? Thoſe that ſmell of the Iewes ſecte ſet furthe the prayſe of religion, in Palles and wyde robes, in choiſe of meates, in waſhinges, in longe prayers, and other ceremomes, which are ſometymes not altogether to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, if by them as by ſignes we be warned of thoſe thinges, whiche are the propre own matters of godlines: but thei are pernicious ware, yf a man thinke that he is made religious by meane of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> where as of them ſelues without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſicion, they make a man rather an hipocrite. Howbeit the obſeruing of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a religious deuoute matter among men, that wickedly repoſe godlines in viſible thinges: whiche perchaunce are ſignes of godlynes, but not the cauſe of godlynes, ſeing that of them ſelues they are nether good nor euill, onles they ſeme to be ſuche, either through cuſtome or in the opinion of menne, where as true godlynes is in the inwarde myndes, and expreſſeth it ſelfe by farre more certaine ſure ſignes than by ceremonies. Will you therfore heare, what is true religion with God the father, whiche eſtemeth you not after the iudgement of manne? Doubtles, thys is the pure and vndefyled religyon: that like as we haue by experience proued bothe the mercie and liberall goodnes of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes vs, euen ſo muſte we agayne bee bothe mercyfull and frendely liberall towardes our neighbour, and that not vpon any hope of mutuall good turne to be requited to vs agayne, but of a mere and a pure vpright loue, loking for the rewarde of our wel doing at the handes of none other but of God, whiche is contente to haue it reconed to bee done to him ſelfe, what ſo euer we beſtowe for his ſake vpon our brother.</p>
                     <p>He is a godly and a pure man among the Iewes, that toucheth not caryon, that is waſhed with quycke rennyng water: but with God he is godly and pure, that ſuccoureth the fatherles children and wydowes in theyr trouble, that releueth hys oppreſte brother, and helpeth the nedye with money. Among the Iewes he is vncleane, that eateth ſwynes fleſhe: But with God he is vncleane, whoſe mynde is infected and defieled with the gredye luſtes of thys worlde. But a manne will ſaye, what be thoſe luſtes? In the iudgement of the worlde, he is counted vile that is poore: And he the more honeſtlie ſet by, that hathe moſte poſſeſſion of riches, and for that cauſe theyr ſpeciall carke and care is to get to them ſelues the moſte ſubſtaunce of money. He is reconed a lowete and a henneharted raſcall, that maketh no querell whan wrong is done vnto him. He is counted a foole, that doeth a good turne for a badde. He is eſtemed a Ioly
<pb facs="tcp:7459:316"/>
ruffler, that geueth him ſelfe to exceſſyue ryot: and he is counted a flyncher that foloweth ſobrietie. He is taken for a gaye felowe, that ſwelleth in haultynes, and loketh an heigth ouer menne of lower eſtimacion. He is counted happye, that hathe his matter to ſuccede in this worlde after hys owne purpoſe, that floweth in delicacies and voluptuous pleaſures, and ſerueth his paunche and glotonie. Theſe are the thinges, that in dede make a mannes ſoule wicked and vncleane: and he that abſteyneth from them, is a religious manne, (whoſoeuer is, whoſoeuer is not) in the ſight of God the father, who hathe exempted vs from earthy thinges, and called vs to heauenly thynges, and from the thinges that ſhall periſhe and are caſuall, vnto the thinges that are eternall: and hathe taught vs to eſteme the worthynes of manne by the thynges that are good in dede, and in all that we haue to doe, to geue reſpecte to none other purpoſe, but to hys glorye, at whoſe only handes the requitall of well doynges is to be truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for. And he doeth not requite the offices of true godlynes with tranſitorye and ſone peryſhing rewardes, as thys worlde is wonte to doe, but he geueth bleſſednes that neuer ſhall dye.

For yf there come into your company a man wearing a golden ryng, clothed in goodly apparell, and there come in alſo a poore manne in vyle rayment, and ye haue a reſpect to hym that weareth the gaye clothynge, and ſaye vnto him: Syt thou here in a good place: and ſaye vnto the poore: ſtande thou there, or ſyt here vnder my fote ſtole: are ye not parciall in youre ſelues, and haue iudged after euyll thoughtes? Harken my deare beloued brethren. Hath not God choſen the pore of thys worlde, ſoch as are rych in fayth, and heyres of the kyngdome, whiche he promyſed to them that loue hym? But ye haue deſpyſed the pore. Do not riche men execute tyrannye vpon you, and drawe you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the iudgement ſeates? Do not they ſpeake euyll of that good name whiche is called vpon ouer you?</q>

But to thys maner of Iudgement, a kyng or a riche man is not better of one Iote than any manne, howe baſſe or poore ſo euer he bee. Chriſte died for all indifferentlie, and all are indifferentlye called to thenhery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce of Immortalitie. Therfore my brethren, if you doe truly put your truſt in the promiſſes of our Lord Ieſu Chriſt, make no difference of perſones after the eſtimacion of worldly thinges. For Chriſt him ſelfe, as touchyng the world, was baſſe and poore. But yet it was the fathers will, that he ſhoulde be prince of all glorye.

                     <p>Is it to be thought, that the only profeſſion of faythe, is ynough of it ſelfe to obteyne ſaluacion? what is faythe without charytye? Charitie is a lyuely thing, it ceaſſeth not, it is not idle, it expreſſeth it ſelfe with good dedes dooing, wherſoeuer it is preſent. And if they want, my brethren, ſhall the vayne name of faythe (I praye you) ſaue a manne. The faythe is fruteles, that worketh not by charitie, yea it is no faythe but in title only. That which I haue ſayed, ſhall more cierely appeare by conference of an example. If a manne geue fayre wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des to a brother or a ſyſter, that wanteth clothynge or dayly ſuſtenaunce, and ſaye: Goe your waye in peace, get you heate, and get youre bely full of meate, and for all his ſo ſaying, geueth none of thoſe thynges that the bodye hathe nede of is not thys mannes fayre ſpeakynge vnprofytable to the pore nedye folkes? They ſhall ſtarue for colde, or bee an hyngred for al hys fayre tale that releueth not theyr neceſſitie. He releueth the in his word of mouth, but with his dede he doeth nothing at al. Of like ſorte doubtles ſhall the profeſſion of faith, whiche conſiſteth only in worde and worketh nothynge in dede, vee vnauayle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but lyeth ſlugging like as it were deade, neither is it to bee called faythe any more, than a deade corps of a manne is worthye to be called a manne. The thinge that the ſoule is vnto the body, the ſame is charitie vnto faythe: ſo that if charitie be taken aware, the worde of faythe is but a dead matter and vnef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall. Nether ſhall it do the any more good before God to profeſſe an idle faythe with thy mouthe, than fayre wordes do vnto the poore neighbour, where he ought to be holpen with dede. They thynke they are mocked, whan a manne ſayeth vnto them: get you heate, get youre bely full of meate, whan they haue nether clothe nor meate geuen them. Euen ſo he ſemeth to mocke God, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſeth euery daye: <hi>I beleue in God, I beleue in God,</hi> whan he ſhe weth no tokens of faythfull belefe.

Howbeit it doeth the no good at all to beleue there is God, &amp; that there is but one God, onles thou ſo beleue, that thou ſhalt of hym obteyne ſaluacion.

He hathe promyſed mercye, yea, but vnto them that in thys worlde exerciſe mercye towardes theyr neyghbour. He hathe promyſed eternall life, yea but to them that deſpyſe the pleaſures of thys worlde. Thys ſhalt thou not only beleue, there is but one god, but thou ſhalt alſo repoſe al thy whole truſt in hym only: or elles what frute ſhalt thou haue of thy beleuynge? The deuilles do alſo beleue, that God is, they beleue that Ieſus is the ſonne of God, and beleue it ſo muche, that they tremble and quake. But foraſmuche as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue onelye, and loue hym not, they are afrayed of punnyſhment at his hande, and hope not after rewarde: and where they fele hym to bee ryghteous, they are not woorthye to fele mercye ſeynge they are cruell agaynſte others. But and if thou be ſo very a fole, that thou yet ſtandeſt in thyne owne conceate hauing but a vayne faythe: gooe to, I ſhall brynge the forthe a more famylyar and a more knowen example, to teache the, that the faythe, whiche woorketh not through loue, is vnprofitable and deade. Abraham, of whome as oure head auncetour, we moſte chyeflye make vaunte, deſerued the fyrſte and pryncy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall commendacyon of faythe with God, of whome the reputacyon of rygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes was attrybuted vnto hym: but in hym faythe was not vnfrutefully baren. For he did not onely profeſſe with hys mouthe that he truſted in Goddes promyſſes, but alſo he doubted not to laye hys onlye ſonne Iſaac vpon thaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar and ſlea hym at Goddes commaundement, whereas after the ordre of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, there coulde no poſterytie bee truſted vpon to hym by anye other: but he laying hold on the promiſes of God whome he knew could raiſe euen the dead agayn to lyfe at hys pleaſure, ſticked not to do that he was commaunded. So that of his dedes he deſerued the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendacion of righteouſnes, yea but of thoſe dedes that proceded of faith. For ther are alſo workes of Moſes law, wherun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they truſt in vayne, that are without the faith of the goſpel. What is it, that that noble patriarke would not haue done, ſeing he went readily &amp; chearfully to the ſleaynge of hys only ſonne Iſaac, whome he loued ſo muche the more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlye, becauſe he was borne in hys extreme olde age, and becauſe that lucky poſteryty was promiſed in his name? He was pronounced righteous, euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bothe the matters dyd helpe eyther other. Faythe encouraged hym, not to feare to offre vp hys ſonne, whome he doubted not ſhoulde by the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente of Goddes power, by and by lyue agayne: but the notable dede ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it were, the fynall furnyture of the matter, declarynge vnto menne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that Abrahams ſtedfaſte faythe was neyther a deade nor a commune faithe. For he nother fayneth, nor doubteth, whiche ſtackreth not to auenture in hys onely ſonne whome he loued ſo ſyngularly. Woulde it greue hym to ſet naught by money for Chriſtes ſake, that is readye to leade hys ſonne, whome the father loued dearlier than he did hym ſelfe, vnto death? So than of thys ſo notable a document of faythe it manifeſtly appeareth to bee perfite, that the ſcripture ſayed: Abraham beleued God, and it was reckoned vnto hym for righteouſnes, and was called the frende of God.

And if the commendacion of righteouſnes chaunced not to them of the olde tyme, but to ſuche as tryed their faythe by theyr dedes: muche leſſe is it to be truſted vpon vnto them, that profeſſe the lawe of perfite charitie. But mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and liberalitie to the neyghbour is ſo muche auayleable with God, that a woman, that an harlot, that a ſtraunger was commended for keping of hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitalitie, and deſerued to be nombred in the regeſtre of Godly people, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtre of citezens, and in the regeſtre of the moſte tryedlye proued Patriarkes. Rhahab was not a Iewe, ſhe was mayſtres of a howſe of baldrye, and gate her lyuyng with no very honeſt gaynes of occupung: and yet in Goddes boke ſhe hathe a worthye commendacion of righteouſnes: not of faythe only, in that ſhe was perſuaded that no mannes good dedes ſhould be loſte, God being the rewarder namely that is beſtowed vpon good folkes or at leſte in the reſpecte of God: but of that, that ſhe not regarding the daunger of her life, prouided to ſaue the life of the ſpies, in that ſhe ſent out the meſſangers, whom the guide of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Iewes had ſente to ſpye, by ſtealth an other way, leſt they ſhould periſh.

But ſhe had rather ſerue the wyll of God, than her own gayne: nether dyſtruſted ſhe, but that ſhe ſhould bee repayed a more pleynteous rewarde of hym, than of menne.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe than as Abraham had the worthy praiſe of righteouſnes, not of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked faithe but of faythe tried by dedes, euen ſo Rhahab had beleued in vayne that the God of the Iewes is the true very God, excepte, whan occaſion ſerued, ſhe had declared by her dedes, that ſhe had beleued with her whole harte: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe faythe (as I ſayed) that is colde of charitie, and vttreth not it ſelfe, whan

Therfore he that taketh vpon hym the rowme of a byſhop, and of a teacher, muſte often and manye tymes examyne him ſelfe, whether he be mete to take that charge in hande: and let hym thinke thys ſpecially with him ſelfe, that he taketh a trauaile in hande endaungered with myghtie peryl, and ſhall rendre a moſte ſtreyght reconyng to the moſte highe Iudge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he teache otherwiſe than becometh him.

So is the tonge ſet amonge oure members, that it defyleth the whole body, and ſetteth a fyre all that we haue of nature, and is it ſelfe ſet a fyre euen of hell.

And at the begynnyng it myght haue ben holden down with a very litel a doo, but whan it is negligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let alone, it gathereth ſtrength on euery parte, &amp; groweth ſo farre at length, that it can be ſuppreſſed by no force.

Doe you not ſee that he, whiche wrought nature, ment the ſame by ſygnificaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in that he would haue mannes tongue to be bothe of the maner and colour of fyre, and to be warblinge and turnynge as the flame of fire is?

And like as a litel fyre is mingled with a greate rooke of fewell, ſo that by lytel and litell it ſetteth al the whole rooke on fyre: euen ſo the tongue is ſo mixed with the other membres of the body, that, if it be not reſtrained, it infecteth and defileth with his poyſon al the whole body, &amp; enflameth al the life of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with al maner flames of vices, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his cradle eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtil to his laſt age.

forthe fygges? No: but euery frute is lyke vnto hys owne tree, and hathe the verdour of the Iuyce of hys owne rote. Dooeth it not therfore ſeme to bee lyke a monſtre, that all one manne ſhoulde powre out of all one mouthe and through all one tongue, bothe godlynes and wickednes, trueth and lyeng, ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacion and deſtruccion? Therfore ſeing there is nothing more hurtfull than a wicked tongue, and nothyng more healthfull than a good and a learned ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, and ſeing the manne is ſeldome founde, that can youerne thys membre in all poyntes, that manne ought with all diligent endeuour to be choſen out of many, that muſte take in hande the trauaille of a teacher. Hym it behoueth to haue bothe a mynde quiet from all tumulte of gredye luſtes, and a conuerſaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on dyuorced from all vncleanes, that he maye not only teache thoſe thynges, that concerne true godlynes, but alſo to teache them with all gentilnes. For that doctrine that is contencious and wrangling, engendreth nothyng elles, but faccions and fallyng out. And amonge the wiſe of thys worlde, he beareth the bell, that diſputeth with moſte ſtiffenes in opinions, and that is ſo buſye tongued, that he geueth place to no bodye. Nether is thys done, that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be the better whan he goeth away, but that he that getteth the maiſtry maye be the prowder, and he that is ouercomen maye be the more lowted. And in the meane ſeaſon the commune ſorte is at diſagreyng amonge them ſelues, ſome after thys mynde ſome after that, ſo as neither the ſpeaker can haue any ſure grounded frute, ne yet the hearer. But among you that profeſſe the philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy of the Goſpell, who ſo euer is truly wiſe, and endued with true wiſedom, let hym not declare hym ſelfe wyſe in hyghe ſtately and contencious maner of reaſonyng, but let hym teſtifie by goldy and entier vpright maners, what he is, rather than in wordes. For lyke as faith is vnprofitable, like as charitie is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, that is doone but only in wordes, euen ſo is wiſedome, whiche do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not fyrſte trye it ſelfe by gentilnes of maners. For this is the chiefe token, wherby a manne may knowe the humayne phyloſophy from the Euangelical. The profeſſours of humayne philoſophye are curious, ſtiffe in opynyon, and fearce. But the philoſophie of the Goſpell, the more ſyncere it is, the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent it is, ſo muche leſſe high ſtatelynes it hathe. And the chief powre of it conſiſteth, not in ſubtill reaſonynges of ſyllogiſmes, or tricked fyne termes of eloquence, but in ſynceritie of life, in ſoftenes of maners, that geueth place to contencious perſones, and allureth ſuche as are apte to be taught, nether reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth it any thing elles than the health of the hearers. It is an heauenly wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and he that teacheth it, muſte neceſſaryly haue a mynde cleane ſcowred from all earthlye luſtes, for it muſte nedes be drawen for the of a ſyncere cleane veſſell. But if you haue myndes defiled with bitter enuying amonge your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, if you haue an harte corrupt with contencious, and with ſtubburne yma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynyng to haue the vpper hande and with enuye, lay awaye rather the office of teaching, than in ſeruing your owne glory and contencious maner, to lye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte the Goſpelles veritie, whiche no manne can ſet forthe ſyncerely, onles hys mynde bee free from all humayne affeccions. Therfore, who ſo euer ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this profeſſion in hande, if he fele hys mynd infecte with humayne loue or hate, if with malicious crueltie, deſire of renowme, gredy couering of money or with loue of uoluptuous pleaſures: let him fyrſte diligently purge the inward partes of hys mynde, that he maye goe pure vnto the teachyng of that moſte pure doctrine.

But the ſpirite of the Goſpell, which now dwelleth in you, is full of geloſie, and (as I may ſo ſpeake) enuious: he requireth more, for he wyll bee vehemently loued agayne, ſo that for hys ſake he will haue wife, chyldern, yea and euen lyfe contemned. He canne not abyde to haue his reſting houſe defyled with worldly luſtes: he requireth pure cleane thinges, he requireth heauenly thynges, he leapeth backe, he run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth away, he is offended, if a manne bring the ſluttiſh filthynes of thys world in to hys temple. Howbeit like as he requireth of vs a certayne exceadynge greate loue, and a greate deale purer loue, than Moſes lawe dooeth, euen ſo it geueth a more plenteous grace. It is a very hard matter to accomplyſh that it requireth, but it geueth ſtrength to thys ende, that we maye eaſylye doo it. There is nothynge harde to the louing willer. This ſame is hys gyfte, that we ſhoulde loue him, or rather loue him agayne. He drewe vs with hys loue fyrſt, and whan we were turned from hym, he reconciled vs agayn vnto hym. He will encreaſe hys giftes in vs, in caſe we geue our ſelues all together and wholy vnto him, if we depend of hym onely and of none but him, if we haue nothyng a doe with this worlde, nor with the deuill the prynce of the worlde.

Backbytynge one of an other, maketh other folke to thinke the worſe of them both, nether is there any more preſent a poyſon vnto chriſtian concorde. Nowe he that back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteth his brother, or condemneth his neyghbour, dooeth wronge not onlye to him, whome he backbiteth, but alſo vnto the law, whome he appeareth to back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite and condemne. If thy brother be faultles, if it be not forbydden by the law, that he dooeth: with what face dooeſt thou damne the thynge that the lawe of the Goſpell damneth not? but and if he be faultye, why doeſt thou bewray with thy backbytynge tongue, hym that ought to be punnyſhed by the lawe? The lawe of the Goſpell byddeth, that we iudge not one an other, that we condemne not one an other: and vnder pretenſe of the lawe we dooe after our owne affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions. He that is the offendour, ſhall haue a iudge of his owne, why dooeſt thou than take his office vpon thee before the tyme? For thou goeſt not aboute to haue him amended but to be wondred vpon. Therfore who ſo euer backbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his neighbour, he either condemneth the lawe, in that it correcteth not filthynes, or backbiteth it as though it were to muche myngle mangled, and walowyſhe, the office wherof the backbytour taketh vpon hym. The worlde hathe here publike lawes to punnyſhe faultes. But it is the parte of chriſtian ſoftenes, to endeuour the amendement of all menne, rather than to iudge them. There is but one lawe maker, whiche is hable bothe to ſaue and to ſpill. And thinkeſt thou, that it is kepte ſecret from him that euery manne doeth offende? perchaunce he ſuffreth the offendour, that he maye ones repent, and he ſuffreth hym that he maye in his time punnyſhe him the more greuouſlye.</p>

The lorde forſoke not his ſtowte champion, but in laying vpon hym ſo many ſorowes, he wolde haue his pacience recorded and ſeene: yea and that mercyfull lorde, and of his owne nature ready vnto clemencye, turneth vnto vs an other mannes malyce into the heape and vauntage of felycitie. Let youre mynde bee pure and playne, and let youre harte and youre mouthe gooe bothe together. Let no man with feyned wordes deceaue his neighbour, but eſpecyally my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſweare not: leſt by lytell and litell you accuſtume your ſelues to forſweare you.

But amonge Chriſtians, whiche ought nether to diſtruſt any manne, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be in will to deceaue, it is a vayne thyng to ſweare.

Who ſo euer dare be bolde to lye without ſwearinge, he dare do the ſame alſo when he ſweareth, if he luſte. To be brief, he that is a good manne will beleue a manne without ſwearyng, and he that naught is, will not truſte a manne though he ſweare. But amonge you that are furnyſhed with Goſpellike playneſſe, there is nether place of dyſtruſtinge, ne to ymagin deceate. But let youre playne communicacion bee regarded for no leſſe true and ſtedfaſte, than any maner of othe of the Iewes or Paganes, how holy ſo euer it bee. As often as you confirme any thynge, confirme it with all youre harte: and performe in dede the thinge that you ſpeake.

Would you fayne haue a doctrine of thys matter? Helyas was a pure manne, he was a mortall manne as we are, and yet at his prayers it rayned not vpon the earthe thre yeares and ſixe monethes.

Now weight this, brethren, if it be godly, if it be the partes of chriſtyan loue, to eaſe the ſickenes of an other mannes bodye through commune prayers: how muche more indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent reaſon is it, that we ſhoulde ſuccour them that be diſeaſed in mynde?

                     <q>And this is the tydinges which we haue hearde of hym and declare vnto you, that God  is light, and in him is no darckenes at all. If we ſaie, that we haue felowſhip with him, and walke in darckenes, we lye, and do not the trueth. But and yf we walke in light euen as he is in light, then haue we felowſhip with him, &amp; the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt his ſonne clenſeth vs from all ſynne. If we ſaye that we haue no ſynne, we deceaue our ſelues, and the trueth is not in vs. If we knowledge our ſinnes, he is faythfull and iuſt to forgeue vs oure ſynnes, and to clenſe vs from all vnrighteweſnes. If we ſay, we haue not ſynned, we make hym a lyar, and hys worde is not in vs.</q>
                     <p>What is the matter than, whiche we ſhewe vnto you, that you myght the more fully reioyce? In dede it is that, whiche we haue heard euen of him, and
<pb facs="tcp:7459:329"/>
hauing heard it we make it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune vnto you: that God, foraſmuch as he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together and of his own nature good, all wiſe, al pure, and al light &amp; life, nether is ther any darkenes in him. In vs the matter ſtandeth not after ſuch ſorte, but we haue muche darkenes euen of our ſelues: in caſe we haue any light, we are endebted in that all to gether vnto him, by whoſe free liberality we are deliuered from our olde ſynnes, and being deliuered from the darkenes of our former ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce we haue learned by the Goſpelles doctrine to liue godly after Chriſte our heades example. If any manne boaſt, that he is through baptiſme engraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed to the body of Chriſte, and hathe therby felowſhippe with God the father: where as in the meane while he liueth yet in errours &amp; vices of hys former lyfe, dooeth playnly lye. For ſeing (as I ſayed before) God is farre from all maner felowſhip of darkenes: how can he poſſibly haue any thynge a dooe with hym, that lyueth yet ſtill all together in errour and olde vices? For he is clene out of the waye, that thinketh he can atteyne Innocencie by any other meanes than by Chriſt: agayne he is deceaued, that thinketh it ynough for him to be waſhen in baptiſme, except he be anſwerably like vnto his profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of life? he that thinketh thus, is deceaued, and he lieth that ſayeth it. For Chriſte is the trueth, whiche hathe nothing a doo with lyers. The fyrſte ſteppe vnto light, is for a manne to acknowlage his darkenes: and the fyrſt ſtepping forthe of a manne vnto Innocencie, is to acknowlage his ſinnes. Will ye heare therfore, by what token we maye knowe, that we haue true feloweſhippe with God? Doubtles euen by thie: if like as he is light, and voyde of all darkenes, euen ſo ſhall we abſteyne after his example from the darkenes of all errours and vices, framyng all our conuerſacion after the light of the Goſpell: and yf like as the ſonne hathe moſt high concorde with the father: euen ſo ſhoulde we alſo lyue Innocently and be all of one mynde amonge our ſelues. The father will not laye the traunſgreſſions of our olde life vnto our charge, whiche are ones doone awaye all the ſorte of them by the precious blood of his ſonne Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu Chriſte, ſo that we from henceforthe abſteyne from all ſynne, as muche as in vs lyethe. The blood of Chriſte hathe waſhed awaye all fylthynes, and hathe waſhen it away from all folkes: yea but he hathe waſhen none but thoſe that acknowlage theyr faultes. Yf we ſaye that we are not endaungered with ſynne, we deceaue our ſelues, we lyue in errour, we wandre in darkenes: and Chriſte, which is light, whiche is trueth is not in vs. For if he were truly in vs in dede, he would diſpatche awaye thys darkenes of arrogaunt ignoraunce. And if it ſhall chaunce vs after receyuing of baptiſme, to ſlyde backe agayne through mannes weaknes in to any ſynne, and as it were a myſte obſcure our light: we muſte beware, that arrogauncie withdrawe vs not farther and farther of, and leade vs agayne from light in to our olde darkenes. Yea we muſte geue dily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that through diſcrete ſobrenes we maye be admoued vnto the light that ſhall diſpatche awaye all darknes. If the brother perchaunce doo treſpaſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſte the brother, let eyther forgeue other hys treſpaſſe, that God maye forgeue them alſo the treſpaſſes that are done agaynſte him. For in dede God hathe vpon this condicion promyſed to forgeue vs, what ſo euer we haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended againſte him, if we forgeue our brothers fault: and exacteth hys debte (euen to the vttermoſte farthinge) of him, whiche hauyng hys lorde mercifull vnto him, ſhewed him ſelfe ſmally mercifull towardes his felowe ſeruaunt: that is to ſaye, he iudgeth him vnworthye the mercye of God ſeinge he ones frely
<pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:7459:329"/>
forgaue him all his treſpaſſes, that will not pardone a ſmale offence vnto hym, agaynſt whome he eyther treſpaſſeth euery daye, or elles maye treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace. That man wyll eaſyly forgeue hym that treſpaſſeth agaynſte hym, whiche wyll remembre howe many wayes he offendeth both agaynſt God and agaynſt his neyghbour: And as it is a very hard matter for a man to do ſo as he offende in nothing, euen ſo is it a verye eaſye mater to amende ſuche offences with forgeuing one an other. Forgeue thou thy neighbour, and thy neyghbour ſhall forgeue thee agayne: and God ſhall, euen as it were of very couenaunt, forgeue you both. I ſpeake of thoſe faultes, that chaunce euen among them that are good, yea but among men: and thoſe faultes, that obſcure the lyght of the Goſpelles veritie, rather than extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guyſhe it. For God forbydde, that manſlaughter, or whoredome, or ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege ſhoulde chaunce vpon their life, that are ones choſen among the chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God. There is nothing that allureth more the mercie of God, and ſwageth his wrath, than yf a man acknowlage his faulte to God. If he that is a fearce cruel man forgeue him that acknowlageth his faulte, how muche more ſhall God do ſo, which is more mercifull than any man? He is by nature readyly bent vnto mercie, and hath promiſed vs forgeuenes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this condicion: <hi>forgeue, and it ſhalbe forgeuen vnto you.</hi> If he would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geue, in that he is good: yet he ſhuld forgeue becauſe he is iuſt &amp; of faithful credence. See that thou accomplyſhe the preſcribed condicion, and he ſhal not forget his couenaunt. If we with our whole harte forgeue our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that offendeth vs, God ſhall alſo forgeue vs, not onely one ſynne or an other, but all ſynnes: ſo that we to our powers geue diligence, that we may be once voyde of all vices. And yf we be not able fully to attayne vnto that for the frayltie of mannes body, yet he of his liberal free goodnes ſhal make good, that is wantynge in our ſtrengthes, and ſhall cleanſe vs from all our offences, who perchaunce ſuffereth ſome tokens of our olde former lyfe to remayne ſtil in vs, for this purpoſe, that we ſhould acknowlage our weakenes. For in dede he is better content<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with a ſinner that miſliketh him ſelfe, than with a righteous that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtandeth in his own conceite. He would that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſaluacion of men ſhoulde be aſcribed vnto his mercy, and not to our merytes. And nowe hathe he teſtified, that there is no mortall manne on yearth, but he offendeth in ſome thyng. And yf we wyl ſay, that we haue no ſynne in vs, we make wod a lyar, and ſay agaynſt hym: and he that gayne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayeth hym muſt nedes lye.</p>

As for you, let thoſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges fraye you whiche are euill in dede, and neuer haue ende. And let theſe thinges catche you that are good in dede and knowe none ende. Folowe the lyght of the goſpell and loue heauenly thynges, whiche the heauenlye father promyſeth, vnto whom you are regenerate by Chriſt. Flee the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of naughtie luſtes, wherby this worlde layeth bayte with countrefaict goodes. It can not poſſiblie be, that you can loue bothe at ones, nor ſerue both at ones. There is none agrement betwene God and the worlde, there is no concorde betwene lyght and darknes: whoſoeuer loueth the worlde, ſwarueth from the loue of God the father. I ſpeake not of this worlde, which god made, wherin we liue, wil we nil we. The wiked gredy deſires of vayne thinges (wherein the common ſort of menne repoſe their felicitie, forgetting the thinges that are truely good in dede) I cal the world. It is not the place, howe farre of ſo euer it be, not the raymente, not the meate, not the title, that exemteth you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the world, but a mind that is pure from thoſe deſires y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> I ſpake of. And what hath this world, that is not noiſomly hurtful? There are thre thinges, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it moſt chefely deceineth foliſhe &amp; vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect folkes withall: the voluptuous pleaſure of the fleſhe, enticemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the eies, and hyghe ſtatelynes and proude galauntnes of lyfe. For it obiecteth certayne iugglinges of vayne pleaſures to clawe the ſenſes of the bodye withall for a tyme, that the mynde maye in the meane while be called awaye from the ſtudie of heauenlye good thynges. For the deſyre of ſuche maner of good thynges, the heauenlye ſpirite ſuggeſteth, whom God the father geueth vnto his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are truly regenerate by Chriſt. The deuill hath alſo a ſpirite of his owne, by whom he ſuggeſteth a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious loue of thynges neyther true nor durable, vnto them that haue bent themſelues throughly vnto this worlde. He ſuggeſteth the naughtye ſportes of lechery, to title the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bres of the body withal through a foliſhe and a filthy itching delite. He ſuggeſteth the delite of fyne meates &amp; drinke to pleaſe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> paunche &amp; the mouth w<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>al. He ſuggeſteth the ſwetnes of idlenes &amp; ſlepe, that the mynde may waxe the more ſluggiſhe throughe cuſtume,
<pb facs="tcp:7459:332"/>
He ſuggeſteth wanton ſonges and ſhameles fables, to anoynt the eares withall. He ſuggeſteth the wanton enticementes of beawties and ſondry kyndes of thinges to beholde, to delite the eies withall. He ſuggeſteth the pompes and ioylitie of riches, the occaſions of ambicion. Finally he allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth mennes myndes on euery parte awaye from the true and euerlaſting good thinges vnto the vayne imaginacions of good thinges. Let him that is entangled with the deſire of theſe thinges, knowe that he is not moued by the ſpirite of the heauenly father, but by the ſpirite of the worlde. The worlde, lyke as it conſiſteth vpon elementes that endure but for a time, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo geueth it nothing but that whiche ſhall ſhortly periſhe. God, like as he is eternall, euen ſo geueth he freely euerlaſting rewardes. Therefore he that dependeth vpon the ſuccours of the worlde, foloweth a certayne feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie that is both vayne and ſhall ſhortly be taken awaie, which, euen caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie that commeth vnthought vpon, plucketh away in this worlde, or at leſt age diſpatcheth it. Truly death that ſhall come vn to euery man, pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth quite awaye all the dreame of falſe pleaſures. Whan the mater is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken awaye, the pleaſure periſheth, and ſorowes come in place. Whan the man is taken away, al is gone to naught, and euerlaſting torment cometh in place.

You haue hearde that Antichriſt ſhall come, who being armed with all the mayntenaunce and iugglinges of this worlde, ſhoulde kepe warre againſt Chriſte, and by and by when Antichriſte is ouercomme againe, the body of Chriſte ſhalbe deliuered from all euils, and the membres of the deuill ſhall be laden with the burthens of all euilles. Therfore the commynge of thys Antichriſt, (of whom the Apoſtles tolde you before) ſemeth not to be farre
<pb n="xlvii" facs="tcp:7459:332"/>
of. For thys worlde hath ſo muche preuayled agaynſte the doctrine of the Goſpell, that there are begonne euen nowe all readye to be a great ſorte, that deſerue the name of Antichriſt, whoſe lyfe and doctrine and all theyr hole ſtudye is agaynſt Chriſt. For what appeare they to be elles, than An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtes gentilmen huſſhers, and the laſt tokens of the plage to come? For they do leſſe hurt vnto Chriſtes people that be vtterly ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers from Chriſt, than thoſe that being ones conuerſaunt in his caſtelles, and by and by become runneagates, aſſault Chriſte with Chriſtes owne gariſons and armour. For they countrefaite euen thoſe thinges, whiche declare in chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, the vertue, the holynes, the doctrine, the auctoritie, the miracles of Chriſt. And in dede they went out of vs, howbeit there is no matter, why they ſhould much trouble you, they were conuerſaunt among vs, but they were none of ours. They were enemies of Chriſte, euen whan they were dwelling in his caſtelles. But and if they had truely bene on our ſyde, they wolde haue continued ſtil to thende with vs. They profeſſed Chriſt in title and behauiour, but in their mynde they loued the worlde vehemently. And therfore when it is come to the ſtormes of perſecucions, whan it is come to the flame of affliccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, they haue ſhewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, what they were before. Nowe they are out from vs, they extolle vs, as a body ouerlayed with euil humours, and now being open enemies they ſhall leſſe hurt, than holowe harted companions. Thus it was Chriſtes wyll, that it may euidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that all belonge not to the bodye of Chriſte, that are waſhen in his name, that profeſſe his name, and are partakers of the ſacramentes of the Churche. A true and ſtedfaſt diſpiſing of the world ſheweth a man to be a Chriſtian. A mynde that is vnbroken and vnconquered agaynſt al wanton enticeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, agaynſt all iniuries, ſheweth a man to be a Chriſtian. He that vpon occaſion ſhrinketh from the doctrine of Chriſte, dyd countrefaicte a chriſtianne, but he was no chriſtian. In dede it is expedient that they be openly ſeperated from vs, leſt in outward appearaunce ſeming to be good, they ſhould do the more harme to them that are not ware. Although they were not vnknowen vnto you, yea before they withdrewe themſelues o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly. For the vnccion of Chriſt, wherof you are alſo named, that is to ſaye the inſpiracion of the ſpirite of Chriſt, ſheweth playnly ynough who are true chriſtians, and who are not. For he that is a ſpirituall man, iudgeth althynges. They were not vnknowen, but they were borne with al, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce they woulde repent. It is true that I ſaye: neither doe I wryte theſe thinges vnto you, as thoughe you were ignoraunt of the trueth, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng you haue the ſpirite of Chriſt to your teacher, which ſuffereth you not to be ignoraunt of any thing: but I put you in remembraunce of the thyng that you know, to thintent you myght y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> more ſurely ſticke vnto the trueth, and not to be diſquieted whan ſorowes do happen. You are the fewer, but you are the ſounder, you are the more purely clenſed, you are the quieter. Nothing is taken away of the body, though the botche be launced, though the corrupt matter be runne out. You knowe that Chriſt is the trueth, and all kynde of lyeng is cleane contrarie to him. Whoſoeuer is an holowhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted diſſembler, with him Chriſte hath nothing adoe, howe faſte ſo euer he profeſſe him with his mouthe. There are manye facions of lyenges. He that is a lyar, by what maner waye ſoeuer it be, denieth Chriſte, whiche is
<pb facs="tcp:7459:333"/>
the trueth, and receyueth no mixture of any kinde of lye. He that is agaynſt the trueth, is agaynſt Chriſt: he that is agaynſte Chriſte is Antichriſt. And there is none more wicked a kynde of lyeng, than to denye that Ieſus is Chriſt: and that do many falſe prophetes of the Iewes, whiche denie hym to be he, whom Moſes and the prophetes oracles did long agoe promiſe vnto the worlde to be the reuenger, and autor of ſaluacion: and promyſe an other Antichriſt I wote not whom, in ſtede of Chriſte. Doubtles who ſo euer is ſuch a one, is playne Antichriſt. Agayne there are, that although they profeſſe with their mouthe, that Ieſus is Chriſte, yet they lyue after ſuch ſorte, as though his doctrine were vayne, as thoughe the rewardes that he hathe promyſed were vayne. He taught, that the pore in ſpirite are bleſſed, becauſe the kyngdome of heauen abydeth for them. And an other man which applieth al his whole forcaſt to this end, to enlarge his landes, to buylde royall houſes, to enhau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce his rentes, to ſtuffe his coafers with money gotten by hoke and by crooke, to be aloft in autoritie, to oppreſſe the poore, and to exerciſe tyrannie: doeth he not cleane contrary vnto Chriſt, whoſe doctrine he maketh a lyar, as much as in hym lyeth? Chriſt taught, that they are bleſſed, whiche hungre and thirſt after ryghteouſnes: and an other repoſeth his felicitie in ryot, in the pleaſures of the paunche and bely cheare: doeth he not denye Chriſt? He teacheth, that the meke are bleſſed, becauſe they ſhall poſſeſſe that heauenly lande, from whence they can not be caſt downe. And an other man thinketh him happye, yf he can with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of the pore eſtabliſhe his owne wealthe. He teacheth that they are bleſſed, whiche mourne in this world, becauſe euerlaſting comforte is due vnto them. And an other man that in all thynges foloweth the delicate pleaſures of this worlde: doeth he not denie Chriſt? He teacheth, that thei are bleſſed, whiche are mercifull towardes their neyghbours. And this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pleaſeth him ſelfe, becauſe of his owne accorde he doeth him ſorowe that is better than himſelfe. Chriſte teacheth that they are bleſſed, whiche are vexed with reuylyng wordes and affliccions for the rightuouſnes of the Goſpelles ſake. And this man forcaſteth with al maner of diſſembling and wyles to pleaſe the world. Chriſt acknowledgeth him for his diſciple, that taketh vp his croſſe on his ſhoulders, and foloweth him. And an other man thinketh himſelfe neuertheles chriſten man, if he eſcape all grief.</p>
                     <p>Chriſte ſayeth vnto his: <hi>In the VVorlde you ſhall haue oppreſſion, but in me you ſhall haue peace:</hi> and yet vnto theſe men Chriſt is heauie, &amp; the worlde ſwete. He commaundeth to do good euen vnto a mannes enemye, and an other doth wrong to a man without deſerte. Doth not he, that lyueth after ſuch ſorte, reſiſtingly denie Chriſt? his mouth ſayeth not agaynſt him, but hys life doth. Whan the ſonne taught agaynſt theſe maners, the father ſayed, <hi>Heare him.</hi> But what ſayeth this manne? No, heare not him, it is harde geare that he teacheth, heare the worlde. Therfore like as he reſiſteth the ſonne, euen ſo doethe he repugne agaynſte the father, and ſeynge he is of the facion of the worlde, he diſſeuereth himſelfe from the flocke of them, whom Chriſt hath choſen out of this worlde. Chriſte hath nothing a doe with this worlde, and he that glueth himſelf vnto it, repugneth agaynſte Chriſt. and playeth Antichriſt, and denieth both the father and the ſonne. For the father and the ſonne are of an vnſeperable ſocietie. Here the Iewe
<pb n="xlvii" facs="tcp:7459:333"/>
wyll crye with open mouthe agaynſte me: I acknowlage the father, but the ſonne I acknowlage not. But what ſoeuer thou treſpaceſt agaynſt the ſonne, thou treſpaceſt the ſame agaynſt the father. The ſonne neuer did nor taughte any thing, but by the auctoritie of the father. He that taketh from the ſonne, taketh from the father. Therfore he that eſtraungeth him ſelfe from the felowſhip of the ſonne, he neither pertaineth to the body of Chriſt, whiche is the catholike churche, nor hath felowſhippe with God the father, whiche agreeth in all thinges with the ſonne. You ſee with what great Ieoperdie foles diſſeuer themſelues from the ſonne. Therefore continue you ſtyll in the goſpelles trueth, which you receiued firſt of the ſurely tried Apoſtles. Let not the lyeng tales of the falſe Apoſtles drawe you awaye.</p>

And leite no manne flatter hym ſelfe, ſayinge: It is ynough for me vnto innocency, if I tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgreſſe in none of thoſe thinges that Moſes lawe forbyddeth, nor in thoſe thynges that are punyſhed by the kynges lawes, as felonye, ſacrilege, adultrie, murdre: but all maner of ſynne is vtterly to be eſchewed. For whoſoeuer offendeth by any meane, although he offende not agaynſt the preſcriptes of Moſes, yet he ſynneth agaynſt the lawe of the goſpell, whiche is a greate deale holyer than Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes law. And for thys cauſe ſake, Chriſt came once into the world, to ſhew the waye, whereby his comming agayne ſhoulde become holeſome and luckye vnto vs. He came to take awaye once for all not one ſynne or two, but al our ſynnes, where he onely was ſubiect vnto no maner of ſynne. He once purged vs frely from all ſynne, to make vs lyke manered vnto hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, whiche neither any lawe nor any mortall man coulde be hable to do. Through baptiſme we are engraffed into hys holy ſacred body. But it is our part for all that to endeuour in the meane tyme, that we fall not from our head. We are engraffed through his owne free mercy, but we ſhal fall awaye, if we ſlyde backe agayne into oure olde vices. He that abydeth in Chriſt, perſeuereth in innocencye, and is wonderous ware to ſhunne from all ſinne, that he may dayly more and more growe in vertues, and be made more lyke hys head. He that abſteyneth not from ſinnes, although he bee baptiſed, although he be called a chriſtian, hath not yet ſene fully, nor yet knowen hym. For who is it, yf he ſawe with the eies of fayth, what greate dignitie it is to be choſen into the numbre of the ſonnes of God, and what a fylthy ſhame it is to be geuen to the father deuyll, that woulde abyde to be plucked awaye from ſuche a bodye, to departe from ſuche a father, and to go out of kynde vnto ſo fylthy a tirannye, to ſlyde of his owne accorde awaye from ſo hygh rewardes vnto ſo greate miſerie?</p>

And of theſe three there is all one moſt perfite agrement: the father is the autor, the ſonne the meſſanger, the holy gooſt the remembrauncer. There are three thinges alſo on earthe, that beare recorde vnto Chriſt: his humayne ſpirite whiche he put from him one the croſſe: the water and the bloode, that ranne out of his ſyde whan he was deade. And theſe three witneſſes doe agree The other declared him to be God, theſe recorde that he was man. Iohn alſo bare witneſſe. And yf we receyue witneſſe of men, it is reaſon, that the witneſſe of God be of more importaunce with vs. For the teſtimonie of God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is manifeſt: <hi>Thys is my VVelbeloued Sonne, in VVhom I am pleaſed, heare him.</hi> What thing can be ſpoken more plainly or more fully? he that beleueth truly in goddes ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, and hath repoſed al the ſuccours of his lyfe in him, ſo that truſting in his promiſſes he contemneth all thinges, that this worlde can make a ſhewe of, whether they be amiable or dreadfull, hathe a witneſſe in him ſelfe, and beareth witneſſe vnto the ſonne of God. For whan (throughe thinſpiracion of the ſpirite of Chriſte) he defieth euen deathes for his loue, he beareth no trifling witneſſe vnto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they are no vaine thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges that Chriſt hath taught and promiſed. He that truſteth not in god, but putteth his truſt in the worlde, he, as muche as in him is, maketh god a lyer, whiche hath promiſed felicitie vnto them that woulde herke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto his ſonne Ieſu Chriſt: where as he in his conuerſacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> teacheth that felicitie is to be aſked of the worlde, &amp; cleaueth ſo vnto the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities of this lyfe, as thoughe nothing of a man remayned after the deathe of the bodye. The father cryeth: <hi>Heare him.</hi> And his lyfe, that beleueth not, ſayeth: Heare the worlde. For whan the ſonne prayed the father, that thoſe whiche beleued or ſhoulde beleue in him, might haue eternall lyfe, the fathers voyce was heard, teſtifiyng as by the ſound of a trompet, that his prayers ſhould be allowed. The father therfore hath geuen vs euerlaſtyng lyfe, ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winge of whome it ſhould be aſked, euen of his ſonne Ieſus Chriſte. His doctrine who ſoeuer embraceth, his example whoſoeuer foloweth, hys promiſes whoſoeuer truſteth vnto, he bothe poſſedeth the ſonne and hath life: the pledge wherof he kepeth in the meane time, euen the ſpirite of god, throughe the vndoubted confidence whereof he is bolde to call God, father: He that is a ſtraunger from the ſonne, is eſtraunged alſo from lyfe.</p>

                     <q>Theſe thinges haue I written vnto you that beleue on the name of the ſonne of god, that ye  maye knowe, howe that ye haue eternall lyfe, and that ye maye beleue on the name of the ſonne of god. And thys is the truſt that we haue in hym: that yf we aſke any thyng accordinge to hys wyll, he heareth vs. And yf we knowe that he heare vs whatſoeuer wee aſke, we knowe, that we haue the peticions, that we deſire of hym. If any man ſee his brother ſinne a ſynne not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, let hym aſke, and he ſhall geue hym lyfe for them that ſinne not vnto death. There is a ſynne vnto death, for whiche ſaye I not that a man ſhoulde praye. All vnrighteouſnes is ſin, and ther is a ſynne not vnto death. We knowe, that whoſoeuer is borne of god, ſynneth not: but he that is begotten of god, kepeth himſelfe, and that wicked toucheth hym not. We know, that we are of god, and the worlde is all together ſet on wickednes. We knowe, that the ſonne of god is come, and hath geuen vs a mynde to knowe hym, whiche is true: and wee are in him that is true, through his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt. This ſame is very god, and eternal lyfe. Babes, kepe your ſelues from images. Amen.</q>

                        <pb facs="tcp:7459:340"/>Theſe thinges therfore doe I repete and beate vnto you with ſo many wordes, leſt any man ſhoulde perſuade vnto you the contrarye. But take it for a ſure and an vndoubted certayntie, that it is true whiche you haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued: that euerlaſtynge lyfe is ordayned for you throughe Ieſus Chriſte, whoſe ioyned felowe heires you are. You haue already the ryght clayme and gage, and ſhall haue poſſeſſion of the thyng ſelfe in hys tyme. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you that beleue in the ſonne of God, beleue ſtedfaſtlye, and put youre ſure truſt in hym daylye more and more. He wyll not fayle you in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſes of euerlaſtyng lyfe, that fayleth you not nowe euen in thys lyfe. For in dede the ſpirite of Chriſte geuethe this confidence vnto you, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer you ſhal aſke in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> name of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne, you ſhould obtaine it, if ye aſke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to hys wyll, that is, yf you be ſuche when you come to praye as he woulde haue you to come: that is to ſaye, pure from all maner hate of your brother. (For he obteyneth nothyng at goddes hande, of whom his neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour obteyneth not forgeuenes of his fault:) And if you aſke thoſe thinges that are auaileable to the lyfe of heauen, and make to the glorye of Chriſt. Or elles we for the moſte parte knowe not what we ſhoulde aſke of God, and many tymes for holſome thynges we deſire hurtfull thynges, yf the ſpirite of Chriſte put vs not in mynde, what were expedient for vs to aſke: but as ofte as we aſke after thys ſorte, we are ſure that god heareth oure prayers: we are ſure that he wyll frely geue vs whatſoeuer we ſhall aſke. So hath he promiſed vs, and is hable to performe whatſoeuer he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and wyll performe whatſoeuer is holſome for vs. Neither ſhall he onely encreaſe his giftes in vs, being prouoked therunto by oure prayers, but alſo he wyll pardon vs oure daylye offences, without whome the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes of mans nature can ſcarcely be hable to endure longe: and he ſhall not onely pardon euery one hys offences, yf he deſire pardon, but he ſhall alſo heare the brother praying for the brothers offences, ſo that the ſinne bee of ſuche ſorte, that it doeth not quenche out brotherly loue, althoughe it doe ſomewhat obſcure it. For there is a ſynne that cannot bee imputed vn to weakenes, nor be healed with lyght and eaſye remedies: as whan a manne vpon a ſette malyce perſecuteth the chriſten felowſhyppe, where he hymſelfe hath profeſſed Chriſte, and in pretence of religion goeth aboute to ſubuert religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The deſperate frowardnes of ſuche a one deſerueth not the prayer of godly menne: and yet perfite charitie prayeth alſo for ſuche, wyſhynge for thoſe thynges that cannot poſſiblye be done. There is no manne that prayeth for the deuyll, becauſe he doeth wittynglye throughe malyce oppugne them, whome God woulde well vnto. Perhappes no prayer ſhould alſo be made for them, that are tranſlated into hys affeccion: and are rather to be ſhunned, that they doe no harme, than to bee releued with prayers, excepte they ſhewe an hope of their repentaunce. Suche a diſeaſe nedeth more ſtrong remedies, and is greater, than can bee taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by dayly praiers, wherby lighter offences are taken away, which are done of feble weakenes, &amp; not of purpoſed frowardenes. Whatſoeuer is committed beſyde perfite righteouſnes, is ſin: but there be many differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſynnes. There is ſome ſynne, whiche althoughe it demynyſhe and blotte innocencye, yet it vtterlye quencheth not out chriſtian charytye: as whan by occaſion we ouerſhote a worde agaynſte oure frende, whiche
<pb n="liiii" facs="tcp:7459:340"/>
we are ſory for by and by that it ouer ſhot vs: whan a ſodayne angre hath ruſſhed out at a worde, that wee woulde wyſhe by and by myghte bee called backe agayne: whan throughe the ſwetenes of meate or drynke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuyng, wee take ſomewhat more then the neceſſitie of nature doeth require. And to pardon theſe offences God is eaſie, yf he bee called vpon with mutual prayers. Suche maner of faultes of children, thoſe that be gentyll parentes doe for the moſte parte wynke at, whiche woulde not ſuffre greater offences. Albeit there is none ſo lyght a faulte that ought to be neclected. Whatſoeuer is done amyſſe, is euyll and to bee eſchewed of godlye folkes, and yf it bee neclected, it drawethe by lytell and lytell vnto deathe. But lyke as ſpedye remidy oughte to be had for theſe lighter offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whiche men are ſcarce hable to auoyde: euen ſo god forbydde, that he whiche hath once renounced the worlde, and dedicated hymſelfe vnto god, ſhoulde be tombled backe agayne into anye greate notable cryme. By pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpel we are made the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, and membres of Chriſt. And it is not conuenient, that the children ſhould diffre ſo greatly from the father, and the membres from the head. Therfore he that throughlye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth, that he is borne of god, taketh more hede that he doe no euyl, than of deathe it ſelfe: and kepeth hymſelfe that he haue nothynge a doe with that naughtie lorde (<hi>deuill</hi>) whom he ſerued before together with the worlde. Lyke as Chriſte beynge once dead roſe agayne to lyfe, and roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne to lyfe neuer to dye any more: euen ſo he that throughe baptiſme is once dead vnto the worlde, and riſen againe to newnes of lyfe with Chriſt, it is not mete for hym to doe that thynge agayne, for the whyche Chriſte muſt dye agayne. Let them be affrayed of the worlde, whiche are not true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly borne againe of god: which haue not with al the pith of their whole hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes receyued the ſeede of the goſpelles doctrine. We knowe, that wee are truely of god, whome neyther the euyll thynges nor the good thynges of thys world can ſeperate from Chriſte. The whole world is ſet all together on naughtines. Whiche waye ſoeuer a man turneth hym, there is occaſion offred of thynges to turne vs awaye quite from the innocent vpryghtnes of lyfe. But from the worldes enchauntmentes the ſonne of god hathe once delyuered vs: whiche came into the worlde for thys cauſe, to exempte vs out of the contagious infeccion of the worlde. He hathe dryuen awaye the darkenes of oure former ignoraunce, and hathe geuen vs an vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng that is lyghtened with the lyght of the goſpell: to thintent we ſhould knowe the true god &amp; the free geuer of al righteouſnes: who onely had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng a doe with the worlde: and we are in hym truely, in that we folowe hys doctrine and promyſes with an vpryght conſcience, as longe as wee are in hys ſonne Ieſus Chriſte, whome he ſent into the worlde for that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. He is the true god, whiche onely ought to be honoured: and the true lyfe, whiche onelye oughte to bee deſyred. Lytell chyldren, yf you doo true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye knowe the true God, beware of falſe goddes, and vayne Images, whyche the worlde hathe in honoure.

With vs ſhall be grace, mercie, and peace from god the father, and from the Lorde Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of the father, in trueth &amp; loue. I reioyſed greatly, that I founde of thy children walkynge in trueth, as we haue receaued a commaundement of the father. And now beſeche I thee lady, not as thoughe I wrote a newe commaundement vnto the, but that ſame which we haue had from the beginninge, that we ſhould loue one another. And this is the loue, that we ſhould walke after his commaundement. This co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement is (that as ye haue heard from the begynning) ye ſhould walke init.

<pb facs="tcp:7459:342"/>
you haue already receaued longe a goe, and not to ſuffre youre ſelues by any ſubtilties of the falſe prophetes to be plucked awaye. For in dede there are manye deceauers in the worlde, whiche denye that Ieſus is Chriſte, whiche ſhoulde come into the worlde accordinge to the prophetes prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienges.

Whiche brethren if thou brynge forwardes of theyr iourney (after a godly ſorte) thou ſhalt do well, becauſe that for hys names ſake they went forth: and toke nothinge of the Gentyls. We therfore ought to receaue ſuch, that we myght be helpers to the trueth. I wrote vnto the congregacyon: but Diotrephes, whiche loueth to haue the preemynence among them, receyueth vs not. Wherfore if I come, I will declare hys dedes whiche he doeth, ieſtynge on vs with malycious wordes, nether is therwith content.

Demetrius hath good reporte of all men, and of the trueth it ſelfe, yea, and we oure ſelues alſo beare recorde, and ye know, that oure recorde is true.

For the accuſer of oure brethren is  caſte downe, whiche accuſed them before our God daie and night.

The ſeconde is the beaſte at Rome, of whome we ſpake before, the very right Antichriſt, whiche ſpeaketh and worketh all that he can againſt the goſpell of Ieſus Chriſte, wherunto he preferreth his decretalles, and wyll be Lorde ouer

And they woulde nothing regarde nor eſteme the holy worde of God, which was geuen vnto the worlde in the holy ſcripture for a perfyte rule and ſquare: but they would neuer credyte nor beleue it, but raſhly againſt their owne conſcience haue refuſed and contemned it.

This iudgement and heuy daye ſhall no man be able to eſcape and auoyde, whether he be conſumed in the earth, in the fyre or in the ſee.

For in the ſtate of bliſſe and ſaluacion, is no thought nor ſorowe to be taken for any of theſe thinges. For the firſt and originall occaſion of all theſe miſeries (the ſynne of Adam and Eue for whoſe ſake the worlde was created,) is altogether paſt, and vtterly ceaſed, ended and finyſhed together with death and the deuyll, thorowe the rightuouſnes of our ſauiour Chriſt. Thorowe the whiche rightuouſnes all mankynde, ſo many as are faithful, is reconciled vnto God for euermore. Thus hath Chriſt ſyttyng vpon the ſtoole of his kyngdom and glorye, ordeyned all thinges newe. This muſt be ſtedfaſtlye confeſſed and beleued of all faithfull chriſtians, as an infallyble trueth, &amp; therfore it is gods commaundement that it ſhoulde be wrytten for an euerlaſting remembraunce, for an holſome doctrine and conſolacion, that all men ſhould beleue the trueth, and ſo beleuynge obteyne bliſſe and ſaluacion.

Vnto all them which in this vale of myſery dyd thirſt after rightuouſnes and after the glory of god, vnto them wyll the grace and fauorable mercye of God gyue the liuing wel and fountayne of all goodnes, and the eternal ſpringynge floode of refreſhment vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſaluacion, and to perpetuall ioy and felicitie in God.

And where as the Apoſtles are here more named than the prophetes, it is done for this purpoſe, for as much as thorow the Apoſtles the doctrine of the prophetes, and the goſpell promyſed in the prophetes was ſpredde abrode and publyſhed in the whoſe wyde worlde: whiche goſpell the prophetes dyd preache and wryte onely vnto the children of Iſrael, and to their neighbours the people nexte about them of the lande of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell, and againe becauſe the apoſtles were witneſſes in their owne parſons of the ſlaying and death of the lambe.</p>

For the holy chriſten faithe, was preached by this holy mans S. Iohns tyme, and grew, and increaſed in al lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and nacions of the whole earth.

And I knowe alſo and am aſſured that this angell was an holy angell, and therfore I, for feare and reuerence, woulde haue worſhipped him as a ſeruaunt and miniſter of God, and I dyd alſo worſhip him, and fell downe at his feete to worſhip him, that I might ſeme to ſhewe thankefulnes vnto him for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite benefite and grace, that he reueled and opened vnto me ſuche highe and holy ſecrete miſteries.

And althoughe the nature and dignitie of angels be higher than the ſtate and dignite of man, yet by the reaſon of the manhode of Chriſt, and by the reaſon of the ſaluacion of mankynde thorowe Chriſt, the nature of man is exalted aboue all angels. And therfore from hence forthe the angell wyll not be hygher eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med than as a felowe ſeruaunt of all men vnto the lorde.
