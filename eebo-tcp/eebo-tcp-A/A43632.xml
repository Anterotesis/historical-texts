         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YEſterday came to my hand the ſaid <hi>Libel</hi> (ſo I call it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe) it is throughout falſe and ſlanderous, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Name, no, not ſo much as of the Bookſeller or Printer, that durſt Print or vend ſuch a venemous Pamphlet.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, I have ſeen many a private Letter written to him, but without any Name ſubſcribed, ſince the publiſhing of—<hi>Curſe ye</hi> Meroz.— One threatens he ſhall be ſtab'd; another ſays, he wonder the Biſhops do not pull his Gown off his Back, he is ſuch a <hi>Common-ſwearer, Common-drunkard, Common-Barrater,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Debauchee;</hi> another threatens, that the Sermon ſhall be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered very ſpeedily in Print; and then he ſhall ſee, how pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly they would make a very Rogue of him, and prove he was a Rebel againſt K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. But that the miſchief on't is, K. <hi>Charles</hi> was Beheaded before Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi> was 16 years old. And to compleat his miſery, yeſterday he received a Letter, that begun (with a witty <hi>Anagram</hi> upon his name) thus, Mr. <hi>Hickeringill. Anagr.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hectoring Devil.</hi> So mad they are, you ſee, that they throw their very Brains as well Gall at him. All which I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to conceal from you that loves him ſo dearly, and to beg of you, that as you love your ſelf, your Life, your Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (or which is deareſt to you) your Reputation, take warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi>'s Fate, and never dare to Print or Preach againſt Fanaticks; for they are old Dog at Lying and Slander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Murthering, and wounding Reputation.</p>
            <p>Indeed, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>Anſwer not a Fool according to his Folly, leſt thou alſo be like unto him;</hi> that is, leſt thou be accounted, by taking notice of his Folly, as fooliſh and impertinent as he.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98367:3"/>And yet in the very next verſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.5. as if upon ſecond thoughts, he had chang'd his Opinion, he gives quite contrary Advice, ſaying, <hi>Anſwer a Fooll according to his Folly, leſt he be wiſe in his own Eyes;</hi> leſt he plume himſelf (like this Obſervator) Crow and Strut, as if he was unanſwerable and uncontroulable, in reviling a Sermon that has carefully aſſerted his Majeſties Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, and the Parliament and Peoples Properties and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, Holy <hi>David</hi> knew not any Remedy for a ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and venemous Tongue; <hi>What ſhall be given thee, and what ſhall be done unto thee? Oh, thou falſe Tongue!</hi> There is no ſuch Antidote againſt the Poyſon of Aſps and Vipers, as their own Fleſh, they carry about them their <hi>Alexipharmacon;</hi> and all the Remedy that I ſhall make uſe of at preſent againſt this <hi>viperous</hi> Libeller, <hi>(the poyſon of Aſps being under his Lips)</hi> is only taken out of the Body of the Libel it ſelf, and ſhew the Falſhood of thoſe Scandals, by their own Incongruity and Inconſiſtency.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Obſervator</hi> (ſo I'le call him, as he calls himſelf) ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the dark at Mens Reputations, and wounding them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Fear, (as well as without Controul) inſtead of making Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations upon the ſaid <hi>Sermon,</hi> ſays not one word that is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant in <hi>Anſwer,</hi> or to <hi>confute the ſame;</hi> but according to the <hi>wonted</hi> Attacques of ſuch Adverſaries, <hi>falls foul</hi> upon the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſhaking hands with the Argument, lets drive at Mr. <hi>Hickeringill,</hi> when he has firſt aſpers'd him with his ſmutty Ink.</p>
            <p>And becauſe he knew Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Converſation to be ſo innocent and unblamealble, that nothing but Malice and Falſhood conjoyn'd, can vilifie him, therefore he dare not ſay, but yet makes a wild and impertinent Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, <hi>p.</hi> 7. of a <hi>Graceleſs Villain,</hi> inſinuating ſlily, that Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi> was that ſame Graceleſs Villain; but leſt he ſhould be taken by the Beard for it, with — <hi>What do you mean, Sir?</hi> He preſently cries <hi>peceavi,</hi> and Oh Lord, Sir! I beg your Pardon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For when he has made his Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of that ſame Graceleſs Villain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> immediately he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns — <q>
                  <hi>But what is all this to our Sermon? Nothing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98367:3"/>at all I hope; but why may not a man be impertinent now and then?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>So that I ſay, all the Venome of the ſaid Libel, may be heal'd by it's own ſelf, its own <hi>confeſſed Impertinence</hi> and Incongruity.</p>
            <p>But leſt the <hi>Obſervator</hi> ſhould be wiſe in his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and puffed up, as thinking and hoping that Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi> and his Friends will ſcorn to anſwer ſuch a <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fler,</hi> (for he that throws a ſtone at every bawling Curr, ſhall have work enough) and alſo becauſe the Author of the ſaid Sermon (Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi>) is ſo unblameable in his Life and Converſation, that this Libeller is the firſt that ever durſt Print (whatever they might mutter behind his Back) any thing againſt the Uprightneſs and Integrity of his Life. Therefore I (that have (as well as you) been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately acquainted with him above thirty years) thought it my Duty as well as Honour, thus to make his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.</p>
            <p>Some Paſſages of the ſaid Sermon, the <hi>Obſervator</hi> does indeed Re-print, but confutes not one word thereof, except by telling an apparent Falſhood <hi>pag.</hi> 5. concerning <hi>Deborah,</hi> who (he ſays) was no Sovereign over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, (and he might with equal Truth ſay it) <hi>David</hi> was no Sovereign over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but a Prophet, and <hi>Solomon</hi> was no Sovereign over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but a Preacher. The man flings, and kicks, and rails as if he was gaul'd and wounded, and by that therefore he muſt be either a Papiſt or a Fanatick, for no other are aggriev'd at that innocent Sermon, and plain and honeſt Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Text; or elſe the <hi>Obſervator</hi> is ſome envious and malicious Scribler, whoſe Spleen as well as Gall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flows.</p>
            <p>And I am apt to think he is one of this laſt Character, by the Care he takes to blaſt the Reputation of the Author, as appears by ſuch Expreſſions as theſe: (<hi>p.</hi> 5.) This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98367:4"/>would engroſs the Glory (and to the Prejudice of all his Brethren too;) and <hi>p.</hi> 4. There are many honeſt Divines (without Neceſſity of including this Gentleman) who are as active Preachers up of Loyalty.</p>
            <p>So that the fear leſt Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi> ſhould get a Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly to be the Loyal-Preacher, and the Sermon on—<hi>Curſe ye</hi> Meroz—a None-ſuch, and ſo engroſs all the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (and to the Prejudice of all his Brethren too) whilſt they (good men, if they could tell how) are as active Preachers up of Loyalty. This, this made the Obſervator in haſt call for Pen and Ink, and reſolve before People have given in their Verdicts, and before the Term be done, to make Obſervations enough upon it, to brand it, as guilty, guilty of engroſſing the Glory (and to the Prejudice of his Brethren too,) who are as active Preachers up of Loyalty. And therefore reſolv'd to write ſomething if he could, true or falſe, to leſſen the Reputation of the Sermon, and its Author.</p>
            <p>If I be not much miſtaken in this ſame Obſervator, this ſame—As active a Preacher of Loyalty, was in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Time, as active a Preacher up of <hi>Oliver,</hi> and during all the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Viciſſitudes and Changes of Government, kept his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, and in the <hi>Rump's</hi> time was a <hi>Rumper;</hi> in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s time for <hi>Oliver;</hi> in Queen <hi>Dicks</hi> time for <hi>Richard;</hi> and in the Committee of <hi>Slavery</hi>'s Time for them, and in the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Reſtauration and Reign of his Majeſty, he takes it in Dudgeon, that any man ſhould engroſs the Glory of a more Loyal Preacher, than this ſame will for the King.</p>
            <p>He makes me think of the Story Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi> tells of the Vicar of <hi>Bray,</hi> that in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's days was a Papiſt, in <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's Reign a Proteſtant, in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Time a Papiſt, and in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Time a Proteſtant again; of all which, when his Pariſhioners complain'd to him, for making them (and that from the ſame Pulpit and the ſame Throat) with ſeveral Notes and Tones dance <hi>in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98367:4"/>and out</hi> in the Church, as if they were (in Religion too) dancing the <hi>Hay;</hi> he anſwered, good People, whatever were the <hi>Premiſes,</hi> I always did and will hold me to this Concluſion, To live and dye <hi>Vicar of</hi> Bray.</p>
            <p>Such another <hi>Mercury</hi> is (and has been) our Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; with the Fanaticks he'l ſnivle and groan, with the Church of <hi>England</hi> he is as 'piſcopal and as active a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er up of Loyalty, as the beſt of them: and rather than not be the Fore-horſe, he will with Envy burſt his Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, though he thereby make himſelf the Fore-aſs.</p>
            <p>Yes, yes, 'tis he indeed—now I look better at him, 'tis he, that ſame Vicar of <hi>Bray,</hi> (but I ſpare his name, tho' perhaps I'll pull him out of his lurking-hole e're it be long) I know him by the ſame old, inſipid, phlegmatickſtyle, the ſame old Suppoſals, Dilemma's, and venturing-pins, 'tis ſome ſneaking, peeviſh, envious, and ſpightful Black-coat, (and where ſhall a man find leſs good Nature, more envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſlandering or undermining of one another, greater Make-bates than are ſome of them, or—as the Sermon has it, tell me of any Miſchief, Tumults, or Rebellion, that ſome of theſe ſame Black-coats have not had a great hand in,) ſuch as think they can never look fair except they make a black-patch of others, eſpecially of their next Neighbours, or ſuch as are near them; and though ſuch ſneaking Raſcals never meddle but to their own Shame, yet their Envy prompts them on to lying and ſlandering, tho' in Concluſion they always meddle to their Hurt.</p>
            <p>And as they are the worſt natur'd men, ſo certainly the moſt dangerous to the Peace and Quiet of Mankind, they are always finding Fault with others, deſpiſing others, railing at others, undermining other mens good name, leſt they ſhould ſhine to eclipſe and benight their twinckling Puny-ſhips, conſcious of their own Baſeneſs and Demerit; like the poor Levellers, they would pull down their Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and render them (if they could by any baſe ways,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98367:5"/>falſe News and lying Pamphlets) as low, that is, as baſe as themſelves.</p>
            <p>But all their Attacques are ſneaking and cowardly, clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine and in the dark, ſtill robbing men of their good Names with a Vizard on, for fear of due Chaſtiſement and Diſcovery, for fear (not of being belyed and ſlander'd, the only Weapons with which all the Antagoniſts can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi>) but for fear of being expos'd in his own Colours, and then he would look as black as <hi>Vulcan</hi> himſelf, (or which I dare ſay he is) the Son of a Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith; That ſneak't into the Univerſity by lacqueying it to a Gentleman, that got a Degree and a Fellowſhip by his Dexterity in making (clean) his Tutors Shoos, and Coal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires, that always thrive by Flattery only, baſe-complyance, and ſupplanting other men; and therefore ſince he is ſuch a Littany-man, I'll joyn in Prayer with him with ſome Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and conclude him, as he does his lying Pamphlet, with the ſame or the like Petitions—From the Kilne that calls the Mill burnt-Arſe; from all drunken, debaucht, and envious Black-coats; from undermining and ſupplanting Raſcals, and graceleſs Villains; from Lyers and Slanderers, and the Vicar of <hi>Bray;</hi> from Pulpit-Fools, as well as Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit-Enthuſiaſts—deliver us—and let all good Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <q>And ſo the Notes of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bible (but <hi>E. H.</hi> has declared

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>She judged Iſrael,</hi> — that is, ſaith the Margin, <hi>by the Spirit of Prophecy.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I know not what <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Geneva</hi> Bible the <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator</hi> has got for his turn, but (except himſelf) no man, I dare ſay, did ever ſee ſuch a Margin in the Bible, whether <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Latine, Greek</hi> or <hi>Hebrew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no Marginal Notes to <hi>Judg.</hi> 4.4. but the Words are theſe, <hi>And Deborah a Propheteſs, the Wife of Lapidoth, ſhe judged Iſrael at that time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh! but <hi>ſhe had an extraordinary Call thereunto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not ſo extraordinary (it ſeems) but <hi>Barak</hi> durſt talk ſawcily, or rather familiarly to her; But worſe men than <hi>Barak</hi> did, not onely talk ſawcily, but act ſcurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and diſloyally, as curſed <hi>Meroz,</hi> in the ſaid Text; yet not ſo ſawcily and ſcurvily, as Rebels in our times have both talk't and acted againſt their Sovereigns.</p>
            <p>Nor more extraordinary was her Call to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, than was all other the Judges in thoſe dayes; <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> and <hi>Gideon, Jephthah</hi> and <hi>Sampſon, Samuel, Saul,</hi> and <hi>David;</hi> for none of them had it by Succeſſion, but by ſpecial Appointment.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:98367:6"/>
            <p>Now, except the <hi>Obſervator</hi> means, that no Subjects are bound to aid their Sovereigns, except their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns have an extraordinary Call; (no which extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Call of <hi>Deborah</hi> does appear in the Text) and which ſeems to be the conſequence of his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, I cannot <hi>Divine</hi> what he would be at, but ſure he might as pertinently turn <hi>Augur,</hi> and <hi>obſerve</hi> the flying of Birds, as <hi>obſerve</hi> at this extravagant rate.</p>
            <p>Beſides, To abuſe the Reader with an untruth, (in alledging <hi>Marginal Notes</hi> that were never heard of,) is not the firſt he has told, as I will ſhew by and by.</p>
            <p>But the firſt Cavil he makes, is againſt the Author's Veracity and Memory, becauſe he ſayes — That this <hi>Text was never before inſiſted on by him at any time:</hi> 
               <q>yet notwithſtanding he finds a Sermon made of it by the ſame Author in <hi>Gregory Father Gray-beard,</hi> three or four Octavo pages long:</q> which is an Inſtance that the man was reſolv'd to find fault right or wrong, or otherwiſe he had not at the beginning tyr'd upon ſo impertinent a Quarry, that he can get ſo little by, except ſhame and contempt by all inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous men. Does the <hi>Obſervator</hi> think <hi>indeed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed</hi> that that was a Sermon? and ever preach't in any Pulpit by Mr. <hi>Hickeringill?</hi> which he confeſſes was onely a little Ryme Burleſque? But ſuch a Trifler is not worth the anſwering, no more than his <hi>Cavil</hi> againſt thoſe fix Verſes in <hi>Greg.</hi> which a far better, but as immodeſt a Pen as his, anſwered onely, as he does, by giving it as he does (an ill Name) Ryme Dogge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel: namely,

            <p>He is a Stranger in <hi>England</hi> that does not know that <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Fanaticks, Atheiſts</hi> and <hi>Debauchee</hi>'s are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſiderable Parties in the Kingdom; now if no man can be any of theſe, if he obſerves <hi>thoſe ſix</hi> verſes, they are certainly the moſt uſeful Rymes doggerel that ever were made. Another Untruth we meet with <hi>p.</hi> 4. where the <hi>Obſervator</hi> alledges out of the ſaid Sermon—<q>That the <hi>moſt Loyal Text in all the Bible, is now (like a piece of Apocrypha) laid aſide, antiquated and out of Date;</hi> which he calls an odd, indeed a ſawcy Reflection on ;all the Loyal Clergy in <hi>England.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This lying Libeller ſays ſo, but there is no ſuch Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the whole Sermon: there is indeed a <hi>quaere</hi> in the ſaid Sermon in theſe words—<hi>ſhall this Text now (like a piece of Apocrypha) be laid aſide, antiquated and out of Date?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not aſſerting it is ſo, but querying whether it be not ſo? which, whether it be not a very inoffenſive <hi>Quaere?</hi> and whether the ſaid Text be not very ſeldome (if at all) inſiſted upon in theſe times, I leave to you the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Reader to judge, craving your Pardon that I ſhould vouchſafe to trouble you with pointing at Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes in this ſame thick-skull'd <hi>Obſervator,</hi> that to every vulgar Capacity are ſo obvious, and readily diſcern'd without this <hi>Index.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I muſt either mind ſuch Untruths or nothing in the whole Libel; for it is but one continued and ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Lye and Slander, a whole Sheet full; from one end to the other.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:98367:7"/>
            <p>And therefore I ſhall take notice of no more, but that for which the whole <hi>Pamphlet</hi> ſeems to be writ, and that is to caſt an Aſperſion, very <hi>ſlyly</hi> though, and by way of <hi>Suppoſal,</hi> which yet he recants, and retracts immediately, his own Conſcience (if he have any) telling him that it is (as he acknowledges) <hi>impertinent,</hi> and no more to the Reverend man (as he ſtyles) the Author in his firſt Line, than to the man in the Moon.</p>
            <p>Yet <hi>p.</hi> 7. we are entertain'd, (as indeed all the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments in the whole Pamphlet, and all the Truths therein, are only the Expreſſions he Re-prints out of the ſaid Sermon) as in theſe Words—</p>
            <q>
               <p>But above all that Paſſage <hi>p.</hi> 26. <hi>(namely of the Sermon)</hi> is remarkable—<hi>A Holder-forth may yawl and yawn, ſnivle and whine, thump and bawl, 'till his Lungs and his Heart ake, and yet neither make open-hearted nor open-handed their cloſe-fiſted Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; nay, he ſhall turn up the white of his Eye, and play as many Tricks as</hi> Hocus Pocus <hi>at a Fair, and yet not get ſo much Money at Night as a common and prophane</hi> Hocus— This well conſider'd as a moſt enlightning Paragraph; are things thus indeed? Well, Suppoſe then there were ever a graceleſs Villain in a Country, that had firſt cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin'd his Tutor of a Fellowſhip, by gobling up the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant himſelf, whilſt he perſwaded the old man, there was Rats-bane in it, that had renounced his Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and been publickly dipt in hopes to thrive among the Anabaptiſts, that had liſted himſelf in the Rebbels Army; and both preach't and fought againſt his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, that had-afterwards got a Shipboard, and even there kik't for fear of debauching the <hi>Tarpaulins;</hi> after all theſe Diſappointments, and trading being ſo horrible dull amongſt the Conventiclers, do you imagine ſuch a Fool would not think it high time to change Note and Coat, if it were poſſible to get into ſome fatter
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98367:7"/>Paſtures, and rave and rant to the purpoſe, to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of? Yes marry would he, and kiſs the Maſs-Book moſt reverently I'le warrant him, if there were any thing to be got by it.</p>
               <p>But what is all this to our Sermon? Nothing at all, I hope; But why may not a man be impertinent now and then?</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Pretty heart!</hi> take breath after all this impertinence.</p>
            <p>But if he means (or elſe he means nothing by this Impertinence) to reflect upon, or calumniate the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Sermon on — <hi>Curſe ye Meroz;</hi> I'le give this plain and true, ſhort and yet full Narrative of Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi>'s Life; which had been as needleſs, as fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and impertinent, as his idle Suppoſal, if the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator's Impudence and falſhood had not given this juſt Provocation, and occaſion to this Vindication.</p>
            <p>I have known Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi> ſince firſt he came to the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where he was admitted <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner</hi> in <hi>St. John</hi>'s Colledge at fourteen years of Age; he got not, nor poſſibly could get his <hi>Tutor</hi>'s <hi>Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> for he was made Fellow of <hi>Gonvile</hi> and <hi>Cajus</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, when he was eighteen years of Age, and <hi>junior</hi> Batchelor, <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1650. He never ſwallowed nor gobled up the Covenant in his Life, not but that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he might have had ſtomach enough to it, but it was <hi>off</hi> the Stage before he came <hi>on;</hi> yet both he and the whole Univerſity were (ſufficiently) of Fanatical, Rebellious, Anabaptiſtical and Factious Principles and Practiſes, as all men living are (in their Infancy) of that Religion alone in which they are educated; and he <hi>when he was a child, did as a child,</hi> nay, as wiſer men than he did; and if he had been educated at <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in the National Religion <hi>there</hi> profeſs'd,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98367:8"/>he had alſo certainly been a <hi>Papiſt</hi> or <hi>Mahometan</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Miracle.</p>
            <p>Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> by Education became a Jewiſh zealot; <hi>Luther, Calvin, Beza,</hi> and our Fore-fathers, all Papiſts: upon better Information they became Proteſtants, as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> a Chriſtian: The Devil and Devilliſh men rag'd, and call'd them Apoſtates, but the Saints ſaid, <hi>He that perſecuted us in times paſt, now preacheth the Goſpel, and they glorified God in me,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul;</hi> they did not rail, rage, upbraid, and calumniate, as Devilliſh men do: The Strength, the Spirit and Activity (with which God and Nature had bleſt Mr. <hi>Hickeringill,</hi> inclin'd him to a <hi>Military,</hi> rather than a <hi>Colledge</hi>-life; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore viſiting the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, (and ſome of his neareſt Relations) in <hi>Scotland,</hi> firſt accepted of a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> to be a Lieutenant; but after ſome few years he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to ſee the Wars in Foreign Countreys, none where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was then ſo famous, as the Wars of <hi>Carolus Guſtavus,</hi> King of <hi>Swede,</hi> whoſe Fame perſwaded him to accept a Captains Commiſſion in Major-General <hi>Fleetwood</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, then <hi>Swediſh</hi> Ambaſſador in <hi>England:</hi> carrying ſix ſcore brave <hi>Engliſh</hi>-men to the <hi>Swede's</hi> Service; where he continued till the Peace concluded between the <hi>Swede</hi> and <hi>Dane,</hi> when he return'd to his Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> where he rais'd his Company, and ſoon after was Captain of a Troop of Volunteer-Horſe that riſe under the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> and Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi> declaring for a <hi>Free-Parliament,</hi> the happy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue to His Majeſties Reſtauration. After that, he had the Command of a <hi>Man of War</hi> under the King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> as he formerly had been Commander of the <hi>North-Star,</hi> a <hi>Man of War,</hi> under the <hi>Swedes</hi> King; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, his deſire of Travel, and ſeeing Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, made him viſit the <hi>Indies, Surinam, Barbadoes,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:98367:8"/>St. <hi>Chriſtophers, Jamaica,</hi> &amp;c. from which laſt-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Iſland, he brought the Governour <hi>Doyly</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to His Majeſty and Duke of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> with a <hi>Map</hi> of the Countrey, and <hi>Deſcription</hi> of that Iſland, which he Printed and dedicated to his Majeſty. And having rambled enough, (by the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> Dr. <hi>Saunderſon</hi>) he was both perſwaded to be (and made) a Prieſt, and his firſt Preferment eighteen years ago (was what he now enjoys) the Rectory of <hi>All Saints</hi> in <hi>Colcheſter;</hi> a place that perhaps has more than any other exerciſed his Patience, and other Virtues; they that know Fanaticks, <hi>they that know the men and their Communication,</hi> muſt believe that a man of his Integrity, Loyalty, and plain dealing muſt meet with Calumnies and Oppoſition enough; he was indicted for a <hi>Common-ſwearer,</hi> and perhaps may be indicted for a Common-Barretor, and what not? But for a <hi>Common-ſwearer</hi> he ſtands now <hi>convict</hi> in the High-Court of <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,</hi> and <hi>That never a word comes out of his Mouth, but an Oath comes out,</hi> atteſted and ſworn by three <hi>Colcheſter</hi> men; and yet it is as certain and commonly known for an undoubted Truth, that he never ſwore a raſh Oath in all his Life time, or ever took the Sacred name of God in vain, which ſcarce one man in <hi>Colcheſter</hi> can ſay, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept himſelf, and yet he is the <hi>only man</hi> that ſtands <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed</hi> as aforeſaid for a <hi>Common-ſwearer;</hi> but 'tis his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Innocence, <hi>the moſt ſacred Innocence</hi> and Integrity is no Fence or Skreen againſt Malice. But that he ſhould by <hi>Flattery</hi> or baſer means hunt after Preferment, is ſo ſenceleſs a Calumny againſt the Plainneſs and Auſterity of his Converſation, (even unto Moroſity,) (as ſome conſtrue it) is a Suppoſal ſo ridiculouſly ſuggeſted, that none can believe it that knows him; and that <hi>large and plentiful</hi> Temporal Eſtate of <hi>Inheritance,</hi> that God has
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98367:9"/>bleſt him with above all or any of his Neighbour-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; and how ſmilingly, careleſs, and unconcern'd he is at the fooliſh and malicious Attempts of his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which hitherto has always ended in their own Shame and Confuſion. And why may not a man that was a Souldier in his juvenile years, accept of an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Office, and be a Clergyman in his graver Hours, and when he has ſown his wild Oats, rather than bring them up into the Pulpit with him?</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was firſt Governour, then Biſhop of the ſame City; St. <hi>Peter</hi> was a Fiſherman and then a <hi>Divine,</hi> and after that followed the old Fiſhing trade ſtill. St. <hi>Paul</hi> was a Weaver and a Taylor, (for a Tent-maker im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed both theſe Trades) and then a Divine; and whilſt he was ſo, he ſometimes fell to his Needle and Shuttle again.</p>
            <p>Here's a Doe with what men have been; certainly, if every mans Faults were expoſed and writ in their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, few men would look with any better Complecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than this ſo ſlander'd Author. And certainly, if Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi> had ſtill been a Fanatick, he had been cry'd up as much for a <hi>precious godly Man,</hi> as any <hi>Spiritual Pick-pocket</hi> amongſt the Crew; and as much as the <hi>Noyſe-Makers</hi> now cry him down for a Villain.</p>
            <p>Methinks I ſee how zealouſly and devoutly thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Juglers rate and ſet on their ſilly Votaries to bawl and bark againſt the Author of that Sermon, that diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and bewrays <hi>the Craft by which they get their Wealth,</hi> when they ſee that almoſt the <hi>Hopes of their Gain is gone.</hi> And if his Sermon and Comment on that <hi>darling</hi> Text of <hi>Curſe ye</hi> Meroz—which has done ſuch Feats, had been <hi>Stylo vetere,</hi> interpreted againſt all <hi>Sence, Reaſon, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> or the <hi>Context,</hi> not a Conventicle in the Nation, but by this time had made Bonfires for Joy of that,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98367:9"/>which (as now it is) they would gladly make a Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire on, and another of him, if they had their Wills. But let them proceed as far and as faſt as their <hi>old Father</hi> drives them, <hi>He that ſitteth in the Heavens ſhall laugh them to ſcorn, the Lord ſhall have them in deriſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor could they readily have had a man to be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Fanatick-wrath, who is more cheerfully Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of Proof (by long and large Experience) againſt it, than he: for the more they have rag'd and ray'ld, ſlander'd and calumniated, fretted and fum'd, Almighty God has bleſt him the more with Mercies both of the right hand and the left, having given him ſo many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and promiſing Heirs for his Eſtate, and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and plentiful an Eſtate for his Heirs; whilſt his Adverſaries grin and rail, ſnarl and ſhew their Teeth, and pine away.</p>
            <p>In a little time it will be no <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> that <hi>Truth is ſtrongeſt,</hi> and no <hi>weapon formed againſt it ſhall proſper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed the ſilly <hi>Obſervator</hi> nibbles, p. 6. at that Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in the Sermon, p. 17. (namely) <hi>That all men's Faith muſt bottom upon ſome Humane Authority or other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sermon does not aſſert, that the <hi>Top</hi> and bottom of all men's Faith is Humane Authority; for the <hi>Top</hi> of a man's Faith is the <hi>Grace of God.</hi> So p. 19. of — <hi>Curſe ye Meroz</hi> — you find theſe words—<hi>Through the Grace of God enabling us to believe, what ſuch good men and true did depoſe upon their own knawledge; Faith is the Life of a Chriſtian,</hi> &amp;c. And p. 17. <hi>All true Faith is the Gift of God, as all other Gifts and Graces are, for without Gods ſpecial Grace no man can believe the trueſt Humane Authority or Church upon Earth to be true.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now where was the <hi>Obſervator</hi>'s Eyes that he could not ſee thoſe Paſſages of the Sermon, and where was his Honeſty to expoſe ſome bit of the Sermon, without what
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98367:10"/>went before and after; and then too not to have one word to ſay by way of Anſwer, but onely holding up his hands, and falling to his Prayers, and <hi>wiſhes that the Parliament might ſit as ſoon as may be, to authorize the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by an Act, and furniſh People with Bottoms of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Obſervator was not very illiterate in the Laws of the Land, he might find Acts of Parliament enow, (before he was born, and almoſt as old as <hi>Paul</hi>'s, for <hi>England</hi> was the firſt Chriſtian-Kingdom) to make the Bible <hi>Canonical,</hi> and to furniſh People with <hi>bottoms of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For though the Holy Bible was and is the Word of God, though never a King or Parliament had told us ſo, yet it does not become <hi>Canonical,</hi> (that is, a <hi>Canon,</hi> or Law to Subjects) till it be commanded by Lawful Authority; and therefore our Holy Bible is not onely the Word of God, and ſo Sacred, but alſo the Law of the Land, and ſo Canonical; and all the Laws of the Land, lawfully made, and by lawful Authority, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Laws of God, to which we ought to ſubmit, <hi>not only for wrath, but alſo for conſcience-ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then where would there be place for Mutinies and Rebellions, for the Spirit of Popery or spirit of Foppery? This makes that Devil rage at Mr. <hi>Hicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingill,</hi> having <hi>great wrath,</hi> becauſe <hi>his time is ſhort:</hi> but to attacque or anſwer him or his Sermon only with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, Lyes, and Slanders. Is this <hi>Scholar-like, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian-like?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truth is Truth, whoever proclaims it, and 'tis a baſe Requital of Ingenuous men, onely to load them with falſe Invectives, and Hatred inſtead of good Will; ſuch Returns will make men of more than Vulgar Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Attainments, ſay, with the Popiſh Cardinal, —<hi>Si Populus vult decipi, decipiatur:</hi> If the People have
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98367:10"/>a mind to be blockiſh, ſo let them continue, for all me.</p>
            <p>Yet the <hi>Obſervator</hi> ſeems to be in great trouble of mind that the Sermon ſhould <hi>p.</hi> 38. call the <hi>Engliſh (the moſt Generous and ingenuous Nation</hi> (ah, Sycophant!) <hi>in the world) the blockiſh</hi> Engliſh.</p>
            <p>Was it not <hi>greatly done</hi> of our <hi>little Obſerver,</hi> to reflect ſo ſeverely upon that innocent Paſſage in the Sermon — <hi>The moſt loyal Text in all the Bible.</hi> Whereupon he very gravely obſerves, p. 4. in theſe words — <hi>Compariſons are generally odious, eſpecially when between things incomparable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why? Are they ſo indeed, Beloved? Some of the <hi>blockiſh Engliſh</hi> (that are not ſo concern'd to leſſen the Reputation of the Author or his Sermon,) would have paſt by ſo innocent a Paſſage, and never have <hi>knit their brows at it,</hi> nor yet have mark'd it with ſo ſharp-pointed an <hi>Aſteriſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whil'ſt you live, <hi>look to your hits,</hi> and place your words in order, when you come <hi>within ken</hi> of a little <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such a Fool was I, that I had thought a man might be very innocent, though he had ſaid (by way of compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) more Spiritual knowledge and comfort is to be had from the New Teſtament than the Old, and from ſome Texts and Verſes therein than from other, and from the latter end of the firſt Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> than from the middle or beginning, and yet the Holy Bible is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable (that is) above all other Books, but not when compar'd within its ſelf. I never, till now, knew where or how much St. <hi>Paul</hi> was a Sinner, and to be blam'd (by the <hi>Obſervator</hi>) for ſaying — (I thought harmleſly) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. <hi>I labour'd more abundantly than they all:</hi> namely, <hi>All</hi> the Apoſtles.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:98367:11"/>
            <p>Happy St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that never met with ſuch an <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> amongſt all the <hi>Corinthians!</hi> that had a Deſign to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the Reputation of him and his Writings; if he had, how might they have deſcanted upon him, in the words of our Obſervator—<hi>Compariſons</hi> (Paul) <hi>are generally odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, eſpecially when between things incomparable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were very <hi>blockiſh Corinthians,</hi> that could not ſpy faults, at leaſt, not ſo ill-natur'd and malicious as our <hi>Obſervator,</hi> and willing to ſpy faults, and expoſe them, to leſſen mens Reputation: or elſe our <hi>Obſervator</hi> is as <hi>blockiſh</hi> as <hi>envious,</hi> to make ſuch ſevere. Obſervations upon ſo innocent an Expreſſion; and more blockiſh to imagine, that any of the <hi>Generous and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Engliſh</hi> can be ſuch <hi>blockiſh Engliſh</hi> as not to ſee that, whilſt the Obſervator is ſo trivially and keenly buſie to leſſen the Reputation of Mr. <hi>Hickeringil.</hi> He has onely thereby leſſen'd his own (if ever he had any) amongſt the <hi>generous and ingenuous</hi> Engliſh, at leaſt.</p>
            <p>This Trifler is, (I ſay) like <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Planets, good with the good, and bad with the bad; ſometimes he cokes's the Clergy, ſometimes the Fanaticks, as <hi>p.</hi> 7. becauſe Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi> ſayes, p. 23. <hi>If there was not a Papiſt in</hi> England, <hi>yet they would fright the People with fears of</hi> Popery.—</p>
            <p>Now, for my part, ſuch a plain blockiſh <hi>Engliſhman</hi> was I, that I could not ſpy where the Miſchief, or the Popery lay in that harmleſs and true Expreſſion. — But comes me our <hi>Obſervator,</hi> and very gravely and formally, (as he never opens, but he makes up his Mouth in <hi>Mood</hi> and <hi>Figure</hi>) nay, you 'ſcape well, if he does not gore you with one or other of his <hi>dilemma</hi>'s, a keen tool, with which (juſt ſuch another, <hi>W.S.</hi> gall'd him that writ concerning the <hi>Contempt of the Clergy</hi>) ſagely obſerving, That — <hi>This Aphoriſm is but borrowed from another Brother of the Quill.</hi>—</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:98367:11"/>
            <p>Now if the <hi>Obſervator</hi> had not a miſchievous Deſign to ſpoil Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi>'s Credit for ever borrowing any more, he need not have told every Body how much he was indebted and did <hi>borrow</hi> of a Brother of the Quill—</p>
            <p>But, <hi>(dear Sir)</hi> why may not one Brother borrow of another, but that the Obſervator muſt be concern'd? I dare ſay, that neither of the ſaid Brothers of the Quill, (nor are there any other Brothers of the Quill in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) but would make ſhift with their own Pittance and ſcanty Store, rather than go a borrowing to our <hi>little Obſervator;</hi> and if they ſhould, he would tell all he met, and leſſen their Credit, ſpoil them for ever borrowing any more.</p>
            <p>But as honeſt and Loyal Hearts may joyn, ſo good Wits may jump, as well as bad ones; and if ſo, then (though the <hi>Obſervator</hi> would ſeem to tell Tales out of School) 'tis but a Tale, and a Story of his own making, like all the reſt of the <hi>Sham</hi>'s he would gladly put upon the Author of that Sermon, with Deſign to make them both odious; but ſuch a Rayler will but be the black-patch to—<hi>Curſe ye</hi> Meroz. And moſt People think that the Author has hired this <hi>Zany</hi> to ſet him off with greater Luſtre; and provoke him or his Friends to a Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of himſelf and his Sermon, both which (but that Compariſons are odious, except when a mans Credit and Reputation lyes at ſtake) may poſſibly appear in good time, as innocent, polite, unblemiſht and unreproveable, as any other of his Coat; let Lyers and Slanderers vent their utmoſt Gall and Bitterneſs; our bleſſed <hi>Saviour,</hi> the holy <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> pious <hi>King Charles,</hi> the greateſt Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence cannot eſcape them.</p>
            <p>Nor can the worſt of the Authors Adverſaries be able to prove in any the worſt Inſtances of his whole Life, that any Infirmity, Sin or Temptation has befallen him,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98367:12"/>but ſuch as is <hi>common to all men,</hi> to all men, to the beſt of men, and common to the times wherein he was educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: which if ſo, the <hi>graceleſs Villain</hi> has as good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany as any in <hi>England,</hi> which is more than modeſtly ſhould ever have been ſaid, except on this Occaſion, when vile men (not for the Evil he has done, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was bred up a Fanatick and in fanatical times, but becauſe he and the times are not ſtill ſo, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) would render him odious and contemptible above others, becauſe above others he does ſo ſharply take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their Weapons, (in ſuch a beloved Text,) that has done great Service, and more than ever it will do again; thanks to the Book called <hi>Fides Divina,</hi> (ſays the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator) but let who will go away with the Thanks, I dare ſay, Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi> has as much Thanks for his great Pains, as he cares for, or needs, or did, or could expect from the <hi>Blockiſh Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I am quite tyred with this <hi>Obſervator,</hi> and weary with having to do with ſuch an impertinent, (as he juſtly ſtyles himſelf,) happy both you and I if we could ſay with a ſafe Conſcience, we had done with him; <hi>(this Aphoriſme alſo was borrowed from another Brother of the Quil.)</hi> But his ſharpeſt Thruſt is yet behind, and if that can be put by, I hope he is foyl'd.</p>
            <p>Obſerve his Obſervation <hi>p.</hi> 7.—<q>A Fright is a ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy thing, and therefore there are ſome that would have the moſt frightful and notorious Popiſh Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons huſh't up, and go Scot-free, rather than fright People with Fears of Popery.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What cannot a <hi>Schollard</hi> do and an <hi>Obſervator?</hi> He ſhall make you white, black; and black, white; 'tis ſuch a <hi>Proteus</hi> and a <hi>Changeling,</hi> and would have all others ſo.</p>
            <p>In this ſame 7. page, he makes the Author <hi>kiſs the Maſs-book,</hi> and then (by Conſequence he is) a <hi>graceleſs
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98367:12"/>Villain;</hi> but here he hooks and draws him to be guilty of the Plot, <hi>the Popiſh Plot,</hi> at leaſt Miſpriſion of Treaſon, a Concealer, and one that deſigns <hi>to have the moſt fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and notorious Treaſons buſh't up and go Scot-free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is a deadly Thruſt;</hi> well, I ſee there's no eſcaping him, the man has diſcover'd <hi>Gall</hi> in his Ink already againſt the <hi>Author,</hi> but here he mingles it with <hi>Blood;</hi> open him, and I'll lay aneven Wager, there's Blood in the very Heart of him, but 'tis inſipid, and without Salt.</p>
            <p>I think he has fairly obſerv'd and obſerv'd, 'till at laſt he has obſerv'd (inſtead of the old <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Plot) a plain <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plot in—<hi>Curſe ye</hi> Meroz.</p>
            <p>And I ſuppoſe in his next Obſervations (for tell him I expect them, but I fear his Taplaſh wants tilting, and is drawn dry) the next News (I ſuppoſe) he chearfully intends to tell you, and alſo obſerve when and where this graceleſs Villain was hang'd, drawn, and quarter'd and that <hi>Jezabel</hi>-like, when <hi>Naboth</hi> is dead, he is (what he gapes for) his <hi>Succeſſor in the Vineyard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well then, ſo let it go, dye men muſt, and as good at firſt as at laſt, rather than an <hi>Obſervator</hi> of ſo much Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhould be diſappointed. There's Difficulty in making eſcape, the Judges (nay better men than Judges) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eſcape the Laſh of ſuch <hi>Jehu</hi>'s, if they do not drive as furiouſly, (as theſe men) <hi>like mad;</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>They alſo would have the moſt frightful and notorious Popiſh Treaſons huſh't up, and go Scot-free;</hi>
               </q> They, even <hi>Privy-Counſellors,</hi> ſome have ſworn it.</p>
            <p>Ay, but the ſaid Sermon was indeed to ſome purpoſe brisk againſt the Spirit of <hi>Popery,</hi> but was not this all Umbrage and Colour, and though not diſcernable by the <hi>Blockiſh Engliſh,</hi> yet comes me the <hi>Eeagle-ey'd Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator,</hi> and anatomizing it without Fear or Wit, moſt cruelly rips it up, and taking out his <hi>Jack in a Box,</hi> pores
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98367:13"/>into't with his two Eyes, and ſpyes Treaſon, a Popiſh Plot, at leaſt a Deſign of huſhing it up, and that's Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſion of Treaſon.</p>
            <p>Some there are too that have declared that <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> and his Army that invaded <hi>Scotland Anno</hi> 1650. were bejeſuited and influenc't by the <hi>Pope and Papiſts</hi> to that March and War. Mr. <hi>Love</hi> that zealous Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian and Mr. <hi>Gibbons</hi> (that were beheaded on <hi>Tower-Hill</hi> for proſecuting the ends of the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> by the <hi>Rump</hi>-Parliament, who all of them had taken that ſolemn Oath and Covenant) tells us thus much in their dying Words. See Mr. <hi>Love</hi>'s clear and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Vindication written by himſelf, <hi>p.</hi> 33. His Words are—<q>But <hi>Cromwell</hi> (through the Counſel of the <hi>Pope,</hi> King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuits</hi>) had rather fight with the Proteſtant-covenanting Party, than with the Rebels of <hi>Ireland.</hi> By this means moſt grievous and burthenſome Taxes are continued and increaſed. I ſhall mention one thing which to the vulgar may ſeem incredible, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Juncto</hi> (meaning the <hi>Rump</hi>) at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> have (by the Exciſe, Cuſtoms, Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations and Taxes) received more Money in one year than all the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> put them all together ſince the Conqueſt, did raiſe upon their Subjects for ſuch a ſpace of time, yet the Kings called Oppreſſors, and theſe called Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo on at a great Rate, making them all Sons of the Whore of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And in Mr. <hi>Gibbons</hi>'s Speech upon the Scaffold I find theſe Words Printed with the ſaid clear Vindication.—<q>But yet a more joyful ſight do the Eyes of Antichriſt behold, ſuch an one (I dare ſay) as he never ſaw in <hi>England</hi> before, that is, a moſt faithful Miniſter and bleſſed Servant of God (meaning the ſaid Mr. <hi>Love</hi>) put to Death by Proteſtants, and ſuch as call themſelves
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98367:13"/>the moſt Pious, Religious People upon Earth. Next to him, I am brought upon the Stage to encounter with Death, and fight the bloody Battel; the Lord knows how many may follow. I pray, that I may be the laſt. But is not <hi>Joab</hi>'s hand in this? Are not the hands of <hi>Papiſts and Jeſuits</hi> in all this? I need bring no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to perſwade you to believe it; I think, very few but are convinced, that they both ſit <hi>at the ſtern,</hi> and are the <hi>chiefeſt actors,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So that in all our Age, all Rebels and Deſigners of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation, have made <hi>Popery, Jeſuitiſm, Popiſh-Plot,</hi> and <hi>Popiſhly affected,</hi> to be the <hi>Common Bear-skin</hi> to clap up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any man or Party they had a mind to worry.</p>
            <p>Thus all the Cavaliers and the <hi>Royal Party</hi> were made to be all <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or, (which will equally do the feat) <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhly affected;</hi> and when they had thus arrayed them in every Church and Market, they clapt their hands, and cryed Hallou, ſetting the People on them; and this did their buſineſs, and made the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> Rampant, till the <hi>Independents</hi> with the ſame ſtratagem pull'd them down, making the People believe, that between the Equivocating, Covenanting, Make-bate, Rebellious Presbyterian, and the Equivocating, Covenanting, Make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, Rebellious Jeſuit, there went but a pair of Sheers; whilſt the Presbyterians <hi>eccho'd</hi> the ſame ſcolding <hi>Cramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word</hi> into their Teeth again, ſaying, all the <hi>Fry</hi> of Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Independents were but the <hi>Spawn</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> and that they are all Sons of the Whore of <hi>Rome.</hi> And a <hi>notable man</hi> tells us (and I believe he'l take <hi>his Oath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on't too</hi>) that <hi>Lambert</hi> has been a Papiſt, I know not how many years, and that there are Jeſuits and Papiſts in all the Conventicles and Field-meetings in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> that craftily ſtir up the People to Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, Mutiny and Tumult; Prologueing their <hi>Popiſh-Plot</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:98367:14"/>with encouraging them to <hi>deſpiſe Dominion, and ſpeak evil of Dignities:</hi> And whether this <hi>Obſervator</hi> be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſet on to lye, rail, and find fault with ſo innocent a Sermon, and its Author, that only detects ſuch Jeſuitical and Fanatical Plots is a fit <hi>Quere;</hi> and though he dare not ſhew his Head, I doubt not but I ſhall prove e're long he is <hi>è Societate Jeſu.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if ſo, I think he has obſerv'd and obſerv'd at a fine rate, till he himſelf is obſerv'd, and Popiſhly-ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if not Popiſhly-affected; This 'tis, to bring the old Houſe over his own head: and who will be the <hi>Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Villain</hi> then? But ſince we are got into the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vein, for once I'll ſuppoſe another graceleſs Villain, who hath alſo leſs <hi>Wit</hi> than <hi>Grace,</hi> that was baſely <hi>bred,</hi> and worſe <hi>born,</hi> being the Son of a Black-ſmith, and kept at School by the Alms of the Pariſh, whoſe chiefeſt qualification for admittance in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi> was his dexterity in wiping his Fellow-Commoners ſhooes, and his beſt accompliſhment to capacitate him for a Degree, his dexterity in making Coal-fires, that got a Fellowſhip amongſt the Jeſuits, by the Tuneableneſs of his Throat in crying <hi>Adſum,</hi> and the glib voracity of it, in ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Oaths that came to hand, whoſe Luſt loſt him his Fellowſhip, in exchange for an <hi>over-worn</hi> Widow, and got a Vicaridge by the Symony of Flattery, and by the ſame Methods of back-biting, lying and ſlandering, ſtill keeps himſelf in plight to write Obſervations, to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the Reputation of his Betters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, if he be for Suppoſals, I'le fit him in my next, for at preſent I am quite tired with thinking thus long upon this <hi>Thred-bare Levite,</hi> that would <hi>wheedle</hi> himſelf into ſome Reputation, by making himſelf a <hi>Kin</hi> to the Author, as if they were <hi>both of a Tribe</hi> (forſooth,) <hi>The Tribe of Levi,</hi> p. 7.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:98367:14"/>
            <p>The <hi>Author,</hi> on <hi>all</hi> accounts, but more eſpecially for <hi>his</hi> ſake, diſclaims the Kindred, and the whole <hi>Jewiſh Tribe:</hi> if he were in <hi>Spain,</hi> this his Folly, as well as Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, would bring him into the Inquiſition: But in <hi>England</hi> the Clergy are all of them <hi>as much</hi> (and ſome of them <hi>much more</hi>) of the Tribe of <hi>Simeon</hi> rather than <hi>Levi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Could any, without <hi>impudent Cavil and Forgery</hi> ſay, as the <hi>Obſervator</hi> does, p. 3. That <hi>All, and every bit of the ſaid Sermon that is worth reading, is Printed before in three or four octavo pages, by</hi> N. Brook, <hi>with very ſmall variation of words, from that preach'd at</hi> Guild-hall?</p>
            <p>'Tis very ſtrange then there ſhould be ſuch a pother about the latter, if it only contain three or four octavo pages, and moſt of them too <hi>Ryme Burleſque?</hi> as he calls it.</p>
            <p>The Author does not ſay, he <hi>never read</hi> the Verſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or never ſpoke a word <hi>of it</hi> before, but never <hi>preach'd</hi> upon it before; for, <hi>inſiſting upon a Text in a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,</hi> is certainly all one with <hi>preaching</hi> upon it.</p>
            <p>No doubt but multitudes have found out the true meaning of that Text before we were born, there's more wonder any man ſhould miſs of the meaning thereof, than not find it. The Author does not in the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend himſelf as the <hi>firſt,</hi> or <hi>onely</hi> Finder and Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer; but humbly ſuppoſes that other men (beſides <hi>Columbus</hi>) may Trade in the <hi>Indies.</hi> How fearful the <hi>Obſervator</hi> is, leſt the <hi>Author</hi> ſhould get any <hi>Reputation</hi> by the ſaid Sermon, how <hi>early and carefully</hi> does he beſtir himſelf to leſſen it?</p>
            <p>But if he knew the <hi>Author</hi>'s temper, as well as I know it, he ſhould not need thus to afflict himſelf: The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor never daign'd to ſtoop to ſuch Methods and Arts which ſome men take to be the Common Road to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98367:15"/>but leaves them to <hi>ſupple pick-thanks,</hi> Diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers, Symoniſts, and Flatterers, whilſt the Author thinks he <hi>ſcapes fair,</hi> if great men do him no <hi>miſchief,</hi> no <hi>wrong,</hi> nor <hi>injuſtice;</hi> further <hi>favour</hi> he never did, nor, I dare ſay, ever will crave; but had alwayes rather have gone ten miles another way, than meet any Great man, and Lordly. <hi>Quae ſupra nos, nihil ad nos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Preferment is onely for men of more <hi>pliant, ſuppliant,</hi> cringing and crouching Arts, and great Aims and Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; why ſhould men trouble their heads with him, that troubles his Head with no man in particular, but onely ſtudies the quiet of himſelf and mankind, if they would take his Advice.</p>
            <p>But hereafter, who (that's <hi>wiſe</hi>) will trouble himſelf with the rabble? Is this the Reception, this the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment and Encouragement? then, <hi>Si populus vult de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipi, decipiatur.</hi> I ſay again, Let them run as faſt as they have a mind, to their Ruine, Mutiny, Tumult, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: Let them run and be hang'd, and let the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>Free-booters</hi> in the mean time <hi>wheedle</hi> the Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combs, and <hi>pick their pockets,</hi> till they leave them as em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty as their <hi>pates.</hi> Here's a doe with a pack of ſneaking <hi>Vaux</hi>'s, <hi>Obſervators</hi> and <hi>Dark-lanthorn-men,</hi> underminers of mens <hi>Reputations;</hi> nay, 'tis a baſer Employ than <hi>Vaux</hi>'s, in one ſenſe, namely, inſomuch as a man's Reputation is and ought to be dearer to him than his Life: Theſe ſame Slanderers, amongſt the <hi>Lydians</hi> were adjudged <hi>Felons,</hi> and puniſhed with Death, as murtherers of mens Names and good Fame.</p>
            <p>And <hi>juſtly,</hi> for they make thouſands to hate a man mortally, and to death, whom yet poſſibly they never ſaw, but in the falſe and ugly colours they pourtray him, nor ever knew any harm <hi>in</hi> him, or <hi>by</hi> him, of their own knowledge.</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:98367:15"/>
            <p>But, you'l ſay, none but Knaves and Fools will judge and condemn when they hear but of one Ear, when they hear the Plaint onely, much leſs hate a man they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew, nor ſaw no hurt in; but onely by Fame, which is commonly a Lyar.</p>
            <p>I grant it; But, is not the World well ſtock't with <hi>Knaves and Fools,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> with <hi>Blockiſh Engliſh</hi> enow? <hi>Facilè credimus quae volumus;</hi> if any man, (how worthy, how innocent ſoever,) do but ſpeak againſt or thwart our darling Luſts, or beloved Opinions and darling Sins, we are apt to believe the worſt of ſuch an one that Malice can forge and invent.</p>
            <p>Thus it was of old, the old Cry was — <hi>Away with ſuch a Fellow from the Earth, for it is not fit that he ſhould live;</hi> when perhaps the moſt of the People knew not <hi>for what, nor wherefore they were met together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Obſervator rayles and Lyes, without the leaſt colour or reſemblance of Truth; for how is it poſſible a man can by any ſtratagem get his <hi>Tutour</hi>'s <hi>Fellowſhip,</hi> except he be <hi>Fellow</hi> of the <hi>ſame</hi> Colledge <hi>where</hi> he had a <hi>Tutour?</hi> Or how is it probable that the <hi>Tarpaulins</hi> ſhould be ſo <hi>All-Devout</hi> upon the ſudden, that they ſhould kick their Captain from aboard, leſt he ſhould tempt them to Debauchery with a Dram of the Bottle?</p>
            <p>For the aforeſaid <hi>Graceleſs Villain</hi> was never at Sea ſince he was a Clergy-man, but once (ſixteen or ſeventeen years ago) when the late Reverend Father in God <hi>Gilbert Lord Arch-Biſhop of Canterbury,</hi> with great importunity, prevail'd with him, and over-perſwaded him to accept of the Honourable Employment of Chaplain at Sea to his Highneſs Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> contrary to the mind and Petitions, and Endeavours of the Pariſhioners of <hi>All-Hallows-Barking, Tower-Hill, London;</hi> where the ſaid <hi>Graceleſs Villain</hi> was <hi>Lecturer;</hi> many Boats-full of the chief
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98367:16"/>Pariſhoners, rowing to <hi>Lambeth</hi> to beg of the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, that Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi> their <hi>Lecturer</hi> might not be taken from them; but not prevailing, they promis'd (and perform'd faithfully) never to chuſe a <hi>Lecturer</hi> till he return'd, but hire one from Sunday to Sunday where they could; and his Return was ſooner than any of them did expect, he <hi>voluntarily</hi> and with <hi>much a Doe,</hi> got Leave to leave that honourable Employ, chiefly, becauſe the <hi>Tarpaulins</hi> were ſo irreclaimably debaucht.</p>
            <p>Some People then of the moſt eminent City of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and all the moſt eminent of that famous Pariſh of the City, were many years ago, as well as the ſaid Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, <hi>enamour'd</hi> with that ſame <hi>Graceleſs Villain;</hi> and yet knew all the Paſſages of his Life, a thouſand times better than the <hi>lying Obſervator;</hi> I ſcorn to write any thing but what is Truth to a Tittle.</p>
            <p>And the Author had (in all probability) been <hi>Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi> there at <hi>this</hi> day, (for he is no <hi>Starter,</hi> nor <hi>Shifter,</hi> nor <hi>Swapper of Livings</hi>) but for <hi>one peeviſh old man,</hi> whoſe name I ſpare at preſent, becauſe he is dead and gone: the Biſhops have hinder'd Mr. <hi>Hickeringill,</hi> but they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver further'd him in their Lives, nor ever will, I dare ſay; plain Dealing is a Jewel, but it prefers no man, tho' it beggars many. 'Tis Juſtice (not Favour) that is requir'd for a man in Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi>'s Circumſtances, and they wrong him that gives him leſs; and if they do, he knows how to write himſelf upon them.</p>
            <p>What? cannot a man be <hi>naturally of a chearful</hi> ruddy Complection, but he muſt be forthwith proclaim'd— <hi>Debaucht?</hi> Cannot a man be <hi>merry</hi> and <hi>wiſe?</hi> Can no man be religious, but he that <hi>interferes</hi> Sighs and Groans with his Words, and <hi>disfigures his Face</hi> and <hi>Voice</hi> with Snivels and Tones? that he may <hi>appear unto men</hi> to be devout, preciſe, and religious? a Religion unworthy
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98367:16"/>the <hi>Author,</hi> and fit only for a <hi>Spleenatick</hi> and Hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Obſervator,</hi> who would make every man a <hi>Pulpit-Droll,</hi> that puts a <hi>little more Wit</hi> in a Sermon, than he is guilty of, though but juſt as much as ſhould keep up At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and keep men from ſleeping.</p>
            <p>But, Why ſhould <hi>obſerving Black-Coats</hi> endeavour thus to leſſen any mans Reputation, eſpecially of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, when there are enow to pick Holes in the Coats of all of them, though there be none? Where is the Wiſdom, the Prudence, the Religion of it the while? I ſee <hi>a mans chief Enemies</hi> (as our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſays) <hi>ſhall be them of his own Houſhold,</hi> of his own Coat, of his own Neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>But let the <hi>Obſervator</hi> proceed, (I cannot bid him— <hi>God-ſpeed</hi> in ſuch an unchriſtian, unmanly, unſcholarlike, uncharitable, lying and ſlandering Atttempt, but) let him go on, and if in Concluſion he comes off boaſting of his Gettings, he is <hi>the firſt man</hi> that did ſo, that either here or beyond Sea <hi>ever grapell'd</hi> with that ſame <hi>grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Villain</hi> he ſo calumniates, and falſly reviles; creeping <hi>behind the Loyter,</hi> and dare not ſhow his Head, nor juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his Words; whereas my Bookſeller has Order to make known my Name on juſt Occaſion, if the Truth of any Word in this Reply be lawfully queſtion'd, 'tis due Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, not Fear that conceals it now.</p>
            <p>And whereas the Obſerver ſays, that the Author was of Anabaptiſtical Principles, I dare ſay, it is true, and the only Truth in all his Obſervations; and every man has Ground enough from the Letter of Scripture, to be either <hi>Pro</hi> or <hi>Con,</hi> ſo that till the Reſtauration of our Laws in his Majeſties happy Reſtauration to his Rights, in the ſole executive Power of the Laws, and the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church by Act of Parliament, any man might be an Anabaptiſt without Sin: For as the <hi>Learned Dr.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98367:17"/>Saunderſon, de Sabbatho,</hi> in his Caſes of Conſcience, well does diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>Jus Divinum poſitivum,</hi> and <hi>Jus Humanum Eccleſiaſticum:</hi> of the firſt Divine Right, and ſtrict ſenſe, namely, things that are enjoyned by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Commandment of God in his Holy Word, or may be deduced therefrom by <hi>neceſſary, evident,</hi> and <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative</hi> illation; there are not many things <hi>de Jure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino</hi> under the New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>But for Divine Eccleſiaſtical Right, it ſufficeth that it may be by Humane Diſcourſe upon Reaſons of Congrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>probably</hi> deduced from the Word of God, as a thing moſt convenient to be obſerved by all ſuch as deſire unfeignedly to order their wayes according to God's Holy Will.</p>
            <p>This Diſtinction of <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> is to be obſerved the rather, becauſe it may be of very good Uſe (if rightly underſtood and applied.)</p>

            </p>
            <p>The man from firſt to laſt, it ſeems, ſtares all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon over, to ſpy faults, or any thing that looks but faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by his dis-joynting it from the reſt of the Sentence, to leſſen the Reputation (as he us'd to phraſe it) of the Sermon and the Author; and therefore tells the moſt Generous and Ingenuous Nation in the World, that there's a Plot, a Popiſh Plot, or a Plot by one that would (as he phraſes it page 7.) kiſs the Maſs-book, and all againſt their Generoſity and Ingenuity, and make them <hi>Blockiſh Engliſh.</hi>

            <p>Sure the Obſervator has got the Sermon printed for his own turn, for that printed for <hi>J.

            <p>The bottom of a mans Faith muſt be either <hi>private</hi> or <hi>publick;</hi> if private, then his own or other mens private

Nay, at this day, if there ſhould come an Angel from Heaven, or a Worker of Wonders, endeavouring to ſtagger or alter the Faith held out unto us by the holy Scriptures, infallibly as they are interpreted to us by the Laws of the Land, and by them only, the Lord our God does it to prove us, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, and we are not to believe him or them, contrary to our ſaid Laws; much leſs ſhould we believe the Comment and Interpretation of every Jugler, that cannot work any one Miracle, and is ſo far from the <hi>Gift of Tongues,</hi> that he has ſcarce <hi>one Tongue</hi> that can ſpeak <hi>Senſe</hi> or good <hi>Engliſh,</hi> though he may, like other <hi>Hocus</hi>'s, ſpeak <hi>hard</hi> Words, and <hi>new</hi> Words, or inſtead of old <hi>Jingo, Tanutus,</hi> &amp;c. cries <hi>Incomes, Outgoings, &amp;c.</hi> which are indeed <hi>Nothingneſſes.</hi>

            <p>He that believes and knows not wherefore, is an Aſs or a Beaſt, not a man; at leaſt, a very ſilly man with a bottomleſs Faith, like our <hi>Obſervator,</hi> and then at beſt, is but an Enthuſiaſt or Dreamer, a Fanatick or Frantick, <hi>alias</hi> a Madman, and knows not why nor wherefore he thinks ſo and ſo; and no man in <hi>England</hi> can have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain humane Authority to truſt to, but only our ſacred Laws.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> and People of <hi>England</hi> are (or ſhould be) one and the ſame, of and over which, under God and Chriſt, the <hi>King</hi> (in the <hi>executive</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) and the <hi>King and Parliament</hi> (in the <hi>Legiſlative</hi>

            <p>And People for want of being thus truly taught, are led to follow blindly a Stranger, whoſe own the Sheep are not; as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Papiſts who have nothing to do with the Laws of another Country, another Biſhop or Potentate, nor can never be True and Loyal Subjects whilſt they think themſelves under ſuch an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Neither can a Fanatick be a Loyal Subject and a good Chriſtian, if he thinks he may without Sin tranſgreſs and diſobey the Laws of the Land; for paſſive Obedience is no Obedience (that will juſtifie a Man) 'tis but <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows-Obedience,</hi> and the <hi>Obedience of Devils,</hi> for they obey Gods Laws <hi>paſſively.</hi>

            <p>But the ſageſt of all his Obſervations I had almoſt neglected, <hi>p.</hi> 6. concerning the <hi>cutting in two</hi> the <hi>man of Sin,</hi> or <hi>Son of Perdition</hi> (by contradiſtinguiſhing him, as he calls it) <hi>into the Spirit</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> and the Spirit of <hi>Fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> as if any thing in the World could be more a <hi>Fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi> than <hi>Popery,</hi> and thus he beſtows upon us moſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98367:20"/>at once a Taſte of his <hi>Logick,</hi> (as good) as his <hi>Rhetorick.</hi>

            <p>I thought a man might have divided a <hi>Crab</hi> into Two, very Logically and Mathematically, and yet it was not very neceſſary that thoſe Two (Parts) ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinguiſh'd.</p>
            <p>But the apteſt Reply (if ſuch <hi>obſervations</hi> require any other Reply, ſave <hi>Neglect</hi> and <hi>Scorn</hi>) is an <hi>Aphoriſm</hi> too, borrowed from a Brother of the Quill; namely, — <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons are generally odious, eſpecially betwixt things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably good,</hi> namely, Popery and Fanaticiſme, Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Foppery.</p>
            <p>I am in the <hi>Obſervator</hi>'s <hi>Debt,</hi> (I confeſs) thus by <hi>bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing</hi> of him, but if he will take my word, (though I am now (like a <hi>Great man</hi> when his Creditors <hi>dun</hi> him) <hi>in great haſte, and cannot ſtay</hi>) yet, <hi>upon my Word and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> I give it here <hi>under my hand,</hi> that I'le <hi>pay him off</hi> in my next; if it be but for belying Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi> ſo <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently</hi> out of his own Book, <hi>Greg.

               </q> whereas there is not one word in that Book concerning — <hi>Curſe ye Meroz,</hi> — but the <hi>Interpretation</hi> of it, every word whereof the <hi>Obſervator</hi> has Re-printed, (picking it here and there) in his <hi>p.</hi> 3.
