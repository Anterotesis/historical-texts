            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Fire cannot be hid in straw, nor the nature of a man so conceald, but at last it will haue his course: nature and arte may do much, but that <hi>Natura naturans</hi> which by purgation is engraffed in the heart, will be at last perforce predominant. Euen thus and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise fared it with <hi>Valentine,</hi> for after a quarter of a yéeres lamentation was ended, he entred into consideration how he might extort from his yonger brother the substance bequeathed him by his father, if not defraud him vtterly of his due, yet make such hauock of his legacie, as it should be a great deale the lighter, whereupon he began thus to meditate with himselfe.</p>

Are not we sonnes of one father, siens of one trée, birds of one nest? and wilt thou become so vnnaturall as to rob him, whom especiallie thou oughtest to relieue? Did not thy father tell thée, that brothers amitie is like the drops of <hi>Balsamum,</hi> that salueth most dangerous sores? Did he exhort vnto concord, and wilt thou shew thy selfe carelesse? Fie vpon these friuolous words, which rather then they should in such sort be preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall vnto my prosperitie, as detaine me from raigning sole Lord ouer all my fathers possessions, I would not onely in forswearing the remembrance of them, violate naturall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but with mine owne hands worke my vtter confusion: for loth would I be depriued of so triumphant an expectation.</p>

The Pirates after long expectation waited (but all in vaine) for the returne of their adherents, whom when they perceiued that euery houre they were more slack in hastening homewards, misdoubted (and not amisse) least some vnexpected casualtie might befall them, which when by their arriuall in that place they found true, seeing <hi>Lysimachus</hi> was absent, imagined that through his meanes these horrible deedes were brought to passe, but not daring to make pursuit after him, for feare of leaping ouer the shooes in transgressions, they rested patient, bearing vnto their galley thrée dead carkases (for by this time the suruiuer had yeelded nature her due) to solemnize their funeralls with a watrie buriall: what afterward betead of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I cease to relate, in that I neither esteeme the persons, nor valew their actions.</p>

            <p>This <hi>Varrona</hi> was the very picture and patterne of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable comelinesse, the perfect péece in whom nature played her prize against arte, and in whome her silent ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie pleaded both for pricke and price.

In swéete elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence she resembled <hi>Cornelia:</hi> her lookes were chearefull, yet chaste: merrie, yet modest: courteous, not contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. <hi>Hercules Gallus</hi> had all mens eares linked in the chaine which he held in his hand, but <hi>Varrona</hi> held both their eares, tongues, and hearts, all men pratled of her, all praysed her.

            <p>Being thus fettered with the pliant perswasions of fancie, impatient in his new affections, as the horse that neuer before felt the spurre, he could not bridle his new conceiued amours, but before he came to <hi>Procyons</hi> house where daily he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, he endured such a <hi>Metamorphosis</hi> in his mind, that he was constrained to crosse himselfe with these or the like contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties.</p>

            <p>By this time he was come home, and casting himselfe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately on his bed, on a suddein started as one in an extasie, surprised with the notable view of some rare singularitie, or drowned as it were in a déepe sea of surpassing delight, and wholy contemplating the substance of <hi>Varrona,</hi> which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie most curiously had shadowed in his heart, he began to fall into a slumber, but loue impatient of delaies and control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, bestowed a sharpe arrow vpon him to aggrauate his sore that alreadie was vncurable, which made him with a new sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie redouble his griefs, with this passionate part.</p>
            <p>I sée there is no stopping of the streame, but to force the greater flowing: no killing the vine by cuting it: the repressing of <hi>Cupids</hi> rage, is the more to kindle affection.

that before I saw you I knew not loues cumber, but held affection as a toy, not as a maladie, vsing fancie as the <hi>Hiperborej</hi> do their flowers, which they weare in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somes all day, and cast them into the fire for fuell at night. I liked all, because I loued none, and who was most faire, on her I fed mine eyes, but as charilie as the Bée, that as soone as she hath suckt hony from the Rose, streight flies to the Marigold. Liuing thus at my owne list, I wondred at such as were in loue, and when I read their passions, I tooke them only for poems that flowed from the quicknes of their wit, not the sorrowes of the heart. But now faire Nymph loue hath taught me such a lesson, that I must confesse his deitie and dignitie, as there is nothing so pretious as beautie, so there is nothing more piercing then fancy. For since my eye tooke a curious suruey of your excellence, I haue béen so fettered with your beautie and vertue, as (swéete <hi>Varrona</hi>) <hi>Lysimachus</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further circumstance loues <hi>Varrona.</hi> I could point out my louely desires with long ambages, but seeing in many words lies mistrust, and that truth is euer naked, let this suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for countrie wooing, <hi>Lysimachus</hi> loues <hi>Varrona,</hi> and none but <hi>Varrona.</hi> Although these words were most hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie harmonie in the eares of the Nymph, yet to séeme coy at the first courting, and to disdaine loue, howsoeuer she disdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned loue she made him this replie.</p>
            <p>Ah <hi>Lysimachus,</hi> though I séeme simple, yet am I more subtile then to swallow the hooke, because it hath a painted bait: as men are wise, so women are warie, specially if they haue that wit by others harmes to beware. Do we not know <hi>Lysimachus,</hi> that mens tongues are like <hi>Mercuries</hi> pipe, that can inchaunt <hi>Argus</hi> with an hundred eyes? and their words as preiudiciall as the charmes of <hi>Circes</hi>

Then <hi>Lysimachus,</hi> how can I beléeue that loue should vnite our thoughts, when fortune hath set such difference betweene our degrees? But thou likest of <hi>Varronas</hi> beawtie.

            <p>I grant <hi>Varrona</hi> (quoth he) many men haue done amisse, in proouing soone ripe, and soone rotten, but particular instances infer no generall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusions: and therfore I hope, what others haue faulted in, shall not preiudice my fauours.

               <hi>Lysimachus,</hi> euer since I saw thée, I fauoured thée, I cannot dissemble my desires, because I sée thou dost faithfully manifest thy thoughts, &amp; in liking thée, I haue thée so far as my honour holds fancie still in suspence, but if I knew thée as vertuous as thy actions do pretend, and as well qualified whereof you make demonstration, the doubt should be quickly decided, but for this time to giue thée answer, assure thy selfe thus, I will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther marrie with <hi>Lysimachus,</hi> or still liue a virgin, &amp; with this they streined one anothers hand.

And I pray thee what substance hath <hi>Lysimachus</hi> to endue thée with? hast thou not heard that want breakes amitie, that loue which beginneth not in gold, doth end in beggerie: that such as marrie but to a faire face, tie themselues oft to a soule bargaine? And what wilt thou doe with a husband that is not able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thée? buy forsooth a dram of pleasure with a pound of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, and a pinte of content with a whole tunne of preiudiciall displeasures? But why doe I cast stones in the ayre, or breath my words into the wind, when to perswade a woman from her will is to rowle <hi>Sisyphus</hi> stone: or to tie a head-strong girle from loue, is to tie furies againe infetters. Therefore huswife as you tender my affection I commaund you to surcease those vaine and idle matters, which please me as much as the sting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a waspe: and shall profit you as little, as fire to coole your thirst.

               </gap> of your heauenly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections so pierced my heart, that I was forced to forsake rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to followe affections and to forgoe libertie, to liue in bondage: if it may be tearmed bondage, to serue with loue such rare excellencie. Hauing tasted so much of fancies cup, and the drinke dispiersing it selfe into euery part, I felt such passions in mine vnacquainted conceits, that nothing but the rememberance of your swéetest sake, could procure my ease, fully resolued to serue, loue, and honour <hi>Varro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> till the destinies of death should denie me.

               <pb facs="tcp:6561:24"/>Thus I doubt not but thy father in watching thée, ouer-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth himselfe, and (I hope) profiteth as little, as they which gaze on the flames of <hi>Aetna,</hi> which vanish out of the sight in smoake. <hi>Varrona</hi> throughlie vnderstanding his rare and ruthfull discourse, with wéeping eyes, and sorrowfull chéere, embracing him in her armes, after a sugred kisse, gaue him this swéete comfort.</p>
            <p>The heauens <hi>Lysimachus</hi> by their miraculous working haue taken truce with our affections, whose diuine influence, I thinke by some secret contemplation do séeme to conclude our loues. It may be I haue béen liked of some, and flattered of many, but neuer deserued of any, but only of thée <hi>Lysima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> whose life, loue, and loyaltie, may iustly claime an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Lysimachus</hi> hearing this heauenlie harmonie, was so rauished betweene ioy and feare (for he feared least it had bin but a dreame) that he was not able to vtter one word, but at last sensibly perceiuing that it was no vision, but the veritie of his desires, staying himselfe by her hand, concluded thus.</p>
            <p>Ah swéete <hi>Varrona,</hi> the only reuiuer of my dying spirit, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though neither heauen nor earth can affoord me thanks suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to requite thine honourable fauour, yet shall the zealous truth and tried loue of <hi>Lysimachus</hi> affections encounter the glorie of <hi>Varronas</hi> beawtie. And I vow by the heauens, that when <hi>Lysimachus</hi> shall let his eye slip from thy beawtie, or his thoughts from thy qualities, or his heart from thy ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, or his whole life from euer honouring thée, then shall heauen cease to haue starres, the earth trées, the world ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and euery thing reuersed shall fall to their former <hi>Chaos.</hi> Hauing thus plight their troth each to other, séeing they could not haue the full fruition of their loue in <hi>Thessalia,</hi> for that <hi>Syllanus</hi> consent would neuer be granted to so meane a match. <hi>Varrona</hi> determined as soone as time and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie would giue her leaue, to prouide a great masse of money, and many rich and costly iewels for the easier carriage, and then to transport themselues and their treasure into <hi>Thracia,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:6561:24"/>
where they would leade a contented life, vntill such time as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther she should be reconciled to her father, or else by succession, (being the sole child her father had) come to the Dukedome. This deuise was greatlie praised of <hi>Lysimachus,</hi> for he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if the Duke her father should but heare of the contract, that his furie would be such, as no lesse then death would stand for painment. He therefore told her that delay bred dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that many mishaps did fall out betwéene the cup and the lip, and that to auoyd anger it were best with as much spéede as might be to passe out of <hi>Thessalia,</hi> least fortune might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent their pretence with some new despight. <hi>Varrona,</hi> whom loue pricked forward with desire, promised to dispatch her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires with as great haste as either time or opportunitie would giue her leaue, and so resting vpon this point after many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracings and swéete kisses they departed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Varrona</hi> hauing taken her leaue of her best beloued <hi>Lysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus,</hi> went immediately home, her merrie countenance giuing no suspition of mistrust at all. <hi>Lysimachus</hi> poore soule was no lesse ioyfull, that being a Shepheard, fortune had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured him so, as to reward him with the loue of a Ladie, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in time to be aduanced from that condition, to be the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of a rich Princesse. So that he thought euery houre a yeare, till by their departure they might preuent danger, not ceasing still to go euery day to his Shéepe, not so much for the care of the flocke, as for the desire he had so sée his loue, and swéete heart <hi>Varrona,</hi> who oftentimes when opportunitie would serue priuately repaired thither (albeit her fathers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition to the contrary) to feede her fancie with the sweete content of <hi>Lysimachus</hi> presence. And albeit she neuer went to visit him but most secretly, yet her oft repaire made her not only suspected, but knowne to diuers of their neighbours, who for the good will they bare to old <hi>Procyon,</hi> told him secretly of the matter, wishing him to aduertise <hi>Lysimachus</hi> of it, that he would if it were possible restraine his libertie. In the meane time <hi>Varrona</hi> was not slacke in her affaires, but applied her matters with such diligence, that she prouided all things fit
<pb facs="tcp:6561:25"/>
for their iourney. Treasure and Iewels she had gotten great store, thinking there was no better friend then mony in a strange country: rich attire she had prouided for <hi>Lysimachus,</hi> and because she could not bring the matter to passe, without the help and aduise of some one, she made the old seruant of hers called <hi>Toxeus,</hi> who had serued her from his childhoode priuie to her affaires, who séeing no perswasions could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile to diuert her from her setled determination, gaue his consent, and dealt so secretlie in the cause, that within short space he had gotten a Ship readie for their passage. The Mariners, seeing a fit gale of wind for their purpose, wished <hi>Toxeus</hi> to make no delayes, least if they pretermitted this good weather, they might stay long ere they had such a faire winde. <hi>Toxeus</hi> fearing that his negligence should hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the iourney, in the night time conueighed the Trunkes full of treasure into the Ship, and by secret meanes let <hi>Lysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus</hi> vnderstand, that the next morning they meant to depart: he vpon the newes slept very little that night, but got him vp earely and went to his sheepe, looking euery minute when he should sée <hi>Varrona.</hi> Now see the valiantnes of a virgin, or rather consider the force of loue, which maketh the weake strong, the witlesse wise, the simple subtile, yea, and the most cowards most couragious. For that morning <hi>Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona</hi> attired her selfe in one of her Pages apparell, and trud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out of the towne, as if she had béen sent on some message, and so fast as her faint legges (but strengthened by loue) could carrie her, she hasted through the woods to the fields, where the saint whom she only honoured was readie to receiue her: who though at the first he knew her not, but thought she had béen <hi>Cupid</hi> or <hi>Mercurie</hi> fallen from the heauens, yet at length by her louing lookes cast vpon him, he knew who it was, and embracing her fast in his armes, said; If <hi>Iupiter</hi> (swéete wench) should sée thée in this Pages apparell, no doubt but he would forgoe his <hi>Ganymede,</hi> and take thée vp into heauen in his stéede. O most soueraigne Ladie and Mistres, what seruice shall I be able euer to do you, which
<pb facs="tcp:6561:25"/>
may counteruaile this kindnes? what dutie can be a due recompence to this good will? If I by any meanes can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite this curtesie, I neuer doubt to be déemed vngratefull while I liue. But accept (good Ladie) I beséech you, that which is in me to performe, which is, the faithfullest heart that euer was vowed to Ladie, which when it swerueth from you, let the torments of <hi>Tantalus, Tytius, Sysiphus,</hi> and all the ruthfull rout of hell be heaped vpon me. <hi>Varrona</hi> hearing him so earnest, said.</p>
            <p>Few words (most worthie <hi>Lysimachus</hi>) are enough to win credit to a matter alreadie belieued: for only vpon confidence of your constant &amp; faithfull heart towards me, I haue thus vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduisedly aduentured mine honour as you see, desiring you not sinisterlie to thinke of this my attempt, being boldned thereto by the great loue which I bare towards you, &amp; by the loyaltie which I looke for of you towards me. Ah (said <hi>Lysimachus</hi>) if I should make any ill interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your vertuous loue and sincere affection towards me, I were the veriest villaine on earth: for I take God to witnes, I take your forward will for such frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly fauour, that I doubt my deserts will neuer be able to answer thereto as I desire: and with that he aptly ended his talk vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her mouth. Now fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence they posted to the hauen where the Ship lay, not daring any longer to stay for feare of apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sion by posts which should be sent after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Whither so soone as they were come, the Mariners were readie with their Cock-boate to set them aboord, where being coucht toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a cabbin, they horsting their maine sailes weighed anchor, and haled into the deepe, hauing a lustie gale in the poope which draue them gallantly forward. But on the next morning about the breake of the day, the aire began to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercast, the winds to rise, the seas to swell, yea presently there arose such a fearefull tempest as the Ship was in danger to be swallowed vp with euery sea, the maine mast with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the wind was throwne ouer-boord the sayles were torne, the tackling went in sunder, the storme raging s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But vpon the fourth day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout nine of the clock, the wind began to cease, the sea to waxe calme, and the skie to be cleere, and the marriners descryed the coast of <hi>Arcadia</hi>: shooting off their ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for ioy that they had escaped such a feareful tempest. <hi>Lysimachus</hi> hearing that they were arriued at some harbor, swéetly kissed <hi>Varrona,</hi> &amp; bad her be of good courage, being set on land, and rewarding the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners bountifully for their paines, they soiourned in a little vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage a mile distant from the sea, where after they had rested for a day, they made prouisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their mariage, which according to the sacred rites was solemnely celebrated: which being perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, putting on pilgrims aparrell, they went hand in hand, and heart in hart, wailfully and wilfully wandring in that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne countrie <hi>Arcadia,</hi> to auoide further punishment and displeasure.</p>

            <p>Unhappie <hi>Procyon,</hi> whome too much courtesie hath led to these misfortunes, and vaine credulitie wrapt in the maze of these calamities.

            <p>Alas, a lamentable case, why hath not nature caused loue to ascend as well as descend? why hath she indued the Storke with this propertie, to féede his damme when she is old, and men with such malice to wish their parents death when they are aged?

But when <hi>Phoebus</hi> renuing his yéerely taske, and denying longer resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to stormie winter, had pierced earths entrailes with comfortable warmth, opening a frutefull passage for the issue of her wombe, to cloath <hi>Pomonaes</hi> branches with natures bountie, and diapre her owne mantle with <hi>Floraes</hi> sense-al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring pomp; <hi>Lysimachus</hi> and <hi>Varrona</hi> entred the maine continent of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> where séeing the late hue of horrour turned to an heauen of eyes happines, they redoubled many sighes drawne from the depth of their wofull hearts centre: for remembring that <hi>Tellus</hi> was earst dismantled, the trees bereaued of their blossomes beautie, earths naturall defects anatomized by time, in the place where frostie <hi>Hyems</hi> had displaied her ycie trophies, they lamented to thinke that these tokens of worlds mutabilitie, had recouered their former flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish by the yéeres timely alteration, but their desperate for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes (as they imagined) had no hope of any happie spring to calme the winter of their woes. Drowned in these deepe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, they procéeded pensiue, but they had not walked farre, when they espied a faire broad Oake, whose spatious branches enuironed the ground lying vnderneath with a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die circle. There they determined to rest a while their bodies wearied by long iourneis, and somewhat disburthen their soules by displaying their sorrowes.</p>
            <p>As thus they were discoursing of their fortunes, they beheld as they looked back an Arcadian, and by his habit seemed a Shepheard, who ouer-hearing the last words of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and aiming (though amisse) at the occasion of their sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,

thought that being strangers he lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> losse of their way, to which imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> applying his words, he began thus.</p>
            <p>Friends (for so I may tearme you without offence) the day is almost spent, and the night being dangerous for such as you are, or at least seeme to be, I meane strangers: accept then a simple lodging in my cottage, with such homely fare as Shepheards houses yeeld, and when to morrowes Sunne shal display his bright (though late forcelesse) beames, ye may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute your intended iourney, wherein if my directions may further you, ye shall find me readie to affoord them. They won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering at such rare humanitie harboured in those contemptible wéeds, made a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g pause as if they had enioyned their mouthes to perpetuall silence, at last <hi>Lysimachus</hi> shapt him this replie.</p>
            <p>Friend (for so your preffered courtesie bindes vs to tearme you) muse not that sobs interrupt my words, or sorrowes sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son my discourse, which onely comfort my fates haue assigned me. What we were we list not now to repeate, what we are, you sée, we grieue: a lodging in your cottage we gladly accept: your countrie fare we wil thankfullie receiue; your directions wil be néedlesse, for we wander thus vp and downe to light on some cottage, where I and my wife, with this our seruant may dwell, for we purpose to buy some Farme, and a flock of shéep, to become shepheards, meaning to liue low, &amp; content vs with a countrie life: for I haue heard some say that they drink with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out suspition, &amp; sléepe without care. And if this double fauour do procéed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you, then in requitall of your courtesie, first, we beséech <hi>Iupiter Xenius</hi> the patron of hospitalitie, and protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of strangers, to blesse our labours, prosper our attempts, and enrich your store with hoped plentie: next, we vow by that bright lamp heauens ornament, that if fortune (as she is neuer stable) raise vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so low an ebbe to the wonted height of our good hap, we will remunerate your kindnes with most ample recompence. <hi>Alexis</hi> (such was the Shepheards name) séeing maiestie in their lookes, grauitie seated in disguise, royaltie su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in base attire, gathered by these probable coniectures, that they could be of no meane degrée; mooued therefore with a dée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per remorse, he courteouslie intreated them to repaire to his

               </gap>mple lodging, and remaine there till fortune should conuert her frownes into fauours, protesting that though he could not entertaine them as the qualitie of their condition required, yet he would supplie in good will the disabling defects of his low e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state; and for the buying of a Farme (quoth he) ye come in good time, for my Landlord intends to sell both the Farme, hill, and the flocke I keepe, and cheape ye may haue them for readie mony: which wrought such chéerefulnes in their hearts, that they yéelded him millions of thanks, and accompanied him to his house. Into which when they entred, they found it not gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geously embost, yet gailie trimmed: not courtlie, yet comely: though homely, yet handsome: and they were kindlie welco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by <hi>Alexis</hi> wife, who gréeted them with a merrie counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, being by her husband certified of their fortunes.</p>
            <p>The next morne they lay long in bed, as wearied with the toile of vnaccustomed trauaile; but as soone as they got vp, they resolued there to set vp their rest, &amp; by the help of <hi>Alexis,</hi> swapt a bargaine with his Landlord, and so became maisters of the Farme, &amp; of the flock, her selfe putting on the attire of a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdesse, and <hi>Lysimachus</hi> of a yong swaine, both estéemed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous amongst y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Shepheards of <hi>Arcadia.</hi> Liuing thus iointly together, they began to be as Ciceronicall, as they were amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, with their hands thrift coueting to satisfie their hearts thirst, &amp; to be as diligent in labours, as they were affectionate in loues, so that the parish wherein they liued so affected them for the course of their life, that they were counted the very mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of a Democraticall methode. Liuing thus in a league of vnited vertues, fortune enuying their prosperitie, raised vp one <hi>Maechander</hi> to race &amp; beate down if it were possible, the firme foundation of their faithfull building, and biding together.</p>
            <p>For this <hi>Maechander</hi> glauncing his gazing eyes on the bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing beautie of <hi>Varrona,</hi> receiued so deepe an impression of her perfection in his heart, that immediately he fixed his fancie vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her comely corps. And being the chief ruler of the citie, he perswaded himself that there was none in that town so stout, but would stoupe at his lure: nor any so faire, but would faine
<pb facs="tcp:6561:30"/>
imploy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to pleasure him: but one the other side, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned vertue of <hi>Varrona</hi> came to his mind, which perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an impossibilitie to his purpose: and floating thus betwéene hope and despaire, he entred into these tearmes.</p>
            <p>O miserable wretch that I am, to whom shall I addresse my complaints? Is it the heauenly power &amp; gods of loue that haue depriued me of my senses, &amp; shewed their dunne working in me? Or is it the hellish hags, and spirits of spight, that bereaued me of reason, &amp; executed their crueltie on me? Is it loue that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth me to this lust? or is it hate y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haleth me to this hurt &amp; mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe. No, no, the Gods guide vs to goodnes, the furies of hell they force vs to filthines: neither doth that any way deserue the name of loue, which bringeth such torment to my troubled minde, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all the diuels in the world could not performe the like. But see my rashnes, why am I so blindly bold, beastly to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme against y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which proceeds altogether from nature, which nature hath imparted to all men, and which I ought to follow without repining or resisting? for so long as I follow nature as my guide, I cannot doe amisse, &amp; séeing nature hath taught vs to loue, why should I not rather proue her precepts, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke that which by natures lore is allowed? And touching tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mind, or other inconuenience that it bringeth, is it all able to impaire the least comfort which I shall enioy in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing my <hi>Varrona</hi>? Is it not méete that he which would reape, should sowe, he that would gather frute, should plant trees, he that would reach the swéete rose, should now and then be scratched with the sharpe briers? I meane, is it méet, if I purpose to possesse so proper a peece as <hi>Varrona</hi> is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I should eschew labours, or refuse any perrill in the pursute thereof? And herevpon he determined to follow the furie of his fancie, what pangs or danger soeuer he thereby indured, &amp; hauing resolued many waies in his mind how he might aspire to his purpose, at length he resolued vpon this, to institute a sumptuous banket: whereto he inuited the chiefe of the citie, amongst whom <hi>Lysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus</hi> &amp; his wife <hi>Varrona</hi> were not forgotten, the onely au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours of the feast.

            <p>Faire Ladies, as I am right ioyfull of your presence, so am I no lesse sorrowfull for the paines you haue taken, in vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking so great a iourny this darke and mistie euening, for the which I must account my selfe so much the more beholding to you, by how much greater your labour was in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, and by how much lesse your cheere shall be able to counteruaile it now you are come. And taking <hi>Varrona</hi> by the hand, he said softlie vnto her. I pittie the paines of these gentlewomen the lesse, for that you were in their company, whose piercing eyes, as celes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall starres, or heauenly lamps, might serue for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, they might soone haue slipt into the mire: but as I perceiue by your words, you are disposed to iest, and be merrie, so I am content for this once to be made the instrument thereof, thereby to ease some part of the paines which you are like to take in receiuing such troublesome guests as we are: and for our cheere you neede take no thought, for it shall be so much too good for vs, by how much lesse we haue deserued any at all your hands. After this amorous encounter, he caused the company to sit downe to the banquet, and so disposed the matter that <hi>Varrona</hi> sat at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble right ouer against him, whereby he freely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and disease, so though her face and lookes were fine and swéet, and brought delight to all the beholders eies, yet to him they wrought onely torment &amp; vexation of mind. And notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he perceiued her beauty to bréed his bane, and her lokes to procure the losse of his libertie, &amp; that as the <hi>Cocatrice</hi> by sight only slaieth, so she by curteous countenance only killed &amp; woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his heart, yet would he not refraine his eyes from behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hir, but according to the nature of the sickly patient, which chiefly desireth that which most of all is forbidden him, he so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessantly threw his passionate glaunces towards her, that his eyes were altogether bleared with her beautie, and she also at the length began to perceiue his louing looks towards her, which made her looke pale, in token of the little pleasure she tooke in his toyes, &amp; of the great feare she had least some other shuld mark them, wherby her good name might come in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The banquet being ended, euery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prepared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to heare a stage play, which was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> readie to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: But <hi>Maechander</hi> being able to play but one part, which was of a poore distracted louer, determined to goe forward with the tragedie alreadie begun betwéene <hi>Varrona</hi> and him, and séeing her set out of her husbands sight, placed himselfe by her, and entered into reasoning with her, to this purpose.</p>
            <p>If (faire <hi>Varrona</hi>) this simple banquet had bene so swéet and pleasant to your séemely selfe and the rest, as your sight is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull to me, I am perswaded you would not haue changed your chéer for <hi>Nectar</hi> and <hi>Ambrosia,</hi> which the Poets faine to be foode of the gods, but séeing there was no cause of delight in the one, &amp; the other containeth that in it which may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent the Gods the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, I shal desire you in good part to accept the one, and courteously to accept me worthy to enioy the other. And though I haue not heretofore by dutifull seruice manifested vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you the loyaltie of my loue, yet if my poore hart could signifie vnto you the assaults which it hath suffered for your sake, I doubt not but that you would confesse, that by force of loue I had woon you, &amp; were worthy to weare you. For albeit by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane lawes your husband onely hath interest in you, yet by
<pb facs="tcp:6561:31"/>
natures lawes, which being more ancient, ought to be of more authoritie, he ought to enioy you, which ioyeth most in you: which loueth you best, &amp; endureth most paine for your sake. And for proofe of natures lawes, may it please you to consider the qualitie of the she wolfe, who alwaies chooseth that wolfe for her make, who is made most leane and foule by following her: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, my tytle marcheth vnder the ensign of iustice, which is a vertue: giuing to euery one according to his deserts: &amp; that the reward of loue, is onely loue againe, I know you are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant. For all the Gods in the world are not able to requite good will, the one belonging to the mind, the other incident to the bodie: but from the equitie of my cause I appeale to your good grace &amp; fauour: and at the barre of your beautie, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hold vp my hands, meaning to be tryed by your owne courtesie, &amp; my owne loyaltie, &amp; minding to abide your sentence either of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent vnto life, or denial vnto death. <hi>Varrona</hi> hearing this discourse, looked one while read for shame, another while pale for anger: neither would disdain let her make him answer, nor grief giue her leaue to hold her peace: but sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding in a maze, betwéene silence and speaking, at length she brake of the one, and burst out into the other in this sort.</p>
            <p>If (sir) your banquet had bene no better, then this your talke is pleasant vnto me, I am perswaded the dishes would haue bene taken whole from the table without touching: but as the one was far better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the company deserued, so the other, for a far worse woman might more fitly haue séemed: &amp; if your sweet meat haue such sower sawce, the next time you send for me I will make you such an answere as was made to <hi>Craterus</hi> the Emperour by <hi>Diogenes,</hi> when he sent for him to make his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode with him in his court: who answered, he had rather be fed at <hi>Athens</hi> with salt, then to liue with him in all delicacie: so for my part, I promise you. I had rather be fed at home w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bread &amp; water, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pay so déerly for dainty dishes. Touching the paines you haue endured for my sake, I take your words to be as false towards me, as you wold make my faith towards my husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: But admit they were true, séeing I haue not bin y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

The interest which cauellingly you claime in me, as it consisteth of false premises, so though they were true, yet the conclusion which you infer thereof followeth not necessarilie. For were it so that your loue were greater towards me then my husbands (which you cannot induce me to beléeue) yet sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he by order of lawe hath first taken possession of me, your title succeeding his, your succession &amp; sute must néeds be cold &amp; naught: for as your selfe saith of lawes so of titles, the first are euer of most force, and the most ancient of most authoritie. Your woluish example though it shew your foxely braine, yet doth it in force no such proofe to your purpose, but that by my former reason it may be refelled, for that the wolfe is free from the proper possession of any: but therein truly you obserue <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in vsing the example of a beast in so brutish a cause: for like purpose like proofe: like man like matter.</p>
            <p>Your manly marching vnder the ensigne of iustice, if reason be your Captaine generall to leade you, I doubt not but soone to turne to a retire: for if it be good will which you beare me, I must néedes grant you duly deserue the like againe, but when you are able to prooue it good will to deflowre my chastitie, to bereaue me of my good name, to dispoile me of my honour, to cause me to transgresse the bonds of honestie, to infringe my faith towards my husband, to violate the sacred rites of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie, with other innumerable enormities, when I say you are able to prooue these to proceede from affection, then will I willingly yéeld consent to your request. But sée the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonablenes of your suite, would you haue me in shewing courtesie towards you, commit crueltie towards my selfe? Should I in extending mercie to you, bring my selfe to mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? Should I place you in pleasure, and displace my selfe of all ioy?

Gentlewomen of what calling and countenance soeuer? Your appeale from your owne cause to my courtesie, bewrayeth the naughtinesse thereof: for if it be not ill, why stick you not too it? if it be good, why appeale you from it? But séeing you haue constituted me iudge in this case, you know it is not the part of a iudge to deale partially, or to respect the man more then the matter, or to tender more my owne case then your cause: therefore indifferently this sentence definitiue I giue, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne you henceforth to perpetuall silence in this suite, and that you neuer hereafter open your mouth herein, being a matter most vnséemely for your honour, and most preiudiciall to my honestie: and in abiding this sentence (if you can be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>By this time the Play was ended, and his guests readie to depart, whereupon he was driuen to come forth of his chamber, to take leaue of them: and bidding his mistres good night, he gaue her such a looke, that his very eyes séemed to pleade for pittie: so that what his tongue durst not, his eyes did. His guests being gone, he disposed himselfe to rest, but loue willed him otherwise to employ that night, which was in examining particularly euery point of her answere. And though the first part séemed somewhat sharp and rigorous, and the second conteined the confutation of his cause, yet the third and last part seemed to be mixt with mettall of more milde matter, which he repeated to himselfe a thousand times, and thereupon, as vpon a firme foundation, determined to raise vp his building againe, which the two former parts of her answere had vtterlie ransackt to the ground. But mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the nature of the soyle whereon the foundation was laid, his fabrike (as if it had béen set in the sand) soone came to ruine: for by that promise of friendship, which she kindlie made him, he sinisterly conceiued hope of obteining that, which she neither with honour could promise, nor with hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie performe: and feeding himselfe with that vaine hope, in great brauerie, as in a manner assured of the victorie, he wrote vnto her to this effect.</p>

            <p>The chast eares of <hi>Varrona</hi> not able to endure this base dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, she cut of her ghostly counsel with these inuectiue words. Gentlewoman if you were endued with as many good conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as you haue liued yeares, you would neuer haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken so shamefull a message: and were it not more for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence of your yeares, then in respect of your errand, I would make your filthie trade of life so famous, that you should euer hereafter be ashamed to shew your face in any honest companie. What doe you thinke, though mony can make you a bawd, that it can make me an harlot? and though you for gaine flée no filthynesse, that I for glorie follow no faithfulnesse either towards my spouse and husband, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards my Lord and God? Doe you iudge me so couetous of coine, or so prodigal of my honour, that to get the one, I wil lose the other? Or doth he that sent you thinke so obiectlie of me, that gaine may more preuaile with me then good will, mony more then a man, iewells more then gentlenesse, pearles more then troubles which he hath endured for my sake? No let him vnderstand, if any thing could haue caused me to swarue from my duetie, loue not lure should haue allured me theretoo. But as I am fully resolued, faithfully to keepe my vowe, and promise made to my husband, so I beséech him not to bestow any more labour in attempting that, vnto which he shal neuer attaine: for before this my resolution shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersed, he shall see the dissolution of my bodie into dust. But if he will not thus giue ouer his sute, he will cause me to make those priuie to his dealings, who will make him asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of them: and for your part, packe you hence with this your trumperie, to those which measure their honour by the price of profit, and their glorie by the guerdon of gaine. This good old subaudi gentlewoman being gone away with a flea in her eare, <hi>Varrona</hi> began to thinke on the matter with aduised deliberation, and entered into reasoning with her selfe in this sort.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6561:36"/>What fearefull follie is this in me to contemne the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of so great a Lord, whom the brauest Ladie in this land would willingly receiue for husband, and I rigorouslie refuse for seruant? What is that honour whereupon I stand so stiffely? Shall it not rather increase my dignitie, to haue so noble a seruant? And what is that chastitie which I séeke so charily so kéepe? Do not some men say, that women alwayes liue chastly ynough, so that they liue charily ynough? that is, so that they conueigh their matters so couertly, that their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings be not commonly knowne: for otherwise to incontinencie were added impudencie; likewise for a woman to enter in conuersation with a rascall of no reputation, cannot be but a great blemish to the brightnesse of her name: for a foule adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, is euer worse then adulterie it selfe. And is it not a great signe she loatheth her husband, when she liketh one better, which is euery way worse? But to haue a friend of reserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whose very countenance may credit her husband, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks cannot be no great dishonour, either to the one, or to the other. What discredit was it to <hi>Helen,</hi> when she left her husband <hi>Menelaus</hi> and went with <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Troy?</hi> did not the whole glorie of <hi>Greece</hi> to her great glorie goe in armes to fetch her againe? And if she had not béen counted a péece of price, or if by that fact she had defaced her honour, is it to be thought the <hi>Graecians</hi> would haue continued tenne yeeres in warre continually to win her againe? But to leaue honour and chastitie, and come to commoditie and safetie, what do I know what perils will follow of this repulse? Is it likely <hi>Maechander</hi> will put vp this reproch patiently? May I not iustly looke to haue his loue turned to hate, and that he will either by tyrannous meanes séeke the subuersion of my hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, or by treacherous designements worke the ouerthrow of me, and my good name? For the first, <hi>Edward</hi> a King of <hi>England</hi> may serue for an example, who when the Countesse of <hi>Salisbury</hi> would not consent to content his incontinent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, he so raged against her parents and friends, as that the father was forced to perswade his owne daughter to folly, and
<pb facs="tcp:6561:36"/>
the mother as a bawde to prostitute her to the Kings lust, and bring her to his priuie chamber. For the second, the Earle of <hi>Pancaliar</hi> may serue for testimonie, who when the Dutchesse of <hi>Sauoy</hi> would not yéeld to his lasciuious lust, wrought such wiles, that she was condemned for adulterie, and iudged to suffer most shamefull death by burning. Now to preuent ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these perils, it lieth in my power: and séeing of euils the least is to be chosen, I thinke it better then to hazard life, liuing, or good name, to loose that which shall be no great losse to my husband or my selfe: for as the Sunne though it shine on vs here in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> yet it giueth light likewise to those which are in <hi>England,</hi> and other places, so is there that in me where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Lysimachus</hi> may be satisfied, and <hi>Maechander</hi> sufficed. And this encourageth me thereto the rather, for that I see by experience in most of my neighbours, that those are euer most made of, who that way deale most falsely with their husbands. Besides that, how openly soeuer they deale in these affaires, their husbands neuer heare of it: and though they do, yet will they not hearken vnto it: and albeit they do in a manner sée it, yet will they not beléeue it: and though thereto they giue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, yet will they loue them the better, to haue them leaue it the sooner. Againe, what know I whether my husband deales falsely with me, and rowe in some other streame, which if it be so, I shall but saue his soule in paying his debts, and exercise the vertue of iustice in requiting like for like. And touching the corruption of my bloud, I thinke it made more noble, in participating with one of more dignitie then is my husband. But canst thou harlot call him husband whom thou meanest so wickedly to betray? Am I in my wits to vse these senselesse words? Is it my mouth that hath vttered this blasphemie? or was it the Diuell within me that deliuered it foorth? No if I were guiltie but in thought hereto, I would restore the fault with criminall pennance: yea if I felt any part in me apt to any such euill, I would cut it off, for feare of infecting the rest of the body. Good God whither now is honour fled, which was euer wont to be the fairest flower in my garland? whither now
<pb facs="tcp:6561:37"/>
is chastitie banished, which hath béen alwaies the chiefest stay of my state? shall the sunne of my shining life be now eclipsed with an act <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o filthie, that the very remembrance thereof is no lesse grieuous then death? Why was <hi>Helen</hi> for all her heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly how any other accounted then a common harlot? and was it not onely to be reuenged on her, and on her champion <hi>Paris</hi> that the <hi>Grecians</hi> continued their siege so long? And touching the inconueniences which may incurre by this refusall, is any euill worse then dishonestie? Is there any thing to be feared more then offence? Is not the lesse of goods lesse then of ones good name? Is not an honorable death to be preferred before an infamous life? And touching the Countesse before rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, had she euer married with the King if she had not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued in her constancie to the end? And for the Dutchesse of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> what hurt susteined she by that false accusation? did it not make her glorie and vertue shew more splendentlie to the view of the whole world? yes no doubt of it.</p>
            <p>For like as streames the more you hinder their current, the greater is the deluge, or as the hearb Camomtle, the more it is suppressed, the more it spreadeth abroade: euen so vertue and honestie, the more they are wronged with enuie, the more they eleuate and extend their flourish: for honour euermore is the reward of vertue, and doth accompany it as duly as the shadow doth the body. And as the Sunne though it be vnder a cloude kéepeth still his brightnesse, albeit by vs it cannot be discerned: so vertue though it be darkened with diuelish deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, yet it reserueth her power and vigour still, though to vs it séeme vtterly to be extinguished: so that so long as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber vertue and honestie, I néede not care what man, what malice, or the diuell can deuise against me. No, no, swéete hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, I will not make thée ashamed to shew thy face amongst the best of them: and I will let thee vnderstand the villanie which that viper <hi>Maechander</hi> indeuoureth to do thee. And shall I deale so fondly indéede? Is not the repulse punishment ynough, vnlesse I bewray his doings to <hi>Lysimachus,</hi> and so procure him further displeasure? yea, I might thereby be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb facs="tcp:6561:37"/>
to set them together by the eares, whereby it might fall out (as the euent of battaile is alwayes doubtfull) that my hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band might be hurt, or slaine, and the common report would be (as the people are euer prone to speake the wrost) that I, being an ill woman, had conspired his confusion and set <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chander</hi> to sley him. And though no such thing chaunced (as God forbid it should) yet this at least I should be sure to get by it, that my husband euer after would be iealous ouer me, and right carefull would he be to keepe that which he sawe others so busily to séeke. And (such is the malice of men) perchance he would iudge some light behauiour in me to be the cause that encouraged <hi>Maechander</hi> to attempt my chas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itie. For men haue this common opinion amongst them, that as there is no smoake but where there is fire, so sieldome is there any ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent loue, but where there hath béen some kindnes shewed to kindle ones desire. Moreouer, this toy may take him in the head, that it is a practise betwéene vs two to preuent suspition, and cloake our loue: and with the firme perswasion of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible chastitie, to lull him a sléepe in securitie, and then most to deceiue him, when he least suspected guile. And if at any time he heare of it by others, I may stop his mouth with this, that I my selfe told him of it, which if I had meant to deale falsely with him, I would not haue done. Yea what know I whether he will like the better or worse of me, for bréeding such a bées nest in his braine? Lastly, I should derogate much from my owne chastitie, and in a manner accuse my selfe of pronenesse to fall that way, as though I were not strong ynough to withstand his assaults without the assistance of my husband. Yes God, in whom I repose my trust, shall fortifie me against the furie of my foes, and giue me grace with wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to escape his wiles, with charinesse to eschew his charmes, and with pietie to resist his prauitie.</p>
            <p>Now to returne to <hi>Maechander:</hi> so soone as that old bawde had related vnto him at large the answere of his mistres, he fell from the place where he sate, flat vpon the groued, and lay in a traunce a great while: and now those sparkes which before loue had kindled in him, were with continuall
<pb facs="tcp:6561:38"/>
sighes so blowne, as it were with a paire of bellowes, that they brake forth into fierie flames, &amp; that which before was fancie, was now turned into turie. For being come to himselfe, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being quite past himselfe, with staring lookes, pale counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, with fier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e eyes with gnashing téeth, with trembling tongue, in rage he roared forth these words. And shall I thus be frustrate of my desire? shall I with words and workes, with prayers and presents, pursue the good will of a daintie disdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning dame, and receiue but labor for my loue, and gréefe for my affection? But oh franticke foole, why doe I in a furie rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her, who is the most faire and courteous creature vnder heauen? No, it is that churle <hi>Lysimachus</hi> that soweth the séed of my sorrow, it is his seueritie towards her, that causeth her crueltie towards me, the feare which she hath of him, is the cause, she dareth not take compassion on my afflictions. And shall be swim in blisse, and I lie drencht in deepe dispaire? shall he be ingorged with pleasure, and I pine away in paine? No I will make him féele that once, which he maketh me feele a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thousand times a day. And herevpon determined with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe by some meanes or other, to procure the death of <hi>Lysima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> thinking thereby the sooner to obtaine his purpose of his wife. And calling vnto him one of his swearing swash-buckler seruants, he layde before him the platforme of his purpose, and told him plainly if he would spéedily dispatch <hi>Lysimachus</hi> out of the way, he would giue him a thousand crowns in his purse, to kéepe him in another country. His seruant though altogether past grace, yet for fashion sake began to aduise his master more wisely, saying.</p>
            <p>For my owne part it maketh no matter, for an other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie is as good for me as this, and I count any place my country where I may liue well and wealthily: But for your selfe, it is requisite that extraordinary care be added, in regarde that your loue towards <hi>Varrona</hi> is kowne to diuers of this cittie, by reason wherof, if I should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit any such fact, it must néeds be thought that you are accessarie thereto, which will turne, though not to your death, (for that none hath authoritie aboue
<pb facs="tcp:6561:38"/>
you to execute the rigour of the lawes vpon you) yet to your vtter shame and reproach it cannot but conuert. Tush (said his maister) the case is light where counsaile can take place: what talkest thou to me of shame, that am by imurious and spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dealing depriued of the vse of reason, and dispossessed of my wits and senses. Neither am I the first that haue played the like part. Did not <hi>Dauid</hi> the chosen seruant of God, being blasted with the beautie of <hi>Bersheba,</hi> cause her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <hi>Vrias</hi> to be set in the vanward to be slaine, which done he maried his wife? And why is it not lawfull for me to doe the like? But I know the worst of it, if then wilt not take it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thée, I will either performe it my selfe, or procure some other that shall. The man séeing how his maister was bent, both to satisfie his mind, and to gaine so great a summe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, consented assoone as opportunitie would giue him leaue to murther <hi>Lysimachus:</hi> wherewith <hi>Maechander</hi> remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned somewhat appeased, hoping now to be inuested into the throne of his delights. But the ground of this vnnaturall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise was most strangely detected. For all their consultations were ouerheard by <hi>Conscionato,</hi> an other of <hi>Maechanders</hi> men, but more religiously addicted, being then resident in a chamber néere adio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He vtterly condemning his maisters too much luxurious thoughts, and greatly misliking his fellowes impudent promise, but especially affecting <hi>Lysimachus</hi> as a man in whom the true sparkes of vertue were eminent, made manifest incontinently the whole conspiracie, which <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chander</hi> for the loue of his wife had deuised against him, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him not to account him a traytor for bewraying his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters counsel, but to thinke that he did it for conscience: hoping that although his maister inflamed with desire, or incensed by lust, had imagined such causelesse mischiefe, yet when time should asswage his desires, and moderate his affections, that then he would count him as a faithfull seruant, that with such care had kept his maisters credit.</p>

                  </gap>oorth of his hands, and retiring back with séemely shamefastnes, went for more, and being come therewith, she thanked him for his paines, saying, I pray God that the fall of the wine hinder not my winning, and bring me ill luck, for I know many that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not away to haue salt, or drinke, or any such like thing fall towards them.</p>
               <p>Madame (said <hi>Valentine</hi>) I haue often heard it disputed in Schooles, that such as the cause of euery thing is, such will be the effect, and séeing the cause of this chance was good, I doubt not but the effect will follow accordingly: and if any euill doth ensue thereof, I trust it will light on my head, through whose negligence it happened. <hi>Fuluia</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, as I know not the cause, so I feare not the effect, and in déede as you say, hitherto you haue had the worst of it, for that thereby you haue béen put to double paines.</p>
               <p>If that be all (said he) rather then it shall be said any euill to haue ensued of this chance, I will perswade my selfe that euery paine which you shall put me to, shall be double delight, and vnto me treble contentation. You must vse (quoth she then) great eloquence, to perswade you to such an impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilitie. Oh if it please you (said he) there is an Oratour which of late hath taken vp his dwelling within me, who hath eloquence to perswade to a farre greater matter then this.</p>
               <p>If (said she) he perswade you to things no more behoofe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for your selfe then this, if you will admit of my admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you shall not giue him house-roome long. Madame (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he) it is an assured signe of a frée and friendlie minde to giue good counsaile, but it is hard for one in bondage, and out of his owne possession to follow it. For what knowe you whether he hath alreadie taken entire possession of the house wherein he is, which if it be so, what wit is able to deuise a writ to remooue him from thence? If sir (said she) he entred by order of lawe, and paid you truly for it, it is reason he enioy it: mary your folly was great to reteine such
<pb facs="tcp:6561:41"/>
a tenant: but if he intruded himselfe by force, you may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully exclude him by strength.</p>
               <p>Indéede (said he) he entred <hi>vi &amp; armis,</hi> forcibly, but after vpon parley, I was content he should remaine in peaceable possession, mary as yet he paid me nothing, but he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth so frankly, that if the performance follow, a house with beames of beaten gold, and pillars of precious stones, will not counteruaile the price thereof: yet if I were placed in quiet possession of it, I would thinke my selfe richer, I will not say then the King, but which is more, then God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, who ruleth heauen and earth.

               <p>The Lady smelling the drifts of his deuises, and séeing the end of his talke séemed to tend to loue, and that touching her owne selfe, thought not good to draw on their discourse any longer, but concluded with this answere. As I am altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant what your obscure talke meaneth, so care I not to be acquainted with any such companie as is your Landlord, for so (me thinks by you) I may more fitlie call him, then tearme him your tenant: and so departed away into her lodging.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Valentine</hi> likewise his mistres being gone, gate him to his Chamber to entertaine his amorous conceipts, and being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, brake foorth into these words. O friendly fortune, if conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually hereafter thou furiouslie frowne vpon me, yet shall I all the dayes of my life count my selfe bound vnto thée, for the onely pleasure which this day thou hast affoorded me, in giuing me occasion to talke with her, whose angels voice made such

heauenly harmonie in my heauie heart, that where before it was plunged in perplexities, it is now placed in felicitie: and where before it was oppressed with care, it is now refreshed with comfort. Yea euery looke of hee is able to cure me, if I were in most déepe distresse of a most dangerous disease: euery swéet word procéeding from her sugred lips, is of force to fetch me from death to life. But alas how true do I try that saying, that euery commoditie hath annexed vnto it a discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie? How doth the remembrance of this ioy put me in mind of the griefe, which the losse of this delight will procure me &amp; yea it maketh all my senses shake, to thinke that some other shall enioy her more woorthie of her then my selfe: and yet who in this court, nay in all Christendome, nay in the whole world, is woorthie of her? No, if she neuer haue any, vntill euery way she haue one worthie of her, she shall neuer haue any. And shall I then, béeing but a poore Gentleman, séeke to insinuate my selfe into a place so high? Shall I by my rude attempt purchase at least the displeasure of her friends and parents, and perchance of hers also, whome to displease would be no lesse offensiue vnto me then death? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, and must loue néedes be rewarded with hate? must cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie be counter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Is it possible that bountie should not abide, where beautie doth abound? and that courtesie should not associate her comelinesse? Yes, I am sure at the least she will suffer me to loue her, though her yong yéeres, and high estate will not suffer her to affect me: and though she will not accept me for an husband, yet I am perswaded she will not reiect me for a seruant: and though she will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue my seruice, yet I doubt but she will affablie take the tendring thereof vnto her. And touching her parents dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, what care I to procure the ill will of the whole world, so I may purchase her good liking. Yea, if I should spend the most precious bloud in my bodie, in the pursuite of so péerelesse a péece, I woulde count it as well besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, as if it were shead in the quarrell of the Gods, thy

Prince, or countrie. For she is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goddesse whom with deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I will adore: she is the prince, whome with dutie I wil obey: she is the countrie in whole cause I will spend my life, liuing, and all that I haue. Neither is there such cause why her friends should much storme at the matter: for my lands and reuenewes are such, as that they will not suffer me to want any thing pertaining to my estate and degrée. Why <hi>Alearne</hi> a youth like my selfe, being inamoured with <hi>Ardalesia</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the mightie Emperour <hi>Otho</hi> stole her away, and married her: and do I sticke to attempt the like with one of farre meaner estate, though of farre more worthinesse? And albeit frowning Fortune tossed him for a while in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>stuous seas of aduersitie, yet at the length he arriued at the hauen of happie estate, and was reconciled to the good grace of the Emperour againe. And though at the first my ship be shaken with angrie blasts, yet in time I doubt not but to be safely landed on the shore, and haue my share of that which the shewers of shrewde fortune shall kéepe me from. He is not worthy to suck the swéete, who hath not first sauoured the sower: And as the beautie of a faire woman, being placed by a foule, blazeth more brightly, so cach ioy is made more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, by first tasting some sower sops of sorrow. Did not the perrill which <hi>Leander</hi> ventured in the Ocean, and the paine which he tooke in swimming, make his arriuall to the hauen of his heauenly <hi>Hero</hi> more happie and pleasant? yes no doubt of it: for besides the féeling of the present pleasure, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the danger past delighteth. Besides that, by how much more a man hazardeth himselfe for his mistresse sake, by so much the more he manifesteth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stancie of his soule, and meriteth solace at her hands the more worthily. This saying also is no lesse tried then true, that fortune euer fauoureth the valiant: &amp; things the more hard, the more haughtie, high &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly: neither is any thing difficult to be by him accomplished which hardly enterpriseth it. With that he tooke a Lute in his hand and played a note to a dittie which he sung as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>

And verily when I consider the common course of life, which your swéet selfe, and other maydes of your estate leade, me thinkes it is altogether like the spending of your time at this present, which is (with your leaue be it spoken) idly, vnfruitfully, without pleasure, without profit. And if my credit were such with you, to craue beléefe for that which I shal speake, I would not doubt but to perswade you to another trade of life, more commendable to the world, more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable amongst all men, and more acceptable in the sight of God. For beléeue me I pittie nothing more then vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins vaine pittie, who thinke they merit reward for liuing

               <p>Sir (said she) as your company contenteth me well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, so your talke liketh me but a little: for though I must confesse I sit at this present without doing any thing, yet in my fancie it is better to be idle, then ill imployed as your selfe is now, in reprehending that state of life which excelleth al others, as farre as the Sunne doth a star, or light darknesse: and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I meane, for my part, to passe the pilgrimage of this my short life, if either God dispose me not, or my friends force me not to the contrary.</p>
               <p>God forbid Madame (said he) you should continue your time in any such trifling trade of life, which indéed is to be counted no life at all, as the <hi>Grecian</hi> Ladies can truely tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie, who (as <hi>Homer</hi> reporteth) reckon their age from the time of their marriage, not from the day of their birth: and if they be demaunded how old they be, they begin to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber from their marriage, and so answere accordingly: for then onely (say they) we begin to liue, when we haue a house to gouerne, and may commaund our children and our seruants.</p>
               <p>Tush (said the Ladie) this is but the sentence and proper opinion of our peculiar people, who perchance by nature of their countrie or otherwise, are more desirous of hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands then other: neither is it any more reason that we should be tied to their example, then they bound to follow our virgin <hi>Vestals:</hi> or other, who consume the whole course of their life without contaminating their corps with the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of man. Nay rather (said he) without receiuing their perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from men, according to the opinion of <hi>Aristotle.</hi> But Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame I did not produce that example as necessarie for all to follow, but as profitable to prooue and shew, what base account they made of virginitie, which you so highly estéeme of. But to leaue particular opinions, and come to generall constitutions and customes, I meane both naturall, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and diuine lawes, and you shall sée them all to make

And first if you consider natures, which in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of creatures without reason are plainely set downe, you shall behold no liuing wight in the world vniuersall, but that so soone as by age they are apt thereto, applie themselues to that life whereby their kind may be conserued, and number increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Behold the high flying Falcon, which soareth so high in the aire, that a man would thinke she should neither stoupe to lure or lust: yet she is no sooner an Entermurer, or at the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest a white Hawke, but that of her owne accord she com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the call of the Tersell-gentle her mate. Likewise the Doe, which flingeth so fréely about the woods, as though she made no account of the male, yet she is no sooner a forressister, but that she seekes the societie of the Bucke. Yea if it would please your seemely selfe to enter into the consideration of your owne nature, or if your courtesie would déeme me worthie to haue the examination of your secret thoughts, I doubt not but you would confesse your selfe to feele a fierie force of that naturall inclination which is in other creatures: which being so, you must graunt to deale vnnaturally in resisting that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which cannot be ill or idle, because nature hath planted it in you. For God and nature do nothing vainely, or after a vile manner. And in that some do amisse in rebelling against her, their owne scrupulous nicenesse is the cause, when they will impose vpon themselues heauier burdens then they are well able to sustaine, and refuse those which nature hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them to beare, being indéede but light.</p>
               <p>What talke you sir (said she) so much of nature, and of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures without reason, as though we ought to follow either the instinct of the one, or the example of the other. I haue béen alwayes taught, that reason is the rule whereby our actions ought to be directed, and that we ought to lay before vs the déeds of creatures indued with reason to follow and imitate. For if you stick so strictly to the example of brute beasts, you should vse the company of women but once or twice at the most in a yéere, as most of them do with their females, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I am sure you would be loth to be tyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:6561:44"/>Madame (replied he) a Gentlewoman of this citie hath alreadie answered this obiection for me. Why then (quoth she) will you condemne their doings in some points, and place them for patternes to be practised by other some?</p>
               <p>Yea why not (said he) otherwise you might generally take exception against the example of men, for that some men in some matters do amisse. The good euer is to be vsed, and the euill reiected. Doth not euery man so soone as his daughter is arriued to ripe yéeres, trauaile to bestow her in marriage, whereby she may enioy the fruites of loue, and participate with pleasures incident to that estate? whereby they plainely shewe that the cause why they beget them with pleasure, and bring them vp with paine, is to haue them enter into that trade of life, wherein not onely themselues may liue hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, abounding in all pleasure, but also by the fertill fruite of their bodie make their mortall parents immortall, that when they shall be blasted with age, and withered away, the issue of their seede may begin gréenely to growe, and flourishly to spring, to the great comfort both of father and daughter. For what pleasure the Grandfather taketh in the sporting pastime of his proper daughters prettie children, I thinke you partly vnderstand: and what delight the mother taketh in the toyes of her little sonne, you soone shall perfectlie perceiue, if it please you fréely to followe the friendlie counsaile which I frankly pronounce vnto you. For do you thinke, if virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie were of such vertue, that parents would not rather paine themselues to kéepe their daughters modest maydes, then straine themselues and their substance to ioyne them in <hi>Iunoes</hi> sacred bond?

But she expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced by yéeres knoweth what is best for your behoofe, and would you should follow her example, and make no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to loose that which she herselfe hath lest, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb facs="tcp:6561:45"/>
she had, we had mist so rare a iewell as your séemely selfe is, which what a detriment it had béen to my selfe, I dare not say, least you should count vertue vanitie, and truth trifling flatterie. But to our purpose, you perceiue (as I said) your parents pleased with the accesse of Gentlemen vnto you, whereby you may conceiue their minde is you should accept such seruice as they profer, and partake with those pleasures which they prefer vnto you.</p>
               <p>Why sir (said she) you altogether mistake the meaning of men in this matter: for when fathers tender marriages to their daughters, it is not for any minde they haue to haue them married; but onely for feare least they should fall to follie other waies: for knowing the fickle frailtie of youth, and our propens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Alas good Madame (said <hi>Valentine</hi>) why do you so much prophane the holie state of Matrimony, as to count it in the number of euils, whereas the Gods themselues haue entred into that calling, whereas Princes pleasantly passe their time therein, whereas by it onely mankind is preserued, and amisse and loue amongst men continued, of the woorthinesse whereof I am not sufficient to open my lips.</p>
               <p>Sir (said <hi>Fuluia</hi>) I speake it not of my selfe, but according to the opinion of the most wise and learned Philosophers that euer liued, amongst whom one <hi>Aminius</hi> so much misliked of marriage, that being demanded why he would not marrie, answered, because there were so many inconueniences inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to that estate, that the least of them is able to sley a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men.</p>
               <p>Why Madame (replied he) you must consider there is nothing in this mortall life so absolutely good and perfect, but that there be inconueniences as well as commodities there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by incurred: by that reason you may take the Sunne out of the world, for that it parcheth the Sommer gréene, and bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
<pb facs="tcp:6561:45"/>
away the beautie of those that therein blaze their faces. But to leaue naturall and humane lawes, and come to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine precepts proceeding from Gods owne mouth, doth not God say, <hi>It is not good for a man to liue alone,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made <hi>Eue</hi> for an help and comforter? Likewise in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places of Scripture he doth not onely commend mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage vnto vs, saying, <hi>Marriage, and the bed vndefiled are honourable,</hi> but also commaundeth vs to it, saying, <hi>You shall forsake father and mother, and follow your wiues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why sir (said she) and doth not God say, <hi>It is good for a man not to touch a woman? And if thou be vnmarried, remaine so.</hi> But why alleadge you not this text, <hi>It is better to marry then to burne?</hi> whereby is plainely shewed, that marriage is but a meane medicine for the burning in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupicence and lust. But because we entred into these miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, I could refer you to an historie, where it is reported that in heauen Uirgins chiefely serue God, and set foorth his glorie. And <hi>Mahomet</hi> the great Turke, when he was in heauen, said, he sawe there Uirgins, who if they issued from heauen would lighten the whole world with their bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and if they chanced to spit into the sea, they would make the whole water as swéete as hony: but here is no mention of married folkes.</p>
               <p>Belike (said he) those <hi>Uirgins</hi> are like your selfe, and then no maruaile though God be delighted with the sight of them, which perchance is the cause he hath them in heauen to attend vpon him, as first <hi>Hebe</hi> and after <hi>Ganymedes</hi> did vpon <hi>Iupiter.</hi> But generally of women, the histories record, that by bringing foorth of children they shall be honoured, and inioy a place in heauen, which must be by marriage, if honestly. But because I am perswaded that it is only for argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t sake that you disalow marriage, and that you pretend other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in words, then you intend to do in works, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to giue you the honour of the field, and thus far to yeels my consent to your opinion, that virginitie considered of
<pb facs="tcp:6561:46"/>
it owne nature, simply without circumstance is better then matrimony: but because the one is ful of perill, the other fraught with pleasure: the one full of ieopardie, the other full of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie: the one as rare as the blacke swanne, the other as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as the black crowe: of good things, I thinke the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, the more commendable.</p>
               <p>I (said she) I haue gotten any conquest thereby, I thanke mine owne cause, not your courtesie, who yéelds when you are able to stand no longer in defence.</p>

               <p>Immediately hereupon there came company vnto them, which made them breake off their talke, and <hi>Fuluia</hi> being got into her chamber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> began to thinke on the sute made vnto her by <hi>Valentine</hi>: and by this time <hi>Cupid</hi> had so cunningly carued and ingraued the idoll of his person and behauiour in her heart, that she thought him worthie of a farre more excellent wife then her selfe: and perswading her selfe by his words and lookes, that his loue was loyall without lust: true without tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling, and faithfull without faigning, she determined to accept it, if her parents would giue thereto their consent. Now <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentine</hi> nothing dismayed with her former deniall, for that it had a courteous close, so soone as opportunitie serued, set on her againe in this sort.</p>
               <p>Now Madame you haue considered my case at leisure, I trust it will stand with your good pleasure to make me a more comfortable answere. I beseech you sir (said she) rest satisfied with my former resolution, for other as yet I can make you none.</p>
               <p>Alas Madame (quoth he) the extremitie of my passion will not suffer long prolonging of remorse, wherefore I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly entreat you, presently to passe your sentence either of bale or blisse, of saluation or damnation, of life or death: or if the heauens haue conspired my confusion, and that you meane rigorously to reiect my good wil, I meane not long to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine aliue to trouble you with any tedious sute: for I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it as good reason to honour you with the sacrifice of my death, as I haue thought it conuenient to bestow vpon you the seruice of my life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:6561:47"/>Alas (quoth she) this iesting is nothing ioyfull vnto me, and I pray you vse no more of it, for the remembrance of that which you vtter in sport, maketh me féele the force thereof in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest: for a thousand deaths at once cannot be so dreadfull vnto me, as once to thinke I liue to procure the death of any such as you are.</p>

Why sir (quoth she) you know my consent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth not in my selfe but in my parents, to whom I owe both duetie and honour, therefore first it behooueth you to demaund their consent.</p>
               <p>Why Madame (quoth he) shall I make more account of the meaner parts then of the head, you are the chiefe in this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and therefore let me receiue one good word of your good will, and then let heauen and earth doe their worst. It is not the coyne, countenance or credit of your parents that I pursue: for to purchace such a treasure as is your good will, I could be content all the dayes of my life to be obnoxious vnto all calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, so that you be mainteyned according to your desire and worthinesse.</p>
               <p>Well (said she) séeing I am the onely marke at which you shoote, assay by all meanes to get my friends good liking, and if you leuell any thing straight, me you shall not misse. <hi>Valentine</hi> vpon this procured the Kings letters (for in his fauour he was highly interested) to her father in this behalfe, who hauing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vsed them, said, he trusted the King would giue him leaue to dispose of his owne according to his pleasure, and that his daughter was too néere vnto him, to sée her cast away vpon one, who for lacke of yéeres wanted wisedome to gouerne her, and for lacke of lands, liuing to mainteine her.

Doth the tender care, the carefull charge, and chargeable cost which I haue euer vsed in bringing you vp, deserue this at your hands, that you should passe a graunt of your good will in marriage without my consent? Is the pietie towards your parents, and the duetie of a daughter towards her father, so vtterly forgotten, that you will prefer the loue of an vnthrift, before my displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; and to please him care not to offend your parents, who trauaile to bestowe you vpon one worthie your estate and ours? No, neuer thinke <hi>Valentine</hi> shall inioy you with my good will, and neuer take me for your father, if you graunt him your assent thereto. <hi>Fuluia</hi> hearing this cruell conclusion of her father <hi>Hermodius,</hi> with bashfull countenance and trembling tongue framed her answere in this fourme.</p>
               <p>I beséech you good father not to thinke me so gracelesse a childe, as once to imagin, much lesse to do any thing which may heape your heauinesse, or hasten your death, the least of which two, would be more bitter vnto me then death. For if it please you to vnderstand, I haue not granted my good will to any, vnlesse yours be thereto gotten. Neither haue I as you sée preferred the loue of an vnthrift before your displeasure. But as I cannot let that noble Gentleman <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentine</hi> to loue me, so can I not, to confesse the truth, but loue him, mary in heart onely, for my bodie as you gaue it me, so shall you haue the disposing of it. And as I faithfully promise you by the loue which of duetie I owe you, that I will neuer haue any husband without your approbation, so I humbly begge of you, for the affection which by nature you beare me, that you will neuer force me to any without my good liking. For if for the transitorie life you haue giuen me, you make me pay so déerely, as to be linked with one against my will, I must néedes count it a hard peniworth, and well may I wish that neuer I had béene borne.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:6561:48"/>I beséech you (Sir) consider the inconueniences alwayes incident to those marriages, where there is more respect of money, then of the man: of honours, then of honestie: of goods, then of affection of the parties each to other.

And hereupon the marriage was concluded, and consummated, and to this bargaine only the fancie of <hi>Valentine</hi> forced him.</p>
               <p>Now behold the nature and condition of fortune: for she hauing saiued these men (namely <hi>Valentine,</hi> and the two

This <hi>Insolainder</hi> was so blinded with promotion, that vpon hope of a little commoditie purchased by his maisters death, sought as (I said) by all meanes to worke his ruine: which being perceiued (for God will not suffer such vilde attempts to be practised) <hi>Valentine</hi> prosecuted the matter so earnestly against him, that hée was throwne into prison, where for shame of his déede, and dread of deserued punishment, he did himselfe desperately to death.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Delfridus</hi> séeing his mistres too firmely fortified in vertue to be by consent vanquished by villanie, determined also by death to remoue the obstacle. And as nothing is so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible which frantike furie will not enterprise, nothing so shamefull which vnbridled desire will not vndertake, nothing so false which fleshly filthines will not forge, so to bring his purpose to passe, as <hi>Valentine</hi> on a time (in ill time) passed through a blinde lane of the citie, he throwded himselfe in a corner, and as he came by, shot him thorough with a Pistoll, which done, he forthwith repaired home, making grieuous
