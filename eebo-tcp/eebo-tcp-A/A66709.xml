            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>Will make you laugh, or elſe I ſhould be ſorry:</l>
                  <l>'Tis of a Journey lately made from <hi>Walden</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>To <hi>London,</hi> and of ſeveral places call'd in</l>
                  <l>As by the way I travel'd, with their Rarities</l>
                  <l>Of Vice and Virtue, and their great diſparities.</l>

                  <l>Who wore as good a ſword as e're man drew,</l>

                  </l>
                  <l>Called St. <hi>Saturnine</hi> as I remember,</l>

                  <l>As for the <hi>Tide</hi> I will not mention here,</l>

                  </l>
                  <l>Doth keep a Houſe like to an Under-ſheriff;</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:43135:3"/>There is good Sack, good <hi>French</hi>-Wine, and good Beer.</l>
                  <l>And if you'l dine or ſup, there is good cheer:</l>
                  <l>Or does your ſtomack to a Breakfaſt ſtand,</l>

                  <l>For thoſe men who the truth of this deny it,</l>
                  <l>Let them go there, and do as I did, try it;</l>

                  <l>That Quart was made at leaſt a three or four;</l>
                  <l>But <hi>Sol</hi> his ſpeedy journey would not ſtay,</l>
                  <l>And poſting-time did call me thence away:</l>
                  <l>Yet would my Jovial friends on me attend</l>
                  <l>Part of my Journey unto <hi>Audley-end,</hi>

                  <l>Though too much ſin may be there, more's the pity</l>
                  <l>There at the ſign (of ſuch a thing I think</l>
                  <l>As never ſwam on pond or rivers brink)</l>
                  <l>Of a <hi>Black Swan,</hi> which is as rare 'tis ſaid</l>
                  <l>As of a wench with child to be a maid.</l>
                  <l>Yet although of this Sign there's no ſuch thing,</l>
                  <l>It was a ſign there was good drink within,</l>
                  <l>And that we found freſh, ſprightly, and well taſted;</l>

                  <l>But friends at laſt muſt part, though loth they be.</l>

                  <l>I walkt alone, and ſo had none but good.</l>

I laughed heartily at his diſcourſe, and told him he was not to be blamed for being money-leſs, ſeeing the ſame was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by <hi>Jupiter</hi> before. Thoſe words ſtruck <hi>Criſpin</hi> into a great amazement, who would needs know how it came to paſs that <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſhould be ſuch an enemy to good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip? Marry (ſaid I) I think him to be no enemy unto good fellowſhip, though it hath happened that he hath predeſtin'd moſt of you to be unthrifts, the manner where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I will relate unto you.</p>
               <p>It happened ſome Ages before my Grandmother was born, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> travelled together upon the earth; <hi>Mercury</hi> was wonderfully hungry, and had no Money in his Purſe to buy him any food; and at laſt to his great comfort he ſpied where a company of Taylors were at dinner with butter'd Peaſe, eating their Peaſe with their Needles points one by one: <hi>Mercury</hi> came to them, and asked them his alms; they proudly bid him ſit down and do as he ſaw them did, and with that delivered him a Needle. The poor God being paſſing hungry, could not content his Maw with eating one by one, but turned the eye of his Needle, and eat two or three together; which the Taylors ſeeing, they ſtart up, and ſaid, What fellow, a Shovel and Spade to butter'd Peaſe! haſt thou no more manners? Get out of our company: and ſo they ſent him packing with many ſtrokes. <hi>Mercury</hi> coming back, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:43135:9"/>
demanded of him what news? And he told him how churliſhly he was uſed by the Taylors. Well, wandering on further, <hi>Mercury</hi> eſpied where a company of Shoo-makers were at Dinner with powdred Beef and Breweſs; going to them, before he could ask them any alms, they ſaid, Welcom good fellow, what is thy Stomack up? Wilt thou do as we do, and taſte of our Beef? <hi>Mercury</hi> thanked them, and ſat down and eat his Belly-full, and drank well of Double-Beer; and when he had done, went home to his Maſter; as ſoon as he came, <hi>Jupiter</hi> asked him what news? And he ſaid, I have lighted amongſt a crew of Shoo-makers, the booneſt Fellows that ever I met withal, they have frankly fed me without grudging, and therefore grant me a Boon for them. Ask what thou wilt, <hi>Mercury</hi> (quoth he) and it ſhall be granted. Why then quoth he, grant that for this good turn they have done me, they may ever ſpend a Groat afore they can earn Twopence; It ſhall be granted quoth he: <hi>Mercury,</hi> as ſoon as <hi>Jupiter</hi> had ſaid the word, he bethought himſelf, and ſaid, Not ſo, but that they may earn a Groat before they ſpend Twopence, for my Tongue ſlipt at firſt; but <hi>Jupiter</hi> replied, my grant cannot be recalled, your firſt wiſh muſt ſtand firm. And hence it comes to paſs that by <hi>Mercuries</hi> miſtake, and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piters</hi> grant, that the Journey-men of the Gentle-craft have been ever ſince ſuch boon blades, and toping good Fellows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Criſpin</hi> heard my Story with much attention, and I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that had his Purſe been anſwerable to his heart, we had taſted what liquor had been at the next Ale-houſe: But as the old ſong ſays, <hi>Poverty parts good company</hi>; my Lady <hi>Pecunia</hi> having parted from him, he ſoon parted from me, and made all the haſt he could towards <hi>London.</hi>

                  <l>And thus a man might eas'ly make it plain,</l>
                  <l>That ſome are but bare Knaves, ſome Knaves in grain.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But to return where we did leave before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </l>
                  <l>And of theſe cheating Knaves to write no more:</l>
                  <l>Commanding Time which will not ſtay for no man,</l>
                  <l>Me to my Journey once again did ſummon;</l>
                  <l>My friend and I that was ſo honeſt hearted,</l>
                  <l>Drunk to each other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then ſhook hands and parted.</l>
                  <l>Going ſtill nearer <hi>London,</hi> I did come</l>
                  <l>In little ſpace of time to <hi>Newington.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Now as I paſt along I caſt my eye on,</l>
                  <l>The Signs of <hi>Cock and Pie,</hi> and <hi>Bull</hi> and <hi>Lion,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And Handſome Hoſteſſes, with ſmiling looks,</l>
                  <l>And thought that <hi>Jack-daws</hi> might be caught by <hi>Rooks.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>So I ne're ſtaid, but unto <hi>Kingsland</hi> came,</l>
                  <l>Where at that place I found the very ſame</l>
                  <l>Signs to invite the people in to drink,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Where (if you will) you may ſpend ſtore of Chink.</l>
                  <l>From thence my courſe to <hi>London</hi> I did bend,</l>
                  <l>And at the City made my Journeys<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
