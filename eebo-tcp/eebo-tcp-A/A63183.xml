            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And, <hi>Madam,</hi> although my Lord Your Son appears not in this Calender in <hi>Bloudy</hi> Letters, yet, to Your fuller ſatisfaction, he will ever be Regiſtred in <hi>Golden</hi> ones; the declenſion of <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Fortune and Family taking

            <p>To whom then can I dedicate this Memorial ſo properly as to Your Ladyſhip, the Noble Stock from whom this Branch proceeds?

            <p>I proteſt, <hi>Madam,</hi> I cannot without ſome amazement reflect upon the Providences attended him, by Sea, by Land, in all his Concealments and Negotiations: and after he had been ſo often and publickly proclaim'd <hi>Traitor,</hi> and the Coaſts watch'd to take him, he never in the leaſt declin'd any Riſque or Hazzard whatſoever, though he knew Death attended him every Minute if he came to be diſcover'd; but with a quiet Reſignation proſecuted what his heart was ſet upon, his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> Reſtauration, and his Country's Liberty.</p>

            <head>THE Trial of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> MORDAUNT AT The pretended High Court of Juſtice.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>P<hi>ril</hi> 1. 1658. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Mordaunt</hi> was by a Guard of Souldiers taken in his Bed at <hi>Berkſhire</hi>-Houſe, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed directly to the <hi>Protector.</hi> All his Writings were then ſeiz'd on, and never returned. He was for that time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd upon his Honour, to appear upon Summons; and remained at <hi>Berkſhire</hi>-Houſe till the fifteenth: when after ſome hours Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, he was committed for <hi>High-Treaſon</hi> to the Tower. During which fourteen daies time M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Stapeley,</hi> who was one of the Witneſſes againſt him, was never pleas'd ſo much as to acquaint him with his Danger, or his own Examination, though he was Priſoner at large, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay next door to him. This was the reaſon made M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Mordaunt</hi> ſo ſecure, believing that a Gentleman could not wrong him ſo much, as to accuſe him, and not give him notice of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:37511:6"/>
His Impriſonment in the Tower was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt that ever was heard of for the time: He was ever cloſe, but the laſt three weeks had conſtantly an Officer and a Souldier by his Bed-ſide, locked in with him; two Keepers, having ſeveral Keys, ſo that, but by joynt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, no perſon could be admitted to him: and leſt this was not ſufficient, he had two Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at the houſe doors day and night. His <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die</hi>'s being with him made this unheard-of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty unſupportable, She being likewiſe ſtript and ſearch'd by women ſworn to that purpoſe; and her hair pull'd about her ears to find Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. As himſelf likewiſe afterward, and his Servants, had all their Clothes cut and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; yet nothing could be found, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely enrag'd the Officer. His very <hi>Prayers</hi> were not private, nor had he one hour free from diſturbance when he was providing for his Trial, ſo inſolent were the Souldiers with him.</p>
            <p>Till within two daies of his Trial he was permitted neither Pen nor Ink: And to the Lieutenant Colonel (whoſe name was <hi>Miller)</hi> who gave him ſo ſhort a ſummons to prepare for ſuch a Defence, he expreſs'd his diſſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in point of time, for ſo ſerious a Work,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37511:6"/>
and deſired Counſel. But the Lieutenant of the Tower refus'd his hand to their Warrant for their ſafe return; ſo he had none, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſaid he was reſolved not to own the Court, nor that way of Trial.</p>
            <p>One uſage was ſo barbarous I cannot omit it. The night before his Trial he ſate up late to provide his Defence, committing himſelf into the hands of God, as verily believing by their Cruelties ſhewn he was ordained for Death. Scarce was this perſecuted perſon aſleep by his <hi>Lady,</hi> but a Captain going the round, commanded the Souldiers to wake him, and make him ſpeak: they obeyed the command, opened the curtain, and ſtirr'd him. His <hi>Lady</hi> at firſt feared foul play, but compos'd her ſelf again; and he waking, demanded the reaſon of ſuch inſolence. No anſwer was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but that it was by Command. Are ye commanded, ſaies he, to keep me waking till my Trial? Cozen not your ſelves, by Gods aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, theſe inſolencies will not ſo diſtract me, but that I ſhall be able to make a good and juſt defence. To this the Souldiers made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, ſaying, they durſt not diſobey Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
            <p>As he was led out by a Guard, the Counteſs
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37511:7"/>
of <hi>Peterburgh,</hi> his Mother, ſent his young and onely Son <hi>Charles</hi> to receive his laſt Bleſſing. The Child, and the Servants that attended him, met M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Mordaunt</hi> at the Court of Guard, where before the ſouldiers he put off his Hat and bleſſed him, and openly commanded he ſhould be brought up in his Father's Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Religion; ſaying, that though here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after he came to that end which he was going to, he could not chuſe but die Happily and Nobly. Theſe expreſſions ſo moved the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that he left the moſt barbarous with tears in their eyes.</p>
            <p>The firſt day of Trial he was led out of the Tower by one <hi>Foſter,</hi> a Captain of the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants Regiment, (the Villain that ſhot Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> and Sir <hi>George Liſle)</hi> who held him alwaies by the hand. By reaſon of his ſwoln face, he was laſt ready, ſo that the Priſoners ſtaied expecting him at the Water-gate; which diſpleas'd the Captain ſo much, that he told him he was very lazy, for the Priſoners had ſtaied an hour in the cold. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Mordaunt,</hi> when he ſaw the Priſoners, begg'd their Pardon, who ſeeing his condition were eaſily ſatisfied. But <hi>Foſter</hi> ſaid, he could not blame his ſtay, for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver man went out to Trial ſo ſure to loſe his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37511:7"/>
Head. This was ſaid publickly; which gave M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Mordaunt</hi> occaſion to ask him if he were one of his Judges; and proteſt he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſatisfied he ought to plead before thoſe who did in effect condemn him before-hand: For the Lieutenant had ſaid as much too. This <hi>Foſter</hi> offered to give him a hundred pounds for a Piece, if he eſcap'd: yet after (having received the money) was taken off his wager by Licutenant Col. <hi>Miller.</hi>

Lord, I have heard that the Judges of the Land are the beſt and moſt proper Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Law; and I cannot but wonder I ſee none of them here: If they declare that this is the ſenſe of the Act, I'le ſubmit to the Court; if the Court will allow me Counſel, I ſhall ſubmit if my Counſel be convinced.

                  <p>My Lord, I ſee I ſhall be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born both as to Counſel and Jury, and that you endeavour not to convince me. Will this Counſel give it under their hands that this is Law by the Act of 1656? If you will ſay under your hands that this is Law, that I ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded of Jury and Counſel, and that I muſt not know the Commiſſion by which I am tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I will proceed.</p>

But, my Lord, I beſeech you he may forbear to ſay he is overborn. You ſhall have Juſtice done if you plead; if not, there was a Precedent but now: if you pleaſe to put your ſelf upon the Trial, you ſhall have a fair Trial.</p>

We conceive that this Act of Parliament hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined this very queſtion; for, my Lord, it is that you ſhall examine upon Oath, and thereupon proceed to Conviction, and final Sentence; not by Jury. And this Act of Parliament hath entruſted you to be both Judge and Jury. All <hi>Engliſh</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>men muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to what the Parliament hath done; and the Parliament hath determin'd this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that you have power to examine upon Oath, and thereupon to proceed to Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, &amp;c. If a Jury was to doe it, you were not to proceed to Conviction. This Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37511:13"/>
ſaies there is no Precedent for it; but we ſay it was the ſame in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time. They proceeded to Conviction, and final Sentence, when they proceeded againſt Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi> Did not the Parliament approve of what they did in that caſe as Juſt, Honourable, and Lawful? Did not Duke <hi>Hamilton?</hi> Did they not all Petition the Houſe? Did not the Parliament order Execution upon ſome, and Cleared others? To ſay this is without Precedent, when Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are ſo frequent, I wonder that ſhould be ſaid. To that point of a Jury, I muſt tell this Gentleman, he ſpeaks of a Jury, but hath not put himſelf upon Trial; after he hath pleaded not Guilty, then it muſt be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the manner of the Proceeding: but to come before he plead Guilty or not Guilty to deſire a Jury, this is a little to anticipate your Judgement.</p>

                  <speaker>M. MORD.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, I am concern'd for the fatal Precedent that Learned Gentleman gives of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> it being in my opinion the greateſt blurre to the Juſtice of Our Nation, and for which we may yet ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. But allow that for a Precedent, our Caſes are ſtrangely different: She a Sovereign
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37511:13"/>
Queen, and how to get a Jury of Kings and Queens to have ſate upon her would have been hard: Next, She was a Foreiner, and ought to have had ſix of her own Country to ſix of Ours, which could not be found: To this, my Lord, the next Parliament pardoned all thoſe in particular ſate upon her, as having done an action Queſtionable by the Laws of the Land.</p>
                  <p>I, my Lord, am an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man, very well known, and have a right to the Great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Petition of Right, which She had not, and therefore deſire Jury and Counſel.</p>

                  <speaker>M. ATTORN. GEN.</speaker>
                  <p>The Parliament hath thought fit to go this way, and it is not to be diſputed; they that live in this Nation are not to diſpute it. If that Gentleman will pleaſe to recollect himſelf, and not, my Lord, thus Expoſtulate and Diſpute with the Court of Juſtice; if he pleaſe to put himſelf upon Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, if he thinks himſelf Innocent, I think it beſt: and if he refuſe it, his Sentence is from himſelf.</p>

                  <speaker>M. MORD.</speaker>
                  <p>I am not Convinced at all, but forced upon it, and it is a hard thing that my Reaſon ſhould not be Convinced. If this Act doth ſay in any place, that I muſt loſe thoſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37511:14"/>
Privileges, or if the Judges will declare it to be ſo, I will ſubmit to it: If the Judges will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that I muſt be try'd thus, God's will be done; I deſire to ſtand and fall by the Laws.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>M. ATTORN. GEN.</speaker>
                  <p>We are clearly of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion we have not power in this to appoint any other Jury, nor to ſummon a Jury, we our ſelves having taken an Oath: you would doe well to plead.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>M. MORD.</speaker>
                  <p>I do not ſhun to be try'd by Act of Parliament, but refer my ſelf to the Judges, that thoſe Privileges of the Act may not be taken from me. If I am not ſuffered to diſpute the Power of the Court, yet I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire my Reaſon may be convinc'd, and that I may have Counſel.</p>

                  <hi>Here he was interrupted, and a ſilence in the Court, occaſion'd by a Note handed to the Preſident, and from him to the Lieutenant of the Tower, who got it delivered to the Priſoner. The Note contain'd theſe words: </hi>
                  <hi>For God's ſake plead, plead for my ſake, and ſtand diſputing it no longer.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the receit of this, the Priſoner chang'd his Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, mov'd thereunto by the great Kindneſs and value he had for his Lady, who being at the Hall-door in a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37511:14"/>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By this it appears how miraculouſly God preſerv'd this Gentleman, juſt as he was to be forc'd away, to Inſpire his Lady the means to ſave him. 'Tis certain, that She is an extraordinary Perſon, and never Woman ſo much oblig'd an Husband, nor did him ſo many eſſential good Offices.</hi>

                  <p>We were about a quarter of a year ago at the <hi>Half-moon</hi> Tavern over againſt the New <hi>Exchange;</hi> at that time there was no diſcourſe about the buſineſs at all.

I asked him if there was any way to help it. He ſaid, Yea, and ſaid that <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> was intending for <hi>England,</hi> and that would be a fair opportunity to redreſs all Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37511:18"/>
At <hi>Berkſhire</hi>-Houſe there he was pleaſed to enquire concerning the affairs of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and in what preparation they were, in caſe the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> ſhould land. I told him, I did not know, I had not been in the Country lately; I did believe that there would not be an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance ſuitable to his expectation. He told me ſomething concerning <hi>Surrey,</hi> that there was a conſiderable ſtrength there ready to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt us in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and joyn with us when any ſuch thing ſhould happen; he did ſay ſomething about delivering out four Commiſſions, three for Horſe, and one for Foot, to whom I know not; I dare not ſwear it, but it is to the beſt of my remembrance.</p>

                  <p>The Attourney General hath exhibited a Charge of <hi>High-Treaſon</hi> againſt the Priſoner at the Barre, that was to raiſe Force againſt the Government, and publiſh <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> to be <hi>King,</hi> and hold Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with him.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here the Priſoner made a little pauſe, and looked on his Papers, which he had juſt written on the Bar. His Defence was in theſe words:</hi>

                  <p>My Lord, you have heard the Witneſſes. The firſt Gentleman, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>John Stape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> was pleaſed to urge againſt me that I ſaid the <hi>King</hi>— <stage>[Here he was interrupted. The <hi>Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> anſwers, <hi>You mean</hi> Charles Stuart]</stage>—writ to me to engage my friends; but ſaid not that he ſaw the Letter, or that any one was by; he did not name the Time or Place, but at random, but that I ſaid ſo. Being asked about Commiſſions, he denies that I told
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:37511:22"/>
him I either had Commiſſions, or delivered any. He ſaies I gave him Encouragement to this Engagement, or what he calls it I know not: but he doth not ſay what kind of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement it was; he doth not ſay I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him Money or Preferment. He ſaies, he heard I engaged two other Gentlemen, Sir <hi>Francis Vincent</hi> and Col. <hi>Brown;</hi> but ſaies not that I told him ſo: and I can make it appear the Information he ſpeaks of was falſe. He was asked if any were by at theſe diſcourſes: he ſaid none was by. What can this be, but a bare ſingle Evidence on news, or ſurmiſe? He ſaies it was a year or more ſince. He ſaies I was intruſted by <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> about the later end of the laſt Winter. This is the ſumme of his Accuſation.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now, my Lord, compare his Brothers with his, and how farre they are agreeing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether let all the World judge, who will find they are no where of a Piece but in their Malice.</p>
                  <p>For M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Anthony Stapely,</hi> he urges againſt me, that at his Lodging I diſcours'd with him, that the way to help us was to bring in <hi>Charles Stuart:</hi> which if true, might prove trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to me. And for <hi>Surrey,</hi> I have not been in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:37511:22"/>
it this year and half. He ſaies only, to the beſt of his remembrance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſaid I had three or four Commiſſions: but he ſaies, it is to the beſt of his remembrance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but doth not ſay he ſaw the Commiſſions, and will not ſwear whether they were for Horſe or Foot. He ſaies, at the <hi>Half-moon</hi> I ſpoke with him and <hi>Mallory;</hi> of whom I have already ſpoke. He ſaies I did not name the number of any Forces that were ready, and that, I ſaid, (not ſhould, but) would come into <hi>Suſſex,</hi> if thoſe Forces were oppreſſed. He ſaies we agreed to meet the <hi>Tueſday</hi> following at <hi>Crawly</hi> with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Mallory,</hi> but ſaies that I was not there. My Lord, I do not know that place. He ſaies it is in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it is not. He ſales it was his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>John Stapely</hi> was to meet me: He ſaies it was not about any poſitive thing I was to meet there, but in General, to carry on things about the intended Deſign. He ſaies not that I ſaid it, but that I ſaid I heard that <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> would land with a conſiderable Party. He ſaies it was to debate things in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. He ſaid, it was not ſaid about the <hi>King,</hi> that He was not mentioned, but he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it to be ſo: He ſaies poſitively, I never ſpake of any number of Horſe and Foot, or
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:37511:23"/>
any thing of that kinde. I asked him when I firſt ſpoke of this; he returned no time, would not ſay any poſitive time, but ſaid all was ſince the breaking up of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: I asked him who was by; he ſaid, No body, all was private.</p>
                  <p>This, my Lord, can amount to no more then one ſingle Teſtimony: and in <hi>Rolph</hi>'s Caſe there was a ſingle Witneſs to each Act; yet Serjeant <hi>Mainard</hi> being of Counſel, he ſatisfied the Court, one Witneſs could not condemn him, though it were for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Treaſon imaginable, Attempts on the <hi>King</hi>'s Perſon: and yet this <hi>Rolph</hi> had Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel aſſigned him, and I am refus'd it.</p>
                  <p>He ſaies, the time when we were at the <hi>Half-moon</hi> was near the time when thoſe that ſerved the late <hi>King</hi> were baniſhed. He ſaies poſitively, I did not meet at the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and he gives the reaſon, (a very inſufficient one) becauſe his Brother was ſent for up: that could not hinder me. He waves his own meeting: he ſaies, all was private.</p>
                  <p>How little there is in this Evidence to bring me to ſuch a Tribunal, I leave it to the world, who I am confident will be ſatisfied, baſe Fear
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:37511:23"/>
and Malice in them, and not any Crime of mine, brought me hither: my Innocence makes me confident, and I referre my ſelf to the Court.</p>

                  <p>The Charge is for Levying Warre to alter the Government, and imbroil us again in a new Warre, to which he pleads not Guilty. For the proof of this we have offered to you Witneſſes: I ſhall take them in order as the Gentleman did at the Barre.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John Stapely</hi> ſaid, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Mordaunt</hi> ſaid the <hi>King</hi> writ to him, to encourage and engage his friends to aſſiſt him at his Coming; but ſaies not the Time when this was done. He ſaies he did not ſee the Letter; but ſaies M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt</hi> told him he had a Letter. By all the diſcourſes (becauſe that he ſaies there was no Time) it agrees that they were ſince the tenth of <hi>October</hi> 1656. And ſo it is clear within the Act, and within your Juriſdiction.</p>
                  <p>Now ſee how it was carried on. After he had told him this, how doth he encourage him, in telling him the Juſtice of the Cauſe, the Perſons engaged therein, and of Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Waller?</hi> Then, my Lord, he told him, that if the Forces of <hi>Suſſex</hi> were not ſufficient, the <hi>Surrey</hi> Forces would come to aſſiſt them, for
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:37511:24"/>
the coming in of <hi>Charles Stuart.</hi> This both <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Anthony Stapely</hi> ſay: ſo that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, under favour, that both <hi>John Stapely</hi> and <hi>Anthony Stapely</hi> do agree in moſt of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anthony Stapely</hi> ſaies that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Mordaunt</hi> came to him, tells him there were great Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. I, ſaies he, but how ſhall it be remedied? Tells him that <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> intended to come to <hi>England</hi> with a great Force, which would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs them. He asked him how the buſineſs was in <hi>Suſſex.</hi> He ſaid, it was not in ſo good a poſture as he expected. He ſaid that <hi>Surrey</hi> Forces ſhould joyn with <hi>Suſſex.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Lord, I leave it nakedly to you; if we finde this to be true, we ſubmit it to you: and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Attourney General</hi> will pray what his place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:37511:24"/>
the Law, yet there is but one Witneſs in a manner, and that differing in many Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances— <stage>[Here he was interrupted]</stage>—My Lord, I am forc'd to leave it to you, and muſt remit my Life into your hands, expecting you will remember of what Nation I am, an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man: I muſt leave it to you, and God's will be done.</p>

                     <hi>Mordaunt:</hi> God hath appeared in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and God doth appear in Mercy. As the Lord is Juſt to them, ſo he is exceeding Merciful to you: and I may ſay to you, that God appears to you at this time as he ſpeaks to Sinners in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> for, Sir, he doth clear Sinners in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> even when they are Guilty; and ſo God cleareth you. I will not ſay you are Guilty, but ask your own Conſcience whether you are or no. Sir, bleſs God as long as you live, and bleſs my Lord <hi>Protector,</hi> by whoſe Authority you are cleared.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:37511:25"/>
Sir, I ſpeak no more, but beſeech you to ſpeak to God.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this the Priſoner made no Anſwer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Sentence being paſſed againſt Sir</hi> Henry Slingsby <hi>and Doctor</hi> Hewet, <hi>the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Court was declared concerning Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> Mordaunt, <hi>which in ſhort was,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That upon conſideration of the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in reference to the Charge againſt him, and his Plea thereunto, they did adjudge him not Guilty.</p>
               <p>The Number of his Judges were thirty nine, whereof nineteen condemn'd him, and nineteen acquitted him; the <hi>Preſident</hi>'s voice turn'd the Scale. The Souldiers were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt him, except one. He was the firſt that ever was acquitted by a <hi>High Court of Juſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After Sentence pronounced, the Priſoners were guarded back to the Court of Requeſts; from thence S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Henry Slingsby</hi> and Doctor <hi>Hewet</hi> were return'd to the <hi>Tower:</hi> And M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Mordaunt</hi> left without Guard in the Chamber, as he
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37511:25"/>
was taking leave of his Keeper, and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to come to him about ſome Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the <hi>Tower,</hi> the Lieutenant ſent to him, to let him know that he was to goe back to the <hi>Tower</hi> with him. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Mordaunt</hi> refus'd it, and inſiſted upon his publick Acquitment and clearing, ſaying, he was tried in vain, if after all his perſecution and being found inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, he was ſtill kept Priſoner. He demanded on what account he was returned back, and whether the Court had not Power to releaſe him. To this he was anſwer'd, he was confin'd by a double Power the <hi>Protector</hi> had, and was only cleared as he was <hi>Protector;</hi> but as <hi>General</hi> he was ſtill his Priſoner: and until he had a Warrant from the <hi>Protector</hi> directed to him for his Releaſe, he would not free him; he acting as an Officer of the <hi>Protector</hi>'s, not as an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of the <hi>High Court.</hi> Notwithſtanding all M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Mordaunt</hi> urg'd, he took him back in his Coach. The tenth of <hi>June</hi> he was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed. Being releaſed, he unexpectedly came into <hi>Berkſhire</hi>-Houſe as they were at Supper, &amp; was received with all the affection imaginable by the Counteſs of <hi>Peterburgh</hi> his Mother, who was infinitely concern'd for him during all his Perſecutions, and aſſiſted him in making all
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:37511:26"/>
the Friends ſhe could. All his Relations there were joy'd to ſee him ſafe, whom they had ſo often lamented as loſt.</p>
               <p>The Lieutenant, after he was freed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd never any man was us'd ſo ill; but it was not long of him, but them above, and a <hi>French</hi> Servant M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Mordaunt</hi> had, who would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd him, and confeſs'd ſeveral Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and means were uſed and conceal'd in order to an Eſcape. But after a ſtrict ſearch nothing was found, &amp; the Villaine impriſon'd for an Impoſtor; though what he told was preciſely true.</p>
               <p>He was twice ſent for out of the <hi>Tower</hi> to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> &amp; was upon Examination till Night, and the ſubtileſt waies uſed to bring him to Confeſsion: But reſolv'd to know nothing might hurt a third Perſon, he vertuouſly ſtood the ſhock of <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s fury, and left him, though enrag'd, in admiration of his Temper and Conſtancy. And Colonel <hi>Goffe,</hi> to whom <hi>Cromwell</hi> committed the laſt part of his Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, gave him the Character of a <hi>Confident Reſolv'd Cavalier.</hi>
