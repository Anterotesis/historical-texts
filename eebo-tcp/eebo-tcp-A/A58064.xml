            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

You would think in this place that <hi>Virgil</hi> was pleased with his own fancy, he is so fluent; nor without cause, where he is invited by the charm of so liberal a Subject. But whether he was hastened by his design'd Poem of Bees; ot that he reserved his time for the setting forth of his <hi>Hero,</hi> not m<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n; yet not without a commendation of the Argument, as worthy to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled by all posterity.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Verum haec ipse equidem spatiis disclusus iniquis</l>

            </lg>
            <p>Now to go on where so great a man left off, to treat of a matter, which if we may believe <hi>Pliny,</hi> was able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so expert a Writer, makes me fear I can scarce free my self from the guilt of an extream confidence, besides in the imitation of so divine a Pattern, I
<pb facs="tcp:50514:6"/>
raise a greater expectation then I can satisfie: And the example which I propose to my self is not so much an advantage to me. as it leads me to an infallible despair. What a rashness is it to attempt that which partly for the difficulty of what <hi>Virgil</hi> has omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, partly for the excellency of what he has perform'd, none ever yet dared to undertake? The Culture of Gardens also being arrived to that height, that nothing can render it more perfect; and their dignity is such, that when I have done all I can, I shall have done less then they deserve.</p>
            <p>Nor was I a little discouraged by the defects of the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue, since it is an insufferable arrogance to write of a thing in <hi>Latine,</hi> of which the <hi>Latines</hi> were wholly ignorant: For the method of Gardening which is now in vogue, either of disposing Flowers in Beds, or the planting, and
<pb facs="tcp:50514:7"/>
ordering of Wall Fruits, was not used among them. But yet if I trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress either through the penury of the Language, or my own ignorance. I am so vain as to hope, that our Age which admires Gardens above all others, will forgive me, if I fall short in an Essay which none have made trial of before me. On the other side, I was encouraged by the kind reception which Gardening finds eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, even with those of the highest and noblest rank; insomuch, that I question whether it was ever in greater esteem. And it was requisite since we are grown more curious in this affair then formerly, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the delightful part of it should be communicated, which as well by the discipline of the times, as the industry of the improvers, is come to its utmost perfection. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that symmetry of parts, which
<pb facs="tcp:50514:7"/>
is now visible in every Garden, is that exact beauty to which nothing can be added.</p>
            <p>I need not say much here of the nature of that Verse, in which Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts were wont to be delivered; the <hi>Georgicks</hi> of <hi>Virgil</hi> are the best pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of it; whose natural Ingenuity is such, as will hardly admit of that more elegant dress which I have put on; considering also the humility of that style, in which a naked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed simplicity is most sought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I will not go about to excuse my self, since I have happened on a Subject in which <hi>Virgil</hi> could not easily contain himselfe; though it was no difficult matter for him to do it, especially in that duller part of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry; in which nevertheless, as <hi>Pliny</hi> observes, he onely cull'd the flowers of things, leaving out no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was capable of any splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
<pb facs="tcp:50514:8"/>
or ornament: hence proceeded those frequent digressions from his purpose, that he might avoid the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience of being tedious, which <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>robius</hi> speaks of in the <hi>5th.</hi> book of his <hi>Saturnalia.</hi> In the <hi>Georgicks</hi> (says he) after the precepts which are naturally harsh, he concludes each book with the interposition of some quicker argument: As the first with the signs of the Weather; the second with the praises of a countrey Life; the third with a mortality among Cattel; and the fourth with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent story of <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Aristaeus.</hi> Nor have I bin wanting in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: having made it my business to teach with as little rudeness as I can: and to advance the dulnesse of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction by the freedom of my fancy, that I might allay the harshness of those places, which the humility of the subject has so debased, that
<pb facs="tcp:50514:8"/>
otherwise they would be displeasing to the Reader.</p>
            <p>Yet if I appear too curious: I can defend my self by the authority of all those Greeks, who have written of Flowers, or their Culture. What can be more elegant then the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which <hi>Nicander</hi> makes in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond of his <hi>Georgicks</hi> of those Gardens in the territories of <hi>Pisa,</hi> which were water'd by the river <hi>Alpheus?</hi> In which he so often makes use of those ornaments, which Poetry derives from its fabulous times. It is almost incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible how copious and eloquent the rest are in that argument, of whom <hi>Athenaeus</hi> makes mention in his <hi>15th.</hi> book. Those who in verse treated of flow'ry Garlands, as <hi>Cratinus, Hege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias, Anacreon, Sappho, Pancrates, Chaeremon, Eubulus,</hi> and innumerable others. But I should not have so freely made use of Fables, in a matter that
<pb facs="tcp:50514:9"/>
is expected to be grave and instructive: I should have inquired into the nature of Flowers and Plants, have described their properties, and estimated their virtues. I confess I should; and I think I have done so: Yet not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting that I act the part of a Poet, and not of a Philosopher, to gain credit by the raw simplicity of a scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous discourse. But though this be a middle, and more contracted way of writing, yet it sometimes takes courage, and exalts it self, that the slenderness of the matter may not make it appear too mean and deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. To prevent which, the Soul must be excited, that so the mind (as <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creon</hi> has it) being raised to a poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique height, may breath forth divine raptures.</p>

But the mention of the Heathen Deitys, by a Christian Authour, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps will seem absurd to those, who are ignorant of the <hi>Genius</hi> of Poetry, which by the services of the gods, and a feigned terrour of their decrees, ought sometimes to elevate the mind, that it may create admiration; and for this the liberty that is usually al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Muses is warrant enough, if we had not that of Religion too, which neither thinks it self, or mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity injured, by that licence which a Poet takes to set off the truth, by the beauty and gracefulness of ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>I have not been so nice in Wood, and Water, as in Flowers, whose charms forced me to be a little more exuberant: unless it be in some places, where it was convenient to make the excellency of Poetry shine forth in the delightfuliness of Fables;
<pb facs="tcp:50514:10"/>
that so the work might not wholly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under the barrenness of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, which it treats of.</p>
            <p>In the Orchard, I fear I have not satisfy'd their expectations, who look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a long Catalogue of Fruits and Apples, which are so numerous that it were endless to go about it; in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing the different kinds of Fruit, I have only touched the heads of things, after the example of <hi>Virgil,</hi> who in the second of his <hi>Georgicks,</hi> speaks but of a few of those wines which <hi>Italy</hi> affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with so much variety and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; nor dos he take notice of any more then three sorts of Olives, and as many of Pears: for nothing is more abhorrent from the nature of that verse, then the hateful enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of particulars, which cannot but be very tedious, when it descends so low as to divide every thing into atomes, like that impertinent
<pb facs="tcp:50514:10"/>
workman whom <hi>Horace</hi> speaks of in his <hi>Poems.</hi>

            <p>A correct writer can never fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this errour, he will rather make choice with judgment, then be volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous. But since I cannot avoid being faulty in many things: I were unwise if I should endeavour to excuse all. Therefore not to tire the Reader (whose favour I implore) with a long Preface, I will make no more apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies for my self, but only add a word or two of the end, that is proposed in an instructive Poem: which as it is the same with that of all Poetry, is very easie. Not but that it is more
<pb facs="tcp:50514:11"/>
generous, then to insist wholly upon vanities and trifles: although its chief talent lies in being delightful: that which makes Philosophy it self ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear wiser then other things, is the harshness, by which it renders the truth more difficult to be attain'd. The end of that Poetry is as of all the rest to teach: which as <hi>Horace</hi> intimates to <hi>Lollius.</hi>

            <p>Though <hi>Seneca</hi> in other things is no inconsiderate writer, yet here he is so confident a <hi>Critique,</hi> that I have no pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience with him, when he censures <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> in his <hi>Georgicks,</hi> for making it his business not so much to speak truth, as what was graceful and ornamental;
<pb facs="tcp:50514:11"/>
and to have rather aimed at the delight of the Reader, then the improvement of the Husband-man: Thus he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys the main design of the Gentiler sort of Poetry, which was never more happily carryed on then by <hi>Virgil.</hi> Therefore as to this point, I value the opinion of <hi>Seneca</hi> but little; from whom I may appeal to the judgment of antiquity, which is ever to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced by all wise men. It is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest enough, how improbable it is, that a man so well seen in the works of nature, and one who acts with so much strictness in other things, should play the fool where he intends to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct. For what is more below a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous man, then to trifle where he should teach; or to dwell upon nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys, where he promises that which is serious: and no one who is not very stupid can impute this to <hi>Virgil?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Varro</hi> I find innumerable of the
<pb facs="tcp:50514:12"/>
ancients to have written of agriculture. But of all those none but <hi>Menecrates</hi> the <hi>Ephesian,</hi> and <hi>Hesiod</hi> wrote in verse, and <hi>Hesiod</hi> was the first, who as <hi>Pliny</hi> testifies: Thousands of years ago, in the infancy of learning, gave the first rules of Husbandry; though indeed <hi>Hesiod</hi> treated of the manners of men, more then the nature of things; which was what he proposed to himselfe: so that he acts the part of a Moralist, rather then of a true Poet: Yet he deserves infinite praise; but not so much as <hi>Virgil,</hi> whose perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances in that kind, are above admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. This is the reason that makes me look upon him, as one who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the mode of the rest of the Poets-promises nothing of himself, but without modesty and plainness, which in my opinion, is the most approved method of a good understanding; whose clearness is the perfect accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
<pb facs="tcp:50514:12"/>
of that wisdom, which <hi>Horace ad Pisones</hi> requires as the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of sound and correct writing.</p>

               <l>With deep-fixt roots beneath the earth descend,</l>
               <l>So their large boughs into the air ascend.</l>
               <l>Perhaps because, when we young Sets translate,</l>
               <l>They lose their virtue, and degenerate.</l>
               <l>While Acorns better thrive, since from their birth</l>

               <l>Thus we to Woods by Acorns Being give:</l>
               <l>But yet before the ground your seed receive,</l>
               <l>To dig it first employ your Laborer;</l>
               <l>Then level it; and, if young shoots appear</l>
               <l>Above the ground, sprung from the cloven bud;</l>
               <l>If th' earth be planted in the Spring, 'tis good</l>
               <l>Those weeds by frequent culture to remove,</l>

Though others in the rind betwixt each bud</l>

               <l>Mean while, with care, the branches which are joyn'd,</l>
               <l>You with a sev'nfold cord must strongly bind.</l>
               <l>And all the chinks with pitch or wax defend;</l>
               <l>For if the cruel air should once descend</l>

This way of setting Trees arose from hence;</l>

               <l>More warmth, for the reflected Sun alone,</l>
               <l>Could make their fruits attain perfection.</l>
               <l>From hence, this art to <hi>Paris</hi> old advance,</l>
               <l>And stretch'd it self through all the parts of <hi>France.</hi>

               <l>You, who my precepts hear, this ornament,</l>
               <l>Bestow upon your Gardens nor repent</l>
               <l>The building of long walls, and them infold</l>
               <l>With the green tapistry; no pains with-hold.</l>
               <l>And while you do the fruitful youth survay,</l>

When you behold your thriving nurserys,</l>
               <l>Cut all superfluous branches from your Trees.</l>
               <l>The masters hand improves the Orchard most:</l>
               <l>For he, if any Plant its hold has lost,</l>
               <l>Or hang; he trims and ties it up again;</l>
               <l>Thus the neat hedge its beauty dos regain.</l>
               <l>Vermin and Erwigs from the leaves he shakes,</l>
               <l>And of those fruits before a trial makes,</l>
               <l>Which he designs at second course to eat:</l>
               <l>The times of gathering he best can set.</l>
               <l>To the deserving praises he extends;</l>

               <l>No time is lost: the year with fruits is blest:</l>
               <l>Or else the boughs with blossoms are opprest.</l>
               <l>Nor slow nor idle lab'rers must you hire,</l>

               <l>The stubborn Earth and Plants exact the same,</l>

Plants by their looks betray their strength and years,</l>
