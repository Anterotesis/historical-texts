            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Dissolving the late
Parliament at Oxford,
<date>March 28. 1681.</date>
            </head>
            <lg>
               <l>AN Atheist now must a Monster be,</l>
               <l>Of a strange Gigantick birth:</l>
               <l>His Omnipotence do's let all men see,</l>
               <l>That our King's a God on Earth.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>Fiat,</hi> says he by Proclamation,</l>
               <l>And the Parliament is created:</l>
               <l>He repents of his work, the Dissolution</l>
               <l>Makes all annihilated.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>We Scholars were expell'd awhile,</l>
               <l>To let the Senators in,</l>
               <l>But they behav'd themselves, as</l>
               <l>So we return agen:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And wonder to see our <hi>Geometry School</hi>
               </l>
               <l>All round about beseated,</l>
               <l>Though there's no need of an <hi>Euclid</hi>'s rule,</l>
               <l>To demonstrate 'em all defeated.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Commons their Voting Problems would,</l>
               <l>In Riddles so involve,</l>
               <l>That what the Peers scarce understood,</l>
               <l>The King was forc'd to solve.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Commons for a good <hi>Omen</hi> chose,</l>
               <l>An old consulting station:</l>
               <l>Being glad to dispossess their Foes</l>
               <l>O th' House of Convocation.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>So States-men like poor Scholars be,</l>
               <l>For near the usual place</l>
               <l>They stood, we know, for a great Degree,</l>
               <l>But the King deny'd their Grace.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Though sure he must his Reason give,</l>
               <l>And charge them of some Crime:</l>
               <l>Or else by course they'l have reprieve,</l>
               <l>For this is the <hi>Third time.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>It was because they did begin,</l>
               <l>With insolent behaviour:</l>
               <l>And who should expiate their Sin,</l>
               <l>The King himself's no Saviour.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Their Faults grew to a bulk so high,</l>
               <l>As Mercy did fore-stall:</l>
               <l>So Charter forfeited thereby,</l>
               <l>They must like <hi>Adam</hi> fall.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>It is resolv'd the Duke shall fail,</l>
               <l>A Scepter to inherit:</l>
               <l>Nor right nor desert shall prevail,</l>
               <l>'Tis Popish to plead Merit.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Let the King respect the Duke his Brother,</l>
               <l>And keep affection still,</l>
               <l>As duly to the Church his Mother:</l>
               <l>In both they'l cross his will.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>They would Dissenters harmless save,</l>
               <l>And Penalties repeal:</l>
               <l>As if they'd humor Thieves, who crave</l>
               <l>A liberty to steal.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus he that do's a Pardon lack,</l>
               <l>For Treason damn'd to dy,</l>
               <l>They'd tempt, poor man, to save his neck,</l>
               <l>By adding Perjury.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Nobles threw th' Impeachment out,</l>
               <l>Because, no doubt, they saw,</l>
               <l>'Twas best to bring his cause about,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>But not to th' Commons Law,</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But hence 'twas plaguily suspected,</l>
               <l>Nay 'tis resolv'd by Vote,</l>
               <l>That the Lords are Popishly affected,</l>
               <l>And stiflers of the Plot.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Commons courage can't endure</l>
               <l>To be affronted thus:</l>
               <l>So for the future to be sure,</l>
               <l>They'l be the Upper House.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But by such Fevorish Malady,</l>
               <l>Their strength so soon was spent,</l>
               <l>That punning Wits no doubt will cry,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Oh Weeked Parliament.</hi>
