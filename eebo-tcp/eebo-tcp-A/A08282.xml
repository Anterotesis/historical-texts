            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

easie to be borne, being
neuer so weighty in the

<pb facs="tcp:20646:6"/>
therefore I haue, out of

endeuoured (in this little

rightly religious, nor truely ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.</p>
            <p>No man indeed, can be truly
knowne to be a religious or a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
man, vnlesse hee meete
<pb facs="tcp:20646:12"/>
with the contraries of both, and
therein shew his valour, constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and patience, in maintaining
the one, and shewing testimonies
of the other: for the man that is
carried away or shewes himselfe
newter, betweene true and false
Religion, or betweene vertue
and vice, hath neither Religion
nor vertue.</p>
            <p>Men are not knowne to be truly
vertuous but by tryall; for, as
there are certaine minerals, that
seeme to be the very mother of
gold or siluer, which being cast
into the fire, appeare onely sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous,
euaporate, and turne to
smoake; so is there a kind of
meeke and ciuile behauiour in
some men, that giueth a certaine
outward faire lustre, and show,
that it will beare the teste; but
when it is tryed by the fire of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
crosses, troubles, iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
reproches and the like, it
will appeare a meere shadowe
without any true shew of that
<pb facs="tcp:20646:12"/>
substantiall approued vertue.</p>
            <p>Who is not a vertuous and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous
man before he be tryed?
and who is not a patient man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he be crost? there be many
seeming very valiant, stout and
strong men, not dismaid or daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at any perill, yet if but a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
take them, the goute possesse
them, sickenesse befall them, or
any affliction crosse them, they
will either shewe their impatience,
by murmuring or grudging,
hanging downe their heads like a
Bul-rush, or sigh and groane vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the burthen, as if Maluerne
hils were fallen vpon them; and
this for want of patience.</p>
            <p>A rich man as long as he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyeth
health, wealth and honour,
wished successe in all his affaires,
nothing crossing him; how can he
but be patient in shewe? But when
his wealth turneth into want, his
health into sickenesse, his honour
into disgrace; when aduerse suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
crosses his hopes, and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb facs="tcp:20646:13"/>
seize vpon him (as hee is
a man without patience) he will
change his countenance, and by
his gesture and cariage, shewe
himselfe ashamed of the change of
his estate; fretting himselfe in
the gall of his bitter impatience,
as if God did him iniurie thus to
correct him: whence also ariseth
to the increase of his impatience,
diuersities of mens censures, as
they did of holy <hi>Iob. Surely,</hi>
(sayes one) <hi>he is a wicked man
that God doth thus punish
him:</hi> Another, <hi>Hee was very,
prodigall, hee was proude,
vaineglorious, ambitious,</hi> &amp; the
like; <hi>and therefore hath God
laid this heauie crosse vpon him:</hi>
as though they had liued in the
very bosome of the man, &amp; were
priuie to the very counsell of God,
in punishing or correcting him.</p>
            <p>In like manner doth the vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
multitude commonly censure
all men afflicted, be it by <hi>sorrow
for sinne, sickenesse,</hi> and some
<pb facs="tcp:20646:13"/>
lingring disease, <hi>pouertie, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment,
banishment, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
shipwracke, losse of
goods,</hi> by whatsoeuer meanes,
<hi>stubbornnesse of children, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnesse
betweene maried
couples;</hi> and in what sort soeuer a
man is afflicted and visited by
the hand of God (though in his
speciall loue) hee must looke for
censures, according to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
cenceits and opinions of such
as seeme to knowe the very cause
of Gods punishing and correcting
men here belowe; and yet neither
looke into themselues, nor knowe
nor thinke of the cause of causes.</p>
            <p>Seeing then, that the best and
dearest children of God are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to afflictions, crosses and
troubles of infinite kindes, and
consequently to the rash censures
of the <hi>braine-sicke vulgar,</hi> haue
they not all good cause to flie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God for this heauen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>y vertue
<hi>Patience,</hi> to support and sustaine
them, not onely in their proper
<pb facs="tcp:20646:14"/>
crosses, but in the vniust scandals
of idle men?</p>
            <p>But iudge thou no man, hee
standeth or falleth, he is comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or crossed according to the
good pleasure of God; and receiue
thou thy lot whatsoeuer it be, pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous
or aduerse, as sent of God
for thy good.</p>
            <p>If he visit thee with sickenesse,
accept it as his fatherly chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to reforme thee before thou
goe hence, thereby summoning
thee shortly to appeare before the
Throne of his Maiestie.</p>
            <p>If thou become <hi>poore</hi> bereft
of all thy goods, and haue little
or nothing left, content thy selfe;
&amp; consider, thou hast yet more left
thee then thou broughtest into
the world with thee: and were
thou neuer so rich, hadst thou ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so great possessions, neuer so
high place of dignitie in the world;
thou must be taken from all, thou
must leaue all, and all must leaue
thee: and as thy life is short, so
<pb facs="tcp:20646:14"/>
are thy pleasures, crosses and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
of no long continuance.</p>
            <p>If thou be <hi>backe-bitten</hi> and
<hi>slaundered,</hi> thinke thy selfe no
better nor more worthy the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause
of the world, then <hi>Christs
owne Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> him
selfe; who were scoffed at, railed
vpon, and scornefully reuiled,
yet reuiled not, but with patience
endured <hi>buffetings, stripes</hi> and
<hi>death,</hi> in greatest meekenes.</p>
            <p>If thou be <hi>banished</hi> thine
owne natiue Countrie, and from
thy dearest friends, inforced to
wander from Countrie to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
from Citie to Citie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<hi>wee are all strangers
and pilgrims in this world,</hi> and
nothing better resembleth our
earthly pilgrimage then doth <hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,</hi>
which may moue vs
to thinke seriously and continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of a permanent Citie promised,
after our long and tedious exile,
which endureth but a little season,
and then wee returne, ariue, and
<pb facs="tcp:20646:15"/>
shall be receiued into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
of peace, and Citie of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
freedome.</p>
            <p>If thou be troubled with <hi>diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
and refractarie chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
haue patience, remember
<hi>Adam</hi> had a <hi>Kayne: Abraham</hi>
an <hi>IsmaÃ«l; Izaacke</hi> an <hi>Esaii:
Dauid</hi> an <hi>Absalon.</hi> It is the
case of many a godly and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
father to haue an vngodly
sonne.</p>
            <p>If thou be troubled with a <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet,
proude, sullen, tarte</hi> and
<hi>taunting wife,</hi> be patient vnder
thine vnpleasant yoake; looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Scriptures, and thou shalt
finde many good and godly men to
haue gone before thee, that haue
shewed thee the way to beare this
erosse with patience; as <hi>Moses</hi>
his <hi>Zipporah: Dauid</hi> his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal,</hi>
and others: and if thou
looke neere at home, thou shalt
finde many of thy good neighbours
sicke of thy disease; and nothing
can ease it but <hi>patience, prayer,
<pb facs="tcp:20646:15"/>
good counsell in the feare of
God.</hi> These are the salues for
euery sore, the phisicke for euery
disease, and Antidotes against
euery poysonous and pestilent pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the minde.</p>
            <p>And for thy better help, I
haue (though indeed weakely)
in this Treatise, endeauoured
briefly to touch many of the cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
that may befall thee; wherein
if thou be ignorant, thou maist
therein learne in some measure,
how to prepare thee to the patient
bearing of them, wayting the
Lords leisure and his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
with prayer, in a liuely
faith, in true repentance of
all thy sinnes, which are the
cause of all thy troubles, cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and calamities what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer;
and thou shalt finde
the burthen of them light, and
the yoake which the Lord, layeth
vpon thee, easie.</p>
            <p>And be assured, that if God
correct thee here, he loueth thee,
<pb facs="tcp:20646:16"/>
and doth it to reforme thee to
saue thee. <hi>Ieremie</hi> the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
amongst the <hi>Prophets,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth,
<hi>that before the Lord
touched him with affliction,
he was like a wilde and vnta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Colte:</hi> and <hi>Dauid, the
worthiest among the Kings, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth,</hi>
that <hi>before he
was afflicted he went awrye:</hi>
And <hi>Paul the chiefe among the
Apostles,</hi> thought it his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
glory to suffer affliction for
Christ; and many they were that
he suffered, see 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>Outward affliction, or inward
sorrow for thy sinnes hurt thee
not; the one argues the loue of
God towards thee, the other thy
desire to obay him. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more hurtfull to thee, nor
more offensiue to God then thine
impatience, thy murmuring and
grudging at Gods gentle chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which are the euils of
thy minde and most afflict thee:
whereas <hi>true patience in faith,
<pb facs="tcp:20646:16"/>
is as a brasen Bulworke against
all the attemptes and assaults of
sinne and Satan;</hi> the workers of
all the crosses, troubles &amp; calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the world: Imbrace there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whatsoeuer befalleth thee
with godly patience; and
the Lord assist
thee.</p>

I haue offended thee night

to minde how graciously
thou hast kept mee this

            <p>But now Lord, now,
though late, I pray thee to

more obedience; stay me,
that I runne not this day
into any vnseemely or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly

mine eyes from vanities;
keepe vnder the vngodly

whatsoeuer I shall thinke,

to the lusts of mine owne
corrupt nature.</p>
            <p>But Lord, as I haue by

as the night succeedeth

            <p>Lord, thou madest in

in the beginning turned
his light into darkenesse, &amp;
that darkenesse hath ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shadowed
al that haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded

among whom O Lord, I
am so bemisted and blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with that originall
darkenes, as I cannot see,
nor truely conceiue the
light of thy most sacred
word, without that spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
light, shining from
thine illuminating Spirit.</p>
            <p>Thou madest two lights
O Lord, to endure for

the day, and the Moone
to giue light in the night;
<pb facs="tcp:20646:25"/>
yet doe not these lights
O Lord, direct our feete
in the wayes of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
nor our pathes in

vs to the occasions to sin;
but it is the supernaturall
light O Lord, that procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

that directeth
aright those that are thy

            <p>By this light O Lord,

            <p>So precious a Iewell it is, as

As if they were not blinded

tend to his inward comfort, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

            <p>Affliction in it selfe, and of

            <p>Whereby wee are taught

therefore not to think it strange,

yet seeing they proceed from so
louing a Father, we may not
thinke them to be inflicted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
vs in displeasure, but in a
Fatherly regard of our soules
health: Which as sinne hath
impaired, so his gentle chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

for a little while, and by vertue
of them (seasoned with Faith

our grosse and filthy corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

of our mindes, and finde our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
changed; euen as a

although, as long as we be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

that all the troubles and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
that fell so heauily vpon

If these things be not in vs, how
can we thinke our selues, or be

Let vs therefore afore all

which we must apply vnto our

to make vs to think,
that our crosses are the curses
of God, and that our afflictions
proceed from his finall anger,
neuer to bee appeased; but
these his sugiestions are false;
let vs not beleeue them: let vs
beleeue, that whom God doth

we may assure our selues so

we finde these tentations in vs:
for if we were his, as he would
sugiest vnto vs, that God is

he needed not to trouble vs:
but he knowing, that wee are

feare God, for the first, is to
feare him as a Slaue, that feares

               <p>Thou hast beene already

the sicke: <hi>Lazarus</hi> dyed,
and yet Christ said,<note place="margin">Ioh. 11. 4. 15.</note> that <hi>his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

vnto death, but that hee knew
hee could, and would raise him
againe, though hee were foure

dayes dead and buried. And
therefore was his sicknesse and
death, onely, that the glory of
God might be seene, by raising
of him; and the faith of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
be the more confirmed:
but we must impute our sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
and all other crosses, as
layde vpon vs for our sinnes;
and learne by the example of
good <hi>Hezekias,</hi> to turne our

not so much for our sicknesse as
for our sinnes.</p>
               <p>Thou therefore that art thus
afflicted, in body, and no doubt
in minde also; repayre vnto
God, in liuely, faithfull, and
earnest prayer, aboue all things
for the pardon of thy sinnes:<note place="margin">Prayer an argument of the child of God.</note>
for, prayer (if it be feruent) is the
most euident argument, that
thou art the childe of God, and
preuaileth much; for, where

true repentance: faith,
and repentance for sinne, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:20646:70"/>
God, are inseperable:
And if thy repentance be seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
it will either produce out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
teares,<note place="margin">The effects of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</note> or inward griefe
for your sinnes; though teares
be not alwayes ready, not ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball
prayers powerfull; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in a sick man, whose powres
are commonly so shaken, with
the force of the disease, as griefe
of the heart, can hardly wrest
teares from the eyes, or words
from the lips: yet, with God it
shall be accepted, both sufficient
prayers, and preuailing teares:
if thou finde such griefe in thy
heart for thy sinnes, and such a
desire to be reconciled vnto
God in Christ, as may but moue
inward, and silent sighes vnto
God, who respecteth more the
holy disposition of the heart,
then any outward action or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of the body; it shall bee
sufficient: though some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

be necessary, for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction

of such as visite a sicke

the tongue in speaking, though
weakely, confessing his sinnes,
lifting vp his hands, or eyes; it
may argue the inward heart wel
prepared, and that hee wanteth
not the spirit of God.</p>
               <p>And therefore if your sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
be so violent, as that you
cannot showe verball tokens of
the working of Gods spirit in
you, whereby they that come
to visite you, cannot witnesse
for you, your sorrow by your

that God knoweth it by your
inward true sorrow of heart.</p>
               <p>It was enough that God saw
that good King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> in his
sicknesse, inwardly bewayling
his sinnes, though hee could not
with plaine termes vocally, and
with fluent words, as hee was
wont; but inwardly, to <hi>mourne,

as a most earnest and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall

               <p>So that, if it come to passe,
that thy weakenesse become

               <p>To fall,<note place="margin">Easier to fall then to rise.</note> there are manie

to rise, being fallen, is not in man;

through idlenesse: many are
borne rich, and dye poore; and
many borne poore, waxe rich:
when the rich become poore,
it may be either in Gods iustice,
or in his mercy: for, if the rich
become proud, &amp; presume vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their wealth;<note place="margin">Riches and pouerty may both proceede of Gods mercie.</note> despising the
poore; it is iust with God, to
take that from him, that he abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth;
yet, also in mercie, to
humble him: for there is not a
more preuailing means, to make
a man know himselfe, then po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty;
And there is not a more
acceptable thing to God, then a
man to abase himselfe in his

then a man to exalt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
by reason of the greatnes
of his wealth; which he arroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
to himselfe, as if it were his
owne, when in deede it is but

often times takes it from one,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:20646:85"/>
and giues it to others: And in
steed of his wealth, giues him
want; that hee may know, that
it is neither in the wisedome, nor
by the diligence of man, either
to get or to retaine his wealth
gotten, without the meere mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and blessing of God.</p>
               <p>But, where true faith in God
is, ioyned with godly care and

there wanteth not prayer; And
where faith and faithfull pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are, there is true prosperity:
And to that man,<note place="margin">The ground of true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity.</note> a little meanes
sufficeth to sustaine his estate,

               <p>Consider this duly with thy

are the good &amp; gracious means,

be denied also, but that a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
poore man may haue his
heart infected, and poysoned,
with as haynous sinnes as the

it might do the childe. So riches

               <p>If thou that art become

seeing thou hast found out

to light; I doe appeale
from thy Throne of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
to thy Seate of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie:
for I doe confesse, that

I may find fauour: and
in the merits of Christ thy
beloued Sonne, I may yet
be saued, though my mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall

               <p>Thou hast power O
Lord, to worke the hearts
of the seuearest Iudges of

               <p>But aboue all earthly

in pardoning mine
vngodly deseruings, for
which I lye here, vnder
thine and the hand of the

must and I doe humbly

alas, what am I dust and

O! how can I thinke, that

many wayes transgressed

I might haue beene (as I

               <p>I doe acknowledge O

haue committed; and
therefore, were I innocent
in this, for which I am ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended

the attonement: and he it
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:20646:128"/>

whome I beleeue I shall
finde thee reconciled vnto

my body here (which is
the actiue part of all my

good in thine owne eyes:
for as one haire of the head

               <p>My life and my death

               <p>When I was free of this

walke, as I ought to haue

many good and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

commanded: which
brought me to necessitie;
necessitie inforced mee to

if they take it from mee,
but the weakest witnesse

thought by children, a meere

Parents are many times (as it

               <p>If this necessary Law were
