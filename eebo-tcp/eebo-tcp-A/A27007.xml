            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AD pag. 1. You ſay very well againſt catching at words, and ſurmiſing ſtrange Opinions: But if an excellent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will ſpeak ſtrange and dangerous words, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der muſt have an Antidote, and it is time enough to forgive the Writer when he confeſſeth the Errour of his words. He that ſpeaketh ill, and meaneth well, ſhould keep his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to himſelf till he can and will intelligibly expreſs it.</p>
            <p>To your pag 2. He were malignant that would not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge your Candour: And it is an encouragement to us that differ from you, that you believe our part in that Kingdom which it is not given us yet to ſee. And as you profeſs your patient bearing of Contradictions, we ſhould love each other the more for our likeneſs. Though I am noted to have too ſharp a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving ſtyle, I do profeſs that I can bear more than I uſe; yea, that I love Reproof and my Reprovers.</p>
            <p>To your pag. 3. And your confidence of your right Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Prophecies, and of the bleſſed 1697 year, I ſay but 1. As <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to the Prophets of his time<hi>—Amen.</hi> My wiſhes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company you further than my belief (but not to the unhappy end of your New Earth.) 2. And I know how natural it is for every man to be over-confident of his conceptions, and his way to be right in his own Eyes.</p>
            <p>To your pag. 4. The deſcription of your Conformity, and receſſes from it, is very modeſt and diſcreet. I named you not among Conformiſts as an Accuſer, but as excuſing the Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts, to whom your Millenary Opinion is by unrighteous men imputed, whiles it is Conformiſts that are its ſtrongeſt Pillars.</p>
            <p>But if it be not the Sacred Office that you diſclaim, but the bare name <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, are not thoſe Officers Chriſt's more ſpecial <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, though the Laity alſo are his common Lot. You love not, I hope, Controverſies about meer names and words: But if you do, let <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 17. ſilence you, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, yet <hi>Judas</hi> was not choſen by Lot as <hi>Matthias</hi> was.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:107961:3"/>
Tho' I know not what you mean by [ſetting up that in King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom counterfeit] nor how men ſhould underſtand that by [Semi-Sadduces of the Apoſtacy] you meant no body, but an Abſtract Thing; yet I underſtand and accept your Retracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Page 5. Your [bold avouching] ſpeaketh your confidence, but is no help to convince another, that a Kingdom of One day (1000 years) aſcribed to Chriſt, doth honour him more than an Endleſs Kingdom of Glory after two thouſand (or ſix thouſand) years Kingdom of Grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I thank you for diſclaiming the Doctrines which your words did favour: And intreat you that are ſo accurate in Prophecy, hereafter to be more accurate in your words, and to ſpeak as you think, and as you would have others think, that underſtand words according to common uſage.</p>
            <p>Pag. 6. Of your commendations of Dr. <hi>Criſpe</hi>'s Book, I think ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ill, that I have written a proper Anſwer to you about it, but ſtop the publiſhing of it, becauſe I find you ſo ready to retract. But I confeſs your commending to the World, a Book ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Chriſtianity it ſelf, doth much abate my reverence to your confidence in Prophecy.</p>
            <p>If ſuch as Dr. <hi>Criſpe</hi> and you have no ſafer and ſounder words to Preach Juſtification and Grace by, than to tell men how bad it is to think that ſin can poſſibly do them any hurt, or duty, or any thing they can do (Faith, Hope, Love, Obedience) do them any good, and to tell them that Chriſt is the greateſt hater of God, Murderer, Adulterer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the World, and that not only the puniſhment (and guilt of puniſhment) but the very ſins them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of all the Elect are Chriſt's own ſins; and that if men commit Murder, Adultery, Perjury, Treaſon, it is none of their ſin but Chriſt's, for it cannot be Chriſt's and theirs too; they are for all the acts, no Murderers, no Adulterers, no Traitors, no Haters of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſay, if this be your excellent Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt and his Kingdom, I ſhall not admire your Doctrine of the Kingdom; nor wonder if more of this Doctor's Diſciples be like that one, that would come drunk and kneel to prayer in in his Family, and cry, <hi>[Lord, all our righteouſneſs is not worth two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, no, Lord, it is not worth a half-penny.]</hi> And I hope hereafter you will ſpeak more intelligibly of our Juſtification only by God's Eſſential Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:107961:3"/>
To pag. 7, 8. The Kingdom of Grace, which you confeſs in not another, but the ſame that extendeth to the endleſs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Glory, by degrees deſtroying Sin and Curſe, and putting down Enemies, and by the Triumphant appearing of Chriſt at the Reſurrection finiſhing the Reign of Deliverance, Conqueſt and Acquiſition, and entring on the Reign of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and glorious Fruition: There being in Scripture no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that I can find of any Thouſand years between theſe two.</p>
            <p>I come to your four profeſſed Differences.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>That there is, beſides all the Kingly State of Chriſt wherein we are agreed, a diſtinct Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt as the great Son of Man, to the higheſt Noon tide Glory of which God hath aſſigned a Thouſand years: And when it hath utterly ſubdued all Enemies, it is to be delivered up to God, and the Father, and the Son, to be ſubject in that very ſenſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I have recited all your words, that I may be ſure that I leave not out the ſpecifick difference: But what it is I am ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the wiſer, nor know by theſe words. I had the unhappineſs from my Youth to be inclined to ſtrict definition and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and accurate Logical Explications, and to abhor confuſed Harangues; and therefore the (now deſpiſed) Schoolmen were my pleaſant ſtudy, next to the Bible and practical Divinity. But now I have lived to ſee that kind of ſtudy and diſputing derided, (which is far eaſier than learned) and to hear Diſputes about Terms unexplained; and the Queſtion debated in the beginning, and ſcarce ſtated in the end.</p>
            <p>Which of theſe words ſpecifie the middle Kingdom from the former and the latter? Or muſt it be none of the particulars, but all connext?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Is it the word <hi>[diſtinct?]</hi> That's but to beg the Queſtion, which is, whether there be any middle diſtinct Kingdom? And it tells us not what it is. A diſtinction in the exerciſe of adminiſtration between the beginning and reſignation we are agreed of.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is the difference in the word <hi>[The Great Son of Man?]</hi> Is he not the Great Son of Man before and after?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Is it in [the <hi>higheſt Noontide Glory?]</hi> Will it be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Glory after the Thouſand years?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Is it in the time of [1000 <hi>years?]</hi> Is the <hi>time</hi> the ſpecies of the Kingdom? And is a Thouſand years better than everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:107961:4"/>
5. Is it in <hi>[the ſubduing of all Enemies]</hi> Mean you <hi>in fieri,</hi> or <hi>in facto eſſe?</hi> If the firſt, Is he not ſubduing them now? Doth he not ſubdue them in every ſanctiſied Soul? and did he not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the Grand Pagan Roman Empire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If you mean <hi>in facto eſſe,</hi> as conſummate, then what needs a Thouſand years to do it, when the Reſurrection is the finiſhing of it?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Is the delivering up to the Father, the ſpecifying form? then it is not in being till it is paſt being. How can it be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up before it is in being? And then the previous King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Acquiſition and Conqueſt is the ſame, for that is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Father.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Is it <hi>[the Son's being ſubject in that very ſenſe?]</hi> Little know I what you mean by <hi>[that very ſenſe]</hi> But I know that the Son as Man was, and will be ſubject: In the former and the everlaſting Kingdom. And ſo here is not one ſyllable of the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick difference, but a harangue of words.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Taking</hi> of <hi>God's Name in vain,</hi> I beſeech you to fear it. To father a falſhood on God is dangerous. Suſpenſion is ſafer, where you ſay that to <hi>diminiſh is equally dangerous.]</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I do it not: I do not ſay, that God tells us that there is no ſuch Millenary Kingdom; but only that I can find no proof of any ſuch, and therefore tell you what hindereth me from your confident Opinion.</p>
            <p>To pag. 10. It's very true that you ſay, that there is needful a comprehenſive knowledge of the whole frame of Prophecy and Chronology to a clear Judgment of many hard points: But not to the ſuſpenſion of Judgment, nor to the confutation of every Errour.</p>
            <p>And I believe that you have ſtudied Chronology, and <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> more than I have done: But ſhould I enter into a diſpute with your pretended Scripture Chronology, and object againſt you, all that I find in <hi>Uſher, Helvicus, Petavius, Beroaldus, Joſ. Scaliger, Carion, Bucholzer, Functius, Gutberleth, Micrelius,</hi> Mr. <hi>Talents, &amp;c.</hi> how endleſs would be the diſpute? And yet muſt your Chronology and all its conſequents be taken for granted Truths?</p>
            <p n="3">3. You truly ſay, that our Infancy, that needs to be fed with Milk, maketh us leſs capable of theſe Myſteries. The Lord pity and teach us. But I muſt ſay, that the Miniſters and People that have moſt need of Milk, (but leaſt feel their need) are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107961:4"/>
moſt inclined to your Opinion in this point; excepting a few Learned men (Mr. <hi>Mead,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Moore, &amp;c.)</hi> whom he overcame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ad</hi> pag. 11. 1. Call it a diſtinct Kingdom, or a diſtinct part of the adminiſtration, as you pleaſe, we grant that the glorious appearance of Chriſt to Judgment is diſtinct from his inviſible Reign in Heaven. As the Aſſizes is a diſtinct exerciſe of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, and as Triumph is diſtinct from Conqueſt. As it is the Triumphant end of Chriſt's Conqueſts, and the beginning of his Rewarding Kingdom of Glory, it is oft ſpoken of in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But of what more I expect your proof.</p>
            <p>But here you pretend a deſcription of this Kingdom; but no other than before, <hi>ſine differentid ſpecificd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a Supreme Oeconomy; and was not that before and after Supreme?</p>
            <p n="2">2. It <hi>was towards the Family in Heaven and Earth.]</hi> So was that before and after.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It <hi>was in the fulneſs of all times.]</hi> Sure then it was after your Thouſand years.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It was by the <hi>Great Son of Man and Lamb.]</hi> So it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and will be after.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>Humanity ſhall have a Glory ſingular to it ſelf, as it had a Humiliation.]</hi> True, but not divided from the Godhead; and ſo it had before, and will have to eternity, as you confeſs.</p>
            <p>Is this Elucidation, or an informing way of an Inſtructor?</p>
            <p>But you ſay, The Rain-bow is a ſymbol of it.

If they were on Earth, were they raiſed before, or in, or after the burning? And how ſcap't their new bodies? The Paradiſe Saints have bodies of fleſh, paſſible, and ſuch as muſt have food: Sure all the raiſed wicked have not bodies leſs ſenſible, patible, or that need leſs food.</p>

And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The laſt ſhall be firſt, and the firſt laſt.</hi>

Is it more faulty in a <hi>Plato, Zeno,</hi> or other Pagans to conjecture at Tranſmigrations of Souls, revolutions of Worlds, or with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> to think the World was an eternal Effect of an eternal Cauſe: Or for a Chriſtian to ſay, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> and pawn God's Word for his erroneous conjectures.</p>
            <p>Your Arguments are too long and looſe for any Mood, and Figure, or Reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> I. <hi>King of Kings</hi> is a Title fit for a great Kingdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What then? <hi>Ergo</hi> it proveth a Middle Kingdom between that of Recovering Grace, and Reſurrection Glory.) I deny the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; no Kingdom is fitter for thoſe Titles than that of Grace and final Glory. This is not proving.</p>
            <p>It's falſe that Chriſt hath not yet been an Univerſal Monarch.</p>
            <p>Pag. 15. Your 2d Argument (as the reſt) is but a repeating of your own formally confuted Opinions, without any reply to the Confutation, as if you had nothing to do, but aſſert again what you think.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24. Is your proof, <hi>Then cometh the end?</hi> And is the Thouſand years the end, and not the Glorious Kingdom of frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Judgment will end by Triumph the Kingdom of Acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But the eternal Kingdom will be the laſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Your denial of a <hi>Diſtinct Glory of Chriſt's Humanity before and after the Thouſand years,</hi> is certainly untrue. If the Divine and Humane Nature be diſtinct, the Glory of each muſt needs be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, tho' not divided. VVhy obtrude you groſs things unproved?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Your intimation that <hi>[God doth then begin to be All in All, and Chriſt to be Subject, in ſome ſpecial ſenſe,</hi> hath no proof from the Text, nor if proved is it any thing for your purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Text ſpeaks of no ſuch beginning: But that though Chriſt hath done his Conquering work, yet <hi>ſtill God ſhall be All in All things, as he was.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Yet we grant that it ſpeaks of Chriſt's ending his Kingdom of Conqueſt and Acquiſition, and the Deity now Governing Man as reſtored, not needing any more recovery. I oft tell you, as the King's Son made General to reduce Rebels, giveth up his Generalſhip when he hath reduced them, but hath after the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed honour and reward, but as a Subject ſtill, &amp; not a Captain.</p>
            <p>Pag. 16. You ſay, that our Expoſition chargeth on the Apoſtle <hi>[Impropriety of ſpeech]</hi> but you do but ſay ſo, and we deny it. Is it not proper ſpeech to ſay, that a General giveth up his Office,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107961:6"/>
and yet remaineth an honoured, rewarded Subject Ruler?] In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, had it been as you feign it, ſaid <hi>[to become ſubject]</hi> it would have ſeemed to ſignifie, that he then began to be ſubject: But that's your addition; &amp; yet you before confeſt that he was ſubject before.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I told you <hi>Diſtinguiſhing</hi> is not <hi>Separating.</hi> And I told you wherein the difference conſiſteth, which you confute not.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To your 2d Reaſon, I find no ſuch Scripture as you talk of, that mentioneth any middle Kingdom, but a Triumphant Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment perfecting the Kingdom of Grace, and beginning that of End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Glory. The <hi>admirable agreement</hi> which you mention ſeemeth to me to be but an agreement of <hi>your conceit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your 3d Argument from <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 29, 30. ſaith nothing of a third Kingdom: All that is there ſaid ſeemeth to me fulfilled without a third.</p>
            <p>Pag. 17. Is not that you plead for [of the <hi>Humane Nature as united to the Eternal Word?]</hi> How can it elſe be any Kingdom of Chriſt? But both that of Grace and Glory are ſuch; but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Relation of <hi>Mediatorſhip.</hi> By <hi>[Conſtituted]</hi> I ſuppoſe you mean, not eſſential to the nature or perſon, without reſpect to the Office as the product of God's VVill: And ſuch is the <hi>Everlaſting</hi> Kingdom. It is the Reign of the Man Jeſus united to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, as Mediator of Acquiſition firſt, and then of <hi>Fruition,</hi> and this over creatures. I fear it is dangerouſly untrue therefore that you ſay, <hi>That the Kingdom of the Humane Nature is united to the Eternal Word, and communicating with it, is an Eſſential, and not a Conſtitutive Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eſſential</hi> to what? Is the <hi>Humane Nature, and a World of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures eſſential to God?</hi> It is eſſential to it <hi>ſelf;</hi> that is, it is what it is. But can you prove that the Humane Nature was, or ſhall ever be united to the Deity, without its Relation of Mediator? It is Chriſt's will, that <hi>thoſe given him be with him, and ſee his Glory:</hi> And that ſight is of the Mediator of <hi>Fruition;</hi> and did he limit that ſight to a Thouſand years?</p>
            <p>To your 2d. 1. You have not proved that the Apoſtles yet ſit not on Thrones of Judgment: They are equal with Angels.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If yet they do not, may it not be at Judgment, and in the Kingdom of Glory?</p>

            <p>From <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 26, 27. One would think that it ſhould be a good Argument that Chriſt ſhall have one Kingdom, that was firſt obſcured by fleſh's weakneſs, after come in viſible Power to Judgment, and paſs into Glory, becauſe ſome then alive ſhould ſee the pledge and appearance of it. But you hence gather, that becauſe men ſhall ſee the appearance of his heavenly Glorious Reign, therefore he ſhall have none of that Reign in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Grace or Endleſs Glory, but in a third and middle King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; ſuch Collections expound your <hi>ſelf,</hi> more than the <hi>Text.</hi>

            <p>As ſoon as Chriſt aſcended to Heaven, he was poſſeſt of the Kingdom of Power, ſeen in the Mount, and not only at the Millennium.</p>
            <p>P. 20. <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. You fetch your moſt concluſive Argument from the one ſingle note by which the Spirit of God hath fixed the beginning of this Kingdom, that is, <hi>The ſubduing of Enemies]</hi> where your fantaſie maketh two degrees. 1. The <hi>making of Chriſt's Enemies his footſtool.</hi> And 2. <hi>Putting them Low under his feet.</hi> As if his <hi>footſtool</hi> were not <hi>low and under his feet.</hi> Can you prove that Scripture mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this as two States, and that at 1000 years diſtance? Yes, you ſay <hi>the ſecond is to bring them to the ſtate of no motion or action:</hi> And yet are they <hi>haters of God,</hi> and have they a <hi>ſelf-tormenting Conſcience,</hi> and when looſed are <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog;</hi> and <hi>aſſault the holy City;</hi> and yet have no <hi>motion</hi> or <hi>action?</hi> I ſuppoſe that in your next you will ſay you <hi>meant well,</hi> and not that they were made dead blocks or annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated; but you ſhould ſpeak as you think, or ſay that you think as you ſpeak. It will comfort the wicked to hope that they ſhall have only the puniſhment of Loſs as dead inſenſible carkaſſes. You have many paſſages of this ſound.</p>
            <p>Pag. 21. You groſly pervert <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 1. God ſaith not, <hi>Sit thou without Reigning at my right hand, till I all at once, or at the laſt make thine Enemies thy footſtool.</hi> He ſaith not, <hi>Sit without Reigning, and Reign only at thy laſt coming:</hi> But <hi>ſit</hi> next me in Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling dignity while I am making thine Enemies thy footſtool, which at laſt ſhall be perfected: What word ſaith as you; <hi>I intend thee a Great and diſtinct Kingdom (of one days length) the date of its beginning ſhall not be at thy Aſcenſion,</hi> &amp;c?] Did not God make the Pagan Empire his footſtool, and ſubdue Sin and Satan, till the day of Judgment? It is enough that all will be then finiſhed and the Kingdom of Glory begun. <hi>[He ſits and doth not Reign]</hi> is your fiction againſt full Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>We ſee them not put under him]</hi> can mean but <hi>[We ſee not that ſubjection perfected.]</hi> But we do ſee them put under him in a great degree. <hi>The Lord reigneth; Let the people rejoice.</hi> The Kingdoms of the World are made the Kingdoms of the Lord and of his Chriſt before the day of Judgment.</p>
            <p>If we ſee not <hi>all things put under him,</hi> do we ſee nothing ſo put? When Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment puts all things under him, what need a Thouſand years do it?</p>

P. 23. It's a great diſparagement to your Cauſe, to lay your chief ſtreſs on this Text: As if it were not fulfilled by Chriſt many 100 or 1000 years treading down Sin, Satan, and Empire of Enemies, and triumphing over them at his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious appearing, and Reigning for ever for that Conqueſt in Glory, unleſs he be a Thouſand years more between in Coquering them.</p>
            <p>As to 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. I askt you before whether you feel no reluctancy in ſo groſs an abuſe of that Text that ſpeaketh of 1000 delay being before Chriſt's coming, as if it ſpake of 1000 years after. Pardon the Queſtion: The Cauſe requireth it.</p>
            <p>P. 34. You have but one Text in all the Bible that ſpeaks of 1000 years to give you the leaſt ſhew of Countenance; and that in Prophetick Language: And can you <hi>not ſtay on the mentioning of it?</hi> What elſe ſhould all your Book have been, but your clearing of this one Text? You promiſe to prove abundantly that it cannot poſſibly be underſtood of any time paſt: But I ſee no hope of your performance.</p>

            <p>But you have fitted the reſt of your Expoſition of the <hi>Revelations</hi> to your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the 1000 years, and then you think that fitneſs proveth all your Point But if I ſhew that all theſe Texts were performed on Pagan <hi>Rome,</hi> it is not your finding Papal <hi>Rome</hi> to be like it, that will juſtifie your ſenſe.</p>
            <p>It were an impertinent work to ſhew here that the <hi>Revelation</hi> hath a far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſenſe, from what you give it.</p>
            <p>Pag. 27. Your 2d Point therefore is of another Controverſie, which this in hand depends not on; unleſs you confeſs that you have no other proof of the Thouſand years Kingdom, but <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. and that it was not fulfilled heretofore. I am paſt doubt that Pagan <hi>Rome</hi> was <hi>Babylon</hi> mentioned in <hi>Rev.</hi> But whether Papal <hi>Rome</hi> be another <hi>Babylon,</hi> I leave to enquiry: But if all your Cauſe lie on that one Text, I think it hath no good foundation.

            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. 1. The Text ſpeaketh of the <hi>Old Earth</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> flying away, and you feign it to ſpeak of the <hi>New.</hi> 2.

If we be not the <hi>bigheſt</hi> creatures, why ſhould we think that we have not need of higher? Is all our promiſed Comfort in Communion with the Angels, Saints, and Chriſt's Humanity <hi>objectively</hi> confined to a Thouſand years?</p>
            <p>Pag. 41. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. How prove you that <hi>God's everlaſting Communication to Humane Nature is not as free as the reſt, ſeeing he freely created and continueth Humane Nature?</hi>

            <p>Chriſt's Humane Nature and ours, had no Glory with the Father before any World began. For that which exiſted not had no Glory.</p>

            <p>Your Reaſons are formerly anſwered.</p>
            <p>Pag. 44. Prop. 5. <hi>Lot</hi> was <hi>carried out of</hi> Sodom, but you hold that the <hi>Living ſhall be in the fire, and not caught out:</hi> That they <hi>ſhall be in it unburnt,</hi> you do not prove. <hi>Peter</hi> doth not ſpeak of keeping them in the fire unburnt.</p>
            <p>Pag. 45. If the <hi>Saints changed</hi> are to be numbred with the <hi>Children of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,</hi> they neither <hi>marry, nor are given in marriage.</hi> And you ſay, <hi>They both make but one New Jeruſalem.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Prop. 8. I have proved that the <hi>taking up</hi> is at the <hi>ſound of the Trumpet,</hi> which is the time of the Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>Pag. 46. <hi>If all be One Reſurrection,</hi> then thoſe in Paradiſe are <hi>Children of the Reſurrection,</hi> and marry not.</p>

            <p>In the concluſion to all my former Queſtions, I deſire your Anſwer to theſe few more added;</p>
            <p>Q. 1. Seeing pag. 5. <hi>Tou dare not think of any World before that,</hi> Gen. 1. <hi>nor after the Kingdom given up, &amp;c.</hi> what mean you by the <hi>Eternal Kingdom,</hi> when there are no Eternal Subjects?</p>

Q. 2. If it be <hi>all the wicked that died before the Trumpet,</hi> that are <hi>Raiſed, and after aſſault the New Jeruſalem,</hi> have they not moſtly been <hi>bound</hi> many Thouſand years already, in that they aſſault us no more, unleſs you take them to be the Devils that tempt us?</p>
            <p>Q. 3. Will their puniſhment all the Thouſand years be ſo eaſie as to allow them to cover the Earth &amp; ſight againſt the Saints? and will it no more convince them?</p>
            <p>Q. 4. What became of their Bodies in the Conflagration?</p>
            <p>Q. 5. And of the Bodies of all the living wicked?</p>
            <p>Q. 6. And of their Souls that lived then in wickedneſs?</p>
            <p>Q. 7. Seeing you take <hi>Philadelphia</hi> to be the New Earth in its purity, before its fall, can you believe that in that World, there is but a <hi>little ſtrength,</hi> and that there is a <hi>Synagogue of Satan called Jews, that muſt come and worſhip before their feet?</hi> And that <hi>Philadelphia</hi> after the fire, is yet to be <hi>kept from an hour of temptation that ſhall come on all the World, to try them that dwell on the Earth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q 8. Doth the New Paradiſe World hear, <hi>Behold I come quickly hold faſt, &amp;c</hi> after Chriſt is come?</p>
            <p>Q. 9. Seeing <hi>Laodicea</hi> is alſo with you the New Earth and Paradiſe State, is that indeed a <hi>Changed State, and World of Righteouſneſs</hi> in which the <hi>New Jeruſalem is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hot nor cold, and to be ſpewed out, and is wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked, and knoweth it not,</hi> but ſaith, <hi>I want nothing,</hi> and is yet <hi>counſelled to buy, and cover her ſhame, &amp;c.</hi> Is that World no better than ſo?</p>
            <p>Q. 10. Doth God <hi>reward all men according to their works,</hi> if the <hi>Beſt Saints</hi> found <hi>alive</hi> are for a thouſand years in no better a World, and the <hi>Worſt Saints</hi> that were <hi>dead</hi> ſince <hi>Abel</hi> till Chriſt's coming, are in a ſpiritual higher Body and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion all that Thouſand years? Is this God's Word?</p>
            <p>Q. 11. Did any of the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches, or any Chriſtians for 1300 years at leaſt (or 1500) believe that the five firſt Epiſtles were written to men of <hi>this World,</hi> and the two laſt to the men of the <hi>World to come after the Earth</hi> (and Bibles) are burnt?</p>
            <p>Q. 12. Conſider whether you that ſo zealouſly cry down the Papal Antichriſt and <hi>Babylon,</hi> do not ignorantly <hi>maintain the Papal State</hi> which you call <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian?</hi> What is the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of <hi>Papacy,</hi> but the claim of an <hi>Univerſal Power</hi> over the <hi>Church,</hi> in the Pope, or his Counſel, he being the Head. And do not you maintain that the Seven Churches are Seven States of the Church Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal? And almoſt all Expoſitors agree that by the <hi>Angel</hi> is meant the Biſhop, at leaſt, as <hi>Biza</hi> ſaith, the <hi>Proeſtos</hi> with his Elders: And have even the <hi>Two Churches of the World to come</hi> ſuch an <hi>Univerſal Government?</hi> Sure then it is of <hi>Divine Inſtitution</hi> that <hi>ſuch there be:</hi> And who claimeth it but the Pope and Councils? This is the Effect of over-doing Zeal.</p>
            <p>For my part, if I believed that by God's Inſtitution the Church Catholick muſt have one Univerſal Humane Angel or Government, Monarchical or Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocratical, or mixt, I would preſently be a Papiſt.</p>
            <p>Sir; If any words in this Paper are diſpleaſing to you for their freedom, be aſſured it is to your Words and Cauſe, and not for want of Love and great Eſteem of your Perſon; who as you are by Birth above me (the Son of a Godly Knight) <hi>ſo from my heart I believe that you are a far better man than my ſelf.</hi> And though I think you over-confident of your Apprehenſions, I love you the better while I think, How ſtrong a Faith hath that good man of God's Word in general, who is ſo confident in every hard particular.

            <p>§ 1. I Underſtand that on further thoughts, ſome men that are further from me, than Mr. <hi>Beverly,</hi> are like by his Book, to be much confirmed againſt Chriſtianity. Their Judgment of Chriſt is much like the Turks, That there is <hi>One God,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus</hi> is one of his three great Legiſlator-Prophets, and to be called his Son, becauſe of his miraculous Generation: But that as Incarnate and the Son of Man he hath but a Temporal Kingdom, and <hi>that Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> ſhall at the end of the Thouſand years be put off, and with the Kingdom delivered up to the Father, ſhall ceaſe; and that God's being <hi>All in All</hi> implieth this ceſſation.</p>
            <p>Becauſe Mr. <hi>Beverley</hi> taketh himſelf not accountable for other mens Errours, and ſeemeth himſelf to renounce all ſuch, I will ſpeak to them my ſelf, (and to him on the by,) firſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring him to have ſo much charity to ſuch men, as to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them by explaining theſe few particulars of his.</p>
            <p>§ 2. 1. To tell them what he meaneth by his diſtinction of <hi>Chriſt's Nature and Kingdom as Man in our Nature, and his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Kingdom as the Son of Man,</hi> which he thinks ends with the Millennium. To tell them what he meaneth by <hi>Chriſt's Humane Nature</hi> before the <hi>Incarnation.</hi> If it be the <hi>Natura Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talis in genere,</hi> is it not as much an Angelical Nature as a Humane? And he was not <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Anointed Saviour from Eternity, nor before he was here Incarnate of <hi>Mary.</hi> If his Body and Humane Soul then received, die or ceaſe, then Jeſus Chriſt dieth or ceaſeth, though the Mental Nature Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane or Angelical ceaſe not: Leave us not to the equivocal of a continued <hi>[Humane</hi> or <hi>our Nature]</hi> while you diſtinguiſh <hi>[Chriſt Man]</hi> from <hi>[Chriſt the Son of Man]</hi> But tell us whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be only a Spiritual Mentality, ſuperangelical, or the Soul and Body of a Man at his Incarnation. If it be the <hi>Anima Mundi,</hi> is it not the <hi>Common Nature of all things?</hi>

2. To tell them yet what he meaneth by the <hi>Kingdom of Eternity</hi> as diſtinct from the <hi>Thouſand years</hi> Kingdom; ſeeing he denieth that there were <hi>any Subjects,</hi> or <hi>Creatures</hi> from <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> what is that <hi>Kingdom</hi> that hath <hi>no Subjects,</hi> nor <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> If he mean only <hi>[To Eternity,]</hi> of that anon.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To tell us alſo how it can be that Chriſt ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in our Nature, and yet be <hi>no Object</hi> of our Souls, but only a Conveying Medium.</p>
            <p>§ 3. Now I deſire both him and theſe others that miſuſe him, to conſider as followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Is there any Scripture that ſaith, that Chriſt had <hi>two Humane Natures?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Ceſſation</hi> is no leſs than <hi>Death,</hi> or <hi>Tranſmutation</hi> into ſome other Nature. If Chriſt's <hi>Incarnate Humanity Die,</hi> how is he called <hi>Immortal, Eternal,</hi> and ſaid to <hi>bring Life and Immortality to light, his Kingdom to have no end,</hi> as the <hi>ſlain Lamb,</hi> to be <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>alive</hi> for <hi>evermore; to have the power or Keys of Life, and Death, and Hell,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If it be <hi>Tranſmutation,</hi> it is either of his <hi>Humane, Specifick Form:</hi> And then into <hi>what other</hi> Form, Nature or Being is he changed? It is but the perfecting of the Humane Form which he had, by turning corruptible fleſh and blood into a ſpiritual glorious body: And this was done before at his Aſcenſion. And this we deny not, to be eternal as to come. If this be your <hi>ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing up.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. If <hi>we</hi> ſhall have the <hi>ſame</hi> Humane Nature <hi>[in ſpecie</hi> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualized and glorified after the Thouſand years that we had before, ſo ſhall Chriſt; for he <hi>will make our Vile Bodies like to his Glorious Body.</hi> But many Promiſes aſſure us of ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance: Elſe we ſhall be no <hi>Men,</hi> but <hi>Nothing,</hi> or ſome thing of another <hi>ſpecies.</hi> And Chriſt calleth us <hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. If Chriſt will be the <hi>Head</hi> of the Glorified Church after the Thouſand years, then certainly there will be a Unity of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, and an everlaſting Communion both as with a <hi>Cauſe Efficient, Objective</hi> and <hi>Final.</hi> And it cannot be true which you ſay (and the Infidels will take hold of) that Chriſt as Man in our Nature will not be an Object (even of Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For we ſhall ſtill be Individual Members of a Political Body: And ſhall we have a <hi>Head,</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> and not <hi>Know</hi>

               <hi>him,</hi> and not <hi>Love him,</hi> and not <hi>Praiſe</hi> or <hi>Honour him?</hi> Shall the Saints <hi>praiſes of the Lamb,</hi> that <hi>Redeemed them,</hi> ceaſe then for ever? Shall we all then ceaſe to be <hi>Kings and Prieſts, and to ſit with him on his Throne, and to ſing the ſong of the Lamb, and to ſee him as he is, and face to face, and to behold his Glory given him as Man?</hi> Is he in all this <hi>no Object?</hi> And how oft doth Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture make him the <hi>Final Object</hi> under the <hi>finis ultimatè ultimus,</hi> as he is to be glorified? Shall an <hi>Intelligent Head</hi> and <hi>Members</hi> live together, and neither <hi>know,</hi> nor <hi>love,</hi> nor <hi>rejoice in each other?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. Shall the whole Heavenly City, Society and Chore, be diſſolved for ever? If ſo, do not the Mahometans hope for a better felicity than ſuch, who think <hi>Mahomet</hi> will for lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time than a Thouſand years give them their deſires, and that his Kingdom ſhall not end by being ſpewed out finally in everlaſting diſgrace?</p>
            <p>But if the Body and City continue, ſo will the Head and King. And will Chriſt's Incarnate Humanity ſpiritualized be for ever uſeleſs? Will he live for nothing? Heaven and Angels will not be uſeleſs: God ſhall ſhine in them, and we ſhall ſee that light. Shall it be our joy to ſit with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and to enter into the Joy of our Lord, and this all ceaſe, and the Deity only be an Object after a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years? O ſhort everlaſtingneſs!</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Open your Eyes, and ſee your Contradiction, that think Chriſt's Kingdom (as the Son of Man) ſhall for ever ceaſe, and yet that Chriſt ſhall be <hi>ſubject to the Father.</hi> Shall he be <hi>ſubject</hi> as <hi>God,</hi> or as <hi>Man?</hi> Not <hi>as God,</hi> for <hi>God</hi> is <hi>not ſubject</hi> to himſelf: If as the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> then <hi>that Manhood</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth in being: And doubtleſs in a <hi>Glorious Objective</hi> and <hi>Effective</hi> Being.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. But ſpeaking to men inclined to believe that Chriſt ſhall be <hi>no Chriſt</hi> after the Thouſand years, I will deal with them according to their Principles; and argue from <hi>Natural Order,</hi> and from <hi>Oeconomical</hi> or <hi>Inſtituted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do you not believe that God hath <hi>Creatures</hi> of divers ranks, ſome above others in excellency and cauſality? No wonder that he that believeth not <hi>any Creatures continuance,</hi> believeth not <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s: Or he that believeth not that one is above others in <hi>operation,</hi> believeth not the continuance of Chriſt's Power.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107961:11"/>
Do you think that God worketh by <hi>any ſecond Cauſes</hi> (though he be himſelf never the further from the Effect, nor leſs in the Cauſality?) Doth he not enlighten, warm and quicken earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Creatures by the <hi>Sun?</hi> and govern <hi>Men</hi> by <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> by <hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>Beaſts</hi> by <hi>Men?</hi> Certainly if the <hi>World</hi> ceaſe not, this Natural Order of Creatures and Cauſes will not ceaſe. None but mad-men, I think, will doubt that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Devils have Rule and Inferiority.</p>
            <p>And if ſo, after the Thouſand years <hi>ſome prime Creature</hi> muſt be a <hi>Superior Cauſe</hi> of operation to the reſt, and that according to the <hi>Nature</hi> of each, and therefore <hi>to Man,</hi> that is, <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual, Volitive, Affectionate</hi> and <hi>Active.</hi> And what Creature is this? Why may you not grant it to Chriſt, as well as to any other? Will you ſay with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> It is the firſt or higheſt Orb? That Orb then muſt be a Spirit: And what Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt the Firſt and Laſt? If his Humanity ceaſe, ſhall <hi>Angels</hi> ceaſe too? Or ſhall they be advanced ſo far above <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a <hi>Creature,</hi> as to Reign under God for ever when Chriſt is depoſed or extinct?</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>He is not depoſed, but his Created Nature will be ſwallowed up in the Deity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Intelligible ſenſe is ſwallowed up in ſuch inſignificant Metaphors. Is the Humane Nature turned into the Divine, and a Creature made the Godhead it ſelf? If not, what can you mean but <hi>Extinction</hi> or <hi>Annihilation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But there was no uſe for a Mediator before the Fall, and and there will be none after.</hi>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> There was no uſe for his <hi>Recovering Government;</hi> and there will be none in perfect Glory: But there will be uſe for Chriſt's and his Body's glorious Fruition, and felicitating work, as the ſtate of Reward: There was no uſe for us before we had our Being; and yet we may have everlaſting life.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But the Kingdom it ſelf, and not only the</hi> Modus Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendi, <hi>will be given up, and Chriſt Subject and God all in all. And you ſay, the Kingdom continueth, and make two Kingdoms, when Scripture maketh but one.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Is the Queſtion <hi>de Nomine,</hi> or <hi>de Re?</hi> If <hi>de Nomine</hi> only, take your liberty to call it <hi>One,</hi> or <hi>Two,</hi> or <hi>Three:</hi> If <hi>de Re,</hi> are not theſe <hi>real differences?</hi> 1. <hi>Between</hi> the <hi>Genus</hi> or <hi>Species Superior,</hi> and the <hi>Species Inferior</hi> or <hi>Specialiſſima:</hi> For in

            <p>What is it then that you would have? Is it that Chriſt as a Creature ſhall ceaſe? Or that he ſhall have no power under the Deity? Who ſhall have it then? Doth not Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſet him above Angels? Are they not his Miniſters? What Creature ſhall be over Chriſt? To ſay, There ſhall be no Kingdom, is to ſay, There ſhall be no God. To ſay, There ſhall be no Government under God as ſecond Cauſes, is to ſay, There ſhall be no World.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Becauſe Scripture and all Divines do ſo. <hi>The Kingdom is taken from the Jews, and given to another Nation. The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the World are become the Kingdoms of Chriſt]</hi> And many ſuch Texts, ſpeak not of the Kingdom of endleſs glory.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But after the Reſurrection and Thouſand years there will be no Legiſlation, no Judgment, no Execution; therefore no King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> You may as well ſay, <hi>[No Kingdom of God,]</hi> for you infer that or nothing. But a <hi>Law</hi> is nothing but the <hi>notification of the Rulers will to the Subject:</hi> And will not God make it our <hi>Duty</hi> to <hi>love</hi> and <hi>praiſe him? His face, yea and the face of Chriſt,</hi> will be a <hi>Law,</hi> or <hi>notification of our duty.</hi> Cannot God go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern us by a <hi>perfect Law of Nature</hi> and <hi>Intuition?</hi> Shall we <hi>ſee God,</hi> and not <hi>know his Will?</hi> Yea, have <hi>Angels</hi> now ſo much work to do, rejoyce over men, and <hi>Saints ſhall judge the World,</hi> and ſhall we for ever have <hi>no work of Obedience, Love, Joy or Praiſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there will be <hi>Executive Judgment</hi> of <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments</hi> for ever. The Rebels will not be annihilated: <hi>Their Worm dieth not.</hi> And it is Chriſt the <hi>Lamb</hi> that is ſaid to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy</hi> them, and to bleſs the juſt. And this as <hi>Believers in Chriſt</hi> or <hi>Unbelievers,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 6, 9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:107961:12"/>
It is the ſad caſe of the Church, that even ſtudious Miniſters muſt have new Books written, to anſwer every doubt that ariſeth to them, and cannot anſwer them themſelves.</p>
            <p>I conclude, that 1. Theſe men teach the Mahometans to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie Chriſt's <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and conſequently the <hi>King himſelf,</hi> as if when the <hi>ſinful Kingdom</hi> laſteth about ſix thouſand years, Chriſt's <hi>Glorious Sabbatical Kingdom</hi> ſhall laſt but <hi>one,</hi> and then for ever be <hi>ſpewed</hi> out with <hi>loathing</hi> as neither <hi>hot nor cold,</hi> but <hi>naked and miſerable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That they tempt men to <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> and to take either the <hi>Stoicks Revolutions,</hi> or <hi>Ariſtotle's Eternity of the World</hi> as an Eternal Body and Effect of an Eternal Cauſe, to be better than the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>And did I expound <hi>[Delivering up the Kingdom]</hi> as groſly as they; I would rather fall into <hi>Peter Sterry's</hi> way, that <hi>Chriſt hath three Natures, The Divine uniting it ſelf to the firſt and nobleſt Creature;</hi> and that <hi>prime Created Nature</hi> aſſuming the <hi>Humanity,</hi> and ſo <hi>ex Ordine Naturae</hi> as <hi>ſuperangelical,</hi> and <hi>ex Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine Liberae Inſtitutionis,</hi> retaining the Humanity glorified by way of Reward, Ruling the World as the higheſt ſubordinate created Cauſe. I confeſs this would ſeem to accommodate us in expounding <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to reconcile the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> to the Orthodox, if not to reconcile us to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and them that think it unlikely, that God who now delighteth in his Creatures, ſhould have none from and to eternity, but Himſelf? if Chriſt had a middle created ſuperangelical Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from. But we muſt not make Doctrines to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate us in our difficulties, eſpecially ſuch as the Church never commonly received. (Though I will not undertake to confute it.) But if I ſhould grant this Doctrine (that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eternal <hi>Word,</hi> produced creatures in different Order, and produced the higheſt creature ſo as to <hi>Unite</hi> it ſelf to it emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently as that by which he would make, or at leaſt operate on the Inferiour; and that this prime Creature at leaſt was God's Eternal Effect, and that this is either the <hi>Natura Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talis in Genere,</hi> comprehending that of Angels and Men, or ſome higher Nature above both, and that the Word in this Nature united was it that appeared to <hi>Abraham, Moſes,</hi> &amp;c. and after to Redeem Man aſſumed the Soul and Body of Man as a third Nature, by ſuch an Hypoſtatical Union, as I have deſcribed,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107961:12"/>
               <hi>cap.</hi> 3. in <hi>End of Controverſies.]</hi> I ſay, ſhould I grant them all this, I would never grant them againſt plain Scripture, that Chriſt's third Nature here received, dieth or ceaſeth after the Thouſand years, or that he continueth it Glorified to no uſe active or objective, and that he will not ſtill be the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of Fruition.</p>
            <p>Nor ſhall I believe that we Men (no nor Angels) ſhall have no Exiſtent Nature to Eternity, but what we had from <hi>Eternity</hi> in duration.</p>
            <p>Or if their laſt Argument would hold, that <hi>[eternal,</hi> and <hi>everlaſting,</hi> and <hi>for ever</hi> and <hi>without End]</hi> in the Promiſe, did mean but <hi>[a long time]</hi> as it doth oft in the Old Teſtament, I ſhould leave this long time as known only to God (and all that ſhould follow;) and not confine it, and all Chriſt's Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reign in Glory, to a Thouſand years, upon ſo uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding an Evidence, as one only obſcure Text, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. which may clearly be proved to have no ſuch ſenſe.</p>
            <p>The Lord inlighten us.</p>
