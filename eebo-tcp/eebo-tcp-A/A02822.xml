            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Whereas this heere is meerely of an other kind, not copied forth, or lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally extracted from any Precedent of her Life, but drawne and deriued from the golden Mines of the approued Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues of Saints, as <hi>Surius,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Basil Santor,</hi> in his Booke entituled <hi>Pratum Spirituale,</hi> who both, had borrowed the same from <hi>Iacobus Montanus</hi> of the citty of <hi>Spire</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> not wel to be contradicted.</p>
            <p>Behold the foundation of the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; as for the lineaments which are nothing substantiall to the matter, they stand rather as orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts thereof, and proceede from the liberty of him, who assumes so much vpon himself, to embellish and couer the nakednes of a bare Narration, which breedes but a loathing and tedious fastidious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the Reader: These I say are
<pb facs="tcp:4116:5"/>
stroakes of my pencel to highten and adorne it or els borrowed from the rudiments of some Maisters of spirit; to edify withall; which, next to the liuely example of the Saint, is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary scope I ayme at in this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke: Being otherwise a pious story, and of it self powerfull to excite the will, and moue deuotion to the Saint; On which (as I sayd) I haue layd some colours, as a Limmer on a simple cutt of black and white.</p>
            <p>This haue I said to let thee see, <hi>freindly Reader,</hi> my sincerity in this point, and to winne a confidence in thee towardes mee. Whereas indeed, as it is not the custome in the Exchequer to peize so scrupulously each light peece of siluer, to find whether it be weight or no; but to passe them togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the other peeces of more weight, currant with the rest. And as in traffique and commerce it were too importune, to be still calling for scales for euery single penny; so is it likewise in handling the pen, to be put to the iustify<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ng of euery litle thing
<pb facs="tcp:4116:5"/>
which makes not much to the purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se whether true or false. It is only in dauncing the cinque pace and measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, that men stand numbring their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and not in performing of long voyages.</p>
            <p>True resemblance as the Daughter of Truth, &amp; coniecture the Daughter of true resembla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, being al as Grandmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Mother, &amp; Daughter, haue great sympathyes and powerfull correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencyes with each other. So as if ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant impossibility, absurdity, or extreame vnlikelyhoods cause not a breach, there will appeare a goodly harmony amongst them. And truly wee should bee too precize, to set downe a List here of all the scruples that might be made of trifling exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions in this kind, by such as are cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and curious censurers of things indifferent; who haue their eyes filled with a noxious humour, that makes them behold al things of the colour the defluxion is. Who should doe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like those, that listen to a Lute, with a iudicious eare, that meeting by
<pb facs="tcp:4116:6"/>
chaunce, with some light touch or other, scarce sensible, among a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of better stroakes, through the prompt volubility of the Lutenests hand in running his diuisions, dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the same and reflect on the rest, which loose not their grace awhit for so light a fault, and hold such slurrs as ornaments, rather to the rest, and as moles in a beautifull face, which grace the same.</p>
            <p>Thus, <hi>gentle Reader,</hi> you haue the full satisfaction I can giue you heerin: This only I must needes admonish you, that you bee not troubled, when you meete with another Treatise of this <hi>Saint,</hi> more curiously and elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly written by a neater quill, but to accompt the same as it is; an Abstract rather of her Life directed to a noble Lady, and consequently most apt for such, who likely affoard not leysure to attend to treatises of greater bulke. Whereas this same here is meant for all, and intended as I sayd, as a model and patterne of the three states &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Women lyuing in the world:
<pb facs="tcp:4116:6"/>
While here if they be Virgins, they shal find very notable Examples in her life, being a Virgin: If Wiues, they may see how to carry themselues, and to leade a life meritoriously with their husbands: if Widowes they may lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne by her to contemne the vanityes of the world, and if they be Ladyes and Princesses, they may behold how great a Lady shee was, notwithstanding her so great annihilation of her self, as shall appeare in the Treatise. Shee being the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Hungary,</hi> a mighty Monarchy, Dutches, and wife of the <hi>Lantgraue</hi> of <hi>Thuringia,</hi> and Princesse of <hi>Hassia,</hi> Protectresse, and Patronesse of the Nunnes and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious of the third Order of the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of <hi>S.

yeare, after his recall: And <hi>Andrew</hi> Cozin of <hi>S. Stephen</hi> aduanced to the Throne after him, who reesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished the Christian Religion in Hungary, and reedifyed the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which had been demolished. After which, <hi>Andrew,</hi> by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposition of thirteene kings suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding one an other in the same Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, a second <hi>Andrew</hi> entred into the Throne, not a whit infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the former; but in valour and fortitude exceeding him farre, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Etymology of his name in Greeke, which signifyes Man-hood, Fortitude, and Valour.</p>
               <p>This happy King, and Monarch of that ample state, as he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned for his prouesse, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute authority, thereby gayned and purchased vpon that Realme; so was he most conspicuous in the eyes of men; for gouerning that kingdome with such equity, iustice, and religion; as though his life, otherwise, were full of many noble archieuments in warrs, yet his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4116:11"/>
wisdome and prudence, in gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being the essentiall part of his royall dignity, immortalized him more, then his martiall exploits, which for personall performance he recomme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to his Captaynes, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, and Generalls in the field, willing rather to put his victorious sword, into their hands; who knew how to brandish it abroad, then to bee wanting to his scepter at home, which none could wield or manadge like himself.</p>
               <p>But that which made him more happy then the rest, was the worthy Choyce he made of a deare Consort and indiuiduall companion, of either fortunes, such as that noble Princesse was, the Lady <hi>Gertrude</hi> daughter of the Duke of Carinthia, who being admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for her rare beauty, and Princely parentage, was yet more amiable to the world for her sage prudence and fayre demeanures, for which she was more esteemed: then for the Lyllyes and Roses of her Cheeks, and greater iustre of her family.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:4116:11"/>As wel appeared, as often as occasion serued, when her deare Lord, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to absent himself from his royall seate, &amp; she fayne to supply his roome, which she did full loath, and most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly, and yet so wisely that one could hardly tell, which most excelled, a princely Modesty, or Prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in her. So discreete and practicall she was in gouernement, as if made for Scepters, while she sate vpon the Throne; and yet so ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t againe of such matters, sitting in her Chamber with her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, while her Husband swayd the scepter in his person; as she seemed to know no more, then her needle, and how to sett forth her works in silkes, which she did most curiously indeede.</p>
               <p>In fine, they were both most happy, hee in her, and she in him, and it were hard to say, which the more, since the world afforded not a better pay—. Yea happy <hi>Hungary</hi> the while, where rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned such a Sunne and Moone by tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, in the Hemispheare of that flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing region. But yet more happy farr, and more illustrious they shine in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4116:12"/>
Ecclesiastical Hierarchy; for bringing forth into the world such a Starr, as <hi>S. Elizabeth</hi> was. Thus far hath shee been borrowing Light, &amp; lustre from them; but now like a Hesperus, shee begins to arise, and appeare her self in this fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament of ours, to glad both the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens &amp; earth with her presence, with such faire preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as these, making her royall entry into the world. And that with reason, since in triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phes, the wayes where Princes are to passe in their first entrances are strewen with flowers, &amp; adorned with tapestryes: &amp; what better flowers, can we strew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our <hi>S.</hi> then the vertues of her Stem, whence shee is deriued: what fayrer Tapestries then the noble portraits of her most renowned Pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, to precede, as it were, the procession of her life.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Gertrude</hi> Queene of Hungary, was found to be with child, you may imagine, what ioy and iubily there was; Who ioyes not, at the chaunting of the Cock, as being the signe, albeit remote, of the gladsome day at hand; but when as day begins to breake; and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:4116:12"/>
the Aurora appeares; Men do begin to open their eyes, to entertayne the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed starre of the day, &amp; by the <hi>Aurora,</hi> wil the wiser of them ghesse, at the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture day. The <hi>Aurora</hi> now was come, while <hi>Gertrude,</hi> in the howers of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, approached to her child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth. When <hi>Elinsor,</hi> a famous Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger of those dayes, deuoted to the princely Couple desirous eyther to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy his owne curiosity, or to comply with that of others; gazing on the starres, and obseruing their constel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, did calculate the Natiuity of the new borne childe. And found after he had turned ouer the whole Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merides; <q>that a Damsell was then to be borne, of that royall lynage, whose name should be <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> foretelling her good inclinations, vertues, and miracles, how shee was to be maried, and what the name of her Spouse should bee; that al should hold her, for the ioy and delight of the Church, and shee proue very singular in graces and spiritual endowments through the course of her whole life.</q>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:4116:13"/>
These were the sage, prognosticates of that Astrologer, by the helpe of his Art: If art may be sayd to go so farr as to deriue, vpon the operations of the mind; which I list not here to exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. It sufficeth his coniecture at least, was not amisse, and his creditt with men &amp; authority so great, as to breede an extraordinary expectation in them of some rare creature to be shorly bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and come into the world.</p>
               <p>And now behold the tyme was come, and <hi>Gertrude</hi> happily deliuered, of a daughter, and such a one, as bredd an vniuersall ioy in Court, and Citty, no place that was not filled with signes of triumph, especially at her entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce into the Church, by the lauer of Baptisme, when she put on, the ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>did robe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, washed with the blood of the immaculate Lamb whereof she was neuer dispoyled, to her dying day. A great confusion doubtlesse to vs Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, who not contented to breake our first faith, in stayning this robe, but after so many wholsome baths of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance returne to contaminate, the

same againe and againe, and I would to God, no more againe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> for soe now she is enrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the booke of life, to be cancelled neuer, as yet hanging on her Mothers breast; (for she committs not that treasure, to the trust of any) that she might truly bee a Mother wholely, and not to halues. <hi>Herman Lantgraue</hi> of Thuringia, hauing at that time like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a Sonne newly borne, called <hi>Lewes,</hi> and hearing of the vniuersall acclamation made, at the double Birth of this rare a Phoenix, partly through the good <hi>Omen,</hi> he conceiued thereof, and partly to match in soe royall a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; dispatches Embassadours, with good expedition to <hi>Andrew</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> to demaund <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> for Spouse for his said <hi>Lewes.</hi> Such it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes was the tenour of those dayes, and is yet in practize now and then, among greatest Princes, for reason of State, to vnite their kingdomes stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to each other, still leauing the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to their full choyce, when they come to the yeares of Election.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:4116:14"/>No maruell then, if <hi>Andrew,</hi> with his dearest <hi>Gertrude,</hi> after the matter had been throughly debated by his prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel, gaue so free &amp; easy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reto: for he sent away the Embassadors wel satisfyed with his royall promise.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Lantgraue,</hi> now at last, the Infants being growen to be three or foure yeares of age, desirous to haue such a iewel in his house, sent his Embassadors a new to fetch that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious treasure into his State, seeing no reason that since shee was to be inserted into the house of <hi>Thuringia,</hi> and was to flourish in that garden; but shee should take her greener sap from that soyle, and beginne so yong to frame herself, to the customes of that La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, hauing other reasons for the same besides: &amp; so likewise had <hi>Andrew</hi> &amp; <hi>Gertrude</hi> on their parts important mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, to hold her stil with them, &amp; not so soone to enrich <hi>Thuringia,</hi> with the impouerishing of <hi>Hungary,</hi> but least Nature, being but the one, might be thought to bee the whole impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, being prudent as they were, and not willing to take so weake an imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4116:14"/>
on themselues, they gaue order, for her sending to <hi>Thuringia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Queene, se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with her a rich furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for her Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, with a Cupbord of plate, of gold &amp; siluer, &amp; many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious iewels of inestimable valew, also diuers cabinets of pretti toyes to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne her infancy withall; and sundry cheynes bracelets, earings, carkanets, Chests of the finest lynne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, with other things besids wel befitting such a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse. The King for his part, sent his royall word, to allow her so much by the yeare, as should mainteyne her a conuenient Court, fit for such a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, vntil such tyme, as the Espousalls were solemnized, when, he would send her portion agreed vpon, at one entire payme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; and for the present sent her so attended, as became his Daughter.</p>
               <p>In this equipage, after a million of kisses of the Child, by the tender Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, at its departure from the Court of <hi>Hungary,</hi> went the Embassadors, of each part, with the treasure of heauen, very charily and tenderly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the same with easy iourneys, till they came to the Metropolis, where
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:4116:15"/>
the <hi>Lantgraue</hi> held his Court: Where being arriued (performing their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage to the Princely Father and the Dutchesse), they presented the Spouse to the yong Prince, who with a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious &amp; smiling countenance receiued her, to the great satisfaction and ioy of all. I will not stand here, to number the shewes &amp; triumphes made in that Citty, to welcome this great little Ghost, what fireworks were made, what triumphall Arks set vpp, in fine, what not, that might any wayes seeme to giue forth pomp &amp; magnifice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in a high measure. But that which passed all, was, the chearefulnes, read in the countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of al, but especially in the <hi>Lantgraue,</hi> &amp; his Dutchesse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, who as then presages in this happy arriual, an vnspeakable blessing to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, their family, &amp; whole estate.</p>
               <p>But ô disastre, after a three yeares space, the newes is brought to Court, how that faire <hi>Gertrude</hi> mirrour of Queenes, the goodly <hi>Cinthia</hi> of the <hi>Hungarian</hi> skyes in the plenitude and fullnes of her temporall feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,

               <p>HEre now imagin Death to haue been a sleepe, the while this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Queene <hi>Gertrude</hi> enioyed the Sunshine of her Life; and that he now began to awake and rouze himself to gather Roses, in their cheifest prime and fullest growth. Nor doth hee allwayes attend so long, but often

takes them in the bud: Howbeit this Rose was taken off by cruell Death, in her cheifest flourishing of all. God blesse the bud the while, the yssue of this Rose, that now begins to peere indeede in the garden of the world, &amp; giue forth shewes ere she be aware of her future sanctity. For loe by this tyme, knowing rather by instinct, and the vnction of the Holy Ghost<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then any reading, or help of any other exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Maister, besides her Paranimph, or Angel Guardian; of what importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was, the singular and special deuotion to the <hi>Saints</hi> of God, being of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per family, and dearest to him, &amp; such as continually assist in his presence, &amp; neuer take off their eyes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beholding him face to face: And knowing yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that howbeyt, they are euer prest &amp; ready to attend to their deuotes at al tymes, &amp; places, where &amp; whensoeuer with true Deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are called vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; Yet more particularly in places, where Temples, Chapells, Aultars, &amp; Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes are peculiarly dedicated to their honour, being properly the House of God, where he is pleased best to giue

audience, &amp; receiue the Memorials, suits, &amp; petitions of men. She therefore often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sortes thither, &amp; there, before euery Aultar would sometymes kneele, &amp; sometymes bow downe her body reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, in others presence doing what suited best with her dignity: but alone she would prostrate her self on the floore, &amp; steale some amourous kisses from the ground, &amp; most como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nly lift vp her hands to her breast; and likely alwayes, cast vp her eyes to heauen except sometymes when shee closed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to look into her self. O rare Bud of Sanctity and most angelical Infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, not more of <hi>Hungary</hi> or of <hi>Thuringia,</hi> then of Paradice it self!</p>
               <p>If in the Pallace shee had found the Chappel doores to be shut; shee would not wholy loose her labour, but reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently kneele at the threshold, and kisse them deuoutly; nor came shee euer without some suit or petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in her mouth, or in her hart at least. How many tymes, being in the heat of her sports, with the rest of her companions, and equalls in yeares, though in vertue and dignity, not like to her, shee would lay wagers, who in running should first arriue at the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:4116:17"/>
Chappell doore, to haue occasion the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby to make frequent Visitts of the venerable and most blessed <hi>Sacrament:</hi> Soe burning was the ardour of her Loue to her heauenly Spouse, whom she knew to sit within the Veyle or curtaine of those Species there. In the midst of her childish sports, she often tooke occasion to performe some act of humiliation or other; and that so pretily, as seemed not to be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striously donne but meerely vnawares, when as in truth, she would doe it of set purpose. Sometymes moreouer when she playd at cards with her Ladyes, and happily had won any money of them she distributed the same among her Mayds of the poorer sort, obliging them of duty, at least to say a <hi>Pater</hi> and <hi>Aue</hi> for her.</p>
               <p>She was now passing into the Ninth yeare of her age, when suddenly beyond all expectation, the <hi>Lantgraue,</hi> Father to her Spouse <hi>Lewes,</hi> departed this life, to the great astonishment &amp; dismay noe doubt of the whole state, finding it self soe vntymely depriued,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4116:17"/>
of its head, and the weight of so flourishing a Dukedome, as <hi>Thurin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> now like to presse, if not oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se the infant shoulders of the new Prince. But necessity hath no Law, and Death as lawlesse as necessity ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes but a sport of Chests, of the life of Man, and as soone giues a check to a King or Queene, as to a Pawne, and the State the while must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, to take their chaunce or fortune as it is; and make their best of their fickle and transitory game. by speedy substitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of some Protectour of that Gouernement and Prince, which heere wee intermedle not with, as hasting rather to the tender Princesse her self, the Argument in hand. Who, as the dawning of the Day hitherto, now begins to appeare more cleare, then euer in the Litle World or Hemisphea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of the Dutchy of <hi>Thuringia</hi> to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Day. For looke as her yeares en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, so the sparks of her childish and innocent deuotions, and vertues began more seriously to enkindle, and take fire in her hart, which the more intensly burned and flamed within her
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:4116:18"/>
as shee wisely went about to conceale them in her breast.</p>
               <p>One of the things, which Saints &amp; spiritual men do much recommend, is the frequent memory of God. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the worke in it self, most grateful and pleasing to him, it includes an act of Religion and of Prayer, fulfilling<note place="margin">Luc ca. 18. 1.</note> the same of our Sauiour. <hi>Wee must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes pray and neuer giue ouer;</hi> and also other acts besides, as Faith, Hope, and Charity, and the rest, and is most profitable for al, to keepe them from falling into Sinne or defects. <hi>So liue thou with men as if God had his Eyes stil cast vpon thee:</hi> Sayd <hi>Seneca</hi> the Heathen. This ground now of spiritual buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, wheresoeuer the Infant had it; shee infallibly layd; while shee tooke the resolution shee made, to haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes God before her eyes, euen in these tender yeares in al her actions whatsoeuer.</p>
               <p>Vpon which foundation shee built this Heroicall purpose, for his sake to abandon all the delights and pleasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of the world, al brauery in apparrel with their variety of fashions, in affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4116:18"/>
at least. And moreouer to leaue the pa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pering &amp; delicacyes of the flesh, yea more, al the vanityes of the world, not contented to refuse them only, but euen with a holy Tira<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that tyme forwards to trample the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder foote.</p>
               <p>And forasmuch as in her constant resolution, it was needful to begge di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine assista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, more then ordinary, shee tooke vp certaine deuotions, which shee likely omitted not vpon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; so as if she chaunced at any tyme to forget them by day, shee faithfully supplied the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the night: applying her self most deuoutly to the Mother of God, the inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable Virgin, to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to patronize &amp; seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d her pious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, &amp; to mediate her cause with her Sonne, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shee presumed could deny her nothing: then to her Angell Guardian, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shee coniured to looke vnto his charge, &amp; not to suffer her to breake her new made purposes. Shee eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> passed through the whole Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of Angels &amp; SS. of heauen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the highest Seraphin, to the Theefe on the crosse, to make intercession for her.</p>
               <p>But aboue al, shee addicted her self
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4116:19"/>
to the glorious Apostle and Euangelist <hi>S.

According it should seeme to the laudable practize now a dayes to make choyce of some singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Patron, to recurr to in all necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, and to serue with infatigable constancy to the end.

To which intent to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him the more; though she had already so especially and singularly chosen him before; she obteyned of God, in the comon suffrages or Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Saints, which according to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4116:19"/>

And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euer after fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that tyme forwards, she so highly reuerenced &amp; honoured this <hi>Saint</hi> &amp; <hi>Patron</hi> of hers, as shee ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily thought she was not to deny anie thing to any who begged or craued in his name.</p>
               <p>The Holy dayes she obserued most punctually and religiously indeed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her yeares &amp; capacity: Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she would lay aside some part of her dressings &amp; attires; esteeming on tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se dayes, quite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the vse of her Peeres, &amp; the practize of those tymes; the best decking &amp; ornament of all, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

reuerent in his presence, without the glittering of these pearles and pretious Stones, then to prancke her self with al those toyes, whereby the hart beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes ful of vanity and distraction; and therefore ordinarily shee left off her gloues, at least so long as the Seruice or Masse lasted, being desirous by degrees to breake her wil, though in smaller things, that shee might hereafter arise to more noble reflections, and gayne more noble conquests on her self. Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining, though the thing was but little in yt self, yet being donne in respect &amp; memory of the Passion, represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there in the dreadfull Mysterie of the present Sacrifice, it would doubtles be gratefull and acceptable to God.</p>
               <p>Many times shee would say to her Ladyes about her. Sisters, for the Loue of our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> let vs weare no gloues, nor put on any silk, gold, or Iewels to day, nor eate but of one dish only, or abstayne from such a dish, and forbeare at least to daunce this day, or to play at cards,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4116:20"/>
or the like. And with these begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, abstayning meerely for the Loue of God, by little and little shee gathered, and they by her example, the celestiall fruits of Vertue. When shee playd at any tyme and wonne, so as fortune seemed to smile vpon her; shee would say it was now tyme to giue ouer; because shee was flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with prosperity: reflecting the while, if men so reioyced with a little breath of prosperity or encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of so light a gayne, what would they do when occasion ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to breath vpon them, and they to obtayne the Margarits and Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of the ioyes of Heauen? In dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceing likewise which shee could not eschew to satisfy the Nobles, shee was content with one graue and solemne measure only, saying; it was sufficient with one stryene, to giue satisfaction to the world and to please the Louers thereof, and the rest shee would omit, and fairely interrupt for <hi>Christ's</hi> sake. And thus with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The fift, a hatred of her self for Christ, which she truly did, as shal appeare. The sixt, an abnegation of her self, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Loue. The seauenth, a daylie car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of the Crosse, or mortification of inordinat concupiscences.

               </p>
               <p>For loe, a faire occasion now begins to present it self to her, of arising vnto higher degrees of this exercise of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or Patience I may say. Since hauing such a Mother in law as <hi>Sophia,</hi> &amp; such a Sister as her daughter <hi>Agnes,</hi> by the death of her tender and deare father in law, now growne in great authority in Court, her Spouse as yet but yong. What can wee looke for, but stormes and tragedyes at their hands? <hi>Sophia</hi> indeed was a Woman, faire enough, and gracious to behold, but of a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and impetuous nature; and as she was her self, so bred she vp her child, as likly they are Birds of a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Mother though she were not yong, yet was not ancient, and if those yeares she had could haue borne her out, her mind would haue ranked her with the youthfullest of her Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes; &amp; what became not her self to do, she would be doing in others by setting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on, in fashions, attires, in dancing, gaming, and the like. She would be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:4116:22"/>
known to be <hi>Dutchesse</hi> of <hi>Thuringia,</hi> &amp; haue her dues in points of honour, punctually obserued; obsequiously at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended at Table, and abroad, by her Pages, and neuer without a Beuy of Courtly Ladyes about her. Her appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel not so rich as fashionable, relying more on the splendour of her iewells to make her appeare who she was, then the Gorgeousnes of attyres other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes: therein giuing scope to her Ladyes and Maids of honour, to vye with one an other, wherein taking a complacence, she seemed to exceede in them, so being guilty her self of their excesse. And yet whatsoeuer her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion was inwardly, she would hold stil a faire Decorum in her Chappel in the Pomp thereof; retayning stil a stately Maiesty in the exteriour cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyes; With this satisfying her self, that she complyed sufficiently with her obligations and her secular state, being the absolute Princesse and Dowager of that land.</p>
               <p>Her daughter <hi>Agnes</hi> seemed to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her hart, faire and bewtyful
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:4116:23"/>
indeed and as made for Courts; of a nature good enough and free of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position; and might no doubt haue beene more Religious and retyred, had the Mother with studious education trayned her in it, as she left her too much to her owne inclinations; a fault too frequent euery where, in the breeding vp of Damselles; though here no further hurt ensued, then certeine antipathyes in her, with our Princely <hi>Virgin,</hi> to exercise her vertues with. These two then, being equalls euery way in that Court for yeares and respects, by the ordinance of the Mother were suted both alike, adorned alike with glitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring coronets of gold and pretious ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels on their heads, with bracelets, eare-rings, and carkanets the same: in a word, exteriourly in the habit, no difference to be seene, saue only in the inward habit of the mind, in the sight of God, and Angels. For they going once into the Temple on a solemne festiual day, (as their custome was,) so crowned and richly attired, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:4116:23"/>
immediatly before <hi>Sophia</hi> the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Mother: <hi>Elizabeth</hi> presently at her entering into the church, layd off her Coronet of gold, nor would she put it on againe til the Sacrifice was ended; and al that tyme most humbly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutly demeaned her self, as she truly tooke it in the presence of her Sauiour, vntil at last she was admonished to go home.</p>
               <p>This fact of hers, now much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased <hi>Sophia,</hi> as an act at least of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion, or at the best vnaduisedly donne. Whereupon in tyme and place conuenient she tooke her aside, and peaceably and fairly demaunded of her, why she did so, saying. Daughter, what meant you the other day ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into the church to lay aside the Coronet you ware, was it a handsome sight trow you, in such a presence of the Estates, Counts, and Barons of our land to vndresse you in that manner in the view of al the people? To whom <hi>Elizabeth</hi> humbly made answeare. Madam, God forbid, I should be so irrreligious, if not impious, being such
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:4116:24"/>
a wretch as I am, to haue my head adorned with the splendour of a Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wne, and to appeare in so proud and haughty an equipage, euen in the tyme and place, where my <hi>Sauiours</hi> head is so cruelly tormented and crowned with thornes. At which words was <hi>Sophias</hi> mouth immediatly stopt, what with the goodly reason she saw she had to checke her so; but happily car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed it in mind, til an other tyme.</p>
               <p>By which appeared what impression, euen in her tender yeares, the Thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of her Sauiours crowne did make in her hart, deepely wounding her mayden breast, through meditation of his Passion represented in the Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the Masse. This compassion is an affect of the Soule which she had, wherwith shee ioyntly suffered with him, who suffered so, and transferred his dolours to her self; and to this end shee helped her self with these two things: first considering the quality of the person who endured: and second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the greeuousnes of the paynes endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: which shee did, pondering how
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:4116:24"/>
Christ our Lord suffered them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any succour of the Eternal <hi>Father,</hi> or his Disciples, considering also the delicacy of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plexion of his body; and how the interiour paynes of his soule were yet more greeuous then those of his sacred body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and these we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the thoughts that tooke vp her mind, during the Sacrifice of the Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se: while <hi>Sophia</hi> perhapps through dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayne was biting the lipp, and other Courteours whispering with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, as censuring hardly thereof, and murmuring against her.</p>
               <p>For that indeed, as Enuy is the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayd of vertue, and wayting at her heeles, with meagre lookes: So was the innocent and douelike demeanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of this <hi>Virgin,</hi> and her holy simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in contempt with the Courteours attending on her; who began with bitter words, and secret taunts, yea most iniurious and contumelious speaches now and then, and that to her face also, to play vpon her with cauills, nods, fond laughters, scoffs, and gibes, at her hyppocritical
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:4116:25"/>
sanctity, as they would terme it. And that the rather in beholding <hi>Sophia</hi> her self with her il trayned daughter, to concurr with them, and openly as it were, to applaud them for it, being so opposit as they were to her in their conditions. For <hi>Elizabeth</hi> being now in contempt with her self, esteemed the vanity of the world as filth and dung; togeather with these excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and preeminences of honour, and the pompes and gorgeousnes of attires: but they on the contrary, loued, reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; esteemed nothing lesse, then what <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did loue, reuerence, &amp; esteeme. She desired to please God only; but they, so they pleased the world, esteemed little to offend God. Thus the diuersity in their harts, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a great dissimilitude, &amp; Antipathy in their manners: so as hardly now, could they looke vpon her, with an equal eye, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly is wont in such occasions; laying open a large and spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious field to the <hi>Virgin</hi> to exercise al vertues in, &amp; no smal rock of scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to the other of their spiritual ruine;

               <head>HOW THE YOVNG PRINCE, <hi>Lewes</hi> declared his affiction to <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> not withstanding the malignity of her Aduersaryes. <hi>CHAP. IIII.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BY this tyme, <hi>Lewes</hi> the Prince like a rising sunne began to draw the eyes of al vpon him, euery one admiring some excellence or other in him, as each apprehended excellence to bee. Some would note his goodly personage, some obserue the whole sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry or due proportion of his body in the parts thereof; others his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion strong and robustious, his actiuity others, and dexterity in the manage of his horse. When hee was practising (though young) with the rest of his Nobles and pages of his Court, a man would haue thought him, as only made for martial exploits, and feats of Chiualry. But then in court to haue seen his faire behauiour,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4116:28"/>
his sweete disposition and affability to al, you would say that <hi>Mars</hi> had no part in him; but that hee had beene made for carpetts only, to comply with Ladyes; so ingenious and gratious he was in his discourse. But after that againe to haue seen him in the C appel, had been able to moue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion in the beholders, so deuout he would be at the solemne offices; so as then they would iudge him truly in his Element. And as hee was so pious and vertuous in himself, hee was highly beloued of al good and vertuous men, and a bridle to the vicious, to restrayne their exorbitances, through his rare exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of modesty, Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, Meeknes Courtesy, Sobriety; &amp; hence it was, he was so taken &amp; enamoured with his chast Spouse his inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</hi> Who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee noted to be so eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vertuous, as hee could not choose but effect &amp; highly regard her; though he were otherwise so te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perat &amp; discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te in his cariage towards her, as not a person in the world, nor yet the Spouse her self, could ghesse so much.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:4116:29"/>Which was the cause such diuers censures ran vpon the nullity of the Espousalls made betweene them in their Infancyes. For seeing such tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance in the youthful Prince, so actiue otherwise, and ful of life, they iudged he had no liking to her, and that therefore hee would sure refuse her, when he came to mature age. Especially since <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Espouse, was so aliened her self from that estate, as the company and society of men, seemed to be irkesome to her; much lesse that she would euer admit the maryed state; so as now in a manner she was held a Religious woman. And these discourses euery where, made the pious &amp; discret Prince, the sooner to declare and expresse himself to the vertuous <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as wel to giue satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the world in that point; and stopp the diuers rumours and iudgments of men, as to satify his owne affection towards her, and to be secured of hers to him, which could not be without some manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression; and which now at last he
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:4116:29"/>
did discreetly, chastly, opportunely to the great contentment and ful satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of each other.</p>
               <p>For lo this match of theirs, so made no doubt in heauen, receiued no lesse the fulnes of benediction from thence. So, as though she seemed otherwise in her life and example to haue beene vowed already to an other Spouse in heauen; yet was it so, as not in compati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with an earthly Spouse, whose wil some way or other, was knowne to her, to be, it should be so; and that he was content with conditions hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyly agreed betweene them, to haue a Riual for a tyme. How oft, alas, had the chast <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in the closet of her hart put forth that Theame to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted of, how oft had she concluded, now for the one side, and then agayne for the other; now it must be thus, now thus, now this, now that. Til at last knowing euidently as it were, the wil of God, which was the mayne ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of her assent to that estate; after she had resolued with her self, to harken to the Prince, she would
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:4116:30"/>
further satisfy her self with these morral reasons of inducements.</p>
               <p>First, that Mariage was honorable as auncient as the world itself, raigned in the Law of Nature, the written Law, and now a holie Sacrament in the Law of grace, and a great mysterie betweene <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Church.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that this Sacrament, is the roote of the faithful people, the Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery of Christianity, the soyle that brings forth Creatures, able to repayre the empty seate of the preuaricating Angels: The series of the lyuing stones wherewith <hi>the walls of Ierusalem are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> The very trunck whence yssued forth al the braunches, flowers, and fruits of the heauenly Paradice. The Spring whence al the brooks do flow, that water the Hierarchy of the Church. Then what an honour it was for Parents to bee cooperatours with God, in the most excellent work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manshipp of the world, and cheife Maister-peece of the Vniuerse; which is mans body, the perfect and best organized of al bodyes; whereinto
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4116:30"/>
being once formed, God infuseth the soule as a Margarit into the Mother pearle, which hee creates, and sends thereinto, a soule immortal, spiritual, and capable to know him, loue, and adore him. Then for the place of the Institution of Marriage, she found it to haue a singular prerogatiue, when she considered the same to haue beene established in the terrestrial Paradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, the most delicious place of the world, a place most happy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded with the most fauourable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of heauen, which, in the estate of Innocency was a happy and angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal state, if our first Parents had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly perseuered therein, and not lent their eares to the suggestions of Sathan. And though commonly it bee sayd, that <hi>Chastity</hi> replenisheth hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and <hi>Marriage</hi> the earth. Which she easily graunted, since she held for certaine that without a chast and pure soule none can see the face of God, yet she knew wel, euen in those tender yeares of hers, to distinguish rightly of the triple chastity: Virginal, Coniugal
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4116:31"/>
and vidual. She knew it to be most true, that chast continence reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth not the earth, but heauen; but yet withal considered, how the <hi>Coniugal,</hi> by the earth, replenisheth heauen; and with yts fruits, reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth and furnisheth both heauen and earth. For it furnisheth the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial <hi>Ierusalem</hi> with soldiours, and the celestial with most noble and victorious Triumphers.</p>
               <p>Now in regard these passages between the yong Prince and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as yet appeared not to the world by any outward signe, the Nobles and Courteours taking encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragment from the cariages and depor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tmens of <hi>Sophia</hi> and <hi>Agnes,</hi> who neuer left flerting and prouoking the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Damosel, with taunts and quips to her face, but especially with bitter nips behind her back among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, the matter grew now to be common in me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s mouths, that the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> should be sent into her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey againe &amp; the yong Prince was now to thinke of an other Spouse, more

It was a mirrour or glasse, garnished with stones of ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimable value as in a tablet, with two Christals opening of each side; One simple to looke into and behold one self in; and a Christ crucified most cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously &amp; artificiously wrought on the other.

as it passed betweene the Prince and him; and withall, presented her the foresaid Iewell; which shee tooke into her Virgin hands, as sent from heauen; not without a crimson blush; so to haue discouered her conceiued ioy in a matter of that nature; giuing the Noble man many thanks for his louing care of her honour, and his traueills taken on her behalf, prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting shee would remember him if shee were able, at least with her poore vnworthy prayers for him to her hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Spouse. <hi>Madam,</hi> sayd he, I take you at your last, &amp; so departed from her presence.

For which end, shee exercized her body with watchings, macerations, and fasts. For euen then she began, to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the softnes and deliciousnes of her downy bed, fearing least by pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering the flesh so much, shee might

And againe sometymes wel knowing the good disposition in the Prince, shee would plainely begg, and hee as freely permitt, shee might rise in the night, or early in the morning, to giue her

               <p>The Prince howsoeuer he approued these deuotions, yet affecting her so dearly as he did; could not choose but admonish her sometymes, to temper and moderate the excesse shee vsed, eyther in the tyme or intensnes of her prayer; discreetely aduising her to beware shee empayred not the health of that her weake &amp; feeble body.

shee gaue order to her Mayds to awake her, at a certaine tyme, when shee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to arise, Which to bee done more priuily; and that her watching and nightly rising might the better be kept from her Lord the Prince.

               <p>Which custome continually so preuailed vpon her, and her feruours therein now grew so great, as shee was not contented, that by stints and turnes to enioy these vicissitudes of rest, and rising in the night; but in the absence of the Prince shee was often found by her Mayds sleeping on a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet spread and exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded on the ground, when finding her self through a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>indly and louing liberty of theirs, to be handsomely checked and rebuked by them, as fearing least such manner of austerities might breede her harme and some great inconuenience to her.

But seeke a Reuerend, learned, and a pious Phisitian of our soule to deale with, when especially eternall happynes, or euerlasting misery de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends thereon. Not only to lay open the soares of our conscience to him,

in matter of sinnes, and temptations; but euen also of penances, mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, deuotions, &amp; in all other things wherein a man may easely digresse, &amp; step asi le from the right path, not only of sanctity and perfection, but euen of necessary saluation it self.

               <p>Such a Guide now had <hi>Elizabeth</hi> great neede of, to gouerne her amid such new deuotions and feruours, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day so taken vp by her, least that which was intended for her greater good and aduancement in spirit, for want of such a Guide or Directour, might redound to the greater dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, or at least degenerate in spiritual

gluttony. And this is that, which the Prince seemed to intimate to her, while he admonished her to moderate her feruours. When loe much about that tyme, came thither a Priest as dropt from heauen, called <hi>Conrad</hi> of <hi>Marpurge;</hi> a most worthy and famous personage, both in his exemplar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life, and eminent Learning; being sent by his <hi>Holynes</hi> at that tyme, to preach the word of God, throughout the Prouinces of <hi>Germany.</hi> Who preuayled so much through the singular gift hee had in preaching, and the Authority he purchased by it; that he no lesse repressed rebellious minds with a strickter hand held vpon them, a grauity of aspect, and powerful presence, then he attracted and comforted the obedient with his lenity and sweete proceedings with euery one. His life was fully answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the doctrine hee preached, and his works to the words he vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. His eloquence or grace in spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king was such, as was not easy to bee iudged which the greater: his learning

or feruour in the pulpit, which the more; or whether he were more happy in priuate discourses to winne &amp; allure the hard vnto him; or more successe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in preuayling with them, through force of the eminent tallents he had, especially in guiding and gouerning soules. Hee wholely contemned wealth and honours, riches, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnityes, and had an extraordinary zeale of christian Religion. Hee was besides a fatall Enemy and a mayne impugner of Heretiques; nor was he euer noted, ambitiously to seeke for Ecclesiasticall lyuings <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall goods of the Church for his owne vse, or vse of his Nephewes or Kindred, or so much as to accept of what was freely offered him in that or any of the like kind.

               <p>To this worthy man, and eminent Starre of the Church, the noble and vertuous <hi>Lewes,</hi> vpon knowledge of his so rare worths, being now grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne into some familiarity with him, and hee againe very grateful to both the yong Princes, and the whole Court of <hi>Thuringia,</hi> gaue leaue to bestow at his pleasure, and his owne discretion the whole gouernement and superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendency of all the Churches and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uowsons of Benefices, which in his State were remayning in his hands.

And shee of the other side, hauing thus made a surrender of herself, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and entirely vnto him, to be ruled and gouerned by him: disposed her
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:4116:42"/>
self to be most punctuall in obseruing his behests, and to regard him as an Angell sent from heauen, to guide her in the path way of perfection.</p>
               <p>How after many other practises of lesse moment vsed by the good Father, in dealing with this soule, wherein hee found her stil to come with great facility in the exercise of all ordinary vertues; he began to proceed more stricktly &amp; imperiously with her, to put her to the touch and triall of her true vertue and sanctity in deede. When behold a conuenient occasion thereof represented it self to him, and this it was.</p>
               <p>The good Father on a tyme was to preach (as he was ordinarily wont) of heauenly things, when especially hee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded this Seruant of Christ, not to fayle to be present thereat; &amp; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were that he knew before the necessary occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she had, to be absent or no, can no mantel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this only appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, that shee by accident fayling to be present at that tyme, through the vnexpected arriuall of her husbands Sister; in great displeasure, as it were

he sent her a sharpe rebuke, and as to one disobedient sent her word, he would neuer command her any thing more, who for so slight an occasion had broken her promise of obedience to him; and now shee might vse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>At which message, you may imagine how <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was stung to the quick, and grieued in her Soule, &amp; thereupon went immediately in all hast to her Maister, (for so shee vsed to cal him,) with her eyes cast downe to the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for shame, as not daring to looke him in the face, she humbly craued pardon of him; from whom when the angry Father, as in disdayne turned his face away; the humble creature not res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting her birth and dignity, fel downe at his feete, and would not rise till at last, through her humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shee obtayned; pardon acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging her errour therein, with all submissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but priuatly chid her mayds in a sweete complayning manner,

through whose occasion (as shee made it appeare vnto them,) shee had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the offence.</p>
               <p>It is the property of the tenderest consciences, especially in their first conuersions, to bee apt to scruples, which is a meere trick of the enemy of their good resolutions, to make them either wholy to break with them, or if they wil needs proceed therein, to take away the sweetnes they should otherwise find in the seruice of God, &amp; the way of perfection. This then was it, which troubled so our new Nouice, &amp; Disciple here in the schoole of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rad,</hi> who being warned by him, not to eate of meates purchased either by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or any kind of oppression; and sitting at table (contrary to the custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of such Royal personages) the very next to the Prince himself, through the extraordinary loue that was betweene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, shee incurred many greeuous scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, fearing to touch now this, now that kind of meate, where to abstayne from al, as shee was not bound, so in that same place shee could not do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:4116:43"/>Two of her Mayds were ioyned with her in this kind of abstinence, for whose quiet, besides her owne, shee fully prouided for, and therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured their dyet to bee prepared a part togeather with hers; &amp; to be allowed them out of her kitchin. Wherein shee had likewise good experience of the Princely disposition of her husband in such things, &amp; of his singular fauours towards her, in these and the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.

                  <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her self, shee would often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, in the Visitts of the Offices of the houshold, what prouisions were made of meate &amp; drinke; &amp; whether instly or vniustly they were purueyd or no; &amp; when shee was satisfyed, al was wel, with great ioy she certified &amp; secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her Mayds thereof, saying.

               <p>In the principal Feasts, indeed, shee was likely put to her shiftes, in the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of many of the States &amp; Peeres of the Realme, how to dissemble her abstinence, not only from meates for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but euen likewise from such as were lawful, and fit to be eaten, when they were either costly or deinty, or any wayes curious &amp; not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. For then, to dissemble her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence from al such dishes, according to her pious &amp; deuout resolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s made for the Loue of God; she would either discourse with the guesse, or els talke with the Prince at table, or bee car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the daintyest morsels to others, or drinke to friends, according to the manner of that countrey, or els send forth her Mayds vpon sleeueles errands

here and there, or change her trencher very often, and would vse a thousand other inuentions to deceiue her appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, &amp; the eyes of the Guesse &amp; weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, so ingenious is a mortified creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, disposed to deny, &amp; barre it self of al that is dainty or delicate: so as while others had been glutted with the choy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest meates, she very often would arise a hungry, &amp; go to her chamber, where she fed very sauourly on bread &amp; hony &amp; sometymes be contented with a bare crust, &amp; that very often of Rye bread, and a cup of the smalest wine. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer shee dined or supped by her self and not with the Prince her husband, shee would fare very coursely &amp; poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely, togeather with her said Mayds, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she had as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions of her disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, &amp; order of abstine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce so taken vp amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

to mend their commons, which they would neuer accept.

               <p>These meditations and internal colloquyes with the present Crucifix, were so vehement with her, that shee
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:4116:46"/>
was absorpt as it were, and without sense, when suddenly her strength fayling her, and her face now pale and wan, shee fel to the ground, as without life, whereat al the company of Lords and Ladyes about her being terribly affrighted and amazed, tooke her vp from the ground, and cast holy water on her: When their astonishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was passed ouer, shee returned to her self againe. And euer after, remayned with such a horrour and detestation against al vanity, that as if shee had been admonished by some diuine Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, shee abstayned from al sumptuous apparel, as much as her state and dignitie would permit, so as many tymes shee ware vnder her silks ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sharpe and cruel cilices.

               <p>Shee also, endeauoured both by
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:4116:47"/>
word and example, to draw some No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ladyes of the court, with whom shee was familiarly conuersant, from their excesses in rich apparel: telling them with effectual discourses, many excellent points and reasons against it; especially for Christians, professing to be the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of <hi>Christ;</hi> declaring how vnfitting it was, he being our head, &amp; crowned with thornes, that our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes should be so softly entreaded, acknowledging our selues to bee his members.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:4116:48"/>
of their virginal integrity.</p>
               <p>Shee remembred them withal, what <hi>S. Hierome</hi> said, as shee heard once in a Sermon which her Maister preached, discoursing of the penitent state and plight, wherein <hi>Magdelen</hi> was prostrate at the feete of <hi>Christ,</hi> washing them with her teares, and drying them againe with the hayre of her head. That she was so much the fayrer as lesse deckt. How <hi>Hester</hi> and <hi>Iudith,</hi> going to pray, cloathed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in sackcloth, and dolfully sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckled ashes on their heads, in witnes of the state of human condition, &amp; their owne dust and ashes. How <hi>Sainct Paul</hi> willeth women to performe at least<note place="margin">Tim. 2</note> their deuotions in the church, in attires that testify shamefastnes and modesty, not with frizled hayre, or with gold or pearles, or pretious garments. She added withal, how this gold, was to be left in the bowels of the earth, yts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place, and pearles in their shells, in the bottome of the seas: and how this sumptuous apparel belongs to Pagans &amp; Infidells, who make an Idol of their body, and dresse it vp to adore it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:4116:48"/>
because indeed they know not <hi>Christ,</hi> nor aspire to the seruice of the true God, who is to be honored with simplicity and integrity of the body &amp; mynd, &amp; not with plumes so borrowed of the birds of the ayre, drosse of the earth, or fishes of the Sea, concluding her speach at last with that terrible menace of the <hi>Prophet Esay</hi> against the<note place="margin">Isaye 3.</note> Daughters of <hi>Syon:</hi> which her Maister had often thundered in her eares.</p>
               <p>With these, and such like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the wife and discreet <hi>Dutchesse</hi> softned the harts of some of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, and made them to relent and remit somwhat of the excesse they vsed in braue attyres, now leauing off one thing, and then an other, that they might not sudenly seeme to make such a change al at once, and might the lesse be perceiued; so that ere long, an admirable change was made in that court, from gorgeous dressings, to a decenter manner of habit, partly through the example it self of their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and of the sainctly life shee led, and partly also for those reasons
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:4116:49"/>
alleadged by her, against such excesses, It cannot be told, what comfort the <hi>Princesse</hi> her self tooke at this holsome change which shee presently aduerted: and therefore taking more courage, to ascend to higher points of perfection with such as were capable thereof, shee tooke a faire occasion and opportunity with the yonger and tenderest of them, to fal in commendation of the Single life, but especially aduancing beyond measure, the Virginal state. To which purpose shee brake forth in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner. You may thinke <hi>maydens,</hi> 
                  <q>that what I shal say, perhapps, may not wel proceed from my mouth: who in fact haue em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced an other state, then what I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnto you. But this, <hi>good sisters,</hi> must I tel you, by the way, it is no precept at al<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but meerely a counsaile. And al are not worthy and capable thereof, then let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take the same, that can take it; among who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>good sisters,</hi> I haue allwayes reckoned my self the vnworthyest. And therefore, I would not haue you to wonder a whit, or hold my words in lesse regard, if I seeme to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend one

thing, and choose and embrace the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary my self. The thing then, I aduise you, is to a perpetual <hi>Virginity</hi> of mynd and body. For this is the noblest degree of al <hi>Chastity:</hi> consisting formally in a perpetual purpose, to abstayne from al carnal delectation, being a special ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and the principal point thereof; whereto is promised the fruite of a hundred fold, &amp; is reserued for such as keepe it entirely. It is the flowre of the Ecclesiastical Stemm, the Beauty and sple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dour of the spiritual grace, the most illustrious portion of the Redemption of <hi>IESVS.</hi> This <hi>Virginity,</hi> is most amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in it self: sweet as the sauour of the odoriferous Balme, wherewith as the bodyes embalmed, are preserued from the teint of any corruption, so by it, are no lesse preserued both the spirit and body, &amp; the vertues &amp; humane actions conserued, most pure in the sight of God, who restraynes &amp; contaynes the sences &amp; appetites, in a singular ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dour and beautyful lustre, representing the state of the immortal glory. <hi>Chastity,</hi> &amp; specially entire <hi>Virginity,</hi> is it, which
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:4116:50"/>
takes yts origen from the kingdomes of the heauens which makes you May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of earth, as wholy celestial &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical. For what is more beautyful, trow you, or more resplendant then <hi>Chastity</hi> and true <hi>Virginity,</hi> which trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes a Virgin, to an Angel. A chast Virgin indeed being a terrestrial An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, &amp; an Angel being none other then a celestial virgin, different truly one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other, but in happines and felicity only, in nature and not in vertue. For, if the <hi>Chastity</hi> of the Angel be more happy in it self, yet that of the <hi>Virgin</hi> in earth is confessed to be stronger, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bating continually against the intestine and forreine assaults of the flesh. And is so faire and goodly a vertue indeed, that as material whitnes or the colour of white in yt self, is the chiefe among al colours, and the very foundation of al the rest: So is <hi>Chastity,</hi> the spring and foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of al good works. And lastly <hi>Chastity,</hi> is a glorious vertue, the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of grace, the singular fruit of the Passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> of the nature of Angels, the sacred Sanctuary of the <hi>holy Trinity,</hi>

the Bed and Couch, of more then <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> strewed al with flowers. Loue then, <hi>ô Virgins,</hi> this so noble a vertue of <hi>Virginity,</hi> prise this pretious gemme and iewel of <hi>Chastity,</hi> cherish the same farre more then the apple of your eyes, yea more life yt self, the most inestimable of sublunary things.</q>

               <p>Thus spake the Princesse <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to the Mayds of honour about her, and they as seriously gaue attention to her. It can not be told, how their harts were now enflamed with the Loue of <hi>Chastity,</hi> &amp; perpetual <hi>Virginity;</hi> insomuch as diuers of them were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thereby, to embrace that counsaile, and through the helpe and assistance of their <hi>Lady</hi> were admitted into cloysters to become Religious. Which fauour and benefit next to God and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate <hi>Queene</hi> of <hi>Virgins,</hi> they ackno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wledged from her. Thus shee spent her tyme in Court, &amp; thus happily suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded her faire endeauours. With this ardent affect of <hi>Chastity,</hi> shee had the affect of fecundity also, and with the merit of a votiue and no vowed
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:4116:51"/>
                  <hi>Chastity,</hi> shee had the blessing of mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial fruictfulnes. There neuer was a creature caryed her self more euen betweene her heauenly and earthly Spouse then <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did, shee rendred so her debts, as shee defrauded neither, &amp; therefore was blessed from heauen, with three children by the Prince her husband <hi>Lewys,</hi> the <hi>Lantgraue</hi> of <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringia.</hi> First with a Sonne named <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> who succeeded his father in the Dukedome; and then two Daughters, one whereof was giuen in Mariage, to the Duke of <hi>Brabant</hi> then lyuing; &amp; the other admitted into a Monastery of Religious women, where in tyme shee was chosen to be the Lady Abbesse of the howse, and where shee gouerned the family most religiously, not vnlike to the <hi>Daughter</hi> of such a <hi>Mother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Her manner was, after shee was brought to bed, and delinered, and the rights of churching ended, to take her little Babe, and carry it in her armes &amp; going barefoote, &amp; clad with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble garment of home-made cloth, with a slender retinew about her, descend

               <p>NO doubt, but the good father <hi>Conrad,</hi> had giuen to the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> many singular documents of the theoricke of al vertues, and that by the vse of Prayer and meditation shee had got many rare principles of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatiue knowledge, of the diuine at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, and the infinite perfections of God, and many practical Rules besi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of true and solid vertues. Yet as reasons and considerations suffice not to take away feare which is natural to man, but it is needful also to apply some outward remedyes: as to bid
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:4116:52"/>
them to approach neerer to the thing they apprehend to be a Phantasme, and to touch it with the finger, to try and see by experience, that there is no cause of feare, and al to be nothing els but meerely imagination and their owne apprehensions. So likewise to loose the opinion and estimation we haue of the world and of al worldly honour and vaine pompe, and to make vs to set litle by them, neither reasons nor yet considerations suffice; but the acts of humility, which are the most principal &amp; efficacious meanes, we can vse of our part to obtayne the same; the thing which this good lady aymed at, in al the whole course of her life. For, as sciences and Arts are purchased with exercise, so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the morral vertues are not truly gayned, but by frequent external acts in the same vertues. As for one to be a good Musitian, good Artizan, or a good Rhetorician, or Philosopher, he had need to exercise himself wel to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne perfection therein.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> hauing in truth for

her principal scope to <hi>Loue God</hi> aboue al things, and the Neighbour as her self; conceiuing very wel how the same, consisted not so much in docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alone, or meere speculations, as in putting the same into outward practises, and to effect: and that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are not kindly indeed, but with habits; and habits not purchased (as I sayd) without frequent acts of the same vertues. Though her mind were wel inclined to pious works, and works of mercy to the poore, and such as were impotent and diseased any wayes, yet shee satisfied not her self with that pious effect only towards them, as thinking it not sufficient not to oppresse any, and to passe by, and say, God help you, to such as shee knew to be in any distresse, or which is more, not contented to perswade others, or to inuite them to be pittiful and helpful to the poore and necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, but releiued them her self with her owne hands: So as, that saying of <hi>Iob</hi> very aptly agreed<note place="margin">Iob 31<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

with her. <hi>From myne infancy, pitty and compassion hath been bred in mee: and from the womb of my Mother, it grew vp with mee.</hi> And to the end, this vertue of <hi>Compassion,</hi> might not be fruitles and barren in her, a singular Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was annexed to it, to which the Princes free disposition concurring, made her works to the Neighbour vrey admirable, as shal appeare in the ensuing narration throughout. Of which kind, for the present wee wil intimate two only examples of espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial regard.</p>
               <p>It chanced then, that this pittiful and merciful Woman, came to the knowledge of a poore and miserable wretch exceedingly affected with a certaine loathsome disease of lice in his head, which is called <hi>Phthiriasis,</hi> in such aboundance indeed, togeather with the head-ach, as it was no smal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and confusion to him, and with al the meanes he made, he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be rid of them. when lo, the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> desirous to dresse him her self, to cure the same, though
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:4116:53"/>
shee might haue commended the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to some other: yet by no meanes would shee giue consent, to haue any Riuall or companion with her in that act, being so faire an occasion offered, as shee thought to ouercome her self for the loue of <hi>IESVS.</hi> And therefore for the more priuacy thereof, and not to be depriued of so great a merit; vnknowne to any, so much as to her most intimate seruant <hi>Isentrude,</hi> shee found the way to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueigh the Wretch aside in al secrecy into her priuate Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, wherein many high trees were growing; for within doores it was not possible to be done without some notice taken: at least that shee might not be hindered in her pious endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour. Where notwithstanding the auersion and loathing, shee might easely haue had thereat; shee kembed his head, and cut his hayre, al clotted with filth, and till then vnkembed for many dayes, and killed the lice, and willed him confidently to lay it in her lap, which he did for a pretty space, til shee had wel scoured and washed the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:4116:54"/>
same. When her mayds, coming in by chance, and fynding their lady em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in so abiect a worke, and so vnseemely for her: admiring it, as not beleiuing at first it should be shee, roundly rebuked her for it, that shee being a lady of such degree and royal descent, would defile her fingars with so loathsome a disease, in pouling and washing the head of so miserable a creature; exaggerating withal the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that might bee, how il it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came her to do, it, which they for their parts would not do, for any thing in the world: Inferring besides, that doubtles her Lord, the <hi>Lantgraue</hi> would be much offended, if he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to come to the knowledge the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof.</p>
               <p>When behold, the good <hi>Lady</hi> somw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hat blanck thereat, to be taken so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly in the manner, beyond expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not so much for the shame shee had of the seruile work, as for that thé secrecy thereof was broken, which shee intended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and offered to the sight of God, and not to the eyes of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:4116:54"/>
or human censures; but smiling, shee handsomely seemed to put off the discourse to some other matter, vpon a good occasion offered: as not willing to iustify the same too much for feare of vaine glory, or to heare them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh so bitterly, against a thing which shee held as pious, at least not worthy of so bitter reprehensions, though otherwise glad and wel satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to haue done that and a great deale more, for whose sake shee did it: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king accompt, that what shee did, was meerely done for the loue of God, and not for human respects, and therefore shee ought not to regard it. And that to Loue God, it was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry further, to put away al respects of any creature soeuer, and to purge it from all terrene and carnal ends, and to loue and regard none, but God, who is highly indeede, and aboue al to be regarded: and if shee chanced to loue or esteeme ought els, it should bee for God; in somuch indeede as shee loued not God for her self, nor her self, for her self; nor her neighbour for
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:4116:55"/>
himself, but rather God for God, and her self for God, and her Neighbours for the same God; since the loue of God can not brooke the company of any other loue or respect, then of God. This surely, was a worthy example of perfect Charity to her Neighbour, being so meerely done for the diuine Loue.</p>
               <p>For shee wel considered with her self, what shee was of her self, in her first beginning. As for the Body. shee considered the same to be a vile and base thing, like other creatures: a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle blood; and a piece of flesh, skynned ouer with a parchment, as it were, somewhat finer then ordinary; yea lesse then it euen earth and clay. And for the Soule, how it was meerely as nothing: since God created it in her Mothers womb, of nothing. For the present, shee likewise considered how miserable shee was in the same body, how ful of defects, of miseryes, and infirmityes euery way: for the Soule, how poore shee was of vnderstanding and iudgment, how little shee knew,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:4116:55"/>
or could reach into, how ful of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and errours. But that, which touched her most was a true and liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consideration of what shee was like to come vnto, in respect of the Body. How shee was to be afflicted with some greeuous malady or other, that should vsher her to death, and death, deliuer her ouer to the tomb, where shee should make a feast or banquet for the wormes, and lasty be reduced into a litle earth, and brought into perpetual obliuion. And therefore, why should shee euer be proud a whit, or regard what her mayds sayd to her in that kind? For, thou <hi>earth &amp; ashes</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccl. 10. 9.</note> (would shee say vnto her self) <hi>what shouls'd thou bee proud of?</hi> 
                  <q>To day a woman, tomorrow perhaps, a lump of earth? And if I should value my self, (as they say) for my gentry, linage, and nobility, whence I descend, from royal and honorable Parents: Alas, how poore a thing it is; while truly it affords mee nothing nor putts any thing into mee, being only a meere estimation of men, and nothing in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:4116:56"/>
substance. Since, there is no differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce a whit, that I can find among vs al, eyther in the entry into the world, or the going forth, be wee rich or poore, noble or ignoble.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This iudgment now, and esteeme, which shee framed of her self, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her owne nature, and person, being more her owne and intrinsecal to her, then the goods of fortune, which but only accompanied her without, and attend more extrinsecal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on her; it cannot be imagined how great was the contempt shee had in her hart, against al these temporal ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which the world prize's and valu'es so much. From vhence procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the second example I promised aboue, which was this.</p>
               <p>On a certaine Festiual day, the yong <hi>Prince</hi> was disposed to inuite the Peeres and Nobles of his land, to a solemne dinner, which being now in order, and the Guesse come, and nothing wanting that could be desired in so honorable
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:4116:56"/>
an assembly, but the presence of the Princesse <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her self, who by chance was then missing, being al ready to sit downe at table, and shee not there, the louing Prince would not sit downe til shee came; and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore he sent the vsher in al hast for her, who went and met her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither, and told her, how the Prince her husband, and al the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers attended her coming, nor would sit downe til shee were present. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reupon shee hastned so much the more, and was now going vp the staires vnto the dyning roome, and as shee went, shee heard a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table voyce of a poore man, with great importunity begging an almes, shee being now on the midst of the stayres, and hee on the bottome thereof; being moued with the cryes he made, shee willed him to stay a while, and promised out of hand to send him something, since for the present shee had nothing about her. But this would by no meanes satisfy him, fearing be like, he might be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten:
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:4116:57"/>
and therefore cryed out more earnestly then before, saying: Good Madam may it please your Highnes, not to dismisse or dispatch me so. Your highnes was not wont to put off your clyents in this sort: and if your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence slight vs thus, who wil regard vs? Something I beseech your Highnes to bestow vpon mee, ere you passe any further and shut not vp the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells of mercy against so miserable a wretch, and this I begg for rhe Loue of <hi>IESVS</hi> whom you serue. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> hearing the sweete name of <hi>IESVS,</hi> in his mouth, made suddenly a stop: and pausing with her self a litle, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what shee should do. Money shee had none, and to dismisse any empty away, demaunding in the name of <hi>IESVS</hi> stood not with her gentle and amourous hart to the same <hi>IESVS</hi> her heauenly Spouse. The wretch was naked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and shee gorgiously and richly apparelled, as became her state and dignity, especially on a festiual day. Wherfore, shee tooke off her mantle, of exceeding great value,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:4116:57"/>
and without more adoe, let it fal from the stayre, cast into his armes; which he tooke and went his wayes out of the Castle most happy and glad of the charitable spoyle. And herewith, she went vpp to the dyning roome in al hast, fearing she had stayd too long; when the Vsher, who had beheld al, before she arriued into the Princes presence, had declared the whole passage already, to that honorable assembly, not without some shew of disgust and complaint for it. Which the Prince vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, smiled thereat; and she en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering in, he arose vp from his sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, to meete her as she came, saying most sweetely to her, according to his manner. Good <hi>Sister,</hi> why staid you so long; to whom she answered. Truly good <hi>Brother,</hi> I made what hast I could. The Prince sayd then: Where hast thou left thy mantle then? when she pointing with her fingar, replyed: Looke where yt hangs on the tacke there. And so it was, he looked and viewed it wel, examining
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:4116:58"/>
and turning it vp and downe, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it to be the very same. And was exceedingly astonished thereat, not knowing what to thinke of it: and al were put into a strange amazement; euery one iudging and coniecturing thereof, as they were affected, some one thing and some an other: only the Prince being priuy to the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and sanctity of his Spouse, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de the best construction of it, making very noble reflections thereon, not knowing whether to magnify more, either the operatiue faith or religious simplicity of his deare Consort, but so as he ascribed the honour of the whole matter vnto the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God, as a most vndoubted miracle.</p>

               <head>CERTAINE ADMIRABLE effects of <hi>Elizabeths</hi> affection to voluntary Ponerty: and the works she wrought in that kind. <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is incredible almost to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, what a holy celestial Loue, and pouerty of Spirit, this vertuous Lady had, to an entire renunciation of al wordly riches and pomps what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer: I cal it holy; because without earthly or terrene mixture; &amp; celestial, because it transported her heart disen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled from the goods of this life, to the fruition of the eternal infinite so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne, immoueable Goodnes, and therefore heauenly: I cal it pouerty of spirit, because she dispoyled her self of al things in affect at least; which notwithstanding I terme an, entire renunciation of al wordly riches, because whensoeuer her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:4116:59"/>
seemed to harken to any such thing, she interiourly renounced it by intense acts of the wil, disclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from it, being wholy enamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the cheife and only good. This loue of hers, to voluntary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, may wel be resembled to the Turky stone, being al azure and of a celestial coulour; or rather the stone called <hi>Lasial</hi> from whence the Painters (hauing beaten it into powder) do fetch the goodly blew or azure they vse, being a stone entermixed and diuersified sometymes with some little specks of gold, which glister within it: because indeed this Loue admits no terrestrial thing, but admirably adornes and beautifies the Soule, is alwayes mixed with specks of gold, to wit, of wisedome and diuine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations of the supreame goodnes and diuine prouidence, whereto she wholy remitted her self; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reon she only relyed, which made her so pretious in the eyes of God, as we may discouer in the whole nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. And this in her was a perfect
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:4116:59"/>
alienation and auersion of spirit from al these temporal goods, which God had put into her hands in that state and condition she was in, for the vse of her life, and to performe many acts of charity to the poore and necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. For God, would needs haue her hart, wholy free and acquit from al affects to terrene things; the better to giue vp her self afterwards entirely to him in ful possession, for the fuller accomplishment of the spiritual, euen in this life, and the greater encrease of her glory in the next.</p>
               <p>Hence it was that she gaue her self wholy to works of mercy and voluntary pouerty in al kinds. And first conceiuing Idlenes to be the Mother and nurse of al euils, and a marueylous hinderance to al Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian piety, whereto she wholy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to addict her self, for the loue of her heauenly Spouse, she had an especial care to bestow al the tyme she had spare from spiritual exercizes, and other necessary employments about her owne person; in workmanshipps
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:4116:60"/>
and labours of the hand or body. Nor yet did she as the Ladyes of her ranck are wont to do: who wil not set their fingers to any thing, coarser then the finest silkes: but delighted rather amongst her mayds to handle the coar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest wooles, somtymes in spinning, somtymes carding, somtymes in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the reele what others had spun, and then sending or carrynig her bottomes of yarne to be wouen and made into the coarser cloth, which ordinarily she distributed to the poore, and especially to the <hi>Fryars</hi> of <hi>Sainct Frauncis</hi> his Order, to whom she was much deuoted; amd in whom she no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a most strickt obseruance of the vow of Pouerty, whereto she was sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly enclined.</p>
               <p>Out of the great affection she had to this voluntary Pouerty, she would mend the habits of the poore with her owne hands, setting patch vpon patch, with a religious enuy or emulation that she might not weare such clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing her self. She trampled vnder foote, in the interiour of her hart, al
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:4116:60"/>
those worldly things, which Seculars esteeme so much; and whereof, these mad louers of the world make such accompt, there being nothing more idle, friuolous, and vayne. She would her self for the Loue of <hi>Christ</hi> experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce now and then the effects of Pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and for the commodityes which she was forced to take by reason of her state and condition, she vsed them as she vsed them not, to serue and Loue God the better, and with more freedome; and through excessiue Loue to fly into the armes of her cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifyed <hi>IESVS,</hi> her onely good, her ioy, her loue, her desire. And lastly her whole felicity was, to suffer incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dityes, not only thus voluntarily, as it were in iest, by framing of occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s for the purpose, but euen really: wishing indeed, to want the necessityes of a comon life, for the same Crucifyeds sake, who in the article of death, was by his enemyes denyed a drop of cold water to quench his thirst.</p>
               <p>She sought out Gentils, whereof there wanted not store, at that tyme
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:4116:61"/>
in those parts, who being already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced of their infidelity some one way &amp; some another, made suite to receiue our holy Faith. These, she instructed, as occasion serued, in the Christian Doctrine, &amp; while they remayned Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecumens, she releiued them with meate &amp; drinke, &amp; what other neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sityes they stood in neede of, vntil such tyme as they were baptized and many tymes be their Godmother her self at the font. She was not content to commaund such things to be done, which yet had beene a most pious worke, or to see it done, which had truly been more; but was no wayes satisfyed if she had not beene an Actor in the things themselues: so saithful a Steward she was, of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine dispensations in the seruice of <hi>Christ</hi> in his impotent members.</p>
               <p>It is a wonderful thing, with what courtesy and humility, she visited, comforted and releiued the poore sort of women with child, especially when she heard of their trauayle in child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, or that they were newly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered:
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:4116:61"/>
for then, she would come to them at al howers of the night or day, bringing such things along with her, as she thought most necessary for them; neyther yet could the length or tediousnes of the wayes, either craggy or durty, or of the weather, either rayne, wind, hayle, or snow, or the noysomnes or il sauours of such hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, so much as hinder her awhit, from going to them, to performe that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral worke of Mercy, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some labour of the body, she imagined to be of litle worth. And would rather want her owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modityes, yea misse euen things about her that seemed necessary, then the poore should want any thing which she could remedy. She was doubtles a rare patterne of <hi>Charity,</hi> the iewel of that age, a Margarite for purity and simplicity; a Ruby or Carbuncle for enflamed <hi>Charity</hi> to God and diuine Loue, and especially for her singular affect to Pouerty and the poore, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire right; and therefore when she left al besides, to put her in mynd of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:4116:62"/>
that vertue aboue the rest; she kept and ware that stone.</p>
               <p>The Saphyre is a stone of a pleasing colour to behold, and the soule of this Lady, was most pleasing to God, as wee may wel coniecture; how beyt with her self she were euer displeased. And for as much as, the Saphyre, is a solid stone, and not transparant, this soule being inuested with the loue of humility, was allwayes solidiy foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon her nothing, being one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that could not bee prolated or pierced by the light, or rayes of any vanity soeuer. The Saphire is vnapt for sculpture, they cannot engraue any thing vpon yt; and this soule so humble, could receiue no strange im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression contrary to that, which shee once considerately thought or resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vpon, or to that which shee saw and verily beleiued of her self: no opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or vaine estimation of her self, no vaunting word, or the like could be euer heard to come from her, though men and Angels had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured to perswade her to think wel
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:4116:62"/>
her self. That which makes the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire more pleasing is, certaine litle marks or sprinckles of gold here and there, wherewith it shines, and spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles as it were: so the shafts of loue &amp; wisedome, which this soule would dart and send forth to God; and her amiable humiliations, or modest and sweet fashions of fraternal charity wherewith shee conuersed with al, made her most gracious and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God and men. This iewel expells al venemous things, and mortifyes the Spider, as <hi>S. Bonauenture</hi> saith: So her humility easily expelled al sinnes, and especially vaine glory, whose works are as vnprofitable as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders web.</p>
               <p>So great and ardent a desire <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> had of this vertue of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and especially so enflamed an affect to pouerty; as al her pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctizes almost were nothing els but experiments and proofes of that vertue; so as laying aside her prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely robes, shee would make her mayds to dresse her vp, in a gowne of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:4116:63"/>
course cloth, and put on some playne kercheife or some such thing about her head, and being so apparelled skee would go soberly vp and downe in good earnest, with her eyes and countenance cast downe to the earth, and not disguizing her self out of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity in that manner, as some wil do, but truly and seriously indeed, as desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in her heart to continue so stil; Sayng to her Mayds I shal one day my self walke in that manner, in the streetes in good earnest; when I shal be found worthy to suffer iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes and reproaches for my Gods sake. Wherin, as it afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued shee shewed shee had the spirit of Prophecy, to foresee what should happen to her in tyme to come, which so fel out indeed. Good God, how gallant shee mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>OVR <hi>Sauiour Christ,</hi> as wee read in the Ghospel, one day found a great noyse and tumult in the Gallery of the Temple, by such as bartered therein, and bought and sold; and therefore being enflamed with the<note place="margin">Io. 2. 5.</note> zeale of Gods honour, with certaine cords and whipps which he tooke vp from the ground, as one in choller, draue them forth of the Temple: and as <hi>S.

               <p>But this lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> here of the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:4116:66"/>
contrary, was exceeding deuout, as wel at her entrance into the howse of God; as during the whole tyme shee was there present: Knowing wel, that one of the greatest deuotions a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian could vse, was to heare Masse euery day, or as often as he could. First, because the excellence and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity of the Masse is infinite, as being a Sacrifice wherein <hi>Christ</hi> is offered to God; who offered vp himself once on the Crosse, with all his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uells and merits; and is the most perfect act of Religion, wherein wee giue God the greatest honor wee can giue him: and secondly, is the most excellent act of prayer wee can possibly make. Wherfore from her infancy and tender age, til her dying day, shee was wont alwayes to be present at this venerable and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sacrifice; and very often was the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re her self before any other; when shee would keep her mind as free from distractions, as shee could; and if shee ware any ornament, which with conuenient decency might wel

bee spared, shee would either put it off quite, or handsomely conceale it, some way or other, vntil the Offices and Ceremonyes of so admirable a Sacrifice were ended. But especially, shee vsed a singuler reuerence, as wel while the Ghospel was reading, as the body of our <hi>Lord IESVS</hi> Christ was handling; applying no doubt her whole attention thereto, and preparing the mouth of her Soule for the worthy receiuing thereof.</p>
               <p>Her manner of hearing Masse was comonly in this sort. Most deuoutly on her knees, with great silence, and deepe and profound reuerence, and attention, without speaking with any or turning her head on the one side or other, but fixing her eyes on the Altar, and Preist (who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents Christ) &amp; obseruing the actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s he vsed: for al is a liuely representation of that, which the Redeemer of life, did, &amp; suffered in his most holy life &amp; pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. When the Preist at the beginning, said the <hi>General Confession;</hi> shee silently said it with the Minister also, being

contrite for her sinnes, and crauing pardon for the same. After which, shee attended to the wordes of the Priest, because they are sacred, it is fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> being ended, shee sayed inwardly in herself, making liuely acts of faith. <q>I confesse to thee Lord, al these verityes, &amp; whatsoeuer are contayned in the Creed, and the whole diuine Scripture. And through thy diuine fauour am ready to yeild my life for them. Do thou my God giue mee grace, that with my life, and holy works, I may confesse, teach, &amp; preach them to al, vnto thy glory.</q>
               </p>
               <p>At the <hi>Offertory,</hi> shee made an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blation of her self, and deuoutly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented her self and her occasions and affayres to God, that with the purest and most holy offering of his most blessed Sonne, they might fairely as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend into his diuine presence in an odour of sweetenes.</p>
               <p>At the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctus,</hi> she would conuert her self to the most holy <hi>Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:4116:67"/>
the <hi>Sonne,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> true God, in the company of al the Angells, and of al the Blessed Spirits, wishing that al creatures, and al men whosoeuer, would know, prayse, &amp; serue the same; and shee especially aboue the rest, might loue and honour it, with al her forces, and al the powers of her soule.</p>
               <p>While the Preist was reciting the <hi>Secrets,</hi> and <hi>Cannon</hi> of the <hi>Masse,</hi> she meditated vpon some point of the Passion of our Sauiour Christ, with an admirable feruour as her deuotion serued, and if not, shee recited some vocal prayers.</p>
               <p>At the <hi>Memento,</hi> shee would call her proper necessityes to mynd, and those of others, and propose them sweetly to her Lord with enflamed affects.</p>
               <p>At the <hi>Eleuation</hi> of the sacred <hi>Hoast,</hi> shee would most deuoutly and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently adore the most sacred body of our Lord <hi>IESVS Christ,</hi> which for her and al the world, was exalted and extended on the tree of the Crosse.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:4116:68"/>At the <hi>Eleuation</hi> of the <hi>Chalice,</hi> shee would likewise adore with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable inward affects and aspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the most precious Blood of her <hi>Redeemer,</hi> which was shed for her and all the world; beseeching her <hi>Sauiour</hi> through the same to make her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the fruits of the Tree of Life which hee was himself: And since he dyed for her sinnes; she might dye to them; and liue to him; and that her hart might bee the rock, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reon his Crosse might fix it self, and be the Vessel whereinto his most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious blood, might be receiued, a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor of infinite valew and price, and therewith bee washed and cleansed from al her sinneful spotts.</p>
               <p>At the <hi>Second Memento,</hi> she called to mynd very seriously the Soules of the faithful deceased, and prayed for those, whom shee thought best of, and were dearest to her, most hartily crauing, to make them pertakers of that dreadful <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and speedily to enter into the ioyes of Paradice, where they might liue, and raigne
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:4116:68"/>
with him for euer.</p>
               <p>At the <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> shee demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an ample pardon and remission of her sinnes, imploring his fauour and graces that shee might receiue him, if not sacramentally, at least spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, and that by meanes of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Sacrament, so receiued, shee might be vnited with his infinite goodnes.</p>
               <p>And thus shee vsed to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate at least spiritually euery day, which surely was a singular benefit for her spiritual profit, and which aduanced her to so eminent a degree of sanctity.</p>
               <p>She was wont to burne with a vehement affection to the blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, admiring much, how so admirable a Sacrament, should bee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded &amp; bestowed vpon mortal crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and deepely considering &amp; pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the omnipotence and infinite wisedome of God, in preparing such remedy against the rancour and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of sinne, and his infinite bounty in the free and liberal distribution
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:4116:69"/>
thereof. And when shee communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted sacramentally shee was often heard to break forth into these aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. <q>Burne then ô fire, and consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me whatsoeuer thou seest vnworthy in mee o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

O <hi>Bread</hi> of <hi>Angells,</hi> nourish my soule, and may it loose al tast of whatsoeuer is displeasing to thee Most sweete <hi>IESVS.</hi> O say that same to mee, which thou saidst to <hi>Zacheus</hi> hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to wit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     </hi> God of my hart, let mee bee wholy thine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and let none but thou, haue possession of my soule. After which, for a quarter of an hower shee seemed to enioy the presence of the Sacred <hi>Hoast</hi> within her; and then to breake forth againe into these acts of admiration. Who am I and who art thou my God, that I should be so visited by thee! O eternal God, what is man, whom so vnworthy thou settest thy hart vpon! Nay what is the Sonne of man, since thou lodgest
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:4116:69"/>
they flesh, thy blood, thy soule, thy Diuinity, within him, as in a most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious bower.</q> She further admired, how the Lord of Maiesty, and King of glory, not contenting himself, to become man, for the health and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of men, but that hee would needes abase and humble himself so low, as to remayne with vs, in this Sacrament, and to leaue vs on earth such a visible throne as it were of his mercy: more excellent without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, then the Arke of <hi>Alliance,</hi> to haue our recourse thereto, in all our necessityes.</p>
               <p>In these cogitations, the dignity of mans nature, especially of the soule, would glide into her mynd, for that God so created it meerely and wholy for himself. The heauens, he afforded to the Angels, the ayre to the birds, the Sea to the fishes, and the earth to plants; and Man to whom but to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self? Man therefore was created for God only: O then, may he be (shee would say) entirely possest by God alone. Shee would further imagine,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:4116:70"/>
how the Angels were of a nature more noble, and sublime then Man, yet God hath so much valued this his creature, as hee hath in a sort subiected these noble spirits to his seruice; according to the Prophett: <hi>Hee hath commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi>

Then shee would inwardly grieue at the ingratitude of men, for all these graces and fauours, so vainely bestowed on millions of them, most highly extolling the goodnes of <hi>God</hi> for all.</p>
               <p>Now this, so vehement feruour of hers being such, through these and a thousand such ardent meditations, pious exercises, and occupations of

When returning into her self againe, and casting the eyes of her body and soule vpon the Crucifix on the Altar hanging most piteously wounded on the Crosse, and all empurpled with his most sacred and precious blood, shee said vnto him by way of Apostrophe <q>Tell mee I prethee, how much is this blood

               <p>AS to arriue at the Port with a Galley, it is not enough to haue eyes to consider the card and compasse, and to gaze on the North Pole, to haue a Tongue, to discourse of the winds, a Sea Mapp, to contemplate the regions and degrees therein, if they haue not besides a paire of hands and armes to rowe with the oares. So to arriue at the hauen of Glory, it is not enough to speculate with the eyes of faith on the diuine mysteries, to reason and discourse well and suttly of them; nor to pray much, an argument of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:4116:72"/>
their hope, and confidence in God, vnited with a good faith in him, if they put not their hands besides to Workes, in testimony of this faith and hope. Belieue it, wings are not more necessary for a fowle to fly with, and to soare vp into the ayre, then good workes, especially Almes to the poore, are simply necessary to such as would attayne vnto heauen. Hence it was, that <hi>Elizabeth</hi> so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted her self to workes of piety, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, and all Christian exercises, as shee did. For shee alwayes, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Lent, obserued most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously the precepts of the holy Church, and Christian traditions, &amp; obseruances, by giuing her self not only to fasting and prayer, as wee said before, but euen also to shew much charity to her Neighbour, in assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting the distressed, and relieuing the poore with plentyfull almes, and in chastizing her weake body, with frequent Cilices, Disciplines, and watching. Shee obserued with great deuotion the Solemnityes of the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:4116:72"/>
                  <hi>Holy Weeke,</hi> wherein the mysteries of our Redemption are represented to vs: and celebrated the same with such feruour of mynd, as cleerely shewed her intense loue to her Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, who so highly praysed to the Pharisey, the good and pious works of his seruant <hi>Magdalen,</hi> as hee forgot not to recount the least of them, and recite them with all the speciall circumstances they had: shewing how gratefull and pleasing to him were all those litle offices of piety, which shee did about his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame loue towards him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For that kissing of his feete, that bathing with her teares, that warming them with her ardent sighs, those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyntings with pretious vnguents, yea the drying and wiping them with the tresses of her hayre, though so slender an office it was, yet of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular weight with the pious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate <hi>IESVS.</hi>

is solemnized, in remembrance of Christs last Supper, laying aside all costly apparrell, attired as one of the vulgar sort, shee was wont to walke the Stations in the afternoone, and to visit the Churches in that humble manner, so as one that knew her not wel, might haue easely mistaken her for one of the meaner sort; when sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for twelue of the Poore, shee disdayned not to kneele downe before them, and to wash, wipe, and kisse their feete, and finally to giue them twelue pence a peece in money toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:4116:73"/>
Patience, shee would giue them a liberall almes. The night before Good Friday, shee spent in prayer, and in deepe meditation of our <hi>Lords</hi> passion, and charged her Mayds in any case, to haue an especiall care, not to shew any reuerence to her on that day, but would needes goe the Stations bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foote. And at euery Sepulchre and Altar, lay downe a bundle of flax, and sett vp a burning taper, and put a quantity of Incense, or other such like perfumes into a Thurible; that the Churches might be full of odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous and fragrant sauours where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer shee came; and so taking the smallest moneys shee could get toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and passing in company with the meanest sort, shee went vp and downe the streetes barefoote, dealing them very bounty fully to al the poore.</p>
               <p>Some there were, who esteemed this manner of distribution of small moneys, to be nothing sutable to her state and calling, and to proceede of Coueteousnes, and of not of Princely and heroicall disposition, saying, that

shee being a Kings daughter, should vse the bounty and liberallity of a Princesse; and for her to abase her self so, as one of the multitude and vulgar sort was most vnworthy, and no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument at all, of her sanctity or deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but rather of a base and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate mynd. But the glorious Princesse, made litle accompt of all those whispe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and regarded not what the maleuolous sayed, and thought it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to relieue many, with many litles, then to giue much to a few. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ceased not, to perseuer dayly in that which shee had so seriously deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to do, assuredly presuming that God who is aboue, and sees all things, knew her hart, to be as farre from any couetous humour, in so doing, as tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se rash and sharp censurers, were alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate from truth and equity.</p>
               <p>On the dayes of publique Litanyes in the streetes, the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> cloathed her self in course cloth, and so went along in Processions, &amp; to heare the Sermons in the Church, would thrust her self among the meaner sort,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:4116:74"/>
and take vp her place amidst them, as holding the Seed of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the most part, to spring and grow vp more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and aboundantly, in the soyle of an humble hart.</p>
               <p>It happened now, in the yeare of our Lord 1225. the Prince taking his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney vnto <hi>Apulia,</hi> to waite on the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, that through all the Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Germany,</hi> was a generall fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and many perished for want of foode. Wherevpon <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> taking occasion by the Princes absence to exercize the works of piety, with more liberty then euer, began with a bountyfull hand to distribute to the poore, the corne which had byn gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and stored vp in al her Dominions, allowing to a great number of them a daylie portion of corne, for their maintenance, according to the age and condition they were of, and the extreame necessity they were in. Nor did any of them want (through the especiall grace and prouidence of God) though happily they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued lesse then a measure conuenient
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:4116:75"/>
to susteyne them with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And forasmuch as shee vnderstood there were many sick and infirme persons, who by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their maladies or other impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, were not able to ascend vnto the Castle and Pallace which was si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated on the top of a steepy hill; shee caused presently an Hospitall of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding beauty and capacity to bee erected in the bottome of the said Hill, vnder the castle, and therein placed especially such of the poore, as were most maymed in their lymmes, &amp; the weakest and feeblest of them, whom shee in person her self once a day, and somtimes more, would goe to visit, though hindred not a litle by the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult descent of that craggy mountai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne: and then shee would demaund of each one, how they did, and what they ayled most, or what kind of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te liked them best, which when shee vnderstood, shee gaue to euery one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly of the prouision shee had brought along with her for that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, with so much loue and tendernes towards them as you would rather

               <p>Among which, so dispicable creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, shee principally applyed her self, to poore Orphans and little Children left destitute &amp; voyd of freind, whom with a motherly care, shee would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

them with her holy hands as occasion serued, and euen to dandle them in her lapp, whom her Mayds for hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour onely, could not patiently abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de to looke on; such was her Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and fortitude of mynd, as with the one, shee would attempt any thing, and goe through stitch with the other, in whatsoeuer shee once tooke in hand.</p>
               <p>She made choyce of certaine of the poore from the rest of the multitude, that resorted to her, whom shee espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially commanded, at a tyme appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to attend at the Castle Gate, to whom with her owne hands shee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed the scrapps and fragments which were left at her table, vsing now &amp; then some prety slights to spare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not only from her owne trencher, but euen likewise, when handsomely shee could, from those of others, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shee knew wel could help the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, to the end the poore who wayted vpon her, might not depart empty away, but find sufficient refection, whensoeuer they came: and this (as I
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:4116:76"/>
sayd) shee distributed with her owne hands. Which though to some might seeme vndecent and extrauagant, that so great a personnage should descend so low, saying the office might better haue beene recommended to others: yet I presume if they consider the Gifts of the holy Ghost, &amp; the fire of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that burned within her, they would leaue to wonder or spare to censure her; but rather reuerence and admire her for it, and finally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to imitate her rare example.</p>
               <p>This her singular Charity by some outward signes of Gods especiall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours towards her, seemed to be not a litle approued by him, which how litle soeuer they appeared to be, yet proceeding from him, are not to be accompted litle.</p>
               <p>Vpon a tyme, <hi>Elizabeth</hi> bringing downe from the Castle certaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents of toyes made of earth and glasse, for the vse of Children, and being set on horsbacke, with her lapfull of such things, to deale amongst the litle Innocents as occasion serued; her
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:4116:77"/>
apron by chance being loosse, althose litle toyes fell to ground, which neuer left tumbling downe, til they came to the bottome on a rocky, and stony way, which being taken vpp and brought to her, were found to bee as whole and entire as euer.</p>
               <p>Shee tooke great pleasure som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes, to haue the poore fed within the Gates of her Pallace, and which is more, somwhat neere to her owne table, to whom now and then, shee reached meate with her owne hands, of the dishes which shee her self was serued with, and manie tymes caused them to be left alone by themselues, that they might eate, drinke, and chat togeather the more freely, as wishing them, together with the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiety of the belly, to haue some good relaxation of the mynd, that so God might be honoured either wayes. Whereby it happened once, that they hauing drunke a good quantity of drinke amongst them, the Vessell was yet found to remayne litle lesse repleate then at first, in testimony
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:4116:77"/>
no doubt, how gratefull this kind of Hospitallity was to the diuine Maiesty.</p>
               <p>Shee tooke order in the Hospitall, for 28. poore people, to be careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prouided of all things necessary, and that when any of them dyed, an other should be put into the place. Such as daylie in her sight receiued almes otherwise, according to the quality or necessity of each one, were nine hundred persons at least. And for the rest, whom shee other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise liberally susteyned by the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Wherein shee wasted, spent, and consumed the reuenues of a most opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Signory, and oftentymes sold the clothes and ornaments from her back, and her iewells, and the hangings and furniture of her howse; that the members of Christ might not perish for hunger. In which holy exercise shee serued God with so good a will, as that a certaine sick body, one day begging a litle

               <p>This vnion and Concord in this state, the happy couple of Princes kept inuiolable betweene them, and this was that, which the Enemy of all peace enuyed in them, and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what possibly he could, by his Ministers and malignant persons, to enfringe through malicious suggestio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s framed against the innocent Spouse, traducing her vnto her husband at his returne from <hi>Apulia,</hi> as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dig all in his absence; and a most immeasurable waster of his estate, so much exaggerating the Complaint against her, as they blushed not to auerr, shee had left them nothing

Whereat the Prince was abashed, and pausing with himself, shaped him so wise and discreete an answere, as hee let him see the folly of his desire in his owne respect; in seeking to purchase him an heyre in that sort, and for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self discouered in his countenance a high disdayne and deepe indignation against him for making the motion; and framing so fowle a suggestion against the honour of both their Bedds, and cheifely in contempt of a principal commandment of God, and so, an open practize of Rebellion against his diuine Maiesty.

Hee gaue audience and executed Iustice himself, with such equallity, patience, and longanimity, as hee not only by his example led the way to other Princes, but seemed to bee a lampe before them.

deplorable state with vnspeakeable teares, deepe groanes, incredible sighs perpetual prayers and oraisons, beseeching him, through his diuine goodnes and clemency, to haue pitty on his afflicted people; and pardoning their offences, to turne away the rod of his indignations and displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure against them. Til at last being now falne into the depth of al mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes, inuoking te Abisse of mercy, they were heard by him who is the God of al consolation The forme or model whereof, or rather the first occasion taken of their redemption, I wil here declare in breife.</p>
                  <p>The holy Citty of God <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> sometimes most deare vnto him: being thus in a miserable bondage, subiect to infinite oppression vnder the tyranny of the Infidels and Saracyns, among those who of deuotion went thither to visit the venerable places of our Redemption, being led with the same feruour; came likewise a very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table man of the Church, called <hi>Peter</hi> the <hi>Hermit</hi> by name, borne in the

                  </p>
                  <p>He was a person but litle of sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and for the exteriour, carying no great part with him? but of a great viuacity of spirit, and fit for high at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheiuements, being interiourly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished otherwise with singular vertue and prudence, as one that could wel explicate and deliuer himself and his affayres. This Pilgrime entring into the Citty with the rest, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the wretched &amp; calamiteous state of the faithful people liuing therein, &amp; thither repayring for deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sake, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting the matter and taking it vnto the hart, found the meanes to acquaint himself with <hi>Symeon</hi> the Bishop the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof, a very good man, of a tender conscience, and fearing God, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with him thereof, and to consult vpon some remedy. When <hi>Peter</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing from him the lamentable sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te of that City, groaning vnder the intollerable burden of the <hi>Saracyns</hi> and Enemyes of the Faith; was so moued thereat, that he could not refrayne from teares, but demanded

what helpe there was for so great mischeefs and euils: the good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour replyed. The sinnes of the people are cause of al. But if the Christians were so zealous of the honour of God, as they bee, some helpe might yet be found, but there is none wil take our cause in hand.

                  <p>This free promise of his, seemed to come from heauen, and pleased the

In the meane while, the poore man finding his shoulders too feeble for a busynes of that importance, began to faynt, but yet his great Charity put him on mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re hotly vpon it. And the rather ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing receiued a Reuelation from God in his sleepe, to encourage him to it, which signifyed thus much.

For the tyme shal come, that the holy places shalbee purged and cleansed from al pollution, and my seruants succoured. Whereupon <hi>Peter</hi> awaking, leapt vp, wholy comforted with the vision, being encouraged thereby to prosecute the busynes; and so taking his leaue of the Patriarch, with good diligence

arriued at <hi>Rome,</hi> where finding Pope <hi>Vrban,</hi> he presented him the letters, and faithfully made him a perfect rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the state of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and did it so efficaciously, as moued him not a litle to apply what remedy he could. And therefore immediately, being the yeare of the Incarnation of our Lord. 1085. Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> called a <hi>Councell</hi> at <hi>Cleremont,</hi> wherein he assembled al the Prouinces beyond the Alpes. So as on the Moneth of Nouember following, was gathered togeather in the Name of our Lord <hi>IESVS Christ,</hi> a holy assembly of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops, and other Prelates of the Church, accompanied with a good number of Princes of the Kingdome of <hi>Fraunce.</hi> And <hi>Vrban</hi> remembring his promise to <hi>Peter</hi> the <hi>Hermit,</hi> in a most eloquent and prolix Oration, recommended to the <hi>Councel</hi> the important buisynes of <hi>Hierusalem:</hi> and hauing liuely set downe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable state of those countryes, hee graunted that famous Indulgence of the <hi>Croysado,</hi> in these words.</p>

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:4116:103"/>
most tyrannically and iniuriously dealt with.</p>
                  <p>But then, what did <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the while, the noble Imitatresse of the Apostles, deseruing well the purple of Martyrs? She bare her self with an incredible and most prodigious patience, farre transcending the power of nature, wholy heauenly and aboue all nature. For in her hart was no reuenge soe much as imagined, much lesse intended or harboured; in her mouth noe word of impatience, or any interiection that might any wayes seeme to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the same; for how could it bee, where there was noe spleene? And for her outward gestures they were all soe composed, as she had beene in the greatest tranquility that might bee.</p>
                  <p>She murmured not, she com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playned not, for being soe iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously put forth of her chamber, and Royall bed, to seeke her lodging on bare boards against all reason and iustice. But rather inwardly reioyced
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:4116:104"/>
to see her self, soe ill entreated and soe litle respected, for that in truth her whole hart and confidence was placed in God, and soe went she away, saying with <hi>Bias</hi> the heathen Philosopher: Lo, I carry what soeuer I haue along with mee. She carryed indeed noe transitory things of this world about her, but others much better, and not on her back, but all in her mind, which could not bee vsurped or taken from her.</p>
                  <p>Being thus driuen out of her owne howse, she went to the towne in the botome of the Castle hill, where she entred in with her Mayds that were with her into a common Inne; some say into the cottage of a poore wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, where she remayned til mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, when the <hi>Fryars</hi> of <hi>S.

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:4116:104"/>
for her, in token how ioyous and ful of consolation she was in her self for this first encounter of fortune Comforting her self with that of the Apostle writing to the <hi>Romans,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re hee sayd. <hi>Hee comforted himselfe and gloryed in his tribulations, and gaue infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite thanks to God for them.</hi> From that tyme forward she edeauoured by al meanes possible to procure her self a roome or lodging of her owne, where she might freely liue by her self, and not depend of others. But those of the towne for feare of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and his Complices, durst not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford her any, so much as the meanest Houel, and therefore she was fayne for want of a hole to put her head in, to remayne in the Church of the fore said Monastery al that day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing vnto the Euening; which being come, her greife, and affliction was augmented the more, for that <hi>Henry</hi> her Brother in Law, to bee more free in the gouernement of the State, cast forth of the Castle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the Infant <hi>Herman,</hi> Heyre appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:4116:105"/>
with his two little Sisters, whom now she beholds to descend downe the hil, to come to their Mother, in the Monastery where she was, for as yet she had no other dwelling, but the Church porch, whom notwithstanding she recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with a magnanimous &amp; vndau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted courage, though otherwise she could not choose but tenderly weepe to see those Innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts so insensible of their estate, as to smile vpon her, amidst their greatest disasters, reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing no doubt to haue so recouered their Mother, whose litle absence the while, had beene a bitter pil vnto them. Ah litle Babes (she sayed) lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle do you know the wretched state you are in, and where to lodge you (alas) this night, I know not; poore harts where are your delicate and soft Couches, where are now your attendants. Nay where is any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te to put into your mouths? The Foxes haue holes to harbour in, the Birds haue plumage of their owne to keepe them warme, and when

their yong lye gaping in their nests for foode, their damme is at hand to afford it them, your only little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants more vnhappy in this, then Birds and Beasts, haue not a morsel to put into your mouths, and yet you smile vpon mee, and soone I feare wil cry as fast, when I haue it not to giue you.</p>
                  <p>Wherevpon to lodge and repose her Children, she repayred to the howse of a certaine Clerke, who poorely entertayned her in a roome, without hangings, money, or fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, or any thing to eate. Where she remayned for certaine dayes most incommodiously, and in great misery; partly through the straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the place, for her whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and partly also through the great penury of al things there, for the susteynance of man. After that she remoued her self into greater and more ample roomes, to bee able to accommodate her children and family the better. But there she remayned not long, but soone
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:4116:106"/>
she found out that one commodity of a larger roome, did bring a thousand discommodityes with it: for the Owner of the howse and the inhabitants there, were so cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se and peeuish to her, as she could find no rest amongst them but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite vexations of euery side. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore hauing no other helps in that place, but what the bare walles we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re able to afford her, departing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and bidding them farewel, which had somewhat defended her and hers from the asperityes of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for it was at that tyme, vsing these speaches to the bare walles. I thanke you Walles most hartily, for the harbour you haue giuen mee this while, and would haue binne glad to haue yeilded as much to the Inhabitants, had they been as ciuil; And so not able to find any other lodging in the whole Towne; she betooke her self to her former cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage or litle ease.</p>
                  <p>Thus this great Lady and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in a moment as it
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:4116:106"/>
were, cast downe from the throne of eminent dignity into the Abysse of temporal miseries, and she, who the other day harboured thousands of poore, now poore her self, could find no entertaynement or harbour any where: She that cherished In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants and Orphans, was glad her self to begge for hers, and to craue an Almes from doore to doore, and seeke to her Enemyes themselues. Oh instability of human things! and which is yet more admirable, who could discerne in al this while any least signe of pusillanimity in her, any least wonder, or murmure against God or his holie Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to proceede, but rather perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual blessings and benedictions to flow from her; saying euer. <hi>Blessed bee the Name of God;</hi> and with holie <hi>Iob: Our Lord hath giuen, and our Lord hath taken away:</hi> and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand other iaculatoryes besides, which she how rely sent vp to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
                  <p>While <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was yet in this
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:4116:107"/>
distresse, there happened a thing to her which I may not let passe. She going one day alone by her self vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some occasion or other, and being by the way to crosse ouer a certaine durty or myery Lane, where was no passage, but vpon stumps and stones, placed for steps here and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re for the purpose, and the good Lady, standing with her self in a study how she should do to passe ouer, hauing no staffe to sustaine her self withal, in case her hart should fayle in the way, nor practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in this kind, hauing euer beene caryed til then, in coaches and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Behould who should she see on the other side, but a certaine old woman whom she knew very wel, being one, whom shee had in her better fortunes exceedingly fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with many extraordinary bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits: this woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> likewise, as she ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, stood stil on the other side, as pausing with her self what to do. Wherefore they both stood awhile immoueable as pinching courtesie
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:4116:107"/>
who should first passe ouer. The Lady thought for respect sake she had forborne, or through gratitude for former courtesies; but she like a Monster in nature, purposed a worse matter. For the Lady not to stand ouer long vpon such ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes aduenturing first, being now in the midst of the steps trembling as she went for feare of falling, the other more practized in such wayes, susteyning her self with a staf in her hand, met her in the midst, and thrust her downe into the dirt, and hauing so donne, went her wayes, ieering and laughing at her. Ah monstrous impiety to deale so with an innocent Lady, in the extremity of her miseryes! The holy <hi>Elizabeth</hi> came forth of the dirt in so fowle a plight as you may ghesse: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing wiped her self as wel as she might, went on her wayes, and tooke the iniury so patiently, as she returned not the least word of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content thereat, but inwardly smiled with the excessiue ioy she
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:4116:108"/>
felt, to see her self soe basely affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without cause, which she offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp in vnion with al the indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes her Sauiour suffred at the hands of the <hi>Romans</hi> &amp; <hi>Iewes</hi> in the howse of <hi>Annas, Cayphas, Pilat,</hi> and <hi>Herod;</hi> and for this act, she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of her Spouse incredible fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, as shal immediatly appeare.</p>

                  <p>Hauing sayed all this within her self, because she was in the open Church, mouing but her lipps only,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:4116:110"/>
as <hi>Anna</hi> did when she begged <hi>Samuel</hi> at the hands of God, which proued a Prophet, &amp; consequently Seeing God, as all Prophets are said to doe; she obteyned very speciall graces, and the vision of strang and mysterious things. For lo, she was suddainely rapt into an extasy, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uating and raysing her soule and vnderstanding soe vp to heauen, as she seemed to be kneeling, fixed in the place, without iudgment, or operation of the senses, with eyes notwithstanding as glued to the Aultar. Till at last returning to her self againe; <hi>Isentrude</hi> her dearest and most faythfull seruant, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of her loue and respect towards her; presumed soe farre as to presse her much, after many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusalls, to declare vnto her, what she had seene, while she was soe rapt, and alienated in her senses, with her eyes fastened on the Aultar. To whom at last she ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weared, and said. O daughter, I may not make any mortall wight
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:4116:110"/>
priuy to those heauenly secrets which I saw. But this I tel thee, since thou vrgest mee, and coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest mee of al loues; that I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished with wonderful and vns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peakeable ioy, beholding with the eyes of my mind such heauenly my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries: and this is al good <hi>Isentrude,</hi> I can say vnto thee in this matter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Isentrude</hi> was forced to rest satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with this answeare, though her much curiosity, could hardly brooke the denial, so curious are mortals of immortal secrets: But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued if euer the like happened agayne, she would be so refused no more. From thence then they returned to their poore and most pityful lodging againe. Where the holy and blessed <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> was fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to restore nature, with such poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re pitance as she had, after soe stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge an extasy and alienation of mind. Which though it wrought on the soule, yet was it doubtles laborious and toyle some to the body, to bee so long suspended from the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:4116:111"/>
and operations of the powers thereof, they being so deare and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuidual companions during life. But being of a weake constitution, a litle sufficed her; then after refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, she desired to be priuate, as willing to rest and repose her self in her Chamber with <hi>Isentrude</hi> alone. And being as I said extreame weary with the former excesses of the mynd, she layd downe her head on <hi>Isentrudes</hi> lapp: and soe began to fall asleep, and soone after to weepe as she slept, and then againe to smile of a suddaine, shewing a chearefull and serene countenance withal, as she had receiued extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary contentment at somewhat or other. Anone she would weepe againe, and then smile, welnigh as soone: and those alterations and strange viciscitudes of diuers and opposit feelings, went and came all that day vntill the euening, yet seemed she oftner to smile then weepe, and then at last she vttered these words. <hi>Yea truely my Lord soe</hi>

                     <hi>it please thee, to remaine with mee, I will neuer depart from thee, but still perseuere to abide with thee for euer.</hi> When she had once expressed these words, which <hi>Isentrude</hi> directly heard and punctually obserued; she awaked, nor can it be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned how great was the desire which <hi>Isentrude</hi> had to heare the mysterie, and therefore laid soe strange a battery of importunityes against her Ladyes humble resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as she was forced to yeild to her, and to reueale the whole passage as it was, saying in this manner.

                  <p>Saue only an Aunt she had, being Sister to her Mother, and Lady Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>besse of a famous Monastery in tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se parts, who hearing of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage vsages and proceedings with her Neece, framing a farr higher conceipt of her deserts, then the ordinary sort could diue into: Partly moued with the respect of blood, partly out of charity, and partly also for the rumour of her sanctity, which amidd all her aduersityes and contradictions more and more dilated it self, in the opinion of the best iudgments, and all such indeed as were not caryed away with ignorance or sinister passions. This Aunt of hers, tooke such order, what

with her louing inuitements, and what with the meanes she contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to bring her to her, which wanted no difficultyes, by reason of her great necessityes, that she and all her Mayds, hauing taken in the meane tyme the best order for the children that might bee; were brought to the Grate of the Monastery, humbly attending the good pleasure of her Aunt there ready to expect her: Where who could expresse the tendernes that passed betweene them.

                  <p>When hauing mutually saluted each other as became then, and falne vpon many vertuous, spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, and diuine discourses, they gaue no place to murmures or

And hauing now at last wel vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood her cause, she knew the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter how to apply comforts in the rest of her discourse with her, which she did most aptly indeed: in humouring the affect of voluntary Pouerty in her, yet tempering the same with the wil to recouer her right againe, to bee able to make a larger and freer donation of what she had to the benefit of the poore, rather then by such a general renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, mixt with a kind of violent compassion to suffer her meanes so silently to remayne in the hands of iniurious Extortioners, greatly to the detriment of the poore, whom she desired to releiue so much; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring

And soe taking their leaues of either part with such assistance as the Lady Abbesse could giue her, and very efficacious letters to the said <hi>Bishop,</hi> she went to <hi>Bamberg.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where being come, the Bishop was aduertized thereof, who could hardly beleiue the same, til he saw
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:4116:115"/>
and read the letters from his Sister her Aunt, which she sent him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she came into his presenee. The Bishop, good man, could by no meanes hold from weeping, at the sight and reading of them, much lesse when they met, which moued the harts of al the Clergy about him, considering the strangnes and rarenes of the accidents of this poore Lady. When appointing a Lodging neere his pallace, for her and hers, they had good commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to meete often, and to conferr of matters concerning her weale, and recouery of her dowry; and if it we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re possible, which hee proiected, and she maynely resisted, to restore her againe to her estate as amply as euer. Which designe of his by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees tooke so great impression in him, as hee not onely apprehended it possible to take effect, but as it happens in such cases, held it in a manner as done already. So as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Neece to bee young and beautyfull, he began to plot with
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:4116:115"/>
himself, how to marry her honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, a second tyme, and to match her in some potent family to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then her cause, the more easily to purchase her right. And therevpon till he were better, and more fully resolued thereof, what Prince she might be espoused vnto, and how to deale in the matter, he sent her, with her humble trayne to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Castle of his, to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated with all things fit for her Calling; at least what was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for her in that estate, till she might bee better prouided, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion serued.</p>
                  <p>The innocent Lady her self was nothing aware of al these plots and workings in her Vncles head, as being a matter she least dreamed of, so farr she was from fauouring yt in the least, or giuing any way thereunto. Howbeit her Mayds some way or other, (who knowes) had got some knowledge of the Bishops intent. And being priuy to their Ladyes most chast purpose,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:4116:116"/>
and little lesse then a setled Vow, and partly iealous of their owne, least their Ladyes resolutions once being violated, theirs might suffer wrack, and they likwise be draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne some way or other to embrace the coniugal state, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their Vowes of <hi>Chastity;</hi> beca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me very sad and anxious, discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing thereof now and then sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tously among themselues, what were best for them to do to preuent the same, and whether it were not fit to proue their Ladyes constancy or no, for their better satisfaction, and to giue her notice of the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger she stood in; which happily she aduerted not, a thing so farre per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her innocent apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sion.</p>
                  <p>While they were in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation with themselues. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> comes in, suspecting nothing lesse then that their whole discourse was touching her: but yet could easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue her Maids were greiued and perplexed at some what; for
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:4116:116"/>
they al stood looking on each other, as if they had something to say to her, but were not wel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined who should beginne. Wherefore, to breake their sile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, she thus beginnes her self. Mayd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, what is the matter with you, you are so troubled in your mynds? for I discerne some sudden change amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g you. Are wee not welcome heere and fairly entreated in our Vncles howse? Tel mee, I say, are you not wel vsed, hath any discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesy beene done you since your co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming hither, or tel mee what is the matter with you? When lo, they all stand looking on <hi>Isentrude,</hi> thereby insinuating as much, as she should speake &amp; expresse their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> greife &amp; lay open to her their feares &amp; iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies. Which she did, presuming of the liberty &amp; freedome she had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten giuen her to be a faithful Admo nitresse to her.</p>
                  <p>The truth is Madam (sayd she) my Sisters are al in a great perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xity about your Ladyship, least
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:4116:117"/>
your Vncles royal entertaynement here might haue some sinister end, so farr they are, from what your Ladyship misgaue, of their al vsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, as that from the contrary they gather a worse conclusion. Madam in a word they feare least your Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle intends to assault your noble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions of vidual chastity, and goe about to plot and contriue how to violate the same by a tender of some honourable match to your Lady ship, which in reason he may thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke you cannot refuse, your stare and condition being such, for your present temporalities as they are. This <hi>Madam</hi> was the argument of their discourse, and these their fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, grounded on the tendernes they haue of the honour of your Ladyship, and somewhat to of their own imbecilities who rest so much on the rock of your constancy Which causelesse iealousies, as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, I haue been labouring to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant and roote out of their harts. But one word <hi>Madam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>To which <hi>Elizabeth</hi> with a chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reful and serene countenance, smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, sayd. <q>Take you no care my daughters: nor trouble your selues any more about this matter. I trust in the diuine protection for my part, that looke what I promised in the life of my honoured Lord, I shal performe and accomplish pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after his death, likewise to the end of my life. And though it should fal out, that I were prest by any authority or commaund whatsoeuer, or otherwise were menaced by power, or were allured with al the flatteryes of freind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship whatsoeuer; I shal neuer suffer my self to be drawne from that man, whom not for man I took but for the holy Sacrament of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony. Nor do I feare a whit, what force can do against mee, since let them vse what violence they can, yet still I shal reteyne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire

the liberty of my free will,</q> and shall shew my self to bee such a Mistresse of my self, as I shall neuer yeild consent thereto, but sooner disfigure my selfe for a last refuge.</p>
                  <p>With these her resolute, and heroicall words, her Mayds were well satisfied, and comforted. And the Venerable <hi>Bishop</hi> who as yet had done nothing in the matter, but only reuolued the thing in mynd, hauing religiously commended the affayre to God, being moued and touched by the diuine spirit, let fall his designes, and desisted of himselfe from the enterprise, without hauing euer made the least intimation thereof to any. Giuing order, that <hi>Elizabeth</hi> might stay there where she was, as long as she would, and be left free to dispose of her self, or goe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer she pleased.</p>

                  <p>The body then being taken out of the tomb? wherein it lay; and the flesh consumed by such artificious meanes as they vsed, by the diligence, of the most expert therein, they tooke the bones and enclosed them charily, in a certaine Chest, or pretious Casket, and being attended for a good space by a world of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Dukes, and Marquesses, and of Counts, Barons, and Knights without number, in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal order, they went with Ensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnes folded vp together with a doleful and dismal sound of drumms, al clothed in black, and other warlike instruments in like sort. Thus went they on in goodly order to a certayne place appointed, where they were solemnely met with, by other Princes and Gentlemen of the Countryes they passed thorough, where the Marshal troups too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke their leaues in warlike, wise

                  <p>Thus euery day they carryed the body, going in manner of Procession, deposing it in some Church at night, or els in a Monas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, causing Masses, Dirges, and other suffrages to be saied for his soule, offering vp many Gifts and donaryes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to euery Church, where the Offices and Rites were performed, as Tapers, Herse-cloths, and Blacks.

Tel mee I pray by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal God who sees and beholds al things: what could a silly Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ful of peace and piety offend you, that so against al iustice and right of Nature, without any
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:4116:126"/>
cause at al, you should thrust her out of al her Goods, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented therewith, deale so inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely with those Princely In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents, as to engage them also, so yong, and tender, in the like calamityes with her. Whereas if had you no bowels of Mercy, towards your own blood, yet might you at least haue had some compassion on the tendernes of their yeares, vnmeete as yet to suffer such iniuryes.</p>
                  <p>But yet (<hi>Sir</hi>) thus much I must confesse, I vnderstand that you your self are not altogether in the fault, whom wee know to haue beene bred and endued with a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and more generous dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, but rather the lewd, and vngodly Councel about you, who hauing impiously abandoned al piety and goodnes, haue labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to entangle you likewise in their wickednes, and seeking to make you degenerate from your owne blood, haue first endeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:4116:126"/>
to dispoyle you of al feeling of common sense. Pardon mee I pray, most noble Prince, if I speake with more vehemency, and boldnes then becomes mee: for I cannot flatter nor sooth vp Princes in their humours, but must sweetly put them in mynd of their dutyes when they seeme to swarue; and tax and vprayd the vices which I note in others. You haue beene hitherto abused with the venemous perswations of the maleuolous: Now follow my councel then, and correspond with the Votes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of al these Gentlemen here, who wish the increase of your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and reputation. Put <hi>Elizabeth</hi> entirely into her state, and dignity againe, and I wil vndertake she shal be reconciled vnto you, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the auncient freindship agayne with you, as no such thing had euer beene, and such capitulations, and conditions shal bee had betweene you, as greatly shal redound to your
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:4116:127"/>
honour, and the greater profit and aduancement of all yours.</p>
                  <p>Thus spake the stout and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous Champion of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as ready to enter into the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall lists in her behalf, as to pleade soe like an Aduocate her cause, in whom was no lesse fortitude and magnanimity to goe through an enterprise, then sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity and discretion to contriue the same. His valour and heare of courage, made him not precipitous a whit to attempt any thing vnaduisedly, but gaue him force and vigour to atchieue what soeuer he had sagely premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated before. He was no lesse rich and potent, then stoute and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: all which soe concurring in one man, gaue a powerfull and efficacious energy to his speach. Wherefore the Prince, besides the pregnant and conuincing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons he gaue, being moued not a litle with the authority of the man; relented somewhat, and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:4116:127"/>
anone surrendred the Citadell of his hart, wholely into the power and disposition of the Baron: the rest of the Lords reioycing the while, to behold soe great a change and alteration in him. For his eyes now standing all in teares, his lipps being full of lenitiues and sugred words, he now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired nothing more then to haue his hands appeate as effectuall in works. And therefore immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely offered to <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> not only her proper demeanes of Dowry and other Viduall rights belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to her, but euen likewise the gouernement of the state as she had before.</p>
                  <p>These newes were almost as soone brought to the eares of the vertuous <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as vttered from the mouth of the Prince, so ioyfull they were all, to heare them soe ingenuously to proceede from soe franck and liberall a hart. Only <hi>Elizabeth</hi> when she heard the same, most candidly answered, she would
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:4116:128"/>
by no meanes yeild her assent to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke the gouernement of <hi>Thuringia</hi> vpon her, or to charge her weake shoulders with so insupportable a burden; and that if it pleased the Prince to restore her dowry againe and other rights belonging to it, it was al she desired, that she might vse them for her owne saluation, and the behoofe and benefit of her hushands soule: and as for the gouernement she regarded it not, but left it wholely to their dispose.</p>
                  <p>Herevpon they carryed her with a great trayne into her auncient Castle againe, where she liued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and whence she had beene iniuriously expelled. And <hi>Henry</hi> thenceforth regarded her as a great Lady and Princesse, desiring obsequiously as it were in al things to accomplish what she required; she no sooner intimated her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in any thing, but hee was ready to see it executed to the ful, and especialy he besought her at
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:4116:128"/>
least, to vse the marks, and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in vse with Princesses like her self. Who would haue thought now but this <hi>Lady</hi> would haue taken some complacence at this happy returne into her owne agay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and howbeyt to be eased of the burden of the gouernement she might refuse indeede the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge; yet for the rest which she wel, and lawfully might enioy without dommage, and preiudice of her religious purposes, to lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue so meerly for the loue of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty was an act indeed of heroical fortitude.</p>
                  <p>For lo the Serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thus for some dayes in her said Pallace, re-installed and re-invested againe in al that belonged thereto, fearing least perhaps through aboundance of al daynties, delicious fare, pomp, attendancyes, and worldly glory, wherewith she was now entreated, she might come to loose in a moment the diuine grace, wherewith
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:4116:129"/>
she had hitherto beene copiously endued, she refused wholy those speciall cherishments they gaue her, and freely and voluntarily left that delicious and dayntie life, and immediately betooke her self, to an humble Cottage the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby, with intention to liue and perseuere in that manner of lyfe now of her owne election, which of force heretofore she was fayne to lead: and this for the loue of her <hi>Sauiour IESVS CHRIST</hi> her heauenly Spouse.</p>

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:4116:130"/>
not only condemned by her aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ill Willers, for superstitious, hippocriticall, and a meere dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler; but euen her best freinds, and such as hitherto had stood most for her, began to dis-esteeme her by litle and litle, till she lost them quite, holding it a madnes in her, soe in the flower of her youth, now they had procured her to be restored to her former di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity and estate, to disclayme from it of her owne accord, and soe much to neglect her self, and contemne the world as she did by that act of renunciation which she made, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when they saw her to respect Pouerty soe much, as to preferre it farre before all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, riches, and delights of the world, and to prise Deuotion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Court, and the delights thereof: soe as they now could hardly looke on her with an equall eye. But the Seruant of Christ, vpon the warrant &amp; testimony of a good conscience, knowing she did it for
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:4116:130"/>
the loue of her deare <hi>Sauiour,</hi> set light by all, and endured all their affronts, scornes, and reproaches, with such patience and constancy, as she reioyced not a litle to be able to suffer any thing for the loue of him, Who had vouchsafed her the fauour to suffer: Who as she was now growne a wondering stock to the world, and by the foolish followers thereof, adiudged &amp; held as a meere distracted Woman, for those her extrauagancyes, (as they tooke them) to fly industriously, what they al ambitiously sought for and soe eagrely aymed at; as honour pleasure, preferment, and the like; vtterly refusing the Regency of those estates, with the liberty, delights, and pompes of the Court, abandoning all in pursuit of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, soe greatly in contempt with them. Soe was she, in another sense as much admired and beloued of the pious, iust, and all good people, for a mirrour and pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of all vertues. Soe as
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:4116:131"/>
now, the Pope at that tyme being <hi>Gregory,</hi> hauing heard the fame of her excellent vertues, tooke espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall notice of her, and for her better encouragement therein, admitted her as his Daughter into the protection of the Sea Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, and vnderstanding how that famous <hi>Conrad</hi> the venerable Preist, had some practise and dealing with her heretofore in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall matters, he recommended her more ouer particularly by letters vnto him, to haue more speciall care then ordinary of her, in guiding her in the way of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: pursuing the pious and religious inclination he found in her to the vtmost scope and extent she was capable of; sending her withall in the said Letters, Which purposely hee was to shew vnto her, most graue and holy admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions and words of exceeding comfort, instructing her by the example of the blessed Saincts, to the practize of Patience, Chastity,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:4116:131"/>
and perseuerance in all vertues, giuing her to Vnderstand, there was noe other way to Heauen, but that which <hi>Christ,</hi> with all his Saints had trod before her, and as it were euen leuelled for her, with continual paynes, inuincible la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and infatigable trauaills: assuring her moreouer, he would not forsake her, but euer esteeme her as his deare Child and louing Daughter, if she went forward and proceeded with constancy in the course soe happily begun.</p>
                  <p>These letters, you may imagine were accordingly shewed by <hi>Conrad,</hi> to the vertuous <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and gaue her incredible content, to vnderstand, his <hi>Holynes,</hi> the Vicar of <hi>Christ,</hi> should take soe especial a note and regard of her, and therefore now more then euer, determined to aduance her self what possibly she might, in the way of perfection: beseeching <hi>Conrad,</hi> according to the Popes instruction, to take a more special
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:4116:132"/>
account of her, then hitherto he had done, giuing him from then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceforth absolute power of her. Which accordingly he accepted, and she thereupon made a surrender of her self into his hands, to be wholy guided by him, submitting her self to a punctuall obedience to him in all things, for her greater merit.</p>
                  <p>The Father then with a graue and venerable aspect, made a large discourse vnto her; vnfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding many Texts of scripture, and alleadging for her comfort, many testimonyes and examples of Saints in approbation of the act she had done, in making a voluntary Oblation of her self, into his hands, by soe free a Donation and entire surrender of her self; and encouraged her also, to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world, chastizement of the flesh, and to an vtter diuorce and full renunciation of all transitory things, in affect at least, though not in effect
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:4116:132"/>
for speciall ends.</p>
                  <p>This Seruant of God was soe enflamed with these sweete spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of her Master, as she was now more set on fire then euer, soe as she would needes arriue at once to the vtmost perfection of Pouerty and humility: and for this end entreated her Master, she might bee suffered to begg her lyuing from doore to doore; but the holy man by noe meanes would condiscend thereto, saying. It was not conuenient that a Princesse of that blood, and soe tender and delicate of Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion, should goe vp and downe the streetes a begging. And for that she persisted still in her suite with many teares, hee chid her for it, saying: where was her Obedience now, had she soe soone forgot her holy purpose? that Obedience was a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and litle lesse then a kind of Martirdome; and that if aymed
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:4116:133"/>
at perfection, there was noe other way, more secure, more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious, and sublime then to yeild vp her self, in a whole and entire holocaust, by a perfect ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negation of her Will in all things, through a voluntary obedience, and a most exact accomplishment of her Vow. Whereupon she passed noe further with her hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sute.</p>
                  <p>But yet was not a little troubled that she might not be suffered to renounce and abandon all at once protesting priuately to her Mayds in familiar discourse with them, that she accompted the World as meere dung, and had neuer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore affected wealth or worldly riches half soe much, as now she had a loathing, not only of the property and dominion ouer them, but euen the vse and handling of them, euen for the vse of others, if she might haue her will; but my Master (she would say) will haue it otherwise, and soe will I to,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:4116:133"/>
since hee will haue it soe. And for her Children, she professed more then once, that she loued them with the same affection she loued others, since she had now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended them to God, and left them to his heauenly protection. And finally for the pure loue of God, that she willingly endured all the slaunders and contumelyes of the enuious, and the reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mocks and scoffs, abstracting from their sinnes who soe freely and prodigally brake them on her, she both desired them, &amp; delighted and gloried in them, as the Apostle in his infirmityes.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore seeing her former designe tooke noe better effect; she soe submitted her will to the necessity of obedience, in that point of not begging from doore to doore, as she thought her self as yet left free in the other; to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyle her self at least of all domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or power in what she had assigned for her dowry, and other
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:4116:134"/>
Viduall rights allotted by the Prince in the agreement made betweene them, thinking it enough to content her self, with the vse only of what should be necessary for her, from the said rents. And therefore she watched but occasion to abandon such property and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion in them, to follow as she desired euangelicall Pouerty, and the example of her deare <hi>Sauiour,</hi> the neerest she could possibly. When presently this occasion was offered.</p>
                  <p>It was then the holy Weeke, when vpon <hi>Good Friday</hi> she went with her Maister, together with her Mayds to the Monastery of <hi>Saint Frauncis,</hi> to bee present at the Ceremonyes, and to heare the Sermon of the Passion on that day. After which, the solemnityes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they retired themselues, to a certaine Chappell of the said Monastery, for their particular deuotions, where fynding the Aultar dispoyled likewise of all
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:4116:134"/>
the ornaments, as in all other places vses to bee on the same day: Vpon the sodaine in a feruour, she went to the said Aultar, and laying her hand thereon, with a solemne Vow made her self formally a <hi>Nunne</hi> of the <hi>Third Order</hi> of <hi>Saint Frauncis</hi> of the <hi>Penitents,</hi> wherein she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced her Parents, her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and al her freinds with the pomps and Vanityes of the world; and finally her proper Will, and was euen about (and certainely had effected it) to haue renounced the property and dominion also of all her terrene possessions; If the Reuerend Father <hi>Conrad</hi> at hand, with his sage wisedome, and sweete and apt words, had not hindred, and suddainely interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her speech, commaunding her to stay there, and to passe noe further in her Vow; saying, she had promised enough, that first it were fit to put in practise what she had already taken in hand, ere she rashly aduentured on the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:4116:135"/>
rest, without sufficient aduice and mature deliberation. The seruant of God was immediately checkt he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewith, and very willingly obayed her Maister, in a matter very mainely repugnant to her inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but not her will, since now her will was growne to be wholy the same with that of his. Yet fearing she had done against the former Vow of Obedience, made vnto him, in offering to doe a thing contrary to his lyking, she craued pardon for it. Beseeching him she might presently take the secret habit belonging to the said <hi>Third Order,</hi> from the hands of the Guardian there present, and make her absolute profession thereof, in all their sights: and further for a more assurance on her part, desired she might likewise renew her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Vow of Obedience to him, Which was graunted.</p>

                  <p>SPiritual Children are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue three things, with their Superiours, and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual guides of their soule. First to loue them truly indeede as Fathers, and not to iudge their workes, but rather if their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, haue any apparance of euil in them, they are to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them with loue, and to seeke reasons to excuse them. They are also to haue compassion on
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:4116:136"/>
them, for the paynes they ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke in guiding them, in the way of perfection: and continually to implore at the hands of God, to afford them light, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, to gouerne, and direct them to the greater glory, and honour of his diuine Maiesty, and the good, and behoofe of their Subiects. Secondly, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence them as Fathers, who are in the place of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and are his Vicars as it were, and Vicegerents on earth. The third, is to obay him in al things, and by how much the thing commaunded bee dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically opposite to proper wil, so much the more is hee to enforce, and to vse violence with himself, to effectuate the same, vnderstanding the great merit which comes thereof. And especially to obserue these seauen conditions of perfect Obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce. The first, is to obay with
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:4116:136"/>
great promptnes, and readynes. Secondly, with a good wil. Thirdly, simply, blindly, and without reply. The fourth, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout sadnes, or rather with mirth, and very chearefuly. The fifth, with fortitude, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout impatience. The sixt with perseuerance. And the seauenth, and last, with humility.</p>
                  <p>These things this great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of God obserued very pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualy towards her Superiour, whom she had formerly cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, and whom his <hi>Holynes</hi> had now especially recommended to her, and lastly, whom she her self had accepted by a formal Vow on that behalf for her spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual guide. Hence it was, that louing her Maister dearely, and reuerencing him so highly as she did; being desirous to bee trayned vp, and practized in holy Obedience, which she could not wel exercise in his absence from
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:4116:137"/>
her. Hee then hauing vrgent, and necessary occasion to reside at <hi>Marpurge</hi> a cheife Citty in <hi>Hassia,</hi> the holy <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by no meanes would stay behind, but follow him to the same Citty. Where being arriued, fynding the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient enmity (as yet) not quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched which had vniuersally, and most iniuriously beene conceiued euery where against her: And hauing no howse there as yet conuenient for her, she left the Towne for a while to liue in the Countrey neare at hand, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing order to haue one built the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re according to her mynd. And for that, she would not be troublesome to any the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, she setled her self in the ruines of an old Palace thereby. Where fynding the shaft or tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of the chimney lying open to the foresaid Palace yard, she caused certaine prongs to be pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched some distance from the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:4116:137"/>
wal of the said chimney, and a sory beame to be laid a crosse, from thence she raysed very slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der poles insteede of rafters, to susteyne the reeds, thatch, and boughs she intended to lay vpon them, which she did as wel as she could, and so built her a howse, such as it was. Where so long as she made her aboade, we may imagine the many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodityes she suffered: partly by the smoake, partly by the heats, and sometymes againe by the wynd, and raine; where hardly blew any great blast but put her in feare of being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>howsed: al which discommodityes she chearefuly endured, stil praysing and magnifying God for al.</p>

more like an Angel in Paradice, then a Nouice in her new Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute. Whatsoeuer she heard or saw in any other, she euer would imagine, they spake or did them with a good intention, though the contrary rather appeared, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause humane iudgments, and suspitions, are easely deceiued. She despised none, nor spake any thing tending to her owne praise to any how familiar soeuer with whom she conuersed, not so much as with her owne Mayds, in whom notwithstanding she was very confident; but laboured rather to couer, and hide her vertues from them, then her vices. She listened more willingly to heare one prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, then to be dispraised neuer so litle. Whensoeuer she spake, her words were few, graue, and most commonly of God. When any se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular chaunced to speake any vay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and vnprofitable thing in her presence, she endeauoured to cut of the discourse, and apply<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it to

God, or diuert the speach some other way, til at last she had brought it to some pious matter of edification. She tooke little care for any thing that happened to her or others, nor would be troubled for Aduersities, or puffed vp with any Prosperities whatsoeuer; she set light by al things, and praised God in euery thing. She shunned al tatlers as much as might bee, as holding it better to hold her peace, then to speake sometymes, though to the purpose, out of a loue she had to religious silence.</p>
                  <p>If she noted any thing in an other which seemed not wel, she would consider with her self, whether she were not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the same vice; if she were, she would be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thereat, and if otherwise, giue thanks vnto God for it, and craue to bee deliuered from it: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby each thing became as a glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se vnto her.

thing, but al her affirmations, and denyals were as prudent doubts. She kept her self from al manner of laughing, or euen from smiling, vnles very seldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me on good occasions, and that with exceeding modesty, more like a forced, and fayned smile then open laughter. Finally al her words, and speaches were such as caused no doubts, suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, or iealousyes in any that heard them, but were alwayes very playne, and simple. Soe much for her words, and Tongue, the most difficult instrument of the rest to bee wel ordered, and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And now for her actions, and workes of her hands.</p>
                  <p>She was very hospitable, and charitable to the poore, now more then euer, as she arriued to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perfection, and knowledge, and consequently a more ardent loue of God, whom she cheifely regarded in her Neighbour, and for whose sake she respected him
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:4116:140"/>
wholy. She often visited the hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, which she had formerly built at her owne cost, stil cherishing the members of Christ, with al the comfort she was able to affoard them. And how beyt, she gaue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes in common to the poore, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her ability, yet she made perticular choyce besides, to place in her hospitals such, as eyther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled in the exercize of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, or els were the most infirme, and disabled of the rest. And many tymes she inuited to her owne table the most impotent, and miserable wretches of al, bidding them hartily welcome, and serued them likely from her owne tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and if any thing were more dainety, and choyce then other, she would be sure to share, and diuide it amongst them, wherein she estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med she fed Christ; and therefore no maruaile she was so respectful, and tender of them.</p>
                  <p>Now then the venerable <hi>Conrad</hi> seeing her manner, how she enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:4116:141"/>
such so familiarly to her owne Table, considering the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity of her person, esteemed it vnfitting; saying it was too much rusticity in her to do so, and that better it were to recommend such offices to others in her owne name, which would bee as acceptable to them, and perhaps more, while they could not bee so free with her, as with others. Wherefore it were much fitter for her to forbeare from them, and to addict her self vnto more solid vertues which had not so much of the extraordinary, and a kind of daungerous singularity in them. Whereat the reuerent Matron besought pardon of him, if she he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein had donne amisse, protesting indeede for her part, she found no such inconuenience therein of self complacence, vanity, and the like; but a great deale of submission, and lowlynes of heart, in that rather then any other wayes, and for any difficulty or auersion therein, she found none, nor the company of
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:4116:141"/>
such, gaue her any offence at al, but a great deale of sweetnes which hee might depriue her of, if it pleased him, and she would obey, affirming that her scope therin was, but to mortify her self, and to satisfie for her too much curiosity, nicenes, and dainetynes in those very things in her former life as holding that Euils were best cured by their contraryes. Whereat her Maister was silent, and thereby tacitly licenced her to do what she would, since therein be noted the Vnction of the Holy Ghost to worke in her, and that it were no discretion for him to debar her thereof. But intended to proue her in some other things for her greater spiritual aduancement.</p>

                  <p>TRue it is, that our perfection, consists not essentially in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, but in Charity rather, and in the ardent loue of God, and to say true, a Man is soe much the more perfect, as he is more vnited with God through loue. For euen as a stone remayning aloft, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the impediments away which hold it there, against its naturall inclination, presently hyes to the earth its proper center: soe our soule being a spirituall substance, and created for God, in taking away the letts and impediments of disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:4116:142"/>
appetites, and euil inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which dispose and encline it to things beneath, being presently assisted by diuine grace, goes dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly to God as to her Center, and last end, and through loue embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth him, and vnites her self with him. My weight is my loue, thither am I swayed whithersoeuer I am carryed. That which is the weight, in the elements, and natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, is Loue in rational creatures, and as natural things do moue dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newards according to the weight they haue: So the reasonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are moued according to the loue which predominates, and swayes in them: because indeede that same is the weight that belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges vnto them. Now then if the loue of things beneath predomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes in vs, and particularly the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite to priuate familiarity sway with vs, our motions, and desires shal be sensual, and enclining to the earth: But if wee vntye our selues

through mortificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the loue of all those sensuall things, the loue of the Creator shall rule in vs, and that shall bee our weight, and our hart shall presently fly vnto God with more lightnes and agility then a stone to its center.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore like a wise and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, perceiuing how <hi>Elizabeth</hi> with all her forces and endeauours, laboured to attayne to the highest pitch of all perfection, and that es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially by the workes of charity; thought himself to bee strictly bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in conscience, to haue an especiall care to promote such a subiect, the best he could, to some higher point of perfection, then he had hitherto done, as conceiuing now more highly then euer of her greater ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity and longer extent in spiritual matters, intending on his part, that nothing should be wanting to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the same, nor any impediment be put that might any wayes hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der greater aduancement in spirit.
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:4116:143"/>
While <hi>Conrad</hi> was in this serious deliberation with himself, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing what was fit to be done, he bethought him of a certaine thing, expedient to be practized with her for that end: and that was this.</p>
                  <p>His long experience now by this tyme, in guiding of soules, had let him see how great a hinderance it was in spiritual warfare, euen in the choysests spirits and best refined, to haue any priuate affections to any freind or acquaintance soeuer, not only in worldly conuersations, which infaillibly destroyes the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit quite, but euen in things directly spirituall, and wholy te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly matters. And therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the great loue and affection which passed betweene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and two of her Maydes aboue the rest, namely <hi>Isentrude</hi> and <hi>Guta,</hi> he thought it good to send for them both, and fairely deale with them about their remoue from their Lady
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:4116:144"/>
for certaine reasons of his, which he presumed they would not disallow of, if it were conuenient they should be acquainted therewith: in the meane tyme he wished them to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their wils and iudgments the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reunto, and they should be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise prouided for. The sober and discreet Maydes they had likewise, together with their Lady, as he knew, giuen vp themselues to his dispose, so as there remayned noe more for them to effect his will, then to know his pleasure. That saied, and they departed; he calls for <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her self, and told her his mynd very plainely, without any manner of circumlocutions or ambages at all, that his pleasure was, for some reasons which she was not to examine, or enter into, to dismisse presently two of her mayds: Who supposing it had beene to ease her of her charge of some that might seeme to him super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:4116:144"/>
replyed: She was ready to obey, but fayne would know who they were and vnderstanding, that <hi>Guta,</hi> and <hi>Isentrude</hi> were they, her coulour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered alitle to and fro, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably went and came, and presently againe hauing gathered, her spirits together, with a cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and serene countenance, gaue her consent, to haue the diuorce ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected out of hand, since it was his pleasure. They were therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately sent for in, to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, to whom <hi>Conrad</hi> very peremptorily deliuered the sentence of their separations from their Lady and Mistresse, not without the teares &amp; te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dernes of al partyes. For though the superiour parts were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed in all, yet were not the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour soe composed, as not to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their imbecillityes, saue only <hi>Elizabeth</hi> soone recollected her self againe, leauing her Maydes discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate, to see themselues depriued of the Solace they were wont to
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:4116:145"/>
receiue in her angelicall company and religious conuersation. For she well considered with her self, that Obedience consisted not in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour execution onely of the thing commaunded, but in the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity also of the will and Iudgment, with that which the Superiour willes and thinkes fitting, holding the foundation of Obedience to be a firme faith that the Superiour is ruled &amp; gouerned by God in what he commaunds, since he is in the place of God, and our sauiour Christ saith: who heareth you, heareth mee: and therefore is to be obayed in euery thing wherein noe sine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth. She remembred the saying of her Maister at other tymes, that a true obedient Child should carry himself as a dead body which hath neyther Vnderstanding nor will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Like a Crucifix which suffereth i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:4116:145"/>
recommended by Saints, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisted in this; that a man accomplish what he is commaunded to doe, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son onely that obedience co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunds and for that the Superiour stands in the place of God, without any other reason or discourse at all. And that, euen as in maters of faith, one yeilds and submittes himself for this cause onely, that God reueales, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers what is commended to bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiued, and for the onely authority of God, which is the highest truth: Soe likewise one obayes and eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>cts what the superious commaunds for this onely reason, that it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds of the Superiour, who is in the place of God, and that to obay him is to obay God, nor obayes hee for any other reason. For which cause, the same is called a Blind obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as the aforesaid faith is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Blind. Thus discoursed the holy Matron within her self vpon the act of Obedience which her Maister soe put her to; Which truely bred a most singular effect
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:4116:146"/>
in her. For being thus bereft of the comfort she formerly tooke in the sweete familiarity of those two Maydes, so gratefull to her, the riuer as it were soe dammed vp on euery side with churlish banckes, made the waters of spirituall graces to abound more in her, &amp; to mount vp to heauen with more facility. For as a pipe or Conduite which leakes in many places at once, discharges lesse waters into the Cesterne then otherwise it would; Which being stopt, deliuers them forth with a greater aboundance: Soe needes must the Soule being a copious Cesterne of heauenly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, appeare to be lesse redundant, and to yeild fewers acts of loue and charity to God, by how much more are the leakes of terren loue it is affected with. Which being heere stopt in the Seruant of Christ, made her to spring vp soe high to soe heroicall acts of eminent Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as she did heere vpon.</p>

                     <pb n="273" facs="tcp:4116:146"/>For after this, lyuing in great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty with her other Maydes, her foode but lettice and other hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

She receiued at the hands of her Maister a habit made of the coursest cloth, without any other dye then the naturall tincture, and a short cloake exceedingly patched with diuers colours, which cloake because it was held too short for her grauity, was afterwards lengthned
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:4116:147"/>
with an other peece of a differente colour. Whensoeuer she had neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, as sometymes she had to mend her owne clothes, she was soe vnskillfull in that art, as she might bee sayed rather to marre then to amend awhit. She was fayne to spinne wool, for want of skill to handle flax, wherewith she seemed to gayne her lyuing which was fare more gratefull to her, then all the pleasures of Princes: and to this kind of work, she applyed her selfe soe earnestly as that being sickly, and keeping her Bed, she would haue the rock and distaffe in her hand to spinne with, when she could hardly lift vp her head, which if her Maydes, as sometymes they would, had snatched out of her hands, to auoyd Idlenes she would prepare and dresse the same with Garding or the like, and spinne it afterwards in better health, and being sorupulous, would abate some part of the price she was to haue, as fearing and

Nor may wee thinke she did these things out of a base and deiected mynd: for while she was thus lowly spinning in the Chimney Corner, her mynd would bee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templating most high &amp; sublime points, of the huswiuery our Lady vsed in her humble <hi>Nazareth,</hi> What <hi>Ioseph</hi> did the while she was spinning, and what the Infant <hi>Iesus</hi> did, when they both were soe busily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. She would meditate how vnworthy she was to haue dressed vp our Ladyes worke for her, how gladly she would haue carded or reeled for her, and a thousand such conceipts she reuolued in mynd, and yet her hands, her head, and body were as busy, as she had myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded naught, but what she was doing.

                  <p>In the meane while, <hi>Elizabeth</hi> now deliuered of the earnest impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunityes of the solicitous Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, considering with what indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, &amp; diligence those of the world endeauour to go forward, &amp; aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce themselues more, and more, &amp; to make themselues more excellent in any manner of profession as of Learning, Armes, or the like, and how a rich man the more he hath, the more he couets to haue, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours more to make his gaine, and all for fraile and transitory goods: she bethought her self how much rather she should addict her self to the purchase of celestiall and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall goods: And therefore knowing of what auayle the Workes of

                     <hi>Charity</hi> were, &amp; especially of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility: She now applyed her self to acts of humiliation more then euer. And her singular humility, &amp; fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity was such with her Maydes at home, as she made her selfe their equal at least, if not inferiour, so as to lay aside the name of Lady or Mistresse, she would onely be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by them by her proper name, and that as familiarly as, they vse to style it.</p>

as the Sunne, in the kingdome of their heauenly Father, Citizens among the Saints, and Dearest to God, and might behold there, as so many Aultars of incense, as so many Kings of glorie, and so many Organs to praise and exalt the most holy <hi>Trinity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The deepe apprehension no doubt of these things, had bred that enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Charity she felt in her self, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing, assisting, and comforting her Neighbour in al distresses. This made her, when she went to visit the poore, in their owne howses, (as often she did;) to be allwayes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by one or other, to carry along with her sundry sorts of al kind of prouisions, as meate, drinke, and clothes for the purpose, not omitting the while, fit medecins for the sick, as she vnderstood they were in need; and would minister to them with her ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne hands, and deale &amp; distribute to the poore, what necessary things she had brought with her, and accordingly examine their apparel and other neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saryes,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:4116:156"/>
for their howses, as bedds, sheetes, couerlets, and blanckets, and euer supply what was wanting, if she had wherewithal; and if she had it not, she would prouide it for them, by selling her rings of gold, her bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celets, and iewells, which stil she had for the same purpose; so as she was forced at last to sel with much disaduantage, certaine apparel she wore in former tymes, as yet left her, to furnish them with things which she held to bee simply needeful for them.</p>
                  <p>Amid these spoyles which she made so of her owne goods, she being now exhausted, not hauing wherewith to ful-fil the suite and humble request of a poore man, who begged but a sory fish at her hands, on a certaine day of abstinence; she made her prayer to Christ very anxiously for him; when arising from prayer, whether it were that she expected what followed, as the fruits and effect thereof, or that otherwise she had neede of some water for some vses of hers, I cannot say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="296" facs="tcp:4116:157"/>
but she going to the Spring to draw thereof, where no fish at al could bee any wayes expected, she fetched vp one in her bucket, for the satisfying of the hunger, or the longing of the poore man: this is certaine she drew vp the fish, and giuing it to him, sent him away exceedingly wel satisfyed. And verily it is thought she had done the like before and after diuers tymes, which stil for humility she sought to conceale, but could not now do it in his presence; who doubtles went away satisfyed, praysing the works of God, being so miraculously fed through the prayers and merits of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the great Seruant of God.</p>
                  <p>Her <hi>Charity</hi> likewise much appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a certaine difficult thing; for being a woman of that condition as she was, so delicately bred vp, as she had beene; tooke vpon her to tend an Orphan, sick of many irksome and greiuous diseases at once, as of the palsey, catarrhe, and bloody flux, so as very often in the night, she was
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:4116:157"/>
fayne to take vp the child, in her tender armes, not being otherwise able to wield it self; and did it with such willingnes and alacrity, as asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished such as were witnesses the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof; and to shew that she did it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry freely and willingly indeed; when as after notwithstanding the care she had, the Child dyed; as if she had lost some notable benefit by its death; she was not quiet til she had priuily taken to her charge, to tend a certayne Mayd wholy destitute and forlorne, and sorely infected with a greiuous leaprosy, whom she serued with such <hi>Charity,</hi> as she not only dressed her meate, made her bed, and fetched her water to wash her hands, but being so great a personage, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned not to abase her self euen to the ground to pul off her hose and shooes, and the like. Which when the venerable <hi>Conrad</hi> vnderstood; considering the loathsommes of that disease, and the daintynes of her complexion, he gaue on the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:4116:158"/>
suddaine expresse order, the leaprous Mayd should be remoued thence, and the Lady debarred from comming at her, prouiding otherwise for the party.</p>
                  <p>Though <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by some, might wel be thought to be throughly mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified herein, to be so peremptorily barred of her wil, (as they might imagine) in so pious a thing, she ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing as it appeared, so seriously set her mynd thereon, yet in truth it troubled not her awhit, for weighing with herself, that charitable acts, how great soeuer, do loose their vertue and efficacy, if they be not discreete withal, she was satisfyed with the wil of her Superiour, whom God had appointed ouer her. For she considered indeede that true Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity principally required two things: First, not to content our selues with the only shadow of Charity, which is sweete and tender feeling towards the Neighbour, but such an effect alsoe, as properly bereaues a man of al self-loue, as not to seeke nor mind
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:4116:158"/>
any thing but the glory of God, and to ful-fil his blessed wil, And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer any wayes befalls him, eyther interiourly or exteriourly, to accept from the hand of God, in doing al to his greater glory, and not to seeke what is pleasing to himself, but what is most agreeable to the wil of God. The second is, that howbeyt the Loue of God can not be so great, but that stil he is worthy of much greater, yet are the exteriour works and practizes thereof, to be measured with a certaine moderation of discretion, least being neglected, they hurt either our owne health, or hinder the edification of our neighbour. And therefore she wisely considered, there was no greater se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity herein, then wholy to stand to the iudgmens of her lawfull Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour. Who if he grant and afford vs, to do lesse then wee willingly would do, yet shal a supple and plyable mynd herein, relinquishing its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per wil, bee a great deale more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teful to God, then the hardest and
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:4116:159"/>
most difficult thing that may be enterprized, without the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fignation.</p>
                  <p>Yet could not <hi>Elizabeth</hi> forbeare, such was her Charity, to receiue a Boy into her charge, whose head was al become bald, by reason of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

lame, some blind, some deaf, some Orphans, some Widowes, and some aged persons, and some with their whole familyes at once, as hauing noe resting or abiding place. There might you see a mother carying one child on her back, and an other hang clinging to her breast. A child leading his blind father, and the father ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying his lame child. The lame who had his eyes, but wanted limmes, was caryed and susteyned by him who had his limmes but not his eyes, being guided by him that sate aboue.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Elizabeth</hi> therefore appointed some, both men and women to keepe good order, in the distribution of the almes she intended to giue, and to cause the multitude to sit downe in certaine files and rancks, and to quiet them if they chaunced to tumultuat among themselues, as vsually such people do, complayning of each other for the lightest cause, and many times without any cause at al; she prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed a penalty of a publique con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, to the faulty and delinquents, by cutting off the hayre of any who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer should once presume to goe forth of their place, while the dole was made, or were noted to molest their fellowes any wayes, or to offer to take a double almes, to the preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the rest, who might happily want by such an abuse.</p>
                  <p>Besides these poore, were present likewise an innumerous multitude of other people to behold the sight,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:4116:168"/>
whom the rarenes thereof had moued to come and view the same. When this religious Comforter of the poore would walke among the midst of the rancks distributing the monyes her self, which howbeit she might wel haue recommended to others, yet such was the pleasure she tooke the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein, as she could not be satisfyed, if she did it not with her owne hands; doing herein like the careful and sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous husbandman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who though he trust others to plow his land, yet wil hee sow the seede himself: being wel aduised, that <hi>who sowes sparingly shal as sparingly reape, and who shal sow in benedictions, shal reape in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictions.</hi> And this she did with so pleasant and cheareful a countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, as wel demonstrated the confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce she had of her future haruest in the next life.

In which distributions at one tyme only, she spent little lesse then fiue hundred pounds sterling, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible releife of a world of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</p>
                  <p>When lo the dole was ended, and the company were now broke vp, they returned to their homes, al pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing God with hymnes and Canticles of ioy, and magnifying this his trusty Stewardesse &amp; faithfull Dispensatress<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Although a man would verily haue thought, to haue seene the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse largesse of this incomparable Stewardesse of Christ, shee might wel haue sate downe with what shee had already done: Yet as one but now to begin, and who as yet had done nothing to the purpose; shee had a good mynd with the like boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to haue disposed to the releife
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:4116:173"/>
of the poore, the remaynder of her portion stil in her hands; whereof shee was to liue and sustayne her self: shee was so extreamely enamoured of that vertue, and so wonderfully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to the needy and necessitous people. And surely shee had done so indeed, had not the Reuerend Father and Guide of her soule, her dearest Maister, preuented her in taking care for her temporaltyes: and therefore wisely foreseeing and prouiding for future necessityes, forbad her the same with a strickt commaund, making vse of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute power and authority he had ouer her; appointing some hard and seuere persons to accompany her alwayes, and to obserue very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently all her actions, and to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate to him and complayne of her, if shee obayed not his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to wit, if shee were obserued to passe her stint assigned her, in dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling almes.</p>
                  <p>An order was taken, that if any

Which fault when shee had once committed, and accordingly been punished, shee was commaunded to distribute no more then a penny at once to a poore body. Wherein with a pious breach, and yet a litteral obseruance, shee so obeyed her Maister, as shee neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les gaue reasonable satisfaction to her tender and merciful mind.

to fewer in greater peeces: Which when her Maister once perceiued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause shee obeyed not his wil therein, he forbad her to giue any more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and onely permitted her to giue Bread, which when shee began to deale more bountyfully then he would haue her, he restrayned her to giue peeces of bread only, whereas before shee had dealt whole loaues at once to seueral persons, and so with a wonderful variety, was both Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience exercised in her, and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion prouoked.</p>
                  <p>If shee had beene commaunded at any tyme to refrayne from giuing of almes or to meddle with leaprous or diseased persons, or else to discharge and dismisse such as shee had already<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der to see how vpon a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, her coulour would goe and come, as shee had verily beene in a strange dilemma what to do; When indeede it would bee no more but a terrible conflict in her self betweene the superiour and inferiour part of her soule, or the soueraigne power
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:4116:175"/>
which Obedience exercised vpon her owne inclination to communicate her meanes to the poore, and to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise such works of piety. So as now and then, shee would bee in such a perplexity of mind thereat, as the good Father knew not what to do in the case. For one while he feared least the disquiet of her mynd shee felt therewith might bring her into some inconuenience of her health, which was the thing he doubted so much, by dealing so boldly with such lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous people; otherwhile againe he would feare as much, least her exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue liberality would bring al to naught, and he be blamed for guiding her no better. And lastly otherwhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les but very tenderly he began to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect her promptnes in Obedience, that found such maine opposition inthe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour part of her soule: til weighing the matter with more deliberation, he found it to be rather an emulous strife between two noble and eminent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in her: of Charity to the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and Charity to God; Piety to the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:4116:176"/>
poore, and a perfect Obedience to her Superiour. And therefore commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the matter to God from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth he was resolued in those things to leaue her to the vnction of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> to inspire and direct her in the best.</p>
                  <p>Which liberty, as shee perceiued to be afforded her from her Maister, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring shee had violated the Lawes of Obedience, and that her Maister had beene fayne to condescend to her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmityes, shee resolued with her self thenceforth, shee would be more exact, precise, and punctual, not only to obey him to the letter, but euen likewise to the vtmost extent of his intention, as neare as shee was able to interpret the same. Wherein doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les shee made a notable conquest of her self, considering her pious incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to works of Charity; so to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molate the same on the Aultar of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, as shee did afterwards. And therefore henceforth shee contented her self with such works of Charity only, as were not only, not expressely
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:4116:176"/>
forbidden her, but likewise such as shee might imagin, he intended to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in his prohibitions and iniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions giuen her. And so shee went with her Mayds to the Hospital to tend the sick, not infected with lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosy, and washed them, and made their bedds for them, and couered them as they lay. And would often say to her Mayds whom shee made as her fellowes in these occasions: How hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are wee, <hi>Sisters,</hi> who haue the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

meanes to reclayme her from that coldnes and tepidity in the seruice of God in his weak and feeble mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</p>
                  <p>Vpon a certaine Woman great with child and neare her tyme, shee bestowed hous-roome and al necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry furniture for her childbirth, and shee being deliuered of a daughter, newly borne; shee caused it to be Christened, and baptised by the name of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and likewise daylie visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the woman in childbed, and stil carryed some good dish of meate or other with her, to comfort her withall. But at length this ingrateful woman being now recouered and brought to a perfect state of health, togeather with her husband, with one consent, ran quite away from her, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their litle daughter behind them, to the mercy, of the charitable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, taking some part of the furnitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re with them, that was but lent them for the tyme only. Whereof when the Seruant of God had notice giuen her, by her Mayd whom shee had sent
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:4116:177"/>
vnto her, with a good dish of meate; shee presently commaunded the child to be brought to her, and put it forth to be nursed by a souldiours wife a neighbour by: When sending imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly to the Gouernour of the Citty, hee caused a diligent search and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit to bee made for those wretched vagabonds. But when they could not be found, the holy woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke her self to her prayers, and so caused them shortly to returne against their wills, and to begge pardon very humbly on their knees, for their great ingratitude and prodigious impiety: affirming they had been very misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly punished already, in that, through the iust iudgment of God, they were not able to passe any further, but were constreyned in spite of their harts to returne againe. The fault was soone pardoned by the blessed woman, with condition to take their child againe: and so they were both restored to her fauour. But yet in some manner of penance for their heynous delict, shee tooke away from her
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:4116:178"/>
a cloake which shee had giuen her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, saying: that an iniury was so to be pardoned, as the same might not come to bee offered any more. Which cloake shee presently bestowed on a poore Mayd at hand; who through the merits of the Saint, was so i'lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined thereby with the grace of God, as shee vowed immediatly thereupon, perpetual Virginity, and obserued the same to her dying day, leading a most vertuous life.</p>

the Reliques of Saints, with tapers &amp; incense according to the custome of good Christians, piously offering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the money shee had earned her self, with her handy works, most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently on the Aultar.

singular gift from God. For as shee wept shee disfigured not her face a whitt as others are wont, through excesse of dolour, but with a cheare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and pleasant countenance testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed and expressed comforts and great consolations the while. And the teares shee let fal in her latter ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, were accompanyed rather with smiles then sighes, or groanes, soe as shee seemed to weepe, rather then to greiue and lament. And no marueile, for her countenance vpon no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of mis-fortune would euer change or alter a whitt, but alwayes keepe the same tenour of chearefull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and serenity with it.</p>
                  <p>Nor may wee imagin shee arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to this soe high perfection of Prayer at once, but ascended thereto by certaine degrees. For first, shee only began to haue a liuely desire of perfection and Loue of God. Secondly, shee stirred vp and excited her self to attaine this perfection with acts of desire and
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:4116:181"/>
Loue, and from sighs euen fetcht from the inward of the hart still crauing of our Lord this perfection and loue. Thirdly shee had a continuall watch vpon all her thoughts, words, and works, not to offend and displease God in whatsoeuer, being still present to her self in all affayres, &amp; not suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her hart to bee carryed and distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with them. Fourthly, shee would deale very really indeede to obteyne Vertues, practizing and exercizing some acts of them in particular things, nor euer ceased till shee had gotten a facility and habit in them. Fiftly, shee would take her sustenance and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall foode very sparingly, no more then would serue to maintayne life, &amp; to comply with her necessary obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations; but herein shee would not bee too extreame but ruled and guided by her Maisters direction, especially after shee had once submitted her self to his Obedience. Sixtly, shee attended with great care to the mortification of her disordinate affections, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to the abnegation of her self
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:4116:181"/>
and her Wil and inclinations good or ill, wherein as I haue saied aboue, shee found any difficulty; as in the points of dealing almes more profusely then shee ought, and doing some speciall mortifications shee affected most, to wit, with medling with leapers to the hazard of her health, and the like. Seauenthly, shee had her interiour &amp; exteriour powers exceedingly recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and especially her fiue senses, that they might not bee scattered and dispersed on creatures. And for her thoughts, and memory, likely shee would busy and imploy them in the Meditation of the Last things, and of the iudgments of God.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, shee would put before her eyes the imitation of the Life of our Sauiour Christ, and his Saints; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming her life as much as shee could with their liues, in doing sharp pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances as they: discouering her soule entirely to her Maister, or spirituall Guide, not concealing any thing either good or bad, which shee did not manifest to him: that shee might

be the more secure from all illusions and deceites of the common enemy. Shee held with herself a certaine norm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Her thoughts were alwayes of the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of this life, and how the same continually went drawing to its end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for which cause it behoued her to goe with a continuall watch and examen vpon all her life and actions, walking euer in perpetuall prayer in the presence of God: all which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from her much retirement as from a riuer and fountaine. And this prayer shee would vsually make of the mysteries of the Life, Passion, and Death of our Redeemer, whence her soule would receiue particular light of the verities and mysteries of our holy Faith, &amp; illustratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne feelings, which shee concealed and discouered not to any but her Maister.

                  <p>When shee had made this prayer, shee concluded and fell vpon a large discourse, how Christ went to visit <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha</hi> in their mourning for their Brothers death, how he sweetely comforted them, how he reared their hopes with his firme pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, how they went altogeather to the monument, and finally how he shed teares, in testimony of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and tender compassion. And here now entring vpon this passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, into a deepe and profound dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course

of so worthy a subiect, to the great astonishment and admiration of all there present, her affects of the teares of Christ were so effectuall, so vrgent, so enflamed, and so pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, euen to the bottome of their harts, as made them all to weepe most tenderly, being strucken to the hart, and greiued, that shee was to leaue them, and they to bee depriued of so holy and so gracious a Mother.</p>
                  <p>To whom <hi>Elizabeth</hi> turning her self, said. Good Christians weepe not for mee, but rather for your selues. And more shee vttered not, but they heard a most sweete and delicious harmony, without any motion of her lips, and yet as a voyce procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from her. And when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany enquired what that singing was, shee answeared.

Preists, and poore people had recour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se to her funerall seruice. Where the poore so filled the eyes and eares of all there present with mourning gestures and clamorous outcryes; as made all the rest to weepe who saw them, affirming all with one accord, they had lost a mercyfull Mother in their great extreamity, &amp; their onely freind and surest refuge on earth, that now they had noe more helpe or succour left them, since they knew not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to goe for releife, or whither to fly for comfort in distresse. The bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryall of this sacred body, was diferred vntill the fourth day after, by reason of the incredible concourse of deuout people who flocked thither from all parts. Nor moued it any horrour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whit, to see her face, head, and hands bare (it being the custome there to bury in their habits,) since besides the palenes they had, there was nothing ghastly or hideous in them, the same softnes and tendernes of flesh remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning still which was before, yeilding to the least touch of the fingar.</p>

<pb n="360" facs="tcp:4116:190"/>
furnace of the Loue of God in her breast: And for the Loue of the Neighbour, it was so great, as none could euer find in her, but bowells fraught with a tender loue and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of their case. The second Spice, a most profound <hi>Humility</hi> in her, which was so great, as before her Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, especially her Master, shee was as an Infant: For with how much <hi>Humility</hi> would shee heare others speake of spiritual matters, yea euen her Mayds, to whom otherwise shee was a Mistresse, and they her scholers. And for her exercise of abiect things, as appeares in her life, shee was wholy in them. The third aromatique Spice, was a rare <hi>Obedience</hi> in her, whereof though I might alleadge many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that of conquering her self, in so difficult a point, as wee haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, may stand for many; where shee resigned her self, and refreyned from certaine pious things forbidden by her Maister. The Fourth, was a high and most sublime <hi>Prayer,</hi> wherein through the Gift of God shee proceeded so
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:4116:190"/>
farre as would require a speciall trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise to set it downe. This only, that dwelling first as it were <hi>in Foraminibus Petrae,</hi> and alwayes digging in the wounds of her Sauiour in his Passion, shee attayned at last the highest points of Contemplation, and was frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rapt in spirit, as wee haue saied, where shee saw such things as were not to bee told. The Fift, was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual interiour and exteriour <hi>Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of her Sences and passions. For immediatly in her actions, would appeare how present shee was to her self. And what a martyrdome there was in her proper wil, which God alone could throughly know.

                  <p>Then were the Reliques safely enclosed againe in a leaden Coffer, and the same very softly included in a precious casket of most curious workmanship, besides the stuffe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which I could not learne by reason the enamel had so disguised the same:

And heere behold the first <hi>primitias</hi> of the future wonders which I shal rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te.</p>

likewise to the sick and infirme, euen after death, shee distilled no lesse her very marrow and substance; her bones as it were resoluing into oyle, the truest symbole of mercy; yssuing forth sweate and trickled downe by drops on euery side of the Casket; which as many as were there present, might wel perceiue; who piously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing it as it flowed, and reseruing it for the sick, thereby cured al those whom they annoynted therewith.</p>
                  <p>The second miracle happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bones were euer translated, as is for certaine registred from the partyes owne report, to whom it happened, and confirmed by oath. That a certaine Monke of the Order of the <hi>Cisterce,</hi> hauing beene gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously tormented for the space of fortie yeares togeather with a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the hart; and vsing all the meanes that possibly he could, with the furtherance of Superiours for remedy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in vayne, and now who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly despayring of humane helps: at

Then hee in the absence of he Abbot and Prior who were then from home at that tyme, consulted with his immediat Superiour, and so very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally made his vow: When lo, the next night, the same Woman appeared againe, making the signe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Especially knowing wel that no Monk had power of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self alone to make a vow; &amp; therefore it were better, &amp; more secure for him

to make his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession excusing himself of the wow, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit his soule to God, and his body to the Monastery.

<pb n="386" facs="tcp:4116:203"/>
appeared in one <hi>Henry</hi> of the said Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, who by visiting <hi>Saint Elizabeths</hi> Tomb, was first cured of his blindnes, and then after, of a desperate disease, by taking in his drink, the dust only of the said Tomb.

Al which is most true and authentically registred in writing. The fourteenth, was a woman in the same Territory of <hi>Treuers,</hi> who being blind a whole yeare, and praying to <hi>Saint Elizabeth,</hi> and led to her Tomb, receiued there the sight of one of her eyes, but the other was not restored her vntil shee returned home, where the blessed <hi>Sainct Elizabeth</hi> appeared to her in the night, and wished her to goe to the Aultar, and desire one to moue the ayre towards her, with the silk veyle where the Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> was wont to be placed, which being done, she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the benefit of both her eyes.

Finally to conclude this relation of the admirable Miracles of this great <hi>S.

This <hi>Theodorick</hi> then being lame of both his leggs, made a vow to visit <hi>S. Elizabeth,</hi> and ariuing thither, partly by creeping, and partly through the help of other men, not hauing remedy thereof in a whole moneths space, returned homewards againe as leysurely as he went thither, and being yet in his way, and sleeping by the sides of an other, as infirme and diseased as himself, thought verily in the night some water had bin powred vpon him, and waking thereupon, complayned of his fellow, as one who had cast some water vpon him in his sleepe. But he discreetely coniecturing the thing, as in truth it happened, denyed the same, perswading him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there was something els in the matter, more then he perhapps would imagin,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:4116:204"/>
and therefore aduised him to arise and try whether happily he could walke or noe. When behold a maruellous thing, hee, who we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t so lame to bed, arose ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sound &amp; whole, so as laying aside his crutches, whereas before he was wont to beare &amp; susteyn himself with them, he could now carry them lustily, as he did to the Tomb of the <hi>Saint;</hi> which done, he returned home to his freinds very ioyful of the benefit receiued, nor euer ceased to magnify God in this Great <hi>Saint.</hi>

You remayning perpetually a Virgin, saw yet the fruit of your Womb; and shee with the affect of Chastity had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise hers. Thirdly. You persecuted by <hi>Herod</hi> fled into <hi>Egipt</hi> with your litle child, &amp; she persecuted by <hi>Henry</hi> with her children likewise was thrust out of doores. You Queen of Angells liued in <hi>Nazareth</hi> in a slender howse: and shee Princesse of <hi>Thuringia</hi> at <hi>Marpurg</hi> in a poore houell. Finally, you the Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and Protectresse of all, that come running for succour: And she had not the hart to send any vnsatisfyed away, but was the Mother of Orphans, the Phisitian to the sick, Chirurgie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the lame, a staffe to the aged, Cloth to the naked, bread to the hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gry, a storehouse of al prouision for the poore &amp; needy:

                  <p>This leaue allowed mee now to goe so high, giues mee a confidence to goe yet higher: to find resemblances, as in the Mother, so likewise in the Sonne. Now then to end with her, where he began. Hee at his Natiuity into this world, had an Angel singing as he lay in the Crib: and shee at her Natals, her Natiuity into the next, had an Angel li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewise singing by her bed side. Hee wept in entring into this vale of mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: shee sung in going forth. His An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel tuned &amp; first gaue the tone, saying <hi>Glory to God aboue, &amp; peace to men of good will:</hi> and hers glory to God, and peace vnto her Soule. An host of Angels ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his Guiuer: &amp; so there did to her. This only differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was, she sung with them againe, he wept, and cryed as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants vse to doe in their birth. Shee in conuenient tyme was baptized with water: and hee with his proper blood in circumcision.

himself and of his own power: and shee by his, as a meer participation from him. Say we then with confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, if <hi>Iesus</hi> Christ the Spouse of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> wrought Miracles. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> likwise the Spouse of <hi>Iesus</hi> wrought Miracles. If he cured the sick and infirme; euen so did shee. if he gaue eyes to the blind, feete to the Lame, and blood to the withered arme; so did shee.

Thus doe wee see how neere this <hi>Saint</hi> resembled and approached her dearest Spouse, &amp; so neere that I may say yet more, that they seeme to be as One, since shee being vnited with him, was One and the self same in spirit with him, so Deifyed in a sort: where I leaue her adoring the blessed <hi>Trinity,</hi> shee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing through a diuine and Seraphicall Loue ascended so by the ladder afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said from the lowest state of a Coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
