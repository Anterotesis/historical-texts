            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3459:5"/>
this man was one of the eight. The King therefore had him for his ſlave, and after two moneths paſſed him over to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; by whom hee was ſold to a <hi>Negro.</hi> That <hi>Negro</hi> uſed him moſt cruelly: and by daily threatnings and ſoare beatings forced him to renounce his Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, denie <hi>Chriſt,</hi> acknowledge <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> to bee a great <hi>Prophet,</hi> and in teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony thereof to bee circumciſed and to conforme himſelfe to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> rites, and attire.

<q>He was loſt, and is found.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe five <hi>Parts</hi> might eaſily be ſubdivided into ſundry other particulars.</p>

            <p>The particulars moſt obſervable are two.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Dammage of <hi>Apoſtacy, He was loſt.</hi> For when he went out of his Fathers houſe he proved an Apoſtate. His Fathers houſe was the Church, wherein alone were the meanes of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: and out of which he had no hope of ſalvation, but was in that broad way that leadeth to deſtruction. Thus was he <hi>filius perditus,</hi> a loſt child. A great dammage indeed was this.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Advantage of Penitency. <hi>He is found.</hi> By ſight and ſence of his ſinne, by an humble acknowledgement thereof, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to his Fathershouſe, he ſhewed himſelfe a true Penitent: and by his Fathers receiving
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3459:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him into his houſe, and giving him ſuch well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as he did, he was under the meanes of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation againe. Thus was he <hi>filius inventus.</hi> A child whom his Father enjoyed. As great an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage was this to the Sonne, as joy to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

               </note>Before I proceed in a diſtinct handling of theſe two particulars, I suppoſe it to be meet to ſet before you a generall view of the whole: and that as it conſiſts of two oppoſite termes, LOST, FOVND; but made to agree by two different <hi>tences</hi> or times, WAS, IS. <hi>He</hi> WAS <hi>loſt, and</hi> IS <hi>found.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He</hi> WAS, <hi>He</hi> IS; Theſe are the two diſtinct and different times.</p>

            <p>The latter, <hi>He</hi> IS, points at the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: and that is his new-borne eſtate.</p>
            <p>Thus he is here ſet out unto us, not in that condition which the Prophet deſcribeth in theſe words,<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.24.</note> 
               <hi>When the righteous turneth away from his righteouſneſſe, and committeth iniquity, and doth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doth, ſhall he live? All his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that he hath done ſhall not be mentioned.

For conſtancy of Martyrs unto death (of ſuch Martyrs as profeſſe the name of Chriſt and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for his Truth) is a great honour unto Chriſt. Is it not an high honour to a King to have ſuch Captaines and Champions as will not yeeld to their Soveraignes enemies, but ſtand it out to the uttermoſt till they get the victory, though it coſt them their life to get it? Yet no mortall King can (as Chriſt doth) put ſpirit, courage, or ſtrength into a ſubject: onely it is conceived that ſuch valourous ſouldiers as are ready to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard their lives for their Soveraigne, ſerve a good Maſter.

               <p>In this doctrine ye are diſtinctly to obſerve, firſt the ſure Ground-worke or Foundation, <hi>Penitency:</hi> and then the faire ſtructure of buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding reared thereupon, <hi>A reſtoring to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

For to proclaime pardon to an impenitent, or to put an Apoſtate into the ſtate of ſalvation without true, ſound, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent repentance, is to play the part of a fooliſh builder, that <hi>without a foundation builds an houſe on the earth: againſt which the ſtreame did beate vehemently and immediately it fell and the raine of that houſe was great, Luk.</hi> 6.49. If the ſtreame of temptation doe in any kind vehemently beate againſt the conſcience of ſuch a deceitfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, his vaine hope of ſalvation is like to turne into <hi>a certaine fearefull looking for of judgement.</hi> By experience we find that a deepe wound haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ely skinn'd over before it be throughly ſearched and clenſed, is like to feſter, and to proove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable: So Apoſtacy or any other like ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous and notorious ſinne, being ſoothed, and ſmoothed over with undue hope of mercy and pardon, before thorow humiliation of the ſoule, great contrition of the heart, free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the mouth, and due ſatisfaction to the Church, which are all branches of true peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, may proove unpardonable.</p>
