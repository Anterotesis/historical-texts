            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>TIs the just Prerogative of true Greatness to be universally admir'd by all; and one so Eminently possest of it as your Grace, can no more escape the Tribute of our Praise and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, than you can cease to deserve it; not that 'tis in the power of any one, or even the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause of Multitudes, to reach half your Merit, yet may we be allow'd, according to the proportion of our poor stock, to throw in our Mite; and not be frightned from the hopes of your Grace's Patronage, by considering the unworthiness of the Offering; for were none but worthy Offerings made, the Gods themselves wou'd lose their Sacrifice; and they that deserve most our Praise shou'd have it least, because 'tis hardest to give them their due.</p>
            <p>And 'tis impossible, my Lord, this Poem shou'd find Sanctuary any where but in the umbrage of your favour, for the Eyes of all Mankind are so fixt upon your Grace, that 'twou'd be a disappointment to the publick to lay at any others door, what is so much your due. And tho I hit not a <hi>Wildair</hi> for
<pb facs="tcp:98224:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the humour of the Town in my Play, I may boldly say I have copied the greatest part of mankind in the Just Admiration of your Grace.</p>
            <p>Your particular Art, in appearing Free, Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and Conversible, without quitting a Noble Greatness proper to your self, makes us at once ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach you with Freedom and with Awe: Your Goodness, that makes you stoop to your Inferiours, loses nothing by being view'd near at hand, but is the more admir'd for it; and thus we consider your Grace arriv'd at the height of Greatness, without a mortifying reflection on the lowness of our own condition; nor does the world envy the truly Great, who by their Goodness and Affability make Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind partake of their Felicity.</p>
            <p>I may plead Prescription in excuse of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, and tell how Poets in all ages have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a Right to lay their Works at some Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's feet; but I'd rather submit to your Grace's Goodness; for if I have offended, 'tis a fault of the best kind, and proceeds from too much Zeal to let the World know how much I am,</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>I Should not trouble my Reader with a Preface, if Mr <hi>Collier</hi> had taught Manners to <hi>Masks,</hi> Sense to <hi>Beaux,</hi> and Good Nature to <hi>Criticks,</hi> as well as Morality to the Stage; the first are sure to envy what they can't equal, and condemn what they don't understand; the Beaux usually take a greater liberty with our sex than they wou'd with their own, because there's no fear of drawing a Duel upon their hands; the latter are a sort of rude splenatick Men, that seldom commend any thing but what they have had a hand in. These Snarling Sparks were pleas'd to carp at one or two Expressions, which were spoken in an Aside by one of the Inferiour Characters in the Drama; and without considering the Reputation of the persons in whose mouths the language is put, condemn it strait for loose and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure: Now (with submission to better Judges) I cannot believe that a Prayer-Book shou'd be put into the hands of a woman, whose Innate Vertue won't secure her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; nor is it reasonable to expect a person, whose Inclinations are always forming projects to the dishonour of her Husband, shou'd deliver her Commands to her Confident in the words of a Psalm. I, heartily wish that those that find fault with the liberty of my stile, wou'd be pleas'd to set a Pattern to the Town, by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching some of their Debaucheries, for Modesty thrives best by Example. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Language from the truly Vertuous is expected, I mean such as will neither act ill, nor suffer ill to be acted: It is not enough that <hi>Lucy</hi> says she's honest, in having denied the Brutal part; who ever thinks Vertue centers in that, has a wrong no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; no, Vertue is a tender Plant, which cannot live in tainted ground; Vertue is what the air of Flattery cannot blast, nor the vile sordid dross of Gain poyson; and she that can withstand these two shocks may be stil'd truly vertuous. I ask my Reader's pardon for my bluntness, but I hope none of my Sex so qualified will condemn me for exposing the Vices of the seeming Religious.</p>
            <p>I fear there is but too many hit by the Character of Signora <hi>Pizalta;</hi> I wish for the sake of the reverse party there were fewer, or they better known, since the malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous world are so apt to judge of peoples Inclinations by the company they keep; which is sometimes Authentick, but not always an Infallible Rule. I shall say little in Justification of the Play, only desire the Reader to judge impartially, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it by the shroeness of its Life, since the season of the year ne're promis'd much better success. It went off with general Applause; and 'tis the opinion of some of our best Judges, that it only wanted the Addition of good Actors, and a full Town, to have brought me a sixth night, there having been worse Plays within this twelve-month approv'd of.</p>

                     <p>Madam, I did; I found him in his study read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lover's Watch, which he swears does not at all agree with his Constitution. He hates injunctions of Love, like those of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: For the one, says he, is no more pleasurable to the Body, than the other beneficial to the Soul.</p>

                     <p>What a fine Gallant I'm like to have with these Principles! Well, — what did he say to a Summons from a Woman of my Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity? Did it not make him wish the Time of Assignation were sooner than the appointment in the Letter?</p>

                     <speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
                     <p>He first hum'd over your Billet; and pausing a while, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd me to stay for an Answer in a next Room; Then coming to me, he ask'd me what Countrywoman you were? For, said he, if she should prove an old Acquaintance, I would use her damnably — But when I had assur'd him you never saw the outside of these Walls, he began to have that desire which all men have to a new Face.</p>

                     <p>He strait enquir'd whether you were black, brown, fair, old, young, maid, wife or widow? I told him you was a wretched Wife to an old, impotent, rich, covetous, noble <hi>Venetian;</hi> beautiful, young, generous, and of a fair Complexion. He hugg'd me at these words, seem'd transported with the News, and swore that in intriguss a Wife was most suitable to his Temper; for, said he, there's neither Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Father, nor Honour to repair: and where his Pocket and Liberty are safe, he is contented to venture his Body and Soul.</p>

                     <p>Well — Men use us very barbarously: They will neither suffer us to be honest, nor allow us to be thought so — Here take this Key, and secure every thing that concerns my Reputation: and if my Husband wakes e're I come back, you may easily find some excuse to prevent his Enquiries; for the Carnival allows us more Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, than at other times we dare pretend to — I know thy honesty; and will rely upon't.</p>
