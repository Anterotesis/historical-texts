            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>THe wages of ſin is death,</hi> and the way to Live long is to live holy; a ſad but true Example we have here before our eyes. At <hi>Horſely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down</hi> lately lived one <hi>Froſt,</hi> by Trade a Broker, who having raiſed his fortune very much in a little time, not honeſtly, but ſinfully: his Conſcience being like the reſt of the Trade, as large as the Kings High-way, made it his buſineſs to gull and cheat all that came neer him or had any thing to do with him: inſtances of his helliſh practiſes might be here recited, but I ſhall give you but a few which are as followeth.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I am informed that he hath been the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of undoing many poor Families which have been driven to ſtraights for want of ſale for their goods, and having great families to maintain were forſt either to borrow money for a Week, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a Week three ſhillings in the pound, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it, and if they brought it not at the very Day he would arreſt them, or demand unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably, for their breach of promiſe, and by his threats get five or ten ſhillings out of theſe poor ſouls, that had more need have had ſo much given to them, and if they left any thing upon pawn, he did in like manner, retaining their goods for leſs then a quarter the worth of them, becauſe they had not money to fetch them on the very Day they promiſed: and further, he would when any dyed that uſeth to deal with him, though they owed him never a Farthing, to wright down ſo much delivered to ſuch a man, and would make the poor widdows pay it, many poor Fatherleſs
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106543:3"/>
children are bound to curſe him: he would make falſe bands fifty pound deep, when perſons have been dead, though they owed him nothing.</p>
            <p>But I proceed to his takening, the manner was as followeth.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Froſt</hi> was one that frequented one Mr. <hi>A.</hi> Bovvling-green at <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>driff</hi> four or five Days in a VVeek, and there he was obſerved by a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that uſed the green, to bett very much, and was often a changing of money, and it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that he put the money that he changed or won in one pocket, and that which was clipt he took out of the other pocket: ſometimes he was obſerved to put away forty ſhillings at a time, this being his practice for a conſiderable time: ſeveral of the Gentlemen that had won money of him, and changed money with him obſerved that always they had ſuch money of him, ſpoke to Mr. <hi>A.</hi> about it, and told him of ſuch a Man they had ſo much clipt money that they were afraid to put it off for fear they ſhould be apprehended for clipping of it; vvhereupon this Mr. <hi>A.</hi> Mr. of the Bovvling-green, acquaints one Mr. <hi>D.</hi> at the Tovver, and Mr. <hi>D.</hi> gave Mr. <hi>A.</hi> a guiny to change with Mr. <hi>Froſt,</hi> vvho accordingly did the next time <hi>Froſt</hi> came to the green, vvho gave him Eighteen ſhillings and ſixpence in clipt Half-crowns of old King <hi>Charles</hi> coyn: <hi>D.</hi> having received this clipt money quickly takes a guard and goes to ſeek for to apprehend <hi>Froſt,</hi> being come neer <hi>Horſly-Down,</hi> gets one <hi>S.

avvay they go to <hi>Froſts</hi> houſe, and knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Door, comes <hi>William Griffin</hi> his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant vvho vvas hired for a year, they demand en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and charged him vvith treaſon, he flyes in a doors and ſhuts them out, they get a fledge and break open the Door, vvhere they found one B. a Butcher, which was formerly accuſed for the ſame fact, ſtanding Juſt within the door with a drawn ſword in his hand, he made an attempt at the firſt, but there being a ſtrong guard ſoon ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, and preſently came Mr. <hi>Froſt,</hi> running out of his garden in his ſhirt; as he was comming in a doors their drapt a ſhilling out of his Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, this they found to be clipt: now they march up ſtairs, where they ſee many things that were ſuſpicious; Mr. D. demands the Key of the Cloſet, he ſaid it was below, he would go fetch it, but I will go with you ſays <hi>D.</hi> no ſooner were they come down, but they found 8 pound of old King <hi>Charles</hi> coyn, with the Keys, and looking under the table they find a great Drawer for to hold a great pair of Sheers, and alſo ſome clippings, and looking into the Cloſet, there they found waits, ſmoothing ſtones, and ſeveral other things tending to the ſame purpoſe, and ſome of the filings and clippings vvas melted down, and ſome unmelted; now they have good grounds to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him, ſo they take him and carry him before a Juſtice, and upon the examination of the witneſs, Mr. <hi>D.</hi> atteſted theſe things; and one Mr. <hi>VV.</hi> that is now a the Priſoner at Marſhalſes, &amp; a bill found againſt him laſt aſſizes, ordered by Mr. <hi>Froſt,</hi> or ſome of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, purpoſely to take off him from being a witneſs

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106543:4"/>
not to be concerned at all, till the Judges came whoſe Names were as followeth.</p>

            </list>
            <p>The Iudges being come, as great a throng of people as could have been, had it been an Aſsize for the whole Circuit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Froſt</hi> was immediately brought forth, who no ſooner perceived the Iudges, but his Brazon-face begins to gather paleneſs, and his hands and all his body ſhake, he that before ſeemed not to fear death, now is ready to dye for fear.</p>
            <p>When the Sentance was paſt upon him, he ſaid he muſt ſubmit to the Iudgement of the Iury.</p>
            <p>He did not ſeem penitent at all, and little hopes there can be that he will; he that hath been ſo wicked in all his practices all his life; but God is all-ſufficient, to whom, let us all like Chriſtians, put up our prayers for him, who as yet cannot pray for himſelf; let us be earneſt with God for his poor ſoul, that ſoul and body may not both Dye together.</p>
            <p>With <hi>Froſt</hi> was try'd his Man, by name <hi>VVilliam</hi>

               <hi>Griffin,</hi> his Indictment being for Clipping, upon his Examination, he was found not Guilty, and ſo Cleared.</p>
            <p>Now let this be a warning to all Brokers, how they grind the face of the poor, for you may ſee, that ſin brings ſhame. The ill effects of ſin appears in <hi>Froſt,</hi> who got an eſtate, but not honeſtly, and it thrived with him according; he was not contented with his unreaſonable gains in his trade, but like a Rabel to the King, as well as to his Maker, Clipps, and Filles his Majeſties Coyn, and liv'd to ſuck the ſweetneſs of this ſin, 'tis thought ſome years, but God would not ſuffer him to rain in his ſin any longer, and now he may ſee if ſin be not an unprofitable thing. If he had lived honeſtly he might have lived many years, but his wicked practices hath now brought him to open ſhame, and to juſt Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Death; and let us leave him vvhere ſin hath brought him, to prepare for his journey to the other World, his time being very ſhort in this; On Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday next 'tis Reported he vvill be executed at <hi>Kennington</hi> gallows, where he will not want Eyes to behold him, and I pray God they may not want hearts to pray for him: may his ſad end be a warning to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and it will be the joy of his heart, who wiſheth nothing more then that you would be careful to fear God, and honour the King, and then you may expect a bleſſing and to fill up the number of your days.</p>
