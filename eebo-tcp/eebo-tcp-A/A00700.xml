            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Am to requeſt (gentle Reader) one fauour at thy hande, that if this worke of the iudgement of Natiuities ſeeme harſh and vnpleaſant to thee, thou wouldeſt not therefore wound the ſame with iniurious words, to charge thy ſelfe with more follie then needes: but if thou finde it aboue thy knowledge or capacitie, ſaie as honeſt minded <hi>Chion</hi> ſaid: <hi>Let my betters iudge of theſe matters.</hi> For I muſt and do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that it is not a Booke for euerie mans reading, and hee that reades with deriſion, becauſe he vnderſtands not, muſt blame his owne inſufficiencie, and not the booke: for if hee could learne as much in an hower, as coſt a learned man many yeeres to compaſſe, then would his humor be pleaſed, and the worke not reproched. But let ſuch loyterers vnderſtand, that knowledge requires the whole circuit of a mans life, and liue he neuer ſo long, yet may he learne: but if it might be attained in a Sommers daie, a number would be excellent, that through default thereof remaineth vtterly ignorant.</p>
            <p>To vſe many words, I account needleſſe, knowing that the reproofe of the vnlearned, is rather the badge of their owne weake braine, then any blemiſh to a worke of worth: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let them cenſure as they pleaſe, the learned (I know) will iudge like themſelues, of whom I had rather be deſeruedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled, then by the other be ignorantly commended.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OR to iudge of Aſcendants and Natiuities, after the traditions of the auncient and learned Aſtrologians, it is conuenient firſt to explaine the Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all figure, and in the ſame, to applie the ſeauen Planets, with the head and tayle of the Dragon <hi>Lunaire,</hi> together with the part of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and the part of the ſpirite and others, more apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the high &amp; notable ſignifications of the ſtarres; Then, to ſette downe plainly the Celeſtiall figure, you muſt in the firſt place, note the yere, the day, &amp; the houre, with the moſt neereſt minute of time of the natiuitie that you haue vndertaken. The number of the howers and mynutes, you muſt ſette them downe after the manner of the numbring of the Aſtrologians, within theyr tables: alwaies ſette downe the hower's after-noone, as well by day as by night, and neuer ſay, one hower, two howers, three howers after midnight, but number xiij. hovvers, xiiij. howers, xv. after noone. This done, ſearch in the Ephemerides in the table of the yeere of your natiuitie, in the right month &amp; day propoſed, the degree of the ſigne
<pb facs="tcp:2200:6"/>
wherein the Sunne is: looke afterwarde in the Table of houſes, which ſerue for the latitude of your Country, and ſearch there the ſaid degree of the Sunne vnder the lyne of the tenth houſe. And hauing founde in the ſame place the ſame degree of the Sunne, you ſhall find directly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the left hand of the ſame Table, a number of howers and minutes, the which write apart. To which number, you muſt adde the howers and mynutes that hath beene giuen you of the ſame natiuity, and that which reſteth by your addition, you muſt ſeeke in the table of houſes: and there where you find the ſame number of howers &amp; my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes comming of the ſame addition, you muſt take to a right lyne the poynts and beginnings of the ſixe houſes, which you ſhall finde marked: the which you ſhall direct vpon your figure, beginning at the poynt of the tenth, and continuing towards the left hand.</p>
               <p>The beginning of the other ſixe houſes, you muſt take the oppoſite ſignes; and if it happen that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of houſes and mynutes, come to more then twentie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foure howers, it is then conuenient to ſubſtract twentie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foure howers of the ſame tyme, and the reſidue ſeeke out as we haue aforeſaid. If the hower of the ſame natiuitie, be vpon the poynt of twelue howers of noone, you muſt take the houſes in a right line of the degree of the ſunne, in the table of your latitude, without making any other addition, or ſubſtraction, and that when in the figure eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue: within the which, it is needfull by all meanes to apply the moouing of the Moone exactly calculated, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the vulgare cannons of the Ephemerides, for to verifie afterwarde your natiuitie by the hower of the conception.

               <p>LEauing the Animodar of <hi>Ptolome</hi> and the meetings of <hi>Schoner,</hi> and all other vncertaine waies (although they haue theyr Authors) to verifie the howers of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:2200:6"/>
natiuities, I will preſently follow the method of <hi>Hermes,</hi> approoued by long experience, and confirmed by <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me</hi> in his Centiloque, and by <hi>Abraham Aueneſrus,</hi> by <hi>Alphonce Leopolde, Haly,</hi> and other moſt expert Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logians. <hi>Hermes</hi> ſaith, that the aſcendant of a natiuitie, hath beene the place of the Moone at the tyme of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; and that the aſcendant of the conception, is the place of the Moone at the hower of the natiuitie. Who would be moore neere certified of the hower &amp; mynute of a natiuitie, and of the true aſcendant, it is conuenient that you follow the doctrine of <hi>Hermes</hi> by the method fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. Firſt of all that you looke into the figure eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, whether the Moone be aboue the Horrizon or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath. If ſhe be aboue the Horrizon, count the diſtance that is betweene the poynt of the ſeauenth houſe and the Moone: if ſhe be beneath the Horrizon, count the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which is from the firſt houſe vnto the Moone, which diſtance of ſignes and degrees, you muſt ſearch in the table that followeth, vnder the title of the Moone, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Horrizon or beneath, as truely you haue found in the ſaid figure. In a right lyne of the ſaid diſtance, you ſhall find the time that the infant hath remained within the wombe of his Mother, in a certaine number of dayes, the which you muſt reckon from the day of your natiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie backward; and there where the number endeth, you muſt marke the day of the conception, if the Moone be found in the ſigne of the aſcendant eſtimatiue. If you find her not in the ſame place, goe backwarde or forward cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine dayes of your account, vntill you haue founde the Moone within the ſaid ſigne, not farre from the degree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant in the ſaid figure. The day conſidered, and in what hower, goe forwarde to the Eaſt poynt, the place where you haue ſounde the Moone in the figure eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and at that hower you muſt calculate the moouing of the Moone. For this degree and mynute in the which you found her, you muſt place it in the aſcendant of your natiuitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:2200:7"/>
And to know the hower in the which the place of the Moone of the natiuity, roſe to the Eaſt poynt at the time of the conception, take firſt the ouerthwart aſcention of the ſaid place of the Moone, within the table of the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of your country, in the booke of <hi>Iohn de Regiomonte,</hi> of the ſame aſcention take away 90. degrees, (&amp; ad to the whole circle which is of 360. degrees, when the ſubſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be otherwiſe made) the reſidue ſhall be the right aſcention of the height of the poynt of the Mery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian circle: take afterward the right aſcention of the Sun, and take out by the ſubſtraction of the right aſcention of the ſayd poynt of the Merydian, and adde 360. degrees if it be neceſſary, &amp; turne that which is left into howers and minutes, in gyuing to 30. degrees two howers, to fifteene degrees one hower, to one degree 4. minutes of an houre, to fifteene minutes one minute of an hower; by thys meanes you ſhall exactly come to the hower of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, to the which you muſt calculate the place of the Moone, and the ſame well calculated, put it to the poynt of the firſt houſe, in the figure of the natiuitie.</p>
               <p>Diuers for this verefication doe dreſſe and garniſh the motions of the Planets foure figures. One of that hower eſtimatiue of the natiuitie, the other, of the precedent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction or oppoſition of the brightnes: the third, of the verification by the Animodar: the fourth, of the concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The which beſides the vnprofitable and ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous labour, erre greatly, thinking to find out the tyme of the conception by the Animodar of <hi>Ptolome,</hi> the which experience from day to day ſheweth to be falſe, and that it hath no auncient Author to maintaine it, or hath made mention of thys newe doctrine, being full of contention and diſproued veritie.</p>

               <p>THe giuer of life is taken out of the principal places of the Figure (that is to ſay) of the Sunne, of the Moone, and of the Aſcendant, of the part of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, &amp; of the degree of the laſt coniunction or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of lights; the which hauing wel noted, we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider firſt, if the natiuitie be diurnal or nocturnal? For if ſhe be diurne wee beginne at the Sunne, the which within the firſt, tenth, or eleuenth houſe, in a maſculine or femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine ſigne, ſhall be fitte to giue life, if it haue any giuer
<pb facs="tcp:2200:14"/>
of tyme that doth regard it: If it be in the nynth, eygth, or ſeuenth houſe, it may alſo be the giuer of life, if it be in a Maſculine ſigne, and not in a Feminine: in other places it cannot be the giuer of life, but by conſtraint. It is alwaies neceſſarie for ſuch an acte, that the giuer of time regard the giuer of life, otherwiſe, the ſayd giuer of life ſhall be as perſon that hath good will to doo his friend good &amp; hath not wherewithall; And ſo when the Sunne ſhall be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aſpect of any giuer of time, you muſt leaue it there, &amp; goe to the Moone, which may giue the life within the firſt houſe, in the ſigne Maſculine or Feminine, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the tenth, eleuenth, ſeuenth, fourth, fifth, ſecond and third houſe, in ſignes Feminines and not Maſculines, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing aſpect of any giuer of time. If the Moone haue not all the ſayde conditions, you muſt come to the degree aſcendant, if the natiuitie be coniunctionall (Coniunctio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall is ſayed the natiuitie, before the which laſtly the lights haue beene conioyned) and if the ſayde degree re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue aſpect of his gyuer of time, he ſhall be gyuer of life: otherwiſe not.

When ſhe is preuentionall, (Preuentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall is ſayed, afore the which laſtly the lights haue beene oppoſites) after you haue conſidered the Sunne and the Moone, you muſt conſequentlie contemplate the place of Fortune, more than the degree aſcendant, and laſtly the degree of the oppoſitions of the lights, &amp; ſee that it haue 2. degrees in the oppoſition, one of them of the Sunne, and

               <head>CHAP. IX. Of the giuer of yeeres, called of the Arabians <hi>Alcocoden.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE gyuer of time or giuer of yeeres, is the ſame that hath dignitie of houſe, exaltation, triplicitie, or tearme in the place where is the giuer of life. As if the Sunne were in the xj. in the ſigne of Sagitarius, (there where he may be gyuer of life,) and Iupiter were in the ſigne of Aquarius, he ſhall regarde the Sunne of the Sextile aſpect, and looke that he haue dignitie of the houſe in the ſigne of the Sunne, he ſhalbe giuer of yeeres. It is then neceſſary, that theſe two thinges concurre toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the end that one Plannet be giuer of yeeres, that is to ſay, that he hath dignitie neuertheles of tearme (for the dignitie of face is not ſufficient enough for one ſo great effect) in ſigne and degree, in the which ſhall be the giuer of life, and that he regarde the ſayd giuer of life, of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect or other.</p>
               <p>This gyuer of time, well lodged vpon the point of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, gyueth him olde yeeres, in points of the houſes ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding: is meanes, is Cadants, is ſmalneſſe, and for as much as he ſhall be long from the beginnings of the ſaid houſes, ſo much the more or leſſe hee muſt diminiſh the number of his olde yeeres, meanes, and ſmalnes, after
<pb facs="tcp:2200:15"/>
the difference taken of the next houſes with the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of yeeres. And firſt of all if it be within any angle of heauen, not alwayes to the firſt poynt, you muſt proceede alſo, and take in the firſt place the diſtance of the ſayd an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, and of the next houſe ſucceeding. Note afterwarde, how many degrees the ſaid giuer of yeeres is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the point of the angle. Then take the difference of his olde yeeres and meanes, multiply this difference by the number of the ſayd elongment, and part it by the diſtance of the ſayd angle, &amp; of the houſe ſucceeding: that which reſteth, take for the exact number of the yeres of life, promiſed by the ſaide giuer of yeeres. If hee be within any houſe, ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out of the points and beginnings of the ſame, you muſt firſt take the diſtance of the houſe ſucceeding, and of the next Cadant: then note how many degrees the ſaid giuer of yeeres ſhall be elonged from the point of the ſaid houſe ſucceeding; afterward take the difference of yeres, meanes and ſmalnes, the which multiply by the ſecond number, and part it by the firſt: the reſidue ſhall be the time of life which was promiſed by the ſaid giuer of yeres. If it bee in Cadant houſes it ſhall be vppon the points of them, or after, he giueth but onely ſmall yeeres: Except when he is within 5. degrees neere to the point of the ſaid angles, &amp; then you muſt reckon as it followeth. Take the difference of the olde yeeres, and ſmalnes of the Plannets that giueth the yeres, and deuide them into 5. parts; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward looke in which of the ſaid 5. degrees ſhal be the ſaid Plannet. For if it be in the firſt and moſt neere the poynt of the angle, (that is to ſay) if he be elonged from the ſaid angle one degree onely, then is it conuenient to take out of his old yeeres, one of the ſayd 5. parts: if he be elonged by 2. degrees, you muſt take out 2. parts: if he be elonged 3. degrees, you muſt ſubſtract 3. parts, &amp;c. You muſt note that the Moone in the viij. giues but ſmall yeeres. And that the Sunne within the 9. and Iupiter in the 11. and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus in the 5. and Mercury by the whole aſcendant, and the Moone in the 3. giue their olde yeeres as perfectly, as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2200:15"/>
if they were vpon the points of the angles: For they be places wherein principally they doo reioyce. Iupiter, Venus, and Mercury within the 9. giue theyr yeeres in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different: and the Moone in the 11. giues them old. Mars in the 6. and Saturne in the 12. they are indifferent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the ſaide places they greatly delight themſelues: wherefore if they were not euill, they woulde there giue olde yeeres.</p>
               <p>Vppon this propoſe it is conuenient alſo to note, that one burnt Plannet cannot bee a giuer of yeeres: and the Moone in the prime of the beames of the Sunne, cannot giue life nor time. If a Plannet, which otherwiſe may be a giuer yeeres, bee burnt in his proper houſe or exaltation, receiuing there the Sunne, cauſeth the Sunne to take the charge to be the giuer of yeeres. If it come to paſſe that the Sunne or the Moone be in their proper houſes or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altations, they may be giuers of life &amp; time together, with out neede to deſire aſpect of any other Plannet. If one place being ſignificator of life, haue many giuers of yeres, wee will take him that hath moſt dignities in the ſame place, and if they be equall in dignities wee will take hym that hath his aſpect moſt whole, and his beames moſt neereſt the ſayd giuer of life. If they finde two or three or many giuers of life, that haue their giuers of yeres, they muſt alwayes conſider and direct, as the firſt and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, following the yeeres of the Plannets.</p>

               <p>THey which augment the number of the ſayd yeres, are Iupiter, Venus, the Sunne, the Moone, &amp; Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie fortified; the which fortunatly regarding the gyuer of yeeres, with an amiable aſpect adding to their ſmall yeeres, (that is to vnderſtand) the Sunne x. and ix. Venus viij. the Moone xxv. &amp;c. Likewiſe If the gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of time be conioyned with any fixed ſtarre of amiable nature, it taketh of the ſaid ſtarre the number of the ſmall yeeres of the Plannet, of the which the ſaid ſtarre holdeth his nature. If the ſaid Plannets regard the giuer of time with an euill aſpect with reception, they adde as before, which they doo not when they haue no reception: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Iupiter and Venus, that in euery ſort of aſpects, with reception or without reception, alwayes adding to theyr ſmall yeeres, for to ſee that the gyuer of tyme be not Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne or Mars, towards the which the reception is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, if the aſpect be of enmitie.</p>
               <p>The ſayd Plannets euill placed and infortunate, in the place of the whole ſmall yeeres, in adding the halfe, or the third, or fourth part, or certaine number of monethes, of weekes, or of dayes, according to the greatneſſe or ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of theyr infelicitie. The amiable aſpects of ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, with reception, giue theyr yeeres ſmall: without reception, they doo neither good nor euill. If the giuer of yeeres be retrogarde or meridionall deſcending, or in hys fall or detryment, or in the way burned, that taketh from it the fift part of that which hee had giuen beeing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſpoſed. That which happened alſo to the 3. ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Planets, when they be occidentall, &amp; to the Moone when ſhe decreaſeth, and when ſhee is in the xx. and ix. degree of a ſigne, and when ſhe is ſlack in her courſe.

               <p>YOu muſt take the Lord of the Natiuitie, out of the places of the which we haue taken the giuer of life, (that is to vnderſtand) of the place of the Sunne and of the Moone, of the degree aſcendant of the part of Fortune, and of the degrees of the precedent coniunction or oppoſition of lightes. Of all theſe places likewiſe it is to be conſidered, what Plannet hath moſt dignities, for he ſhall be Lord of the Natiuitie, that which the giuer of yeeres ſhall ſignifie the tyme of our life, according to the ſcituation &amp; felicitie or infelicitie, as we haue before ſayd of the giuer of yeeres. And if the one giue more than the other, you muſt take the difference of both, and the halfe ad or diminiſh: according as ſhall be neceſſarie.</p>

               <p>HOW to knowe the felicitie or infelicitie of the Spirite, &amp; the nature of the ſame, you muſt looke in the place of Mercurie and of the Moone, the Planet that in theſe two places hath moſt digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſhall be ſignifier of the ſpirite. The which if it be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne well diſpoſed, ſhall ſignifie the man of a great and profound knowledge, of good counſell, and of good gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie or a ſtrong opinion: cloſe, ſecrete, ſolitarie, diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling his good and euill, a louer of iuſt men, and of good age: reioycing vpon the treaſures, heritages and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings; holding diſcourſe of antiquities and of great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres, admirator of buildings. Sometimes a little merrie, incontinent ſadde: ſometymes laughing or murmuring by himſelfe alone, a lyttle ſlothfull, a little enuious, and not alwaies keeping hys promiſe. If he be vnfortunate, he ſhall be noted enuious, ſadde, ſolitarie, fearefull, mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie, faint-harted, a raylor, iealous, a malefactor, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, a blaſphemer, a lyer &amp; deceiuer, a Vſurer, &amp; holder of opinions: reiecting the counſell of others: fearing that all the world doth deceiue hym: vnciuill, a villaine, a ſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, diſhoneſt, flying the company of men vnleſſe it be to deceiue them, and to draw any profite, hauing no other friend but his villainous gayne, vſing ſomtimes ſorcery.</p>
               <p>Iupiter ſignifier of the ſpirite, well diſpoſed, ſhewes the man ſweete, curteous, honeſt, gracious, amiable, faithfull, pittifull, liberall, of good behauior, of good hart &amp; good loue: following nobleneſſe and all honeſty: louing God, abounding in friendes, dreaming alwaies vpon ſome ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous thing, and withdrawes himſelfe ſometimes ſolitary, to thinke vpon ſome goodnes: vſing in all and by all hys affayres, a great equitie, prudence and modeſtie, hauing great courage to accompliſh. If hee be vnfortunate of himſelfe, and not to meete with other ſtarres, in the place
<pb facs="tcp:2200:18"/>
of good loue, hee will giue ſometimes fooliſhnes in the place of honeſty, pryde in the place of liberalitie, prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galitie in the place of louing good will, doth yeeld hym an hypocrite, ſeeming to follow nobleneſſe, when indeed he will diſpraiſe all the world: in the place of honeſtie, it wyll make hym dreame of tyranny.</p>
               <p>If the ſaid Iupiter be vnfortunate of other Planets and not of hymſelfe, he taketh all theyr vices, and couereth them with his ſayde vertues in manner of an euill hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite. If Mars well fortunate be the ſaid ſignificator, hee ſhall cauſe the man to be of a high courage, hardy, irefull, furious, a hazarder, a conducter of warres, &amp; the firſt in buſineſſe, and onely in deedes and cogitations gyuen to armes: ſtrong, ſtubberne and mightie, truſting too much to his owne puiſſaunce, not fearing any perrill, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in all hys deedes. If he be vnfortunate, it maketh the man tymerous, a theefe, a lyer, blaſphemer, mutenous, cruell, a murtherer, hardy, proude, arrogant, not to be borne withall, deſpyſing hys owne proper goods, and the goods of other, vſing force and violence againſt hys Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and againſt all the worlde: a diuiliſh man, without ſhame, without counſell, without vertue, without loue, without any feare or reuerence of God, furious, ſeditious, gyuen and prompt to all miſchiefe.</p>
               <p>If the Sunne be ſignificator in his good diſpoſition, it makes the man mannerly, wiſe, prudent, of good counſell, a louer of noblenes, following glory and honour, gyuen to iuſtice and gouernments of Townes and Citties, louing hunting, worthy, and of great eſtimation.

               <p>If Venus ſignifie the qualitie of the ſpirite in good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, it maketh the man pleaſant, merry, dauncing, laughing, content, amiable, gracious, of good conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a little ielous.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2200:18"/>
that which belongeth not vnto him.</p>
               <p>If Mercurie bee fortunate, it gyues good vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, good memorie, great perſeuerance, great ſubtiltie of ſpyrite, good diſcourſe of reaſon, full of wit, very apt to know the Mathematicals, and the ſecretes of nature; it makes the man a Poet, an Orator, well ſpoken, writing well, and a great trader. If it be euill diſpoſed, it makes him preſumpteous, of little knowledge, with great eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his perſon, inconſtant, a lyer, a mocker, a decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ordinarily, fine, fantaſticall, and vicious.</p>
               <p>If it be the Moone that is fortunate, ſhee maketh him that is borne, pacified, modeſt, of good hart, or good will, and eaſie to endure any thing that one will doe. Vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate doth ſhew inconſtancie, lightnes of ſpyrite, faint-har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, prodigall, faythleſſe. If the ſayde ſignifiers, are not greatly fortunate or vnfortunate, it is conuenient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the ſayde ſignifications good and vicious, after the qualitie of theyr good and euill diſpoſitions.</p>
               <p>If any Planet be participant in the ſignification of the manners, or if it haue great communication of aſpect with the principall ſignificator, then conſidering the vices and vertues of him, that (according to his good or euill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition) wee doe ioyne them to him which gyueth the principall. As if Saturne well diſpoſed, be principal ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificator, and Mars infortunate be participant, or regarde Saturne of one whole aſpect with reception, then it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient to mingle ſome little of the nature of Mars vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, with the ſignifications of Saturue fortunate.</p>
               <p>The Aſtrologians doe aduertiſe vs, that if the Lord of the aſcendant be well placed, and the ſaide ſignificator of manners euill diſpoſed, you muſt more conſider vppon that which the Lord of the aſcendant ſignifieth, then vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that which the ſaid ſignificator doth promiſe. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, they conſider more particulerly, the place of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie and of the Moone, and the aſpect which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue. If Mercurie be in the aſcendant, it maketh the Man ingenious, and of great and profounde knowledge,
<pb facs="tcp:2200:19"/>
a great Phyloſopher, a Mathematician, an Orator, a Poet, a Diuine; principally whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is in the place in the which Saturne hath at the leaſt 4. dignities, or when he receiues aſpect of Saturne.</p>
               <p>Mercury in the twelfth, receiuing aſpect of the Moone, hath very neere as great force for to giue wit and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as if he were in the firſt. And where that Mercurie is, if he regard the Moone, and both two, or the one or the other, regard the aſcendant or the Lord of the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, thys is ſigne of a good and ſubtile ſpyrite. And if Saturne, Iupiter and Mars, or other Planets, do commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to him theyr fauorable beames, if they mingle theyr good vertues, if they regarde the euill aſpect, they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingle theyr vices: except Iupiter and Venus, which of euill aſpect doe neuer anoy them, and leſſe when he hath reception.</p>
               <p>If the Sunne be temporall light, it may ſignifie the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the ſpyrite with the Moone and Mercurie in the forme aboue ſayd. If Mercurie be occidentall within the houſe or exaltation of the Sunne, hauing aſpect of the Moone, or of the aſcendant, or of his Lord, it is the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne ſigne of good and high ſpirits, of men of al know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, gyuen to great enterpriſes and vertues, as Poets, Orators, Mathematicians, Counſellers, Adminiſtrators of Common-weales, and Gouernours of Realmes: prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally when hee is fortunate in euery angle of Heauen.</p>
               <p>Mercurie within the ſeauenth houſe fortunate, giueth good vnderſtanding, and ripe iudgement: it maketh the man ſubtile, watchfull, and of good counſell, with great craft to gouerne his affayres. Mercurie in the ninth or third houſe, giueth knowledge and contemplation. The part of the vnderſtanding of the ſpyrite with theyr Lords fortunate, ſignifieth good ſpirits and good manners.</p>
               <p>Mercurie in the ſigne of Piſces, doth not any way loue learning: the contrary happeneth, when he is in the ſigne of Virgo and of Gemini, by all the places of the figure of Heauen. Saturne within the houſes of Mercurie, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies

               <p>When the lyghts and ſignificators of manners ſhall be oppreſſed with ill fortune, the chylde ſhall be of a verie ſtrange and peruerſe nature. The Moone oppoſite to the Sunne, makes hym hate all men. If the Sunne and the Moone with the aſcendant and his Lorde, be all in femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine ſignes, the manners of hym ſhall be feminine, and he ſhal be a man of little hart. If they be in ſignes maſculine at the natiuitie of a woman, her deedes ſhal be manly, and ſhe ſhall be a woman of great enterpriſe.</p>
               <p>If Venus be in the ſigne of the Lyon, or vnder the beames of the Sunne, or in coniunction or other aſpect of Mars, ſhe maketh that the man ſhal be ſuddainly ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in loue. And if in that eſtate ſhee be within the firſt or tenth houſe, without any aſpect of Iupiter, hee ſhall be voluptuous without hauing ſhame; and when ſhe ſhalbe in the ſigne of Scorpio, the aſpect of Iupiter towards Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, gyueth alwaies chaſtitie, and loue of vertue.</p>

               <p>FOR the riches and pouertie, it is conuenient firſt that you looke to the ſeconde houſe, for if ſhee and her Lord be fortunate, we ſay that the chyld ſhall be rich, and if they be vnfortunate, he ſhall be poore on that ſide. Then afterward you muſt conſider the part of Fortune, the which with hys Lorde well diſpoſed, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth great ſtore of goods, without other witnes. If they be euill diſpoſed, you muſt come to the parte of goods the which with his Lord fortunate enricheth, vnfortunate gyueth nothing.

ſignificator of riches, which is Iupiter, the which well placed and fortunate, gyueth goods in aboundance: principally if he be Lord of the natiuity, or Lorde of the hower, or of the aſcendant, or of the ſeconde houſe, or of the part of Fortune, or of the part of goods, or of the part of felicitie, or of temporall light, or of the tenth houſe, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe he gyueth nothing.</p>
               <p>When the aboue-ſayde Significators ſhall be vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, the chylde cannot be rich, if the tenth houſe (of the which wee will ſpeake heereafter) doe not promiſe hym ſome good lucke. Men finde alſo often by experience, that when a Planet is within his own houſe or exaltation, or in hys ioy, (without beeing vnfortunate, or els where enuironed with the fortunes or theyr beames) that hee gyueth goods, although he be not Significator of riches. If in the fourth houſe be hys lord or other fortunate Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, he promiſeth inheritaunces. If any fixed ſtarre of the firſt or ſecond greatnes be ioyned to the temporall lyght, or to the degree aſcendant, or to the poynts of the other angles, or to other Planets in the ſayd places placed, ſhe dooth rayſe the man of baſe eſtate, to great authority and honour: and if he be of the race of Princes, it will make hym a puiſſant Lord and King.</p>
               <p>When a lyke Planet ſhall be Lord of the aſcendant, &amp; of the ſecond houſe, the chylde ſhall be couetous of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney &amp; gayne, as that which happeneth when Capricorne is aſcendant.

               <p>HAuing well noted the places which promiſe and bring riches, in regarding the ſituation of the ſaid ſignificators, we wyll know by what means ought to come the good and the euill. For if the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator be in the firſt houſe receiued and fortunate, it eaſily inricheth the perſon by hys induſtry and proper labour: and if he be in the ſayd place vnfortunate, it is that his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and labour doth profit hym nothing; and the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from thence to loſſe and damage.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:2200:21"/>
If he be in the ſecond houſe well diſpoſed, it profiteth to talke with Merchants, and lend merchandize &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and of them make gaine. And if he be there euil di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed, the ſayd buſines bringeth great damages. If he be within the thirde houſe fortunate, it bringeth the goods from the ſide of Brothers and Siſters, and Coſins &amp; alyes, or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſide of the men of the Church in taking charge of theyr affayres: or to traffique heere and there about his Country. If he be in the 4. wel placed, he is inriched of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances &amp; goods of our fathers &amp; predeceſſors, of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borings &amp; tilling of ground, of houſes, &amp; oftentimes doth meete with treaſure. If it be within the fift, it profits to be a good Dauncer, a good Player, to bee braue, gracious, pleaſant and delightfull, and ſometimes to be voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: alwayes well, becauſe of God-fathers and God-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and of theyr proper chyldren; or becauſe of gyfts, or to make ſome voyage and doe ſome embaſſage. Thoſe things that come appertaining to brauery and volupte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and making ready delicates, odours &amp; perfumes, of thys houſe they very ſuddainly draw theyr profite. If the ſayd ſignificator be in the ſixt well placed, hee ſhall make his profite in nouriſhing, and buying and ſelling of Sheepe, muttons, and other ſmall beaſtes, or ſhall become rich by the diligence and faithfulneſſe of his ſeruaunts, or ſhall gaine by the exerciſe of Phiſicke. The Gaylors and others which haue the charge of pryſons, drawe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times theyr profit from thys houſe.</p>
               <p>If the ſignificator be in the ſeauenth fortunate, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth great good of the ſide of women, by marriages or like agreements: and oftentimes to haue pleaded &amp; gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his ſute in the law, or hauing beene in the warres and pilled the enemies. If it be in the eyght well diſpoſed, it gyueth great dowrie and great good, becauſe of women, and ſometimes heritages, of the which he ſhall not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie thinke of.

If it be well in the tenth, he ſhall haue his profit of the ſide of Kings, Princes, and Lordes, and be made of them Gouernours of Townes, and honourable Officers; or be enriched by their owne vocation and profeſſion.</p>

               <p>If it be in the twelueth, fortunate, it giueth gayne by nouriſhing and ſelling of Horſes, Mares, Oxen, Kyne, Cammells, and other great beaſtes: or to haue charge of pryſonners: or of the perſecution of enemies, with profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table victorie in the end; As oftentimes it happeneth to ſome, which accuſing others, and cannot prooue the crymes intended be condemned to make a good amendes to the partie: after all which perſecution, the partie doth finde himſelfe content.</p>
               <p>Saturne by himſelfe, enricheth by heritages &amp; labours, nouriſhing of all Cattell, and with trading with aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent men, or with Countrey-men, Marriners, &amp; other vilde men: in Corne, Wines, Oyles, Fyſh, Oade, Roſen, Allum, Leather, Tyles, Stones, Plaiſter, Chalke, Lyme, and ſuch merchandize.</p>

               <p>Mercury, to ſpeake well and write well, and to be very skilfull, to be a Secretarie, a Regiſter, a Poet, an Oratour,

               <p>If the Significator of goodes be Orientall, the goodes come in youth, if it be Occidentall, in age.

The part of the mother, ſignifieth as much of the mother, after her good or euill diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>Commonly the Aſtrologians haue regard to the Sunne and to Saturne for the Father, and to Venus and the Moone for the mother; If the natiuitie bee by day, they take the Sun for ſignificator of the father: if it by be night they take Saturne, if the Sunne be not in any angle of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: For if it be in the 1. or 4. they preferre him alwayes to Saturne. If the Sunne be in the 1. in the natiuitie of the 1. childe, the figure of the natiuitie of the Father and of the Sonne ſhall be both one. The ſignificator of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ioyned to the Fortunes, or receiuing their amiable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, denote good fortune and long life to the Father: the contrary you muſt vnderſtand when they be vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate.</p>
               <p>If the Lorde of the aſcendant, and the Lorde of the 4. doo looke with an euill aſpect; the Sonne and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall be in diſcorde, principally if Mars intermeddle with his pernicious beames. For the mother you muſt looke principally to Venus, if the natiuitie be by day: or to the Moone if it be by night; And after their good and euill diſpoſitions, you muſt iudge the good or contrary fortune of the mother.</p>

               <p>THE Fortunes, or other Plannets fortunate, within the fourth or eight houſe, denoteth inheritances and poſſeſſions: the ill fortunes doe deny or diſpiſe them. Saturne, naturall ſignificator of heritages, landes and poſſeſſions, well diſpoſed, dooth giue great goods and landes, and maketh the man happie in labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and tyllage; That alſo ſignifieth the ſignificators of ryches, when they bee well diſpoſed within the houſes of Saturne. And the part of heritages, and the part of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in ſowers &amp; tyllers whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be fortunate, with their Lords. If the ſayde ſignificator be vnfortunate, you muſt iudge the contrary.</p>
               <p>When one ſelfe Plannet is lorde of the firſt and fourth houſe, the childe ſhall haue inheritances which ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich him, if the ſayd lorde be fortunate: and if he ſell and diſpearſe them, he is vnfortunate. The lorde of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant, or the Moone within the fourth fortunate, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miably by Iupiter or Venus regarded, denote that he ſhal finde ſome great ſumme of money vnder the earth, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, if Saturne caſt his Trynes or Sextil beames: or that of Mines of golde and ſiluer he ſhall be made rich.</p>
               <p>The tayle of the Dragon in the ſouth, maketh him to ſell &amp; diſpearſe his goods. That doth alſo the head of the Dragon, when ſhe is in a ſigne earthly or watriſh: In ayrie ſignes or fiery, ſhe giueth great goods and landes.</p>

               <p>YOV muſt firſt of all conſider the places of Saturne and of Mars, and of the Lord of the ſixt houſe. And according to the ſigne in the which they bee, you muſt iudge the ſickneſſe to bee in the place mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by the ſayd ſigne. As if Saturne were in the ſigne of Libra, it denoteth that the ſicknes is in the reynes of the nature of Saturne: becauſe that Libra is the ſigne that hath gouernment ouer the reynes, as ſhall be declared in the ſeconde Booke. Likewiſe you muſt iudge of other Significators, after the gouernment of the ſigne in the which they be.</p>
               <p>The ſicknes and accidents comming by Saturne, Mars and other Planets, ſhalbe explaned in the ſecond booke. Mars in the aſcendant, gyueth alwaies ſome notable hurt vpon the face, or vpon the head, and often neere the eyes, when hee is neere the lights. Saturne in the firſt houſe, yeeldeth the man to be very ſadde, and melancholie, and vexeth the minde, cauſing horrible ill and fearefull ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations.
<pb facs="tcp:2200:26"/>
The tayle of the Dragon in the firſt, darkeneth much the ſight and often yeeldes the men blind, when the Luminaries or the fortunes, doe not intermingle their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable beames. Saturne and Mars in the tenth, ſignifie ſicknes in the necke, in the ſeauenth, in the buttockes: as Fiſtuloes, Emrods, Vlcers, and hurts &amp;c. In the ſixt, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes in the feete: in the twelfith, hurts and grieſes in the legges, as I haue often tryed. Saturne infortunate, ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth diſeaſes in the parts appertaining to Saturne. Iupiter and the other, ſignifie as much when they be euill diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Of the partes which belong to the Planets wee will ſpeake of in the ſecond Booke.</p>
               <p>They which haue the Lumynaries, or any of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall places in the figure vnfortunate in the figne of Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio, are ſubject to the French-pocks. The ill fortunes in the ſigne of Gemini, gyue alwaies ſome great and violent blowes vpon the ſhoulders, legges &amp; armes. The Moone vnfortunate in the ſigne of Aries, ſignifieth great paine in the head. Saturne and Mars ioyned to the Lumynaries, or to the Lord of the aſcendant, trouble the ſight, and ſpoyle the eyes with ſome blowe. The Sunne in the natiuities Diurnes, ſignifyeth the right eye, the Moone the left: in the Nocturnes, to the contrary. If the degrees of the firſt houſe, or the Lumynaries be ioyned with any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome ſtarre, the eyes ſhall be darke, and the ſight trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; lykewiſe if they be in the ſignes which the Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers call <hi>Azemena</hi> and filthy dregges. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Saturne in the ſixt houſe burned in a warry ſigne, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noteth ſome forme of leproſie. Saturne in the aſcendant, maketh ſome notable deformitie in the face, when hee is neere the Moone. The ill fortunes, and the Moone and Venus in warry ſignes, ſignifie leproſie, vlcers &amp; cankers on the body, and villainous ſpots in the face. Saturne in the ninth, and the Moone in the eyght vnfortunate, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note trouble of minde and ſolly. Venus ioyned to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie vnfortunate by Saturne or Mars, without aſpect of Iupiter or of the Sun, ſignifie notable griefe in the partes
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2200:26"/>
of generation. If Venus &amp; Mercury be vnder the beames of the Sunne, they ſignifie as much. Saturne wyth the Moone burned, cauſeth Palſies and Impoſtumes. Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie vnfortunate, gyueth alwaies ſome impediment in the tongue: and ſo doth Saturne alſo when he is vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the temporall lights. The Sunne vnfortunate, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noteth weakenes of the hart: principally when he is lord of the ſixt houſe, or Lord of the part of ſickneſles. The ill fortunes with the tayle of the Dragon, cauſe looſeneſſe and the flixe of the bellie. They that haue the Sunne or Mars in the ſignes of Aries or Gemini, be ſubiect to the Stone. The retrogradation and burning of Saturne and Iupiter, ſpoyle the hearing, and the teeth.</p>
               <p>When the Moone &amp; Mercury doe not looke between them, and doe not regard the aſcendant, nor the Lord of the aſcendant, the chylde ſhall be troubled in his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.

When he is a terreſtiall, or burned: when he is a fierie Signe: principally if the Lord of the aſcendant and the luminaries temporally be vnfortunate by Mars. If it be the Sunne well diſpoſed, hee ſhall die of ſome hote diſeaſe. If it be vnfortunate, by the commaundement of the Prince, or by ſentence of the Iudge, or hee ſhall dye among a great company of men, ſubiect to death, or in priſon, or in a Dungeon, or in ſome other ſtincking and filthy place. If it be Venus wel diſpoſed, he ſhal die of too much eating fruites, or with too much continuing his voluptuouſnes, or of ſome Fiſtula or Impoſtume. If ſhe be vnfortunate, it denoteth death by venim, principallie when ſhe is burned, or ioyned to Saturne, or of too much burning affection of loue, or of great griefes of the French pockes. If it be Mercurie fortunate, it maketh him dye by ſadneſſe, by great apprehenſions, by the Yellowe iaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, by pthiſickes, by the burning Feuer, or by too much watching. If he be greatly vnfortunate, it ſignifieth that he ſhall die by madneſſe, the Falling-ſicknes, by violent Coughes, with breaking in ſunder the veynes, by fooliſh mellancholie, by Ielouſie.</p>
               <p>If it be the Moone well diſpoſed, with too much eating moyſt meates, by drinking water, by too much continuing his pleaſure; If ſhe be vnfortunate, you muſt conſider the nature of him which is vnfortunate. For if it be Mars hee ſhall dye by fire, or by hurt: or by abortiſment if it be a woman. If it bee Saturne, by ruines, falles, peſtilences, and like accidents.</p>

Before concluding of what death the partie ſhall dye, you muſt conſider the diſpoſition of the Lorde of the aſcendant, and of the luminaries temporall: For if they be well diſpoſed, the death ſhal not be vyolent, although the principall ſignificator bee greatly vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. If the ſayd ſignificator be vnfortunate, together with the luminaries temporall, or the Lord of the aſcendant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill diſpoſed, we eſteeme certainly that the death ſhall be vyolent, if Iupiter or Venus doo not intermingle theyr fauourable beames, and then the ſayd perſon ſhall fall in great daunger of the ſaid violent death, &amp; from the which he ſhall alwayes eſcape myraculouſly.</p>
               <p>If one of the ill fortunes be in the ſigne of Cancer, and the other in the ſigne of the Lyon, the death ſhall be vyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; Likewiſe, if any of the ſayde ill fortunes be in the ſigne of the Lyon, and the luminaries temporall, or the Lord of the aſcendant be vnfortunate, and one of the ill fortunes be in the firſt houſe, and the other in the ſeuenth or fourth, or one of them in the tenth and the other in the fourth.</p>

Mars in the ninth or eyght in the ſigne of Aquarius or of Gemini, oppoſite to the Moone, or the Lorde of the aſcendant, without good aſpect of fortunes, maketh hym perriſh by Sulpher or fire from heauen. Saturne in the twelfth, ſixt, eyght, or fourth houſe vnfortunate, the lord of the ſayde houſes maketh hym dye in pryſon, or els where in great payne

               <p>THE Sunne returning to the ſame poynt in the which he was at the hower of the natiuity, maketh the reuolution euery yeere. He therfore that wold know the hower and mynute of the reuolution, he muſt looke in the Ephemerides, at what hower and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute the Sunne beganne to enter into the degree minute and ſecond, in which he was at the hower of the natiuity.</p>

               <p>FIrſt looke howe the Seperator of lyfe is diſpoſed in the figure of the reuolution: for if hee be vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, he denoteth ſicknes and other daungerous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents; If he be fortunate, he holdeth him health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and glad all the yeere. So likewiſe you muſt iudge of the Seperator of goods, friends, dignities &amp; other effects. It is to vnderſtand, that they giue good fortune in the ſaid ſignifications, if they be well diſpoſed: or els loſſe &amp; euill fortune if they be vnfortunate.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, looke if the Lords of the Trypli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of the vitall places be well diſpoſed: and of places which ſignifie riches, honour, trauailes, bretheren, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, wiues and children, doe ſo much. For in the ſame ſignifications the man ſhall be happy or vnhappy, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the ſayd Lords ſhall be wel or euil diſpoſed. And principally you muſt conſider the Lord that ſhall raigne ouer your age: for the firſt Lord of one tryplicity gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the firſt age; the ſecond, the middeſt of the life; the third, the latter yeere.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, you muſt conſider which is the Planet which gouerneth ouer the yeere of your age, that which the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians</hi> call <hi>Fridate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Lorde of the Signe in which ſhall come the ſame yeere of perfection.</p>
               <p>In the fift place, the Lord of the circulation, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by the Lord of the houre of the natiuity.</p>
               <p>Then the Lord of the circulation, accounting by the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2200:59"/>
Lord of the aſcendant of the natiuitie.</p>
               <p>And if in the aſcendant of the natiuitie there be anie Planet, you muſt likewiſe make circulation.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, you muſt looke if any Planet returne to the ſame ſigne and houſe, in the which it was at the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie; for then it intendeth the ſame effect which it hath ſignifyed in the natiuity, principally when it returneth to the ſame ſigne. You muſt alſo haue regard to the aſpects which are made in the reuolution, if they be like to them of the natiuity: for that ſhal be a renuing of the effects of the ſaid aſpects.</p>
               <p>And you muſt not forget the chaunging of the places. For if a happy Plannet bee in the reuolution in the place where an euill Planet was in the natiuity, the euill ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſayd euill Planet in the natiuitie, ſhall be defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that yeere by the preſence of the happy Planet. To the contrary, if a Planet promiſe any good fortune in the natiuitie, and in hys place in the reuolution be any vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Planet, the ſame good ſignifyed in the natiuitie, ſhalbe diminiſhed in the reuolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or loſt by reaſon of the ſaid ill fortune. The miſ-fortune in the places of miſ-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune augmenteth the euill, the good fortunes in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of good fortune, augmenteth the good fortune.</p>
               <p>For to iudge of the ſaid conſiderations, you muſt haue recourſe to that which we haue ſayde in the two former Bookes of generall and particuler ſignifications of the Houſes, Signes, Planets, aſpects, &amp; particuler ſituations of the Planets in ſignes and houſes: hauing alwaies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your eyes, the diſpoſition of ſtarres in the figure of the natiuitie. For if a Planet be in the natiuity greatly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, and in the reuolution well diſpoſed, it cannot much profite becauſe of the firſt infelicity.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe you muſt iudge of thoſe which bee fortunate in natiuities, which being vnfortunate in reuolucions, do no great damage. There be ſome that contemplate here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon, many other things, the which by experience I haue often found vnprofitable, falſe, and ſuperfluous.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. Of profections.</head>
               <p>FOR the profections you muſt reſolue the twelue houſes of your natiuity in equall partes vppon the Eclipſe, ſo farre as the aſcendant is in the firſt degree of any Signe: the ſeconde houſe ſhall be in the fyrſt degree of a ſigne following, and the thirde, in the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of a thirde ſigne: and to conclude, that euery houſe beginne by the fyrſt degree, as the firſt houſe.</p>
               <p>Alſo, euery houſe will containe thirtie degrees, &amp; the firſt thirty degrees of the firſt houſe, ſhall appertaine to the fyrſt yeere wherein the infant is borne; the thirtie of the ſecond, to the ſecond yeere: the thirty of the thirde to the third yeere, &amp; ſo conſequently vntill twelue. Twelue yeeres paſſed, you muſt begin againe at the firſt, and then come to the ſecond, third, fourth &amp;c. and ſo from twelue to twelue you muſt renue the ſame circuite.</p>
               <p>If you finde the reuolution within the thirtie degrees ſeruing to your yeere, it ſignifieth ſome good or euil, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his nature or good or euill diſpoſition, &amp; ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the place, of which ſhall be the ſayd profec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that is to ſay, of the places of lyfe, ſicknes, death, or good health; of the places of goods, riches, loſſe, or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie. &amp;c. Commonly they ſeeke the profection of fyue places of one natiuitie, that is to ſay, of the place of the Sunne for honour; of the place of the Moone for the qualities of the ſpyrit, towardes the body and externall goods; of the place of the parte of Fortune, for gaine and profite; of the tenth houſe for the actions; of the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant for the lyfe.</p>
               <p>If the Sunne be gyuer of lyfe, it muſt be conſidered as gyuer of lyfe and giuer of honor likewiſe, the which you muſt doe alſo in other places, when they import manie ſignifications. If then you finde any Plannet within the thirtie degrees of your profection, and would know what
<pb facs="tcp:2200:62"/>
moneth or day the accident by him ſignifyed ſhal happen.</p>
               <p>Looke what diſtance you haue betweene the firſt point of your profection, and the ſaid Plannet, if there be xv. degrees betweene them, the ſaide accident ſhall happen out in the ende of ſixe moneths: if there be twentie-fiue degrees, at the end of tenne monethes, for heere two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and a halfe, value one moneth, one degree valueth twelue dayes and foure houers, thirty min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>es value ſixe daies, fiue minutes one day.</p>
               <p>Of this there is a verie exact table among the docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Peter Pytat</hi> vpon the Ephemerides. Example of the profections. Suppoſe that the aſcendant of a natiuitie was the fifteene degree of Scorpius, I would know where the profection ſhall light of the aſcendant at the ende of tenne yeeres after the childborne. I account tenne ſignes from the aſcendant, after that, I finde the fifteene degree of Virgo ſeruing after tenne yeeres, accompliſhed to xj. current. I ſay then that in the ſaid time, the profection of the aſcendant is come in the fifteene degree of Virgo; &amp; ſhall end that yeere in the fifteene degree of Libra: and alſo ſhal containe thirty whole degrees, within the which if any Planet be founde, it ſhall ſignifie good or euill of the life, according to the nature &amp; diſpoſition as if in the ſaid time.</p>
               <p>Mars beeing to the fift degree of Libra, I woulde ſay that the infant ſhould be troubled that yeere at the end of eyght moneths, becauſe that Mars was in the place pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionall of life, diſtant from the firſt poynt twentie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drees. We haue ſhewed before that two degrees and a halfe value one month, fiue degrees two monthes, and fifteene degrees ſixe monthes, and by courſe twenty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees eyght monethes. You muſt note, that the profecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ought to fitte to the yeeres currant or complete. It is to be vnderſtoode the tenth ſigne, as for incontinent after nine yeeres complete, which is tenne yeeres currant, &amp;c.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. The Lords of the circulations from the howers of the Natiuities.</head>
               <p>THE Babilonians hold for a great ſecrete, the Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Lord of the hower of the natiuitie? It is to be vnderſtood, that the Lord of the ſaid houre ſignifieth of the life as the aſcendant, and the Lord of the hower following, of goods as of the ſecond houſe: and the Lord of the third hower of bretheren as the third houſe, and ſo conſequently of others.</p>
               <p>In Reuolutions, they giue the Lorde of the hower of the natiuitie to the firſt yeere, the Plannet following to the ſecond, and ſo conſequently following the natural or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Planets.

               <p>THE Eclipſe of the Sunne, and the coniunctions of the Superiour Planets, cauſeth commonly many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, after the congruence of the ſtarres, and nature of the ſignes and Plannets raigning in the ſaide pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to men cauſeth ſickneſſes, when they be within the fiue next degrees of the Aſcendant, or to the gyuer of lyfe: if they touch the other parts, Plannets or houſes, they pronounce euill fortune, appertaining to the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the ſame places; principally, if in the ſame time of the natiuitie, any ſuch conſtellations were in force. If they touch the places perfectionals, they doe almoſt the ſame effect as in natiuities.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XI. Of the particuler meetings of the whole yeere.</head>
               <p>COncerning the particuler meetings of all the yere, <hi>Ptolomeus, Iohn de Regiomonte, Ganrique,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie others, doe reſt harde vppon the Profections, Menſturnes and Diurnes, of the which you haue a perfect Table in the Booke of Directions of <hi>John de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giomonte,</hi> hauing more ſubtiltie &amp; curiouſnes then trueth, as I haue often found by experience.

As for example, let the aſcendant of a natiuitie, or the place of his profection bee the twelfe degree of Libra, the Sunne in the fifteenth of Gemini, Mars in the fifteenth of Leo: alwaies, and as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as the Sunne or the Moone doe paſſe ouer the xv. degree of Leo, the man ſhall bee mooued by angry acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, as of diſpleaſure, of ſome alteration, payne of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2200:63"/>
head, Feauer, hote Impoſtumes, Tetters. &amp;c. Likewiſe when it toucheth the fyft degree of Scorpius, or of Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, there where the quadrate aſpects be within the place of Mars, or the fift of Aquarius, which is the place oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to Mars. If any Planet touch the fift degree of Libra, or of Gemini (there where the Sextile aſpects be) or the fift of Sagitarius and of Aries, (which make the Tryne aſpects of the ſaide Mars) it ſhall ſignifie ſome fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meetings of Captaines and men of warre.</p>
               <p>If the ill fortunes touch not the ſaide twelfe degree of Libra, as we haue ſaid in the Aſcendant, that ſhalbe ſigne of ſome euill meeting, as well to life as to the body. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you muſt iudge of other attouchments, according to the nature of the aſpects, by vs explained in the ſeconde Booke. You muſt contemplate the places profectionals. For I doe apply euerie degree and minute to the dayes in the which their ſignification fall, and regard the good &amp; euill aſpects of the Planets euery day, if they touch the degree profectionall. As for example, of the ſaid natiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the which was the Aſcendant Libra, ſuppoſe that the profection was come to the twelfe degree of Cancer, in the ninth yeere complete and the tenth currant. The thirteenth degree of Cancer, ſerueth to the twelfe day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the proper day of the reuolution.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I conſider then the aſpects of the Planets towards the ſaide thirteenth degree. Likewiſe ſo I do of other degrees and minutes, fitted to thoſe daies in the which they gouerne. And ſo much for Reuolutions.</p>
