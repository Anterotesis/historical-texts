            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

haue many (though not aduerse yet diuerse) rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
especially three: <hi>Praise God in his saints, praise
God in his sanctitie, praise God in his sanctuarie.</hi> S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,
Augustine, Prosper,</hi> and<note n="d" place="margin">Chrysost. Basil. Euthym. Arabs apud Muscul. Lyra. Hugo Card. Turrerecmat. Anonymus.</note> other as well ancient
interpreters as moderne translate here praise God in
his <hi>saints.</hi> For if he must be praised in all his creatures,
how much more in his new creatures: if in the witlesse
wormes, and senselesse vapours, Psal. 148. much more
doubtlesse (as <hi>Theodorit</hi> here collects) in men, in holie
men, in <hi>saints,</hi> vpon whom hee hath out of his<note n="e" place="margin">Ephes. 3. 8. 16.</note> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable
riches of mercie bestowed the blessings of
the<note n="f" place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 8.</note> life present, and of that which is to come.</p>
            <p>First, almightie God is to bee blessed for giuing his
saints such eminent gifts of grace for the good of his
Church, and for the setting foorth of his glorie. So
<hi>Chrysostome, Basil, Euthymius, Prosper, Placidus Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensis</hi>
expound it.<note n="g" place="margin">Iames 1. 17.</note> Euery good and perfit gift is from
aboue descending from the father of lights, a good
thought in a saint is <hi>gratia infusa,</hi> a good word in a
saint is <hi>gratia effusa,</hi> a good deed in a saint is <hi>gratia dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusa,</hi>
through his grace which is the God of<note n="h" place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 10.</note> all grace
saints are<note n="i" place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 10.</note> whatsoeuer they are. Wherefore praise the
Lord in his saints, often remember their vertues as

               <hi>lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
vnto Gods people. So the wise man, Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
44. <hi>Let vs now commend the famous men in old time
by whom the Lord hath gotten great glorie, let the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
speake of their wisdome, and the congregation of their
praise.</hi> So the Confession of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> chap. 17.<note n="l" place="margin">See Harmon. confess. sect. 16. pag. 486.</note> 
               <hi>Wee
teach that the saints are worshipped truly, when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
on certaine daies at a time appointed, doe come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the seruice of God, and doe call to minde and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
vpon his benefits bestowed vpon holie men, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:13293:3"/>
through them vpon his Church,</hi> &amp;c. And for as much as
it is kindly to consider, <hi>opus diei in die suo,</hi> the worke of
the day<note n="m" place="margin">Maior praefat. in Psal. 22.</note> in the same day it was wrought; it is well
ordered by the Church of England, that the most illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
and remarkable qualities of the saints are cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
vpon their proper festiuals, that on S. <hi>Stephens</hi>
day, we may learne by S. <hi>Stephens</hi> example to loue our
enemies: on S. <hi>Matthewes</hi> day, to forsake the world
and to follow Christ: on S. <hi>Iohn the Baptist</hi> his day, to
speake the truth constantly, and to suffer for the same
patiently. Thus in stedfastnes of faith and godlinesse
of life (<hi>non legere modò sed degere sanctorum vitas,</hi> as
<note n="n" place="margin">Owin epigram. lib. 3.</note> one wittily) to bee followers of them as they were
followers of Christ; is (as<note n="o" place="margin">Ser. on Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas day preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Bexterly, &amp; ser<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on S. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens day at Grimstorpe.</note> blessed <hi>Latymer</hi> was wont
to say) the right worshipping of Saints, and of God
in his Saints.</p>
            <p>Againe, for as much as there is a <hi>communion of
Saints,</hi> as we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse in the Creed, a knot of fellowship
betweene the dead Saints and the liuing; it is our dutie
to praise God for their good in particular, as they<note n="p" place="margin">Apocal. 6. 10.</note> pray
to God for our good in generall. It is required on our
part I say, to giue God most humble thanks for transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of this<note n="q" place="margin">Psal. 84. 6.</note> valley of teares into Hierusalem
aboue, where they be<note n="r" place="margin">Apocal. 7. 9.</note> clothed with long white robes,
hauing palmes in their hands, and<note n="s" place="margin">Apocal. 4. 4.</note> crownes of gold on
their heads, euer liuing in that happie kingdome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
either dying or crying, Apocal. 21. 4. and this also
(in the iudgement of <hi>Augustine, Hierome, Hugo, Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerius,</hi>
and other) is to <hi>praise God in his Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These reasons are the grounds of certaine <hi>holy daies</hi>
established in England by law, namely to blesse God
for his Saints eminent grace while they were liuing,
and exceeding glorie now they be dead. Wherein our
Church ascribes not any diuine worship to the Saints,
but all due praise to the sanctifier: in celebrating their
memorie (saith <hi>Augustine</hi>) we neither adore their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
nor implore their helpe: but (according to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:13293:4"/>
tenour of our text) wee praise him alone,<note n="t" place="margin">De ciuit. lib. 8. cap. 27.</note> who made
them both men and martyrs. In the words of<note n="u" place="margin">Tom. 2 fol. 118</note> 
               <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
to <hi>Riparius: Honoramus reliquias martyrum, vt
eum cuius sunt martyres adoremus: honoramus seruos,
vt honor seruorum redundet ad dominum:</hi> If thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to doe right vnto the Saints, esteeme them as pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes,
and not as patrones of thy life; honour them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so farre,<note n="x" place="margin">Philip Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus de missa, lib. 3. cap. 11. See Melanct. resp. ad art. Bauar. art. 25.</note> that thou maist alway praise God in them,
and praise them in God.</p>
            <p>The gunpowder men erre very much in this one
kinde of honouring God, for either they worship <hi>his
Saints</hi> as himselfe, or else their owne saintlings, and
not <hi>his Saints.</hi> In praying to the dead, in mingling the
blood of their martyrs with the precious blood of
their Maker, in applying their merits, and relying vpon
their mercies; it is plaine that they make the Saints (as
<hi>Melancthon</hi> tels them in his<note n="y" place="margin">Tit. de sanct. inuocat.</note> Apologie for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession

bee worshipped publiquely, saying Leuiticus 19. 30.

seruice which is to bee done of vs as the members of a

            <p>Now the workes of God are of two sorts, <hi>ad intra
&amp; ad extra:</hi> some be confined within himselfe, other
extended towards vs: works of the sacred Trinitie
within it selfe (as that the Father begets, and the Sonne
is begotten, and the holy Ghost proceeds from both)
are wonderfull acts of such an high nature that it is our
dutie rather simply to adore, then subtilly to explore
them: all his acts extended toward vs are summarilie
reduced vnto two, namely the works of creation and
redemption.<note n="f" place="margin">Aduancement of learning lib. 2. pag. 116.</note> The worke of creation is attributed in
the Masse of the matter to God the Father, in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the forme to God the Sonne, in the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of both to God the holy Ghost. So likewise that
of redemption, in election vnto God the Father, in the
consummation vnto God the Sonne, in the application
vnto the holy Ghost, all which are very <hi>noble acts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and
God is to be praised in them <hi>according to his excellent
greatnesse.</hi> The worke of creation is so mightie, that
none could bring it to passe but the Father almightie:
that God should haue nothing but nothing, whereof,
wherewith, whereby to build this high, huge, goodly,
faire frame; is a principle which nature cannot teach,
and Philosophie will not beleeue. The worke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
is of farre greater might and mercy, for the
making of the world was (if I may so speke) onely
lip-labour vnto God, <hi>he spake the word and it was done,
be commanded and it stoodfast,</hi> Psalm. 33. 9. but Christ
in redeeming the world said many words, and did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

wonders, and suffered also many wounds. It is true
that the least ake of his least finger is <hi>infiniti meriti, sed
non definiti meriti,</hi> that is of an infinite merit, yet not
that determined ransome for the sinnes of the whole
world. It cost him more to redeeme soules,<note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 4. 25.</note> 
               <hi>he dyed

the greater our deliuerance, the greater our

that our most and best praises are few for the number,
and little for the measure, whereas God is infinite for

he requireth a greater measure, where he bestoweth a

lookes for no little thankes or small praise, but for great
thankes and great praise according to his excellent
