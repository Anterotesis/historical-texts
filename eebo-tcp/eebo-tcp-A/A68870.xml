            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Phoenix of theſe late times: Or the life of M. <hi>Henry Welby</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who lived at his houſe in Gruh-ſtreet forty foure yeares, and was never ſeene by any, aged eighty foure.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> AM to preſent you with one of that rare temperance and abſtinence, that the times paſt, thoſe preſent, or thoſe to come, neither have already, can now, or but with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, may hereafter yeeld a more rare preſident. It is ſaid of <hi>Fredericke</hi> the third Emperor, that when the Phyſitians told him, that his Empreſſe <hi>Auguſta Leonora</hi> (being then barren) if ſhe would drinke Wine, (from which ſhee had abſtained from her youth) in theſe cold parts of
<pb facs="tcp:3648:8"/>
               <hi>Germany,</hi> ſhe might eaſily have iſſue: The Emperor after ſome pauſe aſſented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, but ſaid withall: <hi>Malim uxorem ſterilem, quam vinoſam, I had rather have a wife ſubiect to ſterility, than vinoſity:</hi> which being told unto to her, ſhe made anſwer, True it is, that I am bound in al things to obey the will of my Lord and husband the Emperor; but if on one ſide he would ſet Wine and Life, and on the other my Deniall and Death: I wiſh rather to die, than to drinke it.</p>
            <p>Of abſtinence there be foure kindes: Natural, Miraculous, Violent, and Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary: we call that naturall, when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by nature we abhorre certaine meats, though we be then in good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health, betwixt which and us, there is an antipathy, or elſe, when by ſome diſtaſte or diſeaſe in the ſtomacke, wee loath ſuch things, as our eyes can ſcarce endure to looke upon, much leſſe our palets to taſte, and that is the firſt ſort of abſtinence: the ſecond are ſuch ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
<pb facs="tcp:3648:8"/>
faſts, which we reade of the Saints of God, <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> and of Chriſt himſelfe in the wilderneſſe; all which were for the ſpace of forty dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and theſe are rather for our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, than our imitation. The third, is violent, or compeld, when we faſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have not wherewith to eat, as it hapneth in famine &amp; ſcarcity. The fourth, and laſt is voluntary, which wee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe by our owne counſaile and reaſon, and that is branched into divers ſorts, as Phyſicall, Politicall, Religious, ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, &amp;c. which are largely diſputed of by the learned.</p>
            <p>Faſting, ſaith one of the Fathers, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the minde, enlightneth the ſences, ſubiects the fleſh to the ſpirit, maketh the heart contrite and humble, diſperſeth the clouds of concupiſcence, extinguiſhes the flames of luſt, and ſtrengthneth chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, keeping it within the ſecure bounds of ſincerity and purity; it loveth not ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſity, it hateth ſuperfluity, it deſpiſeth
<pb facs="tcp:3648:9"/>
inſolency, it commends humility, and informeth a mans ſelfe of of his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity: Faſt and Almes are the two godly aſsiſtants unto prayer, and as Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith in his Homilies, ſuch an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence God himſelfe approveth, when that which thou takeſt from thy ſelf, thou diſtributeſt to another, and when thy owne fleſh is puniſhed, the hungry ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke of thy needy neighbour is by thee repleniſhed. He that will faſt as he ought to doe, ſaith a learned <hi>Father,</hi> muſt be in prayer frequent, in iudging iuſt, in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip faithfull, in iniuries patient, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions temperate, from filthy ſpeaking an aliene, to evill deeds averſe, in ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets continent, in charity ſimple, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the crafty cautelous, amongſt the ſad ſorrowfull, amongſt the evill ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers ſilent, amongſt the humble equall, againſt the proud and contumacious da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, in ſuſpicions ſparing; for true abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence is not to forbeare meate, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low vanity, but it is rather to ſeparate thy
<pb facs="tcp:3648:9"/>
ſelfe from ſinne and iniquity: Doſt thou forbeare fleſh, and yet wilt not make it ſcrupulous to feede upon thy brother? abſtaineſt thou from wine, yet cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine thy ſelfe from doing thy neighbor iniury? wilt thou taſte no foode untill the evening, and ſpend the whole day in oppreſsing the fatherleſſe and needy? it little profiteth thee to ſtarve thy body by keeping it from neceſſary viands, if in the meane time thou ſurfeit thy ſoule with ſuperfluity of vices.</p>
            <p>Concerning the ſtrange and ſtrict rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red &amp; cloyſtered life which this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man lived; it cannot be ſaid of him, as it was ſpoke of thoſe, who tooke upon them a Monaſtick life of old, to be in the cloiſter with their bodies, &amp; in the ſtreets in their minde; now within, anon abroad; to ſing one thing, to thinke another; to have a <hi>Pſalme</hi> in their tongues, but not the ſence in their heads; to be in heart deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, in habit diſſolute, to have wandring eies, &amp; wavering thoughts, the ſhape of one
<pb facs="tcp:3648:10"/>
religious, the ſubſtance of one that is ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular, and if he have but the <hi>Cucullus,</hi> (which the old Proverbe ſaith, <hi>non facit mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nachum</hi>) the Hood which maketh not the Monk; all is ſafe, all is well, he apprehends no other hope, hee aimeth at no other happineſſe.</p>
            <p>If thou takeſt upon thee a retired life, what makeſt thou in the multitude? If thou doſt profeſſe ſilence, why prateſt thou abroad amongſt the people? If thou onely profeſſeſt faſt and reares, why doſt thou at any time gurmundize or laugh? Of a retyred man, his ſimplicity is his Philoſophy: but thou wilt ſay, that thy ambition is to teach and inſtruct others; thou oughteſt rather to weepe for them, than to wrangle with them: but if thou doſt cover to be a teacher, know thou what thou haſt to doe; let the vileneſſe of thy habite, the ſincerity of thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, the innocency of thy life, and the ſanctity of thy converſation be their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and preſident, and that is thy
<pb facs="tcp:3648:10"/>
beſt Doctrine and Inſtruction.</p>
            <p>Theſe bee the words of an Ancient and Reverent Father: Theſe our garments (which I weeping ſpeake) ought onely to be the Emblemes of Humility, are worne by the ſeparated men of theſe dayes in all pride and oſtentation; nay, our owne Climes can ſcarcely afford us wherewith to apparrell our ſelves. For the Monke and the Martiall man from the ſame peece of cloth buyeth his Hood and his habite: But Sobriety and Solitude, with volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poverty, are the true Enſignes of all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtick retirement: when thoſe amongſt us, which would pretend themſelves to be recluſiſts, beare their eyes, which ought to be deiected upon the earth, to look ſtill upon the world from whence they came, advance them up towards the Heavens, to looke upon that ſublimity to which they can never attaine: when their feere, that ſhould onely be confined to the Cloyſter, tyre themſelves in needleſſe Iourneys, both in Court, City, and Countrey: when
<pb facs="tcp:3648:11"/>
thoſe Tongues that are vowed unto Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnity and ſilence, are heard in all private and publicke counſells: and when thoſe hands which are ſoly appropriated to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their owne neceſſities, are imployed to ſnatch away the patrimony of others.</p>
            <p>But I come to a third thing moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in this noble Gentleman, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Temperance, which I have read to be thus defined: A moderation of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, obedient to Reaſon; an affection binding and cohibiting the appetite; a mediocrity reſtrayning the luſts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of all carnall affections; a vertue which governeth all the motions of the minde and body, ſo farre, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and agree with the order of perſons, places, and times: The parts thereof are gentleneſſe, liberality, gravity, ſadneſſe, ſeverity, ſhamefaſtneſſe, urbanity, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, benevolence, or good-will, concord, love, peace, continence, clemency, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, meekeneſſe, chaſtity, and honeſty, moderation, taciturnity, frugality, parſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
<pb facs="tcp:3648:11"/>
goodneſſe, purity, and innocence. Shee is likewiſe that light which excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the darkneſſe and obſcurity of paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſhe is of all vertues that are the moſt wholeſome; for as well publickly as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately ſhe doth perſwade humane ſociety; ſhee exalteth the Soule, (wretchedly throwne downe in vice) and reſtoreth her to her priſtine place. Shee is moreover a mutuall conſent of the Soule, cauſing all diſorder and irregularity to take Reaſon for a rule, and diſcretion for a direction. Whoſoever is neither puffed up with praiſe, nor afflicted with adverſity, nor moved by ſlanders, nor corrupted by gifts, is fortunately temperate; for there is nothing in the world better than Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, for by it the aſſaults of the fleſh are ſubdued, and the fruits of a good life are retained: it is rich in loſſes, confident in perills, prudent in aſſaults, and happy in it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>It is the property of <hi>Juſtice</hi> not to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the right of any man, and it is the
<pb facs="tcp:3648:12"/>
Appendix of Temperance to offend no man. He cannot praiſe <hi>Temperance,</hi> who propoſeth his chiefe felicity in <hi>Voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> and <hi>pleaſure,</hi> becauſe it is the grand enemy to riot and exceſſe. <hi>Solon</hi> telleth us, that it plucketh a man from all groſſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and carnall appetites, and letteth him not exceede either in fooliſh reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, nor ungodly ſorrowing; for the pride of the fleſh is to be curbed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained with the ſharpe Bit of <hi>Abſtinence</hi>: As no man can be temperate, unleſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all he be prudent: ſo no man can be held to be truely valiant, unleſſe withall he be temperate. Nay more, <hi>Juſtice</hi> cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt without it, becauſe it is the chiefe point of a iuſt man to keepe his ſoule free from all perturbation: I conclude with that of <hi>Plotinus, Temperance is the Mother of all duty and honeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe three vertues we have ſtrived to illuſtrate vnto your view, but how all theſe accidents meete in one ſubiect, is the Argument now in hand. <hi>Abſtinence</hi> is a
<pb facs="tcp:3648:12"/>
vertue, found in one man, but ſcarcely in another; ſolitude and retyredneſſe of life in few, not in many; and <hi>Temperance</hi> and <hi>Continence</hi> may be imbraced by ſome, not by all; yet all theſe eminent lines meete in this one Center, as the circumſtances following ſhall make apparently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.</p>
            <p>This noble and vertuous Gentleman, M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Henry Welby,</hi> borne in <hi>Lincolne-ſhire,</hi> was the eldeſt ſonne of his Father, and the inheritor of a faire revenue, amounting to a thouſand pounds by the yeere, and upward; firſt metriculated in the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and after made a Student in one of the Innes of Court, where being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated with all the parts of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, hee after retyred himſelfe into the Countrey, and matched nobly unto his good liking: but thinking with himſelfe that the world could not poſſibly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within this Iſland, and that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was but the leaſt peece and member of the whole body of the Vniverſe, hee,
<pb facs="tcp:3648:13"/>
(as many, or the moſt of our young gentlemen doe) had a great minde to travell, as well to profit him in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, as benefit himſelfe in language, and to that purpoſe ſpent ſome few yeares in the <hi>Low Countryes, Germany, France,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> making the beſt uſe of his time, and not like ſome phantaſticke heads, learne onely to drinke with the Dutch-men, comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant with the French-men, ſome aiming onely to fetch <hi>Venus</hi> from <hi>Venice,</hi> others ſtudying to ſteale <hi>Matchievel</hi> out of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> and generally bringing home faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons rather than faith, and many more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces rather than vertues.</p>
            <p>Others alſo by the change of the aire have tooke their advantage to change their religion, which is quite averſe to the old Proverbe, <hi>Coelum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt,</hi> ſuch as croſſe the ſeas, and travell from one Province unto another, though they receive new aire, yet keepe their old
<pb facs="tcp:3648:13"/>
mindes: yet this was verified in him, who well knew no errour to bee ſo dangerous, as that which is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Religion, becauſe therein, and in the conſtant profeſsion thereof, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth our perpetuall happineſſe, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-during felicity, for truth is the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine to a troubled ſpirit; but if erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly taught, it turneth into mortife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous poyſon.</p>
            <p>The ancient Fathers have given their eſpeciall markes, by which, the true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be knowne. Firſt, that it ſerveth the true and onely God. Secondly, that it ſerveth him according to his word. And thirdly, that it reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth that man unto him, which unfeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly followeth it: it is like an even ſquare or ballance, the rule and Canon by which wee are to direct our lives, and the very touch-ſtone which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth truth from falſhood; moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as vices border upon vertues, ſo ſuperſtition reflecteth upon religion,
<pb facs="tcp:3648:14"/>
which Religion doth linke and unite us to ſerve one God with willingneſſe and unanimity; it is the guide and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of all other vertues, and they who doe not exerciſe themſelves therein, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to reſiſt and oppoſe all falſe and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious opinions, are but like thoſe foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and unexpert ſouldiers, who goe to warre without weapons: now if all men (as this Gentleman) would but ſtudy the truth, and ſtrive to perſevere therein, the voluptuous man would therein ſeeke his pleaſure, the gormundizer his ſurfeit, the proud man his oſtent, the avaritious man his wealth, the ambitious man his glory; for it is the onely mediocrity that can fill the vacuum, and emptineſſe of the heart, and ſate and ſatisfie the deſire; it ſerveth alſo for a skilfull Pilot to direct us the way to heaven: when as the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is that blinde guide, which leadeth us the broad and ſpacious paſſage to hell: Briefly, thoſe men may be truely tearmed religious, who refuſing the
<pb facs="tcp:3648:14"/>
vaine and tranſitory pleaſures of the world, wholly ſet their thoughts and mindes on divine contemplations: and ſo much for his religion.</p>
            <p>Now courage and courteſie are the two principal decorements that adorne a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, in neither of which he was any way deficient: For the firſt, as he was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver farre from giving any diſtaſte, ſo hee was never knowne to take any affront; for valour conſiſteth not in hazarding a mans perſon without feare, but to put on a noble reſolution in a iuſt cauſe; neither could this gentleman beare himſelfe ſo innocuouſly in his youth, but that he hath beene inforc't to make proofe of his valor in the field, in which he ſtill came off with honour and advantage, but never boaſting when he had the better, but ſtill ſparing, when he might have ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, holding this maxime, that to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer is naturall, but to pitty heavenly; and it is the property of true courage to out-face danger, conquer by cuſtome,
<pb facs="tcp:3648:15"/>
and end with honour: it contemneth all perills, deſpiſeth calamities, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers death: <hi>Quemcunque magnanimum vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, miſerum neges, None that is magnanimous can be miſerable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bias</hi> holding warre with <hi>Iphicrates</hi> King of <hi>Athens,</hi> and by the diſaſter of Warre being round invironed by his enemies, and his ſouldiers thronging about him, and asking very timorouſly what hee would adviſe them in that extremity to doe, with a bold and undaunted courage anſwered them againe, <hi>Leave me, and ſeeke your owne ſafeties if you be ſo minded, and make report to thoſe that are alive, that your Generall dyed with courage fighting, and I will tell to the dead that you eſcaped from death baſely and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly flying.</hi> But from his <hi>courage,</hi> I come to his <hi>courteſie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a true ſaying, as a Tree is knowne by its Fruit, the Gold by the Touch, and a Bell by the Sound, ſo is a mans Birth by his bounty; his honour by his humility, and his calling by his courteſie, which
<pb facs="tcp:3648:15"/>
not onely draweth unto us the love of ſtrangers, but the liking of our owne Country-men: Mildneſſe and Courteſie are the Characters of an happy ſoule, which never ſuffereth Innocence to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. Proud lookes looſe hearts, but kind words gaine affections: That which is call'd common courteſie, is held to be no courteſie; for hee that is alike kind to all, can be loving to none; for that which is generall, cannot be drawne within the limit of a particular: But the rigour of Diſcipline managing and directing this vertue, and it, againe, being governed by order and diſcretion, the one will illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and commend the other; ſo that neither rigour ſhall ſeeme rough, nor courteſie contemptible; for it ſtandeth in the ſtead of a moderate temperance, dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and adorning a man with mildneſſe and generoſity: for as it is the true note of Nobility, ſo it is the certaine marke of a Gentleman, to be courteous to ſtrangers, patient in iniuries, and conſtant in the
<pb facs="tcp:3648:16"/>
performance of all iuſt promiſes; and for theſe he was knowne to be remarkable.</p>
            <p>To theſe, give me leave to adde ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his liberality and bounty, whoſe beſt honour is in relieving the poore, and greateſt Happineſſe in living in the thoughts of good men: and he well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with himſelfe, that the charity of a liberall man more benefitteth the giver than the receiver. For bounty in giving fraile and mortall things here upon earth, receiveth immortall meede and reward in Heaven. <hi>Hee that is able to give, and giveth not,</hi> (ſaith the Emperour <hi>Aurelius) is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than an enemy; and he that promiſeth a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent benefit, and delayeth the performance thereof, is a ſuſpicious friend.</hi> It is an old ſaying, <hi>There is no greater folly, than to conferre a courteſie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an old man, or a childe, the one being likely to dye before he can requite it, the other being ſo young, that he is not able to remember it</hi>: But his bounty was knowne to be free, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and without reſpect of Age, Sexe, or perſons. But ſuch is the corruptneſſe and
<pb facs="tcp:3648:16"/>
abuſe of theſe times, that the memory of a benefit doth ſoone vaniſh away, but the remembrance of an iniury will ſticke in the heart for ever. But this is a Law that ought to be obſerved betwixt the giver and the receiver, that the one ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly forget the gift hee hath beſtowed, and the other ſhould alwayes have it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance: It alſo becommeth him much better to hold his peace that giveth a reward, that it becommeth him to be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that receiveth a benefit. But his libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ingeniouſly confeſſeth) conſiſted in giving with iudgement.</p>
            <p>This was the manner of his behaviour and carriage of life for the ſpace of Forty yeeres, (I meane till hee arrived at that age) being reſpected by the rich, prayed for by the poore, and indeed, generally belov'd; having a Daughter beauteous and vertuous, furniſh't with all the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment that either <hi>Nature</hi> could give, or <hi>Education</hi> and <hi>Inſtruction</hi> adorne and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie, who was eſpouſed to a <note n="*" place="margin">Sir <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Hilliard</hi> in Yorke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</note> Knight of
<pb facs="tcp:3648:17"/>
good deſcent, and a noble Family, to the Fathers great ioy and comfort: but as all mundane happineſſe is fading, and all earthly delights tranſitory, to day wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to morrow withering; now flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, and anon flagging: ſo it fared with this worthy Gentleman, who late invironed with all the felicity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments of this world, was almoſt in a moment abandon'd and retired from all the pleaſures and delights of the world.</p>
            <p>The occaſion whereof, (ſome ſay) was the unkindneſſe, or (which I may rather tearme it) the unnaturalneſſe and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of a younger brother, who upon ſome diſcontent or diſpleaſure conceived againſt him, raſhly and reſolutely threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his Death: But this innocent Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman meaſuring the diſpoſitions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by himſelfe, and not imagining ſuch barbarous cruelty could be in man, of what condition ſoever, much leſſe in a Brother, hee held them as the raſh mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="tcp:3648:17"/>
of unbridled youth, which by good counſel, or complying with the others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, might be eaſily reclaimed, reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as words that would never breake into wounds, and doubtfull lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage that could not eaſily beget danger: and as true Innocence goeth ſtill arm'd with confidence, and he that is guiltleſſe, ſtill dreadleſſe; ſo hee neither feared his courage, nor ſhunned his company, till at the length the two Brothers meeting face to face, the younger drew a Piſtoll charged with a double Bullet from his ſide, and preſented upon the elder, which onely gave fire, but by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous providence of GOD no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther report: at which the elder ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing upon the younger, diſarmed him of his tormentary Engine, and without any further violence offered, ſo left him: which bearing to his chamber, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to finde whether it were onely a falſe fire, meerely to fright him; or a charge, ſpeedily to diſpatch him: when
<pb facs="tcp:3648:18"/>
he found the Bullets, and apprehended the danger hee had eſcap't, hee fell into many deepe conſiderations: For wiſe men will alwayes uſe circumſpections, and firſt conſider what to doe, before they conclude any thing: Now the cauſes that beget this deliberation and counſell with our ſelves, are feare, care, neceſſity, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: Feare afflicteth, care compelleth, neceſſity bindeth, affection woundeth: his feare afflicted him, leſt hazarding himſelfe to the like danger, he might be the occaſion of ſhortning his owne inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent life, and haſtening his brothers ſhamefull and infamous death: his care compell'd him by his future cautelous carriage to prevent both: neceſſity bound him in meere fraternall piety, to prevent all future occaſions that might preiudiſe either of them in ſo high and horrid a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and laſtly, his affection ſo farre and ſo deepely wounded him, that ſince, where he expected the love of a Brother, hee had found the malice of an enemy,

ſince hee could not enioy his face with ſafety, he would ever after deny the ſight of his owne face to all men whatſoever.</p>
            <p>And upon the former conſiderations he grounded this irrevocable reſolution, which he kept to his dying day; which that he might the better obſerve, he took a very faire Houſe in the lower end of <hi>Grub-ſtreete,</hi> neare unto <hi>Cripple-gate,</hi> and having contracted a numerous retinue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a private and ſmall family, having the houſe before prepared for his purpoſe, hee entred the doore, chuſing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe out of all the roomes three private chambers, beſt ſuiting with his intended ſolitude: The firſt for his Diet, the ſecond for his Lodging, and the third for his Study, one within another: and the while his Dyet was ſet on the Table by one of his ſervants an old Mayd, hee rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into his lodging-chamber, and while his Bed was making, unto his Study, ſtill doing ſo, till all was cleare: and there he ſet up his reſt, and in Forty foure yeeres
<pb facs="tcp:3648:19"/>
never, upon any occaſion, how great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, iſſued out of thoſe chambers, till he was borne thence upon mens ſhoulders; neither in all that time did Sonne in law, Daughter, or Grand-child, Brother, Siſter, or Kinſman, ſtranger, Tenant, or ſervant, young, or old, rich, or poore, of what degree or condition ſoever, looke upon his face, ſaving the ancient Maid, whoſe name was <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who made his fire, prepared his bed, provided his dyet, and dreſt his Chamber; which was very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or upon an extraordinary neceſſity that he ſaw her; which Maid-ſervant dyed not above ſixe dayes before him.</p>
            <p>As touching his Abſtinence in all the time of his retirement, hee never taſted Fleſh, nor Fiſh; hee never dranke either Wine, or ſtrong water; his chiefe food was Oat-meale boyled with water, which ſome call Gruell; and in Summer, now and then a Sallet of ſome choiſe coole hearbs. For dainties, or when hee would feaſt himſelfe upon an high day,
<pb facs="tcp:3648:19"/>
he would eate the yelke of an hens egge, but no part of the white; and what bread he did eat, he cut out of the middle part of the loafe, but of the cruſt he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taſted; and his continuall drinke was foure ſhillings beere, and no other; and now and then, when his ſtomacke ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, he did eate ſome kinde of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets; and now and then dranke redde Cowes milke, which his maid <hi>Elizabeth</hi> fetcht for him out of the fields hot from the Cow: and yet he kept a bountifull table for his ſervants, with entertainment ſufficient for any ſtranger or tenant, that had any occaſion of buſineſſe at his houſe.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> holy-dayes, at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and upon all ſolemne feſtivall dayes, he had great cheare provided, with all diſhes ſeaſonable with the times, ſerved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his owne Chamber with ſtore of wine, which his maid brought in; when he himſelfe (after thanks given unto God for his good benefits) would
<pb facs="tcp:3648:20"/>
pinne a cleane Napkin before him, and putting on a paire of white holland ſleeves, which reached to his elbowes, call for his knife, and cutting diſh after diſh up in order, ſend one to one poore neighbour, the next to another, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were Brawne, Beefe, Capon, Gooſe, &amp;c. till hee had left the table quite empty: Then would he give thanks againe, lay by his linnen, put up his knife againe, and cauſe the cloath to be taken away; and this would he doe Dinner and Supper upon theſe dayes without taſting one morſell of any thing whatſoever; and this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome he kept to his dying day, an abſtinence farre tranſcending all the Carthuſean Monkes, or Mendicant Fryars, that I ever yet could read of.</p>
            <p>Now as touching the ſolitude of his life, to ſpend ſo many Summers and Winters in one ſmall or narrow roome, dividing himſelfe not onely from the
<pb facs="tcp:3648:20"/>
ſociety of men, but debarring himſelfe from the benefit of the freſh and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable aire; not to walke or to confer with any man, which might either ſhorten the tediouſneſſe of the night, or mitigate the prolixneſſe of the day: what retirement could be more? or what reſtriction greater? in my opinion it far ſurpaſſeth all the Veſtals and Votaries, all the Ancreſſes and Authors that have beene memorized in any Hyſtory. Now if any ſhall aske me how he paſt his houres, and ſpent his time? no doubt, as he kept a kinde of perpetuall faſt, ſo hee devoted himſelfe unto continuall prayer, ſaving thoſe ſeaſons which hee dedicated to his ſtudy; for you muſt know, that hee was both a Scholler and a Linguiſt; neither was there any Author worth the reading, either brought over from beyond the ſeas, or publiſht here in the kingdome, which he refuſed to buy, at what deare rate ſoever; and theſe were his companions in
<pb facs="tcp:3648:21"/>
the day, and his Councellors in the night; inſomuch, that the ſaying may bee verified of him, <hi>Nunquam minus ſolus, quam cum ſolus</hi>: He was never better accompanied, or leſſe alone, then when alone.</p>
            <p>I need not ſpeak much of his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, ſince that doth neceſſarily include it ſelfe in the former. Abſtinence is a faſt from meates and vice, but continence is a continuance in all the foure cardinall vertues: what ſhould I ſay? his continence he expreſt in the time he lived in the world, and his abſtinence in the greater part of his age, after he had ſeparated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from the world: every man is known by his actions; neither is any man to bee accounted a good man for his age, but for his charitable deedes; it is moſt true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that ſuch an one as we call good, is better than the good he doth, and a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man is worſe than the evill that he is able to doe. But in this gentleman, the thing moſt worthy our obſervation is,
<pb facs="tcp:3648:21"/>
that he, who was borne to ſo faire for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and might have enioyed proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for his ſoules ſake, and to enioy the pleaſures of a future world, ſhould ſtudy adverſity; to have much, and enioy little; to be the Lord of all, and a ſervant to all; to provide for others to eate, whilſt hee prepared himſelfe to faſt; and out of his great plenty to ſupply others, whilſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe wanted: and ſo much for his great continence; but all this while I am come to no particulars of his charity.</p>
            <p>Charity (ſaith Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>) is the ſcope of all Gods commandements: it ranſometh from ſinne, and delivereth from death: for as the body without the ſoule can enioy no life, ſo all other vertues without charity, are meerely cold and fruitleſſe: ſhe in adverſity is patient, in proſperity temperate, in paſsions ſtrong, in good workes active, in temperance ſecure, in hoſpitality bountifull, amongſt her true chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ioyfull, amongſt her falſe friends
<pb facs="tcp:3648:22"/>
patient; and the onely meaſure to love God, is to love him without meaſure: moreover, it maketh a man abſolute and perfect in all other vertues, for there is no vertue perfect without love, nor any love that can be truely ſincere with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out charity: a poore man being in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is rich, but a rich man without cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is poore: Charity and Pride both feed the poore, but after divers ſorts; the one to the praiſe and glory of God, the other to purchaſe praiſe and glory with men; the firſt concerneth him, the latter not.</p>
            <p>He was no Phariſee, to ſeeke the praiſe and vaine oſtent amongſt men; neither did he blow a trumpet before him when he gave his almes; neither when any impudently clamord at his gate, were they therefore immediately releeved; but hee out of his private chamber, which had a proſpect into the ſtreete, if he ſpyed any ſicke, weake, or lame, would preſently ſend after them, to
<pb facs="tcp:3648:22"/>
comfort, cheriſh, and ſtrengthen them, and not a trifle to ſerve them for the preſent, but ſo much as would releeve them many dayes after. Hee would moreover inquire, what neighbours were induſtrious in their callings, and who had great charge of children, and withall, if their labour and induſtry could not ſufficiently ſupply their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; to ſuch he would liberally ſend, and releeve them according to their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities; and this was charity as it ought to bee; for ſo our beſt Divines have defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it.</p>
            <p>I cannot reckon up the leaſt of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites in this nature done by him, and therefore I leave them to the favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable conſideration of the charitable and underſtanding Reader, thus concluding, He may not improperly be cal'd a <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix:</hi> for as in his life he might be tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a Bird of Paradiſe, ſo in his death he might be compared to that <hi>Arabian Monady,</hi> who having lived foureſcore and
<pb facs="tcp:3648:23"/>
foure yeares, halfe in the world, and halfe from the world, built his owne fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall neſt or pile, compoſed of the <hi>Tebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> and <hi>Cinnomon,</hi> inter-woven with <hi>Onix</hi> and <hi>Galbanum,</hi> with the ſweete and odoriferous ſmells of <hi>Myrrh, Aloes,</hi> and <hi>Caſſia</hi>; and ſo made his death-bed an Altar, and his godly zeale kindling thoſe ſweete ſpices, ſent up his ſoule in an acceptable Incenſe, to that bleſſed and ſacred Throne, where a contrite heart, and humble ſpirit were never deſpiſed.</p>
