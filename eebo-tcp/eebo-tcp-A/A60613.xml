            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF becauſe there appear ſome remarks of ancient
Solemnity upon this time, and becauſe the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
Liturgy doth oblige us to a religious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to it, any man ſhould inquire after the reaſon
and intention of both, the queſtion will be eaſily
ſolved, if he do but heed the name and appellation of
it, as it is commonly called the Rogation-week, or the
Week of Prayers, that is, a time choſen and ſeparated by
the Churches Wiſdom and Authority for Faſting and
Prayers, the more ſolemnly to implore the mercy of God
upon the World at a ſeaſon, when commonly the rage
of Epidemic diſeaſes takes its beginning, the fruits of the
Earth are in greateſt danger to miſcarry, and Wars are
then ordinarily commenced, and Campagnes opened.
Now this pious cuſtom was ſo early an off-ſpring of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Devotion, that it was made a Conſtitution of
the Church from a conſiderable Antiquity, and hath
been ever ſince obſerved in moſt places of the Chriſtian
World, and particularly in all the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches
ever ſince the Reformation, to this very day.</p>
            <p>But how pious and reaſonable, how ancient and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
ſoever the obſervation hath been, yet the demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhers
of our Rites and Order, have ſo prevailed with
the people, that there's ſcarcely one of a hundred, that
underſtands their duty in it, nor one of a thouſand that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40199:4"/>
have conſcionably and duely practiſed and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it.</p>
            <p>And yet I don't deſpair, but that ſome pious perſons
here before me, may be ſo affected with this ſhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their duty therein, that they may in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
anſwer the intention of this ancient Eſtabliſhment,
and the Command of this preſent Church to obſerve it.</p>
            <p>Which that they may the better do, I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to accommodate them with a ſuitable ſubject
for their encouragement and direction, and that from
the words now propounded. <hi>Pray without ceaſing,</hi> or
<hi>continually.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which words offer theſe two occaſions of diſcourſe.<list>
                  <item n="1">1. What is meant by continually praying, and how
far the command of God lays upon us on that account.</item>
                  <item n="2">2. The reaſonableneſs of obſerving that command ſo
repreſented, by ſeveral inſtances of advantages to engage
us to the conſtant practice and performance of it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. What is meant by praying without ceaſing or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually?</p>
            <p>And for the true underſtanding of this according to
the ſeveral ways of ſpeaking, which the beſt Interpreters
have uſed, it ſignifies ſuch an habitual frame and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
ſtate of mind, whereby we may and do ſo often
perform the duty of prayer as is conſiſtent with the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of other duties of Religion, and our neceſſary
attendance upon the common buſineſs and affairs of the
world in our lawful imployments, and that may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
comply with our natural infirmities as men. And in
this we ought to have reſpect both to the private and
publick performance of the Duty.</p>
            <p>And then by praying continually as to the <hi>firſt</hi> I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40199:4"/>
the well management of our Devotions, as to
thoſe which we call private Prayers. Whether they be
thoſe of the Cloſet, which our Saviour mentions (<hi>Mat.</hi>
6.) or thoſe between married perſons, which a great
Divine of our Church ſuppoſed the Apoſtle to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated
as a duty, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 5. or whether thoſe of the
family, where every ſupreme in it is a kind of Prieſt to
God, to order the periods and circumſtances of Gods
ſervice in his own houſe. And that man that hath given
rules to himſelf for the ordinary performance of thoſe
ſeveral offices, ſuch as a wiſe Guide of Souls may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
and the practice of other holy perſons have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified,
may be believed to have performed the duty
of praying without ceaſing, ſo far as concerns his private
Devotion.</p>
            <p>But then ſecondly, by the performance of the duty
of praying continually as to the Publick Prayers, I mean
a conſtant attendance upon them in all ſuch appointed
periods, which the Governors of every Chriſtian Church
muſt be ſuppoſed to have determined to be performed
in ſome publick place ſet apart and conſecrated to that
ſervice of God; whether they be in ſome certain ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the year, as this week of Rogation is one, or in
ſo many days in the week, as by the frequent ſucceſſions
of the Lords day and other Feſtivals, and Faſts, or in ſo
many divided portions of the day; and in all other
contingent occaſions of Chriſtians aſſembling together
for the ſervice of God.</p>
            <p>Which Periods being ſo ſet apart for God, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for our duty, do ſo indiſpenſably oblige the
Conſciences of men, that no man can make a wilful omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of them (eſpecially if it be habitual) but he may be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40199:5"/>
interpreted to have ſo far departed from God, and
thrown himſelf off from his protection and bleſſing. And
becauſe I ſee the neglect of this duty to be ſo univerſal,
(and amongſt them particularly that otherwiſe pretend
themſelves to be a praying people to a greater degree
than others) I deſire but once to know from any of them
what they can object againſt the obligation that I have
affirmed to lay upon their Conſciences, ſo as may ſolve
their omiſſion to a conſiſtency with any real ſenſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
or the fear of God.</p>
            <p>I hope they don't imagine the perſonal faults of them
that adminiſter, or the different manner of the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of thoſe Offices (as with ſuch Rites and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
which they perhaps diſlike (becauſe they will)
and God hath not forbidden them, while the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Worſhip is preſerved entire) can acquit them for
their groſs diſobedience to God and man, and the into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
prejudice they make and encourage againſt the
Governors, the Eſtabliſhment, and the obedient Sons of
the conſtituted Church, with which they are bound to
hold Communion in ſuch publick Offices.</p>
            <p>Now that man that ſhall religiouſly and conſtantly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
all ſuch determin'd and commanded Periods, for
the Service of God in publick, may be ſaid to perform
all that's obligatory in the Command of God for praying
without ceaſing, or continually in this ſecond reſpect.
And I think I may affirm, that the Apoſtle did princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
intend this kind of praying continually, by the
command in my Text: and my reaſon is, becauſe I find
the ſame, and the like expreſſion to be neceſſarily ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted,
in other places of Scripture.</p>
            <p>Thus when it's ſaid, that <hi>Hannah</hi> went not out of the
Temple, but ſerved God with faſtings and prayers night
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40199:5"/>
and day (<hi>Luke</hi> 2. 37.) the meaning is, that ſhe never
failed to diſcharge her duty there, at all the appointed
ſeaſons of the Jewiſh Church. And when the Apoſtles,
after Chriſts Reſurrection, were ſaid to be continually in
the Temple, bleſſing and praiſing God (<hi>Luk. ult. ult.</hi>) as
it may be obſerved what veneration they had to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
place the Temple, of which their (<gap reason="foreign" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) upper
Room was a part; ſo their being continually there, muſt
mean that they made attendance to their Offices at all
ſet hours, probably at thoſe which were then in cuſtom
among the Jews, that is, at every third hour of the day.
And of this practice we have ſeveral footſteps in the
ſtory of their Acts: and ſo <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> went up to
the Temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour
(our three a clock) <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 1. Which cuſtom was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in ſome reſemblance continued in the Church, of
which S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> makes mention in his Diſcourſe upon
the Lords Prayer.</p>
            <p>And when in thoſe appointed ſeaſons they carefully
made their attendancies, they might be ſaid (in the moſt
reaſonable ſenſe) to have prayed continually, as to the
publick performance of the Duty.</p>
            <p>Thus I have diſcharged my ſelf of the firſt occaſion of
my Diſcouſe from the word <hi>continually,</hi> or <hi>without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</hi>
The next that I am to addreſs to, is, to ſhew the
reaſonableneſs of our making ſuch a conſtant attendance
upon all the Offices of Prayer, to which we have either
piouſly obliged our ſelves in private, or are commanded
to by Authority in Publick, by ſeveral inſtances of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
advantages by it.</p>
            <p>And the firſt inſtance is, That a continual attendance
upon ſuch Offices, is a continued payment of that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
we owe to God, as he is the great Creator, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor,

and Preſerver of the World, and an imply'd own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to be the Soveraign Lord of all his Creatures, to

thereby we do daily make an acknowledged dependance

move, and have our being</hi> (<hi>Acts</hi> 17.) and <hi>that from him
deſcends every good and perfect gift</hi> (<hi>Jam.</hi> 1.)</p>
            <p>Whereas an habitual omiſſion of ſuch Duties, amongſt
all the evils of their neglect, may be recounted a kind
of dethroning God from his ſupreme Dominion, and be
interpreted a diſclaiming his univerſal Soveraignty over
his created World, and indeed no ſmall degree of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical

of ſecond Cauſes, which they called Fate, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
a Providence: I ſay I know not, but thoſe Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
might as juſtly be acquitted for the Errours of
their Speculative, as the neglecters and deſpiſers of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
may be excuſed from doing God as great a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
by their practical Atheiſm.</p>
            <p>And therefore I cannot but wonder, that any man
that ſeriouſly believes that there is either a God, or a
Providence, ſhould not make addreſſes to the Majeſty of
his Perſon for the acknowledgment of his Soveraignty,
and the devouteſt applications to his love and goodneſs
for their own ſafety and protection, by the daily tender
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40199:7"/>
of their Prayers and Supplications at all ſeaſons both
publick and private.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond inſtance of the reaſonableneſs of ſuch
a conſtant attendance upon Gods Service in prayer is,
becauſe as it profeſſeth a belief of, ſo it makes and gives
a continued uſe and improvement to, that very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
part of our Redemption, the never-ceaſing Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of Chriſt, who now ſits at Gods right hand, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
the tender of mens Petitions, and as a Prieſt for
ever to be daily offering up to God, as the private ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
of his Servants, ſo alſo the conjoyned Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of devout Aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>But when thoſe Offices are neglected, we do as much
as in us lies to fruſtrate that grand Expedient of all our
ſpiritual and temporal bleſſings; and may interpretative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be ſaid, to put ſuch an undervalue upon it, as to be
thought guilty of treading under foot the Son of God,
of counting the Blood of the Covenant a profane thing,
and of doing deſpight to the Spirit of Grace (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.
29.) All which three terrible expreſſions of Guilt, and
danger, do clearly refer to their ſinful cuſtom of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking
Aſſemblies (<hi>v.</hi> 25.)</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third inſtance of the advantage of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
attendance upon Prayers publickly and privately
is, that thereby we are continually upon our guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe Armies of Temptations that march about us,
under the Conduct of the Devil and the World, which
are continually invading and aſſaulting our innocency;
and that thereby we are continually countermining the
ſecret Plots and Stratagems of our own deceitful Luſts,
which are always warring againſt our Souls.</p>
            <p>And this I offer not only as Prayers are the means of
Grace in general, but as they are really effective of a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40199:8"/>
proper defence againſt the temptations to every ſin in
particular and in its kind. How hardly can that tongue
be conquered to comply with the common modes of
oaths and curſings, blaſphemies, and rants againſt God
and Goodneſs, that was juſt now tinctured with words
of holy applications to God in religious offices? Or how
can thoſe feet be ſwift to ſhed blood, or be travelling
to the places of villany and debauchery, that were juſt
before treading the Courts of Gods houſe, or helped us
to yield our bodies to the proſtrate poſtures of ſolemn
Aſſemblies? Or can the thoughts of that man be readily
ingaged in the purſuit of any ſinful deſigns or ſatiſfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
who juſt before had hallowed his mind with reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
intentions, and ſanctified his heart with the holy
offices of Prayer?</p>
            <p>Further, that holy duty daily performed, will fortifie
us againſt the daily incurſions of temptations, by keeping
alive in us to the laſt, that grand preſervative of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
our natural, and our acquired habit of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
modeſty, and by accommodating our paſsions (the
common ſeat of moſt ſins) to Religion and Vertue. <hi>Is
any man afflicted</hi> (or ſad?) <hi>let him pray,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
(<hi>Jam.</hi> 5.) that is, the conſtant attendance on that
duty will alleviate the burden of a ſorrowful and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
mind? <hi>Is any man merry? let him ſing Pſalms:</hi>
that is, let him gratifie the preſent pleaſantneſs of his
Soul in ſuch Aſſemblies, where the praiſes of God are
managed with the ſweet accents of muſical harmonies,
to prevent the exceſſes of ſenſual joys, and the ſordid
mirth of ſinful ſocieties. Can any man complain that
his own natural conſtitution, or the untowardneſs of the
inſtruments of his affairs, or the common unworthy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of other men to him, do daily tempt him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40199:8"/>
of impatience, frowardneſs, and periodick fits of
anger? let him here ſeek and attempt his remedy, and by
experience he ſhall find, that his frequent ingagement in
religious offices will allay thoſe ſtorms, and reduce his
temper to the quietneſs and ſweet eaſineſs of a Lamb or
Dove. Laſtly, Is any man ſurpriz'd with the ruling
paſſion of a ſenſual love? let him imitate the example
of that wiſe and excellent Virgin, of whom I have read,
that ſhe commanded her fond Amoriſt to reſpite his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
to her, till he and her ſelf had compleated forty
days in Faſting and Prayer, by which religious expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ſhe cured his folly, and preſerved her own inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth Inſtance of advantage by our conſtant
attendance upon God in Prayer, is, becauſe that duty
is the common Scene and opportunity for the exerciſe
and improvement of all ſpiritual Graces; which as they
were attained by the uſe of means, ſo are they maintained
and improved by the conſtant practices of vertue, and
the ſervices of our God: And as the exerciſe of every
particular duty improves its proper Grace, ſo does the
duty of Prayer imploy and improve them all.</p>
            <p>Firſt as to Faith, every period in our Devotions is an
act of that Faith by which a juſt man is ſaid to live to
God, and to all the purpoſes of a religious Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Then as to Hope, our conſtant Prayers feed it,
and confirm it, and make the expectation of a future
bliſs lively and prevailing. There we are exerciſing and
acting the precious Grace of Humility, making our
ſelves duſt and aſhes in the apprehenſion of our ſelves
towards God, and are tempering our hearts for all kinds
of ſubmiſſion and condeſcenſion to men.</p>
            <p>Here the Virgin ties on her girdle of Chaſtity, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40199:9"/>
the married pair are every day renewing their firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troth,
and faſtning the knot of their promiſed love and
fidelity to one another. Here the Subject does daily
profeſs his Loyalty upon his knees, and guards the Crown
and engageth his Faith for his Princes ſafety. Here we
diſcipline all our inclinations to malice and revenge;
here we forgive every treſpaſs, and are ſoftening our
Souls for admiſsion of terms of peace and reconciliation
with all the World. In a word, our conſtant attendance
on that duty will every day more and more be raiſing
our hearts up to a pitch of heavenly Converſation with
God and Angels, and preparing us to be fit Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of that bleſſed Society above, when God ſhall pleaſe
to call us to it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The fifth Inſtance of advantage which makes our
conſtant attendance upon all religious offices highly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
is, becauſe it will make our time, our precious
time, more accountable to God and our ſelves, by adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it into fit portions for the ſervice of God. For if
men were as curious of conſidering what accounts muſt
be made of all the Talents with which they are intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in order to the ſecuring their future Bliſs, they would
begin to think that that of Time, which God hath put in
our power, and left to our choice, for the good or bad
imployment of it, were as conſiderable as any.</p>
            <p>And if they would recount the mercy of enjoying
Time, or foreſee the conflicts of a dying Soul, when he
is lamenting the loſs of it, they would be as adviſable in
this point, as in any other concern of Religion. Now
no propoſal can be offered to a mind truly pious, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
a man may better ſecure his time for a fair account
with God, than by apportioning a conſiderable part of
it in attendance upon the offices of Prayer, in the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40199:9"/>
choſen or appointed for it. At which ſeaſons we
ſhould no more wilfully take a liberty to withdraw our
ſelves from our duty, whether when our Cloſets or our
Families, or when the ſet hours of Prayers at Gods Houſe
call for it, than we would lay our Conſciences waſte, by
committing an enormous act of ſin.</p>
            <p>And as ſuch a courſe of ſpending time will make that
Talent of our lives happily accountable to God, ſo will
an habituation of our ſelves to perform our duty at ſuch
appointed ſeaſons, make our time eaſie and acceptable
to our ſelves: (it's idleneſs and ſin that makes time a
burden, and our lives uneaſie) and we ſhould with the
ſame pleaſure think of thoſe periods of Prayers, as we
do entertain the ſeaſons of our natural refreſhments of
meat and ſleep, and as delightfully recount the hours of
the day by them, as by any artificial diviſion of time:
and make us go as cheerfully to our devotions, when the
Bell tolls, as when it rings us to our meals, or ſounds a
retreat to our labours, or as when the ſetting Sun tells
the wearied Traveller that his journey is at an end.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The ſixth and laſt Inſtance, by which it will appear
that the conſtant attendance upon the offices of Prayer,
muſt needs be reaſonable, is, becauſe it will be a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
part of the diſcharge of the command of God
upon us, to ſhew mercy, and to do good to thoſe that
need our help and relief.</p>
            <p>For amongſt the various capacities of doing good that
God hath put in our power, one is, that we can ſuccour
and relieve the infelicities of the World, by the Charity
of our Prayers. By them we can get bread at Gods
hand for the diſtreſſed, as well as give it with our own.
By them we can reach the ſorrows of the Widow, and
the heavily afflicted, and paſs through the Walls and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40199:10"/>
Bars of Priſons, to ſupport and comfort the mourning
Captive. By them we can fight for the Prince and the
Church, when both in danger. By theſe we can clear
the infectious Air in raging Peſtilences, and water the
dry Furrows when parched with drought, and fortifie
our Peace when threatned with the Alarms of War:
with all other the inſtances of doing good that hold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
with theſe.</p>
            <p>Now what can acquit any man to God or man, that
underſtands his indiſpenſable obligation of doing all the
good he can, and can believe what God hath promiſed
and done, to aſſure him of the ſucceſs of his Prayers; I
ſay how can any man acquit himſelf to God and man,
that ſhall refuſe any offices, or neglect any of thoſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,
when Prayers are to be put up to God for
either the common or the particular bleſſings of them
that need them?</p>
            <p>I wiſh the Conſciences of men that have any deſigns
for Religion (and they are infinitely unreaſonable that
have none) were ſufficiently informed, and ſeriouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
in this caſe: our Aſſemblies would not be ſo thin,
nor ſo unconcerned, when we are every day crying out
for mercy, and pleading for bleſſings.</p>
            <p>Now it is in this laſt Inſtance of advantage by our
conſtant attendance to this duty, that we are at this time
eſpecially concerned: and therefore as upon this ground
the ancient Churches took their juſt plea, for the firſt
eſtabliſhing a Week of Prayers, and why our Church
have continued the obligation to obſerve it, ſo I ſhall
there only fix my Application.</p>
            <p>And then I ſay, That if ever there were an Age that
called for this kind of Charity, and might lay claim to
the benefit of a Week of Rogations, and all other the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40199:10"/>
conſtantly performed offices of prayers for the good of
Mankind, as neceſſary; it is now certainly the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
time: the ſad face, and deplorable ſtate of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
World, every where do now require it, now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
it.</p>
            <p>And firſt the deeply afflictied <hi>Aſiatic</hi> and <hi>Grecian</hi>
Churches, the firſt Plantations of Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
that have ſo long groaned under the heavy oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of him that bids defiance to the Chriſtian name,
lays claim to the Charity of your Prayers. But thoſe
<hi>Barbarians</hi> late approaches and ſucceſſes muſt alarm
your pity, if you can but conſider the <hi>Hungarian</hi> and
<hi>Polonian</hi> calamities.</p>
            <p>But if theſe diſtant accents of ſorrow cannot reach
your hearts, yet let the near and loud Cry of thoſe
neighbouring Countries, that are haraſſed and undone
by the conflicting Legions of ſo many Princes now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in War, awaken you to your moſt compaſſionate
Prayers.</p>
            <p>Let us have a care, that thoſe poor ruined Countries
may not take up <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> Lamentation againſt us, <hi>O
all ye that not only paſs, but live by us, have ye no regard?</hi>
(<hi>Lam.</hi> 1.) O that God ſhould lay it to your charge,
as he did once to his people by his Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi>
(<hi>Chap.</hi> 6.) <hi>That we lye upon the beds of Ivory, and ſtretch
our ſelves upon our Couches, &amp;c.</hi> that we are drinking
wine in bowls, immerſt in all ſenſual pleaſures, and are
not grieved for the afflictions of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> nor charitably
concerned for their calamities. O to your prayers, and
let your earneſt ſupplications put a ſtop to the flames of
Gods raging diſpleaſure againſt them, leſt for our ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
and uncompaſſion, God ſhould change the ſad
Scene, and afterwards make them Spectators of our
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40199:11"/>
ruines, that are ſuch uncharitable beholders of their
miſeries.</p>
            <p>But if the diſtant Alarms of Foreign Calamities can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
awaken us from our lethargic unconcernedneſs, yet
ſure there is ſomething at home, that may more nearly
affect us, and that may implore the charity of our daily
Devotions.</p>
            <p>And if there were nothing but the common miſeries
of Mankind among us, ſuch as uſually and univerſally
follow Nations in their beſt peace and proſperity, yet
no pious and conſiderate mind could want a ſufficient
ſubject matter for ſuch offices of his Charity: Let us but
conſider how many poor Priſoners are now ſorrowing
in their ſtrait confinements, how many of our brethren
are roaring in torments, languiſhing in diſeaſes, pinched
with penury, ſtrugling with difficulties to live, and in a
thouſand caſes of diſtreſs, are crying for help in the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs
of their Souls. And can we think there's never a
tear, never a petition due? Do theſe need no ſhare in a
time of Prayer, no concern in the offices of our daily
Devotions?</p>
            <p>But beſides this, cannot a wiſe and pious heart, as
things are at preſent, find any thing elſe, that begs the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his Prayers? Is there no caſe, wherein we ſtand
in need of the counſel and the aid, the care and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of a merciful God? For though God hath bleſſed
us above any people of the World, under the happy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of a gracious Prince, who hath wiſely provided
for our peace and plenty, when all the World beſides
are toſſed up and down in miſerable circumſtances, yet
are there no juſt fears, no real dangers ſet before us, for
which it is needful to implore the mercy of a good God
to prevent the approaches of many likely enſuing trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles?
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40199:11"/>
Yes certainly, no Nation in proſperous circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
could ever offer a proſpect of more to a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mind.</p>
            <p>Who can but ſuggeſt to himſelf thoughts of danger
to the State, when he ſhall behold ſo conſiderable a part
of the people to be ſo malicious to their Rulers of every
kind, ſo ſeditiouſly diſpoſed againſt all juſt Rules of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
ſo wretchedly intractable to all Laws for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
and obedience, ſo unfaithful to all the Sacred
obligations of Oaths, and tyes of Conſcience, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
ſo univerſally immoral and vicious, that we look
like a people preparing our ſelves for our own ruine, if
God prevent it not? The Charity of your Prayers is
here ſeaſonable, if you have any deſign of doing good
to your ſelves and Country.</p>
            <p>As to the Church, the poor Church of <hi>England,</hi> the
Mirror and Miracle of the Chriſtian World, a Church
that never refuſed the exacteſt tryal from the Scriptures,
right Reaſon, and the beſt Rules of Catholiciſm from
the pureſt Antiquity; A Church that never had an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
but the man was diſtinguiſhable by ſome remarks of
ignorance, ill humor, or of driving on ſome baſe deſign;
A Church that hath always ſtood an unſhaken Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark
againſt the ſtrongeſt invaſions of her enemies of
every ſide, ſhe now needs your Prayers, and the eſpecial
protection of a merciful God. Her miſery is, that ſhe
hath a long time layn between two Mill-ſtones, but they
are now grinding her to powder, as the great Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
and Martyr forewarn'd his late Majeſty of bleſſed
Memory. She hath been hitherto hurrican'd with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
tempeſts on every ſide, but now ſhe is whirlwinded
with their combin'd blaſts; and muſt expect all the evils,
that enmity and treachery, faction and prophaneneſs can
bring upon her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:40199:12"/>
Where's your Prayers, your addreſſes for help? Are
you not rather promoting your animoſities, quarrelling
with circumſtances, picquering the Government, making
ſtories of the infirmities of your Superiours, purſuing
your baſe luſts and intereſts, when you ſhould be on
your knees, begging, and pleading, and crying for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy?
Can any think that we are in <hi>Jehoſaphats</hi> caſe, that
we know not what to do, and ſhall not our eyes be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our God, who is ſufficient to help us, if we ſeek him?
Are we with the Apoſtles in a ſinking ſhip, and ſhall
we not with them lift up our voices, and ſay, <hi>Lord, ſave
us or we periſh</hi>? Which if we ſhall daily and heartily do
in our never-ceaſing offices of Prayer to our merciful
God, and ſhall withal repent and amend our evil lives,
I doubt not, but that yet God will recover us from our
dangers, and reſtore us to our ſafety. Or to uſe the
words of the Prophet (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. with which I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude)
<hi>Though he hath hitherto torn us, he will yet heal
us; though he hath hitherto ſmitten us, he will yet bind

            <p>WE appear this day before the moſt high

to him; as for the <hi>Birth,</hi> ſo for
the <hi>Reſtauration</hi> of our gracious King.
And to recount with all joy and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
the concurrence of all thoſe mercies we then recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and now enjoy, by the incomparable bleſſing of that
happy day in both reſpects.</p>
            <p>As we celebrate it as the day of his <hi>Birth,</hi> we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that it had a remark upon it, of an <hi>Hactenus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorum
nulli</hi> (as it was the Motto of the Medals diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
upon that day by his Royal Father) that is, <hi>No Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh

Title to the three united Kingdoms, and many conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Provinces abroad, annexed to the Imperial Crown
of Great <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as we celebrate it as a day of his <hi>Reſtauration,</hi> I
may ſay it was with another, and a greater <hi>Hactenus,</hi> an
<hi>Hactenus Regum nulli,</hi> that is, <hi>No King was ever ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
and reſtored,</hi> no Nation ſo unexpectedly and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly
delivered.</p>
            <p>Heaven ſignified the mercy of his Birth with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of a Star at noon; but at the day of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40199:13"/>
he brought, as it were, the Sun it ſelf to us,
with the ſame joy as it appears to the poor <hi>Hyperboreans</hi>
after a ſix months night, or as when it hath newly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
a dark and furious ſtorm.</p>
            <p>So that if we conſider the day as the Anniverſary of
his Birth, then we commemorate the mercy of Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
us with a King, whoſe unqueſtionable Title (by
ſuch a clear Succeſſion from all that ever pretended an
intereſt before, and which no Prince in <hi>Europe</hi> can pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel)
hath removed and ſilenced all poſſible pretenſions
of diſpute; the fatal occaſion of ſhedding ſo much Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
blood through many former generations; and from
which calamity we ſhould never have been ſecured, if
the Government had ſtill ſtood upon the uncertain foot
of the late Uſurpations. A mercy big enough alone to
perpetuate a day of thankfulneſs to all generations.</p>
            <p>Or if we conſider this day with reſpect to his Majeſties
Reſtitution, then we cannot but with the greateſt joy
remember the incomparable miſeries from which the
Church and State can thence date their renowned deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.
I ſay, if we conſider the bleſſing of the day in
either reſpect, it can want no title to claim the fulleſt
manifeſtations of our thankfulneſs to God, that for thoſe
great ends, he was pelaſed <hi>to ſet his King upon his holy
Hill of Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this Pſalm was Prophetical and Typical of
Chriſt, Expoſitors do eaſily agree to it; and that the
literal ſenſe concerned <hi>David</hi> upon his peaceable reſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
in his Kingdom after all his troubles, and pen'd
on that occaſion, no doubt is offered. And that it may
be reductively applied to any other caſe, that holds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
with that of <hi>Davids,</hi> (which I think none

of God, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1.)</p>
            <p>And on that account our great Lord in his perſon paid
them all that honour and ſubmiſsion that ever had been
before their due. And what copy our Saviour ſet, his
Apoſtles exemplified in all their Practices and in all their
Doctrines: which the firſt and pureſt Ages conſtantly
followed, without the leaſt interruption of their Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
upon the greateſt provations to do the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:40199:14"/>
But beſides a Conſtitution that's general and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
with all Authorities from the <hi>Ego poſui, I have ſet,</hi>
we have here a <hi>meum Regum,</hi> a <hi>my King</hi>; a term of near
relation and propriety given eſpecially to Kings that are
advanced or reſtored to their Thrones, by methods of
eſpecial favour, or that are ſet up for remarkable inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of ſome extraordinary merciful Providence to the
World.</p>
            <p>And thus was <hi>David</hi> made a <hi>My King</hi> by the pregnant
inſtances of Gods peculiar favour to, and marvellous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
of him; as the Sacred Hiſtory of his Life may
eaſily inform us, if we had time to enumerate the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
obſervations of it.</p>
            <p>Now if any King might lay claim to a parallel Title
to that happy appellation, our gracious Soveraign may
do it: his caſe being as near a reſemblance to <hi>Davids,</hi>
in ſeveral circumſtances of his preſervation, as ever any
Prince could pretend to, as will appear in my following
Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Now when it thus happens, that God ſets a <hi>Meum Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem,</hi>
a <hi>My King</hi> over a People, they are to conſider,
that beſides all the obligations of duty from the general
Commandment, beſides all the engagements of gratitude
from the common mercies of being governed, there is a
further additional obligation upon them, that over and
above the performance of the ordinary acts of Loyalty,
may challenge a tenderer and more curious regard and
care to preſerve his Perſon, Honour, Peace, and Plenty.
And this to be done, not only when men are pleaſed and
humoured, or when no fears and jealouſies can poſſibly
be ſuggeſted, or when no complaints can be found againſt
evil Counſellors, corrupt Miniſters of State, and of the
abuſes of ſuch a Princes Court (for which if Subject
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40199:14"/>
may diſpenſe their Loyalty at pleaſure, then all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions
of the World are juſtifiable, and God hath
made his own Repreſentatives the moſt unfortunate of
Mankind) but this tender care muſt alſo be allowed
Kings, when their Subjects judge themſelves to lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any real inconveniencies of Government: which
they muſt ſtudy no otherwiſe to avoid, but by ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the mercy of a good God, and by humbling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for their own ſins, by which (as it generally falls
out) God was juſtly provoked, to lay ſuch afflictions
upon them: and not by taking a preſent revenge upon
their Princes Authority or juſt Rights, by reproaches,
baſe inſinuations, and bold affronts.</p>
            <p>And if in ſuch caſes the Conſtitution of the Nation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
tenders of a more ſolemn advice and counſel, let it
be always done with the greateſt love and tendereſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to his Honour and Safety; and not with a drawn
Sword in the one hand, and a Petition in the other, as
putting it to a Princes choice, either to fight or bargain
for his ſecurity, or meanly to ſubmit to every imperious
and unreaſonable Propoſal, ſo as to imbaſe or deſtroy his
Soveraignty; for which in the end ſuch Counſellors,
and the whole Nation with them, will find themſelves
the greateſt Loſers, and of which this Kingdom hath
had a ſad and a ſufficient inſtance, in the unworthy uſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of our late Majeſty of moſt bleſsed Memory.</p>
            <p>The ſum is, Bleſs God that you have not only a King,
but a <hi>My King,</hi> one whom he hath ſo eſpecially preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for, and miraculouſly reſtored to, you. This is the
firſt Head of Diſcourſe, the Original of all Eſtabliſhments
in Government.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond Head was a conſideration of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40199:15"/>
of the eſtabliſhed Power, that God was pleaſed to
ſet over them, and that was a King, he gave them the
bleſſing of a Monarchy, a Vicegerency of Power and
Government moſt like to God himſelf that gave it, (the
<gap reason="foreign" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the one God) and for which reaſon, with
more congruity and decency he allows the Monarch the
Credit and Honour of his own Name: <hi>I have made thee
a God to this people,</hi> ſaith the Almighty to <hi>Moſes</hi>: And
<hi>I have ſaid,</hi> that is, I have made <hi>you Gods,</hi> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 82. 6.)
A Government which God eſtabliſhed over the eſpecial
part of Mankind his Church, under Chriſt his anointed
King, as my Text propheſied, and <hi>David</hi> typified. A
Government of which the holy Scripture only gives us
an account in all its Hiſtories, and in all its directions to
rule and to obey.</p>
            <p>All other Authorities are mentioned but as Gods
Creatures, (I <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 23.) but the Monarch as himſelf,
dignifying him with his own Name and the Miniſtration
of his own Soveraign Authority, and grand inſtances of
his Providence over the World.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall advance the reaſon of this days Joy on that
account, by offering to you two great advantages of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical
Government above all others.<list>
                  <item n="1">1. It is more noble and honourable than any other
form of Dominion, and renders a Nation more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and renowned in the eye of the World. It is freſh
in our memories, that in the days of our Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
(as they called it) we were a reproach to all our
neighbouring Nations, a ſcorn and deriſion to them that
were round about us. And when our Natives walkt in
the ſtreets of Foreign Cities, (from whom before we had
the Priviledge of a kind acceptance above any People
in the World) the finger of ſcorn was lifted up againſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40199:15"/>
us; our name was <hi>Schellam,</hi> and our entertainment an
exprobration of ſuch ſhameful practices, as by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of which, the <hi>Turk</hi> might plead innocency, and
the <hi>Salvages</hi> juſtifie their Barbariſms.</item>
                  <item n="2">2. Monarchical Government, as it is more honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
ſo moſt ſafe, becauſe, like a well fixed Centre of
Power, it will terminate and combine all lines of intereſt
in one point of Authority. And it appears to be ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
an Expedient of the ſafeſt Peace, that whenſoever a
defection, or any contingency of State have laid deſigns
for a multiplication of Supremes, nothing hath ſo infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
confounded the Nations where they have happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
When Gods ancient people fell to a diviſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two Kings, ten Tribes revolting to <hi>Jeroboam</hi>; then
began that ſad Scene of troubles to that great people,
which enjoyed Halcyon days of peace, when they were
centred in one <hi>Solomon.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And we read of the vaſt Roman Empire, that when
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> had divided his Kingdoms among three,
(though his own Sons) the diviſion was occaſional of
ſuch ruinous inconveniencies, that it gradually loſt its
greatneſs, till it withered and leſsened to a name.</p>
            <p>What was the State of our ancient Heptarchy, but a
colliſion of inconſiſtent Powers, which kept the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in a continual ſtate of War, till a reſolution into
one Monarchy ended the controverſie?</p>
            <p>And laſtly, let us look a little back upon our late un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd
Confuſions, and you'l find, that the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
of them could never have inſinuated themſelves into
ſo many advantages for a War, had they not laid their
ground upon a pretended Coordination of Power in the
two Houſes with the King, or not found out two Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macies
in his Perſon, one in his Natural, another in his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40199:16"/>
Politick capacity, pretending to fight for the one, where
they actually purſued the deſtruction of the other.</p>
            <p>Now if any Republican ſhould murmur, object, and
ſay, That ſome Cities and Societies of Merchants have
not only ſubſiſted, but flouriſhed under popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments.
I anſwer, that ſuch Societies have always
been moſt ſafe, when they have kept up the neareſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblances
to Monarchy among themſelves; and that
great State that pretends leaſt to it, may in time be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
neceſſitated to chuſe a Monarch of their own, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him whom they at firſt threw off, or ſhrowd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
under the Protection of ſome other, or be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up by one that can controul their Greatneſs.</p>
            <p>Now bleſs God for the mercy of this Day, that made
us Subjects of this happy Government; and that he hath
put the Nation under the ſafe Authority of a fixed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
who juſt before ſtood wavering upon the points
of contending Swords for its Protection: and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
hurried up and down by the violence of every
tempeſt of War, that came from the ſeveral Quarters of
different Intereſts. In thoſe days our Governors were
all along they, that wore the longeſt Sword, and were
the preſent moſt ſucceſsful Invaders, and every he, that
had moſt ſtrength to bind our hands, rifle our Liberties,
and deſpoil our Proprieties. That had it not been for
the kind Theocracy of a gracious God, who ſhewed us
Mercy in the midſt of Judgment, to keep us together
by a moſt wiſe and unaccountable Providence, the whole
Nation had ſeveral times run into one great riot of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
every man had invaded every man with the moſt
horrid acts of cruelty and ſavagery.</p>
            <p>Therefore rejoyce, O <hi>Britain,</hi> that the Power that is
now ſet over thee, is not any new Model of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40199:16"/>
no new Set of Militeers, no Table full of a packt
Company that eat and govern in the ſame poſture; but
a gracious Monarch, a King, who came to deliver thee
out of the hands of thy Oppreſſors, the nerves of whoſe
loyns ſhould ſtrengthen and uphold thee, not whoſe
weight ſhould cruſh and oppreſs thee: whoſe Scepter
might become a Croſier to thee, whoſe Crown a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and whoſe Throne a Mercy-ſeat.</p>
            <p>And thus I have diſcharged my ſelf of the ſecond
Head of my Diſcourſe, and accent of thankfulneſs, and</p>
            <p n="3">3. I come to the third, the Extent of the Monarchs
Government, it is <hi>upon Gods holy Hill of Sion,</hi> that is,
over the Affairs that concerned Religion, as well as thoſe
that reſpected the Civil Welfare of his Subjects. Thus
<hi>Moſes</hi> had the diſpoſal of both the Trumpets to convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
Aſsemblies both of Eccleſiaſtick and Temporal
concernment. <hi>Joaſh</hi> had the Teſtimony put into his
hand, as well as the Crown ſet upon his head (2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
23. 11.) And as our Saviour, when he came to eſtabliſh
his Religion, made no alteration (no not in the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance)
of that practice in his Life or Doctrine; ſo that
Power over Eccleſiaſtick Affairs and perſons, was allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and continued to all the Roman Emperours as ſoon
as they aſſumed the Chriſtian Profeſſion (as <hi>Socrates</hi> the
Hiſtorian affirms.) And S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> aſſures us, that the
Power of Kings extended not only to thoſe things (<hi>quae
pertinent ad humanam ſocietatem, ſed quae pertinent ad
divinam Religionem</hi>) which pertained to humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
but thoſe that concerned the divine Religion,
(<hi>Lib. 3. contra Creſconium.</hi>)</p>
            <p>But who knows not, that if a man would pretend
to an accumulation of Authorities, he might be as lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xuriant
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40199:17"/>
in the caſe of this Royal Right, as in any other
that can be named, to the ſhame of both the Roman and
Preſbyterian pretenſions.</p>
            <p>Now in this capacity of Power the Church of <hi>England</hi>
ownes and receives, ſwears and ſubmits it ſelf to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns
of theſe Nations. And it is the joy and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the day, that his Majeſty was reſtored to the
aſsumption of that Power over our <hi>Sion,</hi> as well as over
our <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But that which advanceth our joy and
gratitude is, that there never was a ſeaſon when a poor
languiſhing Church more needed the aſsiſtance and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of ſuch a Regal Authority, not only to protect, but to
deliver and reſtore her. And the mercy of her delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
will appear by theſe ſeveral inſtances of her cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
at that time.<list>
                  <item n="1">1. Rejoyce, O Daughter of <hi>Sion,</hi> for thy King, like
another <hi>Zerobabel,</hi> came after the days of a long Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
to reſtore the Houſes of God, which were either
miſerably ruined, or ſhamefully defaced, and daily aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted,
with a <hi>down with them, down with them even
to the ground,</hi> to their priſtine beauty and order: and
to repair in all places, what the enemy had done wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
in the Sanctuaries, which before had laid ſo forlorn
and deſpicably neglected, that they looked in moſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as if ſome <hi>Diocleſian</hi> or Apoſtate <hi>Julian</hi> had been
attempting the ruine of Chriſtianity it ſelf.</item>
                  <item n="2">2. God did then graciouſly ſend his King to our <hi>Sion,</hi>
to patronize the caſe of his own afflicted Order that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
to his Service, which a long time had become the
miſerable objects of popular fury: ſome of which they had
murthered, others exiled to ſeek their bread in deſolate
places, many they immured in naſty Priſons, innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
they deprived of ſupport and livelihood, abetting
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40199:17"/>
every Abject to trample upon them, to ruffle and bait
them with the moſt ignominious uſages. But then came
the Meſſenger of God our gracious King, to bring the
glad tidings of their reſtitution to their Places and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Protection and Revenues, which the men in ſheeps
clothing had devoured and rob'd from God, that their
perſons might be cheap, and their offices contemptible.</item>
                  <item n="3">3. God at that time ſeaſonably ſent his King to repair
the breaches of our <hi>Sions</hi> Unity, which ſhe had ſo loſt,
that ſhe then exceeded all parallels of confuſion. Here
was <hi>Ephraim</hi> againſt <hi>Manaſſe,</hi> and <hi>Manaſſe</hi> againſt <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim,</hi>
and both againſt <hi>Judah</hi> (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 21.) Here was
I of <hi>Paul,</hi> I of <hi>Apollos,</hi> and I of <hi>Cephas,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12.)
That the Church became like the <hi>Epheſian</hi> Tumult, ſome
were crying one thing, ſome another, till all our Aſsem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
were confounded (<hi>Act.</hi> 19. 32.) But to compleat
our <hi>Sions</hi> miſery, ſhe was not only broken in pieces, but
every divided Party was always diſſolving into leſſer
ſubdiviſions. The univerſal Fate of all Schiſmatical ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations,
as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> particularly obſerves of the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi>
that they were (<hi>in minutiſſimas partes conciſi</hi>)
minced into the ſmalleſt particles of Faction.</item>
                  <item n="4">Laſtly, God ſent our King ſeaſonably then to <hi>Sion,</hi>
to reſtore that faith to us, which we profeſs to have been
that, which was once delivered to the Saints, and that
dares only ſtand the tryal of all the acknowledged Rules
of Catholiciſm. Which at the time of his Majeſties
Reſtauration, was ſo confounded with all the erroneous
Doctrines that ever before had born the name of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
that had <hi>Quod vult Deus</hi> lived at that time, he might
have ſpared S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> large enumeration, by having
them all (and more) in his view, at one proſpect. The
good old way, and all the ancient paths of Truth, were
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40199:18"/>
now grown up and laid common, and ſo many falſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors
were kindled up in every corner, that the poor
people ſtood at a gaze what way to take, what light to
follow.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe be ſeveral inſtances of our <hi>Sions</hi> calamity and
deliverance, and the reaſons of her preſent thankfulneſs.
But now if any ungrateful perſon ſhould go about to
leſſen our Joy, and reclaim and ſay, That the Expedient
hath not throughly attained its end; yet he muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
that God gave it as ſufficient to do its full work,
and it certainly had done it, if our demerit of ſuch a
mercy had not been too great, and our improvement of
it too little.</p>
            <p>And though becauſe the obſtinate <hi>Samaritans</hi> did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
the work, becauſe they might not build with us
after their own faſhion, and by falſe accuſation obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
the full completion of the building, ſo that the old
men began to cry and murmur, that it fell ſhort of the
ſplendour of the former; yet as it is, there is no good
man but may ſee enough, and enjoy enough, as grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to acknowledge the mercy of the deliverance, and
the bleſſing of Gods ſetting his King our Soveraign <hi>upon
his holy Hill of Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I am acquitted of the third Head of my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
the Extent of Regal Government, and ſo I am
ingaged in the</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourth and laſt, which is the conſideration of
the greatneſs of the mercy of <hi>Davids</hi> reſettlement, from
the grand difficulties of the attainment, <hi>Yet have I ſet,</hi>
that is, in deſpite of the greateſt oppoſition and the
ſtrongeſt improbabilities. For though the Heathen fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
raged, and the people imagined a vain thing,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40199:18"/>
though the Kings and Rulers of the Earth oppoſed him
with their power and counſel, that is, though his Son
<hi>Abſolom</hi> and a conſiderable part of his Kingdom made a
defection from him at home, and the <hi>Moabites,</hi> King of
<hi>Zabah,</hi> the <hi>Syrians</hi> of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> the <hi>Amalekites</hi> and
<hi>Ammonites</hi> ſometimes oppoſed him abroad (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.)
yet in contradiction to all theſe difficulties, and after all
theſe dangers did God <hi>ſet him upon his holy Hill of
Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was <hi>Davids</hi> Yet, and can we not celebrate as
great an one for our gracious <hi>Charles</hi>? Yet certainly,
and by far every way a greater; God brought him to
his Throne through ſeverer difficulties, ſtronger oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and upon far leſſer hopes and probabilities. Who
could believe that power leſs able to prevent the admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Son, that was ſtrong enough to bring ſo great
and ſo good a Monarch, as his Royal Father, to the
Scaffold? Or can we think that thoſe men ſhould ever
indulge the ſafety of the Branch, that had confidence
and malice enough to deſtroy ſuch a Body and Stock of
Royalty? But we may meaſure the difficulties and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles
of his Majeſties Reſtauration by theſe particular
Rules of Obſervation.<list>
                  <item n="1">1. God reſtored him when the poor deluded Vulgar
had been unweariedly taught, that the War commenced
againſt his Royal Father and his Houſe, was to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<hi>The Cauſe of God,</hi> and that the Maſters of the
Plot (the better to ſecure their deſign) had wrought a
great part of the people to a belief, that there lay all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
upon their Conſciences, to deſtroy every thing
and perſon that ſtood a defence to his late Majeſty and
his Family. And we all know, that thoſe men will be
hardly perſwaded to change their mind, that have once
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40199:19"/>
made it their Religion to continue in their opinion. And
whoſe life can be ſafe againſt him, who can think he
does God good ſervice to murther him?</item>
                  <item n="2">2. God reſtored him after his Enemies had had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
time (twelve years from the day of his Right)
to ſettle themſelves in their Uſurpations, by trying all
kinds and modes of Parliamenting, and by experiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all Models of governing, and accomodating all their
Tyrannies with ſuch ſoftning names, as might beſt court
the people into an acceptance of them. And ſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they were Keepers of their Liberty, at another time
they were a Committee of Safety, and at laſt it was a
Protectorſhip of their Priviledges. But in the mean time
the poor baniſhed King was to be believed, firſt an
Alien, and then an Enemy to their concerns; and by all
poſſible Arts of Malice to be made odious and unacce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable
to the Nation.</item>
                  <item n="3">3. God then reſtored him, when he had never a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Prince or State effectually to eſpouſe his Intereſt.
And when the Uſurpers were grown ſo conſiderable, as
to be courted and addreſſed to, by ſeveral neighbouring
Princes: among which, if any one was ſuſpected to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
his exiled Majeſty any aid or favour, they found
other Princes as conſiderable, to balance him againſt all
attempts of ſuccour, though it were in contradiction to
the Nations publick intereſt, and its common ſafety: ſo
that it might be then ſaid of his Majeſty as his Example
<hi>David</hi> ſaid of himſelf, that his very acquaintance were
afraid of him, and conveighed themſelves from him, and
that no man cared for his Soul.</item>
                  <item n="4">4. Fourthly and laſtly, God then reſtored him, when
he was at the loweſt hopes and expectations of any relief
or help from his Loyal Friends at home. They had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40199:19"/>
to the laſt ſhift for his deliverance. They
had moved every ſtone, and turned all poſſibilities, but
their endeavours had been always baffled, and at laſt ſo
perfectly defeated, that their perſons were expoſed to
the watchful malice of their implacable enemies, to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
baniſh, or impriſon them as they pleaſed. And
their Fortunes either ſo altogether ruined, or miſerably
haraſſed, that whereas before thoſe Loyal Souls had
furniſhed his Majeſty with conſiderable ſums for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
they were now ſo diſabled and deſperately diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
that they either could not, or durſt not afford
him a ſufficiency for his ordinary ſupport.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe were the difficulties and obſtacles of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
happy Reſtauration, than which in the proſpect of
humane judgment, none could be imagined more obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
or inſuperable, or render his condition more hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
and deſperate. But then God took the matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his own hand, and himſelf (as he had done for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
before) ſent down from on high to fetch him home
(<hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 16) He divided the waters of ſtrife on the
one hand and on the other, to make way for his paſſage,
and proclaimed to the World (to his own Honour and
our Joy) that in defiance to all his Enemies power and
greatneſs, malice and contrivements at home, in deſpite
of all the compliances of his falſe friends abroad, and
notwithſtanding all the incapacities and deſpondencies
of them that loved him here at home, <hi>Yet have I ſet my
King, my Charles, upon my holy Hill of Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus diſcourſed what conqueſt God made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the obſtacles and difficulties of his Majeſties Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and how he helped his Anointed with the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
ſtrength of his own right hand (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 20.) as we
muſt firſt give to God the honour due to his own great
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40199:20"/>
Name, ſo alſo let us oblige our ſelves to the ſtricteſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to his Majeſties preſervation and ſafety, leſt we
defame our preſent profeſſion of Gods eſpecial favour to
him, by expoſing him to the ſame difficulties to preſerve
his Throne, that he met with to attain it.</p>
            <p>Hath God given him to us by the complicated Right
of his Birth and Reſtauration, and ſhall not we preſerve
him now we have him by the tendereſt Love and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
we can poſſibly expreſs? Can any ingratitude be
ſo great, any diſloyalty ſo enormous, as ſo to confront
ſuch a great mercy of God, as muſt ſeem to reproach the
very inſtances of its execution for his preſervation? Did
God bring him home from an Exile, and ſhall we abet
thoſe perſons and their contrivements, that tend directly
to the carrying him back to the ſame unhappy ſtate?
Did God allow him an Oak to cover him, and ſhall we
turn it into a Croſs to crucifie him? Were men of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
perſwaſion made inſtrumental to his ſafety, and
ſhall we that are of the ſame Communion with him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
it by our bold ſeparations and unſatiable deſires
of change?</p>
            <p>Eſpecially let us guard his Throne with the Militia of
our devouteſt Prayers, whoſe keen earneſtneſs may
wound his Enemies in the fifth rib every day. Let us
pray that a Colony of Angels may garriſon his habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and a Wall of his Subjects Love, Faith, and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
ſecure his Sacred Perſon from every Invaſion upon
his Peace or Honour.</p>
            <p>O let us beg for the longeſt thred of time that morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
is capable of, that may not only carry him to an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
old age, but may lengthen out his life to ſuch an
unuſual duration, that it may pay us back again the
many years his Exile loſt us. But above all, let us be
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40199:20"/>
ſure to ſecure his Throne with vertuous and religious
lives. There is a kind of Treaſon in ſin: upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of which it was once threatned, that ye ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
ye and your King. And <hi>Ezra</hi> penitently acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to God, <hi>That for our iniquities we and our King
and Prieſts have been delivered up, &amp;c.</hi> (<hi>Ezr.</hi> 8.) O let
therefore the vertuous and exemplary lives of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Friends cloath his Enemies with ſhame, baffle all
their Pretenſions to better Manners, and perfectly ſilence
their (for the moſt part unjuſt) declamations againſt the
irregularities of the Loyal; that ſo every good Subject
may think and teſtifie, that it is not enough to proclaim
and ſay, but alſo to live</p>
