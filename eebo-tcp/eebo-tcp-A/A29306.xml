            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Mpedocles</hi> of <hi>Agrigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> being demanded why twas ſo hard to finde out a wiſe man, gave this reaſon; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (ſaid he) none can finde one out, who is not ſo himſelfe; therby inferring, that unleſſe there bee a proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the object and the power, it will never bee able to produce the effects flowing from it.</p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this ground it may be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that t'is impoſsible for any to give a true deſcription of Eternity, who hath no ſubſiſtance but in time; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely, although ſome ſpirits ſublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:48400:3"/>
by the dayly contemplation of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall things; may perhaps bee able to ſhew us ſome imperfect Ideas, of thoſe perfect beauties whereon they are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured, yet t'is a meere extravagance in mee who have imployed the beſt part of my time in queſt of tranſitory and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding things, to undertake the handling of a ſubject which cannot bee worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed by leſse then an Angell, nor be conceived in this life by human kind.</p>
            <p>Whileſt <hi>Hannibal</hi> was with the King <hi>Antiochus</hi> in Epheſus, where they were buſied in making preparation for a war againſt the Romans, he was invited by ſome of the great Kings favourites to heare one <hi>Phormio</hi> a Philoſopher read a Lecture of military diſcipline, and the duty of a Generall, and having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb facs="tcp:48400:3"/>
it with the applauſe of all the auditory, <hi>HANNIBALL</hi> being deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his opinion of the man, anſwered that he had indeed formerly ſeen divers mad men, but never any one ſo mad as <hi>PHORMIO,</hi> who having, never viewed troopes on their march, never ſpent one night in the trenches, or performed the leaſt duty of a Souldier, would notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding take upon himſelfe to order an Army &amp; preſcribe rules unto a General.</p>
            <p>It is certainly much eaſier to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all millitary knowledge which is contained in the finite number of ſome precepts drawne from reaſon and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; then fathom the bottemleſs Abyſs of Eternity, which holds no proportion at all with the narrow limits and ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſſe of humane reaſon, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb facs="tcp:48400:4"/>
to undertake the handling of this ſubject is a much greater madneſſe then that of <hi>PHORMIO.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being ſo, I doubt not but there will be ſome, who unſatisfied with what I ſhall ſet down, will queſtion upon what grounds I have adventured to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh my conceptions upon Eternity, ſo many excellent pennes having alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy imploied themſelves in the deciphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of it) and will conclude, that as his errour is to bee pittied, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his expectation, (failes) by the weakeneſse of his forces to performe what hee hath undertaken; ſo his madneſſe is unexcuſable, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes what himſelfe knowes, is not to bee performed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> will not goe about to juſtifie my ſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:48400:4"/>
againſt their reprehenſions, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have truth for their foundation; all <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſay is, <hi>I</hi> have written this onely for my owne private uſe, that <hi>I</hi> might at times of leiſure view the diſcoveries <hi>I</hi> have made of that Countrey to which <hi>I</hi> tend; and on which time at the ſhutting in of my lives courſe will land me, and <hi>I</hi> have publiſhed it not as conceiving <hi>I</hi> could better what hath formerly been written, but out of an opinion, that my conceits (though ſhort of what others have delivered) might hit the humor of ſome one or other, and waken him from that lethargie wherein the World holds the most part of men during their lives, that he might look about in time and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide himſelfe for that Eternall habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; thoſe who are ſtung with the Taran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tula,
<pb facs="tcp:48400:5"/>
cannot be cured but by Muſick, and <hi>I</hi> have heard that t'is not alwayes the beſt Tunes help the diſeaſed Patients, but ſuch as (how extravagant ſoever) ſimpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize moſt with their inclinations.</p>
            <p>Reader! having given thee this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my ſelfe, <hi>I</hi> proceed briefly to ſet down the ſubſtance of this ſhort Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe: in the firſt place, <hi>I</hi> ſhall endeavour to let thee know what Eternity is; in the ſecond, to deſcribe what our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will bee in it: &amp; in the laſt place, to ſet down ſuch Rules as may (being obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) render us perfectly happy in that fixed condition, wherein Eternity will place us: all <hi>I</hi> require from thee is, that if thou approve not what I write, thou wilt (at leaſt) approve the good will wherwith tis written.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ne of the Maximes wherein Philoſophers (notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the many different o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions among them) doe accord is this; <hi>Nihil eſt in intellectu, quod non prius fuit in ſenſu</hi>; that is, nothing is in our underſtanding which hath not firſt gained it's admittance through the ſenſes; our ſoules during the time of their impriſonment in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ſeeme to bee ſo narrowly coopt up by our ſenſes who guard all the avenues, by which any intelligence of the great workmanſhips of nature may be convai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, that they get notice of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſave what is brought them by their mediation.</p>
            <p>Well may the exterior objects aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Sunns light fill the aire with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48400:6"/>
the repreſentation of their ſeveverall ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, but the underſtanding will not bee able to know any thing either of the ſhape or colour, unleſſe they paſs through the eye into the common ſenſe, and bee tranſmitted to the fancy.</p>
            <p>The warbling Choriſters of the aire, may wel cauſe both the woods &amp; vallies, eccho, with their melodious ſoundes; and all the famous Orators diſplay the utmoſt charmes of winning Rhetoricke: but if our eares deny them entrance to the braine, they will at laſt die in the aire where they were formed, without giving us the laſt information, either of their harmony, or meaning.</p>
            <p>All the rare ſpices of the Eaſt may well evaporate themſelves to nothing before our eyes, without leaving any other ſenſe of their rich perfumes, but what our ſmelling ſhall convey unto us. And if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Monarck farr ſurpaſſing <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> in the richeſſe, and extent of his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhould unpeople the three Elements, to furniſh out a ſumptuous feaſt that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48400:6"/>
might ſhew forth the greatneſſe of his magnificence, wee were not able to diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inguiſh any of thoſe exquiſite dainties, and delicious wines, farther then what our taſts ſhould dictate unto us.</p>
            <p>Infine our Soules, notwithſtanding their immateriall ſubſtance, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of will and underſtanding, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they thinke themſelves equall to the Celeſtiall Spirits (were but thoſe gates dammed up whereof our ſenſes are the Porters) would (like the Aegyptians du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the three daies darkeneſſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God plagued them) bee forced to ſit ſtil, nor could the Heavenly gifts of reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and reſolving availe them ought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the diſcovery of truth or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which are the onely object of their functions.</p>
            <p>The ſpotts wee now diſcover in the Sunn, the vallies in the Moon, and Starrs that moove in an Epicycle about the Planet <hi>Jupiter</hi>; had been Eternally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from all man-kinde, had not the invention of <hi>Galileus</hi> perſpectives by ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48400:7"/>
the weakneſſe of our ſight, diſcovered them unto our eyes and I am verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that all thoſe rare effects of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which wee now attribute to ſimpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, to antipathy, or other occult cauſes, are indeed onely materiall quallities, but too ſubtile to bee perceived by our ſenſes, which is the cauſe that all our rareſt wits are at a fault in queſt of them, and pay us onely with obſcure termes inſtead of truth.</p>
            <p>Eternity alone is that can never fall to bee the object of our ſenſes; the infinity of it's duration cannot be comprehended by their finite powers, and time doth hurrie us away ſo faſt over the race of our mortallity, that we have not the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to contemplate its ſtable firmneſſe, not ſubject to thoſe lawes of ruine by which Heaven and earth ſhall one day periſh. This truth is excellently confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med unto us by the Apoſtle, when hee ſaith that neither eye hath ſeene, eare heard, nor hath it entred into the heart of man, to conceive the excellencies of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48400:7"/>
what God hath prepared in ſtore for thoſe that feare him. Eternity is ſurely one of the moſt precious of all thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and the Triſagion or thrice holy, ſo much renowned in the Greeke Church, as a Hymne delivered to them by the mouthes of Angells, <hi>Sanctus Deus, ſanctus fortis, Sanctis immortalis,</hi> puts immortallity in the laſt place, as complement of the Divine perfections.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Moſes</hi> mooved with a holy curioſity, deſired hee might behold the face of God, he was anſwered it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to ſee that and live; all this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Patriarch could obtaine, was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to view the glory of his hinder parts in paſſing by; and what is thereby meant ſave onely this; that wee may be permitted here on Earth, to contemplate the Divine perfections in the Creatures, which are the leaſt, and meaneſt effects of his power, being produced during the continuance of fleeting time, but that all ſollid joyes, together with his beatificall viſion, are reſerved onely for ſuch as fix
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48400:8"/>
their habitations in the bleſt dwelling of Eternity.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> being through ſpeciall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour wrapt into the third Heaven that hee might take a taſt of thoſe Celeſtiall pleaſures, thinkes it not lawfull to utter the <hi>Arcana,</hi> that is, the ſublime, and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den things which hee learned there; the greateſt height we can attaine unto whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt wee are heere, is to contemplate the myſteries which ſhall be there revealed, <hi>per ſpeculum in aenigmate,</hi> through a glaſs, in a darke riddle: what is this glaſſe, but faith, by whoſe aſſiſtance our faint eyes are able without dazeling, to looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sunn of truth, even God himſelfe, and expound thoſe riddles that paſſe the reach of humane underſtanding?</p>
            <p>Relying therefore upon this guide, I ſhall begin to ſearch into the Nature of Eternity, becauſe her Maxims, are like a clew of thread let downe from Heaven to lead us with ſecurity, and humbleneſſe into the underſtanding of Divine myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; that ſo wee may not ſtray in the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48400:8"/>
wild maze of ſelfe opinion, wherein the greateſt part of humane kinde do wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der endleſly, and loſe themſelves, at laſt being intrapped in the pernicious ſnares, of overweaning pride, or ſtupid ignorance.</p>
            <p>When the Divines endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Deity unto us, they make us of three ſorts of Attributes: the firſt, as they call them negative, the ſecond rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and the third poſitive: the firſt, ſhew what hee is not, and the ſecond what hee is in relation to us, or to ſome other being, but the third which ſhould declare unto us, what hee is in himſelfe, faile to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it, becauſe all tearmes Explicate onely our conceptions, and wee can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nothing but what is infinitely ſhort of his perfections: they call him increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and immortall, that wee may know his eſſence is incompatible, with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hath either ending or beginning; they terme him Creator and Redeemer,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48400:9"/>
thereby informing us that all the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings we enjoy here or expect heereafter are but dependancies upon his power. But when they tell us of his vertues, and of his wiſdome, they intend not that we ſhould thereby underſtand ſuch vertues or ſuch wiſdome as are in us; not an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or habit of his will inclining him to purſue alwayes the dictates of a right reaſon, nor a perſpicacity of judgement enabling him to diſtinguiſh upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions the reall truths, from thoſe that ſeeme ſo; which notwithſtanding is the proper meaning of thoſe tearmes, whereas the Divine vertues, and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome are neither qualities, nor habits, but the very eſſence and being of God himſelfe, which cannot bee knowne or comprehended by any other nature infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to him.</p>
            <p>It being therefore admitted that wee can never write or conceive any thing worthily of the Divine Nature, how is it poſſible, I ſhould bee able to explicate the Nature of Eternity, which is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48400:9"/>
of his duration, and one of the moſt excellent of all his attributes? God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſeemes to glory in it when being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked his name by the great Patriarch <hi>Moſes</hi> he gives him only this deſcription of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>Ego ſum qui ſum.</hi> I am he that am, without mentioning either his power, his juſtice, or any of his other attributes, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us thereby to underſtand that all his other attributes depend upon his being (according to the order of our concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) as their foundation; that other things have an exiſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce whoſe beginning flowes from his power, and whoſe continuance is an effect only of his wil; that nothing hath a ſtable independant being ſave onely he, and that in fine, no happineſſe or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is to bee priſed, if the enjoyment of it be not ſecured unto us by Eternity.</p>
            <p>This meaſure of Gods being, cannot (by any poſitive terms which wee can uſe) bee comprehended, or defined, nor can it bee illuſtrated to humane under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, by other meanes then by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the nature of it negatively, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48400:10"/>
comparatively, unto thoſe things which have a being during the continuance of time, the firſt of which conſiderations ſhall be of the infinity thereof; which (as I ſaid before) is a terme purely negative, and repreſents nothing at all unto our i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations, the only conception we can frame upon it; being of ſomething, not circumſcribed by ends, or bounds, as are all the objects which preſent themſelves unto our ſenſes.</p>
            <p>We are aſtoniſhed when we conſider the vaſt extent of this habitable earth which hath ſufficed to the production and nouriſhment of the innumerable number of men now living, or that have had a being ſince the Creation of the World, and we are notwithſtanding ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied both by the demonſtrations of Coſmographers, and relations of Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, that a ful third part of it is yet undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. The immence quantity of waters in the Ocean, ſeemes to poſe Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke, to number all the ſeverall drops of water contained in it: but above all the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48400:10"/>
Heavens incircling round this ball made up of Earth, Water, and the other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and exceeding it ſo far in bigneſſe, that all of it together beares in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to them but ſuch proportion (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Aſtronomers computation) as a point in midle of a circle, to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, doth with its unmeaſurable greatneſſe out vie the force of humane underſtanding, to conceave any <hi>idea</hi> of its dimenſions; and yet when wee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but with the leaſt attention theſe great workemanſhips of God, and ſearch into the nature of them, wee muſt needs be ſatisfied they are not infinite; for that conſiſting (as our ſenſes can informe us) of finite parts; themſelves muſt likewiſe bee of the ſame nature with the parts whereof they are compoſed: who is it that perceives not when hee takes up a ſhovell full of earth from the ground, or but a diſh of water out of the Sea, that thoſe portions of the two Elements are finite, and that our not being able to find out their certaine quantity, proceeds not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48400:11"/>
from any contradiction in their natures, to bee ſurveyd or meaſured, but onely from the weakneſſe of our forces? who is it that can doubt when hee perceives the Sunne draw neerer to us but that the diſtance betweene us and him is finite? ſince were it otherwiſe, it were not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of increaſe or diminution. And who in fine can make a queſtion but that the Heavens are circumſcribed by certaine bounds, and limits, when hee beholds them to bee perpetually meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Sunn, Moone, and the other Planets in their ſeverall motions, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to whoſe different races, wee give beginning and ending, unto our houres, dayes, months, years, and to our ages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Archimedes</hi> was of opinion hee could have mooved the world, had there been any other place out of it, upon which he might have fixed his inſtrument; and I am certainly perſwaded that when wee ſhall bee freed out of this cage of earth wherein our ſoules are incloſed during this life; wee ſhall with eaſe bee able to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48400:11"/>
ſurveigh and comprehend, the Heavens, the Earth, and all the other workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of nature that now appeare to bee ſo far beyond the reach of humane un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. And yet when our inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſoules ſhall have the power to circle earth, ſound hell, and meaſure all the vaſt extent of Heaven, how little or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nothing at all will that appeare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compared unto infinity? if wee were able to number all the droppes of water in the Sea, and count the ſands upon the ſhore, and if for every one of them wee were to live an age before wee died, yet were this terme as nothing being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared unto Eternity, ſince time would at laſt conſume all that large ſtocke of our ſubſiſtance, and Eternity when that were paſt would ſtill continue conſtant in the full poſſeſſion of all its being.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was of opinion the world wherein wee live had no beginning, and ſhould never have an ending, perſwaded thereunto by the inceſſant viciſſitude of generation, and corruption, and the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48400:12"/>
courſe of Nature which perpetuates all the ſeverall ſpecies, or kinds of things, notwithſtanding the continuall decay of the individualls, whereof they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; if this imagination of his were true, it would then follow, that the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the world, ſhould bee indeed perpetuall, but not infinite, and that it would have nothing in it approaching to the pure ſimplicity of an Eternall being. For if time be divided (as reaſon, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the opinion of all Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, aſſure us tis) into paſt, preſent, and to come, how can that (though nere ſo farr extended) bee without end? whoſe very being conſiſts in a perpetuall fluxe of ending and beginning; or how can that bee without bounds? whoſe two parts, that is, the firſt and laſt, are not at all; and whoſe third part (wherein one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it ſubſiſts) is circumſcribed within ſuch narrow limits, that we can hardly think a thought, during the terme of its durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and what reſemblance can there bee in it of Eternity; the one being in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48400:12"/>
motion, and the other in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant quiet; the one perpetually changing, and the other never ſubject to alteration, and the one in fine ſubſiſting onely in the ſhort inſtants of the preſent time, whereas the other comprehends all times paſt, preſent, and to come, in the pure ſimplicity of a preſent being. From this ground, there ariſeth another conſideration of the Nature of Eternity, that is of the indiviſibility thereof, which I make the ſubject of my next reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Indiviſibility is a terme alſo negative, which repreſents unto us onely ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that cannot bee parcelled out by portions as the things of this inferiour world way bee. <hi>Divide, et impera,</hi> that is divide and governe, is a maxime ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully practiſed by the Politicians, when making uſe of the private diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions either of a City, or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, they obtaine and preſerve there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their Dominion over all the differing parties: and we may alſo, with the ſame

                  </gap>,</hi> divide and deſtroy; God who is Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of whatſoever hath an exiſtence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe one by the ſimplicity of his Nature, hath placed the ſubſiſtence of all things in unity, and hath therefore by a working peculiar onely to himſelfe, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the contraries of heat and cold, of draught and moiſture, unto the making up of all the ſeverall bodies, either ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or inſenſible, which are contained in the rich treaſury of nature; whileſt they continue united by this bond, ſo long they are ſaid to bee; but if the union bee once broken, either by externall violence, or the inward working of the different qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities whereof the body is compoſed; then doth it forthwith loſe the former being, and becomes ſome other thing, according to the nature of the new form which it acquires. As long as our bodies remaine fit to entertaine our ſoules, by the due temperature of the humors, and diſpoſition of the Organs to receive her operations, wee continue to bee men;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48400:13"/>
but when that ceaſeth either by inward diſtemper or outward force, wee then leave to be ſo, our ſoules becomming ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated formes, and our bodies retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the common maſſe of matter, from whence they are extracted; the ſame wee ſee happens in beaſts, plants, and in all other inanimate bodies, of what Nature or quality ſoever: ſo as there can bee no concluſion truer then this, that whatſoever is allready divided, hath left to bee what it was formerly, whatſoever may bee divided is ſubject to decay and ruine; and whatſoever is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible, muſt alſo of neceſſity by reaſon of the ſimplicity of its Nature bee Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</p>
            <p>Eternity is therefore indiviſible, and all thoſe happy perſons who have gained that bleſſed part, are allwaies in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their whole being, they loſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what is paſt, they want nothing of what is future, but the preſent in that Celeſtiall Countrey doth comprehend after an unexpreſſible manner, all thoſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48400:14"/>
three different, and incompatible parts, into which time is divided. And hence it is, that all the happineſſe found there, is true, and ſolid; becauſe thoſe different goods are united in that fixed Manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which being heere divided, miſlead the greateſt part of humane kinde in the ſearch they make after the chiefeſt good, and feed us onely with appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces inſtead of truth.</p>
            <p>Good is the ſimpleſt of all other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and is therefore not to bee looked for heere, where nothing doth ſubſiſt but is compounded; and all thoſe things which are ſo eagerly purſued by men, for the reſemblance they have to good, are but like glowormes, which cheat us as wee wander in the night, and caſting forth a luſtre equall to that of the moſt precious Gemmes, are in themſelves naught elſe but rottenneſs &amp; putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>Some hunt after power and ſoveraign command, expecting to find true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in Authority; but alas! how infinitely are they miſguided by ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? the cares of governing, and dangers that accompany a Scepter, ſo farr out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waigh the happineſſe found in it, that <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> who enjoyed the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the world, in the moſt ſetled times it ever ſaw, made it his dayly ſuite unto the Senate, that he might bee reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto the quiet of a private life: and <hi>Diocletian</hi> having generouſly caſt off the yoake of ruling others, refuſed to returne againe unto the glorious ſervitude, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing that hee found more pleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Cabages growing in his ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry garden, then twenty yeares command over the Roman Empire had yielded to him.</p>
            <p>Others there are, whoſe thoughts are
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48400:15"/>
wholly taken up in gathering wealth, as if that were the onely thing to bee deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, never conſidering (ſo groſly are they blinded by their covetouſneſſe) that the content of riches conſiſts not in the hoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up of treaſures, but in the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall diſtribution of them; that the ſordid wayes of gathering money, renders them odious to others, and the reſtleſſe care of keeping it, deſtroyes the quiet they would eſtabliſh in themſelves; that their continuall negotiation about gaine, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them from enjoying the happineſſe of life; and that in fine, when they have reaped the plentiful harveſt of al their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, they muſt reſigne it unto others, who longing to enjoy the pretious ſpoile, thinke their lives tedious, and their deaths welcome. I forbeare to mention the infinite number of miſchiefes which the poſſeſſion of riches hath brought upon the owners: how many are there who (like <hi>Seneca</hi>) have in hoording up trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures beene carefull to get together the inſtruments of their owne ruine? finding

at laſt by experience, that to be the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their deaths, wherein they had eſtabliſhed the contentment of their lives: this is a truth ſo evidently cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that not Philoſophers onely and votaries, have beene able to diſcover the impoſture of them, but even whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have agreed upon it. The inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Balearicke Iſlands (now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Majorca,</hi> &amp; <hi>Minorca</hi>) drowned al their gold and ſilver in the Ocean; and the Spartans (one of the moſt flouriſhing Common-wealths that ever were) bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed thoſe mettalls out of the confines of their territories, forbidding the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them to all their Citizens; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incompatible with true content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Some place their happineſſe in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and ſhunning whatſoever hath the ſhew of trouble, give themſelves whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly up to ſenſuall delights; fond fooles, who blinded by their beſtiall appetites, thinke themſelves happy men in practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thoſe actions, which deprive them

of the dignity of being reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and caſt them down into the rank of beaſts; unworthy of enjoying ſoules made after the Divine likeneſſe, ſince they imploy their whole time in giving ſatisfaction to their bodies.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48400:17"/>
ſo unſavory to him, that he attempted the killing of himſelfe, and begate ſuch an averſion againſt him in the mindes of divers of his ſubjects, that they prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a poyſon for him, which cutting ſhort the courſe of all his victories, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his triumphs, together with his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſe in the grave.</p>

               <hi>Salomon</hi> received from God the gift of an incomparable wiſedome, above all the men that ever were, and with it a confluence of all thoſe bleſſings, which might raiſe humane nature unto the greateſt height of happineſſe, whereof t'is capable during this mortall life; but the inordinate love of women, to which he was addicted in his latter time, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his iſſue of the greater part of his terreſtiall kingdome, and himſelfe (as ſome doe probably conjecture) of the Eternall ioyes of heaven.</p>
            <p>Why ſhould I farther inſtance the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle puniſhments of particular voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons? tis ſo prodigious a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for man to place his chiefeſt good
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48400:18"/>
in ſenſuall luſt, that it hath drawn down fire from heaven for the conſuming of whole Cities, and water from the earth, and firmaments, which was upon the point to have extirpated mankind, all the different Elements conſpiring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge that inſufferable wrong is done to their Creator, when wee neglect his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage ingraven in our ſoules, to ſatisfie the fleſhly part of us, which is nothing elſe but duſt and aſhes.</p>
            <p>And to conclude, even <hi>Epicurus</hi> the Philoſopher, who placed the chiefeſt good of man in pleaſure, did notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding (if we believe <hi>Seneca,</hi> rather then ſome others who have ſlandered him) eſteeme, that pleaſure to conſiſt i'th gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den meane of temperance, and not in the exorbitant uſe of wine, of play, of gluttony, and women.</p>
            <p>I have exceeded in handling this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular the brevity I had propoſed unto my ſelfe, becauſe theſe are the Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, which by the glittering brightneſſe of their deceitfull light, dazle the eyes of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48400:18"/>
our unweary youth, and like ſo many wandring fires miſlead us in our ſearch for happineſſe, through the blind paths of ignorance, and folly, untill at laſt they traine us into the dangerous precipies of wickedneſſe, and infamy, from whence wee are not able (without particular aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Divine grace) to free our ſelves, for all Eternity.</p>
            <p>All other things ſo greedily graſped at by worldly men, may be reduced unto the before mentioned heads, of power, of riches, and of pleaſure, nobility, fame, and reſpect, are the attendants upon pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſufficiency, and plenty, waite upon riches, health, ſtrength, and beauty, are neceſſarily required to the compleating of our pleaſures, and therefore what falſe appearance ſoever of happineſſe, they may hold forth to our deluded mindes, they cannot poſſibly give us that true content, which is not to be found in theſe principall things, whereunto they are but acceſſories.</p>
            <p>Power, riches, pleaſure, and the reſt,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48400:19"/>
have indeed ſome reſemblance of good, but are not that which they reſemble for good; or happineſſe (being the ſame) conſiſts not in poſſeſſing many different things, but in the union of all together, whereas they are ſo farr from being one, that they are inconſiſtent with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The waight of buſineſſe, and diſtance kept by Soveraigne Princes, for maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the reverence due to their calling, permits them not the ſweet delights of pleaſure, to which the freedome of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality is requiſite, and the vaſtneſſe of their expence, in warrs, in treaties, for intelligence, and other things incident to their Authority makes them the needi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt almoſt of all other men. The wary cloſeneſſe of the rich miſer, inconſiſtent with popularity, hinders him from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing powerfull, and his daily imployment about the encreaſing of his ſtore, debarrs him from the uſe of pleaſure, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had without the expence of time, and money. The ſeriouſneſſe of great
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48400:19"/>
affaires diſturbes the quietneſſe of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and the prodigality of luxury, waſts the eſtates of thoſe that are addicted to it.</p>
            <p>In fine, which way ſoever wee turne our ſelves, to ſeeke contentment in ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of our luſtfull appetites, theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided goods which cannot dwell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one ſubject fruſtrate our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and enforce us to confeſſe with the wiſeman, that whatſoever hath a ſubſiſtence during the continuance of time, is vanity, of vanities, and naught but vanity. For if by a particular indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, of God, and Nature, theſe divided (and as I have already ſhewed) incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible bleſſings, of power, riches, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, reſpect, nobility, fame, plenty, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, health, and ſtrength, ſhould fall to bee the portion of one man; what were all theſe advantages without ſecurity in the injoyment of them, but vanity, and meere vexation of our ſpirits? and what ſecurity can this life poſſibly afford, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid the dayly apprehenſions of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of them before wee die, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty

            <p>Our bleſſed Saviour therefore adviſeth <hi>Martha</hi> not to divide her thoughts, in the ſollicitous queſt of many things, ſince what was neceſſary was onely one, And that we might not be to ſeeke, what that one, ſingle, neceſſary thing ſhould bee, himſelfe informes us in another place what t'is, when he commands us, to ſeek firſt the Kingdome of Heaven by juſt and righteous actions, which being once ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, we ſhall enjoy all other bleſſings as coeſſentiall with it.</p>
            <p>Is power the object of thy wiſhes? thou ſhalt bee there (as the Apoſtle aſſures) coheire with him, to whom all power in Heaven and Earth is given.

            <p>Having co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered the vaſt diverſity there is between Eternity &amp; time, by reaſon of the infinity of the one, &amp; the ſtrait limits wherein the other is ſhut up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; the entire firmneſſe of the one, and the minute parts whereinto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is divided, it followes that wee ſhould raiſe our thoughts unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of thoſe excellencies, which an Eternall being hath, by the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of it unto that which wee enjoy, during the ſucceſſion of time.</p>

            <p>What an uncomfortable voyage would that man have, who were bound out in queſt of ſome particular wave, i'th middeſt of the Atlanticke Ocean, how improbable that hee ſhould make diſcovery of what hee ſought for? and how impoſſible to ſettle there, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the perpetuall agitation of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

            <p>That harmeleſſe innocence which is the precious treaſure of our Childhood, is violently ſnatched from us by the heat of youth, that inconſiderately ingageth

of dulneſſe, and heavineſſe of heart, that forſaking the onely neceſſary thought and ſtudy of Eternity, give themſelves over unto the love of vanity and the purſuit of lies; <hi>filii hominum usque quo gravi corde; ut quid diligitis vanita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem et quaeritis mendacium?</hi> as who ſhould ſay, you ſons of men, how long will you permit your hearts and your affections to bee waighed downe by the inordinate ſollitude for earthly things? behold, the pleaſures which you love and court for ſatisfaction of your youth, are onely va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and thoſe more ſollid imployments you ſearch after for the entertainment of your elder yeares, are but a lie; promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing contentment, and giving nought but care, vexation, and repentance.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> could have foreſeene that all his victories, and triumphs whereby hee ſubjected unto himſelfe the Roman State.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48400:23"/>
certainly with ſo much ardour as hee did, the cutting off all thoſe, who oppoſed themſelves to the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ambitious deſignes.

            <p>The rich man in the Goſpell would not have joyed in his full barnes, and ſtore houſes ſufficient for the expence of

many yeares, had hee but knowne that hee ſhould never live to ſee the birth of the ſucceeding morne.</p>
            <p>In fine, the buſineſſe of the world would ceaſe, and we ſhould looke with horror, and averſion, upon thoſe gilded follies, and pleaſing vanities, in queſt whereof wee ſpend our lives, diſturbe the Elements, and alter the whole frame of nature, were but their maske pulled off, and wee made ſenſible of that which is confirmed unto us by the experience of all our predeceſſors; to wit, that there is nothing in this inferiour world can give a ſatisfaction to our ſoule, whoſe frame is equall unto that of the celeſtiall ſpirits; and that allthough by an exceſſe of beſtiallity, wee could ſo plunge our ſoules into the maſſe of our terreſtiall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as to ſet up our reſts upon the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of thoſe things which are the object of our ſenſes, yet age and ſickneſſe, would like unbidden gueſts, trouble the mirth of all our entertainments; and time (the abſolute commander of all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary

            <p>So that if wee examine the true cauſe of things, wee muſt conclude, that the ill conduct of our lives, and all the miſeries, vices, and diſorders, that flow from thence; are an effect of the continuall motion of time, which repreſenting unto us theſe exteriour objects, under ſeverall diſguiſes, keeps us from penetrating into the true Nature of them, and ſuggeſting to our deluded mindes vaine hopes, and feares, doth by thoſe falſe alarmes diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbe our reaſon, and brings upon us a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfullneſſe of what is paſt, a miſtake of what is preſent, and a groſſe negligence, in not providing of our ſelves for what's to come.</p>
            <p>For remedy heereof, antiquity was u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48400:25"/>
to ſet up trophies and monuments of all great, and vertuous actions, as alſo to expoſe the bodies of Malefactors who were executed, unto the publicke view on poles, or gibbets, that ſo poſterity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put in minde of what had paſt, might be invited to imitate the one, and avoid the other. King <hi>Phillip</hi> (Father of the great <hi>Alexander</hi>) gave command unto a Page of his to wake him dayly with this admonition, that hee ſhould call to minde hee was a man, fearing leſt hee might otherwiſe bee tranſported by the falſe luſtre of his greatneſſe, and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, as to miſtake (which his Sonn af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did) what himſelfe was, and forget the condition of humanity, wherein hee had beene placed by God, and Nature. And (the great Doctor of the Church) Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> thinkes it a matter of that conſequence for us to imploy our ſelves in the conſideration of what is future, that hee aſſures us confidently (by war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the ſacred Scripture) wee ſhould never ſin, did wee but carefully rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

on the laſt things that doe attend us. <hi>Memorare noviſſima tua et in aeternum non peccabis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See here the true condition of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing during the ſucceſſion of time. Let us now alter the Scene and from this theater of confuſion, and diſorder, raiſe up our thoughts unto the contemplation of Eternity. It is an inſtant alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, never decaying, whoſe infinity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all times paſt, preſent, and to come, and whoſe ſimplicity preſenting us at once with whatſoever can be good or perfect, united in their firſt cauſe, whereof (unleſſe our ſinns debar us from his ſight) the Divine Nature wee ſhall be then made glad beholders; cleares up the foggy miſts of ignorance, of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfullneſſe, and of miſtake, which hang betweene our underſtandings and the truth of things; fills all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and faculties of our ſoules with the enjoyment of their deſired objects, and doth eſtabliſh us in the ſecure poſſeſſion of our bliſſe beyond the reach of fortune,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48400:26"/>
or of time which ſhall not there have power to traverſe our contentments with the deſire of ought thats paſt, or the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of ought to come.</p>
            <p>When we have once maturely waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe ſollid truths, wee ſhall begin to loath this priſon of our bodies ſubject to the perpetuall injuries of time, and death, and ſhall cry out with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Infaelix ego homo: quis me liberabit de corpore mortis hujus</hi>? unhappy man that I am, who ſhall deliver mee from this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which belongs to death? and with the ſame Apoſtle, fixing all our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and thoughts upon Eternity, wee ſhall continually deſire to bee diſſolved that we may live with Chriſt in his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall habitation: and when wee ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſummons to diſlodge hence, brought us by age, diſeaſes, war, famine, peſtilence, or any other officer, of time, clad in the hideouſeſt dreſſe that death can weare; wee ſhall with joy prepare our ſelves unto the journey; and with the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſay, <hi>Laetatus ſum in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48400:26"/>
his quae dicta ſunt mihi, in domum domini ibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> I am rejoyced in that which hath beene ſaid unto me, we will goe into the houſe of the Lord.</p>
            <p>It ſeemes (being a man according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods owne heart) hee had well ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died the Nature of that celeſtiall manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whoſe quallities, hee doth ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenty deſcribe in the 2 following verſes. <hi>Stantes erant pedes noſtri, in atriis tuis Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, Jeruſalem quae aedificatur ut civitas, cujus participatio ejus in idipſum.</hi> Our feete were ſtanding in thy Courts Jeruſalem. Here they are running, forced to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the motion of time, but they ſhall there be fixed in an Eternal reſt, never to bee diſturbed by time, or fortune, Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem that is builded as a City, whoſe portion conſiſteth in the thing it ſelfe. All other places are but Innes, where we are entertained as paſſengers during our pilgrimage, and therfore have their buildings ſubject (as are thoſe they har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour) unto decay, and ruine, but this City being the permanent place of our
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48400:27"/>
aboade, hath its foundations laid upon the never fading baſis of Eternity. And if you aske, what is the ſtocke or trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the inhabitants in that bleſſed country? he forth with tells us that their portion conſiſteth in the thing it ſelfe; what is the thing it ſelfe? but that which is without dependance upon any other; and what is that? but hee who being to declare himſelfe unto the Patriarch <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> ſaith hee is, hee that is, even God himſelfe, in whom is comprehended the fulneſſe of all things, and without whom is nothing, but the privation of good and happineſſe</p>
            <p>Let us endeavour then ſo to comport our ſelves that wee bee not engaged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid theſe fading tranſitory things, but may bee able to ſay with the Apoſtle; our life is laid up with Chriſt in God; and let our onely trafficke, and negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be to hoord up treaſures (according to the counſell of our bleſſed Lord and Saviour) where neither ruſt, nor mothes, can come to waſt them, nor thieves,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48400:27"/>
breake in to ſteale them from us. Wee neede not be to ſeeke where that ſhould bee, ſince hee informeth us that tis in Heaven, the onely proper ſeat and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Eternity.</p>
            <p>In the precedent diſcourſe I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to deſcribe (although imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly) the Nature and condition of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, which is the true and proper habitation of our ſoules, who have no commerce with time, but onely by their union with our bodies. A bleſſed coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but ſuch a one as doth not equally agree with all conſtitutions, to ſome it is an Ocean of pleaſure, reſt, and happineſs; to others, an abiſſe of everlaſting hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, trouble, and confuſion; the reaſon of which difference, proceedes from the diverſity of thoſe ſeverall diſpoſitions and affections wee carry with us at our parting hence. For the cleare underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding whereof, it is neceſſary that wee conſider the Nature of our Soules, and examine what are thoſe things which ſubſiſt in, and together with them, after
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48400:28"/>
the diſſolution of our bodies.</p>
            <p>The Heathen Philoſophers guided on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the light of nature, did (ſome of them) believe the ſoule of man, to bee immortall, they perceived well that ſhee was capable of many operations, even in this life, without the mediation of the bodie; that ſhee gave a being within her ſelfe, unto an infinite number of thinges, abſtracted from the ſeverall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of time, place, figure, or any other property incident unto materiall things; which kinde of being becauſe it ſorted not unto the things themſelves in their owne Nature, they muſt neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from her, and they did thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr, that ſhee could not communicate ſuch a being unto them, unleſſe ſhee had an immateriall being in her ſelfe. They ſaw the act of judging, was an action purely her own, whereby ſhe produced ſeverall concluſions (which are new be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings) out of thoſe premiſes that preſent themſelves to our imaginations; and knowing the infallibility of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48400:28"/>
               <hi>ex nihilo nihil fit,</hi> that of nothing there comes nothing, they were fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied the ſoule had a being, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant from the body, ſince it was able to communicate a being unto other things, without the helpe of any Organes which depend upon her.</p>
            <p>From the aſſurance of her being, they collected alſo her immortallity; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by the ſtrict obſervation of all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cauſes, found out that nothing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever could loſe its former being, and acquire a new one (which wee terme death in living creatures) but by diviſion, and that, that ſame could happen but two wayes, <hi>viz.</hi> either by dividing the matter from the forme, or by dividing the matter within it ſelfe, they inferred thence; that ſince both theſe wayes were incompatible with the ſoule, ſhee was not capable of a reall change, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not of death (which of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers is the greateſt) not the firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that ſhee is immateriall, nor the ſecond, becauſe ſhe is a pure forme, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48400:29"/>
that all formes are by their being ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of diviſion, of increaſe, or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution, according unto theſe two Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims among them, <hi>forma non ſuſcipit majus &amp; minus,</hi> and this other <hi>in indiviſibili non fit mutatio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the ſame grounds alſo they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, that all the reſolutions, or judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and all thoſe Sciences, and Arts, whether ſpeculative, or practicke, which are in the ſoule during this life, ſhall remaine alſo in her after her ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the body; theſe being things which depend onely on her, and which are (in a kind) part of her ſelfe, ſo as without them ſhe would loſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the perfection of her being. And to conclude, becauſe they ſaw nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the workes of Nature, which did not at ſome time or other, unleſſe (t'were hindred by exteriour cauſes) at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine unto a fulneſſe, and maturity wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it was enabled to reach that end for which it was ordained, and found the reaſonable ſoule alone, which hath for
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48400:29"/>
the object of her underſtanding the truth of all naturall cauſes, and their effects, was not able at any time during this life, wherein ſhee is united with the body to comprehend the utmoſt truth may bee diſcovered in any art, or ſcience whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; they thence inferred, that ſhee was to enjoy a being after the diſſolution of the body, wherein ſhe might at freedom exerciſe the power of reaſoning, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhee is endued, and not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thoſe ſciences ſhee hath acquired heere, but alſo bee able to conceive all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truth, and knowledge whatſoever, which may bee deduced out of them, by that concatenation and dependance, which the verity of one propoſition, hath upon that of another.</p>
            <p>I have delivered theſe ſpeculations of the Philoſophers with this brevity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſetting downe the many arguments uſed by them for proofe of their aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and anſwer of the objections have beene framed in oppoſition to them (wherewith whole volumes might bee
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48400:30"/>
filled) becauſe they have beene ſince the moſt part of them confirmed unto us by the tenets of Chriſtian Religion; the truth whereof (being revealed by God himſelfe) is not to bee diſputed by man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and I have taken this ſhort view of the condition of our ſoules, onely to this intent, that in the ſequell of the enſuing Diſcourſe wee may upon theſe grounds bee able the better to diſcover, how farr the ordinary working of naturall cauſes, doth cooperate with the Divine juſtice in the reward of vertuous, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of vitious perſons.</p>
            <p>For the clear underſtanding whereof wee muſt know that all living creatures whatſoever (except man) being deſtitute of reaſon, ſuffer themſelves without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance to bee directed by the rules of Nature. (That is, the ordinary power u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by God in governing the world) which doth ſweetly guide them to the performance of thoſe actions, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of that end, whereunto they are ordained. But man (whoſe portion is a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48400:30"/>
reaſonable ſoule) aſſumes the conduct of himſelfe, and blinded by ſelfe love, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verweaning pride, forſakes the generall end of other things (which is the honour and glory of their Maker) to purſue his owne particular good and follow the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate affections of his owne corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Nature; the true cauſe of which miſtake is this that followes.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who have curiouſly ſearched into the compoſition of man, obſerve, that he may be conſidered in a triple ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, according unto every one of which hee hath a ſeverall good, that hee propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth unto himſelfe, and endeavoureth to attaine unto during this life. The firſt is, that of a living creature compoſed of a materiall body, and a forme that doth communicate unto it life and motion. The ſecond as he is indued with a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſoule, capable of Diſcourſe, and knowledge, participating thereby of the Nature of intellectuall ſpirits, which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him in a ranke above all the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall creatures of this inferior world. And
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48400:31"/>
the third, as hee is the workemanſhip of God created by him out of nothing, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his owne likeneſſe, that hee might ſerve him with obedience and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, during his temporall being, and be the witneſſe, and pertaker of his glory in Eternity. The chiefeſt good of man according to the firſt, are riches, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall pleaſures, called by the Apoſtle, <hi>Concupiſcentia carnis, &amp; oculorum</hi>; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence of the fleſh and eyes.</p>
            <p>According to the ſecond the vanity of humane knowledge accompanied with the forgetfulneſſe of God; or the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſire of obtaining Power, Honour, and command, called by the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>ſuperbia vitae,</hi> pride of life; thoſe who conſider him according to the third capacity, eſteeme their chiefeſt good to conſiſt in the uniting of their wills with God, and in procuring the advancement of his glorious Name.</p>
            <p>Now the vaſt diſtance there is be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tweene theſe ends which men propoſ<gap reason="illegible: page cropped" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

Thoſe of the firſt rank, abandoning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſenſuall luſts forget the dignity of humane Nature: and abaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the ranke of beaſts. Thoſe of the ſecond, denying to acknowledge him from whom they have received all thoſe advantages wherein they glory, i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate the Divels in their pride, ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and rebellion againſt their maker. Thoſe onely of the third ranke, entring into the true knowledge of themſelves, and of the end for which they were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſubmit their wills unto Almighty God, and endeavoring to imitate the Angells in their prompt obedience, make themſelves during this life, fit to enjoy their ſociety after the diſſolution of their bodies.</p>
            <p>From the great contrariety of mens judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, reſolutions, and of the actions and habits, that flow from, and are acquired
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48400:32"/>
by them, ariſeth the different condition of our ſoules when they are ſeperated from our bodies. The Corall we ſee dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, growes in the Sea, and I have read, that being under water it may (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its ſoftneſſe) bee moulded into any ſhape, or figure whatſoever; but being once expoſed unto the open aire, it forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hardens, and is no more capable of change, and alteration: the like happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth unto our ſoules, who while they do continue in this Sea, o'th' world, are ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible of the different affections of good, and bad; according to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall appearances of things, which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on our fancies, incline our wills un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the following, or forſaking of them; but having once finiſhed their voyage heere, muſt alwayes weare the dreſſe of thoſe affections they have at parting hence, and reape their harveſt in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſuitable unto the ſeeds they have ſowed heere; according to that ſaying of the Apoſtle; <hi>quaecunque ſeminaverit ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo, eadem &amp; metet,</hi> whatſoever a man
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48400:32"/>
hath ſowed, the ſame alſo he ſhall reap.</p>
            <p>Let us examine the condition of one who hath abandoned himſelfe unto his ſenſuall luſts, and placing his chiefe good in them, hath imploied all the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and faculties of his Soule, in compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thoſe objects of his wiſhes, his ſtock of time is now exhauſted whileſt hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured onely to beguile it with the variety of choiſe delights; and death fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him buſie in the careſſing of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, hath violently ſnatched it from him. The ſtately Pallaces, vaſt Treaſures, and raviſhing beauties, whereof he thought himſelfe the owner, are now in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of another, and the poore Soule is expoſed naked upon the confines of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. Let us with the eyes of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation accompany her thither, and ſee what are her thoughts, what are her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments in that Countrey wherein as yet ſhe is a ſtranger. This rude alarme hath rouſ'd her now out of that pleaſing ſlumber, wherein ſhe retchleſſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the time allotted her to labour,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48400:33"/>
and ſhee is come unto the land of reſt, wherein ſhee muſt for all Eternity, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon the ſtocke ſhee hath brought with her: ſhe now begins to take a view thereof, and ſumming her accounts, ſhe findes that all her large poſſeſſions, ſumptuous Buildings, Friends, and Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, have parted with her at the houre of Death, that all her pleaſures are vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed like a Dreame, that her body for whoſe ſolace and delight all theſe were coveted, is mouldring into duſt, and aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; and that in fine of all that ſhee hath done; of all that ſhee hath ſeene, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or enjoyed, there remaines no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with her but her owne inordinate judgements, and affections, which like a raging fire burne her without conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, whileſt all her powers and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are racked inceſſantly, when ſhee conſiders the excellencie of what ſhee hath forgone, the unworthineſſe of what ſhe hath purſued, and the impoſſibility to retract her choice.</p>
            <p>All that which a moſt violent paſſion
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48400:33"/>
is able to produce in the moſt capable ſubject, is nothing in compariſon of her afflictions. Wee read that <hi>Pompeys</hi> wife (ſhee who was daughter unto <hi>Julius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar)</hi> died ſuddenly with the exceſſe of griefe cauſed by the love ſhe bare unto her husband, upon the ſight but of a bloudy garment; which ſhee knew had beene that day worne by him; and if we may believe the Poets, that ſame paſſion drew <hi>Orpheus</hi> to Hell among the Ghoſts, and Fiends in ſearch of his <hi>Euridice,</hi> as being company much more ſupportable unto him, then were his cares, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes occaſioned by her abſence: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! what compariſon is there betweene the cauſe of their afflictions? they ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their ſeperation from thoſe they loved but for a time, as being well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that although time would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore life to thoſe had loſt it: yet hee would certainly unite them to their loves by giving death to thoſe that ſought it: whereas Eternity (though infinite and boundleſſe) cannot in all the vaſtneſſe, of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48400:34"/>
extenſion, furniſh this ſoule with the leaſt ray of hope, that ſhe ſhal meet again with thoſe deceitfull pleaſures, wherin ſhe had eſtabliſhed her contentment.</p>
            <p>The miſeries wee ſuffer during our u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with our bodies, have ever with them this double comfort: <hi>viz.</hi> that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they themſelves wil change their Nature, or wee change our opinions touching the Nature of them. The courſe of things wee ſee is variable, and wee may probably imagine that as our joyes have paſſed, ſo alſo will thoſe things that do afflict us; or elſe; that the acquaintance wee ſhall make with mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſery; will in time ſo farre alter the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof, that wee ſhall bee no longer troubled at it. The ſtrongeſt Poyſons, do in tract of time, become naturall food to thoſe that are accuſtomed to them; as heeretofore, wee read, it happened unto that King, from whom we have the name and uſe of Mithridate; whereas the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of an Eternall condition, can never receive eaſe by any alteration, either in the things themſelves, or in the mindes
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48400:34"/>
of thoſe that ſuffer them: Becauſe Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is nothing elſe but a fixed inſtant all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes permanent; and time is ſo eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally neceſſary unto change, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee wrought but by his meanes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the before recited Maxime. <hi>In inſtanti non fit mutatio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The torment which <hi>Mazentius</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned (by <hi>Virgil</hi> in his Aeniods) uſed to his captives, hath ſome imperfect weake reſemblance of this poore ſoules condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that Tyrant uſed to faſten them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to dead bodies ioyning their hands, their feet, their mouths, their eyes, and all their other parts with thoſe of putrid carcaſſes. Let us conſider what were the thoughts of thoſe poor miſerable wretches, who though living in themſelves were by this union hindred from exerciſing any the actions of life; and notwithſtanding their natural averſion from ſtench, from rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and from corruption, were yet forced to converſe onely with them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing all the happineſſe of life, to entertaine thoſe diſmall objects,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48400:35"/>
which preſented them with nought but ghaſtlieneſſe, and terrour.</p>
            <p>That unto which thoſe wretches were compelled by outward violence is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect repreſentation of what happens to this ſoule by her depraved habits, and affections, ſhee hath made choice of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily delights, and pleaſures, as her chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt good; ſhe hath imployed during her life the faculty of her underſtanding in the contemplating, and that of her will in the enjoyment of them; the often rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of theſe acts, and judgements, have powerfully imprinted them within her, and being thus diſpoſed her tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall union with the bodie hath beene diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved; and ſhees becom a dweller in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; where (as I have already ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) ſhee is not capable of alteration, ſhee very well perceives the baſe unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and vanity of thoſe delights; and the impoſſibility of ever comming to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them, but cannot quit her inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to them, which not permitting her to exerciſe her faculties on objects worthy
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48400:35"/>
her ſelfe, fill her with notions of earthly, fading, and corruptible things: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (beginning to bee now ſenſible of her owne naturall perfections) ſhee cannot caſt a thought, but doth repleniſh her with horrour, with confuſion and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightment.</p>
            <p>The condition of a ſoule puffed up with pride of humane knowledge, or the ambitious deſire of Power, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, after her ſeperation from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, is yet much more deplorable, then that of the other. The failings of the one have proceeded from a groſſe ignorance of the true good was to be followed, and from a ſoft compliance with the bodie; whereas this other hath offended out of malice, and contempt of the firſt cauſe, from whom ſhee hath received her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the one is to bee looked on as a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Malefactor, whereas this other can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conſidered but as a Traytor, and a Rebell, who hath attempted to invade the rights of her Creator; and indeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to find out a wiſdome, and eſtabliſh
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48400:36"/>
a power which ſhould bee independant of him. Their paſſions are proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto the cauſes from whence they ſpring, ſo as if the one give her ſelfe over to the weake paſſions of griefe, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, this other falling from the height of her ambitious pretences, muſt needs abandon her ſelfe unto deſpairer to rage, and fury; ſhee hath beene ſo far blinded during this life by the opinion of her owne wiſdome, and ſufficiency, or dazeled with the falſe luſtre of her digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Power, that ſhe refuſed to ſtoop to the Divinity, and acknowledge him the onely giver of them: ſhe hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore propoſed her ſelfe unto her ſelfe as the maine end of all her actions, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus eſtabliſhed a chiefe good oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite unto that of all the other Creatures, and ſetled in her ſelfe the notions, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections thereof, ſhee hath beene ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the bodie. When comming to diſcover the true Nature and cauſe of things, ſhee findes that whatſoever hath a being, depends on God, as the firſt
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48400:36"/>
cauſe, and are willingly ſubordinate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him as the end, for which they were created; that her ſelfe is like a Prodigie in Nature, whom all the other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures exprobrate with this her vile ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, Treaſon, and Rebellion againſt their Maker; what can ſhee doe having thus proudly contemned her God? &amp; being her ſelfe forſaken and deteſted by all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, but ſeeke out a retirement in her ſelfe, where her proud thoughts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoyled of that falſe greatneſſe they had fancied; feed her continually with envy, rancour, and diſpite, againſt her fellow Creatures, and the Deity.</p>
            <p>Her caſe (in my opinion) hath ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance with that of <hi>Baiazet</hi> King of the Turkes, hee who was overcome and taken Priſoner by the great <hi>Tamerlane</hi>: this proud Prince ſaw himſelfe maſter of the better part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and having ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in his ambitious thoughts the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of the whole World, had beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Grecian Emperour in his Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall City which hee was upon the point
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48400:37"/>
of taking: but in the midſt of all his flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering proſperities he was invaded by this <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> who having defeated him in a great battle, cauſed him to bee ſhut up within an iron cage, in which being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, he expoſed him unto the mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of all his Army, and uſed him as a footſtoole to tread upon, whenſoever he had occaſion to get on horſebacke; what were the thoughts of this proud Tyrant who haveing lately had the diſpoſall of a World of men, and being regarded by them as a Deity; was ſuddenly become the ſcorne of Boies, and Lackies? and having formerly fancied to himſelfe the Empire of the World, was forced to ſerve another as his footſtoole? All his paſt greatneſſe, Power, and Proſperities, had now no other ſubſiſtance, but in his Memory, where they were alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, not to give eaſe to his afflictions, but to encreaſe the anguiſh and the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of them, by inſpiring him with thoughts of rage, and fury againſt God and men, by whom his expectations had
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48400:37"/>
beene ſo foulely diſappointed.</p>
            <p>Such we may fancy to our ſelves are the ravings of this poore ſoule; though with this difference, that <hi>Bajazet</hi> was able to avoid the trouble of them, by daſhing out his braines againſt the iorn barres of that his Priſon, whereas this ſoule can never quit her ſelfe from being perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by thoſe ſtings of conſcience ſhe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with her as her torturers for all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
            <p>Alas! how imperfect is that apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion wee have of the acts which a ſoule exerciſeth after her ſeperation from the bodie; by comparing them unto thoſe wee are capable of during this life? hee that ſhould eſtimate the motion of the <hi>primum mobile</hi>; according unto what hee ſees performed heere by a ſnaile; would not fall ſhorter in his conception of the Rapid ſwiftneſs, wherewith that Sphear is whirled about this Globe of Earth, then wee ſhall doe in ours, if wee reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the affections of joy, and griefe, which wee have heere during the union
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48400:38"/>
with our materiall bodies, to thoſe a ſoule hath when ſhee is ſevered from it; whether we ſhall conſider her huge acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, when ſhe is purely an immateriall ſubſtance, in compariſon of what ſhee hath when ſhee is clogged with fleſh and bloud; or the perfection of her operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when ſhe beholds clearly the things themſelves in their owne Natures, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out helpe of thoſe <hi>Ideas,</hi> or imperfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent aions of them in our fancies, which wee are forced to uſe during this life: or laſtly, the exemption from time, and place, by which our actions heere are all reſtrained, but can have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce at all with her, who is above the reach of time becauſe of her Eternall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; nor can bee circumſcribed in place, as having neither quantity nor matter, The affections of joy, and griefe, as they-reſide in the intellectuall appetite of man, are but impulſes of our wills upon our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faculties, which carry us on to the enjoying of the one, or ſhunning the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with more, or leſſe violence, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48400:38"/>
to the meaſure of the impreſſion wee receive touching the good, or evill of them; the force whereof depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the active motion of the ſoule, and therein that of one ſeperated, hugely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth what ſhee hath heere, while ſhee is mingled with the maſſe of our terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bodies; powder whereof wee have the dayly uſe, when it remaines united in the Maſſe whereof it is compoſed, is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſtrained by the weake cloſure of a Tunne, or Barrell; but if it once take fire will cauſe an Earthquake, and ſhake the frame of Nature if it bee hindred in its courſe towards the region of fire, which is the proper center, whereunto it tends. The ſoul hath ſome reſemblance unto this her paſſions, or impulſes; during her u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the bodie, are weake, and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but being once devided from it, ſhee then hath an activity ſurpaſſing that of fire, which makes her paſſions or impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, become ſo ſtrong and violent, that they bear no proportion at all with thoſe which we have heere, and enjoy nothing
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48400:39"/>
common with them, but their appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Their force is alſo very much encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, by the cleare ſight ſhe hath of things in their own Natures, without the helpe of any Species, drawne from the things, or the converſion of her ſelfe unto the Phantaſmes, from whence ariſeth the certainty of knowledge, incompatible with doubt, or with opinion (which are the greateſt enemies to action) ſince no man ever vehemently covets, or feares a thing, of whoſe Nature hee is uncertain. And, laſtly they are beyond meaſure heightened, by the exemption from time, and place, which ſhee enjoyes during her ſtate of ſeperation; whereby ſhee comprehends (after a ſort) all time and place, within her ſelfe. A little time, and a ſmall place, are capable onely of little al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, wee are not ſenſible of the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of one drop of water, whereas in time it hath the force to pierce the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Marble; and the Sunes beames, which being divided into ſundry places, have ſcarce the Power to warme us, doe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48400:39"/>
(when they are united, by a glaſſe) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a fire that burnes and ſcorceth. What ſhall wee ſay then of a paſſion, which hath Eternity, and an infinity of place for bounds of its continuance, and ſituation? all degrees of compariſon are heere exceeded, and wee muſt needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that all the miſeries whereof a man is capable during this life, are a meere nothing, in reſpect of what theſe wretched, wretched, ſoules, are forced to ſuffer towardes the expiation of their crimes, for all Eternity.</p>
            <p>What I have heere ſet downe hath beene to explicate the miſerable ſtate of thoſe unhappy ſoules during Eternity (according to the ordinary courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall cauſes) who deviating from the true good for the enjoyment whereof they were created, have purſued their owne vitious inclinations, and affections, in ſtead thereof. But who is hee that can bee able to diſcover the immenſe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which the ſtrict juſtice of an offended Deity, will inflict
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48400:40"/>
upon them, for their ungratitude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him? heere all expreſſion is dumb; and wee muſt needs acknowledge our hearts are too too narrow to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the vaſt abiſſes of his judgements, as well as the ouerflowing torrents of his mercies. Yet ſince himſelfe hath by his onely Sonne beene pleaſed to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſomething concerning them unto mankind; I ſhall with reverence draw neere; and without prying curiouſly into the hidden ſecrets of them, attempt to take a ſhort imperfect view of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, which the Divine iuſtice will order to bee made againſt theſe Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors for the condigne puniſhment of their offences.</p>
            <p>How deplorable is the condition of theſe ſoules according unto what I have deſcribed already? and yet how happy were it in reſpect of what it is, were they but left alone to bee tormented onely by themſelves? for they have ſcarce begun to make a ſad acquaintance with their miſeries, when they are ſuddenly inviro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48400:40"/>
with a multitude of Divells; whoſe ugly ſhapes cauſe an affrightment in them equall to that of the imployment upon which they come, and that is to convey them unto the dreadfull judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat of God. Theſe fiends do now begin to glory in the ſucceſſe of their temptations, and whileſt they drag them to the place where they are to receive the ſentence of their condemnation, practiſe upon them all thoſe barbarous cruelties, which an inſulting mercileſſe enemy, can uſe againſt a Captived wretch delivered over to his rage, and fury. They now have executed their commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and theſe poore guilty ſoules tremble with horrour to ſee themſelves preſented before the dreaded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> majeſty of him, whom having formerly rejected for their Advocate and their Redeemer, they muſt now ſubmit unto, as Judge of all their actions, and deportments; thoſe rayes of glory which ſtreaming from his ſacred perſon, repleniſh all the Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells with unſpeakeable content, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48400:41"/>
rleaſure, fill them with an exceſſe of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and deſpaire, by making them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the innocence wherein they were created, the happineſſe for which they were ordained, the baſe unworthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that for love whereof they have caſt off the firſt, and forfeited the latter; the prodigious uglineſſe of thoſe affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wherewith they now are filled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of them; and laſtly, that all this muſt bee proclaimed and juſtified againſt them before the dreadfull Majeſty of God, in preſence of the Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, by their owne conſciences, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as witneſſes againſt them to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſhame and infamy; ſo that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with a Legion of theſe torturing thoughts, as well as Divells; they know not whether of the two hath greater tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either the expectation of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, or the Execution of it.</p>
            <p>And yet that ſame is wonderfully ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, for they are thereby baniſhed from the preſence of Almighty God, and doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to live in Everlaſting Fire provided
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48400:41"/>
for the Divell and his Angells, from all Eternity. A diſmall manſion, whether wee ſhall conſider the place it ſelfe, which is a Region belching out perpetuall flames, and yet covered with an impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable darkeneſſe, or the ſociety of the inhabitants thereof (who are the Divels, implacable enemies of humane kinde) whoſe malice keepes them perpetually buſied in the invention of new torments, whereby to ad unto the greatneſs of their afflictions; or laſtly, their entertainments whileſt they abide there, which (as the Sonne of God himſelfe informes us) are weeping, &amp; gnaſhing of their teeth for all Eternity.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not goe about to reckon up the ſundry kindes of puniſhments inflicted there, on ſeverall perſons according to the Nature of their ſeverall crimes; the ſulphurous potions which the drunkard ſhall there bee forced to ſwallow downe inſtead of the delicious wines, wherein hee placed his greateſt happineſſe; the loathſome food wherewith the glutton
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48400:42"/>
ſhall there bee crammed, in lieu of his choice feaſts, and ſumptuous ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, the ſcornes, indignities, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, to which the proud ambitious man ſhall bee expoſed, in exchange of of that reſpect, and honour hee ſought for heere, and all thoſe different kindes of tortures which the Divine juſtice, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſeth with an admirable order, amid that horrour, and confuſion, according to the different crimes whereof thoſe ſoules have heere beene guilty; theſe have already beene copiouſly deciphered by other excellent pennes, and cannot bee compriſde by mee within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of this ſhort diſcourſe, nor doe I comprehend, how theſe materiall things may (by the ordinary courſe of Nature) worke any alteration in the immateriall ſoule, when ſhe is ſeperated from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (for I ſpeake nothing of her conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after the reſurrection, when ſhe ſhall bee againe united to it) but I muſt needs conclude her torments farr exceed the force of humane and underſtanding to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48400:42"/>
when I conſider, the infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of that God, for ſatisfaction of whoſe juſtice they are appointed; the abſolute unlimited Power of him by whoſe order they are inflicted; the huge activity of a ſeperated ſoule by whom they are ſuffered; and the endleſſe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of Eternity, during all which they are to be endured.</p>
            <p>We have accompanied theſe miſerable ſoules unto the brinke of that infernall lake, wherein who ever falles is irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably loſt for all Eternity; unhappy perſons, to have at all received a being, ſince they muſt there exchang the mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary pleaſures they have enjoyd in giving ſatisfaction to their own unbrideled appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, to live in everlaſting flames, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the Divells, and the ſting of their owne conſciences, more cruell to them then thoſe helliſh monſters, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom they are confined by the Divine juſtice, for their puniſhment, and our example.</p>

theſe ſad ſpectacles of horrour, and affrightment, turne all our thoughts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the contemplation of a ſoule, who du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring life hath propoſed God unto her ſelfe as her chiefe good, and entring into a ſerious conſideration of the unſpekable benefits ſhee hath received from him, in her creation, in her redemption, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall preſervation, hath by an act of generous gratitude caſt off all thoughts of Luſt, of Vanity, or Pride, whereunto ſhe was inclined by her concupiſcences, and affections, to ſacrifice her ſelfe inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely unto the performance of his will, and pleaſure; the Divine grace ſeconding theſe good diſpoſitions, hath ſo illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated her with the reſplendent beames of Heavenly light, that ſhee hath beene enabled to diſcover ſome little glimps of thoſe admirable perfections of her Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, the ſight whereof hath raviſhed all her Powers, ſo that enamored on his Celeſtiall beauty ſhe hath converſed du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her union with the body onely in Heaven, all her thoughts, wiſhes and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48400:43"/>
being continually preſent there where ſhe had placed her onely treaſure. Death, whoſe grim viſage affrights the moſt couragious ſpirits, is welcome to her, and ſhee doth quit with joy the baſe attire of fleſh, and of corruption, that ſhe may put on immortallity. Let us a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle conſider the bleſſedneſſe of her condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this ſtate of ſeperation.</p>
            <p>Knowledge, whoſe object is the true Nature, and cauſe of things, is ſo hard to be attained unto during this life, that the Philoſophers (who have imployed themſelves in ſearch of it) have a great part of them deſpaired of being able to find it out. The Academicks (a ſect of them much renowned in antient time) pronounced boldly that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing whatſoever, could be knowne; the Scepticks (proceeding ſomething more warily) held that no demonſtration could bee made, and did therefore continue doubtfull, denying their aſſent unto the truth of any propoſition. And thoſe Philoſophers (who following <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi>)
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48400:44"/>
have eſtabliſhed in our Schooles a forme of learning, doe (by a tyranny they exerciſe over our reaſon) command us to admit without proofe ſo many grounds, or principles; upon which they eſtabliſh the Doctrine they deliver, that divers of our choiceſt modern wits, have thence taken occaſion to diſpute againſt them, and to endeavour the overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all that ſtructure they have built upon them.</p>
            <p>This inextricable laberinth wherein truth is ſhut up, being impervious by mortall men, cauſed <hi>Socrates</hi> after all his ſtudy in ſearch of her, conclude, that hee was ignorant of all things elſe ſave onely this, that hee knew nothing, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire of being able to find her out, made <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> throw himſelfe headlong into the Ocean, after hee had long ſought in vaine to find the reaſon of its Ebbs and flowings.</p>
            <p>But ſhe who doth ſo carefully conceale her ſelfe from thoſe that live, expoſeth freely all her beauties to bee viewed over
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48400:44"/>
by this ſeperated ſoule, and fills her with the fulneſſe of that knowledge in one inſtant, whoſe ſmalleſt portion wee ſcarcely gaine by the continuall ſtudy of many ages; the contemplation whereof is a contentment infinitely ſurpaſſing all thoſe pleaſures which wee are capable of during this life. The Queene of <hi>Sheba,</hi> upon the fame onely of <hi>Salomons</hi> great wiſedome, thought it well worth her la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to quit the pleaſures of her Court, and expoſing her ſelfe unto the trouble, toile, and dangers incident to a long voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, came from the fartheſt part of all the Eaſt to finde him out, that ſhe might have the ſatisfaction to become a hearer of it. <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, priſed at ſo high a rate thoſe notions of Philoſophy he had received from <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> during the time he was his Pupill, that he was uſed to ſay, hee had a greater obligation to his Tutor then to his Father <hi>Phillip,</hi> and yet he had from him received his being, &amp; pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſufficient to make himſelfe the wonder of ſucceeding ages, by reaſon of his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48400:45"/>
victories, and conqueſts: and <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> (the great Artiſt) had all his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and faculties, ſo wholly taken up, by the contentment hee found in ſpeculating of thoſe demonſtrations he had invented touching the Symetry and proportion of bodies, that all the rage, and fury, was practiſed, at the taking in of <hi>Siracuſa,</hi> &amp; the deſtruction of theſe innocent inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, which peopled that unlucky City (whereof himſelfe was one) could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert him from the pleaſure of it, or once afford him leaſure to make anſwer unto a Souldier, who asked his name, with an intention to have preſreved him.</p>
            <p>If this ſmall dawne of knowledge hath appeared unto the eyes of the beholders with ſo glorious a luſter, as made it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrable before the ſumptuous magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences of a ſplendid Court, the glittering brightneſſe of a Crowne, and Scepter, or life it ſelfe, what ſhall we ſay of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of pleaſure wherewith this ſoule is filled, when ſhee enjoyes the fullneſſe of all knowledge, and clearely ſees the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48400:45"/>
Nature, properties, and qualities, of all the workmanſhips of God? when ſhe beholds his admirable Wiſdome, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Providence, exerciſed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall upholding of this huge fabrick? and how from the great contrariety and ſtrife there is betweene the parts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is compoſed, he drawes the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the whole, by a perpetuall Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of generation, and corruption: how death which ſeemes to bee ordained for deſtroying the ſociety of humane kinde, is the maine Baſis whereupon it reſtes; becauſe the feare thereof witholds viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons from falling headlong into the depth of wickedneſſe, and the hope of it animates vertuous men to perſiſt conſtantly, in the rough craggy wayes of good, and vertue. Thoſe rare effects of Nature that puzzle all our choiceſt wits in ſearching out their hidden cauſes, are then made eaſie to her, and ſhee doth plainly underſtand, whether the fluxes and refluxes of the Ocean, are guided by the motion of the Moone, or the impulſe
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48400:46"/>
of that continuall winde, raiſed under the Equator by the Sunne, whether that conſtant inclination of the Loadſtone to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North, whereby wee are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to make diſcoveries of the remoteſt creekes and corners of the Sea, is cauſed by an attractive quallity reſiding in the poles of the earth, which being ſomwhat different from thoſe wee fancy in the Heavens, produceth that ſmall variation we obſerve dayly in the Compaſſe, or by thoſe ſtreames of atomes, drawne by the Sunnes great heate betweene the Tro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pickes, which flowing ever more from North to South, and penetrating all the ſubtile pores, whereof the ſtone is full while it remaines within the Earth in that poſition, doth in continuance of time beget this property, which wee can imitate by often heating of an iron, and placing it to coole (while yet the por<gap reason="illegible: page cropped" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

to the needle, and that whereby it attracts iron to it ſelfe, depend on cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes whereof as yet mankinde is ignorant, whoſe knowledge is by providence reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the diſcovery of poſterity in that age which ſhall ſucceede us, as the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience was to thoſe in that which went before us. Whether the cherefull light, which wee ſee darted by the Sunne from Eaſt, to Weſt, is but a quallity commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated by him in an inſtant to all the aire, throughout the vaſt extent of our horiſon, or is the body of the fire it ſelfe, which being the moſt active Element, and flowing from the Sunne, as from its fountaine, into the liquid Element of aire, prevents by its vaſt diſtance from us, huge expanſion, and active ſwiftneſſe, our feeling, and our ſight, from being ſenſible of any thing which might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our underſtanding, touching the meaſure of its heat and motion. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the never ceaſing turnes we have of day, and night, proceed from the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall motion of all the Heavens, carried
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48400:47"/>
about by the great violence of the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum mobile,</hi> or from the motion of the Earth on its owne Axis, expoſing all the ſeverall partes of it ſucceſſively, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened by the Sunne; Whether the Planets are fixed; each of them in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Spheare, whoſe motion doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their courſes; or (which ſome think they can demonſtrate of the Sunne) moove all of them (except the moone) upon their ſeverall Axes like the Earth. How far their different influences, and aſpects, governe all ſublunary bodies, cauſing the birthes and periods, of States, and Monarchies, and the perticular hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe and miſeries of private men.</p>
            <p>But above all ſhee is intirely ſatisfied with ſeeing, how the infalibillity of Gods preſcience, infringeth not the liberty of mans free will. How nothing heere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, happens by chance, but that his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence diſpoſing ſweetly all thoſe things which he hath wrought, permits the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of good, and proſperities of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men for the advantage of his ſervice;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48400:47"/>
by exerciſing and inſtructing of the one, and by reclaiming of the other, and how in fine by the inſcrutable Meanders of his judgements hee ordereth ſo, that all the villany, and wickedneſſe is practiſed heere, cooperates unto the good of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and the increaſe of his owne glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>In theſe imployments ſhe might with joy ſpend an infinity of time, were ſhee not taken off by others of much more delight, and conſequence. For ſhee no ſooner leaves times region and comes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the confines of Eternity, but ſhees attended by a troope of Angels, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to convoy her unto the glorious Court of her Creator, and ſhee receives by them an invitation is ſent unto her by God himſelfe, like unto that wee read of in the Canticles. <hi>I am hiems tranſiit im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber abiit, &amp; receſſit ſunge amica mea &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni.</hi> My friend the winter of thy chilling cares, and feares, is paſt, the ſhowers of all thy teares are now blowne over, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe therefore and mount up unto the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

bleſſed dwelling of Eternity. Who can expreſſe thoſe extaſies of joy this ſummons cauſeth? or fancy to himſelfe the leaſt Idea of thoſe pleaſing raptures wherewith ſhe is poſſeſſed, when ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the beauties of the imperiall Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which now ſtands open to receive her?</p>
            <p>Thoſe holy Saints and pious men, who have endeavoured to inflame us with the love of vertue by hope of the reward to come; accommodating their expreſſions to our conceits, deſcribe it to us like a ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Citty, built all of Gold and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtones, whoſe gates are each of them compoſed of one entire Pearle, whoſe walles are made not for defence but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, becauſe her enemies are all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and ſhee eſtabliſhed in ſecurity, above the reach of time or fortune whoſe houſes are of Jaſper, and of Porphyrie, inlaid with Rubies, Diamonds, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncles, where Gold and polliſhed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, are not imployed but for the meaneſt uſes. Every of whoſe inhabitants is a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48400:48"/>
great King, and hath Dominion over all the workes of Nature, a beauty that out ſhines the Sun in greateſt height of all his glory, an activity ſurpaſſing that of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, accompanied with youth, and health, which never ſhall decay for all Eternity. Within the circuit of thoſe walles, they represent unto us a large field, beautified with all the choiſe vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of flowers that can bee thought on, whoſe fragrant ſmell ſends forth a moſt delicious perfume to the ſenſes; in mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt whereof paſſeth a purling ſtreame of living waters, which who ſo taſts, ſhall never thirſt for all Eternity: where a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall ſpring preſerves all plants, in the full freſhneſſe of their prime and verdure, where an Eternall day ſuffers not the leaſt Eclips of night, or darkeneſſe, there all the bleſſed dwellers in this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Country doe entertaine each other in perfect love, and concord, with fulneſs of all joyes, and pleaſures, whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate happineſſe can never be diſturbed, by the unwelcome preſence of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48400:49"/>
or the ſad parting of a friend.</p>
            <p>What a meere nothing, are all the flattering ſhadowes of content we graſpe at during life, being compared to thoſe of this Celeſtiall manſion, which I have heere deſcribed? yet theſe are the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide onely of their joyes, not to bee priſed at all, if once compared to that wherin conſiſts the Eſſence, of their perfect bliſs, and happineſſe. Gold, Marble, precious ſtones, faire fields, coole ſprings the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Saints and Angells, Soveraigne power, beauty, activity, youth, health, impaſſibility, and immortallity it ſelfe can never ſatisfie the immateriall ſoule, without the viſion of her Lord and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, this is the center whereunto ſhee sendes, the object of her powers, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; this being once obtained, brings with it full repoſe, and quietneſſe, which all created things can never doe. And this is heere communicated freely to her, whereby her underſtanding is fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, with the cleare knowledge of all thinges, by ſight of him who is both the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48400:49"/>
firſt cauſe, and truth it ſelfe. Her will finds alſo heere what ever object it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth, in the ſecure poſſeſſion of all good thinges, which are united in his Nature who is good it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Who can deſcribe the infinite advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, prerogatives, and dignities, that doe accompany this bleſſed viſion? words are too feeble to expreſſe, and humane hearts (though nere ſo large) are too too narrow to conceive them.</p>
            <p>Let us conclude; that as that man who doth pertake of wiſedome is truly wiſe, and who hath courage becommeth valiant, even ſo this bleſſed ſoule, being ingulf'd in contemplation of the diety, by the ſtrict union which that cauſeth of all her faculties to him, is in ſome ſort a God, enjoying all perfections by partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, which God himſelfe hath by propriety.</p>

            <p>Reader having finiſhed theſe two firſt heads of this Diſcourſe, to wit, a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what Eternity is, and what our
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48400:50"/>
condition will be when we ſhall come to be pertakers of it; there remained in the laſt place, that I ſhould according to my promiſe, have ſet downe ſuch rules for the conduct of our lives, whileſt wee are heere, as might (being obſerved) render us perfectly happy when we ſhould come to be inhabitants in that our country.</p>
            <p>Theſe rules I meaned ſhould have compriſed within them all the vertues, which may bee well reduced into two heads; that is to ſay, thoſe which have for their object the Divinity it ſelfe, and thoſe that ſerve for the well ordering, and diſpoſing of our actions.</p>
            <p>The principall ones of the firſt kinde, are thoſe wee call the Theologicall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, Faith, Hope, and Charity, whereof, the firſt breeds in us a perfect reſignation of our underſtandings unto God, by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting with humillity and conſtancy, without doubt, or heſitation, unto thoſe truths which hee hath pleaſed to reveale to us for the ſalvation of our ſoules: the ſecond makes us with patience and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48400:50"/>
continue in the way of vertue; expecting to bee made pertakers of all thoſe bleſſings hee hath promiſed to his ſervants; and the third cauſeth, an entire union of our will with his, which is the greateſt heigth of Chriſtian perfection, and the aſſured meanes to attaine unto an everlaſting bliſſe.</p>
            <p>Among thoſe of the ſecond kinde (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the morall vertues) the chiefeſt are, Prudence, Juſtice, Fortitude, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, (commonly called the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Vertues) which ſerve for the well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and diſpoſing of all the faculties, paſſions, and affections, of our Soules. Prudence, which ought to preſide in all the conſultations of our underſtanding; Juſtice, to governe all the reſolutions of our will; Fortitude, to keepe in due ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection the paſſions compriſed under the generall notion of the iraſcible part of man; and Temperance, to bridle the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitancie of our concupiſcences, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
            <p>I had intended to have deſcribed at
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48400:51"/>
large the Nature, and the quallities, of all theſe vertues, and to have ſhewed, how all the other may be deduced out of theſe ſeven, by reaſon of the connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and relation they have unto each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and I had meant, in the contexture of that Diſcourſe, to have ſet downe the way, and meanes, to purge our Soules from all the depraved inclinations, and habits, which are oppoſite unto them, that being thereby cleanſed, from all the ruſt and filth of ſin, they might become capable ſubjects of being illuminated by the Divine grace, and bee enabled to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his admirable goodneſſe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, whereon being enamoured, they might by fervent acts of charity unite their wills entirely unto his, and thereby mount unto the top of Chriſtian perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, which is the aſſured meanes of being happy in Eternity.</p>
            <p>I ſay I had intended, for (although I had ſpent ſome time in the digeſting, and ordring of this matter) yet I was put unto a ſtand in that deſigne, by a reflexion
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48400:51"/>
which I chanced to make upon a ſaying of that glorious Saint, and Doctor in the Church of God, Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who writing unto ſome of the <hi>Ethnicks,</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lives and ſtudies of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſpeakes thus, <hi>Philoſophi factis no ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis ſumus, nec magna loquimur, ſed vivimus,</hi> that is, wee are Philoſophers in our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not in our wordes, nor do we ſpeake great things but practiſe them. It ſeemes this holy man thought it much fitter for a Chriſtian, to exerciſe himſelfe in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous actions then in deſcribing the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the vertues.</p>
            <p>Now this opinion of ſo grave and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend a Father of the Church, having at firſt cauſed mee to doubt, whether I ſhould proceed to perfecting the worke I had in hand; I tooke a reſolution ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time after to give it over, upon the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a paſſage, reported by ſome wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the life of <hi>Origen,</hi> (that prodigy of wit and learning) they ſet downe that being in his old Age ſenſible of divers er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours he had runne into (which made his
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48400:52"/>
followers be condemned as Hereticks) he came into the Church with an intention to expound ſome paſſage out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for the inſtruction of the people; and to that purpoſe opening the booke, hee chanced to light upon a paſſage in the Pſalmes of <hi>David</hi>; wherein the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaking of God, ſaith thus, <hi>Peccato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri dixit, quare tu enarras gloriam meam, &amp; aſſumis teſtamentum meum, in os tuum.</hi> In Engliſh thus, He (meaning God) ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſinner, wherefore doſt thou ſhew forth my glory and doeſt aſſume my teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into thy mouth. The pennitent old man, taking this reproofe as ſpoken to himſelfe, burſt forth into a floud of teares, which tooke from him the uſe of ſpeech, and retiring out of the Church, abandoned all the thoughts of teaching others, that he might ſpend the ſhort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his life in the reforming of himſelfe.</p>
            <p>The reaſons which prevailed with this great Doctor, have wrought the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect with mee, and I reſolved to quit the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48400:52"/>
farther buſying of myſelfe in an imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein I was forbidden to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle by reaſon of my ſinnes; and which I was unable to performe, becauſe I am a ſtranger to the practiſe of thoſe vertues I ſhould write of, and ſo might juſtly feare that inconvenience would thereby happen, whereof wee are forewarned by our Bleſſed Saviour in the Goſpell, to wit, that if the blind ſhall lead the blind, they both will fall together in the pit.</p>
            <p>Heere therefore I give end to this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, with this advertiſment onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the pious Reader, that if he ſhall deſire to have his heart enflamed with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love, he muſt firſt neceſſarily cleanſe it from all affections unto fading, and tranſitory things. <hi>Suetonius</hi> in the lives of the twelve firſt <hi>Caeſars,</hi> relates, that when the body of the Emperour <hi>Titus</hi> was placed in the Funerall pile, to be conſumed with fire (according to the cuſtome of thoſe times) his heart (after his body was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into aſhes) did many times ſpring
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48400:53"/>
out of the flames, and being at laſt ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by thoſe who wondred at the strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the accident, it was found to bee full of poyſon; which hindred the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the fire upon it. Even ſo our Soules, while they continue fraught with the inordinate love of earthly things (which are the mortall poiſon of the Soule) reſist the inſpiration of the Holy Spirit, and ſuffer not themſelves to be inflamed by the Celeſtiall fire of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which he doth never faile to kindle in thoſe hearts are fitted to receive it.</p>
            <p>The readieſt way for the devout Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to effect this, is wholly to imploy his thoughts, and ſtudies, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall meditation upon Eternity, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if he be farthered by any thing which I have heere ſet downe, I then deſire, that as I have made him partaker of my meditations, ſo hee would alſo make mee pertaker with him in his Prayers.</p>
