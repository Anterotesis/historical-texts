            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>HENRY PARKER</hi> having ſerved the Parliament as Secretary to the Committee of Safety, and to the Lord Generall, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> from the firſt raiſing of the Army, and having done ſome other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, acceptable ſervice beſides; on the <hi>18.</hi> of <hi>November 1643.</hi> Petitioned the Honourable Houſe of Commons for the Sequeſtred Place of Mr. <hi>Abbot:</hi> Whereupon this Order was made:
<q>
                  <hi>The humble Petition of</hi> Henry Parker <hi>Gent. (eſpecially recommended by my Lord Generall) was read, and Ordered to be referred to Mr.</hi> White, <hi>Mr.</hi> Selden, <hi>Mr. Solliciter, Mr.</hi> Prideaux, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Brown, <hi>to conſider what is fit for the Houſe to do further upon it, &amp; to report their opinions. Ordered, That the Houſe do declare, that they are ſenſible of the good ſervice Mr.</hi> Parker <hi>hath done to the Common wealth, and they will in this particular mentioned in his Petition, or in ſomething elſe as advantagious, conſider him for his good ſervice.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This Committee appointed to report their opinions about the Prerogative Office, and what was fit to be done in confirmation or alteration of the ſame, either met not, or concluded nothing therein, being diverted by weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, and more publike imployments.</p>
            <p>About <hi>June</hi> following the Judges place of the Prerogative being of more neceſſity to be ſetled without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delay; another Committee was appointed to prepare an Ordinance for ſetling the ſame, and that was ſetled accordingly.</p>
            <p>The Judges place being ſetled, and the Regiſters place thereby more cleared of ſome objections, and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that at firſt contravened about the ſame: Mr. <hi>Abbot</hi> thought it a fit time to appeare, after his long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, and to plead to his Delinquency: Mr. <hi>Oldſworth</hi> alſo procured an Ordinance to be read in the Houſe, for inveſting himſelf in Mr. <hi>Abbots</hi> place: and <hi>Henry Parker</hi> again Petitioned, that he might enjoy the benefit of his former order, and was therin again recommended to the Houſe by the letters both of Sir <hi>VVill. VValler,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Eſſex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon all the pretences of Mr. <hi>Abbot,</hi> Mr. <hi>Oldſworth,</hi> and <hi>Henry Parker</hi> were referred to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by another Committee which met ſometimes, and (after a long time ſpent) made ſome entrance in trying Mr. <hi>Abbots</hi> Delinquency; which could not be made clear to them till of late: but it is now laid open and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſufficiently; as is ready to be reported.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Parkers</hi> ſuit therefore now is, that ſince the Houſe did firſt intend him this place, or ſomething elſe as advantagious, in caſe this proved not feaſible: and did add this clauſe for his benefit, and not becauſe he ſhould be put off upon further attendance or expectation. And for as much as Mr. <hi>Oldſworth</hi> is not only barred in ſome degree by the ſelf-denying Ordinance, but was alſo a Competitor ſubſequent in time: and it doth not appear, that he made any formall requeſt to the Houſe for this place (acquainting them withall how far the Houſe had condiſcended before, about the ſame) but proceeded directly by way of Ordinance, for poſſeſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of that place: All the premiſes conſidered; That he may be made capable of that favour which the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Houſes Order firſt intended him.</p>
            <p>His Friends may alſo urge in his behalfe:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> That the ſaid <hi>Parker</hi> never ſought for any ſtipend from the State, nor ever received penny under that name; but did disburſe ſome monies for the State, upon ſpeciall command and order; of which there is <hi>100. li.</hi> yet unpaid.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> That though he was once for a ſhort time placed ſo, as that he might have reaped much benefit by it, if he would have exacted upon poor ſouldiers; yet he was ſo far from that, that he would never ſtrictly demand any thing as due, nor ſuffer his Clerks; but did inſtead of gaining, ſometimes loſe by ſome Officers that were in want.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> That when he left this Kingdome, and betook himſelf to ſerve the Merchants at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> he was driven thereunto by neceſſity; and becauſe he was loft to preſs upon the State for a ſubſiſtence, and not out of any want of zeal: and this he preſented in an humble Petition at his departure, though he could not procure the ſame to be read.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> That his attendance upon this buſineſs of the Regiſters Office ſo many years, hath not only put him to trouble and paines, but alſo to ſome charge and difficulty.</p>
