            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS Prince Rupert.</head>
            <p>MY ambition of dedicating this to your Royal Highness, proceeds not from the more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary encouragement it receiv'd from you, when it appear'd on the Stage: tho' of thirty times it has been acted, you seldom fail'd to honour it with your presence. 'Twould be presumption in me to examine why you did it that Grace; and vain-glory to attribute it to the merits of the Play, since the best have not receiv'd the like honour.</p>
            <p>Nor does the envie of Criticks force me to invoke your Princely Patronage; it were as vain to think the name of a Patron should shield it from their censures, as it would hinder the rude rable (if engrav'd on the front of a house) from breaking the windows. The malice of these, and the rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the others may lead 'em to do either, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing them they are guilty of any disrespect. And Criticks stand up as zealously for the liberty of their Tongues, as Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks for liberty of Conscience; and rail as spitefully against Plays, as that perverse Generation does against Magistrates and Governours.</p>
            <p>The third common pretence of Authors I likewise disown: I boast not of any particular favours receiv'd; blessings flow from Princes, as light does from the Sun, which shines on all at once. They oblige not <hi>Persons,</hi> but <hi>Nations:</hi> Of that great Vertue, SIR, you stand a glorious Example. You en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd your self in our intestine dissentions: You was the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolt of War; the enemies where-ever you came, or fled or fell before you: You threw your self into the storm to
<pb facs="tcp:99070:3"/>
save us; and when it had shipwrack'd the best of Monarchs, your Piety led you to exile with the Son: when his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Subjects forsook him, you did not; but with him shar'd the dangers and hardships of banishment, till Heaven (which laid the yoke of tyranny for punishment on our rebellious necks) was pleas'd to restore him to us, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther us to our King. The Sun had it been so long absent, could not be more welcome; with him like a train of glorious Lights, return'd the Royal Family, and not long after your Royal Self; after you you drew a chain of Blessings, Freedom, Peace, Religion, Unity, which ever since we have enjoyed: What foes we have abroad, we need not fear, whilst we have your Counsel for Conduct, and your Sword for Execution. You still like <hi>Englands</hi> Angel Guardian stand ready to defend it; and so long as we have either Memory or Gratitude, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very tongue must speak your fame, and every heart dedicate it self to you as a Trophee, owing to your gallantry. What a noble stock of Virtue must you have so entirely to captivate the hearts of a Nation, to which you was born a stranger! Who, when they hear your name, or see it here prefixt, will not repeat it, and say, You are the Heroe of the world; then in a transport run o'er your mighty Deeds and Actions, which make you famous above mankind in our present Annals, and will with excess of Glory bear your name to after Ages? How just an occasion have I here, to say all that can be said of man without danger of being thought a flatterer? But, Sir, were you less than what you are, I could say more: Now all is truth, nor can that truth be contain'd in an Epistle. And I know the perfect Heroe blushes as much at the narration of his Virtues, as the Lady exactly Beautiful at the relation of her Perfections: Praise seems to lessen both, for 'tis thought we rather speak what they should be, than what they are. Virtue ought to find Imitators, and Beauty more admirers than commenders: Nor would I give the most malicious any ground to think you can be flatter'd; or that I hope by flattery and insinuation to make attonement for this presumption: Your Virtues drew it on you; those Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
<pb facs="tcp:99070:3"/>
which have so much oblig'd our Nation, engage all hearts to pay our thanks as tribute to you: Involv'd in the common fate, I take this occasion to attest my acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to beg your Royal Highness to look upon this, not so much the Dedication of a Play, as of a Heart. That o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Poets stand at an awful distance, argues not my rudeness, but the greatness of my zeal which prompts me to believe that the boldness of performing so great a Duty, is not a crime e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the forbearance; And I shall account it my glory to have led the way, where others made a stand.</p>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Nor is he one you call a Town-Gallant,</l>
               <l>Who for fine cloathes does seldom money want:</l>
               <l>But drives at cheaper rates the sinful trade,</l>
               <l>Seduces Wives, sometimes a Chamber-maid:</l>
               <l>That at <hi>Jero's</hi> or <hi>Satt'lins</hi> goes to dinner;</l>
               <l>And thence repairs to th' Play to meet a sinner:</l>
               <l>And here with <hi>Burgundy</hi> and brisk sableé</l>
               <l>Inspir'd, with vizard-Masque holds reparteé.</l>
               <l>After the Play in joulting Hack he goes,</l>
               <l>Where his companions have their Rendevouz.</l>
               <l>In pairs they meet; and <hi>Ala mode</hi> of <hi>France</hi>
               </l>
               <l>They sup, they have the fiddles too and dance:</l>
               <l>Tow'rds morning, when they think of going home,</l>
               <l>Each Gallant on a Couch in the next room,</l>
               <l>In's turn, takes gentle solace with his Punk;</l>
               <l>Drops her a Guinney, and sends her home half drunk.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>All of that Gang by this confession too</l>

               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:99070:5"/>He is a man as modest for his age,</l>
               <l>As most you've seen, who know him dare engage</l>
               <l>That he has kept 'till now his pusillage.</l>
               <l>But alas! the world to that pass is grown,</l>
               <l>The modish women are asham'd to own</l>
               <l>A sober man: to like his Play will be,</l>
               <l>As great a scandal as his companie.</l>
               <l>For he observes, and it is very true,</l>
               <l>That modesty's not much approv'd in you.</l>
               <l>And is of late so out of fashion grown,</l>
               <l>She that is honest scarcely dares it own.</l>
               <l>But does, howe'er her mind affected is,</l>
               <l>Put on the brisk gay carriage of a Miss.</l>

               <l>But Ladies, hope the Poet one day may</l>
               <l>Converted be; for he that writes a Play,</l>
               <l>If not debauch'd, yet is in a fair way.</l>
               <l>To gain your favours he resolves to be</l>
               <l>In all the Town the greatest debaucheé:</l>

                  <p>I do, and ever shall. She did admit my addresses till my Father's pretensions interrupted the course of my love; her father, poor Knight, is old and decrepid, has but a very slender fortune, and is glad of this occasion to dispose of his daughter to a man of estate.</p>

                  <p>No more than our purpose requires. I'l tell you in what a pleasant posture I found him when I got to the Inn, last night. A servant chanc'd to leave open the door of the Room where he was at supper; looking in, I saw him sit at table with his Hostess, who was a notable fat burley Dame; he not being well after his journey, bespoak a Sack-posset, and invited her to the eating of it.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Trick.</speaker>
                  <p>Twas thus. One leg with a slipper at the end of it (and that no very cleanly one) was laid upon one corner of the Table, the other in her lap, his left arm about her neck, embracing: in this manner he sat for some time, telling her the occasion of his coming to Town; that it was love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that his Mistress was such a one (naming you, Madam). His ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stess to gratifie the relation he had made her, drank your health to him in the posset, he went to pledge it, but was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the middle of his draught with a coughing and sneezing, which broak out with such a violence, that all he had drank flew out at his nose and mouth into his Land-ladies face; she making a start from her chair threw him backward, he keeps his hold, draws her after him; down comes she, the posset between 'em, and her coats over 'em. A terrible out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry there was, and I ran in amongst the rest to help: when with much ado we had found the way to take her off the right end upward, there we saw Sir <hi>Simon</hi> lying half drown'd in posset, and half smother'd with Petty coats.</p>

                  <p>Now I mean to touch the Therapeia, and remedies which ought to be prescribed to effect a perfect cure. First, then to remedy this Plethora, and this Cacochymia, or general depravation of humours throughout all the body; my advice is for Phlebotomy; that he bleed freely; that is to say, plentifully; first of the Basilick, then of the Cephalick vein; and if the disease prove obstinate and refractory, that a vein be opened in his forehead, and that the orifice be very large, that the thick corrupted bloud may have passage; and at the same time that he purge, deopitulate and evacuate by proper and convenient purgations; that is to say, by Chola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, Melanogogues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But before all these, I find it meet to exhilarate his spirits with harmony resulting from Musick instrumental and vocal, with which it will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss to joyn some Dancers; to the end that their motions, postures, and agility of bodies, may excite, stirr up, and quicken his spirits stupified with idleness, which occasions the thickness of his bloud, from whence proceeds the Malady: these are the Remedies I prescribe, which may be much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantag'd by some others of yours much better and more effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious,

                  <p>The said Sir <hi>Simon</hi> is come to Town to marry the Daughter of one Mr. <hi>Iorden,</hi> a rich man.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Iord.</speaker>
                  <p>So.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Trick.</speaker>
                  <p>Now this Sir <hi>Simon</hi> owing much money to me, and five other Merchants of <hi>Norwich,</hi> we have all his land in mortage; but we being all his Fathers Friends, and having a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect for the Son, are willing to do him all the good we can; and therefore do underhand mannage the business so, combining with the said Sir <hi>Simon,</hi> that the Mortgages and Engagements shall not appear to endamage his Marriage.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Clev.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, Sir.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cur.</speaker>
                  <p>Now comes the design.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Trick.</speaker>
                  <p>So that Sir <hi>Simon</hi> may, besides the portion he is to have with his wife, take up of his Father-in-Law (who we hear is a mony'd man) as much money as will pay all his debts, and engage to him his land before engag'd to us.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Iord.</speaker>
                  <p>O dainty Rascals!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cur.</speaker>
                  <p>And then shall your Mortgage start up and take it from him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Clev.</speaker>
                  <p>So shall the Son cheat the Father-in-Law, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have no remedy for it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Trick.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, Sir, and this may easily be done, for Mr. <hi>Iorden</hi> is but a half-witted fellow.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Iord.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, is he so, Rascal?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Trick.</speaker>
                  <p>The said Land passes already currant for the joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, tho' mannag'd by his Brother in the Country, who is not much wiser than himself.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Trick.</speaker>
                  <p>Now, Gentlemen, this Sir <hi>Simon</hi> being also a man of a thick scull, and not so sensible of his own good, as he ought to be; I, and the other five Merchants do desire of Mr. Doctor, to perswade Sir <hi>Simon</hi> to strike up the Match, and be marryed before he enter into his course of Physick, that the design so well laid may not take wind, and miscarry by his folly and want of discretion.</p>

                  <p>Let me think a little whether I may do it in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. 'Tis a man who seeks his own good, who endeavours to provide for his Daughter, as advantagiously as he can. I ought to injure no man. These things are known truths: And then I go about to discover to a man that is ignorant of them. 'Tis forbidden to speak ill of our Neighbour.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Trick.</speaker>
                  <p>But on the other side, here is a stranger he would
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99070:36"/>
surprise, and one who comes with a good intent to marry his Daughter, whom he knows not, nor ever saw; a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man free and curteous, for whom I have a kindness, who does me the honour to esteem me his friend; reposes confidence in me, who gives me a Ring to wear for his sake, and Gold. Well, I find I can tell you all without scruple of conscience. But I'l take care to tell you as blamelesly as I can, and to spare the person as much as may be. To tell you then, this daughter of his lives dishonestly would be too harsh; I'l find some milder term to express my meaning; to say she's gallanted is not enough, but I think it will suit well with my meaning, to say she is a naughty pack; and may serve to let you know truly what she is.</p>

                  <p>It may be she is not so bad as the talk goes, and since there are some young women that expose themselves to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure by taking too much liberty, not thinking their honour and reputation depends—</p>

power not to see him again, and it was my desire the Lodging you were to provide me should be near that persons house; but pray make no more words on't, said she; then blush'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and turn'd away and sigh'd.</p>
